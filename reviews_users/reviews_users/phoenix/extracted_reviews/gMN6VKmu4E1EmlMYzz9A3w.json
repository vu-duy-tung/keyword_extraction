Large serving of lettuce with a good amount of tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers, and feta cheese. Now....the Caprese salad was on another level of brilliant. The balsamic drizzle was spectacular. I would even recommend ordering it as an appetizer. The staff was talkative and friendly. Can't wait to come again for lunch or for one of their many evening musical appearances.",

    "text": "I will start off saying that my husband and I have made it a business to try as many gyro places as we can to find one that revels closest to The Greek Pita (N Phoenix).  I looked on yelp when I started my new job to see what I could find.  This place showed up and the reviews were off the chart.  Today, I decided it was time (there is another place in the Fry's parking lot that I tried previously and would give 3-4 stars to)....I now wonder two things. 1. if everyone that is going here is stoned and just has the munchies or 2. If I somewhere along the way have been so spoiled by my place that every other gyro place will never make it out alive.    Let's start with the basics.  The place itself is in a great strip area on Baseline.  It's got a fabulous patio setup and you walk inside to a huge (unexpected) clean restaurant.  It was more than half empty on a Friday during lunch hour though...maybe that should have been a clue to bail...but I stayed since I had already ordered my food via phone in.    Food.  The quantity of the food content is great.  My to-go container was FULL.  I looked at it for a moment and then I started to LOOK at it.  The first thing I noticed was it looked like they forgot my tzansiki (sp?) sauce.  I was like okay, well that sucks, but went to eat anyways.  The sauce was there, but it was more of a water down yogurt dressing with little seasoning to it.  No cucumber, dill, lemon taste at all (and had it been better, this could have easily changed my stars).  Because the sauce was put directly on the pita, I couldn't pick it up at all so I had to use a knife and fork.  I thought that was weird.  The meat was ok.  I'll be honest, I can usually taste the marry of the beef and lamb, but I'm not even sure I got both and I definitely didn't get a lot of meat on it.  It tasted like overcooked, under seasoned beef.  It had a weird red coloring on it also, but there was no flavor with it.  The abundaince of my gyro was a lot of shredded lettuce and tomato (it's a gyro, not a taco).  The fries were basic, fries with no salt and kind of soggy (probably from my soggy pita bread).    So there you have it.  I would say I'm going to try it again, but like I said, there is another place almost directly across the street with better sauce and meat...a little more price (like $1) but that would be work it.  A short tip, as about another cup or two to your sauce with some lemon, dill and CUCUMBERS for your sauce, learn to salt and pepper a bit and parchment paper to separate fries from gyro (if you can't sauce on top) and I might be back.",

Usually, the gyros meat would be sliced from a spit, so it was nice and hot and had just a touch of crispness to it. Most good gyros joints would serve the Kronos brand. Unfortunately, Opa failed on both counts. There are many terrific gyros stops in the Phoenix area. Sadly, this place isn't one of them",

Prices were pretty outrageous for a place you walk up and order from but the great service and food brought us back.  2nd time the service was poor. The lady seemed to be hating life and didn't offer a single smile or pleasantry. I paid 14 bucks for a plate of chicken, rice, veggies and a pita which I wouldn't mind if it were a sit-down-and-get-served restaurant but you walk up and order and then they call your name (or bring it to you if they aren't too busy).   Bottom line: Good food and nice atmosphere but won't be back due to prices and unfriendly service. I would be willing to return if my plate were 8 bucks instead of 14.",

I am not sure if it's good timing on my part but every time I have been to Opa Life there has been live music and good service as well. My wife and I both order pitas to share and have not been let down yet. I also recommend the incredible Greek fries.  On my last trip I tried the Greek coffee which was great and not too bitter and strong like I was expecting. If I have one negative thing to say I would just recommend to actually dine in instead of getting take out. Part of the charm of Opa is the actual decor and music. Without the whole package you will find yourself with pricey take out. To finish I would say great place for coffee or dinner and I am already counting the days until I can go back.",

You order at the counter and the friendly staff delivers your food to your table when it is ready.   I had the chicken pita with a mountain of fries for just $7.95. Unlike many pita places with dried out meat, veggies and old herbs, this was a soft pita with juicy meat, fresh veggies, just the right amount of fresh herbs and a nice tzatziki sauce. The fries were hot and crispy and way more than I could eat.   Parking is close to the door. Super clean and with a desert display that made my mouth water, but my tummy was too full from my pita and fries. Maybe next time. :-)",

    "text": "I came from Hawaii to visit a friend in Arizona. I asked her to please look for a Greek restaurant so I can have some good authentic Greek food since we really don't have much here in Hawaii. She recommended this place Opa life Greek Cafe due to the Yelp ratings and pictures posted. I agreed it looked great and was so excited to finally have some delicious Greek food.  We drove pretty far to get there and when we walked in the door we really didn't get greeted I walked up to the counter and ask if there was a table for 5. And the girl now I know her name Tonya totus there was entertainment and there are no seats available. So I asked her does she know how long it'll be usually most places will tell you a certain amount of time to wait. So basically she was giving us the cold shoulder and made us feel like we should leave so I said okay let's go. Then she said well there are seats in the back. Which kind of upset me due to the fact she said there was nothing available. So she pointed and we walk back there to see what was there. There were two tables. We sat down not knowing how to order being that it was our first time. She walked up to us to get us water and told us you order up at the front by the bar and I'll bring it to your table and gave us menus. So we did that. I was very specific about no onions on the pizza and no papers on the Greek salad. There are no Greeks that eat Capers on a salad. She followed through and repeated the order and then we began to make our drinks. The dr. Pepper was watered down and my friend got water the first cup she was given had a crack in it and water was leaking out so we let Tanya know and she gave us another truck which was worse and water was pouring out the sides. We once again that our waitress time you know and she said she'll get another cup but for us not to pour the ice out because they're short on ice. We sat down waited for her order and when it came about 15-20 minutes later. The tomatoes were yellow green looking very little red Capers all over the salad and the Greek Pizza at onions everywhere. It is a waitresses job to make sure the order is correct before they bring it out. I also mention to her that the water tasted funny so we were going to get different drinks and she came back with a smart-ass remark there's nothing I can do about the water. Any Greek restaurant has very nice people if there Greek and take pride in what they do. The girl beside her also had a nasty attitude she looked great wearing a blue tank top. At this point I was so disgusted and she didn't seem like she wanted to redo the order so I just told her I want a refund. I paid $50.08 and she refunded me $49.83 I told her that's not the amount and she told me she would be short $0.25 in her drawer I couldn't believe what I heard. I think this place needs to shut down or hire new people with better attitudes starting from the very beginning I should have known when she copped an attitude about the seats. I'm so disappointed that this restaurant has the name Greek on it. I will never return and I hope this opens the eyes to others not to go. I can't say if the food is good or not I didn't get to taste it. But the service was absolutely horrific",

    "text": "This review is not just about the food, service, and decor, but the package deal with free music most nights.  I've been here several times and am very impressed with the fresh, updated look from the previous Greek restaurant.  The food is very good, the servers very friendly and efficient.  When I have gone on a night when a band was playing, they seemed to have enough staff to handle taking and delivering orders very well, and the kitchen wasn't overwhelmed.  Also, their pita stays nice and soft, unlike that well-known pita place whose pita dries out hard within 30 minutes.  They have some super bands: jazz, blues, and a mix of others.  It is amazing considering some of them command decent admission costs at other venues and sell out to hundreds.  So the way I look at it, if any of the food seems a little pricey, (and I don't, since you get a lot for your money), then consider it partially for the price of the entertainment, if they are playing while you are there.",

After about 15 minutes we inquired on the status of it. They made it very clear that they forget and said it was almost done. 40 minutes later we got our food.   Now I have worked food service and completely understand accidents happen. But when you forget an order, that order takes priority. We legitimately saw multiple people come in after us, get their food and leave during the time we were waiting. The same delivery driver even came in twice.   After we told them we want our money back they gave us a dessert and a 20% off your next meal voucher. When we got home with our food the order was wrong and my husband and I both felt sick after. We will not be returning.",

Also on the falafel they did not put a lot of hummus on it so a little dry and the pita could have been done a little more a little chewy.

Another positive was that we ordered from Phoenix, which is a pretty good drive from the restaurant itself. The driver from Uber eats I'm sure had a lot to do with it, but the food was still hot and fresh when it got to me. Fries are the bomb diggity! Haven't had fries like that since I lived in PA.

I'm just gonna have to wait a while since I don't often have time to go in and eat. :(",

The menu is excellent, has a huge variety where a lot of Med. restaurants lack. Most notably, they offer an Aegean Club Sandwich which I was tempted to try (check it out!). I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki wrap which I will first say, was UNBELEIVABLE however I was surprised to see the chicken was actually HUGE pieces of Kebab chicken (not complaining) which I expected however to be sliced or chopped chicken. The chicken was seasoned well, matched with hummus great, but one more huge compliment.....Their Tzatziki sauce is PERFECT. Not too thick, not too thin, and tastes wicked fresh. I will definitely go back as the servers there are also as hot as the food and finding out that on Tuesday's they have $1 Gyro tacos !",

The only place it falls short for me personally is the authenticity or exotic flavor of the food. I usually hit up mom and pop type greek places around town, so I've come to expect more of a native taste. I ordered a Gryo and was a little disappointed with the lack of tzatziki, which is, in my opinion, one of the signature flavors of a gyro. If you're looking for a great atmosphere with super friendly service, here ya go! But if you're in the mood for a more traditional greek flavor experience, look else where, like Flaming Kabob.",

    "text": "What a pleasant surprise! This fresh, new, little, somewhat hidden Greek place took over where My Big Fat Greek Express used to be. They've done a nice remodel, opened and brightened the place up and, although I was the only one in the joint when I visited, it looks like it should be a friendly and inviting atmosphere.   The menu includes the usuals; appetizers ($5-15), salads ($9-15), wraps ($9-10) and pitas (~$8), and \"Off The Grill\" plates that include your choice of 2 sides ($10-16), all with your choice of chicken, pork, beef, lamb, shimp, and sandwiches/burgers ($10-12), etc. They have a full coffee bar with what look like reasonable prices, fruit smoothies, and Italian sodas, and a selection of breakfast paninis. There are about 6 beers on tap for $4.50 and 7 or so wines by the glass at $7, and a scrumptious looking list of desserts ranging from $4-$8.   My Chicken Souvlaki plate included 2 generous skewers of chicken that was flavorful, tender and juicy, fries, and rice that was tasty and well cooked, a pita bread and some sauces. Service was friendly from the one woman in the store, who was also clearing up to close, but still attentive, offered me water while I waited for my takeaway food, and took the time to tell me about their lunch special ($6 wraps & pitas from 11-3).   They also offer Happy Hour from 3-7pm with deals on apps, beer and wine.   My 3-star rating is for the food (quality, quantity, speed to produce) and service. The only reason they're not getting 5 stars from me is because I think their prices are a bit too high for the market. I think this may affect them, given their newness, lack of reputation, and somewhat obscure location. Munchies (my go-to place) is serving roughly the same fare for about 30% less, overall, and they're open till the wee hours.    So, I'll check out Opa Life again, and based on my first visit, recommend it, but probably not for a quick weeknight dinner except if you go during lunchtime.",

Decided to get a quick meal for my child and macaroni cheese was the only selection for any pasta type dish on the kid's menu. And with a only a few sides to choose from as an option I reluctantly chose fries. When the food came out, what appeared before me was boxed macaroni on my plate! I was in disbelief. I asked the server, \"Is that Kraft macaroni that they made?\" To which the girl replied,  \"Yeah...well. ..that's how most restaurants make it.\" That made me even more irritated, that she would go as far to say that MOST restaurants use store bought macaroni, as if I was that ignorant! Not to mention, the fries were your standard Ore-ida frozen steak fries. I thought this place was going be authentic and fresh; I was sorely disappointed. I think I was even being on the nice side saying it was Kraft, for all I know it was store brand macaroni. I'm sure this is indicative of how they prepare the rest of their menu, with premade, frozen, out-of-the-box food.",

    "text": "OPA Life Greek Cafe gives me life!  I arranged to meet up with a group of friends on a weekend evening here, not knowing ahead what fun we would have. If you call ahead of time and have at least 10 persons, you can set a reservation, otherwise you'll be at the mercy of whatever free tables are available upon arrival. Luckily they weren't too upset when my group of 10 shrank to 7 at the midnight hour, and we were able to grab 2 big tables next to another. You order from the counter and they bring it out, a very easy process. I was surprised at how quickly my meal came out! They have a big menu headboard above the order counter and handheld menus, with a lot options for breakfast, lunch, & dinner, as well as a full bar.  One of my friends lives nearby and loves coming here. Her go-to is a gyro, but this evening we decided to each go with a Gyro Platter, me with veggies and Greek Fries. Spend the $1 on the fry upgrade! The excess toppings were great with my gyro meat and veggies. Since I worked out right before, I joined the clean plate club. If I hadn't, I don't think I would've been able to- for all the food I ate, it was worth the price! If you have space in your stomach, order the fried ball dessert that comes with ice cream and honey- oh so amazing!!  During the weekends they typically have a live band play music in the corner, so it might a tight squeeze, especially if no one wants to sit outside. During our dinner it was a little loud at times, but we made due, thankfully we were close to the door & not to the band.",

Well...I'd have given them four or five stars but for the very limited gluten-free options. I can understand the pita, but why do they have to serve French fries coated in wheat flour? Choices are limited for us celiacs. Bummer!",

I did not understand the concept of ordering at the bar. There was no spot for me there at first, so I was patiently waiting. After I waited for someone to pay attention to me for like 8 minutes, I could order. I tried simple gyro. I did not see that they add olives to it, so I had to get it as a side. The portion was big that I had leftovers for the next day lunch. The meat was good enough. It came out quick. I also ordered a baklava to go. It was a bit too soft for my taste. I like it more crunchy. Overall, the food was just good, but I could only wish a quicker service. I don't think that I will come back because I've had a better Greek dishes in the town that cheaper and faster.",

Opa Life Cafe has reasonably priced Greek favorites, as well as various pita sandwiches and breakfast. The interior is nice and contemporary, with twinkling lights bordering the large patio outside, and spacious, uncluttered interior. There are 2 TVs here showing various channels and on certain nights they have live music (Jazz). We were here on a Saturday night when they had a live band and it was fairly busy as there was a constant stream of people trickling in to get to-go orders or dine in and enjoy the music.  I tried the grape leaves and roasted garlic hummus. Both were a sizable portion. The grape leaves were filled to the brim with well seasoned meat and rice. The sauce- Hellooo lemon! It was a bit too lemony/acidic for me but overall I enjoyed it. The hummus was smooth and had a creamy texture. I could taste a bit of the garlic but I didn't really like the addition of cumin to the hummus. They included a lot of pita bread to go with it which I appreciated.   Overall I enjoyed both dishes and I'll be back to try more Greek food.",

On music nights, the place gets crowded, so the service is slower but they do their best. This is also a jazz and blues club on weekends: between the food and the music, you won't find a better place for a night out in the East Valley",

The staff is great, they explain everything about the food when asked. It is also very clean in here. Bathrooms as well. I got the food to go and we really liked it. Except for the salad. The Salad was almost $15.00, It was full of spines of the lettuce. You cannot eat that. If you were desperate and that is all there was you could but, not when you are paying that much for a salad. I was extremely disappointed in that fact. The rest of the food was good, but it is really a bummer when this happens. This is just sheer laziness, to add this into the salad.  Other than that the food was great and on the weekends they have live music and such.  The Lamb Souvlaki was great!  If you are unfamiliar with the area ,you really have to search. It is on the south side of the road and hidden among a few other shops and restaurants. You can park and walk a little if you have too. It is in the middle of the complex.",

The latter was the case last week when I checked Yelp first and found what looked like a solid Greek Cafe located close to a business my husband and I were heading to for a meeting.  Unfortunately, OPA Life Greek Cafe did not live up to it's four star rating.  The overall experience was not good...  We ordered to Greek Salads with Chicken and a hummus appetizer.  We found the prices to be very expensive considering the poor quality of the food we received.  The chicken in the salads was rubbery.  The hummus was bland and a weird texture.  The dressings tasted like they were store bought and filled with chemicals.    The girls working were friendly, and I like restaurants like this with a fast casual environment, but I like them a lot more when the food tastes good and the price reflects the quality... I will not be back.  So sorry OPA!",

Only plus left is the food portions, you can feed two people with one gyro plate which makes the higher price (compared to other gyro places) worth it.",

Her consistent professionalism shines through in all areas of restaurant service.  She remembers your drink, favorite foods and makes you feel like she has been waiting for you to return.  I often tell her she could make it big as a top model.  That said, the food is fresh, every item authentic Greek.  Faves are, the watermelon salad, lemon chicken rice soup kotosoupa, Grecian delight pizza, lamb souvlaki, Opa Life combo,  and homemade pita and hummus. Prices are reasonable, makes it affordable for ASU students to retirees (like me).   I often schedule in a few nights a month for the no cover live music.  Opa has a diverse group of outstanding musicians brought in by Doc.  And be sure to order the \"baklava cheesecake\" before you leave. If you go, be sure to tell Georgia, Linda sent you ; )",

I wrote a Yelp! review about the Westgate location recently and they also earned five stars for the service and excellent food. I also mentioned that I would seek their east side location. And I found it... By accident.  While doing business in Tempe this past week, I heard there was an Opa Life in the area. Then I realized I was on Baseline and it was close by. It was literally in the same parking lot. This was a fortunate coincidence since my girlfriend and I have decided to make a conscious effort to eat better. Plus we both really enjoy Greek food!  If it was possible to give more than five stars, I would. The extra star would be for the character of the architecture and decor. They also feature live music every night (except Tuesdays when we were there).  Not only is Opa Life consistently delicious, it's healthy and the plating is obviously important to the folks in the kitchen. And everything is always fresh and colorful. Kudos to the woman on the register who recommended the Jalapeno Hummus!  When you're craving some amazing Greek/Mediterranean cuisine, whether you're in the west or east valley, it's nice to know one of these two options is close. Thanks!",

Their pizzas are amazing as well, try going on a Monday though when they are half off they are a little expensive, but worth it in my opinion. Cheesecake and chocolate cake are really good as well if you need something sweet!",

Food: Greek fare is super tasty. The pizzas are delicious, and the platters are flavourful and filling. There's a variety of wine and beer. The meats can be slightly dry at times, but it's still good.   The best item by far is the baklava cheesecake. Do you like baklava? Honey? Walnuts? Cheesecake? Magic dust? (cinnamon?) If so, get this. It is incredible. Bring a friend or two to share though, because this dense culinary delight is sure to leave you full.   Atmosphere: how cool is live music and dancing? I haven't figured out their schedule for music yet, but you're sure to hear some rocking beats on weekend nights and certain weekdays. Jazz and Latin beats can be heard throughout the night.   Service: you order at the front and they bring it to where you're seating. Be prepared to get there early if you want a table inside.",

First timer at Opa and it was one of the best meals I've had in the valley!!!  Shrimp skewer, saganaki, a gyro and greek fries were the perfect combo from the appetizer / A la cart menu. Everything is priced well, I've worked in restaurants from Boston to LA; the amount of food the the price is solid.  Everything tasted amazing, lots of flavor in the meats. I almost forgot I had tatziki sauce for the gyro I liked eating it by itself!! The wonderful young woman behind the counter was so nice and when I asked about different food items she explained perfectly.  It was Saturday 2/16/19 and I forgot her name (I keep thinking Sadie but I know that's not right, I'm sorry girl you were amazing I should've wrote down your name!) but she was super sweet and answered all of our questions. I'll be coming in AT LEAST once a week from now on, this place is now my comfort food!! If I could give 10 stars I would, no joke.",

    "text": "Just visited here for the first time last week and overall it was pretty enjoyable. The food was great, I ordered a gyro with their seasoned fries, and apparently they offer $1.00 street tacos for taco tuesday - I ordered the gyro verson. The atmosphere was nice, nothing too crazy or busy, and it was nice to see that they offer live local music on a regular basis.  The only reason this place gets a 4/5 instead of a 5 is because the service was neither fast nor friendly. The food came out  quick enough, and there was plenty of it, but the ordering process was a bit of a mess. The cashier had called us over to take our order and as we walked up to her register she decided to take a long phone order. From there, she disappeared off to speak with another staff member. When she did get around to taking our order and I ordered the $5.99 lunch combo, she neglected to mention the fact that the lunch combo was no longer a deal they were offering, thus doubling the cost of my meal. She then had trouble figuring out why my friend and I were confused about the pricing, so she clearly was either very new or just doesn't pay attention to what's going on in her workspace, as there was literally a sign behind her head that read \"$5.99 lunch combo.\"  Regardless, the manner in which the whole thing went down was more than a little irritating, as she wasn't very polite to begin with.  Aside from that though, the food was great and it seems like a great place to see some live music! Like I said, questionable service, but since you deal with cashiers rather than servers, it's an easier pill to swallow, as you don't have to continually interact with the employees.",

I was also charged for a meal that I did not receive, my Gyro was supposed to come with fries, and I just got a $9 Gyro. I had taken my food to go, so my mistake there. The Gyro came with cheesy shredded lettuce, diced tomato, and poorly cut red onions for the prices they charge here.

I decided to try them out and placed an order to go, 20 minutes later after I saw people who came in after receiving food and I was still waiting and losing time to eat before I had to start work again. I went up and asked what was going on and all I heard was sorry from the server not even the cook, or the person that took my order just the random server... From the time I complained my order it took them 3-4 minutes to get it in a bag and have me on my way. So they basically wasted almost half my lunch break because of unorganized individuals who didn't seem to care. The food was ok bit expensive, 1 chicken gyro and side salad was a little under 9 bucks. I prefer Pita Shack since it's better tasting and more cost effective AND they don't forget about my order and make me wait over 20 minutes for a chicken gyro and salad... I have them 2 stars because the server was really apologetic but I will not be going back.",

    "text": "I went there for one reason, the music. I had been very happy to find a venue with jazz in the area. When the opportunity finally came to visit, it was extremely disappointing.. This is no music venue. The band is tucked into one corner of an L shaped restaurant, meaning at least half the restaurant cannot see them. The ambiance of the restaurant is a step-up from fast food but not much. There was a great deal of noise coming from people talking, coming in, going out, ordering, etc. This is ridiculous if you are a music fan. Also, no table waitress service, you have to go up to the counter to order, not only for food but drinks as well. Talk about a mood buster! Bright lighting as well destroys any possible atmosphere. For nights when they have music, there should be table service. Someone there needs to put their thinking cap on! Finally, the food - I didn't have any Greek food items because I wasn't familiar with them so a hamburger was ordered instead. It was like ground lead. Dry, dense, with no flavor at all; it must have been sitting there for hours before I came along. The Music is a good idea but now they have to change a few things. One, table service; two; put the band in the middle not hidden in the corner so only a limited number of people can see them;  three, Have people enter at the ends of the restaurant, this would free up space for more tables in the middle; Four, can the noise. Either become a restaurant where jazz is displayed or install a jukebox.",

I was pleasantly surprised that the place looked clean and modern considering some of the other places in the same area (not say to say that those are bad places).  I was instantly disappointed with the menu prices since I was expecting more of a $10 or less ala cart type meal since I am on a budget. i settled for the special they had listed for $9.95 with a picture, but then was disappointed that to get the pictured item I would have to pay a dollar more. The meal I got was a gyro, greek fries, and a drink. The presentation was above average and pleasant,and the food was good. The greek fries were very good and the gyro was pretty good as well. The food seemed very american with a greek flavor when I was looking to settle for the opposite (another disappointment). There were others around me who ordered dishes that look very delicious, but I am sure that that they cost of those meals was higher than mine as well. I would probably go back with reservation, but it wouldn't be my first choice. As we were leaving around 7pm on a Friday night, it appeared that a jazz quartet was setting up for entertainment.",

The stuff have excellent helpful skills and very knowledgeable on what they have on the menus. The male workers here are very clean. They do not waste any time standing around, they will clean tables, chairs, booths and windows once they see it dirty.  They totally keep busy when they are not in rush hours.  They will find something to do and clean.  You can tell they have a good management to keep up with them as you can see they are happy employees. You can see it in them, that they love working at this restaurant and they stand by their establishment.  They have great variety on beers on tap and you can ask for a sample taste as well. The environment here is very cozy and makes you feel welcomed.  They seemed to have a great line up for their entertainment, it's posted on every table along with their happy hour menus.  I would like to thank, Isaac for providing an excellent customer service. Keep smiling and the positive attitude does makes peoples day and it will always be remembered, because customer do come back not just for food, but also because of someone like you!  Thank you.",

We used to go all the time and the last time there we placed our order and waited ... only to be told they basically had nothing we ordered and were told that maybe bc we came during hour, that's why they were out of everything! The staff was very unapologetic and it took me speaking to the manager to be heard, but clearly didn't matter.  I barely returned today after about 6 wks, and was disappointed. The size portions are way smaller and the food quality was mediocre. The same staff still was not very friendly as my last visit. I'm really sad as this was our go-to place and I don't think I'll be returning :( My former review is below .....  Love this place! I'm a local so it's super convenient, fast and fresh!

I got the Chicken Souvlaki off the grill and chose Greek salad and Greek fries as my sides, feeling super Greek. When I arrived, my order was ready to go.   I couldn't wait and tried a fry on my way back to work. Omg...so good. It was crispy, coated with feta and parmesan cheese and packed with flavor. I got to fully enjoy them along with the large portion of chicken (two skewers) pita bread, salad, and dressing. I also got a side of salty kalamata olives for $1. I didn't really like the lemon dijon sauce on the chicken and fries but it wasn't too strong. Overall there was a large amount of food for the price because I had lunch the next day and it was still pretty good.",

First off the chicken was super dry and had no flavor and the salad barely had any dressing on it I actually had to put salt on my salad which I've never done before if it wasn't for the feta cheese the whole salad I probably would've gave back. I'm gonna stick with my favorite place which is King of gyros For the cost and the flavor and the portions there are hands-down by far the best so far  Well you do have ppl walking around in any other restaurant they would stop and ask how everything is",

I misread that menu thinking that two sides were allowed with the  algean club and wondered why I was charged almost $4 for a Greek side salad when I asked for rice and fries.  I didn't get fries so I called to ask why and they explained I don't get two sides with my dish and I could already tell in the man's tone of voice he wasn't going to rectify the fact that they gave me a salad instead of fries anyways.  by the way I looked up the menu after the phone conversation and a salad is included with the sandwich so if anything I should have been charged for a side of rice for 2.95.  The gyro meat was rubbery and cold and bland. The Greek dressing was sour and off-putting. This was hands down the worst $30 I've spent in a while on two meals. Argued with my husband over returning the food for a refund but he didn't seem to want to go through the trouble. I guess he doesn't want to be \"that guy.\"  Would not return. Giving my husband the stink-eye for the rest of the night.",

    "text": "Wow!  A total disappointment. I was here three weeks ago and was so happy with the horiatiki that posted on Facebook and told all my friends.  What they served today was pathetic.  When it came out there was nothing feta!  At all.  The nice young man at the counter went into the kitchen and brought back a small stingy amount. Some of the vegetables were cut so small I'd call them minced. The gyros meat was cold and seemed like it had been sitting out all afternoon.  Soooo d  6/20/19 iwas really impressed that the owner reached out to me about a bad experience and invited me back. That's the type of business I like to  deal with    I made arrangements to meet a client there today. My client called while I was waiting at a table saying he was running late. I took a moment to explain to the girl at the counter about my last experience and the vegetables being fit for garnishing a taco. She said \"I think that's the way they're supposed to be\". I chuckled and explained it wasn't. I told her my lunch guest was running late and asked if I could sit at a table. She said yes.  I asked if I could have an ice tea while waiting and she told me I have to give her a credit card!  I chuckled and asked if she was serious. I was wearing business attire and did not look like some tweaked that would run out on a $3 iced tea and said I would be ordering food in a bit and would pay for everything then. She refused to give me a tea.  Sad. I won't be going back. Two poor experiences in a row. Such a bummer since the first time was so positive. Seems likely like lack of training for cooks and counter staff will sink this business.",

HOWEVER, they recently added more beer taps, extended the bar, and reconfigured the tables and band set up (which is less than ideal). Friend and I went in for happy hour about 2 weeks ago. We each ordered a Dos Equis and a pizza. The beer was lukewarm at best. When our pizza arrived, we told the server Jessica. She said \"I can put it in a cold glass next time\". We ordered a different beer and it was better. When we checked out, I asked to speak to the manager. Jessica said \"Larissa is the manager, and she was here standing behind you. She heard what you said about the warm beer\". Hmmmm. So she couldn't be bothered to speak to us about this issue? So, next day I started calling Jerry, the owner. I called every day for almost a week. I left voice messages for him to call me. Then I emailed him. Still have heard a peep from him. I am beyond upset that he AND the manager couldn't be bothered to address this issue. On a happier note, Georgia is a bartender on the weekends, and she is AMAZING! I've been in since this incident, and they have been out of a number of the new beers. So, why add all these new beers if they aren't available? I am saddened to know that they really don't care about customer service.",

    "text": "Dropped by for lunch and Opa satisfied me with amazing  food, an incredibly friendly staff with quick service in a comfy and clean environment. I ended up ordering the Chicken Pesto Pita with side salad and my friend had the gyro pita sandwich with salad. The pesto sauce is simply awesome! Very flavorful and not at all oily (I prefer a thicker pesto). The pita bread was fresh and soft and the chicken cooked perfectly. As for the side salad ... It was a meal in itself! So good and so fresh. Tons of cucumbers, tomatoes, feta and divine dressing! The gyro was just as tasty and their iced tea blends are delicious. All of this for under $10 each! We will definitely be back .... I am determined to try the club pita.... I hear it's to die for and big enough to feed two!",

We enjoyed a scrumptious calamari-topped green salad and classic gyro pita. Great beer on tap. Owner's kids were sitting adjacent enjoying an envy-inducing ice cream treat. Big TVs had college bowl games; regulars at the bar; great local atmosphere. Very friendly staff.",

This by far was the most top notch experience I have had in my 6 years of living away from my family.   I decided to look on their menu at home as they just opened down the street from me, and was delighted by their selection. When my boyfriend and I walked in the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the girl behind the counter. She asked if we had been in before and upon us answering no, went through all the specials. I ordered the OPAtizer combo, and he ordered the gyro pita with greek fries. The portions were incredible, we definitely took leftovers home!   The food was delicious, and we were checked on several times. All of our needs were catered to, and we even managed to find some room to enjoy a very authentic galektobouriko (greek custard with phyllo dough)   We even noticed the back of the waitress's shirt said koukla, which means doll in Greek. All in all a top-notch choice that I would recommend to anyone.",

The food was spectacular and leaps and beyond better in terms of quality than BFGE. The price point matches the quality of food, along with the area. Please take the time to read every review thoroughly rather than view the rating. Most people ranked this place harshly low for minor inconveniences including price comparisons to BFGE, which had inferior food. Either way, give this place a chance.",

The desire for healthier, quick and different brought us here. The 80's rock music playing on the patio pulled us in and the ambience, friendly staff and fantastic food blew us away. I'm a picky eater and there wasn't one thing left on  my plate! We started with the Combo appetizer then split a caprese salad and chicken wrap with greek fries. The portions were large but apparently, we were hungry! (Plus, it was pretty tough to settle on just one platter when they all sounded delicious.)  Okay, stop reading and go enjoy it for yourself!

    "text": "Loving Greek food as much as I do I returned to give this new venue a second shot.  While the environment is GREAT for working, free wifi music (80's Rock that day) and spacious, the food doesn't cut it.  I ordered a basic greek salad, my friend a gyros and we had a hummus appetizer.    The first hummus tasted spoiled, the kind when you put it in your mouth it fizzes.  I eat hummus almost daily and I'm hard to please but fresh is key.  They did replace it with no hassle but it didn't start things well.  For the high prices it was a lackluster salad,  lettuce unassuming, unripe tomatoes and dressing that tasted like it was from a bottle.  For the price I expected a much higher quality salad, not a cheap diner salad.  The gyros plate was just as unimpressive.  Second visit the staff was pretty and either brand new and didn't know anything or not well trained.  We got what we needed but service could overlook the high prices and so-so quality.    I'm vegan so I can't eat much else, but if you want a quick meal, a place to work it's good.  And they just opened so much of this may work out!!  I will have to be REALLY hungry to go again but would have a meeting here.",

The main thing that killed the entire experience was that we arrived at 8pm (their hours are 6am to 9pm) and by 8:20, when we went for a refill, they had shut the entire soda machine down and were stacking chairs. When we wanted a refill they had to actually put they nozzles back on the soda machine to allow us to get a refill.  I think you need to at least stay open the hours posted on your door, and not rush the people who just paid to eat at your restaurant out the door. We were the only people eating when we went, and although the server was friendly, you need to stay open the hours you say you will. No one wants to eat while the place is being shut down. If you want to close early, you need to say so.",

    "text": "So Opa Life has taken over the space formally occupied by My Big Fat Greek Express as apparently the parent company of Opa Life bought out MBFGE per my conversation with the woman working the counter who is apparently from corporate helping launch the store.  The first thing I noticed here was that they did a really nice job renovating the old space that was dingy and tired space. This is nice and refreshing.  Sadly the second thing I noticed was the sticker shock of this place compared to MBFGE which was pretty reasonable. I think they are up a couple bucks up across the board.  I got the special which was a combo deal of chicken pita, drink and a side for $9. The food was fine but lacking flavor. The flavors were pretty blank on the pita it was pretty much red onion and taziki for taste the chicken was band and over cooked.  They just opened so I will give them a bit and try again and see if it's any different but with Pita Shack closer to me and I think a bit more flavor it will be hard to convince myself to come this way often.",

I asked them to hold the apples on mine, and it came out perfect.  Had to try a bit of the strawberry, to because it looked so good (maybe next time I will get that!!).  I used to come to the old dirty express, but even though the food was great the place was nasty.  Now this place is like brand new.  I couldnt even belive it was the same place!!!    I will be back to sit on the patio with a glass of wine and for some people watching and a humus plate.  The owner was so friendly and gave me a ticket to have a coffee on him next time i come.  Only complaint, I would rather have a burger on him next time I come!!",

It actually looked good, but 30 minutes after placing my order, I went back up to check on it. After about five minutes, it was determined that my order was given to someone else. No worries.  I said I'll wait. But literally 30 minutes later I still had no food. I checked again. It had been ready for awhile but the girl I was working with just didn't care to follow up on an already bad situation. At that point, I asked for a refund and was coldly taken care of. No offer of any way of making up for the 1hour plus, I waisted sitting there being ignored. Bad,  bad customer service. That girl should not be serving anyone.",

They make them crispy so fries don't end up soggy. I had my steak medium well and it came out perfect, full of flavor. The salad was ok. Besides the regular fountain drinks, they have a couple options of really good brewed teas and different coffees.   I haven't tried the desserts but they look really good and I have heard good things. Certain evenings they had live music. The atmosphere is very welcoming. They also have an outside seating area with a heater for the chilly nights. The only thing I have to say is prices are a little pricey. Overall I would recommend this place!!",

But the taste was awesome and the portions were generous. I brought half of my Aegean Club home for my stepson. My wife had lamb souvlaki medium rare and said everything was wonderful.

Well we ordered the hummus trio, Greek coffee and Baklava. We chose Garlic roasted, sun-dried tomatoes and bell peppers for Hummus. Must say they all tasted really good. Sun-dried tomatoes had a great flavor. I remove a star for the quantities of the pita given. There was so much of hummus on plate with hardly any pita. It was my first time trying Greek coffee it was surely a good attempt, had good cinnamon savor. I remove a star for the Baklava, it was not what i expected. I felt it was not fresh enough, the layers were sticky and it was way too sweet. I would still go to Haji Baba for Baklava.   Overall it was an ok experience as for the food is concerned. Price range is on the higher side compared to other cafes. Service was really good which was impressive. Place is calm and cozy for a good date.",

Not a popular move as we, plus friends/family, always made it a point to spend the evening there (2-3 hours), eating/drinking/spending money as we listened to the band. We will (obviously) not be going to Opa Life if ST are not performing and possibly not for other bands. We WILL, however, be going to the venue where ST end up playing.

Everything tasted clean and fresh, but the tzaziki sauce on the gyro greatly lacked flavor, as well as the chicken. The fries were basic as well. I would try it again if I was in the area and see if the salads or maybe pizza are better.",

    "text": "Had the gyro and fries. They gyro was very good, overflowing the pita with meat. The veggies were fresh, the sauce tangy. Good sandwich. The fries were good, just not my style -- those battered fries. Coke machine was a bit foamy. Napkins are scarce -- kept at bar/soda machine, not tables.  Lot's of TVs and good beer on tap. The place has a good vibe.   The staff was really friendly, not too talkative, and quick. Awesome (unlike Hertz for sure).  I'll be back.",

I ordered the caprese pita that one of the managers recommended, and it was to die for! There are so many options, you can't go wrong coming here!",
