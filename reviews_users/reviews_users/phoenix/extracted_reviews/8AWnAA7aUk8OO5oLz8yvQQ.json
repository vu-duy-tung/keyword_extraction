Door to enter restaurant was left open, probably for servers dealing with patrons sitting outside, but it got pretty chilly in there. I asked for crepes and a few strawberries added on top cost $2.00 extra. Also, 16 oz OJ was $5.00. Other than that, the atmosphere was nice. Tables were not too close together and Food arrived hot and on a timely manner. I would probably go there again, but only if it's just me and my hubby...too expensive for our budget when you take a large group.",

Their cold brew is REALLY good. Loved their hash browns and they even ask if you want them extra crispy! (This isn't Denny's, their normal cooked hash is good enough to me). The vibe, location, and dining layout was great. They have a tight patio area but it's really nice. SERVICE WAS GREAT, THANK YOU RALF! We'll be returning :)",

My friend and I were immediately seated. The menu has plenty of options to choose from, almost makes it hard to narrow down. I chose the Ole omelet and a classic waffle. My friend chose the corn beef hash with eggs and potatoes. Our server was prompt and efficient and always made sure we were okay. Overall, great new place to come check out if you're in the central Phoenix area.",

I ordered the Benedict with hollandaise sauce on the side and I will say, the hollandaise sauce had a nice lemony flavor. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles which he ate, but wasn't overly impressed with. The chicken was a little dry and lacked seasoning.  I returned with my daughter this past Saturday and the service was lacking. I was quickly greeted and my coffee with almond milk was served right away, which was nice. After that, it just went down hill. Our server didn't come around for a while, the door was left open so it was cold and I just felt like we were forgotten about. When our server did approach the table, she seemed rush and she didn't take the order down correctly. I caught the first mistake, but she didn't offer different sides or to bring me water and then I never saw her again. Another person brought our food, which was delivered quickly, but he didn't introduce himself and I don't think we were his table. I ordered the avocado wrap with bacon, but it didn't come with bacon. In addition, the wrap just wasn't that good. It lacked salt and pepper and it came with hasbrowns, which were too greasy to eat plus it wasn't the side I wanted when ordering a whole wheat wrap.  This place is super close to my house and I want to like it so I'll be back again. Hopefully, it was a bad day and it will wow me the next time.",

The food is amazing, and reasonably priced. The experience was even more amazing because Rafael waited on us! He was  very attentive, efficient, and ensured we had everything we needed. It is so refreshing to get such wonderful treatment when the restaurant was at full capacity!  I sure wish you would open an Elly's in Carrollton (Dallas), Texas!  And have Rafael be there too!

He literally told us AND recommended us that if we want specialty drinks that he knew of a good bar called undertow where they can make our drinks \"special\" and my friend didn't end up ordering one because he insisted this wasn't a place to do that. Didn't think it was hard to make a margarita with out adding Prosecco that's actually one less step to do!  On top of that he barely came by. If he did, it took him 20 mins to come back for drinks checks etc.  decent food, BAD service.",

Everything starts with coffee. Most restaurants have weak tasteless coffee - NOT ELLY's.  It was delicious and favorable. A great beginning to a delicious meal.  My husband and I had an omelet. The omelet we ordered had avocados. Usually you get a small amount of avocado - this time AVOCADO In every bite.    Breakfast was delicious - coffee was refreshingly strong and the best part of all - they turned down the music. We got to eat in peace. Our server was appropriately attentive.   What started as an accident ended up huge treat.",

Great menu options, but the frittata has way too many hash browns, my friend ordered an egg white omelette and got a regular omelette and they charged me twice for my entire bill - then told me they messed up. Service was just okay. They do have an amazing raspberry sorbet mimosa though, that was the highlight.",

This was our first time here, so I asked our server Ashley what was her recommendations. She was very thorough going through the menu and gave us her favorites.   We had the Ole Omelette with pancakes and hash browns. Chorizo Omelette was prepared very well not to spicy with the jalapenos on the side, hash browns crispy but a little on the cold side. The pancakes were good but pretty simple.   Corn Beef Hash with Sourdough toast was pretty good, the corn beef hash was mixed together with fried onions and hash browns topped with eggs.  As we arrived,  we were given the choice to eat inside or outside. With the temperature forecasted at 105 degrees that was an easy decision. Dined on a Wednesday afternoon around 1:30 and there were a hand full of tables being used so we chose a booth and enjoyed our meal and took our time.  We liked our meal and look to come back another time",

So for 30 minutes after they've taken your order you just sit there unproductive getting hangrier by the minute. I would've appreciated if they weren't so quick to seat you but make sure you get quick service as soon as you're seated. This place is huge that I think their kitchen is too small to spit out food fast enough or a reasonable amount of time for a restaurant this big. Either that or they don't have enough kitchen staff. I don't know but something's broken here. A step in the process needs to be crashed in order to get food served a little faster. By the time our food came out it's already lunch, so yeah nope not coming back. The poached egg came out like a soft boiled egg. I didn't care how the food tasted because their shitty service already left a bad taste in my mouth.",

This can be a deal breaker here in metro Phx. Step it up, Elly's and you'll have 5 stars.",

However, the service made the experience not that great. The host was the most helpful person there! He sat us quickly, got us our drinks and when we had been waiting for 20 minutes for our waiter to come he took it upon himself to get our order because he noticed we had been waiting a long time. When our waiter finally showed up there was no greeting, no apology for taking forever, just dropped off our food and walked away. Didn't check back with us if we needed anything and then magically appeared later on with the check and wasted no time taking our bill. I understand being very busy as the restaurant certainly was but a little courtesy to your customers when you make them wait goes a long way. If it weren't for the host taking care of us while doing his very busy job of seating the large number of people coming in, we would have gotten up and walked out.",

The strawberry was sliced up and there could not have been two whole strawberries.  I counted 2 pecans and a couple of pieces of pecans.  Seriously!   The oats were mushy, overcooked and watery.  I was very disappointed.  The place was clean and tidy, attractive.  Music too loud.   Sorry, I'll probably not return.  Flower Child down the parking lot has AMAZING avocado toast with perfectly cooked poached (my choice) eggs.  First watch down the street has one of the best breakfast menus in all of Phx.

We ordered omelets, scrambles and pancakes and everything tasted fresh and fantastic.  The service was friendly and efficient and the prices were very reasonable.  We will definitely be back in the near future to try some of their lunch menu items.",

Then the issue arose when I asked for a different jelly, because I'm allergic to strawberries and it was strawberry jelly. He said they have another and will be back.  A solid 10 minutes later, our server comes back with no jelly and says they dont have any other flavors. Ok, no problem. I asked for a French toast instead. So, 15 minutes later he comes back WITHOUT the French toast and says that he doesnt know what is taking so long with the French toast. I told him basically at this point, I'm done. So A) I had terrible service and B) I didnt have half of my entree that I wanted. So I left the guy $1 tip on a 18 tab, because the service was so terrible.   I checked my bank and this guy gave himself an extra $1. He stole money from me. I will be calling and seeing how the restaurant handles this. Most likely I will not be returning either, I dont want my money stolen from me anymore.",

It has great flavor with the only down side of way too many hashbrowns (more than half the pan and they were a little greasy) under the streak (tender), mushroom, cheese and eggs. I did enjoy the Fredo Coffee.   My son had the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon.  He really enjoyed his food.  Especially the Macha drink.     A friend ordered gluten free pancakes and he loved it.  He said they were light and fluffy.  He could tell they were gluten free.   Reason for 4 stars... we were a table of nine but is should not have taken 2.5 hrs to order eat and pay.  Seemed like it took forever to order our drinks and pay after our meal.  The water taste like tap water...no bueno.  Too much hashbrowns on the skillet plates.  Since it is in a dish, the grease just settled at the bottom.",

The restaurant is very spacious which was smart for a breakfast spot on busy days like today (Sunday). There were 2 of us and were initially told the wait would be about 15 mins, but we were sat within 5  Our server was Rafael and he was amazing! Very friendly, fast, and efficient.   I ordered the avocado wrap with bacon. I really liked  the way the scrambled eggs were cooked, light and fluffy. Bacon was an additional charge of $2 and I wish were was a little more of it. Maybe a little more salt or spice of some kind. It was best when I added Cholula  My husband had the Ole skillet and he enjoyed it but also wished there was more meat. (He said if he would've known how little meat there was, he would have ordered a side of bacon)  All in all, service was great & food came out fast and was enjoyable. Maybe be a little more generous with portion of meat in entrees",

    "text": "Not gonna lie, my brunch companion and I actually laughed about someone else's Yelp review while we were eating our delicious food. You see, they chose this brunch spot after looking at reviews and our experience was a mirror image of one. We were seated immediately (by the time we left there was a line outside) with Mikaylah, mentioned in another review, and she did not give us her name. Oddly enough, we didn't get our feelings hurt about it. She smiled, she was friendly, she brought my cappuccino quickly.   At this point I had not made a decision from the extensive menu and asked for more time. My companion, having read that the waitress might not come back quickly, got snappy with me. Don't play with me before I drink my coffee. I don't like eggs, so ordering brunch is my least favorite part of the ritual. Mikaylah (who we didn't yet know was Mikaylah and did not find out until we received our bill) came back TWICE checking on my decision status. I'm just saying the previous reviewer might not send as clear a signals as they believe. Maybe. I've never met them.   When I ordered a side of carbs to go with my carbs, Mikaylah cheered me on. When I built my own delicious bacon waffle because it reminds me of one I love in Vancouver, Mikaylah approved. She was just attentive enough without being annoying, and both the coffee and food were excellent. Like you can drink this coffee black even if you've lived in the Seattle metro area for twenty years type excellent.   I'll admit, I annoyed the crap out of the lady at the next table. I laughed a lot during brunch, and apparently laughter is uncouth. I don't agree, and never saw the sourpuss smile. But despite the crabby lady at the next table, even most of the patrons were nice. One lady had a colorful pinata and we shared a smile over that morning sunshine.   If you like eggs, my companion found the omelette delicious. If you hate eggs, there are plenty of carbs to keep you fat and happy. But don't hate on Mikaylah. She's got a great smile, a great attitude, and deserves better than entitled nonsense. Let the woman work. She's amazing. Will be back as soon as I recover from this carb coma. Five stars.",

Went again April 30 and learned they now mixed the Maple syrup with corn syrup.  We could tell right away - very viscous like corn syrup and a poor taste. It would have been a real shame to pour corn syrup on those excellent buckwheat and buttermilk pancakes. Fortunately we asked and they told us about the corn syrup. So we asked for honey also which they provided. Honey on those fine flapjacks was a disappointment, but at least we avoided the dreaded corn syrup.  The rest of the menu is great, and large portions too.  However I'm trying to get past the fake syrup thing. I find it to be a serious deficiency, especially for a place that prides itself on great pancakes, waffles, and french toast.  My advice?  Bring your own real maple syrup or go to Snooze which serves real Maple syrup. They are on Camelback about a mile or so to the east.",

This restaurant really feels like a \"neighborhood hang-out\". The best part of Elly's is that they have an expansive breakfast menu with food that tastes home-cooked. Manager Michael and Wait-Staf Jen make the place feel like you're personal friends with the owner. The other employees seem to genuinely enjoy it there as well. I'd highly recommend this place. It's a little hidden in the Courtyard area of Uptown Plaza on the corner of Camelback and Central (next to AJ's) but well worth the find!",

Lastly tried their very large bacon avocado omellette.  All meals were generous in size.  The restaurant is relatively quiet and the floor to ceiling glass makes it nice and bright.

    "text": "I waited until my second visit before reviewing because my first trip was opening weekend and I thought they would be working out the kinks. Getting a table is a nightmare. I expect a wait; it's Phoenix and that's just how it goes. What I don't expect is an hour and counting wait on a 20 - 25 estimate. There is also the issue of no real waiting area so people tend to wander and when they do call names it's right in front, so walk away at your own peril. They need to text or have pagers to cut down on the insanity. It's loud. When you have a place packed to the gills do you really need to play loud music in the background?  This just adds to the chaos. A breakfast/brunch spot should be relaxing, not blood pressure raising. It's open and bright as seems to be the trendy thing. The food is good but not nirvanic. The servers are pleasant but the service is awful. There shouldn't be 15 to 20 plates on the pass waiting to go out. The Cook's push food out and it just sits there while the expectant diners are forced to watch it from afar.  Then when the food finally does move of the pass, it shouldn't repeatedly be delivered to tables and then taken back because it's not the right order.  This place should be so much more but it feels like the owner has little to no restaurant management experience based on the processes and doesn't seem to know what to do to improve things. Go somewhere else until they get their act together. The are too many other places out there to put yourself through Elly's.",

I love corned beef hash so I ordered that with pancakes.  Honestly, disappointed with the hash.  Visually it would have been more appealing if the plate was garnished with some chopped chives and/or a slice of orange. The hash was crispier (edges were almost black like it was burned) and a little greasier than I like, but I was surprised that it didn't have a strong corned beef flavor.  I could see bits of meat in there but it didn't have the distinct flavor I have had in other corned beef hashes.  The eggs on top were poached  nicely but were small in size.  The pancakes were good. The server said the syrup that accompanied the pancakes was maple syrup - it tasted good but was very thin.  My friend had an omelet which he said was \"\"OK\"  and commented on the plain plating. Overall, value for portion sizes was just average. I will give the place a second chance but won't be ordering the hash again.",

I appreciate his consideration in wanting to make things right. I think it's great that the GM of this establishment is so involved in the Yelp community and really appreciates the feedback, that hopefully we'll be able to come in another day to see the progress Elly's has made. Starting/Grand openings can be tricky to staff, while everyone is still adjusting to the flow, but my first impression is that Elly's could really become something special. While we didn't have the ability to eat due to long wait times, we will be back. I encourage everyone to go check out this eclectic yet modern eatery in Phoenix if you're looking for something new. The menu looked nice and the patrons seemed to be enjoying their food. Looking forward to brunch another weekend!",

We were all very disappointed in both the food and the service. It took an hour to get our food.  My sister and I both ordered a medium rare cheeseburger that came out well done and dry. The burgers had no sauce, and were mediocre. My mother ordered pancakes, and they were rather dense and tasteless.  We agreed that none of us will be returning to this restaurant.",

Let me just say first the food is solid, very good and can tell it's good quality. But I think they still need to work some things out, half the restaurant was empty, there was a line out the door of people waiting and they still weren't seating people. I understand if you are still a little under staffed but heck at least sit them, allow a drink and just say we are a little behind...which I think would have been understood, but don't tell people 10 minutes, ends up being an hour with half the tables being empty. Also saw some of the wait staff not being so clean conscious, like touching food on the line, refilling water bottles with half gone water from other bottles that were at people's tables, and having gone to culinary school and having a food/safety manager certification I might have cringed a few times. Ultimately I will probably try it again, but will probably wait a few more weeks until I do.",

My first thumbs down is they should have dedicated wheel chair tables in the front of the restaurant, so you don't have to navigate the entire place on four wheels. The food was ok, not much flavor except for the salt and pepper I added. And last I know it is seems to be the trend now, but the noise level is way to loud.  You should not have to yell across the table to have a conversation with you fellow guests.",

Instead, my daughter and I walked in and ordered from the 'bar'. I got the Freddo (if you like iced coffee, you'll like this). She got a lemonade and an oatmeal raisin cookie. We also got a ham/cheese croissant. She said the cookie was the best she ever had - 'squishy on the inside and a little crispy on the outside'. The croissant was amazing. It was great to walk into a cute, comfortable brunch place and enjoy a bite to eat and a coffee without having someone wait on you. Instead we just seated ourselves outside with the food/drinks we got from the bar, and then left when we were done. It's the kind of place you could have a big hearty meal with the family, a quick snack, or bring your laptop and get some work done over coffee and a pastry. Oh, and while I was taking a picture of my Freddo (it was so pretty!), two tables inside were taking pictures of their food. That's always a good sign.",

    "text": "First the waiter did the best he could. But for some reason they won't allow any substitutions. So when one of our party asked for a low carb option other than the hash browns he was told he could not substitute. He asked if he could just have some fruit (still healthier than hash browns. And was told no, unless he wanted to pay the extra few bucks for a side of fruit. Usually a restaurant will let you substitute and if the alternate item is more expensive you pay the difference, not flat out refuse. So finally he said just leave the hash browns off the plate and he left it at that. When the food arrived, the plate was more than half covered with hash browns. The Waiter said the manager would not let them leave them off. We were there when they weren't' that busy and that kind of management policy is unbelievable. Honestly we all left realizing the food was sub-par, and not that good. Several left hungry and we simply will not return. We love trying new restaurateurs in the neighborhood and like to give our money to good independent places. This one however will soon fade to oblivion and we will not be returning.",

But there was just too much wrong to be able to write it off to those things.  It was chaos and disorganized, every step of the way.  The wait was much longer than the 20 minutes we were told, and when we went to check on how much longer, seemed they had forgotten us, so sat us right away.  Once we had ordered, we waited. And waited. And waited.  Meanwhile, tables that had been sat and ordered after us were getting their orders.  FINALLY our orders came, minus mine.  Everyone else had finished before mine came - after I reminded 2 wait staff I was still waiting on my order.  The manager did come by to say breakfast was on them today - that was nice.  However, when my breakfast finally came, it was NOTHING like the menu described - chilaquiles.  An avocado crudely cut into 3 large parts, and eggs over old mushy corn chips with cheese.  No veggies, salsa, chilies or sour cream.  On corn chips, not wheat chips. Like I said, just too much not to write this review.  The coffee was delicious - they do have that right.",

There were more wait staff than customers, and because of this the service was very attentive and the food came out quickly.  Our server John was great!  The issue is not with the service but the food.  I ordered Stuffed Berry Mascarpone Crepes, I received 3 large crepes with strawberries and blueberries sprinkled on top, the problem with the crepes is the mascarpone never made it into one of the crepes, the second had approximately 1 Tablespoon in the middle of the crepe, and the last one of the three had approximately 1 teaspoon again stuck in the middle.  My husband had a Morning Sunrise Omelet that was huge, the avocado was put into the egg mixture as a guacamole rather than as chunks.  While waiting for our check I saw one of the cooks (since the customers have a view of the kitchen it is open) playing with his orange hat and running his hands through his hair,  he then went back to cooking, without a break to wash his hands.  Now he may have had a sink in front of him, I just couldn't see it.",

Double tip dipping seems to becoming more common, so I'm going to post it where I see it.  What is double tip dipping?  It's when you charge the meal but provide a cash tip. You either cross out the tip line on the charge slip, or in my case I write \"CASH\" on that line. You then total the bill without the tip included (because you provided the cash). The restaurant then submits the bill to your credit card company with tip added. That's the double-dip.  These situations can usually be resolved with a credit card dispute. But really, why should the customer be inconvenienced this way? And I know a LOT of people never check their statements.  These double-dips happen because someone at the business is not paying attention, or worse doing this on purpose. I'm very hesitant to return to a restaurant after I experience this once (9/16/18). I'm posting this now as I've just experienced a double-dip at a different restaurant (12/7/18).  Elly's customers, check your credit card statements.",

    "text": "First time at Elly's, what a fab new find for Cenpho breakfast / lunch !!!   Service was extremely excellent .  Nick our server brought the delicious food promptly and kept our coffee hot and refilled.   The spartan eggwhite omelet consists of tomatoes , spinach, shiitakes and feta with hash browns and buttermilk pancakes !   Everything tasted so fresh and homemade.   The European breakfast  Is Greek yogurt with berries and granola and was beautifully presented and delicious.   The patio is dog friendly.   The space is airy and modern without the pretentious attitude some Cenpho places have ( ahem)  Will be back as a regular !",

I ordered the \"Elly's health club 9\" and the meal in itself was good, and tasty, what surprised me is that the fruit was a slice of melon, slice of honeydew and slice of watermelon. Would have been great if it was a a large bowl with assorted fruit.   I ordered a Bloody Mary and that also was not up to regular Bloody Mary standards, event the server said she'll put more spice in it and with that it wasn't spicy at all, and tasted a bit watery and bland.   I'll give it another try and order another menus item and a drink. Hopefully it'll be better.",

I was stuck between the migas frittata and SW frittata. I ended up getting the SW Frittata which consisted of hash browns, tomatoes, bacon, and jalapenos (minus the onions) topped with cheese. It also came with a side of fluffy pancakes or toast. I opted for pancakes. Lord it was so good! I'm craving those pancakes again!!!  I came with some friends and everyone loved what they ordered.  They got a salmon bagel, biscuits and gravy, an eggs Benedict, miga frittata, and juevo rancheros. We will be returning!",

Elly's is tucked back in the corner of the Uptown Plaza on Central and Camelback (near Lou Malnatis & Creamistry). Don't let the size fool you, there is actually a lot of space inside and we have never waited more than 15 minutes for a table.  The menu is fairly extensive and includes pancakes, waffles, omelettes, frittatas, sandwiches and salads. There is also a coffee/tea bar with lots of delish options.  I've had the morning omelette (pictured) and the corned beef hash, both of which were phenomenal! I would say the corned beef hash was the best thing I have had. They have gluten free options as well, the pancakes were great! Someone else at our table had a frittata (also pictured) and said it was really good as well.   What's even better, Elly's is one of the cheaper breakfast spots in the neighborhood and the staff is terrific! Definitely would recommend Elly's.",

The menu is extensive with many different savory and sweet options to choose from and while it may seem overwhelming at first, it seems as though you could not go wrong with any choice. I ordered the migas frittata and it was delicious. It came in a skillet with melted queso fresco on top, flavorful chorizo mixed in, and cilantro and green onions to bring some freshness! The portion was also huge and I was only able to finish half of my meal. I opted for the pancakes as my side and I'm so glad I did. The pancakes are so fluffy!! My boyfriend ordered the apple cinnamon chip pancakes and he loved his dish!! The apples were cooked perfectly - they were soft and covered in a delicious cinnamon syrup that made the pancakes so flavorful! The only suggestion we had was to layer the cinnamon apples between each of the pancakes instead of just topping the whole stack with the apples! We will definitely be back to try some other brunch options next time!",

I was shocked when I walked inside because the place looks like it would be kind of small from the outside but it is surprisingly big and spacious on the inside.  There are a small amount of tables for outside dining.  You can walk up and order some cold pressed juices and pastries to go.  The menu is huge!  So many options!  We had a little bit of everything between the four of us.  Huevos Rancheros, Corned Beef Hash, Chicken and Waffles and some gluten free Chocolate Chip Pancakes with a side of bacon.  We also ordered Banana Nutella Pancakes just because the pancakes on the tables around us looked so good we had to each have a few bites.  Portions are average (not enormous) which I think is a good thing. It did seem like we spent a lot on brunch though so the prices are a little higher, I would say.  In spite of us arriving on Sunday after church, we were seated right away (due to all the space in this place I'd say) and our service was quite quick as well.  Great brunch spot, definitely worth a visit!",

My order was wrong, but that's ok because sometimes that happens anywhere 2. Our waiter dropped off our food and never came back to check what we needed! I WAVED down another waiter for a refill of drinks and she just went to find our original waiter. Who again didn't refill, she just sent another guy waiter. 3. After our waiter NOT ONCE checked on us, she drops the bill and we ask her for some tortillas and brings us one tortilla ONE!. 4. Our waiter never cleared our table but rushes to grab our debit card. Sorry but I left $0 tip, but I wrote the reason why on the receipt. Hopefully they can get a better team.",

They also have a delicious juice/espresso bar at the front of the restaurant for walk-up service or to order from during a sit-down meal. The service has always been fantastic!

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and ordered the eggs over medium as opposed to the suggested scrambled on the menu. The hash browns came out nice and crispy, the huevos rancheros were arranged in an orderly fashion, stacked like pancakes. The salsa was not the usual fresh tomato salsa version but a roasted chile like chipotle style. The stack consisted of layers of eggs, wheat tortillas, black beans, queso fresco and avocado. The taste was good but the reason for the 3 star is the food was cold in the middle.",

They were sitting on top of a melange of unseasoned mushrooms and chopped tomatoes which was on top of something simply unidentifiable.It looked like a piece of soggy cardboard. It was literally unchewable .I spit it out and I called the waitress over to ask her to identify it and she said it was half a croissant. No way. This did not resemble or taste like anything in the bread group. The Hollandaise sauce was watery and had way too much lemon. Not anything like Hollandaise, it was not as good as  the instant Hollandaise in an envelope you get from the grocery  The hash browns were frozen from a box and also cold.   I left  the entire mess on my plate and the waitress picked it up with my check without comment. My companion had two pancakes with maple syrup. He said they were o.k. but not any better than Denny's. Also not a fan of the mile high industrial chic ceiling which makes it impossible to carry on a conversation because of the noise. I can't remember when I had a meal so bad I left almost  all  of it on the plate.",

Been there a total of 4 times since they've opened and have experienced nothing but subpar service and meal quality. I'm 100% convinced they cannot cook an egg other than scrambled. Other than the hosts and hostesses, I'm also convinced the waitstaff is huffing ether in the back of house. As somebody who frequently visits independent restaurants, it's clear that this place will not last. I give them another 18 months tops before having to shut their doors... unless they come to reality and deliver what Phoenix wants. This isn't Chicago, people... sorry.",

The bacon was perfect and the crepes were amazing even my kids enjoyed finishing them for me!  My friend had the chilaquiles verde and said they were very good he didnt even leave any for me to try!  All the kids ordered the mickey/minnie mouse pancakes.  Those came with whipped cream and pineapples and strawberries.  Very big serving so the kids didnt finish them.  I would have given 5 stars but the kids food was served after our food.  My recommendation would be to ensure all kids food is brought out first.  The kids were grabbing at our food while they waited for theirs.  Then when their food came out we had 5 plates of pancakes to cut up so our food was getting cold in the meantime.  Otherwise loved the place!",

I went here for the first time for lunch and had a Reuben sandwich that was just OK. My mom had the healthy protein plate with cottage cheese, eggs, etc. That was simple and plain. I went back a second time last week for brunch. I had been eating a lot of eggs and potatoes in recent days. So I didn't want that if I could help it. But I didn't want oatmeal either. I was pleasantly surprised to find a healthy breakfast bowl of brown rice, sweet potatoes, kale and coconut curry. It was actually tasty and I liked the taste of cumin.  Their patio is a little cramped, especially if you have a dog. But I like that they have one at all. The entire restaurant is pretty big so I think that helps with the wait time not being too bad on weekends. I didn't see groups waiting for too long. Of course, if this place becomes like another Snooze AM, that could change.  The service is decent. When I was there last, almost an hour had passed and we still didn't have our food. Luckily, took me a while to notice because I was engrossed in conversation with my friend. Well, it turns out their printer ran out of paper and so our order never got printed out. Our female server could not have been more contrite. She said \"of course there will be a discount.\" We got 50 percent off our bill. I think that was fair.   Basically, I could see going here with a group or a couple visitors. But the food isn't anything that will knock the socks off.",

We ordered the steak and mushroom skillet and a morning sunrise omelette. I liked that you can get pancakes instead of toast (we did) and all the food was really up to par.",

I don't know whether it was the pancakes or the syrup or the blend of the two that produced such a uniquely delicious pancake experience, but they were fantastic. Everything else was good, too. The service was pleasant and the place was hopping on a Saturday morning. My only complaint was that it was pretty loud--my son sitting right next to me had to get close or shout to be heard. Next time we'll try sitting outside and if that helps.",

The cafe is moderately large for a breakfast/brunch place and simply appointed, with a theme that matches the mid-century modern vibe of the commercial plaza. My friends and I came really early on a Sunday to avoid the crowds that we're heard can create quite a wait on weekends. The food was very good, and very well priced for the quality and quantity that you get. Service was very friendly, and while some reviews groused about the speed of the service, we did not encounter any issues; this may be because we came at opening time, before the weekend brunch crowd arrived. Glad to have this establishment in my neck of the woods, and I hope they'll be around for a very long time.",

I was invited to breakfast early this Saturday morning. Party of six immediately sat, think it helped that we came at 7 A.M.   Ordered the meat lovers skillet with over medium eggs, came with a side of pancakes. The portions here are pretty large- served on an actual skillet. Personally, too much hash browns are served on the skillet making it kind of hard to find the meat. I'm sure they can do with only placing half the amount of hash browns on the skillet to have less waste. The pancakes themselves are pretty basic, no frills. Mine actually happened to be just a tad under done. Bonus point for providing room temperature butter so you can actually spread on to pancakes.   Coffee is pretty good, I didn't see any on our table nor did I ask, but no raw sugar packets. Which is my sugar of choice. Kiddo ordered the Mickey Mouse pancake served with whipped cream, strawberries, and canned pineapple. Not sure if whipped cream was from a can or fresh, hopefully fresh whipped. Unsure why canned pineapple was on pancake- maybe kids like it better or something? My kiddo didn't care for it as he loves fresh pineapple.",

Our first choice was closed so Yelp led us here, Elly's.  Located at the corner of Camelback and Central, this area has really turned the corner on hipness. Lou Malnaties is here, a spruced up AJ's, and other boutique stores.  Started off with a cocktail, duh! I've never been into Bloody Marys but decided to change it up today and really was glad I did.  Had the Diablo, extra spicy, two large olives and Ghost Pepper vodka.  The P kept telling me to slow down until breakfast was served, it was a challenge.  Note to Elly, I understand the need to prep the celery and olives to expedite the drinks but my celery was completely wilted and brown, inedible and took away from the experience-but the drink was excellent. P had mimosas and was content as always.  I had the migas frittata; spicy chorizo, avocado, jalapeno, cilantro, etc.  Sounded great on paper, on the plate, just kind of average-a little too commercial, not enough soul for me.  Spicy chorizo and jalapeno screams hot and this little doll was a lukewarm poser.  Completely edible and enjoyable but certainly will never be reordered.    Elly's menu is incredibly large and I may go back to indulge in some carbs like crepes, pancakes, or waffles. I'd definitely recommend Elly's. She has a great vibe, interesting decor and solid food & cocktails.  The service was excellent and inviting.  3.5 stars.",

Our particular server was pushy, rude, and often times absent. We had to get up and request several things from other staff or request her presence. However, all of the other staff was very helpful and responsive. The juice and smoothie bar was a great addition. I order the sweet potato bowl that had rice and curry. The curry was good but the rice was undercooked. The gluten free pancakes were light and fluffy! Delicious. The Nutella latte was good but very sweet. The experience overall was just Ok and I'd say that it doesn't evoke a desire to ever return.",

They accommodated the request and boy was it delicious, give this a try if you like waffles!  The waffle here has consistently been crispy and light and airy, not dense like a lot of other places.   My husband got the avocado wrap which was super bland and didn't seem to have any seasoning. I do not recommend this. The hash browns on the side that it came with were good with some salt and pepper and the latte was also decent.",

Major plusses- - the place is huge so the likelihood that you'll have to wait a half an hour or more to get a table is really small.  - location is terrific. - each of the times we were here the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming.  Elly's doesn't read hipster to me at all. It reads as a classic breakfast joint, kid friendly, straightforward.  Unlike a lot of our breakfast places around town, which I also love by the way, Elly's is really classic (not in the French way) in terms of menu. You won't find any wild and crazy concoctions here.  Yes, the menu is extensive, but it is comprised of just a handful of essential ingredients changed up for different menu items.  Skillets and scrambles Benedicts Pancakes, crepes, and waffles A couple different kinds of bread And a variety of veggies, meats, and cheeses to satisfy any palette  We really liked the food. My kids loved their crepes and pancakes. My over medium eggs were cooked perfectly, which is typically not the case elsewhere.   If you keep your expectations simple, Elly's is easy to enjoy and perfect for a close-by family breakfast.",

We ordered that to go as we ordered other food for the table. BTW orange juice was fresh squeezed and SWEET! Get what you are craving. It's all prepared well. Will be back as a staple when we visit our college student. Ten minutes from GCU. German pancake was crispier than expected based on a traditional Pancake House, but very good. Don't know that I would wait 45 minutes to be served. Perhaps call ahead?",

We were pleasantly surprised to see how big it was on the inside and we didn't have to wait to get a booth.   The menu is great. It has great a nice variety of skillets, omelets, and breakfast sandwiches.   I ordered the homemade corn-beef hash and eggs with a side of pancakes. For this particular dish they pair it with a poached egg. I always tend to go with the recommendations of the kitchen and gave it a shot. When my dish came out I cut into the poached egg to see the golden liquid flow out on the white light pillow. The pancakes came out, they were two stacks, and extremely fluffy!! Everything was exactly what I wanted. Yumm factor: very high.   My dining companion had the meat skillet. It was big, cheesy, crispy hasbrown, and full of meat. Everything you would want in a skillet. He decided to get the pancakes as well which were just as fluffy.   As far as the logistics goes:   The restaurant was clean. The staff was very friendly. The owner came by and made us laugh. The prices were very reasonable for the amount of food we ate. The staff worked together to make sure our drinks were filled and our plates were cleared. The services was very satisfactory.   The only one draw back was the kitchen needs to fine tune exactly what to fire. Our food which was extremely delicious, came out to our table at different times.   Will we go back?: HECK YES! This restaurant is  close (check), has great staff (check), has great food (check), and great prices (check).  VERDICT: Go and check it out for sure!  BTW: The only reason it is a 4 and not 5 star is the lack of liquor license. I would have loved a Bloody Mary with my breakfast.",

We came here to celebrate our cousins 1st wedding Anniversary and I was worried that this place was going to be a bust.  BUT I was greatly Impressed, the food was delicious and on point on how we ordered it.  When we come back into town again, we will visit again.",

They have great fancy drinks too like the mimosa made your way. Highly recommend. Only downfall is that it is small and there is usually a wait time. So be ready to have a relaxing brunch not rushed.",

    "text": "This beautifully hot summer Sunday my boyfriend and I went to Elly's looking for a new brunch place we hadn't been to before. After reading some yelp reviews we decided to go. When we got to Elly's it was packed and had some couples in front of us, the hostess said there would be a 20 minute wait for a table, but we got in less than 5 minutes from walking in. When we sat down we looked over the menu and were greeted by our server who brought water and a smile.   My boyfriend ordered a coffee and I ordered a hot nutella latte. There was a bit of a mix up between the runners and our server who placed a cold nutella latte in front of me but our server corrected it and apologized saying it was for the next table down. We then ordered our meal I got the Sticky Bun and my boyfriend ordered the Chilequiles, which was by far the star of the meal. The buns were good but by the end they were getting a bit too sweet even for my sweet tooth.   I did see that between the staff there were some mix up in food orders and that there were runners and servers trying to find where dishes were suppose to go. But that all comes with new staff and a new restaurant system.   All in all it was a great place for brunch. There were lots of families and couples so it's a wonderful place for all ages. The food was excellent and fresh, the staff smiling and apologetic if anything went wrong. It's also within the hub of north central Phoenix.",

A spacious, open and comfortable restaurant, we knew we were in for a treat.   We received wonderful service, and lots of choices. I started with their chai latte, which was a delight. The menu was huge, so we took our time. I opted for their original Benedict. It features \"fall off the bone ham\" and that's what you get.  So savory and delicious.   My husband ordered an avocado-kiwi smoothie, which he loved.  He also got the waffle, which was great. Our son had an omelette which was very filling.    Great first experience!",

It's stuck in the back of the shopping center with AJ's as its anchor; therefore, one better know it's there cause there's no street signage, that's for sure.  I had the Hawaiian omelet with an extra side of sausage links, and she had the avocado wrap.   Mine came with hash browns and a choice of pancakes, and hers came with hash browns with a choice of fresh fruit.  She also ordered cold press coffee with cream.   She thought the cream would be on the side.   It wasn't; it was added, and she declared it too sweet.   I liked it so I drank it.  The omelet was good.    The addition of the pineapple is interesting, but I knew it would be added so that's all right.   It was light and fluffy with the addition of the other ingredients.   The hash browns and pancakes were good, nothing spectacular that made them stand out but good.  She said her wrap was good as well, and since she finished it, it must have been.  Our server was professional and friendly.   I'd probably return cause of the variation of the menu.   It seems to be a good breakfast location as far as the choices.",

The place is nice and clean, if a little barn like. 4. They have a gluten free menu.  Not so good:  The food. The first tell is the very large menu. Nobody can do  that many dishes well. I had an omelette. It turned out to be more of  a tasteless egg hash. The toast was not toasted. The kitchen that can't turn out a piece of toast... Need I say more...

    "text": "Cute brunch spot, but the savory food lacked a lot of flavor and seasoning in my opinion.  The restaurant looks really small from the outside but they have plenty of seats inside; good for groups of any size. We decided to dine outside because the weather was nice. Thankfully we beat the brunch crowd because we were seated immediately.  The service was great and they constantly checked up on us. They made sure our waters were filled and everything was okay. They have a huge menu with tons of sweet and savory brunch items. I ordered the steak & wild mushroom skillet and it included two pancakes and two eggs cooked to my preference. Half of my skillet was hash browns and it didn't come with as much steak as I wanted, but for $13 I shouldn't set my expectations that high. My only complaint is that the meal lacked a lot of flavor and I had to eat it with extra salt, pepper, and ketchup. I also took some samples of my in-law's sandwiches and I wasn't impressed by those either. They enjoyed their sandwiches but I'm picky with food. The pancakes were fluffy and good though.  I wouldn't mind trying this place again because the service was great. I'd probably try a sweet brunch item instead of a savory one though.  If you are looking for an affordable brunch spot with big portions, this place might be for you! But don't say I didn't warn you about the lack of flavor..",

With a wide ranging menu and good prices Elly's is a worthwhile stop, especially for breakfast.   The food is served hot and fast. For the adults the omelette, frittatas, and hash are recommended AND they come with pancakes instead of toast. For the kids the French toast is really tasty and honestly enough to feed an adult!  Outdoor seating here was always in the shade and there's enough room outside the kids to run around so if you're looking for a family spot I recommend Elly's.",

I looked at other yelp pictures, every one received 2 slices with their order. So 2 +2=4?? Why lie? Just say, oh let me go get the other toast.  Anyway. As for the food- Everything tasted really well made and delicious.  Everything was well priced for what you get.

And being a lover of meat it has my stamp of approval. The hash browns yummy I could describe it with crunch and seasoned so good. But I choose yummy. The pancakes they are not the pancake house but they knocked it out of  the park.   Service- Gillian was so fun cool and helpful. Glasses always full.

At 11:00 am we had about a 20 minute wait, which isn't too bad considering there are lots of cute little boutiques that you can pop in and look around that are within short walking distance. I ordered the Morning Sunrise omelette, which was actually quite good! The egg was fluffy, and it had bacon, avocado, onion and cheese inside. The hash-browns were bland, but a pinch of salt and some Cholula hot sauce helped that. I thought the toast was hard as a brick, but my friend did state she likes hard toast so I guess that would be up to preference. The restaurant itself is extremely noisy - I don't know what it is about the reverberation in there, but it's pretty droning when filled with people and the clashing of dishes is deafening. As I told my friend, it's not a place I would bring my grandparents.",

    "text": "Tried this place out on a very busy Sunday morning and it was worth the wait!   We waited about 20 mins for a table but as soon as we sat down, the service was super speedy! The amount of time we waited for a table took much longer than actually waiting for our food! I was surprised and impressed since it was pretty busy.   So the service was great, but the food was just as good! I ordered the Southwest frittata with a side of pancakes. The portion was big enough for at least two people to share! It was so good and tasty!!   The only downside is that there isn't a lot of waiting room inside. So it sucks when they're on a wait on a really hot (or \"cold\") day!",

I love their French Toast, it's one of the best I've had and I get French Toast almost every time we go to a brunch place.  I had an iced chai latte and loved it! We've had the same server the last couple of times we've been there and she wasn't too great, hardly talked to us. But the food was great and came out very quickly so can't complain!  Love it!! Definitely a place that we will continue going to. It's also in a great location, in the Up Town Plaza on Central and Camelback, so the atmosphere is great.",

    "text": "First time at the Arizona location. The restaurant is huge, modernish looking. Host was very welcoming, the restaurant was nearly empty on a Tuesday morning around 730. The food was good. I got the waffle and eggs, my boyfriend got the egg sandwich which comes with a huge portion of hash browns. He said the sandwich was really good, he also got a side of the brioche French toast. He said my waffle tasted better then the French toast, nothing to write home about. We will be back when we have more time to try the German pancake (takes 30 min to bake). Our server was very attentive, great service.  Gave this restaurant another try. We tried the Dutch baby, the country benedict and the regular Benedict. The server seemed to forgot about out Dutch baby (I know they take awhile to cook) but we ordered the Dutch baby as soon as we sat down. Then once he came back to take our order we ordered the bene's. The server cleaned up our plates and asked if we needed anything else and we said our Dutch baby. He looked like he had that \"oh crap look.\" Not saying he forgot to put the order in because he brought us syrup at the beginning, but we did have to wait about 20-25 more minutes after finishing our food for the Dutch baby to come out. Country bene was good, my boyfriend thought the gravy could be better. He said the Dutch baby was cooked perfect tho. We came Saturday about 9 and it was very busy, no wait quite yet but almost full.",

Well we have been here at least 15-20 times with 2-16 people and everything in between including lots of kids.  The food and service have been over the top every single time.  When they were extremely busy the wait time was very acceptable.  We have never had a bad menu item, never a cold entree, and never broken toast as stated in one review. ( however if mine was broken it would just save time in having to break off a piece) The hostess' that seat you have always been helpful, overly friendly, and always with a big smile.  One review stated no one smiled.....ridiculous.  Ellys has has gotten a bad rap in stars which in turn hurts their location order.  Please read into the different reviews of less than 5 stars and you'll see for yourself....Perfection will not make them give a positive or 5 star review!!!!!!!!!!!  Note:  We live at 91st Ave and Peoria Ave. and this is the by far the best breakfast restaurant we have....so we drive the 35 minutes for a great experience.  SFH (Going in the AM.)",

    "text": "I was looking forward to trying a new restaurant in my neighborhood with an early opening, but I made two huge mistakes on my first visit.  One mistake was coming alone, and the other was walking on a summer morning. The staff seated me but apparently decided my sweaty, single self wasn't a legit customer, as with the restaurant 80% empty, they simply didn't serve me. No water, no coffee, no \"be just a minute,\" no \"any questions about the menu?\" -- every staffer acted as if I were invisible. Clear intent was to get me to leave, so I did.  If you feel your look and pedi can pass the Elly's Test, be warned that the place is LOUD and feels like a hipster cafeteria. Intimate conversation? Not gonna happen. Working on your laptop or tablet? Good luck with that!   (My pedicure actually has reached the state of being kind of gross, but I'm putting my feet UNDER the table, not on it, and I'm expecting to be brought coffee, not have my toes sucked.)  The menu is basic chi-chi upscale farm-raised stuff, so if you sleep in, just go to Flower Child at the front of the same plaza.",

They catered to every modification on our orders without any push back. When we asked for a change the response was always, \"sure, no problem\". I really love this attitude!   The food was tasty. The omelettes were cheesy and well prepared. Tastes fresh and there wasn't an overload of grease as some places tend to have. The pancakes were light fluffy and tasty. The one drawback was the Nutella was not Nutella, but watered down and perhaps even caramelised a bit, tasty nevertheless buy not what I wanted.   Overall top notch place.

She stated she could not give all of us our drinks because there was not enough cups to go around for everyone. I finished most of my meal by the time I got my Orange juice, which I had to ask for it, for a second time. My bill was $20.10, I gave the waitress $40.10 and asked for her to give me change for the 20 dollar bill and said \"okay\". I got the tab back and realize she only gave me back $10 and tipped her self a generous amount of $10 without my consent. At this point I went up to the counter and explain the issue to a second waitress. The waitress turns around and hands it to our waitress. The waitress then argues with me and only gives me 5 dollars back. She still managed to keep my money without my consent. It's definitely a issue that should be addressed by management and not ignored.",

The location is very open and family friendly.  Moderate noise is very accurate. The large open seating helps drown out the noise though. The menu isn't too big which is a good thing sand made it easy to order. I got the Latina omelette and a Bloody Mary while a friend got a mimosa.   Drinks were a little pricy for the size, but the dishes were very filling. The pancakes on the side were decent. The dish was filling but mediocre in general. The waitress was attentive but not overbearing. We got the check in a timely fashion and were out of there.  In conclusion, i would come back but i would definitely get something else and hold off on the special drinks.",

Its a great location, open spaced, staff ( except the lady at the front) was welcoming..but the food was basic, like your moms cooking.) It has no signature style, no twist or \"elly\" to the food,  the pancakes had no flavor, the syrup was thin..   Sorry.",

It was all perfect! The hashbrowns were incredibly good, the bacon is really thick and perfectly cooked, and everything just tasted like a real breakfast. The waiter was so enthusiastic about my simple order, and the atmosphere, although in a large space, felt really nice to me. I highly recommend this place for breakfast!",

My dad got an omelet with a side of pancakes, I ordered the chicken and waffles, rest of the family also got pancakes and some form of eggs. We put in the order and about 10 minutes later, the waiter came back and told me they were out of chicken and waffles. Mind you, it is 9:30am, no more than a few hours after opening. So I instead ordered the french toast with a side of chicken sausage. The french toast was bland and dry, the chicken sausage was amazing! Whatever the brand, probably the best I have had. Everybody said the eggs were okay, but the pancakes were super dry and had too much vanilla. Do not know if we will return",

Even though no one was in the restaurant in took her an insanely long time to bring waters and coffee.   When the food arrived I immediately noticed a hair in my hashbrowns. I had the hair on the fork and I was holding it up to show her at which time the waitress rudely and loudly shouted \"well, don't eat it!\". Ok, why would I eat  a hair? Clearly she was just being a jerk.  Then the bill came and it appeared I was being charged for my meal but not my coffee. Ok, I thought, usually restaurants comp your meal if a hair was in it but maybe she just comped my coffee? Wrong. She didn't comp anything. When she noticed she didn't charge my coffee she took the bill back and re- did it! You've got to be kidding me! Won't be coming back..",

They were very busy on a Sunday and the waitress was working hard but she didn't ask us how the food was.  I could tell she was a good and seasoned waitress so I assume others have had my experience and she didn't want to deal with it.  We were in a rush so we did not voice our food issues with management.  We all left sizeable portions of our meals uneaten because it was just bad.  My wife's eggs benedict was overpoweringly lemon flavored, eggs were cooked all the way through and hash browns were tasteless.  My 4 & 6 year old's eggs tasted like they had no salt or butter and were runny.  Pancakes were also overdone and crispy.  They also didn't like their hash browns.  I had chicken and waffles and the waffle was good but the chicken was so fatty I couldn't believe it.  They might have been the fattiest chicken legs I have ever eaten.    I can't remember the last time that none of my family had a good meal.  The restaurant was very busy and we waited a while so I was hopeful to get quality food.  Maybe I'll give it another try in the future and see if they've worked out their issues but for now I cannot recommend :(",

My friend ordered the stuffed avocado and I ordered the Ole omelette. What she received was a sliced avocado with giant chunks of chicken slathered in mayonnaise. No seasoning, nothing crunchy in there, nothing. Chicken and mayo. Not appetizing at all. My omelette - not good. It looked like the aftermath of an omelette, a scramble maybe but this was no omelette. Looks aside it didn't taste good either. I did have some crispy hash browns. I ate those after a dosing of salt and pepper that was lacking. And the side of bacon we ordered, tasty. But its bacon, even at it's worst, it's still ok.  I so wanted to love this, it just disappointed on so many levels.",

Thankfully there was no wait, they sat us at a bigger table to accommodate for our infant carrier and the cold brew was yummy! Unfortunately, my omelet was essentially scrambled eggs arranged in a log and the hash browns were overcooked on the outside and almost raw in the middle. My breakfast came with a side of pancakes which were decent, nothing to write home about. The restaurant is huge inside, but felt awkward only being about a third full. The service was a little slow, I think the staff was still trying to figure things out. Ultimately, I would say skip the visit here and stick with a tried and True.",

On my first Mother's Day myself, my husband, my 3 month old, and one of my best friends decided to try this Chicago transplant out for brunch. I'd seen it on the news that they just opened this location and wanted to give this new location a try. Since I'm a Midwest girl, and Love Chicago, I picked this place to have brunch with my family. I'd visited Elly's in Chicago for brunch and loved it there, so I was expecting the same here---- not so.  Big disappointment. We were on their waiting list for over 40 minutes, when initially told there was a 20 minute wait. When our names weren't called after 40 minutes we went in to check and was told that they are now putting the list of names for people waiting \"on hold\" because their kitchen is backed up on orders, and priority is being given to those with reservations. Now I'm hungry, my infant son is cranky, and we have to find someplace else for brunch. We are  VERY disappointed in the way service was handled.",

Total for two of us before tip was $44, that's never going to grab a breakfast regular.   The parking has always been a challenge in this center and it wasn't any better today.

Their Rueben's are delicious as well, the meat is super good quality which is nice.

We love all the selections here, all excellently prepared with generous portions.  The Pancakes are magnificent, unlike most others, they are bursting with rich flavor.  All Egg dishes are prepared perfectly, the Coffee is the best, and the Dining Room is comfortable and airy.    Elly's is the best in town, don't pass it up.",

    "text": "If you live in Phoenix and haven't tried Elly's Brunch & Cafe, get down there this weekend, or now! Truly some of the best pancakes I've ever had. Tucked in the northeast corner of the Uptown Plaza, Elly's is a happening breakfast spot to satisfy your craving for delicious skillets, scrambles, sweet breakfast treats and anything in between. First off, this place is HUGE you definitely can't tell how massive the restaurant is from the outside. I normally visit Elly's for early brunch on Saturday's or Sunday's and have never had to wait for a table. However by the time my party leaves around noon, I've noticed there is about a 10-15 minute wait, so come early! They do have a nice patio with misters right outside the front door to the restaurant. I can't wait to enjoy it in the cooler months! The service at Elly's is also excellent. You can tell the management has trained their peeps very well. Several times I've asked the wait staff for their recommendations and they are eager to help me choose the perfect dish. My go-to is the Southwest Frittata (Cherrywood bacon, avocado, onion, jalapeno, tomato and American cheese) with a side of pancakes. You just can't go wrong! Don't forget to order an Iced Chai or Matcha, both are so yummy! Next time I hope to try the breakfast sandwich, it looks delicious!",

The cold brew was smooth and delicious - no cream or sugar needed. My other half got the Wild Mushroom & Steak Skillet - the meat was moist, tender, flavorful and juicy. (Umm, can I have a plate of that only please?). I ordered the Benedict on the croissant with Portabella mushrooms and veggies. This was light and tasty, the hollandaise had a nice tang to it.  Will be back to try other menu items. Perhaps the Mascarpone crepes, but definitely another one of the Wild Mushroom & Steak Skillets (hold the hash).  Service was friendly and quick without making us feel rushed.",

Only one little gripe, by the time the toast gets to the table it won't melt the somewhat soft butter. That is something that many restaurants have a problem with. It is a restaurant I have recommended to others and I'm sure my friends and I will return again.",

Bring at least a party of 3 so you can all sample the dutch baby, the buckwheat pancake (!!!!!!!) and the chilaquiles verdes..... oh and maybe the classic crepe - BEST crepe in town .... oh and get the biscuits & gravy - different-ish but delicious. If you go early, there is hardly even a wait. Pro tip: the buckwheat pancakes taste amazing on day one... but if you have leftovers and microwave them the next day they are almost as good.... and you wait one more day- they are still f-ing amazing.",

The service was prompt on getting us our drinks and taking our order. (Friendly staff) Always keeping our coffee cups filled.  I ordered the avacado wrap with bacon and a side of hash browns. The pics on Yelp looked appealing so I decided to try it out. I was extremly happy with the hashbrowns. The wrap was good but only disappointment I had was barely any bacon in it. It was chopped up finly and very little to nothing in my wrap. Next time I come back I would try to ask for the bacon to come on the side so I get actual whole pieces or I would try the chicken option they offer. I think it would be nice if they offered complimentary coffee while you wait for your party to be seated.",

    "text": "Checked out this place for the first time. They are located in the Uptown Plaza at Central and Camelback, tucked away in the corner near West Elm and Creamistry. The patio and interior are decorated nicely and the staff was friendly. As I waited at the coffee center, more than once I was asked if I had been helped. I appreciate the attentiveness. I asked if they had any coffee drinks that could be made iced and was told that any of them can be made iced. I ordered the Mint White Chocolate in the 12 oz size along with a pastry for their grab and go special. The barista allowed me to sample the drink that is usually made hot to see if it was to my liking. It was creamy and minty and a nice spring green color. I agreed that it was great and got my pastry and left.  It wasnt until I arrived at work and was reviewing their to-go menu that what I ordered and what was on the menu listed an 12 oz or 16 oz drink. What I received was more like an 8 oz cup that was 1/2 to 3/4 of the way full. Other than the sip I had taken in the restaurant to taste, I had not consumed any more of the beverage.  I dont know if this size was for the grab and go special as it didnt indicate a size on the sign that I noticed.  I enjoyed the drink, althought I would have liked more of it. The pastry, an almond covered croissant, was generous in size and was fresh and flavorful.  Outside of the drink mishap, I think I will return to try lunch.",

    "text": "I've been mulling about how I feel about this place. Its definitely a grade A brunch spot comparable to all the other new brunch areas that have been opening up recently. Which I suppose is part of why I had to think of it so long. The place is cute and menu expansive but definitely not something new.  My Spartan omelet was jam packed and delcious. Pretty much all the food came with sides. My omelette came with hash browns AND toast.   They were doing a donation drive where if you donated money you get a pumpkin to decorate, which in turn they would put around the restaurant. I love that concept!! So neat and a nice touch seeing the unique pumpkins on everyone's tables.  I have to deduct a star because the service was extremely slow throughout the entire experience. There was a point where one person in our party had finished their drink before someone else could get their drink. They also had some condiments that were not available - for example barbecue sauce even though they serve burgers.  I can see Elly's being included in my brunch circuit - but definitely just when I have enough time and not to hungry to accommodate the slow service.",

    "text": "I would like to preface this review with the fact that - the food is absolutely delicious. Both times I've been here it's been absolutely delicious.  Unfortunately, today my fiance and I received very poor service. When we walked in we were greeted by a nice hostess who promptly seated us. When our server came over she wasn't very inviting, nor did she tell us her name or any sort of specials/recommendations. She asked us if we were ready to order, and we let her know that we weren't quite sure yet, and would need a few minutes.  About two minutes later we closed our menus and put them down, which is generally a good sign to indicate that you're ready to order. She didn't return back to our table for about 10 minutes, but we brushed it off because we figured it was our fault for not being prepared when she asked.  After we ordered, we didn't see her again until she brought our food to the table (the food was hot, and delicious). My fiance decided that he would like a coke, because initially we had only ordered water. She took so long to come back to our table, that we flagged a different waitress over to ask for a soda. The new waitress went and told Mikylah (our waitress) what we asked for, and we still didn't receive a soda for 12 more minutes. The new waitress then brought the soda over without any sort of apology or explanation.   We still hadn't talked to our serve, Mikylah, since our food was dropped off at our table. At this point we were completely done eating and ended up waiting over 15 minutes from the time we finished our food, until she came back to our table.   When she came back to the table, she didn't have our check ready and had to go back to get it. When she dropped it off we still didn't receive any sort of explanation or apology for the situation.  I'm not sure if she was training, or if it was just an off day- but it really was an unfortunate experience. Also, the restaurant was fairly empty and it looked like she was only responsible for our table (of two people) and another table (of 6 girls).",

The selection of iced teas is great and the peach tea I had was very good. The chocolate pancake was delicious and the maple syrup was very delicious.

After being seated, the waitress too forever to get around to getting our drink order and even longer to get the drinks. We ordered food and waited... I expected a wait for the food though. The dish itself, skirt steak and eggs, was definitely not worth the price ($17). I asked the waitress for salsa to hopefully spice it up. I should of known though... She brought me sauce and I had to remind her of the salsa. I would probably avoid this place in the future. I'm sure there are comparable places with better service.",

She attended us quickly, answered our questions and we had our food on our table just half an hour after arriving. My brother ordered French toast w/ hash browns which he seemed to love very much, along with a freshly squeezed orange juice. I ordered a (northwest or southwest) omelette w/ hash browns and some pancakes along with a beetilicious smoothie . The pancakes,smoothie and hash brown were great but the omelette was the only thing that wasnt satisfying, The eggs texture was more foam than it was a solid. And that's why they get a four star.",

    "text": "My GF and I were super excited to try a new brunch place in the valley after we watched a show about pancakes. We found this place as a possible restaurant to satisfy our taste buds but it was a great let down. The service was horrible. We got sat immediately and waited another 10 minutes to get our water and another 5-10 for our server to take our orders. After our waitress took our order, it was another 30-40 mins to wait for our order...I understand if I were at an steak house or super fancy establishment that has several courses but its unreasonable to wait this long for breakfast food. The host tried to mitigate the long wait with a piece of pastry that we did not even ask for when our food arrived. What's the point of that? Why not offer something in between? Even though this happened yesterday, I'm still slightly irritated. Please make your service more efficient or give proper updates, so your future patrons can order accordingly.",

    "text": "New joint in Uptown Plaza, direct from Chicago. Coffee was strong, which is exactly how it is supposed to be. My server, Nick, was cool and attentive at just the right frequency  (And he laughed at my jokes. A+). The food was great, especially the pancakes. I've had many a flapjack in my life and these rank at the top,  neck and neck with Dupar's in LA. These babies might be better because they are tasty and the right size , not hubcap-sized like Dupar's.  Elly's pancakes are slightly crispy  outside and so fluffy inside. Yum! Oh, and check out the chicken sausage. You will be surprised at the deliciousness. My new favorite spot? Might be.",

I ordered the Provance Benedict and my dad got the Chilaquilles and we were both impressed and satisfied with the meal. We will definitely be returning.",

I did not wait for a table and everyone was very friendly throughout the entire experience. The breakfast sandwich and hash browns were excellent! I also got the banana Nutella crepes, those were a disappointment. There was not even Nutella on them and the weren't very flavorful. So overall a good experience. I would recommend sticking with the savory items and not the sweet.",

    "text": "Sadly, I have to give them 3 stars. Would be 3.5 but that's not an option here.  Went there for breakfast today, June 24. We sat outside under the misters. The host and our waitress were super nice.  Inside it was jam packed. And the food tasted and looked good. The really bad part: we waited easily over 30 minutes for our 3 entrees. As nice as our waitress was she only came by once to refill water glasses, which is when I asked if they were catching the chickens to get the eggs. That's when she mentioned the issue with the kitchen.   The manager came to our table when we were almost done with our meals to apologise. He mentioned something about how hard it is to deal with sitting a group of 20 people while getting two or three other 4-tops at same time. Hmmmm.... usually not an issue for restaurants I've been to. Specially for breakfast.  We were also discounted some off the check.  Oh, the only issue with food: my friend ordered his eggs over medium. They came scrambled.  I'll come back, and I'll expect much quicker service.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed with this place. We were seated quickly and our server was friendly and personable but the food was just not good. My husband ordered a simple breakfast with eggs, sausage, hash browns and pancakes. The hash browns were undercooked and everything else was just fair. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and I get some people would say how simple that is and how expectations should be low but living in Central Phoenix I have had some mind blowing breakfast sandwiches. The eggs seemed mass produced and were not at all seasoned. The bread was completely dry and when I asked for an aioli or sauce they had nothing, offered mayo. Who doesn't have aioli?? After attempting to create my own \"sauce\" I ate the bacon off and called it good. I don't care for hash browns so the server offered fries and I accepted. Again, no seasoning and even after adding salt and pepper (which I never do to fries) they were still not good. Most places I would be willing to come back to try something different but if you can't even get the basics right I doubt you can do better. Very sad because the location is awesome.",

    "text": "Meh. The food was mediocre at best. The French toast was merely bread barely dipped in egg with a scoop of cold mascarpone in the center. The avocado bene looked like my 7 yr old niece made it for me. The poached eggs were cooked with a hard yolk and the mushrooms had a chewy as if they weren't cooked all the way texture. The hash browns were bland. My bf order a vanilla latte that looked like straight vanilla milk. The service was great but I need good food too to make me want to come back again. Snooze is way better and worth the wait.",
