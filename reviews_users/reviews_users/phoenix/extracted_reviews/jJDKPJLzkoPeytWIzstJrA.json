She noticed us looking very confused at the drink menu (we aren't huge beer drinkers), and she asked if this was our first time in. She then went on to recommend some awesome beers for us to sample, and now were craft beer lovers! She also recommended the mac and cheese which was amazing. We are not easy people to serve but she remembered everything without skipping a beat, all with a huge smile and a great personality! If you like great atmosphere, good food, great beers, and an awesome server then this is the place. We will definitely be back, but this time with friends.",

Immediately went back and informed manager. Couldn't have cared less. Said it couldn't have been his employee. Told him he might want to make sure no one had attached a skimmer to card reader. Didn't care. Made me think he might be part of the problem. Will never go back there and will warn all my friends.",

The wings and fried pickles were fantastic and come highly recommended!   The atmosphere and vibe of the place is very modern rustic!",

    "text": "We arrived and were told to seat ourselves so we did, no problem. About 10-15 minutes pass and no server has come to give us menus, again, no problem; we look the menu up on our phones and my friends go to the bar to order drinks and food while I stay with the table. While I'm waiting for my friends to come back, one of the servers comes and asks if I'm by myself or with a group and if I've been helped (the table was too large for one person so I understand). I explain the situation and she politely replies to let her know if we need anything. My friends come back about 10 minutes later with our drinks and another server/host comes and asks us if we've reserved the table. We tell her that we did not and were told to seat ourselves. She tells us we cannot sit at the table we've been at for 20-25 minutes and we ask if there's anywhere we can drink our beers since we've already ordered and weren't about to throw away a fresh glass of beer. We are told we can play one of the outdoor games while a table becomes available. Our wings take 20 minutes to be done and rather than a server come out to us and bring them, we go to the bar to ask about them and pick them up. We finish our beers and wings, which takes us about another 30 minutes and as we're leaving, we notice the table we were told we could not sit at was still unoccupied. Do not recommend this place as the service was nonexistent and we were kicked out of a table that remained empty the entire time we were there.",

    "text": "So... we arrived at Pedal Haus Brewery just a few minutes after a huge group (50-70) people who were there for a benefit bicycle ride. We were thinking we would be waiting for at least 45 min to an hour before being seated with really slow service. Fortunately we opted to eat indoors and only had to wait about 10 minutes!  Here's where things went from good to absolutely amazing, the service was just incredible and our server was very friendly and helpful with recommendations from the menu. She took our drink and food orders and within minutes our drinks were served. Our appetizer came out shortly thereafter and our main order was also brought to us just a few minutes after that.  I ordered the Block Party Burger which was good but not great after all \"Party\" is in the name so I was expecting a lot. I thought it needed more flavor added to the ground beef instead of what tasted just like ground beef with no additional seasoning. The fries were delicious which helped with the overall flavor of the dish which it needed. My wife ordered the Fungus Among Us pizza which she really enjoyed. I would say overall the food was average but the great service more than made up for it.  I probably would have only given them 3 stars, but our service was really, really great!!  We will be going back for another round within the next month or so and I'm hoping they will add a little more flavor to their Block Party Burger.  All in all it was a great lunch with outstanding service.",

There is a huge outdoor seating area and Biergarten (ping pong, bags, etc...), and many broken up indoor spaces for both small and large groups. The private seating next to the tanks looks like a very cool spot for a group of 10-20. The menu had many items that caught my eye. I opted for the friend pickles (both rounds and spears- the best of both worlds) and a Reuben (so as to avoid the mid afternoon burger coma.) Food tasted great, especially when paired with some great beers. I had their Oktoberfest (tis the season), and the double IPA (very good.) Our service was very good, although I bet they get tested when the brewery fills up at night. I am already looking forward to another trip to Pedal Haus, maybe by bike next time!",

I would rank overall a 3-4 because the venue was a 5 and the beer was really a 2. It's better that your grocery store finds, but not by much. I don't think it's the brewers fault, but the lack of good water in the area. Set your expectations for beer low and you will have a great time at the bar.",

    "text": "Great food, terrible service. Waiting 20 minutes instead of 5 for seating - likely due to the fact that the hostess wouldn't take a name for our party even when one was offered. Someone wandered up to our group (two couples) at one point and said, \"are you the party of three?\" Uh... no.   Two at our table ordered flights. One of the people at the table ordered beers from both pages of the draught list and the waitress came back 10 minutes later to tell them they could only pick beers from the first page of the list. When a replacement selection was made, she said \"oh... we don't have that again until March.\" Then why is it available for order?!?! What the hell? Our waitress knew absolutely nothing about beer.   Beers were okay. I sampled the Tripel, Cherry Sour, Porter, and Bourbon Stout. The tripel was okay, the sour lacked any substantial cherry flavor, the Porter was unremarkable and the stout was really potent. So much so that I could barely finish the small sample I had.   Service was terrible. Absolutely terrible. The only reason this place gets 3 stars instead of 1 was because the fish fry was so delicious and the cheese curds were effing incredible. Two types of tartar sauce are provided, both are equally delicious and one is more of southwestern spin on tartar. Three out of four at our table  had the fish fry. The fourth ordered the mac and cheese and said it was terribly bland. She had to ask for salt and pepper to try and add some flavor. Someone else at our table tried a bite and confirmed it was flavorless. $14 for flavorless mac and cheese. Great! The bill came to $105 and it didn't feel like we overpaid at all other than the extremely generous person who left a tip.",

    "text": "Meh.  I'll cut them a bit of slack because it was their first weekend open.  However, the place really rubbed me the wrong way.  Beer selection- They actually have a good selection for snobs and those who could care less.  Seasonal brews, brews you've never heard of, and although not my personal favorite, a good selection on IPA's.  The sizes on their draft selection is a bit odd, either 16 or 32 ounces.  Don't get me wrong I love a big beer, but with some of those heavier darker beers I'd love a mid size so it doesn't get too warm.  Atmosphere- The place is huge, with a huge patio and plenty of seating.  It seems they could accommodate parties of any size. There are a few bars to sit and relax as well.  Plenty of tvs turned to the correct (sports) stations.  Food- The lady and I wanted a few appetizers before we went out.  The menu is small (why the huge kitchen?) and leans more toward the \"crafty\" style food.  We had the prime rib rolls and some french fries.  The food was actually pretty good, but the cost was definitely not worth it. For 2 beers and the appetizers it was $42. A little hefty for a college area bar if you ask me.  Service- This is where my complaints are.  First, it took the lady 10 minutes to greet us.  After browsing the menu with like 6 items on it, we made our choices before she even came over.  The beer mugs definitely weren't chilled either, but that is management/ownerships fault if they don't have enough mugs to keep cool.  Once our food came out, my girlfriend had asked if they had any ketchup because their $5 fries aren't served with any sauces.  He said they were out of ketchup (which happens, I get it).  I then asked if they had any ranch. I kid you not the guy said to me \"you're at a fancy place, we don't have ranch\".  I wasn't aware I was at a Michelin Star Restaurant (even those have ranch).  That guy really rubbed me the wrong way, so we asked for some aoli, which apparently they had but never showed up to our table.  We came on the Saturday night with ASU playing a home game (most left by half-time) and the Summer Ends festival all happening within a mile of the place.  We showed up at 10:15ish and the hostess told us they served food til 11.  Once our waitress showed up, she said they stop serving food at 10:30.  Again, why the trouble with the big kitchen if you're not going to serve food with two of the biggest events in town?  As I looked around the restaurant, next to nobody was even eating!  Huge waste of opportunity!  Here's my advice to you Pedal Haus- expand your menu to hit a larger demographic and also maybe serve food until, ya know, midnight like most other places down Mill.  Especially since it isn't a club-type atmosphere, why waste that much money making a beautiful kitchen if you aren't going to use it during peak hours? I just don't understand.  Also, your employees are a little pretentious and don't have great customer service skills.  For now, though Im staying away until I hear of improvement.",

When I tried to catch them as they went by with their heads down they would just shake their head like I was wrong for trying to get their attention. Shame on management for not properly staffing a bar on a game day.",

I've been to quite a bit of bars around town and I'm pretty sure everyone has their version of cheese curds. Its kind of like pizza, you can't really screw it up too bad. This goes without saying the cheese curds at this place is hands down the best I've ever had! I literally I go to just eat their curds. Plus they've got a great selection of beer. I mean beer and cheese curds how much better can it really get?",

For awhile I let some disappointing things slide bc it was new- but it's been open for several months now so I feel a honest review is warranted. I do enjoy their large patio with lots of outdoor games and the fire pit. The patio provides a cozy place to sit and watch the game while staying warm. The drink menu is good, I enjoy the wine but their beer list offers a great selection. The waiters Gina and Bryce are wonderful. The only thing about this place that really does not sit well with me is the kitchen situation. They have a space for a food truck to come serve food but I've only seen it being used once, and even then it stopped serving food around 10. As a brewery, there needs to be an option to grab something to eat. I've come here before and been starving and they offer no solution. Either the kitchen needs to stay open late offering late night snacks or the food truck set up needs to be utilized better. Finally- add pretzels to the menu- it's a brewery. Will be returning but hoping to try more of their food later at night.",

They have two beer menus, one of in-house brews, and the other with \"guest\" brews. I personally fell in love with the Bernsteinfarbenes Weizen Brewed in house, it's great tasting with hints of caramel and a deep amber hue. The beer is definitely reason enough for me to return, but the food, oh my god, the food is absolutely to die for. The atmosphere is amazing, pedal haus put some serious money into decorations and the sheer size of the restaurant is almost overwhelming. To top it all off the service was excellent, our server Domenic was incredibly attentive and knew his stuff. Pedal Haus is a wonderful treat for all of your senses. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends.",

I came here with a large party and there was one server who appeared to be overwhelmed by the number of tables in her area. Our food and drink orders took a very long time and one person in our party did not get his food until 30 minutes after everyone else. Although this was frustrating, slow service is understandable  with a large party. What is not understandable is when we asked to speak with a manager. He took 20 minutes to come to our table, accused us of lying about when we put our orders in and told us to \"calm the f$&@ down.\"  None of us had even raised our voices.  I have never experienced a manager express such a lack of concern towards upset customers. DO NOT GO HERE!",

We then proceeded to watch the hostess seat other people and get them waters. We sat there for 15 minutes and no one, not even a waiter/waitress/server approached us to ask if we had been helped. We'd had enough. We left and went and told the same hostess that had seated us and bluntly said we were taking our business to Zipps across the street.

Thank goodness for Pedal Haus because I was about to pass out! It was toasty out there.   Anywho, we quickly ordered a cold beer, hung out on their couches inside near the front bar area {great for groups!}, and ordered some munchies! I ordered their wheat beer and it was delicious. It came in a fancy rounded glass that felt very classy! I also ordered pretzel bites that came with maple butter + cheese sauce and chicken tenders! The breading on the chicken tenders was so crispy and fantastic. They too came with great dips - I ordered ranch on my own and it was delish ranch!  I would absolutely order both of those items again!   The service, however, was lacking. The bartenders were not very friendly at all and kind of gave us attitude when we were asking questions. Oy! They could have been stressed because of the crowds, so hey, who am I to judge. All in all, the service could have been friendlier.",

Also, you'd figure with such a huge investment they'd throw in a couple of misters or some working fans to the patio to cool it off but you'd be wrong.  I'll definitely come back to hang out but not if the daytime high breaks 80.    The selection of beers is good, the service is a disaster.  I don't blame the servers or bartenders.  I've had way too many at this place at this point for it to be bad luck.  There must be poor training or understaffing issues.    The food is very good.  Everything I've had has been on point.",

It was heavy, but I liked attempting to chug my beer like I was at the True Oktoberfest. They had pretty good food, but while tasty it was also DRIPPING with grease. It's hard to enjoy when you want to run to the restroom and wash your hands after each bite. There was also a food truck on the patio, that's pretty cool and it's nice they have different options - order from a server or a food truck, pick whichever bar you're closest to, I could see some major drinking holidays successfully taking place here - (think St. Patty's Day, Oktoberfest New Year's Eve and ASU games)!

The menu was a bit smaller but I think it was done well. Food came promptly and the service was perfectly adequate. The patio is very inviting with enough size to keep anyone happy.

The last person we encountered (an older guy) came over heated and without question accused me of being disorderly and kicking us out.

The manager tried to fix the situation and we hoped it would get better. The pretzel bread is out of this world but everything else was worth skipping and not worth the experience. The nachos were mostly sour cream and the cheese had an odd bitter flavor. We had 2lbs of nachos on our table untouched. None of us would eat them. I ordered a coffee and the waitress said it would take a while to brew coffee and gave the impression that it was inconvenient to her night. When the coffee arrived it was cold and old.  I also ordered a side Caesar and when the bill came, I noticed they charged me a $1 for croutons. I didn't order croutons and only 3 croutons were on my plate. We thought it was hysterical to pay .33 a crouton!!  We saw our waitress twice and literally gave her our credit card as she did a fly by. We couldn't wait to leave. With all of the choices in Arizona, we should've chosen better.   On the plus side, the bartenders are kind, funny and make great drinks. Stay at the bar and skip the food / service of the restaurant.",

I've eaten here a couple of times and I don't think I will ever again.  Most recently ordered the lobster roll, and it had fish bones in it!  Three different times I bit into bones.  The whole point of shellfish is that there are no bones, it really grossed me out.  My friend had a salad, the chicken was rubbery, and sadly most of the salad greens were not fresh, wilted.  She couldn't even finish it.  Really was not worth the $45 check, so I don't think I'll recommend it to anyone unless the go for drinks only.",

    "text": "Another review on a local brewery. Man Phoenix is really blowing up with breweries and I'm happy to see Pedal Haus being added to the mix. Not what I expected at all when I was told that a new brewery opened up on Mill ave. when I walked in I saw that the inside was very modern yet somehow kept an old school classic look. Really hard to do but PH pulled it off. What really sets this place apart is their massive beer garden/patio. Definitely one of the best patios in Phx. They have plenty of sitting areas and TVs and a nice cornhole/latter ball area and a large bar and even a smaller one towards the end of the patio. I came on a chilly day (60 degrees.lol) and they had heat lamps going as well as a very large propane outdoor fireplace with large benches to sit and enjoy your drink. Was really neat sitting so close to the open flames.   Their beer really doesn't suit my craft beer taste but I did like their guest draft list. I hope they start brewing some IPAs and more hoppy beers but that my preference. They look like they are into breweries German style beers but from the taste I had they were good.   Overall this place is really cool and a great addition to Mill ave. I really fell in love with the patio and would come here just for a drink to see it. Plus the patio is dog friendly and that gets an extra bonus star just for that!",

Crunchy and perfectly seasoned, I will  Go back for the chicken tenders alone!  Or server was quick and really friendly. He was really knowledgeable about the menu which I appreciate. He also said that they are still working on their menu and will be offering pizza soon. They have a pizza oven and everything! As if this place couldn't get any better!!",

This is including appetizers which arrived at the same time rather than before. It didn't get better when the pretzel and beer cheese, nachos, and brat all arrived completely cold. Additionally, I had ordered a green chile burger and was brought their classic burger. Then waited another 15 minutes for a new one to be brought which was also cold and undercooked. I've always ordered my burgers medium rare but that was extremely rare. The bun was straight up stale and overall had basically no flavor. I also ordered it with chips and it arrived with fries but at this point, I was done trying to fix their mess.  I will give them credit where it is due in that they discounted our meal and provided some gift cards to remedy the situation after hearing about our distaste. The pot pie my girlfriend ordered was really the only thing I found to be decent. This does not change my horrible impression of not just one fault, but a number of repeated problems. The food is just not worth the price or your time. Maybe you'll get lucky and get food that someone cared about cooking, but I won't be taking my chances again.",

The brewery is in the heart of ASU Tempe nestled behind a large apartment high rise (unofficial student housing basically) and in a really awesome location next to shops and restaurants and a short walk from Mill Ave. I probably would have spent way too much time and money here had I gone to ASU!  There's plenty of outdoor and indoor seating, cornhole and ping pong, and a sweet industrial/modern vibe. They also have a ton of domestic and craft brews on tap besides their own, and Saturday afternoon is also apparently happy hour, so everything was very reasonably priced. Probably the best part though was that they let us rent out solo cups and ping pong balls for a few games of beer pong, which I had been craving for the last couple months as I am entirely not ready to give up my delinquent college lifestyle.",

Ended up returning to Pedal Haus after the movies and was extremely disappointed. Our waitress took our orders and was never seen again. Our waters were empty for the entire night.   The fries are the nastiest fries I've ever had in my life. They tasted like plastic and was awkwardly chewy.   Go there for the drinks and games, but avoid the fries and entrees.",

    "text": "I ate here for a quick meal before heading into a movie next door.  Seeing the only 3.5-star rating, I hesitant to stop in but the convenience won me over.    There was an Arizona vs. ASU game so the place was packed to the gills with rowdy sports fans.  Luckily, I found a spot at the bar.  This whole place has ample in/outdoor bar seating, regular tables, and cabanas.    Unhindered by the crowd, a server took our order and got our beers straight away.  For dinner, I ordered the 'fancy burger' which is a mushroom & swiss variety served with thick style fried chips.  The food couldn't have been served much faster than it physically took to cook; service was extremely fast!  The burger and bun were both moist with good flavor; chips were hot and crispy.  Nothing foofoo, just solid pub food.  Complimenting the meal was their in-house, or should I say \"in-haus,\" Bourbon Barrel Aged Quad.  True to quadruple beers, it was on the dark and strong side but not in a distracting way.  Aged in Four Roses barrels, the bourbon flavor really comes through prominently.  This beer quickly became one of my all-time favorites, which drew me to eat there the next day.  The next night I ordered the half rack of ribs.  They are decent-sized pork ribs cooked in Carolina style BBQ and came with a Caesar side salad and mac & cheese.  I am generally not a fan of Carolina style but these ribs and accompanying side sauce had an elegant flavor profile (vs. the cleaning vinegar and cheap mustard tasting sauce I've had at other places).  Mac & cheese fans will enjoy the rich and creamy texture resulting from the use of real cheese here.  Being a brewery, one ought to expect that their primary focus is beer, however the food quality doesn't suffer.  Along with the fast, friendly service, the atmosphere is unique, modern, and fun.  They have plenty of TVs/sports games on and free WiFi to boot.  The only negative was that they don't sell growlers of the bourbon quad, wish they'd reconsider  I recommend this place if you're looking for an unpretentious meal and/or a good place to hang out and watch sports.",

For my main course, I ordered chicken fingers with French fries. The pieces  of chicken were huge and tasty. The dipping sauces provided were ranch, buffalo and ketchup.

We also found the service mediocre. We figured maybe they were having a bad night and went back. second time for food and drinks with friends, but had the same experience. Mediocre, overpriced bar food, not a great beer selection (they were out of prickly pear cider, too), and bare minimum service.",

We were there for happy hour which runs from 3PM - 6PM Monday - Friday (check-in on Facebook for an additional half hour - score!). My husband and I split three appetizers which were each $2 off (beer is also $2 off for happy hour). We ordered the fried cheese curds (you MUST get these - omg), the soft pretzel (deliciously salty) and the buffalo wings (also great). I had the IPA which I will definitely get again the next time we go back. It wasn't overbearingly hoppy to me and smooth for an IPA. My husband also got the Big Boots which he enjoyed. The color has a pink hue to it which I've never seen before. Pretty cool. I tried it and was expecting it to taste more sour since it's classified that way. So if you don't traditionally like sour beers you may still enjoy this one. Really looking forward to going back and trying more of their great in-house (or should I say \"in-haus\" ;)) brewed beer and yummy food.",

Went again recently and: $15 for fried chicken entree which was 1/2 of one chicken cutlet, with an ear or corn, and dried out brussel sprouts sprinkled with dry bacon. The brussel sprouts really made no sense, no flavor or even olive oil to make them palatable, but the fact that a $15 entree couldn't even come with a full breast of chicken? Most places gives you at least 1/2 a chicken when you order fried chicken. Total rip off and just so cheap and skimpy on behalf of the restaurant. Ordered the mac n cheese, which was amazing on our first visit. What we got this time was a watered down soupy mess that tasted like beer and nothing else. So disgusting and unappetizing- we asked our server to take it off the bill- which when asked they acted like they already knew it was bad. A quick \"I'm so sorry I'll take it off the bill right away\" before I could even explain what was wrong with it.  The second time we came here I figured it was just them working out the new restaurant kinks. Now they've been open for long enough to know what they're doing, and they're doing a terrible job.

They have a few different tables outside to play games, open kitchen (you can see into kitchen) a few different bars, lots of tables and TV's spread throughout. It reminds me a lot of The Yard. The only reason I give the 2 stars is very poor service. I am not sure if our server was the only one working on Sunday or if it was an off day. He was polite and tried taking care of us, it just took a very long time to get drinks and refills. I also had higher hopes on the food, the food is meh...... not a very large menu, so not a lot to choose from. I ordered the wings, nothing really fantastic about them, they also weren't horrible. My girlfriend ordered one of their burgers, but only ate half of it. Decent beer selection, obviously its a brewery, good drink deals on the weekends.

They didn't have an allergy menu but the server didn't hesitate to say what she could eat. She ordered the Asian style burger, no bun.  When she gets it she has a bite and immediately knows it has soy sauce or terrayaki (both have gluten). She began to have a reaction which lead to us leaving 2 hours before our friends due to her pain. We informed the server so he wouldn't tell others it was safe. He asked if she was okay. She said no. And he was awkward about it.   We get the bill and the food is on there and they up charged up for \"haus salad\" cause we asked for no bun. Again no apology for giving her wrong info or asking the chef. I talked to the manager, all while the server stared at me at the front of the restaurant. The manager removed the food from the bill after some hesitation. He was going to bring me the corrected bill, but ended up sending the same waiter over so that was awkward.  We had auto gratuity on the bill because our party. It was 12 bucks before the correction and 12 after. So the waiter got over 20% for bad service   We never received an apology for the whole incident. And we had to leave early cause my gf had a reaction for the night and next day.   My other group of friends (15ish) also said they experienced bad service. Long waits for drinks, being ignored.  Majority walked to the bar instead.  I'd avoid going again. Other better places in mill. I planned to reach out to the restaurant privately but they don't have a contact by email either, only if you are having a party",

The selection of beer was pretty good and tasted good too. However this is where the review goes downhill. Service was terrible not only did our waitress only check in a few times over 2 hour period. It took almost an hour to get our food with no apologies from anyone when the food was brought out. It took about another 10 minutes from our waitress to come ask how the food was. Which we ended up complaining as one of burgers ordered which was chicken was completely cold. Super gross. The only saving grace for this place was they got us a new burger and took it off the bill.

    "text": "Honestly, this is my second time coming here and it will now be my last. I dont know who is running that kitchen but for how basic their menu is it's sad they dont even know how to cook what they're offering. so let's go through their menu real quick.... the nachos were alright but they offer green chili chicken with it and there wasnt any chicken on them so we asked for more chicken. They bring us some green chili chicken soup that still barely had chicken in it, we complained but said its whatever. the manager offered to strain the chicken out but we turned down the offer because we figured that would take to long because we already have our food, what also upsets me with that is that they end up charging us for the extra chicken, even though its included in the dish, next the ribs...the first order they brought out was so dried out i dont understand how the kitchen thought it was ok to send that out to a table. I sent the ribs right back for a properly cooked rack of ribs and they were a little better but at that point I realized they just dont know how to cook. let's not forget about the dry cedar salad with the worst tasting croutons and their dry chicken wings. PEDAL HAUS, why is all your food so dry!?!??! WAIT WAIT IM NOT DONE...the manager, the very unprofessional manager thought it was cool to come over and just lean back on the table behind him. at first thought he was some random person that was about to start talking to us. he took care of my ribs for the check but BS us on the nachos with the extra chicken, we left the bill how it was and left and will not return but basically at the end of the day. Culinary Dropout has the same menu and better quality food and service with live music. just go there, it's around the corner.   P.S our server Jordin did a great job even though the food was mediocre, also this was table 202 on June 2nd, 2018 that arrived around 530.......GOOD LUCK",

Me: How long have you worked here?   Waitress: since it opened, but we've only been open a month since the remodel.  Okay...    Given the table menus give little more insight then the brand and name of beer (excluding the type of beer) don't come here unless you know what you want.  Tried the Pedal Haus in house brew: The Bourbon Barrel Aged Quad sounds great but tastes like rubbing alcohol with a hint of Carmel.   Then went for the safer Guest beer.....New Belgian Pumpkick.  Was great but you can get it anywhere.  Food was okay.  The salmon salad is cold salmon.  Egh.

Look for sponsored bar/picnic/tailgate game competitions, live (legit) bands, and really solid food and bar bites. The beer selection is diverse and they list the beers about to come out at the bottom of menus to make sure you come back.  The TV set-up for games is exceptional. And I was blown away that during the last UFC event, it was just \"on\" one of the TVs, no crazy charge at the door, even though there was also a really solid live band playing on the stage. They even have a semi-closed off banquet room if you need to host a dozen friends.  Not to be overlooked, the service here is top notice. Points to some of the bartenders (Rene, A++) which make you (a) really feel at home, (b) offer great recommendations and (c) make you want to just hang out for 4-6 hours rather than crawl to the next establishment (as so many in the area do).  Every time I am in the area, I come by PHB. No question. It never disappoints.",

I never personally played but just saw they had some games from a distance.   Their happy hour deals are pretty good, $2 off appetizers, cocktails and their house beers I believe. My favorite entree to order is the Miso Salmon Salad. I don't eat a lot of seafood because I am picky but this is really good! It's only $11 too.

I've never had a better pot pie in my life and it came out fast too!  The beer here was okay, but what was lacking was service.  The waitress did not want us there and was obviously annoyed with us.  We had been drinking, but I wouldn't say we were loud or obnoxious.  Just a small group who kept to ourselves.  Oh well, maybe this establishment prefers the tipsy folks to head elsewhere. I liked the setup of the restaurant.  The patio was really nice and was a pleasant place to hang out while enjoying a beer.  I would still come back!",

    "text": "Just went to the soft opening last night and got a personal tour with Julian (the owner) who lives by me in Tempe. I was so impressed with all the changes he made to his establishment, including some semi-private seating areas to make it easier for groups to cluster, and the most amazing redesign of the main building, including glass garage doors that slide up so the inside and outside seating can connect when the weather is nice.   As a home brewer I continue to be impressed with the in-house beers, which Julian noted would expand to about 14 on tap and they are also doing barrel aged beers. I had the quad Belgian that was barrel aged for six months and wow, it begs to be consumed while eating an appropriately luscious desert. I have also become a fan of the ESB which seems to have been adjusted since it first cam out and now it is wonderful, though I do look forward to them having their Wit beer back on tap.  Julian notes they intend to have live music on a regular basis, which they had last night, and it was amazing! You can tell he did a huge amount of work on the redesign and it shows in a place that is both unique and inviting. I can't wait to go back again, and again, and again!",

We were seeing a movie next door so decided to visit this restaurant on Fathers Day before heading next door to AMC.  We asked to sit on the patio so our kids could play corn hole and ping pong.  We were told that unfortunately no kids are allowed to play corn hole and ping pong.  We asked why and were told it's adults only 21+ in that portion of the restaurant.  We said okay and ate our lunch which was good.  Went to see the movie and upon walking by the ping pong/corn hole area on our way back to the car we are tons of kids playing corn hole and ping pong.  What the heck?  One and done at this place.",

    "text": "The place has POTENTIAL for 4-5 stars, don't read my 2 star as my final answer. The remodel looks great, and there are multiple locations throughout the establishment, inside and out, for even large groups to have semi private space. Ambience is really nice, and I would love to hang out there drinking the $3 haus drafts all day Sunday for football. The beer is \"good\", though they could have several more haus beers and beer styles to select from, as well as some guest drafts (CA / CO / OR beers). I did not try the food.  I went on week 1 of NFL, expecting the best. Unfortunately, even though there are 20-25 large screen TVs, and all (I believe) can be set to their own channels, a few of the morning games were nowhere to be found. And at the transition from am to pm games, (there were only 3 pm games) we were left with post game interviews and commercials from those games that were done. Eventually only two of the three pm games came on, one of them already several minutes into the 1st quarter. But at one point, the DirectTV feed was blacked out since the SEA / GB game was on local 10. It took several minutes, finally having to ask them to turn it back. Fans shouldn't have to ask if they can turn the game on, should be a manager dedicated to these kind of details. Give it a try. But they better get it right, soon, because you usually don't get 2nd shot at the audience. It is nestled on the interior of 7th/Mill and as I said has a great outdoor patio, even ping pong and Corn hole. Inside part is like restaurant, and there is a living room bar in back with couches and some other games.",

My dad said the fries were the best he'd ever had! Heads up they're garlicky. They gave us a very small amount of ketchup. We asked for more and were given another cup with about a spoonful of ketchup :( Overall the service was pretty rough. There was no hostess when we arrived so we sat at a table close to the door hoping to get someone's attention. After awhile we stopped a waiter passing by and asked if we could get some menus. He seemed flustered with us. He walked up to the hostess station to get menus and as he did the hostess appeared and was chewing a mouth full of something. The waiter checked on us once and seemed annoyed to do so. I understand he wasn't expecting us there but we would have been happy to move. It was also not crowded at all. Again, the food was great but it was not a very good first experience.",

I give the Blue Moon-like beer a 10 and the wieners dipped in creamy cheese a 10.

The server reassured me only the finest California avocados we used and let me tell you, when I tasted them, it was a 100% True. Come here, get beer, get food and enjoy yourself.

I'm an avid beer fan and they did not disappoint, great selection to choose from, they do not have their own beers yet, but they are getting close.  Just to call out a couple of local breweries I had the Count Hopula a blood red IPA from San Tan Brewing and I had the White Russian Imperial Stout from Sun Up Brewing.  Both were excellent and the stout is up there as one of my favorites for that style.  Last, the food - they have a basic but solid menu right now that will expand - I had the Mussels & Frites dish; awesome, may be the best mussels I've ever had, for sure they were the meatiest ones.

He is not easy to please, so this was great. That was the end of falling in love with Pedal Haus. We took our dog because it's dog friendly.  We were greeted warmly and told to sit anywhere. The minute we sat down, a very unfriendly woman came over and told us to move because only a designated area of the patio is for dogs.  I apologized and explained we'd been told to sit anywhere (as we were already moving) and she simply repeated herself and walked away.  Our server came fairly quickly and was nice enough.  We ordered two burgers and said we'd wait for happy hour to order beers (we also wanted to order an app but thought we'd wait on that, too, since they were on special).  Our burgers took 25-30 minutes!  Happy hour started in the middle of that, but our server was MIA so we couldn't put our order in for beers/apps.  When our burgers finally came out, they were pretty much rare.  I had ordered mine Med-Med Well and it was RED.  My husband ordered his medium and it was pink all the way throughout.  The buns were cold (I assume they are served that way, but not my preference). Because we were starving at this point, we didn't complain about the burgers and ordered wings and a beer. The wings came out in about 2 minutes. I kid you not.  Almost a half an hour for burgers that weren't even cooked, and yet the wings in 2 minutes. Well, that's because they weren't cooked, either! They were cold, and clearly not cooked in the sauce, but rather the sauce thrown over top.  Again, I suppose that is how they serve them here, but definitely not my preference. No taste whatsover, and cold.  The side salad I got in place of fries was a few pieces of lettuce with a 2 cucumbers and 2 radish slices. Odd.  We were already so annoyed and disappointed in our experience, that I wasn't about to pay for wings we couldn't/wouldn't eat.  I let the server know and she was very apologetic.  Our service was kind, but clearly overworked in a completely different section (since we were way in the dog area of the \"dog friendly\" patio) and therefore not attentive.  Throughout this entire time there was someone there who I assume was a manager because he had a \"uniform\" on but wasn't waiting tables. He was standing around the entire time and never helping his server or checking in. Class act.  I took pictures of the burgers so you know I'm not exaggerating, but they are on my husband's phone and honestly they are just plain gross. As I'm reviewing this, I can't believe we ate them. :(  Oh...and no parking validation, either.",

The server completely forgot to put in ALL the appetizers so we never received them. The truffle fries have no difference from the regular fries, aside from some week old cilantro thrown in top and served cold on top of it. Nashville chicken is nothing even comparable to the real deal. Went with a work group and overall not a good experience. Don't recommend.",

Tonight we tried the wings, shishito peppers, hummus, and the Thai Peanut Steak Salad! Everything was great! I am addicted to the Shishito Peppers! This is our second visit in just over a month!

I also can't say enough about the pretzels with haus mustard, and beer cheese, YUM! This time around I paired it with the Biere Blanche although I almost got the Pilsner to complete the German effect. They really have a great menu, something for meat lovers and vegetarians alike. The wait staff and bartender were equally as impressive and friendly.   Side note, the parking is a bit particular and your best bet is the nearby parking garage (make sure to use the Hanover parking garage for an hour of validated parking, the other parking garage lot cannot be validated here.) Otherwise all nearby parking is metered on a busy street. Better yet, if you can ride your bike (get it, Pedal Haus) even better!",

I didn't realize you could mess up nachos, but Pedal Haus really did. The green Chile is decent and the cheese just doesn't go with it, such a weird combo. The pictures are better than the actual taste  the loaded cheese fries are the same way, soaked in sauce, totally overdid it with that. Sometimes less is more. Wouldn't recommend the pizza to anyone. Hummus is pretty good, and fried chicken salad is good, I subbed for the roasted chicken and it was very weird. I would get it without any chicken. The silo area is awesome, but the hi top chairs are horrible with the back rests hanging on for dear life. Really need to make some tweaks to the menu, and practicality of the restaurant because it has so much potential.   If you go, get the dessert!! If I go back I'll definitely order that, no sense in overpaying for the other stuff.",

I am always leery going anywhere in downtown Tempe, but I had to make this long awaited visit happen. My appetite consisted of a Bavarian Pretzel, accompanied with beer cheese and Smashed Guacamole with chips. I did really like how fresh the flavors tasted and how filling an appetizer meal can actually be. To compliment my meals I went with a dark stout. The stout was amazing and filled with intense flavors that I appreciate. I did not catch the name of the beer, but have posted the image if that helps. The overall ambiance was amazing, great outdoor space filled with outdoor games. The inside area of the bar was spacious and the aroma of the hops were savoring.",

We waited and waited and waited and our drink never arrived. We waiting for about 25 minutes before we had to give up and just left. I am a person who will always give the benefit of the doubt.

It was cooler than usual outside and I settled in with the Haus IPA which was very satisfying and pretty fruity.  I bet this will be a star attraction on steamy summer nights.  I ordered an a full order of wings and a side of fries and sipped away while I waited.  After a short wait, voila, wings and fries appeared before me.  The wings had a great smoke flavor to them but I found the sauce to be lacking/sparse.  The fries were unseasoned and bland but if you put enough ranch on them they were serviceable.  I left satisfied but the real star was the beer, in my opinion.  For wings and fries, I will stick to another joint on Mill most of the time, but this is a solid backup.",

    "text": "Pedal Haus Brewery is a large and modern brewery and restaurant located in downtown Tempe near the AMC theater. This restaurant sells a combination of their own beer, guest taps, and several full bars. Parking is not available at the restaurant, but there are several garages in the area and using Lyft is probably a better option.  We were here for my 20th high school reunion and dominated the back patio with over 100 guests. The layout of the brewery is a bit odd with several indoor rooms and patio style rooms that are both inside and outside. Nestled among the dining areas are the brewing equipment and a large pizza oven.  Our group was treated to a heavy appetizer buffet including sliders, pasta dishes, and house made potato chips. The menu seems to be standard pub food dominated by typical dishes like burgers, pizza, and mac and cheese. The food was decent, although I may have chosen more aggressive items if it was not catered.  As you would expect, the drinks were flowing. I sampled a few of their house beers which were good. The guest taps were a bit more interesting with different styles. The mixed drinks were pretty typical, but I have sympathy for the bartenders dealing with dozens of guests more interested in the last 20 years than their drink orders.  The overall feel is sort of eclectic and modern hipster with a sprawling location. Pedal Haus is a decent place to take a large group as they can cater to a broad range of tastes. The location is great, especially for visiting ASU parents or even locals looking to meet up with new friends.",

    "text": "Not a place I'd go back to. Why? Service and employees were just weird. I walked up from the park area, approached the hostess. There were a ton of seating options from firepit comfy seating to the uncomfortable bar area. I asked if they offer flights, and I assume the hostess assumed that I wasn't interested in eating or relaxing and she pointed me to the bar. As it turns out, considering the uncomfortable high stools and at least one of the bartenders, the bar should be the last place that the hostess should've sat me at.   They have Four Roses Bourbon Barrel aged beer! I thought I was sold. After the first and horrible bartender asked if I wanted a food menu but never delivered, I should've left after I finished my beer. Buuut, I asked for a menu. Then, guess what? I asked if I could place my order. Don't worry though, she catered to the couple who sat across the bar from me, so not everyone gets bad service.   I finally ordered the fried pickles. They consisted of spears and hamburger slice kosher dill pickles in a smooth batter and came with a side of ranch. Not the best fried pickles I've had, but not the worst.   A lot of items featured on pictures on Yelp are no longer offered. For example, the mussels, don't set your heart on them. And the happy hours have changed. I'm not sure if it's a common change up, but the Wednesday that I was there, happy hour was Monday-Saturday 3-6:30. During Happy hour, it's $2 off Pedal Haus Beers, but guess what? That didn't include the barrel aged beer nor did she tell me that until later. It also includes $5 glasses of wine. I noticed the healthy pours of wine, so if that's your thing, it's a good deal. $5 margaritas, $2 off well drinks and $2 off appetizers. They also have all day Happy Hour on Sundays, but those specials are a little different.",

And we would understand if they were super busy and there were plenty of people waiting before and after us but there was a couple that sat down a few minutes after we did and they asked if they needed anything and still blew us off. They purposely went straight to them and turned away from our direction and left again. Not sure if it's because we're hispanic since everyone else there wasn't but they sure made it seem that way when they helped everyone around us and not one bartender bothered to help us.",

We saw the silo down a side street and came in for a closer look. We wish we would have found Pedal House sooner. A lot of shaded outdoor seating and great selection of $3 craft beers and cocktail specials for Sunday afternoon. We had the wings to go with our Kolsch and Marzen beers and took our time enjoying the atmosphere and the attention that the staff lavished on us. All was delicious. Thank you, Mike, for being so helpful to a couple of tourists who stumbled on a gem. We will be back next year!",

They only sell beer by the pint whereas most breweries give you a few size options to allow you to taste more beers (this is a minimal complaint). I will be back!",

I ordered a Jameson on the rocks and it came back watery which meant it was shaken. No big deal because I asked for my second Jameson on the rocks not shaken which is what I prefer. The fried pickles were really good and the caesar salad was kind of okay. I really wished they had the nachos! What made me disappointed was the fact that my Jameson drinks had an up charge of 1.50$ for being \"on the rocks.\" So basically an extra 3$ added to the tab because I had ice in my Jameson. To me I think this is ridiculous, I have never seen this before and it doesn't make sense to up charge this. IF I come back, I will have to ask about the certain up charges.",

If you like great service, tasty eats, modern/chic motif,  and most importantly delicious beer, then this is a mandatory stop on an ever-groundhogish-Mill Street. This microgastrobrew is a breath of fresh air, and a very welcomed one at that.   Be forewarned, if you come when the brew master is hard at work, you'll probably want to sit outside unless the smell doesn't bother you and/or your companion. Just remember that it'll all be worthwhile once you get a taste of the sweet sweet nectar at Pedal Haus Brewery.

Not only were they out of their own IPA, they had beers listed that they have not carried for 3 months now.

The space itself is very open and inviting. It's getting a bit too toasty for patio seating but their patio looks amazing!   I ordered the Rose Royale {Hendricks Gin | Haus  made sweet & sour | fresh raspberries | Champagne} it was the perfect refresher after an hour of paddle boarding on the lake. For an appetizer we went with the nachos and holy moly they are HUGE! So big I actually thought about cancelling my main course. Honestly, these were some of the best nachos ever! I consider myself a nacho connoisseur (seriously it should be on my resume). These do not disappoint! The generous toppings of chicken chili verde, black beans, corn, queso, pickled Fresno peppers, and lime crema made it almost impossible to stop eating. I showed a little more restraint and ordered the Haus Salad composed of mixed greens, tomato, cucumber, red onion, feta, and balsamic vinaigrette. Pretty standard but still good. As always I could use more feta. I also was able to try a bite of the green chili bacon burger. It was much more satisfying than my salad! I don't normally order burgers but I would consider it here! The green chili and Jack cheese combo was to die for!   Service was ok. At first it was really quick and efficient but toward the end we found ourselves waiting for the check for a good 10-15 min. That was my only gripe. If I find myself in the area again i would definitely come back!",

We decided to give it a second chance and we will never come back. They completely changed their menu there is one German item on it. If you enjoy eating a half melted block of cheese on top of a soggy flatbread, this is the place for you. I ordered the my boy bleu burger and they brought me the fancy burger. I ordered my burger medium and when they brought the correct burger it was a hockey puck. So. Overcooked. The bun was three days old and falling apart. It's a shame because their beers are on point but their food is so beyond subpar it's ridiculous. They have such a high turnover of staff, there is not a single employee we've seen more than once here unlike our normal spots, so there is definitely something up.",

We went for drinks at happy hours (3-6pm weekdays) on a Friday and the place was completely packed. They have an incredible outdoor space complete with a of couple corn hole sets. A great option for hanging out with coworkers or friends after work.  I had the Farmhouse Ale and the  Koffee Kolsch.   The Farmhouse Ale was light and smooth. It touts an impressive ABV at 10%. For a $4 happy hour price, you can't go wrong.   The real highlight was the Koffee Kolsch. Holy smokes. It was SO good. The smell was incredibly enticing and aromatic. Sometimes that's where the flavor profile ends, but not with this beer. The coffee flavor was near exquisite. I wish I had gotten two of these! I'll definitely be looking for it in stores, because OH MY GOD IT'S SO GOOD.",

I was able to quickly place my order, but prior to receiving my Kolsch the bartender asked for a card to hold and before even waiting for a response he was off.  When I received my beer is was asked again for a card, but once again he left before I could respond.  My beer was at least 1 1/8\" below full upon arrival.  At first I thought ok maybe they serve all of their beers not quite full, but then the person three bar stools to my right got a completely full beer.  A short time later my side arrived (Brussels and Bacon) and for a third time I was asked for a card at which time I held up my $20 since I intended to pay with cash.  The bartender took my cash and vanished yet again returning with a cash drawer to add to his register.  While he was gone I experienced very over cooked mildly burnt dry Brussels and almost no bacon or bacon flavor.  The bartender then returned with my change (He gave me two 5's and a single) 11 bucks change from a twenty and dropped of the receipt which showed a total including tax of $10.81, so I did a double take and discovered I was undercharged.  I got his attention and showed him the receipt and the change; he thanked me for being honest and pointing it out.  He disappears again to get the \"right change\" only to return with a five spot and four singles I know it's only .19 but damn get it right.  Long story short the BEER was descent the FOOD was horrible and be prepared to give them a card or cash right away.  If you do pay in cash don't expect the change to be correct.",

I ordered a Belgian beer and my friend ordered a margarita. Both were very tasty. It was a nice evening after the DC Wonder Woman 10k. Here's the hard part. We ordered the 'haus specialty' chicken pot pie. It was a perfect portion and tasted great. Perhaps a fluke, but my friend and I both got sick that evening.",

    "text": "First impressions:  It looks like a really cool Brewery!  It's very large, has TVs almost everywhere in the place, and was the perfect vibe for our hungover Sunday brunch.  Got a seat right away and the interior was pretty empty.  Food: Ok. I got the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich, which was tasty and I ate every bite. So I can't complain. But they loaded it with condiments, so my bottom bun was drenched and my plate had a pool on it! Again, ate it all, but it was a little overkill. The fries were ok. My wife got a wedge salad and asked to remove a few ingredients, they didn't listen or it didnt get back to the kitchen because she had to pick out everything from her salad. Again, not the end of the world. But the salad was not great.  We make better salads at home.   Drinks: This was the painful one for me.  The drinks were overall underwhelming.  I had a Bloody Mary and it was very average. But I had the Mexican Amber and it has a weird metallic aftertaste. It wasn't good. My wife had the Blanche and it was the best one! Recommend that one.  Service: spotty. They would disappear, which wouldn't be a problem for us if they were slammed, but there was nobody inside. We asked for tasters (of the Amber ale) and that should signal we are about to order a beer. Took 5-10 for the sampler to come and then another 15 mins for someone to come back so we could order. I'd pass on the Amber btw. Go with the Blonde Blanche.  Not sure we would go back sadly.",

First impression was that of a fun, lively place. This establishment has a fantastic patio! The waitstaff was extremely attractive as well. The atmosphere was that of, \"light industry/factory/warehouse.\" It was clean and interesting.  Our waitress, though very attractive, messed up our appetizer and salad dressing choices. I was thinking, \"wow, she screwed up twice, good thing she's hot\". After I told her about each issue, she offered immediately to fix both, and did. I respected her for that. *Side note: \"Looks fade; your heart and soul matter the most.\" Just because someone is hot DOES NOT mean you want to spend the REST OF YOUR LIFE with them! Think about it GUYS!  We DID have +fantastic+ Reuben sandwiches - best I've had in years! I would go back JUST for those sandwiches! Our appetizer was delicious, but the salads that came with our sandwiches were tasteless; as if they had NO dressing at all. I lodged a complaint, but I doubt it will matter.  For the record, the Phoenix area/ASU has a ton of hot women. The problem is, some or a lot of them, \"fake the funk\"- they just don't care about service while working as wait staff. This brewery is near ASU so there you go. Though most non-religious college guys just want to get laid, and don't care about service, I understand the brewery's marketing approach.",

Also I found their drinks and food to be a bit overpriced and overcooked to the point of greasy. There are too many great places to enjoy downtown Tempe that I won't be trying this place again",

We were expecting a giant crowd during this time of the year, however, we were pleasantly surprised to see that the environment was relaxing. As tradition goes, it is customary to have \"steins\" of beer at this event, and so we did. And the beer was good! I was initially skeptical of ordering food here as well, especially during this event, but we eventually did order food towards the evening, and were pleasantly surprised yet again! We ordered burgers, pasta and pot pies, and ALL of them were great. The evening was followed by some friendly competitions like the stein holding event and the sausage eating race, which were conducted in a very orderly manner. The people were friendly, service was prompt, the games section is well maintained, and the waitresses were polite - leading to a great overall experience! :-)",

I love the patio and look forward to returning with my cycling buddies for our bike and beer rides. The staff was very attentive and nice. I give it a 4 because the burgers will determine if I raise it to a 5. But the Poutine my friend let me grab a bite of was out of this world! The flavor profiles for the items were on point!

My lobster roll wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't memorable. I'll be trying something different next time. Plenty of beer choices and the staff is friendly. Great place to go with a large group to watch sports games. You have many choices as far as what kind of seating arrangements: outdoor bar, indoor bar, regular tables,  patio furniture, open style seating, etc. Outdoor games and activities as well! Lots of outside seating but there are plenty of space heaters to keep you toasty. Overall recommend for large groups looking for a spot to hang out for a few hours.",

There's a large outdoor patio and also a nice indoor seating area. When we walked in we were greeted and seated in the back. We got our drink orders in quickly (we all opted for the pedal hause beers). They arrived quickly. I got the nitro and it was honestly bland and flat. Would not recommend.   When we went to order our food we were informed that 2 of the 4 burgers were no longer available (8pm on a Saturday night). Considering the menu was pretty small, it was disappointing. I ordered the chicken pot pie. I figured it must be the signature dish bc it had a spot all on its own on the menu. My friends ordered the steak frites, and mushroom and asparagus pasta. My vegetarian friend was disappointed w the lack of options. Literally salad or the pasta. She asked if they had any veggie burgers and the waitress said they have turkey burgers at lunch. It seems weird that in 2015 restaurants (especially in a liberal college town) don't carry veggie patties as a burger alternative.  That being said, all of our food was delicious. My pot pie was crisp and fluffy on top with warm highly seasoned chickeny goodness inside. I totally get why it has its own place on the menu. I gave their in house brews another try with the porterhause. Perfect dark beer, they redeemed themselves.  All in all I would definitely come back. It's a festive, quick, and convenient place w pretty yummy food. They had a big apps menu that I would love to try next time.",

So me and my bf eat keto so we come here and order wings with their buffalo sauce, shishito peppers, side salad, and the roasted Brussels sprouts and we add a fried egg on top because WE LOVE EGGS! Haha anyway the last time we were here we ordered the usual and my bf took a bite of one of the wings and it was sweet. If you're unfamiliar with keto it means we eat very little carbs, high fat, and absolutely no sugar. So we flagged down the manager and let him know the buffalo sauce was sweet. He said there was no sugar in the recipe but that he'd check with the kitchen, he came back and said there was no sugar, but that if we thought they tasted sweet that he'd switch them out for us. We put the first wings aside and they took them away. The manager then came back and told us they tried the wings and they were indeed sweet, someone had messed up the recipe for the buffalo sauce! We knew we weren't crazy!  anyway, we are so thankful because they made it right for us. We love Pedal Haus",

I sat at the bar and the service was very good.  The cheddar burger with fries was satisfactory but I'll probably try something different on my next visit.  I think they are still working on their beer list.  They didn't have any of their own beers and the big craft brewers like Sierra Nevada, Four Peaks and I believe it was New Belgium dominated the tap list.  I did like my Dragoon IPA and hope they continue to broaden their offerings with smaller unique brewers.",

    "text": "We have come to bring down the Haus.   Pardon me.   This is a long overdue review for a brewery that we have known about for at least a year. This is, in every sense, a cool establishment. It is located next to the AMC nestled in Downtown Tempe, a central hub of stores, bars, and restaurants alike. Pedal Haus sits upon a good spot with both indoor and outdoor seating; the circular outdoor arrangements are well-shaded and blessed with steady mist on the hot days. For today, we went inside.  We were hangry, so getting the layout was out of the question. I had but one destination: the table upon which food and drink appeared. Our server was quick to take our orders and remained attentive and helpful throughout. As Happy Hour was still going on, I ordered a slightly discounted staple from the Haus itself: German Pilsner (5.7% ABV), just something to cool off and gently infiltrate my bloodstream. It was perfect for this occasion, light and crisp, and there are many alternatives on their impressive menu of libations.   For food, we ordered the Bavarian Pretzels and a White Truffle Mushroom Pizza to share. Let us begin with the pretzels -- I greatly enjoyed them. It is only slightly irksome that they are prepared in threes; I am more compelled by the voluminous side of Haus Beer Cheese, along with the small but powerful side of mustard. The pretzels are gregariously buttered and salted, so expect a savory starter if you go with this option. The pizza was \"eh\" -- a fond but unremarkable memory of tasty, herby flatbreads on greasy parchment paper. Still, these meals stood no chance against our appetites. They were good (very good with the beer).  A note about indoor seating, which we believed was more fitting for our dinner: LOUD NOISES. The interior is noisy because the music is loud. I can do without the background cacophony; without it, we would be chatting with our company and would greatly minimize the instances of, \"What?!\" or \"Huh??\" from two feet away.   All of this accounted for, I am pleased to have at last crossed Pedal Haus off the list. Because of the lack of easy accessibility (I turn my back on paid parking structures most of the time), a sequel is a respectable ways away. However, it is satisfying to know that the food and drink they... pedal here will not disappoint when we return (did you get it? Oh, sue me). In an effort to preserve our vocal cords, we will plan on outdoor seating for next time.",

    "text": "I visited with my girlfriend and another couple on a Saturday evening, arriving at 5pm. We came here because it is one of the \"dinner and a show\" options that give a discount if you are seeing a show at Gammage in Tempe.   We were seated promptly when we arrived, as we had a reservation. Unfortunately, it took about 15 minutes for a server to greet us once we were seated. We watched many servers walk past us with no acknowledgement that were sitting there with no service. We ordered drinks, which came to our table about 10 minutes later.   We then ordered the Brussel sprouts and goat cheese appetizer, which came out fairly quickly and was very good. It was sweet and perfectly cooked.  For dinner, I ordered the buttermilk chicken dinner. I received the buttermilk chicken salad instead. When we told the server, he apologized but did not offer to replace it with the correct entree. The salad was decent, but it was a bit of disappointment, as it was not what I ordered.  One of our party ordered grilled onions with her classic burger, which did not come out with the order. She told the food runner, who said he would be right back with them, and he never came back.   The \"dinner and a show\" discount was supposed to be $1 house beers. We ordered a total of 3 beers. We notified the server after ordering the 3rd beer to make sure that we would receive the discount. He advised that they would only apply the discount on one drink per table, not per ticket stub as it says on the website.  The restaurants' website also states they will give $2 off the tab to cover the first hour of parking. When we presented our 2 stubs from the parking garage (1 per couple), he said it was only 1 per table.   We spoke to the manager and explained our somewhat unpleasant experience. He was apologetic and promptly offered to resolve it. He returned with a new tab, that was cut in half.   I am not one that normally complains, as I understand the plight of restaurants trying to satisfy their customers. We were not expecting a 50% discount, we just wanted what we ordered and a few bucks off a few beers and $4 off for parking.   Overall this is a decent place for a meal and drinks. The pricing is good for the quality and quantity of food you receive, but the service is not great. It seems as though the management is aware, and they are doing what they can to make people happy. They should work on training their servers regarding policies and speed of service to improve.",

I have visited them before and their other appetizers were not too bad.   The service was pretty decent, but since the restaurant was open to the outside, it felt quite humid inside the restaurant. Also, the inside of the restaurant was pretty noisy. I had trouble hearing other people at my table. I think that the acoustics wasn't very good in the area in which we were seated.

The outdoor covered seating arrangement is beautiful to look at and are all equipped with misters for the AZ heat. Outdoor classic games like bag toss. There is a gorgeous water structure in front of the brewery with giant rabbits that make for a perfect Instagram photo op!   They're a scratch kitchen, so everything is unique and fresh. So far I have tried the nachos, Mac and cheese, and wings. I did see some tasty burgers pass me by too. Their portion sizes are generous, so come hungry. I like the wings the best so far, so much flavor, plus they are smoked then fried making them crispy yet tender.   Service is friendly, pricing is a little higher than average, but it is made up for in the amount of food they give you. We had a $65 tab after ordering 2 alcohol drinks and 3 food items.   Only thing I don't like about this place is the bathroom setup. The men and women's restrooms are only for toileting. The handwashing station and vanity mirrors are communal and  located outside in the common area. Kind of a bummer when you have braces like me and need to pick at your teeth and swish/gargle in private lol   All in all, I love the feel of this place and you will see all ages. It seems like a versatile place to hang out and have fun with friends and family, or a laid back date.",

The only weird thing about it, which isn't really a big deal just different - is that after you use the bathroom you have to exit the bathroom to wash your hands in the basin provided outside of it, right by the brewery area. It's always neat to walk by and check out the brewery though.  The beers we had were good, and we will definitely be back to check out the food. So far, we are impressed.",

The place offers some excellent craft beers and snacks to go along While drinking or snacking, you'll find plenty of bar and patio games to keep your hands occupied. Out of all the places in the Mill Avenue District, Pedal Haus has got to be one of my favorites",

    "text": "So I've been coming to this place a lot more since I became a member of the AMC Plus next door. They have a decent selection of beers and have a perfect happy hour time. I haven't had any food here but I'm always seeing people ordering food and it looks rather delicious. It's also great for small and group settings.   My favorite part about this place is that they have ping pong and bags. Since it's been rather hot outside, me and literally anyone i go with has free range on the games which has brought me back.   Also, the vibe of this place is really cool. The lighting is dim and intimidate. It would be a great place for a date since the music isn't very loud at all. And i know it's been hot but they do have misters that make the heat more bearable which is nice. I highly suggest coming to this spot for a drink before or after a movie.",

I can give this place a try again in the future but I hope I can eat warm chicken.",

School was out, so it was pretty empty about 11:30 AM, so I sat right down at one of the outdoor bar stools. I saw 2 prices on the menu, 5/9, I asked what the difference was and they said you can get a beer for 5 bucks or a 1 liter stein for $9. 9 please!  I ordered an IPA and it was solid and fruity and I got another stein of one of their pale ales.   Great beer, cool glasses, great service and I got a few free stickers.  Five stars all around.  No food this time, but it was a great hour experiencing Mill Street again after more than 2 decades.",

I will break it down as best as I can.  Decor: The brewery has an amazing set up with indoor, outdoor seating. The outdoor seating also includes firepits for larger groups, which is the best attraction for me as a consumer. They have an adult play area with cornhole and ping pong tables. Inside they have a pizza oven where you can see everything being cooked. I LOVED this, it really drew attention to the kitchen.  Food: Ok, so I'm not gonna lie, I went all out. I wanted nachos like it's nobodies business. They had a 2lb nacho, and good god was it good. They queso, the green chile chicken, the everything omg. So that was a great start. Then we ordered the philly cheesesteak, and a couple drinks. The cheesesteak was honestly made amazingly. They used cheese spread, WHICH IS LEGIT. The only thing I would've loved to have was sauted peppers as well. Otherwise, the kitchen knows damn well how to make some amazing food!  Customer Service: The place was super busy that night, and granted our server was around, but we would've liked to be helped a little more. I had to walk around and find help on multiple times, which was a little annoying, but I need the exercise.",

    "text": "We will most definitely be back to this place.   We encountered a couple of problems however they did fix everything they possibly could.   Let's start off with the service. Our waitress Taylor was very attentive even with all of the tables she had.  She did ask us if it was our first time here and we advised her it was however she didn't tell us of any specials or that it was happy hour so that was a bummer. I would have most definitely tried other items if I would have known. But again, she was so nice, very friendly, and did make us laugh.   Now the food and drinks. The chicken wings were soooooo good! We had the bbq wings and the buffalo wings with a side of fries. Our first order was incorrect however they corrected it immediately which was very nice to see.  The chicken wings were very juicy and cooked perfectly. Probably one of the best order of wings I've had down mill ave.  The fries... oh the fries... please bring a breath mint if you order them. Although they were delicious I could not get over how strong the garlic smell was. I literally had to put it at the edge of the table.   The margarita was also one of the best I've had. It was consistent! Normally down on mill you can't really get consistent drinks unless it's wine, beer, or frozen margaritas. My boyfriend tried 3 different types of beer and he really liked it.   The atmosphere is great! You have the option of sitting outside or inside and of course with the nice weather there was a wait to sit outside. It was a little hot and a little dark inside but overall a great atmosphere as well. This wasn't your typical mill ave place. It was an \"older\" crowd but a fun one which was very nice to see.   The reason for 4 stars is bc they do not have dessert. It's on the menu but they don't have any. I ordered some and the waitress came back and informed me they didn't have any and that they don't really sell dessert here. This for sure would have been a 5 star rating if they did.   Overall, it was a wonderful experience and we will make this a regular spot for sure.",

As I walked in, I saw a cool outdoor patio area where you can have a circular booth with friends and have a conversation or regular tables. The cool thing was that the had the mister going on outside since it was really hot.   So I got the Biere Blanche since it's local and went with the Falafel Burger. Let me take a few bites and let you know how it went .......  Garlic fries were a great addition to the burger and the fries didn't taste like you could get them just at any store. I was surprised by the taste of the Falafel Burger and it was pretty amazing. The condiments and garnishment was on point. 5 stars for the hostess, the waitress, the food and the atmosphere!",

    "text": "I grew up in Tempe and remember when Islands was at this location and then it sat empty for some time after it closed. But is looks like Tempe finally found a winner in Pedal Haus. It is a locally owned brewpub that features handcrafted European-style beers along with a Belgian-American gastropub menu. They opened in 2015 and just recently went through a renovation. They have some pretty creative dishes like brisket ragu pasta, lobster mac & cheese, tempura-fried cheese curds and moules frites. You can't miss this place because it is huge. They have three bar areas with an enormous patio (with cornhole) and beer garden. I was first introduced to Pedal Haus on a food tour of Tempe last year and happy to finally make a return visit. I started my day off with the Bavarian pretzel which comes with sides of beer cheese, stone-ground mustard and a maple butter. The pretzels are shaped liked a baguette and come served warm and soft. The maple butter was a pleasant surprise. Then I got the Green Chili Bacon Burger which is a pretty good-sized burger loaded with all types of flavor. I'm an ale guy and enjoyed their amber ale for my beer choice. One fun fact that I found interesting is that they recycle heat in the brewing process. The steam (which is typically lost) is distributed to a hot water tank that warms up the next batch. They have a killer happy hour that offers reduced prices on their appetizers and beer. Like many of the new breweries opening up, they are pet friendly, so feel free to bring your dog.",

Albeit, the place is huge, but there were probably only five or tables that were filled.   I ordered the Green Chili Burger [$13], and we shared the Pub Deviled Eggs [$6]. The burger was pretty good; the meat was juicy and the bread was nice and big. I asked for the haus slaw. For the price, it's probably smaller than what it was worth. The location is nice, and I love the decor (the whole bicycle theme going on). The deviled eggs were deviled eggs, nothing different from what you probably had at a friend's house.   The service was spectacularly slow. The food was good, nothing too special, but had everything else been going right, then I wouldn't mind going to Pedal Haus to meet with friends and have grub here. However, the waitress who was assigned to our table was so busy with the other restaurant goers that we remained forgotten for the most part. The place wasn't that busy either, so I'm not sure what was going on.   In conclusion, if a friend suggests this place, okay, I'll go, but I don't see myself actively seeking this place out to have lunch.",

We did not get an apology for the bad service out of Allison's mouth nor a thank you after she dropped off the bill.   Thanks for my first visit at the Pedal!",

So we made a reservation for a Friday evening.   We were seated in the middle of the silo and the music was so loud - my grandparents thought so and even I, a college student, agreed. I literally got a headache. Then our food took an hour to come because of a 30-person party before us. The waitress was super nice and apologetic and the manager came out and said he'd cover our first round of drinks.   Finally when our food came my family enjoyed theirs but I was disappointed with my lobster mac n cheese - first of all, they gave me bacon mac n cheese which I identified immediately and told the server, who assured me it was lobster. I thought the customer was always right? Anyway, I finally convinced him that it wasn't in fact lobster and they gave me what I ordered. It was soupy and bitter. Not a fan.   Throughout this my grandparents were very amicable and understanding but it got to a point where we were tired of waiting and HUNGRY.   We paid for our drinks, the manager ended up paying for our meals (I swear I saw him shaking his head as we walked away), and we tipped the poor waitress well.   Probably won't return. Sad because I liked it the first time!",

The noise level on a Saturday night was not too bad and a nice conversation was possible.  The crowd was surprisingly not all ASU students, and in fact, there was a good mix of age groups.  There is a nice patio plus indoor seating.  One other thing I should mention about Saturday nights here--they offer a Saturday happy hour until 6:30pm.  That's a nice perk considering most places in the Mill Ave. area don't offer weekend happy hours.   The beers and the food were excellent.  I had the half beer can chicken and it was done perfectly.  I can't wait to go back as there were several more beers  and entrees I want to try.",

After our beer order got taken within 10 minutes we had to wait 20 minutes before our waiter returned...after us asking another waiter to get him. Our waiter, when he returned told us that he would \"be right back.\"  While taking our food order I asked if the Pretzel and Cheese appetizer would come out sooner than the entree and he said he could get it out right away. After 15 minutes passed without him returning we waved him down to ask for an ETA on the food and he responded with \"the kitchens too far to go check.\" Another 5 minutes passed and we waved him down again...he said \"our kitchens getting shit on I can't really tell you when the food will come out.\"  A few minutes later he brought me a cold pretzel and cheese which led me to believe he was just too lazy to get it from the kitchen that was \"too far\" when it was ready.  At this point I cancelled my entree order, paid my tab and left. I honestly regret paying ~$9 for my beer and cold appetizer and regret tipping the waiter $.50.   He was an awful waiter and it was an overall awful experience. If management reads this: he was wearing a green tank top on St Pattys Day around 9pm and working the outside area. Firing him would improve your business.",

I cannot begin to express the gratitude of the family, friends, and co-workers of the deceased who were all invited to attend the reception immediately following the funeral service. Not only did Pedal Haus close down to the general public for 3 hours to give the funeral party privacy, but they also catered all of the food at no cost. I know it was a great relief to the family, both financially and emotionally, to be relieved of the burden of planning and hosting a reception during such a difficult time. Pedal Haus is a wonderful local business who should be promoted and praised for their generosity and kindness during this unimaginably difficult time.",

Pedal house is perfect for an afternoon meal as well as a fun night out with all your friends. You could say I'm somewhat of a buffalo wing connoisseur and the wings here are with out a doubt the best I have ever had. They are seasoned in such a way that they don't even need the amazing house made buffalo sauce but then again the buffalo sauce is so good you have to have it with your wing. They have the perfect crisp on the outside and the meat is super tender and juicy! I rarely use the side of ranch always provided with an order of wings but even that is delectable. To top it all off the celery salad is a great new take on the veggies you usually get with wings. For a main course you must have the chefs cut steak... The best steak I have ever had is not an over exaggeration! Just think of the steak of you're dreams and that's what I ate. This place rules.",

    "text": "So we stopped in to have a few beers on a Sunday afternoon, and I gotta say I was impressed. The beer was delicious. They look very clean and everything is new. This would have gotten 5 stars as a fist timer here, but the bartender kept 1 of those.... I'm new to these breweries and i'm used to my Coors Light. So when I walk into a place like this it sucked that the bartender was acting like a snob. My friend and I asked a couple question and I swear he acted like he was disgusted that we didn't know everything about the beers.  Maybe he had a crazy Saturday night and partied with Snoop Dogg and Dre, and spent his early morning flying back from the huge party that they had on their Yacht in Miami, where Alf and the a Kardashian made a guest appearance, or maybe he just got hammered in his Apt with his old frat friends... Either way he looked miserable and was being snobby, we would have probably stayed there for another couple rounds instead of walking across the street to another bar if it wasn't for him. We'd def. be willing to try it again though. I wont let a beer snob between me and my sweet, delicious beer.",

The egg roll was phenomenal.  Their beer selection was also solid, multiple local breweries to Arizona which always a plus in any state I visit.

Only saw her when she was taking our order or bringing our food or drinks.  Didn't check up on us or replenish the water.  The atmosphere is lively.  It's very close to the ASU campus so there is a lot of college kids here.  A lot of TVs with sports playing.  One thing I liked is that the sinks are outside the bathrooms.

The burger and salads were good and the beer was cold, but there are a few things they could work on. First, expand the menu. I thought the lunch menu was limited, but since I wanted a cheeseburger I didn't mind.   When I came back with another group for dinner, the dinner menu was the same limited lunch menu! Odd, right? I tried one of the salads and it was good sized and tasted fresh, but the people dining with me were disappointed with the narrow selection. One guy was visiting from the Midwest and wants bacon on everything, but he couldn't get bacon on his burger. The waiter said the only bacon they had was wrapped around the olives and pre-made. I ask you, how can a restaurant not have bacon available for a hamburger?  Maybe they'll expand the menu as they get more experienced, but that was the only knock on this place. The servers were friendly and quick, the food and beer tasted good, and the atmosphere was relaxed and casual. That's a win in my book.",

One friend had the chicken wings and the other had the brat bites while I had the poutine. All 3 dishes were really underwhelming. The chicken wings and brat bites didn't really have any flavor. The poutine was pretty good but it took a long time to get to the table (it was slammed... ASU vs. uofa). Hopefully they figure out a better menu cause the environment is pretty awesome.",

I really enjoyed my $5 glasses of wine...a little disappointed that they ran out of cider, but a nice glass of wine will always make up for that.  We tried the pretzel and the brat bites - thumbs up on the pretzel with beer cheese, but thumbs down on the brat bites - tasted like they had been sitting out way too long!  My hubby enjoyed the bacon blue burger and I had a cream of tomato soup - yummy!  This place will definitely make the rotation of our regular drinking stops in Tempe - well done!",

Cheese plate with half as much cheese, etc. Tonight the cheese curds, usually out of this world, lacked fluff and crispiness. Some of them didn't even have cheese in them or were deflated and a bit soggy. Also got the \"pretty decent\" nachos. Yeah, they're pretty decent. Mediocre. Paid an extra three dollars for \"guacamole\" which was actually just avocado chunks on the top. Should probably have more chicken and toppings on them for the price. But yeah, pretty decent is a good way to describe them. I love pedal house but wasn't super thrilled about them tonight.",

I got the sauteed mushroom burger because I have a weird obsession with mushrooms and wow it was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had.

It did  It was happy hour just prior to a movie and then just after, so that says a lot. On my original visit I never looked back. On my last visit I made a bee-line to get back!  As reviewed the place is massive and gleaming, it's a beautifully designed place from front door to back patio and in-between.  After tasting the Hause Brews I'm hooked, Its a wonderful selection from top to bottom. Only one other brewery has it covered this well. ( I wont say who, but it's not 4pks) I especially like the Belgian Dubble, It's Marvelous it really is!!!  Service was great but not personal, she served us and left us alone. Our tender did ask about our day and that's important from a happy hour bartender.   No food was ordered but after perusing the menu I will be back. I did notice the burgers started at $13.00 ea so that set the tone, but the mussels look good, and I almost always get \"the beer munchies\"  The paper menus/ lists are still a mess, but when everything else goes great it's easy to overlook.  I think they found there stride, and $3  excellent Haus Brews at happy hour are my best reason to return!!!   *follow up visit and review as promised.",

The gave us happy hour pricing even though we were there after 6:30, $3 beers and 1/2 off wings! the wings were smoked and finished in the fryer and were the perfect combo of tender and crispy! Amazing beer selection over 20 drafts mixed between their own brews and local options. Great venue all around! Thank you much Pedal Haus!!!!",

I like the open bar and could see how fun it would be with cooler weather. It was pushing 90 when we were there yet the misters helped.  They have a great in-house beer selection along with great locals.  I tried the IPA and DIPA. Both great beers and would have a got a growler if I was going home right after. The other selections range from stouts to some adventurous styles/blends such their Hefewiezen and the sour.   The food was up scale bar food. I had the Chinese salad. It was good and I like that it was not drowned in dressing. Some others in my party had the fish and chips. They told management the fries were mush (which they were) and they comped both meals!  I thought this was great customer service since we weren't expecting this.   The service was prompt although we had to flag down our server for the check. Considering how busy they were, this wasn't a deal breaker.  Overall, I would return to try their other beers and the great customer service is a plus as well.  Great place for out of towners since right near Mill Ave.",

The service was good in the beginning but once we were seated, we ordered drinks and waited... and waited.. and waited. You would think that when the food comes, they would notice you didn't get your drinks. This problem didn't seem to be unique to us because the table next to us was grumbling about it as well.  I can deal with poor service and average food but the big problem was how dirty it was. I just can't imagine what the condition of the kitchen was if they allow their dining area to be so poorly kept.   I hope no one gets sick :(  There is too much competition out there to put up with inferior standards.",

These beers are well made, taste phenomenal, and you get to enjoy them in their outdoor beer garden or their beautifully designed restaurant. The tap selection features most of their beers, including seasonals, and some other breweries they feel like sharing. I've been back 4-5 times in total and the beers hold up pretty well.   Our waitress was super willing to letting us try beers before ordering a pint, and the service was really prompt and friendly throughout our group's stay.   Another awesome perk is that their merch is awesome. Not like a lot of other breweries who just stick their name on a shirt and ask for $25. These are sick and they have lots of options.

They were friendly, and made the reservation easy. Everything was ready when we arrived, food came out well-timed, and we have the same waitress I've had before Dash great waitstaff! We also had some small children in our party, and found but even though there is no kids menu, staff helped accommodate them. We ordered cheeseburgers with french fries, which were huge and we should've known to split between them. The hot sauce for the Buffalo chicken tenders was very sweet, and one guest in our party complained about the sweetness versus the spiciness. I split my sons hamburger with him, and it was one of the best burgers I've had! My mother had the salmon with capers and talked about it for three days. She loved it. I have also posted a small birthday party for a friend at this location, that time we sat outside. I love the vibe, I love the friendliness of the staff, and I love the location. The only thing I over looked, and that may have made me choose somewhere else, was that they do not validate for parking. They will however take two dollars off of your tab. So after having a great night, and a reasonably priced bar tab, I still had to pay $10 for parking. Still, that is downtown Tempe and not the fault of this location. Just Uber here, which you should be doing if you're going to be drinking anyway :-) or walk! I highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "I have not been a big fan of Pedal Haus since they originally opened. Even after the restructuring, it was still just an \"okay\" place to go. I have to say I am so happy we decided to try it out again before a concert at The Marquee Theater up the street.   First off - it was pouring rain, and snowing in the surrounding cities of Phoenix. The outdoor temperature was under 40 or something crazy (for Arizona.) Inside, the entire place was packed and there was a 45-minute wait. The hostess offered us a table under a covered gazebo, which we accepted and prepared to freeze to death. This little hostess immediately pulled a huge space heater over to our table and made sure we were okay. I want to say, the wait staff and hostess were absolutely amazing. Our main waitress was Caitlyn and she seemed to ignore the weather, the puddles, the dripping rain, and the wind and was at our table it seemed every ten or so minutes. I can not say enough about the amazing service we received. Pedal Haus has gotten their brewing system really dialed in and the beer was very good. They offer a lot of different styles of their own beer and also guest taps and guest cans. The food came out piping hot and was very good. The wings were great and the wood-fired pizza was perfect.   The location is set back west of Mill Avenue and that seemed to give them a great deal of space to spread out. Their beer garden is huge, with ping pong tables, cornhole, ladder ball, fire pits and gazebos. There is a place for live music, lots of tv's and a massive parking garage behind the facility. Happy hour is 3-6:30PM and I think beers were $5 and all appetizers were $2 off during that time.   To end the evening, as the wind kicked up and it became unbearable, the staff without us even asking pulled over two more space heaters. I have nothing but praise for Pedal Haus after what was just an amazing experience. We will definitely be coming back here.",

The amber was the best beer in the flight and we prefer IPAs.  Sadly the mojito was better than the beer.",

    "text": "I've been here twice and I can't think of anything negative.  The first time was with 3 coworkers and one of the guys and I shared our lunch so we could try a couple of things.  We went halvsies on the BMLT and the green chile burger.  Both were very nicely done.  They actually cooked the burger medium rare and it was a great burger with lots of flavor with fresh ingredients.  As good as the burger was, the BMLT outshone it for sure.  I love the twist on a BLT by using fresh mozzarella and pesto.  That sandwich was fantastic, and I'm really surprised I didn't get it again the 2nd time I was there.  One of my coworkers had wings and the other had a chicken sandwich.  Both of them really enjoyed their food as well.  The house made chips were a nice touch too.  On that visit Kayla took great care of us and was friendly and efficient with refills, and had no problem handling separate checks.  Their beer selection looked interesting when I was there the first time, but since it's frowned upon to drink during working hours, I returned the following Saturday with my husband so we could have some beer and enjoy the patio.    On that visit we tried a beer sampler and ate the Cubano and chicken pot pie.  I have to admit I think I gave him one teeny bite of my pot pie, but kept the rest all to myself.  They've got a great recipe and it was perfect comfort food for what turned out to be kind of a chilly afternoon outside.  He really enjoyed the Cubano, and the beers were good as well.  The standouts for us were the Dubbel and the Marzen, but we didn't taste a bad one in the bunch.  As an app we tried the pretzel and that was perfect and lasted about 10 seconds!  On that visit Alena was our server and she did a great job even though they were fairly busy.  Whoever designed the place did an excellent job.  Like I said, I have no complaints and look forward to a return visit.",

He rolled his eyes at me and went and whispered something to the bartender who helped 2 other people who had just arrived before coming to us who had been standing there.  That happened within the first 30 mins of getting there. Other than dealing with that bs, the place is nice and would be a perfect place to hang out when it cools down.

The cheese was ice cold and the lack of \"chicken gravy\" as disturbing. It's hard to suggest anything from the food menu.

Their in house brews are all very well done. I am a slight beer snob from Colorado so i was very happy to find this place. Also you absolutely have to try the mussels and fries with your beer of choice... And don't forget the straw!!",

I watched them pull from the fridge so it is the fridge not rotation.. no worries ordered a glass of ice to cool my beer I got a glass of ice water.. OK not letting this ruin my night, ordered lobster Mac cheese appetizer.  After 30 minutes I asked if the order was placed.  Bartender said yes he'd go check. 2 minutes later kitchen brings it out.  Slams it down I say thank you. No comment I say thank you again and she walks away.. Umm yeah too many places on mill, I'll take my $$ elsewhere..",

I was pleasantly surprised to see that crowd skewed a little older (30s, 40s) for Mill on a Saturday night. The outdoor picnic tables, games, many tables (no fighting or waiting to get a seat!), and fire pit are perfect for setting up and enjoying a relaxed few hours.",

( sat night 11 pm on mill ) that's okay , so we moved to the other bar which seemed pretty busy , sat at a table , while there were still a group of people drinking and hanging out .. But when every time we tried to get the server attention , she literally just ignored and walked by us couple of times ... And if wasn't even midnight yet ...We just gave up and left. Pretty disappointed on the first visit , didn't try anything at all. Not sure will we ever go back. Yet it's a very nice , spacey , indoor and outdoor brewery !",

I've had a veggie burger, bread pudding, and nachos that all left a lot to be desired. The nachos were potato chips with cold, soupy beer cheese. Don't mess with a classic. It doesn't work. The bread pudding was incredibly dry, and the veggie burger was mealy.  I wish this place had better food, because I would make it a go-to.",

Sat down and ordered lunch. \"We need your credit card before you can order.\" What??? Just in case I skip out? I can assure you I am 40+ years from being a college student....not that that should matter. I felt this was rude and assuming I was a deadbeat? If so.....that's your problem....not mine.

As I am allergic to nuts, if that were on the menu description I would have said something before ordering. That's why I had to sub balsamic dressing for the almond milk dressing. My son had the mustard chicken sandwich, look really good. He took a few bites and told me it tasted weird. Being typical mom, I told him \"you ordered it, yo u eat it\". After he ate just the chicken out of it I tasted the bun. Yup, tasted weird. Burnt in fact. Smelled burned even. Sorry son. Told the waitress and got the old \"let me talk to my manager\". They took a big ol $2 off! His sandwich was $13! All he ate was the chicken... For alright food, I probably won't be back. Sad because I work on Mill Ave just down the street.",

Went to stick a fork in the fries and all I heard was crunch and didn't get anything on my fork. Bartender took my friends ID and mine for using a copper cup. He didn't give our IDs back and we had noticed once we left and went to another bar 2 hours later. The Moscow Mule was the weakest one I've had anywhere!   Food is overpriced!!!  Go for a beer.
