The panini was also good- delicious bread. They have several different bubbly brunch drinks- I got the raspberry which wasn't necessarily cheap ($8) but very good.",

We split the Strawberry Chicken Salad and the Mediterranean Melt Sandwich.  The split if for us.  We topped it off with a piece of carrot cake.  The presentation of all of the food was so appealing.  The waitress was so accommodating with my broken ankle and happily took a picture of us together.  She gave us good entree recommendations.  We were there for quite a while and she never complained.  I gave her a good tip.  I will totally go back again and again and bring other friends and family.  It's been around for about 20 years.  Be aware that parking is limited so you might need to do valet parking for $3 plus tip.",

    "text": "My 4 star rating is with a big fat juicy caveat... Let me start with the 'bad' part.   To their GLUTEN FREE customers... BE VERY, VERY careful. We dined there with my sister today for lunch. She has ciliac and has to be very careful not to eat any gluten. Since this restaurant was highly ranked as gluten free-friendly, we decided to go.   The menu clearly labels which items are GF. BUT the menu wasn't accurate... We were told by our server that some of the dishes have changed, and the menu hasn't been updated to reflect these changes. You must be careful to ask the server all the right questions to ensure your dish is truly GF. For example, one of the dishes is GF. Our server recommended it, saying it was tasty. When we asked her in detail what it was like, she ended her description with 'and only very lightly breaded' before frying. When we inquired about the breading, she said, \"it's not real bread... It's panko\". We felt embarrassed to explain to her that panko bread crumbs are real bread. Duh.  So she ordered the salad, which had raspberries, goat cheese, and grilled chicken. Looked delicious, and the menu said it's GF. She even asked that the candied pecans be left out, since we didn't get a good feel from her that she knew if the chef used flour or not (because some do). The salad arrived, and the goat cheese had a slight ... coating ... on it that caused us to be concerned. The server assured us it's grilled goat cheese and that the coating we saw was from the grill. We asked her to please double check and it turns out they use rice crispies to coat the cheese. Rice crispies??? I know there is GF rice crispies, but we doubt they're using it. We sent the entire salad back to be re-made, in case gluten crumbs remain on the rest of the food.  Enough with the bad. Let's do the 'good' part.  The food at this restaurant is simply amazing. Full of flavor, fresh as if you cooked it yourself, I would not hesitate to eat here again, sans my GF relatives and friends. I had the tuna sandwich for lunch, along with the potato salad. It was fantastic. One of us got the crabcake, and being originally from Baltimore, we know good crabs. This crabcake rivals those we would get back home. I had no room for dessert, but I definitely will come back and order dessert next time I'm there.  There's a large outdoor patio (front and rear), so dining al fresco is pretty easy. During the heat of the summer it might be a bit uncomfortable, but the rest of the year it's fantastic.  Bottom line: if you aren't concerned about your food content (vegan, GF, or vegetarian) then I highly recommend this place. If you go because they offer GF or any specialty diet-friendly food, then I warn you to exercise caution: know exactly what you can/can't have, and ask the server. If the server seems unsure, ask to speak to the chef or someone else in the know.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place.  Farm-to-table, fresh food is a huge favorite  for me.  However, it was pretty disappointing from the first moment.    The hostess was missing and everyone else ignored us for a few minutes - no biggie, but not great.  We were eventually seated in a cute little outer building - this might have had potential, but it was freezing in the room.    The biggest issues were the service and the food.  We had a terribly unpleasant server - she was brusque, forgot to leave the ice out of our water, and had a completely unapproachable manner.  She was busy, which was ok, but she barely checked on us - between that and her attitude, the problems we had were magnified.  First, the room freezing to the point I actually mentioned it her (ordinarily, I would never do that).  She adjusted the temperature, but another patron actually went over and adjusted the thermostat back.  Our server didn't ask us if the temperature was better or notice that it was set to cold again.    The food was expensive and slightly below average.    My husband's pricey yogurt parfait wasn't impressive, and his pastry, which we had really high hopes for, was just blah.    I ordered an omelet with potatoes.  The omelet was just ok - a bit dry - but the potatoes plainly tasted like sausage and, since I don't eat meat, this was rather a large problem.  I asked the server if the potatoes could possibly have been cooked with meat.  She looked at me oddly (rudely) and told me they were absolutely not.  However, since they tasted like sausage to me and to my husband, I didn't eat them, and I didn't bother to ask for new ones.  Overall, a huge disappointment.  What a waste of such a cute atmosphere.",

    "text": "What's a French cottage doing in the middle of Scottsdale? I don't know, but I adore it. I had lunch here with my lovely gal pals, along with scores of other ladies who lunch. Everything is so dainty and cute here, it might not be a dining destination of choice for most manly men. But no doubt that the guys who have eaten here will tell you that the food is pretty amazing.  Farm-to-table food is dished up here, and there is not one thing on the menu that won't tantalize your taste buds. I had such a hard time deciding what to get, and after looking around at other tables and digging deep into my own cravings, I decided to order their Chicken, Wild Mushroom and Leek Crepes with goat cheese and basil beurre blanc. Wow, was this decadent! It's saucey, which I wasn't expecting, so it was a bit rich. But the combination of ingredients were delicious and I ate every last bite. The salads that my friends had looked fantastic as well, and portions were huge. I was also eying the Wild Mushroom, Spinach and Goat Cheese Tart and their signature strawberry chicken salad, but unfortunately, I'll have to wait for my next trip back to AZ to taste them.   Of course, we had to make room for dessert. You must not skip their desserts! Again, everything sounded wonderful, but we went with a carrot baby cake and a coconut baby cake. Don't be misled - these cakes are not bite size. We had to take at least half of each home because they were so big.   A beautiful setting for a lovely lunch, and if it's gorgeous out, try to snag one of their patio tables out back. It's places like these that make me wish I was a professional lady who lunches!",

    "text": "I work by Old Town and I have been on the hunt for a new regular lunch joint ever since the owner at my favorite place told me he doesn't hire women because \"they aren't hard workers\" (yeah, wtf - so I never went back.) A few weeks went by of horrible Chipotle and the occasional desperate drive to far away places like LGO and Pane Bianco. Finally I heard about Arcadia Farms Marketplace, looked up the menu online, and drove over immediately. They have a good assortment of breakfast items, and for lunch there is soup, salad, and sandwiches. Salads are pre-made to go, sandwiches you have to wait for them to make.  Sandwiches. I've been here three times so far (just this week, oops), and have tried three different sandwiches. The first, and my favorite was the mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich. It's served on focaccia and the ingredients are super fresh and flavorful. In my opinion they overdo it on the mozz, so I removed about half, no biggie. Yesterday I had the curry chicken salad sandwich. Served on a really hearty multi-grain bread that was tasty and satisfying. The chicken salad itself was just meh for me. Just way too many raisins. I removed at least 20 and still managed to eat more than that. Probably wouldn't order it again since I don't mind raisins but this was overkill.  Today I went for the Smoked turkey and brie. This was really good too.. Although the description said it has cranberry mayo, mine had some sort of gelatinous fruit spread instead. Whatever, it was good. The walnut bread it comes on is awesome. Yum.  I love that they have more than one vegetarian sandwich option on the menu! I will be trying the Roasted Artichoke and Ricotta sandwich next. I tried to order the Pressed Chicken sandwich without bacon today, but they informed me the bacon is already mixed in with the other ingredients. What a bummer for those of us who don't eat pork.   Drinks. I like the iced tea. They said it was mango but I couldn't really tell. I'm not much of a tea connoisseur so who knows. Today I got an Arnold Palmer thinking it would be sweeter than the tea but it really wasn't much of a difference. Also the menu shows an AP costs $3 when a reg iced tea or lemonade are only $2.50. Doesn't make much sense if you're just using half of each. But anyway she charged me $2.50 so maybe they realize the menu is wrong.  Baked goods. Extremely tempting spread! Brownies, cookies, muffins, scones, cupcakes, dessert breads, savory breads, macaroons, mini cakes, and more. All but the mini cakes are priced $2.50-$3 and are ginormous, so perfect to share. I've tried the macaroon - which was the size of a damn tennis ball! - it's like a meal in itself. I also tried a bite of my coworker's magic bar or whatever you call that thing with the coconut, chocolate, nuts, etc. It was pure sin.   Shop. They sell all kinds of kitchen items, and you could easily whip up a cute housewarming or other last minute gift. There are platters, cutting boards, ceramic items and more. Currently there is no seating inside, only on the patio, so that could prove to be an issue when we hit the hottest months. There are about 5 parking spots dedicated to the Marketplace on the east side, just ignore the valet only signs.   Service. There have been only two employees working on all my visits. One in the kitchen and one at the counter. They are quick and friendly and knowledgeable about the ingredients when I've had questions.   Overall I am really pleased and will be returning often. I will update my review when I have worked my way through some of the salads and soups!",

Even with the reservation we had to wait about 15 minutes.  Menu looked appetizing.  Sounded very up-scale!    I had the salmon.  If you can call it that.  The actual salmon was microscopic.  A tiny piece perhaps 2\" square by about 1/2\" thick.  That's it.  The rest was \"greens\".  Apparently they expect you to fill up on \"greens\".  And the flavor of that miniscule bit of salmon was just ordinary.  Nothing special.  One person had a sandwich.  It was small, but bigger than the salmon.  It was reasonably tasty.  At least as good as Quiznos.  But, again, nothing special.  Also, you have to ask for bread service.  It's complimentary, but if you don't ask you don't get.  And the bread wasn't even warm.  The lemonade was really sub-par.  Not good.  The one bright spot was that their apricot tea is really outstanding.  If you like salads and \"greens\", you might like this place.  The person we went with had been there before, and she loved her strawberry salad.  But even she commented that the portion size had shrunk (she had never finished a whole serving before, but this time she did).  The other two salad-eaters in the group weren't as impressed (they didn't get the strawberry salad, though).  Overall...I'd skip this place.  Drop in and buy the tea (they sell it in leaf form), but skip the food.  Overpriced, undersized, and nothing special on the flavor front.",

I have been coming here for lunch since I moved to Arizona from California 13 years ago and they still have my favorite salad, sandwiches and the glazed lemon cookie!!!  Arcadia Farms has the best Arnold Palmer and I always order this when I am here.  I like the ambiance, cute little place to have a nice lunch with your girlfriends and just sit down and enjoy the outdoor sitting (except for the occasional birds that come flying close by)!  But heck, the birds are part of what this place is all about, just make sure not to feed them anything please!  Service is pretty good and the servers do pay attention to you, even when you're sitting solo (my friend was late and so I was sitting by myself waiting).  There was the issue of breakfast and lunch but our server was very helpful and gracious about it.  I think what I love about this place is that it reminds me of where women gather to meet their friends and just sit down and have a good chatty time...",

    "text": "Absolutely one of the very best restaurants in the Valley of the Sun.  The only bad thing I can say is that I wish they were open for dinner!  We rearranged our schedules just to be able to dine here...and were absolutely thrilled!  Make a reservation if you can (even if only a few minutes out) to be assured of a table!  Service is top shelf and speedy too!  The menu offers lots of choices and I ordered the crepes. Soooo good, I almost found myself licking the plate!  My husband ordered the club sandwich and it was 5-star as well.  Make sure to save room for the Baby Cakes!  We split a coconut baby cake....and seriously...I could have eaten one all by myself it was so good.  The White Sangria is a delicious addition to any meal.  Definitely going to make this a re-visit next month when the girls descend on Scottsdale!",

The food is very pleasant and is a tasty artisanal version of a combination of country and home cooking. Everything that we had from salads to sandwiches and the desserts were delicious.",

The AF breakfast sandwich is filling and tasty - homemade crispy English muffin, lots of egg and cheese with a little bit of tangy mayo, husband and I prefer it with ham over the bacon. Every pastry I've ever had is excellent as well (lemon cake cookie was SO moist, strawberry scone perfectly lightly sweet, chocolate chip cookies have just the right amount of crisp around the edges but are mostly gooey and chocolatey...) and the service is always friendly. And of course it's so charming, seating indoors and out, and they have their own parking lot so it's easy to pop in and grab something. I've also had the turkey Brie and Apple sandwich which is served on awesome walnut bread with a touch of fig jam - yum. You can tell everything is made in house and with so much love and attention. I plan on bringing all of our out of town visitors here. The only bummer is that they are closed on Sundays.",

The atmosphere was excellent, all these little rooms and an outdoor patio in back and seating on the street as well.  I had the warm chicken salad, very fresh & tasty.  Hubby had a bowl of soup, butternut squash, that was very good.  Then he had the grilled salmon which was good, not great.  For being so busy, the service was still very good.  What brings this down for me to 3.5 instead of 4 stars is the price.  Very expensive for what you get.  My salad was $15 and the other entree was $16 or $17 and the piece of salmon was very small.",

The crepes were the best entree we had, the hummus was dry, the sandwiches were also very dry (like when you scrape the top of your mouth). The worst though, was the service. I understand they get very busy there, but I saw plenty of servers. Our waitress was extremely pushy saying she wasn't leaving the table until we ordered, which she did, so while we sat there trying to figure out what we were ordering she stood over us. Once we got our bill we never saw her again, we sat with empty water's, tea and lemonade the rest of the time even when she picked up our card. Overall, I won't be spending my money at this established ever again.",

Right off the bat I felt unwelcome--I was excited to get a spot right in front for convenience for getting my toddler out of the car--but was promptly told that it wasn't a parking spot and that it was only for customers getting take-out. If this is the case then put up some signs. I had a terrible experience here a few weeks ago but decided to give it another try. Julia is wonderful although she is clearly spread thin and has to be the employee constantly making up for the mistakes of the kitchen and her coworkers. The way this place is run is laughable. It does not give the indication that the customer comes first--rather that the owners are money-hungry snobs. It's time to work out the kinks and get it together!! Your kitchen is disastrously slow and your staff clearly has trouble with consistency and communication. You need to get someone in there to actually \"manage\" this place. This is so obviously not a finely oiled machine. So sad :( NEVER. GOING. BACK.",

    "text": "My friend, my toddler and I enjoyed lunch here today on their beautiful patio. Our mouths watered the entire drive there as we talked about the menu (we had looked it up on-line) and discussed what we would order. We were immediately seated even though we didn't have a reservation on a Friday at noon and they have high chairs which I always appreciate (and I'm sure most of you, rightfully, could care less about).   It didn't take us long before we decided on some white sangria, the crab and avocado tower, savory smoked salmon cheesecake and the wild mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart. The waitress told us that if we wanted everything to come out at once it would be faster. OK. Doesn't make sense to us, but whatever you say. Meanwhile we enjoyed our sangria which was garnished with beautiful fresh fruit but tasted pretty heavy on the OJ. While I've never met a white sangria I didn't like, I have to say the Chelsea's Kitchen's white sangria is much better. Of course everything at Chelsea's Kitchen is so heavenly, God must be working in the kitchen and if that's the case, he mixes a mean drink (and my God mixes cocktails), but I digress.   The three plates arrived together and we started on the goat cheese and mushroom tart first since it was warm. It was so delicious I wanted to hold it in my mouth a little longer than one might consider \"normal\" just so it's beautiful cheesey, silky, earthy, mushroomness wouldn't have to vacate my taste buds so soon. Leeks, mushrooms and goat cheese - now that's a menage a trois! Maybe I was a little clairvoyant when I saved the last few bites of it to eat at the end of the meal to have that flavor left in my mouth last.   Next we had the crab and avocado tower. My toddler has a thing for seafood so he had the first bite and we probably should have paid more attention when he didn't finish what I gave him. It had such a beautiful presentation, not much thought was given to seasoning the crab mixture. Now don't get me wrong, the crab was incredibly fresh, it was just bland. It needed a splash of citrus to brighten it. It also came with a small bowl of bland gazpacho that we fixed with salt and pepper but we weren't sure what to do with it. The dish didn't come with a spoon so surely it wasn't meant to be eaten that way. Was the crab meant to be dipped into it? That didn't work well because you couldn't get the chunks of veggies (and I like my veggies). We gave up and dumped in onto the plate and swilled our crab into it. The acid in the tomatoes helped perk up the bland crab a little bit.   We saved what we thought was the best for last. The smoked salmon cheesecake. It looked so beautiful on the plate. Almost like a little cake frosted in mascarpone and garnished with capers. We cut into in and spread it on the toasted french bread and shoved it into our salivating mouths (and the salivating, demanding toddler). We both stopped chewing and just stared at each other. It was so bland, If it wasn't pink inside and I didn't know it was a smoked salmon cheesecake, I probably never would have guessed. And the worst part yet, the inside was dry and crumbly. I don't know about you but when I think of cheesecake, creaminess is at the forefront. We picked at it then my toddler ate the rest of it straight up with his fingers. Not only does he have a taste for seafood but he has a gourmet cheese fetish. The stinkier and more expensive, he thinks the better. What do they say about champagne wishes and caviar dreams?   We were going to have dessert but decided against it. We figured we would cut our losses and move on. I understand why it's so popular with the senior set if what they say is True about older people liking blander food. Maybe Sunday brunch is better, maybe we ordered the wrong things on the menu. If you're interested only in the ambiance though, this place is for you.",

This cutie-little-space celebrates being a woman.   With all due respect, I would never want to have a date take me to Arcadia Farms, nor would I suggest it, because this is where I come with my girlfriends to talk about our most recent 'dates.' Or, this is the place where you take your new date's mom, or for a baby shower, bridal shower, or a woman's 21st, 30th, or 37th birthday (that's a hint that I have a birthday soon...)!   Even the service and ambiance is perfectly female - oh, and before I forget the baked goods that greet you as you walk in the front door seem to fit my waistline better than the date I would never bring there anyway...

Oh my goodness my mouth still waters just thinking about them! The mushroomy sauce in them is sooooo tasty.  My husband ordered a sandwich and said it was great.  For dessert we had their creme brulee, which came with a berry compote and nuts on top, very very good.  My husband had the carrot cake and was extremely annoyed when I asked for a bite cause he wanted every last crumb to himself.  They serve wine and beer, I ordered their cheapest glass of Pinot Noir off the menu and I wish I would have written down the name cause it was perfect, it was slightly sweet but not too sweet. mmmmm  All the way around a lovely Saturday afternoon dining experience.",

Since I was early I decided to check out the marketplace first. They do have food to go as well as really good looking pastries and an assortment of beverages to go. I did notice a bottle of Rosewater Lemonade which I love and is rare to find. I walked over to the cafe and it was pretty busy. I had made a reservation and was seated promptly. The menu has a lot of options. I was torn between the turkey, apple and brie sandwich on walnut bread with fig jam and the chopped salad. I went for the salad since I am trying to eat more veggies. The salad was fresh with a lot of bacon, chicken, avocado and a blue cheese vinaigrette. I had a nice peach iced tea as well and it was full of flavor.

I love that the servings aren't humongous - I cleaned my plate! I hate the mushroom omelet and it was delicious! My 3-year-old daughter stole several bites. We can't wait to come back when the weather is cooler and sit outside! We had a reservation, which I don't think was necessary on a weekday morning, but it was nice that they do that.",

    "text": "The food is good, but service struggles during breakfast at this pretty little place in Scottsdale. I've been a few times in the last month with work colleagues. Plenty of parking on the street out front during weekday morning. The place has always been mostly empty one my visits but the one server seemed really frazzled. I was finished with my first cup of coffee before my friends decaf arrived. And my colleagues were half done with their omelette and and tarts by the time my bowl of muesli was delivered. We had to flag (literally waving arms) done the waitress to refill our water and coffee.  Though service is scattered, the food is really good. The complimentary strawberry scones dusted with powdered sugar are tasty and the muesli is some of the best I've had ever- creamy, loaded with cinnamon, diced fruit, golden raisins, nuts. I wouldn't be my first choice given all the service issues, but if the meeting is scheduled for this place at least the breakfast is tasty.",

    "text": "This place was good and a very pleasant little adventure in Scottsdale. Five Stars as I would love to go back and my wife really liked it too.  Location: In or near old Scottsdale which is being revitalized with renewal and new building going on everywhere. Sort of on a side street. You will not drive by it unless looking for it.  Venue: There are really two parts to this place. The well-established restaurant which is to the left, and the newer, sort of annexed shop on the right, called the marketplace. Being our first time here, we didn't notice the restaurant part but spotted the Marketplace side which also served food. Nicely decorated farm house sort of theme.  So this review is mostly for the Marketplace side of the business. We would have gone to the restaurant side for breakfast if we knew.  The marketplace has a few parking spots right in front, a couple of outdoor tables, and a larger indoor portion with a bakery, drink station and food prep area for the menu items. It also has gift or souvenir items which my wife enjoyed looking at.  Food: Wife ordered a smoked salmon, cream cheese on english muffin or ciabatta bread and loved it. She had hot tea and they happened to have some flavored green tea which she enjoyed. We found it amusing that the waitress was surprised that anyone would ever ask for green tea, plain. LoL   I joked that we should really mess with her and ask for rice...we are in Arizona and not at home in Hawaii. I had a sort of scalloped potatoes dish which was vegetarian and very good. I forgot the name of the dish.  I also had some black coffee that was dark and rich. $2.50 for a 16 oz cup!!! Yeah we are not in Hawaii!  Also of note, each of our dishes was less than $8.   Service: Everyone was pleasant and helpful. Each seemed to have their specific role and no crossover was allowed. The main Waitress was doing a 5 Star job and it was only her second day on the job. She was doing everything. So I watched as I thought this was interesting. An owner, a second owner, and a daughter and a granddaughter were letting her do all the work! Then we ordered food and the granddaughter and cook sprang into action. The daughter delivered the food. The waitress went to get our drinks and of course the machine was out of coffee, so she had to remake it herself even though things were getting busy...interesting arrangement but it seemed to work for them. I hope the new waitress will be appreciated as she seemed to be handling everything on her own. I left her a good tip. The owners were not the ogres that I imagined them to be at first. All seemed good. I just thought it was interesting to observe the work arrangement.  We both liked it and my wife bought a few extra items that appealed to her for herself. Im going with 5 stars and really recommend this place.",

When we arrived, we asked if we had a reservation, we said no, and the hostess kind of made us feel guilty we didn't make a reservation. She sat us down outside on the patio as we requested.   The server was very nice. I believe her name was rasheeda. We ordered the goat cheese dip to start, and my, it was phenomenal! It was so tasty. And for entree, I ordered the salmon salad, which had a great light mustard dressing. It was wonderful. The ambiance is great and the food was fantastic. 5 stars!

We arrived in time, the last hour of breakfast.    What I did not know was how popular the destination was for breakfast and lunch which had reserved most outdoor tables, fear not, we were sat within a minute of arrival. (Can we get this on openTable?)  I ordered the breakfast quesadilla, and she the two eggs and bacon (so basic, no curiosity I say!), a plain croissant (we were too tardy for the pain au chocolate).  I would then ask for the jam and it would be delivered, it went elegantly with the croissant.  Just as I finished the buttered masterpiece we were given two small strawberry scones that needed to multiply in palette, so delicious, but our food arrived hot.  The quesadilla had complex flavor...but, I do have a question, was the guacamole house made, because it did not appear that way.  Irregard to that fact it was awesome.  My coffee was always full, probably a bit too much, but I'll take a full hot coffee from none at all.  Cheers to the waitress!",

After awhile it did get kind of hot and wish we would've ate inside but we still had a nice time.  Our waitress was nice and kept our drinks filled. My friend loved the peach ice tea and I had coffee and it was probably one of the best cup of joes I've had in awhile. I ordered the breakfast quesadilla and it was delicious! Fluffy eyes with sausage, zucchini, peppers, corn, cheese and served with fresh guacamole and salsa. My friend enjoyed her mushroom omelet with potatoes and a side a bacon.

In the upper right hand corner of their menu they have the farms that they get their produce. I would say that the greater part of their menu is focused on eggs and the healthier side of breakfast versus the sweet. They do have pastries, French toast, crepes, etc, but that's not the main focus of their menu. Also, their prices are fairly reasonable. I could be a little bias because I am from San Diego and I have become accustom to very expensive meals.",

Our food was delivered about 12:15pm. The french toast and the crepes were both quite good (hence the 2-star review) but the breakfast potatoes seemed straight from the can with a red coating and the bread pudding was soggy. No mention of baby cakes or dessert or coffee/tea or the original drink order placed. Service was so sluggish and unfriendly my guests could not believe I had suggested this place.

The reality is that parking is awful, birds whiz by your face and scamper across the awning constantly. Food was sub par, lacking in effort and overpriced. Cheese plate was lifeless, raspberry salad was uninspired and the turkey and brie sandwich we inquired about was \"pre assembled\" so we couldn't substitute for a different bread. The service was good and place seemed clean, think perhaps it's just not my cup of tea. I strive to find food made with love and lots of attention to detail. This seemed more pre made/churned out/ bland, etc. I know back in the 1990s this was the place to go, maybe a little reboot is necessary. Too many other options in South Scottsdale these days. Cute to look at from the outside. Enjoy your luncheons, ladies.",

I love to come here not only for the chocolate croissants but because they actually have breakfast meals that don't include eggs. I don't like eggs and it's actually really hard to find something substantial on a menu without them. I always get he wild mushroom tart and it is soooo good! And filling. It is served with a side of fruit and also strawberry scones. You will absolutely be full after all of that, but a little pastry to start off with never hurt anyone. The coffee they serve here is also really good. I'm not sure what kind it is but its yummy.   Good place to bring out of town guests. Everyone loves it. My friend brought her mom the first day of the vacation and she insisted on going back every day after for the duration of the trip!   Both outside and inside tables are a nice place to be.",

My whole experience was so bad it could have been a sitcom TV show.  We sit at a what could have been quaint table on the patio. The linen was crisp and clean. The glassware was spotless. The patio was cockeyed and the floor slanted and we just had to sit at an angle.I don't know if other patio tables here are like this but the two top one closest to the hostess stand is the one I'm talking about. It's the little table where you watch the people coming in.  I didn't think lunch would be terribly long so I thought it didn't matter but gosh if I was old I'd need a chiropractor for my hurt back. This was the most uncomfortable table I ever sat at in my whole life.  The iced tea I ordered tasted like bubble gum. ????????????  OK so now my back hurts and the iced tea is terrible but I'm still thinking things will be OK.  We wait and wait for our salads.  I decided to use the ladies room and gosh it was cold in there and if I had nuts they'd fall right off. HONEST it was like walking into a freezer. I guess women who are going threw hot flashes would love it.  We wait and wait and our waiter apologies to us and gives us refrigerator cold bread and ice hard cold but pretty swirled butter while we wait.  We finally get our salads AND THEY LOOK REALLY GOOD! But my chicken was dry ,it was so dry I think my throat could have gotten splinters and it's not just me being picky. My husband started eating my chicken and screamed about how dry it was. I think they cooked it for 45 minutes and that's what took so long. The salad looked beautiful but I couldn't eat it. A nice girl that worked there asked me about it and I told her the chicken was dry but I couldn't eat the salad because they didn't make the dressing right. I can't say for sure but I think the dressing was just oil with nothing else and it was horrible and not edible. This salad upset my stomach.  I did also speak to the manager who seemed concerned. The manager offered me dessert but I declined and he took $10. off the bill.  My husband said his shrimp were overdone and he wasn't sure if he had any dressing on his salad and thought he only had a little of the pesto from the shrimp on it.   I did notice several large parties were in while I was there and that must have been contributing factor of the problem with the preparation of my meal.  I'm sure they are not like this most of the time and it was just me being here at the WRONG TIME.  Weird tasting iced tea. uncomfortable table. Ice cold restroom. DRY not good Chicken. Beautiful salad maybe just oil as dressing.  Not for me.",

The case is full of some scrumptious looking baked goods, which I will definitely need to save room for next time!  We didn't buy anything this time, since we had just eaten, but what a convenient little place to pick up a quick yummy meal...and even better, most items are a few $$ less than on the menu across the street!",

Everything about the decor is charming, as in Emily Post style charming not at all cute-sie. The staff is awesome-warm & friendly but not intrusive. But what would an amazing environment be without equally amazing food? The food at Arcadia Farms is just as wonderful as the aura. First, all the food is fresh, locally grown food & it tastes that way. If you are there for breakfast, I highly recommend the Breakfast Panini. I am a huge breakfast person & breakfast doesn't get much better than the Breakfast Panini. For lunch, I like the Mediterranean Melt. The roasted veggies in the Mediterranean Melt really highlight the freshness & flavor of the ingredients being used.   To sum it up-Arcadia Farms is faboo. (At least in my book.)",

Since we had a movie to catch we decided to skip the apps and got straight to business.  One of the ladies got the chicken and veggie quesadilla which was HUGE.  The other two got salads which they beamed about and I got the savory crepes that had roasted chicken, creamed leeks, and mushrooms.

I certainly didn't feel as though I were still in Phoenix, for it had a southern Californiaesque vibe to it.   Putting the California vibe aside, as my friend and I sat took our seats, I noticed that the place had a beautiful back patio, but it was the lunch crowd, so we were unable to snag a place in the great outdoors. Simple decor, neutrals, browns, wine bottles, greenery, and fresh air added to the ambience.   We ordered from our server right away which was great, despite the  crowd. When she came back with our ice tea, little did I know that I would taste the best ice tea I've ever had. I was so intrigued by the flavour, that I actually bought a package before I left.  Thus, came the food. It took a while, but good conversation made up for the wait. I ordered the Mediterranean Melt. Awesome. Roasted eggplant, red pepper, sauteed onions, portobello mushroom, smoked mozzeralla, pesto spread all combined between crunchy ciabatta bread. I think with my first bite, I had a heart attack (because I loved it so ), and was revived again when I drank my apricot ice tea (because I loved it so).  I cannot  forget the salad that came with the sandwich. A simple field green salad that complimented my sandwich quite well. Overall, it was a big portion of a lunch that I normally don't indulge in. The sandwich was $12 and the ice tea was ??--but I would've paid $10 for a glass of their ice tea. It was a great lunch..Thank you Arcadia Farms  Gen",

    "text": "This place is very Cute. I was able to have a delightful brunch here. Based on the reviews I somewhat expected more. The food is a solid 2.5 -3, but the place is cute and homey and I guess that is what makes it so quaint.  My friend told me there are plenty of baby showers and bridal showers and I can see why. It's like being in a small cottage- eating with friends.  The waitress that day was not so attentive and we had to flag her down a couple of times.  My warm chicken salad was Blah.. but my friend's  Crepe , from what I remembered was Very Tastey.. The desserts were cute, but nothing extraordinary.. overall the place is for the ambiance and for company with friends, on a  brunch out ting.. but if you are to do a real brunch I say head to the Hotel Brunches for all you can eat.. a little more on the price, but alot more appetizing.. especially if you are on vacation!",

Or go their afterwards and try one of the fine desserts too.",

The setting was lovely and the  slight breeze made sitting outside a very pleasant experience. Our waitress, we all agreed, was friendly, attentive, and went the extra mile to make our dining experience a very enjoyable one. The food is well prepared, fresh, and very delicious. Two of us ordered the spinach, mushroom and goat cheese tart--it was better than good. We would have it again. The breakfast quesadilla was also very good. Fresh fruit is served with must of the breakfast entrees.The lemon cake was light and had the right amount of lemon in it, plus it wasn't too sweet. There is a market across the street where you can purchase the baked goods. We would all come back here again for the food, atmosphere, and good service. We found the prices fair and not overpriced at all.",

Unfortunately, my last two visits were not so hot. Food was ok and the service sucked. Excuse my language, but I was severely disappointed. I took a group including my mother, father, and grandmother for a special brunch, a celebration. The service was just horrendous. Lots of waiting, incorrect orders, items not brought when requested. Our bill was hefty, nothing taken off for the problems we had. I received no response from management through Opentable, where I made the reservations. Sorry to say, this is no longer one of my \"places\" to go.",

It also seemed to disrupt the service a bit for the changeover. Once back in the flow the service was decent.   Turkey and Brie sandwich seemed like it should've been hotter. A hot sandwich and grilled, but was served barely like warm.   One very annoying thing is a pet peace of mine: they turned on a vacuum cleaner and were cleaning the floors during our meal. It was the next room, but in plain sight and we were right through the open door. It's a small place to begin with and the atmosphere was ruined, even if just briefly.",

Do NOT leave without trying (or taking with you) their famous lemon cookie. It takes cookies to a whole new level. Janice even warmed it for us.

This is the cutest little cottage type atmosphere and the courtyard is just to die for. I came here for brunch a few weeks ago and could not get over the atmosphere. Parking is a bit hectic, but no worries the weather was nice enough to walk down the street. We were quickly seated in the shaded courtyard outside, and promptly ordered our mimosas ( as one should for brunch!) then I ordered a quiche. The quiche was delicious and had leeks and goat cheese. Service was so fast I couldn't believe it, and after looking around I noticed so many girls were there celebrating engagements and babies! This is clearly a great place to meet up!   After the check came, we popped in next door to the bakery and it was absolutely adorable. I will definitely be back to try one of their gigantic coconut cupcakes!",

No hostess appeared for five minutes before taking down names from the customers. When it was our turn, she told us it would be another 5  minutes. There was no friendly greeting or welcoming attitude. We sat down at an empty outside table and chatted for a while.  About 12 minutes later after everyone else was seated my friend went to find the hostess (for the second time) and asked about our table.  We had specifically asked to be seated outside and to make sure it was not in the sun.  The hostess led us to a table on the patio with no umbrella for shade.  There were many open tables by this time so I really didn't understand why she was trying to seat us there.  When we restated that we did not want to sit in the sun, and her response was less than welcoming. We decided to leave and go somewhere else. Now I know this is a charming place, with pretty good food in a lovely setting.  I just kept getting the feeling that since they are such a successful restaurant they don't really put much effort into their customer service.  It's as if they are saying, \" We have more business than we need so if you don't like it here that's your problem.\"",

Arcadia Cafe is a cute, gardenesque venue that allows me to enjoy a lovely brunch and feel somewhat fancy without spending a lot of money.  Both the fresh berry crepes and crepes croque-monsieur are delicious in their own way. The berry crepes are almost like having dessert for breakfast! And the conque-monsieur is savoury with ham, cheese bechamel sauce but light with the use of crepes instead of bread.  You can even sip on tea or coffee and indulge on treats from their bakeshop if you're not looking for a full meal. The atmosphere is something you'll want to experience.",

Once seated, it took a while for our water and even longer to attempt to order. Sadly, what was available was slim pickings. No croissants, multi grain bread, rye bread or my companion's first choice of beer, it was a guessing game. The server gave no guidance or could he recommend anything so, rather than aggravating myself further I settled for a cup of coffee intending to get something else at our next stop. Waiting an unusually long amount of time for my companion's meals to arrive, my coffee and water never got refilled. The restaurant was pretty empty so it wasn't loud and I heard a nearby table receive the beer our waiter said they were out of.  After waiting too long for some kitchen leftovers, we left.   On a good note, it was lovely in the garden. There were several umbrellas to guard against the lethal desert sun but none were employed.",

    "text": "If renowned Old Town Scottsdale restaurant Cafe Monarch had a little breakfast and lunch sibling, Arcadia Farms would fit the mold.  Or at least the Cafe portion of this operation would.  That said, Arcadia Farms is more of a complex than anything else.  First an foremost, Arcadia Farms is a restaurant and cafe.  Next door, the Marketplace sells assorted baked goods, cookbooks, and knick knacks.  And surrounding the cafe and marketplace are various private dining rooms that are used frequently for big groups (my sister actually used one of them for a baby shower not too long ago).  As for me, I just wanted a good breakfast on a Sunday morning and I'd never tried Arcadia Farms.  At the opening bell, I was their first Sunday customer that morning.  I should cop to the fact that as soon as I arrived, I immediately felt underdressed.  Based on the Google street images of the Cafe front patio I fully expected my usual shorts, t-shirt, and sandals combo to be adequate attire.  While the Cafe staff didn't implicitly or explicitly judge me on it, the customers that poured in later that morning were all in their Sunday best.  Thus my unshaven, baseball cap wearing self stuck out like a sore thumb.  Nevertheless, I grabbed a seat near the front and pressed on.  The Cafe has a small amount of seating inside, but the emphasis here is definitely the patios that line the front, side, and back of the restaurant.  I'd guess at least 2/3rds of the seating here is outside, which is great as long as the weather is cool as it was this morning.  And as others have pointed out, the interior restaurant is akin to a sitting in a contemporary living room, which is really where the Cafe Monarch comparison comes in from my experience.  Its more laid back than Cafe Monarch, but it still evokes a cozy, romantic feel similar to Monarch.  I started with a standard glass of OJ before taking a gander at the menu.  I'd peeked into the Marketplace before walking into the Cafe for breakfast so I knew I wanted to grab something from the bakery to start with.  I asked for their Homemade Cinnamon and & Pecan Rugalach out of pure curiosity, but unfortunately the bakery didn't have any available.  So instead the waitress grabbed me a pair of Strawberry N'Cream Scone bites and made them complimentary.  They were still warm and soft upon arriving at my table.  A nice fruity, savory snack to start things off (and that was nice of them to make it free).  Next up, I'd read the hype about their housemade granola parfait so I ordered one of those.  It's served in a tall wine glass and includes assorted berries (mine had raspberries, strawberries, and I think rhubarb?), vanilla yogurt, and granola mixed with dried apricots.  It lived up to the hype.  Smooth, creamy dish with a great mix of tartness contrasted by the mellow crunch of the granola.  Most would be perfectly happy with this as their breakfast for the day.  But I wanted to try one more item.  On their \"Arcadia Classics\" menu section, the Egg Strata Cobbler read like a mashup of things I loved but never thought to put together.  Oven roasted veggies, cheddar cheese, sausage and creme fraiche (insert your own South Park joke here).  I had expected this to come on a plate, but instead its stacked high in a bowl with copious amounts of that creme fraiche.  Its comfort food to be sure, but probably one of the classier comfort food dishes I've had.  And fortunately it was also ridiculously delicious.  They didn't skimp on the cheese and there were plenty of nice chunks of sausage mixed in with the veggies.  Total cost for the food, OJ, tax and tip came to about $28.  The atmosphere felt alot like Cafe Monarch to me, but fortunately the prices did not.  My waitress was a super sweet lady (didn't catch her name) and the entire meal was phenomenal.  The crowds were definitely swelling as the morning went on, so my advice would be to get here at or near opening as I did.  Parking is also a little bit tricky if you can't grab one of the street spots.  I'd park at Panera Bread a few blocks east of here and walk over if you can't get a street spot.  Founder Carolyn Ellis can beam with pride over Arcadia Farms which she created in 1990 as just a simple take out bakery.  Today its a robust destination for breakfast, lunch, baked goods, and elaborate receptions.  And really any place that evokes memories of Cafe Monarch for me is a winner in my book.",

The space was a lot larger than I had originally anticipated, they have a huge shaded courtyard in the back (great for AZ weather) and they have a few different rooms that make up the inside seating area and are each decorated differently. We sat in their backyard courtyard and ordered their house red sangria, crab cakes, and chicken wild mushroom leek crepe. The sangria was tasty (perfect for a mid afternoon drink) and it had sliced oranges and strawberries in it. The crab cakes were delicious- they were fairly substantial and you could see all of the crab meat that went into them. They also came with an ample salad which complimented them nicely. The chicken, wild mushroom leek crepes were also very tasty and actually went with the salad from the crab cakes very nicely. We unfortunately didn't get a chance to try any of their desserts because we were too full from lunch but their carrot cake from the marketplace looked delicious!",

There were some big pros and cons:   Pros:  Strawberry salad - the salad was very tasty, the strawberries were large, it had big pieces of chicken that were fairly juicy. I would order this again.   The quesadilla - very tasty quesadilla with fresh veg, salsa, and guac. I liked how they browned the tortilla significantly and that it resulted in a nice crunch when you bite into it.   Cons:  The roasted chicken sandwich... this was dry, bland, and just not good... and it sounded so good! Do not order.   The service: Very slow, inattentive  The seating- when I entered the restaurant, the front room was fairly empty, yet they seated us in their back room. This room, though most likely intended for overflow seating, was packed with people (possibly the less fancy people, lest we infringe on the 'ladies who lunch'). This space was extremely loud, the materials it is made out of echo every sound, you can hardly hear yourself think. The door also needs to be pulled closed, and when it wasn't (which happened several times) it got extremely hot.   The prices - this place is overpriced for the food you receive... it's a sandwich guys...much of the food isn't even cooked.   Anyway, this would not be one of my go to places, but if invited here by family or friends, I would come back.",

    "text": "I had a lovely Sunday lunch at Arcadia Farms Cafe with my husband and two friends, during a weekend visit to Phoenix. It was a charming little restaurant, with the feel of a rich old white lady's house--greenery and white picket fences outside, white furniture, white tablecloths, and gingham prints inside. The vibe was calm and relaxing in an upscale kind of way--like this would be a great place for a fancy tea party. I had a glass of red sangria with my lunch, and that felt right, too.  The food was excellent--fresh, clean, farm-to-table kind of fare. We ordered some warm brie with caramelized apples to share, and this was a wonderful appetizer, the cheese baked soft and gooey, the apples the perfect sweetness, all served with crusty toasted baguette. I got the roasted salmon \"super\" salad for my lunch, and it was perfectly executed. The salmon was ideally moist and flaky, and it came over a bed of farro, kale, radicchio, red onion, chickpeas, and cherry tomato, with a tarragon dressing. I loved all the textures, and every element was inherently flavorful. I very rarely order salads for meals, but this was one I'd get again and again. My husband got a modified ham and cheese sandwich (the kitchen graciously made it more kid-friendly for my 32-year-old boy) with the potato salad on the side, which I ate with enthusiasm. It was a phenomenally good potato salad, with firm, fingerling potatoes in a flavorful dill dressing.  Arcadia Farms is across the street from the Poisoned Pen bookstore, which is my destination whenever I come to Phoenix. I'm happy to have a go-to place for lunch in the area, and look forward to my next Arcadia Farms meal.",

    "text": "So disappointed today with Arcadia Farms Cafe. Met my friend today for brunch, I have been there many times for brunch. The service was, well actually, I don't really have a word for the service. Let me explain----after being seated at 10:30 we waited 10 minutes just for water. Another 10 minutes went by and I flagged down the host and asked if our server was around. She spoke to our server in passing, who rolled her eyes, pasted on a smile and took our order. Meanwhile, a couple with a young baby had sat down just adjacent to us, with the same server, and about 15 minutes later a 6 top of ladies sat on the other side of us. We did receive our food within a reasonable amount of time, thankfully. After 30 minutes the ladies still didn't have water, they went to the host and at that point decided to leave. I should state that the first server apparently was delegated to a different area, because we finished with a different server. The most disturbing part.....we left almost 2 hours later and the couple with the baby (remember them) HAD JUST RECEIVED THEIR FOOD!!!!!! Unacceptable service today!!!!!",

    "text": "After beer and ballpark food at Spring Training it was nice to enjoy an elegant brunch here at Arcadia Farms. It definitely feels like a little french cottage and the highly coveted patio seating is perfect for a ladies who lunch type event. I enjoyed the strawberry salad and the scones were delicious. Service was a bit on the slow side, but that may just be the vibe of the place.   As an SF food snob, I really enjoy a place that cares so much about the quality of their produce and being able to enjoy local and organic ingredients in my meal (I know, you're rolling your eyes, I've accepted it).  Bonus points for giving a discount if you show your Giants game ticket! :)  Given the lovely patio and experience, I will take off no stars for the fact that a very rude bird pooped on my husband.",

They always offer great recommendations if you're stuck between two choices!  I am absolutely in love with their baby cakes. I personally get the mini coconut baby cake and it is the most delicious cake I've ever had. It's just the right size for 2 if you just want a little something sweet to share, or great to take a few bites and save the rest for later! It's covered in coconut and topped with a sweet strawberry! It's delightful! I take all of my friends here to have great food and wonderful conversation in an lovely atmosphere.",

There were many empty tables that would have accommodated us but they chose to seat others.  We were eventually walked through the patio to a back low-ceiling, paneled, enclosed shed-type building with no air circulation and zero charm.  On our way out, we saw the 4-top tables had been seated with customers.  I wonder why we couldn't have been seated in the main restaurant? Very unhappy with the experience.  The food didn't justify tolerating that kind of treatment.",

    "text": "Ordered the breakfast quesadilla and loved it. Lots of veggies and eggs cooked with right firmness and flavor. Salsa was perfectly spicy for breakfast (not too hot or mild). Chocolate croissant was a bit doughy. .  On my second visit, ordered the breakfast quesadilla and blueberry crepes and shared with a friend. The quesadilla was even better than i had remembered. The tortilla is more like flaky pastry and so tasty. Blueberry crepes simply melt in my mouth. Yum!!! Servise was great from the hostess to the waitress. The courtyard was cozy and comfortable, and definitely adds to the pleasant experience. Overall a great Saturday brunch spot for me.  I have a feeling that this cafe will be receiving a 5 star review on my next visit (For me, 5-star reviews are reserved only for sustained excellent experience and for the best of its kind.)",

I was recently in Scottsdale celebrating my sister's bachelorette and, after seeing great Yelp reviews, we decided to stop by Arcadia Farms Cafe for a quick brunch before hiking. The cafe is adorably decorated and the service is great. We ordered various things, including: the coffeecake, the almond croissant, the chocolate croissant, the strawberry n'cream scone, the Muesli, the granola parfait, eggs, and bacon. A lot of food? Yes, we were hungry girls carbo loading for hiking! The food was amazing! because we enjoyed the food/experience so much, we ended up stopping by Arcadia Farms Cafe again on our last day for another brunch! This time, in addition to eating at the Cafe, we also stopped by the Marketplace for items to go - we bought: granola, cookies, and pastries! I wish there were an Arcadia Farms Cafe near me! If you're in Scottsdale, definitely try it out!",

I wasn't even asked even though I was sitting alone and many couples came in after me. Waitresses will walk away while people are still talking to them. Other than the horrible service, I can't speak on the food because I haven't been able to order. The place is very cute though. I ended up leaving after 35 minutes of no one addressing me right on the front. :(",

While it definitely has the feel of a \"ladies who lunch\" place, I was impressed that they made sure to give us timely service so that we could get back to the office within a reasonable time.  I had a chicken cobb salad while my colleagues tried other items on the menu. Everyone was very pleased with their selections and my fresh-squeezed lemonade was great as well Our server was excellent and even took the time to ask where we worked.  The only drawback I saw was that if you're going to have valet parking in Scottsdale, shouldn't it be complimentary? Almost everywhere else does it that way, so I wasn't sure why it cost $3 here.  Other than that though, this is definitely a place to go for a nice meal.",

    "text": "To be quite honest, I think one star is one star too many for mine and my family's experience today at Arcadia Farms Cafe. We arrived at 12:30 pm, and there was a line of people out to the door waiting to be seated which was expected from a restaurant, I guess. We were totally okay waiting 10 minutes to be seated. Once we were seated, with two out of the three menus that were needed, we chatted and noticed that no one had even bothered to ask for our order in 30 minutes--we weren't even saluted by a waitress or given water. It was a bit concerning so, one of us stood up and left to ask if we could get our order taken. After a few minutes, a waitress came to give us our well-deserved water and until what felt like an eternity, came up again with another waitress to get our order. My sister asked if the \"FRESHLY-SQUEZZED orange juice\" was any good. The waitress replied by telling all of us that the supposed freshly-squeezed orange was anything but. Adding to our theme of freshness--or lack thereof, she also told us that all of their sandwiches were pre-made! Meaning that they prepare them well in advance. \"Why am I paying $14 for a reheated sandwich\" is what I asked myself. Finally after another thirty minutes, I alone walked to Kaleidoscope Juicery to get some vegan pastries since Arcadia Farms is falling behind on that among other trends, like having an adequate amount of waiters/waitresses. After a 15 minute walk, we had not received our meals yet. So, we left: hungry, tired, and truly disappointed.",

The strawberry scones were a nice touch. Wish they had a larger coffee selection.  I am rating two stars for service. We waited a very very long time for ordering, getting drinks, getting food and getting the check. I am fairly certain our waitress had some issues one of them being telling us an awful story about another guest. Rule #1 of customer service, don't talk about other customers!  The food came out lukewarm and it was ok. I had a goat cheese and mushroom omelet . I am surprised this place remains a hot spot for \"ladies who lunch\" when there are much better offerings elsewhere.",

Next we have a book club meet and it was my birthday celebration. The ladies had bought me cupcakes and then we were told oh you guys can't bring outside food. No one told you. Blah blah.

Roe and Sophia were wonderful walking us through choices for the menu and arrangements.  They were so helpful, returning calls  promptly and patiently answering any questions.   When there was a cancellation a week before the party, they even moved us to a larger room.   The day of the party, I was able to arrive early to add some ballons and  flowers- although they had lovely arrangements on the table.  We had 18 guests and the room and table looked beautiful. Our server \"Penny\" was very attentive, making sure all the guests were taken care of from beginning to end.   She coordinated everything very professionally. Everyone thought the food choices were perfect and each person received there own \"baby cake\" for dessert. My Mother was overwhelmed.  I was so glad we chose Arcadia Farms for such a special occasion.  Many thanks to the entire team!",

The owner is always adding fabulous gift items in the market, so if you don't know it, they have great gifts for the foodie in your life too.

My mom and I split the breakfast sandwich and the french toast, it was definitely too much food but I couldn't decide and wanted to try both sweet and savory! I'm glad I did, both were excellent. The ciabatta was so fresh and the french toast's custard was scrumptious. Their marketplace was also super cute!

For my entree I ordered their Fresh Berry Crepes; wrap with mascarpone cheese and topped with whipped cream, berries, and candied almonds.  You'd think this was pretty sweet, but instead it was very light and fluffy!  The almonds brought the crunch along with the subtle mascarpone bringing in that after sweetness.  Overall, a solid place for a brunch date or a day with the gals.  I fortunately were with 4 lovely ladies and we had a blast at Arcadia Farms;  guys are welcomed too, but only if you're wearing a bow-tie...wink! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "Two words: coconut cake. Literally the main reason I keep going back to this place. Most recently I had the \"breakfast panini\" which was dry and not pressed as a panini should be. They used to have the MOST AMAZING salmon salad but don't get excited because they took it off the menu. Avoid sitting on the out skirts of the patio as you will be drenched with dripping from the misters. Mimosa was not worth $9- like it's 2018 have a $5 mimosa for me for brunch, I just hiked Camelback. They had ran out of the fresh squeezed OJ so I enjoyed two very average mimosas. Why get two if you are complaining about the price you ask.... YOU DON'T KNOW MY LIFE. Even with the negatives I'll be back because this place is cute, maybe one day the salmon salad will return and coconut cake. Also planning my unconvinced babies shower here. Stay tuned.",

A couple hours beforehand, we made reservations on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FResy.com&s=bc102e7fac0d9c1ad511cac870d3e2e0bc83a2fa8ea590c1e977772d5cf69ca0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Resy.com</a>, so we had a table waiting for us when we arrived. The hosts and our server were very friendly and prompt. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that AFC serves complimentary fruit, pastry bites, and one mimosa for a Sunday brunch. Their menu had a range of dishes and it was difficult to decide on what to get. I ended up ordering the crab cakes Benedict, which was at a fair price (~$20.00). The only thing to be aware of is that the menu states that they kindly refuse to split the check by items and will only split the check in half. Overall, we had an enjoyable experience at Arcadia Farms Cafe and will return again if the opportunity arises.",

We made brunch reservations here for Easter ($45 a pp) and while the food was delicious, the customer service was a disaster. First our waitress took forever to even take our drink orders. So for 15 min we waited just to order a bottle of Prosecco.  To place our food order it took another 30 min. By the time our food arrived (which by the way, my husband had to find another entree because they ran out of his first order) we were onto our second bottle of Prosecco... And I had to hunt someone down for that. My sisters potatoes were cold, and dessert was a debacle because they were out of many things by that time. My father asked to take his dessert to go and they presented him with this (photo below). We paid $350 total. I feel like I'm on the freaking fyre festival documentary right now lol. But seriously this was so disappointing. The waitress we had was a stress ball. She would show up and shout that they were out of something and present the alternatives with sas. They over booked themselves completely. I genuinely like this restaurant Im just blown away by the terrible service. Go on a week day. Not for holiday.",

Upon entering the restaurant my friend and I could visibly see the manager freaking out that multiple parties walked in in a row. We even over heard her say, \"well we are just going to seat them over there and that's how it's gonna be, these servers are going to kill me.\" That is not a great way to walk into a restaurant. Then we sat on the patio and were getting drenched by the misters. We asked to have them turned off and they did for a brief moment and turned them back on. Our service was lacking to say the least. My breakfast panini came and it is not a panini at all, it should just be called a breakfast sand which, it's not pressed served on ciabatta and pretty dry. The only reason I'm giving it 3 starts is for the coconut cake, it's amazing and I would return for just that.  Overall food and service is sub par and it's a little over priced for what you get!",

    "text": "I came here for brunch and encountered maybe the worst management I have ever experienced. My wife and I were told to expect a 25 minute wait with only a single three person party ahead of us and dozens of empty tables around. We decided to wait and then watched as tables were cleared and no one who was waiting got seated.   After a half hour, I approached the desk and asked how much longer it would be. Another couple after us had done the same and then left, leading me to assume that things weren't looking good. I was told that we would have to wait until after lunch which was another 20 minutes. I said this was unacceptable as we had been told 25 minutes and it had now already been 30. The woman who had put our name on the list then said that whoever put us on the list had made a mistake... What?  Apparently they were expecting lots of reservations around noon. All of the  photos of empty tables I included here were taken at 12:30. Those tables were empty when we arrived at 11:00. That is 90 minutes with well over half of the tables in the restaurant sitting empty and no one being seated. The hostess grudgingly told me that she would seat us, but only if we ordered breakfast quickly before they switched to their lunch menu. Great, now their incompetence and negligence to inform us that we would miss breakfast upfront had become our problem. No apology was offered at any point by anyone involved.  Soon after we were seated our waitress came over and prodded us to hurry up and order breakfast. We ordered quickly. A little while later an employee walked up to our table and asked if we were waiting for food. She then asked what we had ordered. At this point I began to feel like I was on Candid Camera. I half expected a TV host to jump out from behind a bush holding a microphone telling me that this was all just an elaborate prank.   Fortunately they had not forgotten our order and our meal was served soon after. I was hoping the food would be good enough to make up for the terrible service, but it was not. The smoked salmon completely lacked flavor and the bread it was served on was nearly stale. The salad with my dish was bland. The only good thing about the breakfast was the fresh squeezed orange juice.   For her part, my wife did enjoy her meal. The jam was good, the eggs were cooked properly, and the bacon was sufficiently crispy, just the way she likes it. But she agreed that it wasn't as good as The Snooze or Butter's/Butterfield's.   The patio is very nice, and the courtyard looks cozy too. We were seated in a small room where the tables felt a little to close together.  We will definitely not be coming back here again. If you decide to eat here, make a reservation and request the patio.",

So sad we weren't able to be there at the same time, but more than happy that Arcadia Farms was introduced to us through their experience! Ahhh... where to begin, this quaint restaurant nestled on a quiet street in Scottsdale! It appears that JoJo felt right at home in this well aquatinted establishment, right down to the scrumptious pastries, and house made sangria! Hubby and I ate lunch here, so sorry, I didn't take pictures of our sandwiches. Luckily I was enjoying \"the moment\" and we Enjoyed our lunch while visiting and talking about how GOOD the food and atmosphere is! Hubby got the baked ham and cheese, IT WAS THE BEST! Better than my roasted chicken sandwich, which was good, but not as good. The bread on both sandwiches was absolutely phenomenal, crunchy on the exterior and soft on the inside! Potato salad that accompanied our meal was rustic and delicious! Okay, I am a Fixer Upper fan, and would follow anywhere Chip and Joanna go, but this place stands on its own merits! It's absolutely Devine!",

    "text": "Today was the last day my girlfriend was in town so we wanted to do a real nice brunch. I know it's Thursday but we love the thought of calling it a brunch as a brunch is just not for the weekend.  We came mid morning and there was only one other party coming in at the same time. What was nice was there were three options of what I considered three places to dine in. One area is outdoors in front of the restaurant, the other area is inside the restaurant and then there was also seating in the outdoor courtyard. We were the first of the 1/2 parties there and we were seated in a very isolated corner adjacent to the outdoor courtyard. At first, I thought it would affect the kind of service we would receive but I was wrong.  Our server was also the hostess that greeted us and she did a great job serving and making sure she was attentive. I wanted to start off with homemade cinnamon pecan rugelah but they were already sold out. The server suggested the pumpkin muffin which came with two little strawberry scones.  We started with the muffin and two house coffees that were served very hot. From the first bite of this pumpkin muffin to the last bite, it disappeared way too quickly as did the very little bite size scones. This was by far the moistest most buttery tasting muffin I ever had. Usually I just eat the muffin tops and leave the rest but this was so good that my friend and I were slicing the muffin in itty bitty pieces hoping that the one muffin would satisfy the both of us. This was beyond yummy and worthy of another order but being on an eating journey from Grassroots yesterday to the movies last night, we decided to behave.  We both ordered the same thing which was the baby spinach and tomato omelet. It was cooked to perfection with the feta cheese and tomato and spinach chunks nicely layered into the omelet and served nice and hot. I ordered the applewood smoked bacon crispy and it was also cooked to perfection. By the time we finished our meal we were full, satisfied and were planning our next return.  Got great service here, the ambiance is incredible and the breakfast has convinced me to return at another time. What a JEWEL of a place. Can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "I debated whether to give 4 or 5 stars to this place. I'd give it 5 as a nice place to go for Ladies that Lunch and a 5 as a memorable place to take an elderly (woman) friend or relative for an outing. It's a 4 for a date because the estrogen level is so high.  The only couple I saw was an older man with a woman that looked like she might be his mother or an aunt. There was no music that I noticed which is nice for older people that might have trouble hearing or concentrating when they're out and about in town.  There are several beautiful patio areas in the front and back. The decor is very tasteful and upscale but not stuffy. The food was very good. One of the things I noticed was the strawberries on the salad were flavorful, not like a lot of strawberries, merely hinting at the flavor of the fruit. The baguette used for my sandwich was high quality with a nice consistency. I hesitated to order a sandwich thinking I'd get a generic type French bread. The salad had the perfect amount of dressing, evenly distributed with some lovely toasted almonds.   There might be a different crowd here for brunch, but again, I see it more as an older lady place than for couples or younger people. Well-worth a visit though, followed by a breeze through at the Marketplace next door. If I was to go again, I'd probably have lunch at the Cafe and dessert at the Market for a slight change of scenery.  When you pay your bill, they give you a 10% coupon for the Marketplace. You can use the coupon for food or coffee as well as gifts next door.",

Some friends and I went here for breakfast on a Sunday only to find out that they stopped serving breakfast at 11 am.  This doesn't make sense.  We decided that we would stay for  lunch.  I decided to split the California Turkey Club with the potato salad  with a friend.  After 45 minutes later, we finally got our food.  The server did stop to tell us that the kitchen was behind but made no offer if we would like some bread to pass the time.  The California Turkey Club was very disappointing.  It was all bread and nothing in the middle.  Very little turkey on this sandwich.  I wish the server would have said how the potato said was made.  It was covered in mayo which did not sit well with our stomachs.  I have been to Arcadia Farms before for breakfast and had an amazing entree and service.  This time the food and service were really lacking.  We received our bill and noticed that we got charged $3 for splitting our plates.  I did not see this on the menu or  the server did not mention to us when we placed the order.  $3 for a can of Diet Coke?!  Why are you upcharging for a can of soda?  I love supporting local places but this place has lost a customer.",

I also just had a private party here in one of their private rooms, and it was fabulous.  Great service, great food, and the event went off perfectly.  We even had gorgeous personalized cookie favors.  The only bad thing I can say about Arcadia Farms is that it's too pricey to eat there every day, otherwise I think I might!",

I called first thing this morning to make a reservation for 11:00 a.m. (and they are open for breakfast so should have taken the call) and had to leave a voice mail.  No one called me back within an hour and a half, so I called again and this time someone by the name of Raphaele (female - not sure of spelling) answered.  I told her I had left a message but hadn't heard back, so she took all of my information and said I had a reservation for 11:00 a.m. as requested. My client arrived before me a few minutes prior to the appointment time, asked if there was a reservation under my name, and she said there was no reservation under my name. The person at the front seated her and when she asked for a different table because the one she was given was tiny, she was told that it will get very busy inside and the only other option was outside.  The restaurant was practically empty.  When I arrived and was also told no reservation existed under my name.  She was very nonchalant when I explained I had called earlier and was given a reservation.  This is very bad customer service, especially since this was a business lunch and I would have liked to have made a better impression.  The goat cheese dip is delicious but my Pesto Shrimp Salad had very chewy and overcooked shrimp in it.  I probably won't return.",

The crepe with bechamel does not come with bechamel, it came with milk on top or so it would seem from the lack of thickness we would associate with a True bechamel. We respectfully asked for something else and were treated to attitude the rest of the breakfast!   Why do servers not realize that an unhappy customer doesn't come back?  Our waitress Janis knew right away we were unhappy but instead of asking, she avoided us. I actually stopped another waitress, who much to her credit, was gracious and polite and offered another choice.  Then when the hostess brought the new dish she plopped it in front of my husband and said \"sorry you didn't like the crepes\" in an extremely disingenuous manner.  Sorry Arcadia Farms, your location may be cute but I'd rather eat soupy crepes at a restaurant that understands the lifetime benefits of making sure customers are happy.  Never coming back!",

My daughter and I celebrated an early Mother's Day here recently. We were seated in just the right spot on the patio to tuck my grandson and his stroller in a corner next to the table. We splurged on some white sangria for lunch.....so pretty it had it's photo posted on Facebook. The Brie and Carmelized apples also came with grapes and strawberries and it was a very large serving of cheese. It could easily be a meal or feed 4 as an appetizer. We actually ran out of bread, because the Brie wheel was a nice large serving. The smoked ham sandwiches on crusty baguette are so good that I am craving them a few days later ....we used the still-warm gooey Brie on them, too. This place is just special! Plan an event, take a guest. It is a spot that will make it memorable. This was my first lunch as a new Grandmother with my daughter. My daughter is from the beach area in SCal, and she was wow'd.

    "text": "This place is like an outdoor garden at someone's great-aunt's home in the Hamptons. We were seated immediately at a wrought-iron table outside under some misters and handed menus. It was a good 10 minutes before our server came out to take our beverage order and the only reason I stayed that long was because my escort excused himself to take a phone call. However, when our server did come by, she was super-nice. My Bee Eff had two eggs with bacon and I ordered some Frenchie-sounding crepe dish with ham and gruyere cheese, \"with a creamy bechamel sauce.\" Another 10 minutes goes by before she drops off our iced tea and orange juice, which are served in those wine-looking water glasses with the stems, and they're both sucked down pretty fast. And then we've got two empty glasses on the table, and no one ever comes back to see if we need a refill. At this point I am periodically checking the time because hey, it's hot outside and we have nothing to drink, and our server is seemingly nowhere in sight! Several minutes pass before she drops off a carafe of iced tea and some waters. Another TWENTY minutes and our food comes out, his is missing toast and mine looks revolting. But I'm really into crepes and I'm pretty open-minded about food so I dive in. Another five minutes goes by before he gets his toast and is told that there is no tabasco sauce anywhere in the building, nor in the building across the street that servers have had to run to in order to get things that are obviously missing from the restaurant (it seems that the company owns both properties but you'd think they would keep all of their restaurant stuff in one convenient location...).  My date's food was \"eh, no big deal. Eggs and bacon... you really can't screw that up.\"  My crepes were the best part of the dish. They were the perfect consistency, thin, no lumps, no weird fried edges. I liked the CREPES. However... I was under the impression that the filling was to be ham and gruyere and it was ham lunchmeat only, not what I was expecting. The crepes were swimming in a watery, milky sauce that needed salt or some other seasoning (not quite the creamy bechamel I was expecting) and the gruyere was sprinkled across the top. So visually, if you can picture this: White cat vomit. But I was starving at that point and I liked the crepes part so I ate it.  And then I wanted to pay and leave. And we couldn't even do that because like the entire experience thus far: no server to be found. Don't get me wrong, I didn't dislike her. I mean, when she did come around, she was one of the nicest servers I've ever had. She was just inattentive to her tables on the front patio. Getting the check took another fifteen and then I was ready to pay and it took so much longer waiting for no one to come back that it got to the point where I had to get up, go inside and stand in the kitchen while someone else rang me up.   Bottom line: Mediocre, overpriced food ($40 for two small breakfasts and no booze), shit service. Not going back.",

Since Arcadia Farms is within walking distance of the hotel and got such great reviews, we decided to give it a try......it was a great idea!  My mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart was fabulous and the accompanying green salad was very good , though a bit overdressed for my taste.  My husband had the ham sandwich with split pea and ham soup, and even though he could find no ham in the soup, it was quite tasty and the sandwich was delicious.  We had no time for dessert, so we ordered a Baby Coconut Cake to go.   Quite frankly, it was to die for!  Plus, it was enough for 3 people, though the 2 of us sacrificed and finished it!  If you find yourself in Scottsdale, give this place a try.  Neither a quick nor inexpensive choice, it nonetheless was a wonderful meal.",

    "text": "Got Corn?  Our local friend brought us to this lovely restaurant after a crazy night of Halloween partying. The breakfast plates everyone ordered looked amazing. But I decided to get the Breakfast Quesadilla. Here's the thing. We all know what a Quesadilla consists of. The proper name should have been Cornadilla. It was all corn. The whole damn thing. One other guy at my table ordered it and we both agreed we had never seen so much corn on one table. I mean if you take the amount of corn in our quesadillas and pulled in a truck to haul it all out, you could probably feed the entire Ohio State team. There was so much corn on both our quesadillas that the table was tilting in our direction. When the waitress came by at the end and we mentioned that the corn was overwhelming she said \"well, sorry.\" We then apologized if we sounded rude to which she replied \"Yeah, you guys are.\" So it was obvious that she also was sensitive to the amount of corn this Quesadilla could somehow hold. It was as if someone had dared the Chef \"Let's see how much corn you can put on something before they realize we're punking them.\"   Anyways, the rest of the food looked great. And the restaurant is beautiful. Oh, last thing....and I swear I'm not making this up. A bird took a dump on me right when I got there.",

I never considered myself  a \"lady who lunches\" but since I am now being classified as \"too old\", I will now refer to myself as a \"lady who lunches\". I might as well start wearing my floral dresses and Sunday hats as well.  This is also the spot to come to on all of the beautiful sunny AZ days, the patio is a fantastic place to sit and enjoy the sun and the accompaniment of your friends. My experience has been that the service is not the best (I had to ask for my creamer to go with my tea twice last time I went) but the food makes up for it. Most every time I go, I have to have the goat cheese and raspberry salad. It feeds my goat cheese addiction. The crab and avocado stack is also pretty tasty. My friend I usually go there with always has the chicken and strawberry salad. I guess the homemade strawberry dressing is \"out of this world\".  If you like lemon, try the lemon sugar cookies. They have the perfect balance.....not overly sweet. Next time I will be sure to wear my Sunday hat.",

    "text": "It's no secret that I'm a huge fan of Arcadia Farms, and when I heard they were going to be opening a marketplace across the street, I was psyched.  Of course, this was many months ago... So when I woke up this morning to see an email in my inbox (thanks Lisa G) saying that they were now open for business, I was very excited and knew immediately where to go for lunch.    Needless to say, I made it a priority to get there asap (I didn't want to miss the opportunity to get the FTR).  While it's different than I expected, I was pleasantly surprised!    The menu is diverse and includes many of the AF signature items such as the Mushroom, Spinach & Goat Cheese Tart, the Strawberry Chicken Salad, and their extraordinary desserts.  In addition, they offer plenty of new options such as a Chopped Italian Salad, a Tuna Nicoise Salad, and a Roasted Artichoke & Ricotta Cheese sandwich.  There is a daily soup, and plenty of breakfast items (think everything from muesli to quiche, muffins, croissants, and granola parfaits).  Arcadia Farms' famous apricot iced tea is also on the menu, as well as a full coffee menu.   I went with the  AF Breakfast Sandwich ($6.95).  It's an MJ English muffin, scrambled eggs, aged cheddar cheese, and your choice of ham or bacon.  They made it with egg whites for me, and it was delicious.  My dining companions had a sandwich and soup, respectively.  Everything is made to-go, but there is plenty of seating outside if you choose to dine there like we did today.    Marketplace offers a simpler fast/casual option for breakfast, lunch, or a comforting snack in Old Town... They use natural, organic, and local products, and it shows.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  I anticipate this being a welcome addition to my \"rotation\" of go-to spots in my 'hood.",

I decided to call on Sunday after they opened and was able to get a reservation for 10:30am. When we arrived we noticed the restaurant was very quiet with several empty tables. We were seated about 10 minutes and no one had come to our table to even bring water. My husband got up and wen to the hostess stand to ask for water. a few minutes later a waitress came by with water and left saying she'd be back. After about 15 total minutes of being there we were finally waited on. Our food was brought out without delay. We shared a iced pumpkin cookie which was delicious; soft and chewy. Their coffee is very good and it is organic. My husband enjoyed his omelet and my mother enjoyed her scrambled eggs. I ordered the wild mushroom tart and although it was tasty it was barely warm and I asked if it was something that is usually eaten cooled. I was told that it is not and although prepped in advance it is cooked when ordered. It seemed as if mine was cooked about an hour earlier even what was supposed to be melted cheese in top was hard. Our waitress was very nice about it and management took it off our bill.  This was our second time here, we really enjoyed our first visit which was Mother's Day but this visit was just disappointing.",

The vintage cottage is is now a charming restaurant filled with clothed tables and a lot of luncheoning ladies.  There was an original Arcadia Farm when the neighborhood was farmland a few decades ago.  The grounds and homestead are behind an adobe wall acorss the street - where a valet does a good job of keeping away looky-loos' preying eyes.    My ham sandwich was delcious.  Crispy. toasted bread and ample filling.  We began with a signature app - the melted brie, topped with roasted apple and surrounded by strawberries.  Then to really complete the arterial damage, we savored a wonderful coconut cake.  Desserts are made each day in the bakery across the street.    Service was good and amusing.  The sun was out, but winds up to 50 mph whipped the courtyard and slammed doors while we ate in the former garage.  A door leads to the kitchen.  The weather plagued the cooks and the bewildered server as they worked to keep the food coming.   Our server kept popping in and out of the slamming kitchen door like a cuckoo in a clock.  Well done!",

We arrived just before 11am on a Sunday, didn't have a reservation, and were told it would be a 30 minute wait.  There were several open tables.  We were visiting from out of town, not familiar with the restaurant and were not told breakfast stopped at 11.30.  We decided to wait seeing the open tables and many others leaving, as we had an event to be at by 12.30.  We were finally seated at 11.27, and given a mix of breakfast menus and lunch menus.  Upon ordering, we asked if we would be able to be done by 12.30 and were told it was unlikely, it is a small kitchen, it would take at least 45 minutes for our food.  We then tried to order breakfast and were told it was no longer being served.  We asked if they could serve it anyway, and were told no, the kitchen was closed for breakfast.  I informed our server we were given breakfast menus, she apologized and said there was a new hostess.  Another hostess came and informed us we could not have breakfast, if we wanted to eat breakfast we should have had a reservation or come earlier.  I told her we arrived early, to which she said it should have been earlier.  We asked if we could get eggs for my niece, who is 3 because she was so hungry.  They agreed to this, and brought it out quickly along with some complimentary scones.  The server refused to charge us, we informed her we were leaving as we couldn't wait that long for food and wanted breakfast.  If we hadn't wasted 45 minutes to be told we would not be served breakfast we would not have waited.  Arriving at 11am with at least five open tables should have allowed us to be served breakfast.  There was little apology or concern by staff, outside our server not charging us for the eggs.    Having worked in the industry, I would never put up with staff who treated customers this way.  The hostesses were rude, condescending, non-apologetic, arrogant, and projected an attitude that they didn't care about the customers.  We also observed the party of four behind us have the same experience and get up and leave after waiting 30 minutes to be told they would not be served breakfast.  If we did not have an event to attend I would have asked to speak with the manager, I have never had such a negative experience.  I chose this place to eat based on positive reviews, I am sure the food is outstanding, but I will not risk the treatment to taste it.  I also understand it is a small kitchen, but 45 minutes for entree's seems ridiculous.",

The service was definitely slow which is the only thing preventing me from giving them 5 stars. It may just be the kind of place that has a more relaxed atmosphere and nothing is a rush. I didn't expect that so I was a bit impatient. Maybe I'll move it up to a 5 star next time knowing that it's a more mellow atmosphere & I should take my time enjoying the amazing food.",

After closing out she did not stop by even ONCE to refill our waters or coffees. There was NO wait and we were the only table in our area.

    "text": "I have been enjoying Arcadia Farms for 20+ years, but never again. Sadly, the management seems to have forgotten customer service. My husband made reservations on Monday for breakfast on Saturday for early Mother's Day. The reservation was for SIX. Our daughter surprised us by flying in for Mother's Day Weekend. We called THURSDAY MORNING to add ONE to our reservation for Saturday. They refused, stating that \"we don't have another chair\". I am an event planner. I have done events at Arcadia Farms. I KNOW they have another chair! Pretentious, much? I could almost understand if we asked to add two or three or more people. But ONE person? With TWO days notice? As an event planner, and someone who has worked in the industry, I would ALWAYS figure out how to accommodate ONE extra person with two days notice because that is just good customer service. Sadly, Arcadia Farms seems to have become so incredibly snobby, that they forgot that it is the CUSTOMER who keeps them in business, and they just lost SEVEN.",

We sat outside on the front porch and had an incredible lunch with 80 degree weather and a nice breeze- one of the first beautiful Arizona Fall days. The food was amazing... had the Greek salad with chicken, Crab cakes, and Chicken crepes. Iced tea was also very tasty! Only downside was a bit slow for service, but service was friendly.  Will be back soon!!",

The cafe has the most \"beautiful\" crepe croquet-monsieur. The crepe was decorated with parsley, tomatoes, and creamy sauce. It looks like a blossoming flower from afar. And it tastes as good as it looks. Breakfast Quesadilla is stuffed with roasted zucchini, bell pepper, and corn. It is fresh but not super flavorful. I am not sure corn mixes well with zucchini and bell pepper.  Note: Reservations are essential for weekends. Also, may not be the first choice for carnivores and families with young kids.",

    "text": "Arcadia Farms is one of my favorite places to chat, gab and grub with good girlfriends :)  The restaurant atmosphere is similar to a ladies tea room, all warm and cozy on the inside, with a beautiful patio out back.  I personally prefer to sit out back and enjoy the lovely AZ weather, but everyone has their own preference, so either way you will not be disappointed.    Same goes for the food; every dish is like a warm embrace. Comforting, warm and so delicious that you cannot help but smile as it consumes your taste buds.  I have yet to eat anything that I have not wanted to order again.  My favorite dishes are the egg strata (breakfast), and warm vegetable salad with chicken (lunch).  The strata looks almost like a bread pudding, but is filled with eggs, cheddar cheese, roasted veggies, and sausage. Holy yum!  Double bonus for having 3 different mimosa options (orange, raspberry, or peach) and fresh baked goods!  I highly recommend dining at Arcadia Farms for a relaxing, comforting day out :)",

There is ample seating indoors (cozy like you're in someone's cottage) or outdoors (like a scene from The Secret Garden). Great location to hold a baby or bridal shower!  We came at 11:45AM and were given the option of brunch (ends at 12PM) or lunch (starts at 11AM). If you're caught in that 11-12PM transition zone, be aware that the entire table must all commit to the brunch menu or the lunch menu. No mixing of the menu items was allowed. I was slightly disappointed that brunch ended so early and not wanting to rush, we decided to all go with lunch.   Regardless, the food was not disappointing. Super fresh from farm to table! We had the warm brie with caramelized apples, trio of bruschetta, warm chopped vegetable salad with chicken, fresh lump crab cakes, and the turkey and brie sandwich.   If you're a salad lover, you will adore this spot!",

The table linens are as fresh and crisp as they were throughout these years that I've been a patron.  The graciousness from the minute one enters the establishment is heartwarming at times,  other times ...pleasant and welcoming. Cocktails over the years have been fresh and crisp and a notch above. The Thai iced tea is in a class all its own. The attention provided tableside is informed, joyful, courteous and organized.  PLA will forever be my top choice. Over the years I've enjoyed many of the salads and many of the entrees. Thai pasta is particularly great for the kids.   Am wishing for dessert surprises ...something unique ...that can be put together quickly with primary prep in the freezer like fried ice cream. I picture little sparklers on the fried ice cream dessert addition .... might be nice for memory making.  Thank you Deirdre and family, \"T Boy\" and the rest of the Malees On Main family for many years of fine dining with heart",

I have been coming here since I was 12 years old, and it seems to have aged like fine wine and only gotten better! I had a lunch date with a girlfriend here today and it could not have been more lovely. We were greeted promptly and seated at a cute table on the back patio. The atmosphere was so relaxing and comfortable, and there was even soft music playing in the background.   Our waitress got us our drinks and took our order in a timely fashion. I ordered the chicken strawberry poppy seed salad and it was incredible; fresh and delicious. She had the greek salad and said it was great as well. Their menu offers lots of different salads, sandwiches, quiches, and appetizers, so there are plenty of options for every mood you are in. We chatted and never felt rushed though our meal which was nice. Our waitress offered us some of their yummy looking cookies and pastries for dessert, but we decided to pass on the calories. Though they all looked incredible if I had felt like indulging I would have lots to choose from!   The only negative thing I would say is that there were a few times our waitress was not around to get more water, but she did eventually come around.   The prices are reasonable, but not cheap. You are paying for local and fresh ingredients after all.   If you are looking for a great lunch place in told town with quality food and lovely ambiance then this is your place!",

You walk in and assume it's a small cramped place, but they more seating in the back patio, and second building made for larger parties beyond the patio. I liked how they brought out biscuits before our meals came out. Biscuits!  They were really accommodating to our needs. They sat us in the second building and made sure we were warm and comfy where we sat. They got one of our orders wrong but were quick to fix it. I ordered the Smoked Salmon plate. I had no idea it came with a side of greens. This plate was really too much for me to eat. There was a generous amount of smokes salmon, that my mom ended up helping me eat this. That's not a bad problem to have though.   I didn't eat any of my side salad. I don't remember ever getting dressing for it. And I had a small bite and it didn't taste like it was tossed in any dressing. Oh well, I wasn't in the mood for eating anything green at that time. Overall I would recommend this place.",

    "text": "This is literally the first review I have ever written. I came here for lunch, and I loved it so much that I arranged my schedule so I could come back the next day for breakfast. Everything was absolutely top notch -- I had the shrimp pesto salad when I went there for lunch and the black bean omelette when I went there for breakfast. Both were delicious!  But it was the atmosphere and the service that got me to write this review. I sat outside both days. The music was sort of acoustic jazzy-sounding covers -- I asked about it and it's apparently a brunch playlist on Spotify -- so there's that. When I was there for lunch, apparently a huge to-go order came in shortly before I arrived and a lot of the meals were delayed. While we were waiting, the waitress came around and gave everyone the most delicious cookie samples -- lemon and chocolate (with caramel, I think) -- to snack on while we were waiting. I was already loving the overall vibe and experience, but I thought that was a great gesture, and it helped that the cookies were so darn yummy.  I wouldn't come here with a toddler unless you know they like that sort of thing, and I wouldn't come if you are looking for a quick bite before you have to be somewhere else. But if you want a dining experience with yummy food, delightful staff and attentive service, this is your place. I went by myself, but it would be a great spot to catch up with an old friend or to hang out with a group of people you love to talk to and enjoy great meals with.",

We sat outside at a little corner table with a cushy booth next to a tree with singing birds.   For starters we ordered a couple strawberry n' cream scones and a chocolate muffin. The scones were to die for. Oh man. Just everything a scone needs to be: warm, buttery, just-a-tad-sweet; perfect. The chocolate muffin was basically cake and also huge, so we had to nibble that one slow.  For a main, I ordered the breakfast quesadilla which comes with fire roasted vegetables, sausage, cheddar cheese, and scrambled eggs inside, with homemade salsa and guacamole on the side. I loved the big chunks of sausage and crispy tortilla. Very satisfying meal when you're as ravenous as I was that morning. I also had a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice to wash it all down. The others enjoyed their mains as well: breakfast panini and an omelet.   We had a 2-year old with us and ordered him the granola parfait which was beautiful! It came in a goblet with a pile of fresh strawberries on the top. So pretty and delicious.   I should add that 2 of us hiked in the 7-Summit Challenge the day before, so we probably would have enjoyed anything considering our enormous appetites, but I still stand by my review. The food is amazing and I will definitely be back!",

It's the kind of place where you need to be ready to help them speed along, like being that person who asks for a check when you're ordering dessert.  Otherwise, you're stuck.  But the food is SO GOOD, guys.  Seriously, so good.  We had a lemon cookie to split for dessert and it was heavenly.  I can see why people would come back to a place like this, where the service is 2-star but the food is 4-star!

Your not told your actually charged this champagne within the brunch. They only have a 'brunch' menu. The least expensive item is $19. They bring you a mini assortment of berries and tiny pastries. The omelette was ok, nothing special and nothing that should cost anywhere near $19. The service is bad. Really really bad. Everything is an issue. Omelette only until 11:30. That was the only thing I wanted. Waitress had to go 'ask' manager. Then, it took forever to get our waitress back to take our order. I ended up grabbing a pitcher of water from a cart because our glasses were empty for a while. Then the check is also a problem. They don't split checks and only accept 2 credit cards. There were so many restrictions that it felt like you were a child in school. The place itself is nice, and could have a really nice ambiance but it's not worth the prices they charge, the very limited brunch menu, nor all the restrictions they put on everything. Then the waitress added her own 20% tip even though the service was no where near worth it. Not worth going back to and definitely won't unless something drastic changes.",

Well, as my friend described it, you are surrounded by groups of clucking hens. That is how he describes the tables full of loud women. I agree, I can only take so much chatter from tables full of loud women, drunk off $15 glasses of wine.  The ladies who lunch & brunch as a profession are here in full effect, so if you can take a restaurant full of them & prices that are slightly too high, come here to enjoy great food & people watching.  Just don't say I didn't warn you. ;)",

The matrons of Scottsdale sit inside, away from the misters.   Everything was fresh, tasty, well prepared, artfully plated, and the service was very good. Hard to go wrong!

    "text": "Arcadia Farms reminds me of Lifetime: TV for Women (and gay men).  On any given Saturday afternoon, it's fun to place bets on how many bridal and baby showers will be going on simultaneously.  This place puts out a siren song for the ladies who lunch.  As a result, the people watching is top-notch.  It's often like having an episode of \"The Real Housewives of North Scottsdale/Paradise Valley\" unfold at the table next to you.  Arcadia Farms is like a shrine to estrogen and it's rare for the BF and me to see more than another man or two in the place, but we don't mind.  The floor show is free, after all.  And if you want the valet to park your car in front of the restaurant, be sure to bring the Bentley.  The decor is one step removed from shabby chic.  It's feminine, but they got rid of most of the frills a few years back.  If the weather is accommodating, the back patio is the place to be.  It's really a lovely setting under the trees.  The small building at the back of the restaurant is usually reserved for the aforementioned bridal and baby showers.    The food at Arcadia Farms is very good.  Don't go expecting gourmet dishes; it's important to remember that at its heart Arcadia Farms is a catering company.  Actually, the BF and I have Arcadia Farms cater our annual holiday party and they do a fantastic job.    For appetizers, the Savory Smoked Salmon Cheesecake is delicious.  The portion used to be way too huge, but now it's been scaled back to a very manageable size as a starter for at least two people to share.  The Crab and Avocado Tower is also a good option, but the tower invariably collapses before it arrives at the table.  The BF and I usually start off by splitting an entree, the Wild Mushroom, Spinach and Goat Cheese Tart.  It is packed with cheesy goodness and comes with a side salad that creates nice contrast.  It splits into a hearty appetizer.  It was a dark day when spinach was pulled from the market and Arcadia Farms couldn't make this tart.  Thankfully, all is right with the world again.  For entrees, the Strawberry Chicken Salad is a classic for good reason.  Where Arcadia Farms manages to find such ripe strawberries year-round remains a mystery to me.  The Oriental Chicken Salad is also delicious.  Whenever I order this dish, I go for the gusto and request an extra side of the peanut sauce as the chicken pieces are luscious when dipped directly into the peanut sauce.  The California Club is a solid sandwich choice.  For me, the focaccia bread is too thick, but you can ask them to substitute another bread.  For something more substantial (and sinful), go for the Chicken, Wild Mushroom and Leek Crepes.  They're fantastic.  This dish also splits well.  Everything on the Arcadia Farms menu is fresh and tasty.  The challenge will be deciding what to order on a given day.  Ask if they have specials as they can be good.  On a recent visit the server went through a very lengthy description of a special salad and then she casually mentioned that they had already run out of it.  The BF and I found that rather amusing.  The signature Arcadia Farms beverage is apricot iced tea and it's quite flavorful.  The one nit is that they don't serve the tea with a straw or an iced tea spoon.  There are no spoons at the table and it's hard to catch your server's attention because they're busy moving from table to table.  So you are forced to stir your iced tea with the blade of your table knife.  The BF and I have talked about this several times while dining at Arcadia Farms and I think one of the servers overheard us the last time because they finally brought our iced tea with spoons.  Perhaps that will be a permanent change as it would certainly be welcome.  Beer and wine are also offered, with the expected restaurant markup.    In terms of pricing, you get a good amount of food for the price.  For a fancy brunch/lunch spot, the pricing is fair.  This place isn't in the cheap eats category, but you could get out of here for $20 per person if you only had a salad or sandwich.  But what's the fun in that?  The desserts at Arcadia Farms are pretty good, but the BF and I never have room for them.  The carrot \"baby cake\" is tasty, but it's big enough that you will need to split it with at least one other person.  Arcadia Farms also offers private luncheons and afternoon tea.  This is really an ideal spot for a bridal or baby shower.",

    "text": "Dining at Arcadia Farms reminds me fondly of the \"L'Idiot\" bistro in the movie L.A. Story, where Steve Martin and the cast enjoy an absurd brunch in a satire-like restaurant and order daft items like \"a half double decaffeinated half-caf, with a twist of lemon\" and \"decaffeinated coffee ice cream\".      Its exactly like this at AC.  Slightly cartoon-y, almost a parody of itself, but kind of charming in a way that makes you realize that you sit firmly on the outside of this demographic.  I find this kind of setting immensely charming, as did Steve Martin, and wryly grinned his way through haute fare and caricatures.    My gf and I smartly decided to pinch our way into Easter Brunch here after failing at Cafe ZuZu (fortunately) and Trader Vic's (thankfully), and ended up having, what can be described as the most exemplary Easter Brunch imaginable; wrought iron bistro table-tops for two, shady oaks, white linen table cloths, brick pathways, french doors, and aproned servers.  Brunch started off with breadrolls and a bottle of Fume Blanc, which was very crisp, but not tart.  A perfect brunch choice.  My gf ordered the raspberry stuffed french toast (which, as selections go, was my first choice, but was nice enough to concede the dish to her) and I chose the Breakfast Bruschetta.  We sipped our wines and waters on a very calm and cool back patio, thankful that we found a perfect spot for such an occasion on the fly.  About 20 minutes later, our meals were delivered and i was immediately satisfied with the presentation.  The bruschetta consisted of egg, sausage, and mozza on french baguette slices.  It was delicious.  The french toast was seasoned perfectly, and the raspberry and strawberries on top were a nice compliment, although, the menu claimed infusion of raspberries, and I could not detect anything resembling that.  The desserts were tempting, but we were satisfied with the wine as a digestif, though we ended up gorging ourselves shortly afterward with mechiladas and Belgian beers at the Vig, anyway, so dessert should have been in order.    Just something to make up for on our next visit.",

My wife is a vegetarian and was pleasantly surprised that there were several items for her to chose.  She had the crape and just loved it!  The salmon dish I selected was a good portion and was cooked to perfection - moist and flavorful.  For desert the coconut cake is a cant miss choice.  We will certainly be back!",

The restaurant has ample seating, both indoor and outdoor, but it might be a good idea to make reservations as it seemed pretty busy on a Friday afternoon...I can only imagine the weekends!  I had the mediterranean melt, which was an assortment of grilled veggies and melted mozzarella sandwiched in between pesto and ciabatta bread with a side of spring greens. I'm typically not a big fan of ciabatta, but in this situation, it complemented the veggies very well. My girlfriend got the chicken quesadilla, which was probably the fanciest queso I've ever seen in my life. Both were plated nicely and tasted as fresh and good as it looked.  Yes, it is on the more pricey side, as each entree ranges from $12-20 but I'd come here again considering the options for cute brunch joints are disappointingly miniscule.",

My girlfriend got  french toast (because she is a bitch and has to be super toned and fit with out working out or eating good) which came with chicken apple sausage. Ok, heres the thing about that, I hate sausage(insert lesbian joke here) but it didnt have the typical sausagy flavors. It was really  really good. It was tangy salty and sweet.  The french toast was extremely good. I think it may have been dipped in blueberry before cooked?  The waitress was super accomodating, and nice.   Oh and they do have french press coffee which I was disappointed by , but after I had it.. holly crap best coffee ever!!!! it was smooth had good flavors, no bitterness at all.   The only use butter and vegetable oil which is soo nice to see they dont load you up with horrible for you margerine.   My only complaint is, I ordered a sandwich and got a totally different one. When I told them she went to the cooks and found out they didnt have that bread and randomly added egg?   She took it back and it was no big deal but she informed me it was only a month old and were still learning the menu.   Kinda weird but nothing big, my new favorite breakfast place.",

We arrived 30 minutes prior to lunch service, but received very prompt turn around on our lunch order nonetheless.  The avocado and crab tower was fantastic.",

We made a reservation and asked to sit inside, the host said it would be about 20 minutes for inside seating even though there were about three visible open tables inside. The host made it seem like we were inconveniencing her. When we asked if we could sit at one of the tables inside she said \"that's a table for 6\" (we had four people).  We sat outside and had a waitress named Janis. She brought out our food order and was snippy when one of the entrees was completely wrong, no apology. When the bill came the item we didn't order was on the bill. We ask her to fix the bill and she comes back saying that she tried to get us a discount but she had to void that transition because she wasn't allowed to give discounts. The receipt just had \"void\" written on it in pen. We waited for the correct bill and the whole closing out took about 25 minutes.  The manager was extremely nice and apologetic. She gave us a couple desserts and said she would take care of us when we returned. Cute place and good food but the management needs to see that some of their employees are bringing it down.",

We had just arrived in Scottsdale after a 22 hour trip and wanted somewhere to sit and relax for a little bit. We came upon Arcadia Farms and took our luck without a reservation. Luckily the hostess helped us out and as we weaved through the somewhat tight seating, I knew this was my kind of place. She led us out on to a back patio and in to another little seating area where there were women talking over glasses of white wine and amazing look lunch dishes.          We sat and were brought water and offered Apricot Iced Tea--of course I chose to try it, it sounded fantastic (and I wasn't disappointed). After looking over the menu (and having a hard time deciding) I chose to try the Pesto Shrimp Salad, while my mother got the Turkey and Brie sandwich. Both were phenomenal, the pesto and the shrimp were both spot on to make a simple salad more flavorful and exciting. It was a perfect light meal after a long, long car ride.",

I stand by my previous review but am upgrading them to 4.5 stars. They are on the pricey side but I just love a restaurant that is designed for women. So much so I think I'll start a list.  This time I had the California club. Absolutely delicious. I opted for the potato salad on the side and it was really yummy. Gabi had a salad which was too big to finish and it looked very good as well.  We sat on the back patio and it was just lovely. This place has a great deal of outdoor space but it's secluded. None of this \"yeah, it's a patio - just try not to breathe the exhaust fumes\" mentality that restaurants are so fond of in the valley. So we enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and the catchiing up. The catching up most of all.  And since I'm a temporary transplant to Scottsdale I just love how there's loads of wonderful stuff right in my own backyard.",

I'll start by saying I added one star because it really is just a lovely place, it's too bad the food is so average, and that's being generous.   I got an iced tea............So over brewed and way too strong, almost bitter.   I ordered the Pesto Grilled Shrimp Salad (see pics) marinated and grilled shrimp, baby lettuces, diced avocado, baby tomatoes, goat cheese, grilled corn and lime vinaigrette topped with frizzled tortillas, sounds delicious no?   No is right! Seriously the vinaigrette was all oil, no lime or acidity at all, there wasn't enough of anything on the salad to get a good bite of all the flavors bland as they were, and the fried tortilla strips were old and very greasy, really a $14 salad should be nothing less than divine.   My daughter got the Albacore Tuna Salad Sandwich (see pics) $12  albacore tuna, pecans, jicama, scallions, cucumbers and purple cabbage on sunflower , whole wheat bread with potato salad.   Again sounds Delicious but was less than stellar.   The Tuna mixture had a decent flavor but the tuna wasn't even mixed thoroughly, it was in large chunks straight from the can.   The potato salads potatoes were barley done, almost crunchy and lacking any flavor that would make me want to continue eating nearly raw potatoes.   The atmosphere isn't enough to intoxicate my senses into believing I'm eating something amazing. How unfortunate that so many can be blinded by a \"trend\" because the food is just not all that.",

This little cafe is nothing more than one banquet room and a long patio of small tables with a gorgeous courtyard out back. My experience may have been different than normal dinning because we had the main room reserved for 20 some odd people and a set menu, so I cannot comment of normal day-to-day service. But I can tell you the banquet service was superb and very attentive and detail-oriented.   Beautiful place settings accompanied the sunny atmosphere in the little room that allowed us have a small table in addition to our long tables for sitting. The food was simply delightful. The light toast with brie and mimosas to the lunch we had. I had the salmon salad and although I wish it'd had a little more potatoes, it was very good and the salmon was cooked just right.   As for dessert, we got a heaping cylinder shaped slice of red velvet cake that wa by far the best red velvet cake I have ever had. I would like to go back here for brunch with my mom or a girlfriend and just enjoy the scenery and the good looking wait staff again. So cute!",

    "text": "This morning was my first time at Arcadia Farms.  The Good: Julia, our server was super sweet.  We got to sit out on the back patio which was full of umbrellas so there was plenty of shade on a beautiful day.  I ordered the French Toast that came with chicken apple sausage, it was decent, but cold as you will see why as you continue reading.  The Not So Good: One of the gals in our party ordered a veggie sandwich off the lunch menu and it was explained to us that she would get her meal a few minutes after the rest of us who ordered breakfast.  I guess if we wanted breakfast we had to order before 11 and after that is when the lunch menu kicks in. So we all gave our order just at 11.  We all received our meals and since the gal who ordered a veggie sandwich was going to get hers a few minutes later, I waited to start eating until she got hers. Well, 10 min went by and nothing, was told it should be any second. 30 minutes went by and she still had not received her VEGGIE sandwich.  I started eating my cold food which I guess is my fault that I waited for the other gal to get her VEGGIE sandwich, was just trying to be polite.  I saw plenty of other people who sat down after 11:00 that got their sandwiches. An hour and 10 minutes went by ....no VEGGIE sandwich.  We called Julia over and told her to cancel the veggie sandwich.  Either the manager overheard it or Julia had told him what was going on cause he finally came by and said he was sorry and that it was coming out.  The gal who ordered it said she didn't want to wait for it. The manager said he would take care of it and get it for her to go.  In addition to this, one of the omelets that came to the table had a long black hair cooked into it.  She sent it back, of course and she got another one.  The manager did not come to the table and talk about the hair omelet and nothing was done with her bill. The Good (cont.): Julia, again, was very sweet and apologetic about the sandwich not coming out.  We kept telling her it was not her fault cause she's not in the kitchen making the food.  She did offer some bread and butter to our foodless friend but she said no thanks. Julia  did bring some \"peace offering\" scones so she had something to eat. That was very nice of her to do that.  She also was nice enough to do separate checks for 6 of us.   I'm not sure if I will go back.  I really don't know why a veggie sandwich took an hour and 15 minutes. Nothing was grilled or cooked on this. Should not have taken that long.  The hair in the omelet, it happens but it should have been discovered before it got to the table, the hair was smack in the middle on top of the omelet.  If I decide to give them a second try, I do hope Julia is my server.   I'd give 5 stars to Julia and the atmosphere. 1 star for the food and experience.",

    "text": "I took a chance on Arcadia Farms for my birthday lunch today and I'm so happy I did!  It was a wonderful meal.    Atmosphere = *****  I've been wanting to go here for a while, having driven by once on my way from Daily Dose - it was love at first sight.  I was beckoned by the wine colored awning and cream umbrellas, invited by the small front patio dotted with greenery.  Just walking into the entrance is a treat.  The interior is so sweet and cozy, very feminine with a touch of beach cottage feel.  The back patio looks gorgeous and wonderfully shady - I will definitely request a table out there next time I visit.    Service = ****  Service wise, no complaints.  Our waitress was very pleasant and handled our meal fluidly, if not with a lively personality.  There were three of us, no special orders, dining in the afternoon during a slow period (the place was a little less than half full), so there's your grain of salt.  Food = ****  Okay, now - the FOOD.  Namely, the Chicken, Wild Mushroom, and Leek Crepes.  I love me a savory crepe, and these blew me away.  The filling also had goat cheese (for the win!), and and the whole thing was covered in a basil beurre blanc.  The basil was a different sauce that had been swirled over the beurre blanc - so pretty!  And the perfect portion - ample, not skimpy, not too filling.  Best thing I've eaten out in a while!  Everything else we ordered was solid - tasty and and fresh, but for me, the crepe dish rose above the rest.  Still, all was delicious, though there were a few little things that could be worked on, in my opinion.  The noshing bread provided was yummy, but could have been a bit warmer (time of day has an influence on that, of course.)  The Crab & Avocado Stack was light and refreshing, a great starter.  The Baked Goat Cheese could have used a seasonal fruit accompaniment, since the crostini ran out before the dip did.  The Pesto Grilled Shrimp Salad had great flavors, but was a little dry and had a touch too much lettuce to toppings ratio.  My friend's Warm Chopped Vegetable Salad was not particularly pleasing to the eye and I didn't take the opportunity to taste it, but she said it was delicious.  Also, we slurped down a sweet little vat of white wine sangria, which was a little weak for my taste, but still really enjoyable.  I think it would be at its best on a hot summer day.  I'm going back to try the breakfast soon, and I'm looking forward to checking out their marketplace across the street!",

My hubs is a cheese connoisseur (that or he just eats A LOT of cheese) and he even raved about how good the brie was.  I then had the warm chopped veggie salad --- mouth watering and flavorful! The hubs had the crab cakes - of which I snagged more than one forkful. Those too were delicious.  The atmosphere is adorable - cozy, like a friend's home. The service was great as well - if you are looking to grab a bite for lunch in Old Town, you gotta stop here.",

I've also had a few salads that I enjoyed. However, the one time I ordered a sandwich, I ended up throwing the whole thing away. It was that bad. Don't order the one with chicken, brie, onions and bacon. yuck. (surprising - because I love all those ingredients)!  Anyhow, if you're looking for a quick lunch - this isn't it (unless you get their pre-made salads). Their sandwiches take forever (i.e. 15 minutes and no one in front of you)! And I even waited a long time for soup the other day.  I will be back for more baked goods and salads. Hopefully I'll get to try their breakfast menu one of these days too. Super cute place, perfect for lunching with a girlfriend.  PS - On a recent long wait, they even gave me a free peanut butter cookie. So at least they recognize that.",

If you are even a few minutes late, they will give your table to people that are waiting and tell you to go to their marketplace. Yup, that happened to us.  We waited for a few members of our group before walking in together and waited in a line for the hostess. Parking is not the greatest so some of us had to walk a bit from our cars. We were about 5 minutes late when we got in line and by the time we got to the hostess, it was 9 minutes past our reservation time. She seemed a bit flustered and by the time she decided to tell us she gave up our table, it was 10 minutes past. Most restaurants would hold your table for 10-15 minutes. She told us we could get food from their marketplace but we actually wanted to enjoy a nice sit-down meal. I mean... that's why we had a reservation. She decides she can seat us after looking at the restaurant. I thought it was especially odd because they had a bunch of empty tables indoors and outside the entire time we were there.  Anyway, we get sat and never had anyone greet us at the table for 10+ minutes. I stopped a server to ask if we had a server and they said yes and our server walked past to let us know he would be over soon. The hostess sees our table (after 15 minutes) without any waters so she grabs us some. We were a bit distracted because we were catching up but I definitely noticed the timing.   3 of us order mimosas and it took a bit longer because they ran out of fruit and flutes. We end up with wine glasses, which was totally fine.   We decided to start with the bread pudding and it was actually pretty yummy! I believe it was made with croissants. We also ordered a chocolate croissant to share and I wished it was flakier and less chewier.  For my entree, I went with the wild mushroom, goat cheese & leek tart. I saw it on Yelp prior to our brunch so I had been eyeing it up all morning. It showed up overcooked but I ate it (See photo). I was starving. It came with some breakfast potatoes and fruit. I wouldn't order it again based off my experience.  The others enjoyed their meals. One of us got the Egg Strata Cobbler and I enjoyed a bite of it so if I decide to give this place a try again, I would get that. Another went with the Breakfast Quesadilla and she liked it. The birthday girl got the Wild Mushroom and Chive Omelet.    Our server was actually really nice but we could tell he was a bit flustered. He brought the birthday girl a cute cupcake with a candle and extra utensils to share but we were all so stuffed. This place is a big 'maybe' on my list to be revisited because I had heard so many good things before my visit.",

Before we even ordered they brought us bite sized scones that were to die for. They almost tasted like a biscuit but more flakey like a scone. Their mimosa menu has so many good juice selections. I had mango and it was delicious. My friends got strawberry and it was very refreshing. For food I had the Mushroom goat cheese omelet and my friend got the breakfast quesadilla. Both were delicious. The egg to mushroom and goat cheese ratio was perfect. The side of breakfast potatoes made it the quintessential breakfast plate. The breakfast quesadilla was packed with veggies and cheese. It came with a green and red salsa to add even more flavor. So yummy!",

The menu offers all your typical fare- omelets and pastries in the morning, sandwiches and salads in the afternoon. The pastries looked and tasted delectable. Our complimentary berry scones were buttery, dense with the perfect amount of tenderness. For my entree I chose the wild mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart. It was a sizable portion, served with seasoned potatoes and fresh fruit. The tart itself was a punch of flavors and textures. I gobbled it right up along with those potatoes and fruit! I liked all the components of the tart, from the flaky buttery crust, the different cheeses, and the earthy flavor of the mushrooms and spinach. The potatoes were well seasoned and soft and the fresh fruit consisted of pineapple and strawberry.  If you dine outside it's cute to see all the sparrows perching and flitting around your table. I think they are really keeping their beady little eyes on any leftover plates or scones though!   Service was decent. Drinks were refilled as needed.   The tart was $12 which I thought was reasonable given the quality and size of my dish.   The only real negatives I could find were that some of the outdoor patio cushions for the chairs looked like they could use a good cleaning. There's also a small parking lot at the Marketplace but chances are you'll be parking on the street. Spots can get filled up if there's an event going on, plus the general fact it's in downtown Scottsdale.  I did spy a sign that said they offer afternoon tea on the weekdays too so I may have to come back and try that out sometime!",

We can feel the love in the environment and in every bite. I've been here once before for brunch, which was also fantastic, but this was so special i had to write about it. Shout out to Brian, who made it his personal mission for us to have a phenomenal experience, and he did not disappoint. Highly recommend, and will be back again.",

I choose the delicious salmon, it was over basil balsamic potatoes and spinach. Yum yum  as a palate cleanser they had served us fresh fruit in a cute martini glass with a side of scones. We finished our meal with a delicious decadent mini tuxedo cake. It was very regal and beautiful of all the presentation. Our server Rasheeda was excellent, she was very patience since we are a party of 20 ppl! She handled all of us with such respect and politeness. She deserves a recognition. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Sadly we had issues with parking and space. That means they should expand",

I held a special event brunch in the room and it was perfection to say the least.  There is a brunch menu that you're able to choose items for a plated meal.  With options that are yummy like the French toast and parfait to a more savory choice of frittata or quiche.  The photos attached are an example of a 20 person seating arrangement.  Highly recommend considering hosting your next private event with Arcadia Farms!",

    "text": "I'm writing this review as a cautionary tale to all that dine at this restaurant with food allergies. I emailed this incident directly to the restaurant and did not receive a response.  On 6/28/2019 I dined in this restaurant with 2 of my friends when I was visiting. I used to frequent Arcadia Farms whenever I was in town--I'm sad to write this review as I used to love this restaurant.  We arrived at the restaurant and were greeted by the manager, Brian. We ordered our food and I notified my server of my peanut allergy. She acknowledged it, wrote it down and said she would let the kitchen know. I ordered a Cobb salad. When our food arrived, I poured the dressing on my salad and after a few bites started to feel swollen and realized I was tasting peanuts. My friends both tried the dressing and agreed they tasted peanuts in the dressing. I immediately had to run out of the restaurant to find medication as I didn't have it with me. Thankfully I did not go in to anaphylactic shock. On our way out we asked if anyone had any Benadryl because I was having an allergic reaction to peanuts and our server heard us from behind the host stand and exclaimed \"I told them and wrote the allergy on the ticket!\" My friend that remained at Arcadia Farms after we left said she waited at the table for a several minutes before the manager, Brian, came over and continuously told her the cutting board was clean and there was no cross contamination. She repeatedly told him it was the dressing. He said they did not know what was in the dressing and had to email the head chef. He was frantic, and kept asking if I was okay, said he would cover the bill, and reimburse us for the Benadryl (they did cover the bill, but we were not reimbursed for the Benadryl nor were we asked for our information). When my friend left the restaurant she finally was told that they made a mistake, my salad had the wrong dressing on it.   Our trip has was cut short because of this incident and we lost money spent on plans we made and on our hotel. I felt the staff handled this in a frantic and unprofessional way. I hope Arcadia Farms resolves whatever missing process led to this mistake, and they do not put any more of their customers' lives at risk.",

My fellow bridesmaids and myself walked from Hotel Valley Ho (less than a ten minute walk) to enjoy an after wedding breakfast. Delicious coffee? Check. Cute mini strawberry scones? Check. Delicious affordable brunch options? Check. I had the pleasure of eating the breakfast quesadilla outside under the warmth of a gas heating lamp and cute hummingbirds flying by the flower beds outside. The breakfast quesadilla was filled with chorizo sausage, fire roasted vegetables including corn, cheddar cheese and scrambled eggs, served with oven roasted potatoes, and side of homemade salsa that was a spicy kick. The menu mentions a side of guacamole but I never received that. My companions dishes also looked amazing and delicious. They ordered the baked French toast and the Crepes Croque-Monsieur. My friend did say that her Crepes Croque-Monsieur was not very warm, but still tasted great. I would definitely revisit this location and would be intrigued to try some of the baked goods that I saw in the window. I highly recommend making a reservation in advance though.",

The salads are off the hook and the mushroom goat cheese quiche was the best I ever had.   The environment is very cute and makes you feel like you are having brunch in someone's back yard. And the desserts are fantastic, especially the coconut baby cake and the almond croissants!  Definitely try! You won't be disappointed",

So cozy.    - Crab & Avocado Tower $13.00 - delicious.  Crab was tasty and meshed well with the avocado and salsa. - Warm Brie with Caramelized Apples $13.00 - How can warm brie and caramelized apples ever be anything but good? - Strawberry Chicken Salad $14.00 - Was a bit too tart for us. We didn't finish this dish although we've been told it's their most popular salad. - Chicken, Wild Mushroom and Leek Crepes $15.00 - this was pretty tasty and we gobbled it up.  There was still sauce leftover and we were offered bread to sop up the sauce, but we were too full. - Wild Mushroom, Spinach and Goat Cheese Tart $14.00 - pretty good but after several bites, it does start to get a little heavy from the goat cheese. - Warm Grilled Rosemary Ham Sandwich $13.00 - this was probably my most favorite out of everything we shared.  The bread was fresh and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The whole mustard aioli completed the sandwich.    This place is definitely cute and a perfect place to go with your girlfriends.  It would also be a great place to host a bridal or baby shower.  They also have private rooms across the street and if I remember correctly, a bakery across the street, too.    Staff overall was friendly, but the hostess who sat us, Polly stood out the most as she was friendly, cheery and informative.",

    "text": "I can't remember the last time I've had such a picturesque brunch. The patio at Arcadia Farms is absolutely beautiful, and it almost reminded me of the times I had brunch in Key West (which, trust me, is definitely a good thing.) Our group of six grabbed a round table on the patio under a huge tree, and it almost felt like we were brunching in a treehouse. In case you can't already tell, I really loved my experience here.  The coffee was strong and much-appreciated after a long travel day the day before, and the iced tea had something fruity going on which was quite refreshing. The menu is pretty big and I was happy to see so many unique items. And can we just talk about the warm strawberry shortcake? I wanted to, but I decided to be \"good\" and go with something a little healthier.  I ordered the mushroom and chive omelet with goat cheese, and added tomato and spinach. I loved how fresh everything was and how generous they were with the vegetables! I subbed fruit for the potatoes but they gave me both (dammit.) I ended up being happy to have a few potatoes along with the great spread of fruit. It was a really healthy, happy & colorful way to start the day! Service was a bit slow but this isn't a place you go to for a quick meal. Visit, enjoy, and definitely score a seat on the patio.  Awesome place. I hope to visit again sometime soon for that cake!",

Breakfast potatoes are good but I'm not a huge fan of rosemary. I love restaurants that offer cottage cheese as a side.   Coffee is good and they serve you little sconces to start. Coffee cake is also yummy.   Everything I've had here is good! Breakfast quesadilla is also yummy - salsa has a good kick.   I noticed that sometimes it's hard to make a reservation online but the restaurant usually isn't full. Don't be afraid to walk in for a tabe.",

    "text": "We recently moved to Arcadia and we discovered this charming little spot. The food is good and the waitresses are very nice, and of course the strawberry scones are a favorite as well. The reason I cannot give it more than three stars is the hostess.  Her service (or lack thereof) has only gotten worse. She hardly ever greets you with a good morning or a hello and when she does speak to you she doesn't make eye contact and just asks \"how many?\" Followed by a \"Follow me.\" If you look up the definition of \"hostess\" she surely does not fit the bill. Seeing as the hostess of an establishment sets the tone for your initial experience, a business (especially one as busy as this one) should make customer service a top priority. She also seems overwhelmed with answering the phones, checking table numbers and seating. Bottom line, if she has to be there, at least get a second hostess to divide the tasks. A reminder to smile, greet and be hospitable wouldn't be a bad idea either.",

Our meals consisted of a ham and and cheese sandwich, a tuna salad sandwich, an herb roasted chicken sandwich and a mushroom, spinach, goat cheese tart. The sandwiches were all served with potato salad. Everything was homemade, fresh and delicious. We all opted to take dessert to go, which was equally fresh and delicious.

My group shared peach bellinis, fresh squeezed orange juice, strawberry scones, and chocolate croissants. Our consisted of the two eggs with potatoes and bacon, the goat cheese, spinach and tomato omelette, and the breakfast bruschetta.  In short, everything was \"fine\" but nothing was delicious.  The breakfast potatoes had zero flavor--they seemed like sliced fingerling potatoes that were roasted in olive oil and nothing more.  The omelette was, like everything else, fine but nothing special and I could have made it at home. I really wanted to like Arcadia Farms with its farm to table philosophy, cute patio, and French pastries, but the food fell short of my expectations.",

My wife & our friend had shrimp salads, which had fresh good greens, but like my Greek salad, didn't have much else besides the 4 shrimp, which were tasty. All salads had sparse dressing. We'd have liked bread, but wasn't offered. Pricey, but good ambiance. Place was jam packed with women. Only 3 of us males-never seen anything like that but that's nothing against the place. I stopped for a Snickers on the way back. We won't be back.",

Once we were seated, the service was so terrible that we left before eating our meal.  Have dined here multiple times.  Just cannot take the poor service and generally stuffy, \"wealthy grandmother\" like atmosphere any longer.",

The cute cottage interior coupled with the umbrella-garden patio make the perfect ambiance for brunch with the girls (it's in fact our weekly ritual).  Not exactly a man's great escape - every time I go (which is more than often) there is undoubtedly a bridal or baby shower in process. But if you men only try the food, I'm sure you won't mind the gaggle of women.    I recommend the goat cheese appetizer to start, and the chicken and leak crepes - to die for.  Though just about everything I've tried has been outstanding, I don't think you can go wrong. They also offer a mimosa special: a bottle of champagne and orange juice for $20, but you have to ask for it.   Bon-a-petit!",

    "text": "Every time I go to Arcadia Farms, I like to engage in a little fantasy (totally G rated)...  ...I'm a lady who lunches, knows nothing about the challenges of the daily workplace grind, and has the time to sip mimosas for 3 hours each afternoon (the mimosa element is really part of a broader alcohol fantasy that I should get checked out)...also, you should know that I'm always wearing a gigantic, Kentucky-derby style hat in this scenario.   While the fantasy isn't likely to be my reality anytime soon, I love Arcadia Farms for having created a cozy and charming atmosphere that inspires just this sort of harmless day dreaming. The restaurant itself if small, which adds to the French country/shabby chic feel. The patio is beautiful and has a quaint garden feel. When you're there you'll immediately notice that the \"ladies who lunch\" fantasy is actually a reality for many of the patrons.  The food is lovely, which is exactly how food should be at this type of place. One of my favorites is the pesto shrimp salad, and the warm vegetable salad is a close second. If you're in the mood to splurge, order one of the mini cakes - you'll be glad you did. Arcadia Farms is as famous for fabulous pastries as it is for salads, sandwiches and tea.   When you're next at the Phoenix Art Museum, keep in mind that Arcadia Farms has another location there, though it is somewhat different. Similarly delish menu, but the atmosphere is much more streamlined and modern to fit the feel of the museum. While I love the original location the most, the museum location is a great treat when you're downtown.",

Seems I arrived approximately twenty minutes prior to closing, I should've known something was up when I got a parking space in front of the (open) front door - Anyway - I go in, there is one couple and one guy waiting in line - I patiently wait my turn, easssy ten minutes browsing the shop, its cute, small, few gifty trinket type items around, but I wasn't looking for a big box.  Once it is my turn to order I ask what the special are, the blonde at the register tells me that they do not offer Saturday specials,,,interesting I think to myself,,, I wonder why there is a very large \"Today's Special\" sign out front. I proceed by trying to order a pressed chicken sandwich, she pauses, quite a pause, then stops waiting on me during this pause to take two to go boxes from another employee ( I figured for the couple who were perusing their iPhones at the nearby table) She then asks the guy (clearly the sandwich maker) for a pressed chicken sandwich???? Formed as a question,,,,Can she have one??? Pressed Chicken??? It was as if she was confused,,,is this a restaurant? Do I take customer requests off of a menu and place an order??? Now I'm wondering...hmmmm, isn't it on the menu? I am aware its not a special because quite frankly she has already schooled me in that dept...sandwich maker guy says nah, sorry, we are out of chicken. Right then,,,,I decide to go to La Grande -  Might be back someday but doubt it.",

    "text": "Dear Arcadia Farms, When someone makes a reservation for 11 a.m. and says that want to order the breakfast menu, why does the person who takes the reservation say it's OK if it isn't? We arrived for our reservation, were given the lunch menu, asked for the breakfast menu, were told that they stop serving breakfast at 11, not given the option, as well as being informed that the kitchen is \"really backed up\". Did that mean that there was only one cook working? Because half the tables were empty. Our waitress couldn't have cared less when we told her that we were told we could order breakfast when we made our reservations. Truly, I could have laid on the floor choking on my own tongue and she probably would have stepped on me to get back to the kitchen. I give you 3 stars, not because of your so-so tart (and the only item available on both breakfast and lunch menus, lucky us!) but because of the carrot cake. My God that was good, so you've got that going for you. But really I could get edible carrot cake anywhere, and don't need to eat it at your restaurant.",

As soon as our server got our drink order, I ordered a cheese quesadilla for my toddler.  I also ordered a cheese plate for appetizer.  My friends' appetizer orders came so I asked if my cheese plate was coming.  Server said I thought you wanted it with your lunch entree.  Ok fine I guess I have to specify I want my appetizer served first?!?!! My main entree came but my cheese plate and my toddler's quesadilla still haven't arrived!  I asked to cancel the cheese plate and he said it is already ready, he just need to bring it out.  It was obviously not ready because it did not come until about 10-15mins later.  Finally, we've asked for our checks to be split and he said it would be too hard to do!  So basically a NO!  And because we had a big party, we were automatically charged 20% gratuity.  I will never recommend this place.  Food is ok, nothing great to rave about.  Service is awful!",

However, when we arrived at 9am we were promptly told they were closed and wouldn't be opening for service until 9:30am due to the \"holiday.\" We chose this place because of the ambiance so it was a good option for mothers day. We had three people total and were the first guests to arrive at the restaurant. Despite this, we were immediately denied service for not having a reservation and given no other option. This place failed miserably in terms of customer service, and for a place with this price point and expectation, their professionalism and hospitality was severely lacking. In the restaurant business a certain amount of personalized accommodation is necessary to build and uphold your establishment's reputation. Instead we got bombarded with excuses from the three snooty girls at the front desk. I have eaten here previously and the food was sub par, I only returned for the ambiance and the good bakery for mothers day. This desire was quickly eliminated once my family and I were treated like yesterdays trash.",

Note that you would not find Anthony Bordain here  I was not dragged her by my wife...I was STARVING the morning we went so I was open to just checking it out...and I'm glad i did.  If you can get past  the oh-to-well-appointed interior design, you will eat some good food.  We started with the baked brie....burp...a lot of cheese, but good. I followed with a chicken crepe which was great and my wife had their strawberry chicken salad.  Apparently all items we ate are well known from the menu...and it was obvious why...all were great.  To top the lunch off, we split a piece of red velvet cake from their bakery across the street.  The cake was really good...but i suggest splitting it to avoid a super sweet sugar high...and crash.  Dudes, if you need a \"foofy\" place to take your woman to show your \"finer tastes in life\" side, this place fits the requirements...and it tastes good too.",

We needed place settings, we had to get up to ask. We wanted to order, we needed to get up to ask. Additional napkins, had to get them ourselves. When the meals came we were one short, assuming it was on its way, it took 10min for our server to come out for us to let her know. The table was completely done eating and my wife's meal still had not been brought out. When it did come, it was brought out by a different server and when my wife asked if she could get a refill on her coffee she said, \"I guess I can do that.\" With service like we were having, sarcastic jokes should be avoided, it just came off as rude. Our server finally came and apologized for forgetting to put in my wife's meal. I have to say we were a table of 4 plus a toddler who didn't order, not a large party, but at least she was honest about the mistake. It took another 20min to pay the check with our server finally coming out with our copy to sign, without my credit card. She asked if it was brought out to me already, knowing it hadn't, then running back it to find where she placed it. The place was semi full for breakfast but still plenty of open seating and well staffed so our breakfast should not have been the hour and forty five minute production that it was. Overall the worst SERVICE we've had. Food was pretty good, but good food is super easy to find these days.",

For a second choice, I think we won. The breakfast here was A-1. Service was great. We sat outside ( I want to revisit this later), the decor is great, outside seating front and back. Now, the brunch is served acorss the street later in the day. We had the cafe breakfast. My co-pilot and I got some peach mimosas (not too many) and Egg Strada Cobbler (Cheddar over eggs with roasted vegetables, creme freche, and this very lean sausage). We also had the mushroom leek quiche, which was this awesome pastry shell with pungent veggies and spinach. Both very filling, The fresh fruit was awesome. So, no complaints on the food, service, anything. Why no 5 stars? You ask. WELLLLLL, that lush greenery on the patio comes along with it's share of lurking predators, known on the East Coast as the \"skeeter\". We were eaten whilst we ate and left there covered with mosquito bites. I am not talking a few. I am talking 10-20 bites each on our legs. And the Arcadia Farm mosquito is not a weak one, it is a flesh-swallowing mutant...so- spray with OFF! if you're going to sit outside. Don't say I didn't warn you,. THE FOOD, THOUGH IS WORTH IT!",

We decided to go to poison pen across the street (which is awesome BTW) and they recommended Arcadia farms.  So head over, wait around for the hostess for a minute and take a seat in the back patio. The place is very...pretty? for the lack of a better word, definitely a good spot to take a lunchoen date to.  The bread was good that they gave us, little cheese crust on it. Had the apricot iced tea and it was quite alright. I asked for the cheese selection list and our server said they were out of one of the cheese's, so I made my selection and a couple of minutes later she came back and told us that they were out of 2 of the three cheese's that I had chose, so I just scraped the whole cheese idea and went with the California sandwich.  My friend had the ham and cheese and he said it was good, he ordered the soup of the day with his entree, which was butternut squash, it tasted like brown sugar candy liquid with little cubes of unseasoned butternut squash, couldn't finish it.  We ate our sandwiches and had half of them boxed up. our server asked us if we would like to see there dessert menu since that was what they were really known for. I said sure, she dropped them on the table, After looking at our dessert menus for 18 minutes our server shows up and asks us if we had made a decision, I said I had made several, But all I really wanted was the check.  So the food wasn't bad but it wasn't great, Maybe the desserts are great but i'll never know. In my opinion this place is an upscale applebees, just an extremely boring menu of sandwiches and salads, made with better ingredients.",

    "text": "Arcadia Farms is one of my favorite places for brunch.  Especially for getting together with the girls.  This is not to say it's a \"man-free zone,\" but, it is super cute.  It has a cozy English country garden kind of atmosphere inside, and on the patio.  Not only is the motif absolutely beautiful, but the food is super yummy too.  My personal favorite, from the lunch menu, is the Raspberry Salad with Fossil Creek Goat Cheese.  It's delicious and refreshing.  All I would add is that in my opinion, one goat cheese medallion is more than enough.  Thus far though I really haven't gone wrong ordering anything off their menu, it's all been wonderful.    I definitely recommend this as an ideal place to relax, chat, and enjoy some delicious food.",

I am saving the lemon cake cookie for the twins.  I hope it is still available after their nap.  I didn't get a sandwich but I am sure coming back to check them out for lunch.",

    "text": "Not Happy. That's how I felt after Easter brunch yesterday at Arcadia Farms. We decided to go to Arcadia Farms for brunch on Easter, having made a reservation about 2 weeks in advance. We decided on this restaurant because it was somewhere new to take my Grandma, but mainly because they advised us they would be serving their regular menu at slightly higher prices, not doing a buffet. Needless to say, I was surprised when we arrived and regular menu was NOT available and there was a $20 brunch buffet. Since neither my Husband or myself are eating bread, this posed a problem considering basically it was pastries and omelets for the buffet. Well, since we were there and my Grandma is disabled, we really couldn't just pick up and go to another restaurant leaving us paying over $60 for not very much food.   I felt like the servers were extremely apathetic and not very pleasant. They sat us all the way in the back of the restaurant when clearly my Grandma was not walking well and would need to go all the way to the front for their buffet. They moved us after we asked and then we sat on the patio, which is very nice as previous reviews have said. The food was mediocre. The best part was the bacon, which was exceptionally good for buffet bacon.   Having been here before for my Birthday a few years ago and remembering it fondly, I was very disappointed in this most recent experience. I may go back someday, but not sure if it will be for awhile...",

    "text": "Went for Sunday brunch at 11 am and had a very enjoyable meal. The attitude of the hostesses wasn't as inviting as I would have preferred, but everyone has their off days. They have indoor seating and outdoor, and though it was a perfect day for outdoor, we chose to sit in because there was more comfortable seating.  There were only two things keeping this from being a five-star dining experience. One was the appetizer we chose. Our initial decision came down to two choices: a 'crab and avocado tower' and 'salmon cheesecake.' We went with the tower, which didn't end up looking like a tower at all. It was certainly interesting, but it looked like a Chef Boyardee can had been filled with crab and avocado, then overturned. Once we dug in, it was a solid cylinder of 'meh.'  After a very underwhelming appetizer taste-wise (I knew we should've gotten the salmon cheesecake...) we ordered our dinner. I decided upon the chicken quesadilla. My mates balked at my decision to order a quesadilla when there were so many other options on the menu, but my reasoning was thus: if they are so fancy shmancy, then they'll take something simple like a quesadilla and knock it out of the park.  I was right on the money. I was able to taste the wild mushroom, chicken, and leeks crepe that neighbored my quesadilla, but it didn't compare. The quesadilla and accompanying guacamole was about as good as one could expect to get from a place that doesn't specialize in Mexican food.  If I weren't the type who tries to enjoy all the items on a restaurant's menu, I would definitely order the same thing on a return trip. I had a mimosa and a sangria to wash it down and both were delicious. It ended up being a delicious brunch to kick off what would be an excellent Sunday.  The other thing I didn't really like was our server. She was nice enough, but whenever I declined a suggestion she had made (cookies for desert, for instance) she said, \"okay, just checking on ya.\" She said this multiple times to the point that it became a running gag at our table. It's not really an issue, but it is pestering. This is not my first trip to the rodeo. I know how restaurants work and I understand what a waiter or waitresses' job is, thankyouverymuch.  I will probably return sometime soon. It was very good. Next time I'll sit outside (if it isn't too hot out) and try that salmon cheesecake. Just writing about it is making my mouth water.",

The Pesto Grilled Shrimp Salad, Chicken, Wild Mushroom and Leek Crepes and the Lump Crab Cake dish.  The crepe dish had too much sauce and the shrimp salad was served with only four small shrimp.  The crab cakes were good, definitely had better.  If you have been to Maryland, don't even try to compare the crab cakes.  Apples to oranges.  The food was fresh, flavor was good but not great.    The menu is definitely overpriced for the size of the dishes and quality of the food.",

One friend ordered a sandwich, which she enjoyed but the bread was overpowering.  We ended with the carrot cake. It was insanely dense and a little bit sweeter than my taste.  Overall, it was a good choice for a light lunch.   The decor was great, you felt as if you were dining in an updated farm house. The service was good, not great but they looked to be closing the place so they were busy outside.",

    "text": "My friend and I who do lunch dates are starting to try new places that neither has been to.  This was the first stop on our adventure.   When we arrived at this quaint and inviting establishment we were greeted with a smile and asked where we might like to sit.  The outdoor seating looked nice but since it was the middle of summer we went to one of the indoor areas.  We got the iced tea and the cheese plate to start.  It was a small cheese plate but it was perfect for 2 people to share.  The breads and cheeses were a great combination with the dried fruits and nuts.  I know that jams and honey are sometimes a part of the cheese plate picture but this was a small light taster to start.  The way we lunch is we both order an entree and then split it.  Today We order the Signature Strawberry Chicken Salad and the California Club, minus the avocado stupid allergies.  We informed the waitress that we would be splitting them so when they came out they were already split for us.  The first bite of the salad with that poppyseed dressing was so amazing that we both almost forgot about the rest of the food on our plates.  My salad was close to the potato salad so I accidentally got a taste and remember the rest of the food.  The potato salad is hardy and rich without being to mustardy.  It has bacon but it is not too overpowering and somehow still feels a little lite.  They had forgotten to take the avocado off so they immediately took it back and remade the sandwich.  I loved that you could tell that it was a new sandwich since some places take it back and try to scrape the avocado off when they forget.  They never get it all and so the benadryl comes out but I had no reaction.  The bread was this warm focaccia bread that I could have eaten all day.  The turkey was fresh, not slimy, with crisp bacon.  The meal ended up being too much for one sitting so we both had lunch for the next day.  We ended with the Red Velvet cake which came out looking so cute and tasting divine.  We have already talked about going back and refer people here quite frequently.  It is a little pricey but so worth it.",

Perhaps the best tasting bacon I've ever had. Yes it was that good! You know a place is 5 stars when they can get simple classic dishes to taste great. How great? I normally slather on some ketchup or sour cream on my potatoes and eggs but wouldn't have even thought about it here everything was so well done and flavorful.

I was offered a yummy sounding peach iced tea and was excited to order the caramelised onion cheese dip and sandwich. Unfortunately 25 minutes later I still did not have my tea and had yet to be able to order. I tried to flag down multiple waitresses with no luck. I was very hungry after not eating before my dress fitting and had seen our waitress wait on multiple other tables in our section. When we made the decision to leave to go eat somewhere else, the waitress offered to take our order. However, it was too little too late. We ended up lunching nearby and had a great time celebrating my wedding dress.

Your eyes and taste buds are tantalized by delicious-looking baked goods on display just inside the door.   There were some excellent choices on the wine list, including Klinker Brick Cab. Mmmm.   Many of the menu choices sounded good. Plenty of salads, sandwiches and other tasty sounding entrees. I had a tart of caramelized leeks, mushrooms and spinach. The pastry was flaky and the filling was fresh and flavorful. On the plate was an assorted greens salad with a very tasty lime vinaigrette.   It wasn't super-cheap, but not outrageous either. Lunch with two good glasses of wine, two entrees and a \"baby cake\" to celebrate my big day. The total tab came to around $60.

Today was the second instance where their hostess- Abby- was completely unprofessional an unkind :( we decided to take our in-laws there for lunch with our newborn, we arrived 1 full our before the close time they have posted in their website and their hostess - after making us wait an absurdly long time w/ a superfluous phone call (where she actually recommends other restaurants) - she said that had just made the decision to close earlier sending us out w/ a newborn on 109-degree weather. Rude and unprofessional. It's a shame that I won't be back because of their hostess!",

    "text": "Went here for a weekend lunch, made reservations the day before...reservations are probably a good idea as there are always people waiting outside it seems like. We sat in the back garden area...bring your sunglasses or you will melt. But the area in the back so pleasant, that it's one of the few times that I prefer outside to inside. There is a lot of shade in the back, so dont worry about the heat too much.   Make sure you bring your people watching sunglasses, because the people are important looking people...like VH1 housewives and grandmas who own Fortune 500 companies. It's a pretty posh crowd to say the least. But I enjoyed it. It's always nice to be in a civilized restaurant where service and food is great. I mean, i'm pretty sure you'll get served no matter what you wear, but it can't hurt to throw on a pair of khakis and a polo when you decide to come here.  I had the grilled vegetable chicken quesadilla....and it's the best quesadilla i've had. And the bread that comes out when you sit down is also amazing, I pretty much had two loaves before the entree came out. Our waitress had a British accent so obviously i had to ask her to repeat everything twice. But she was super nice and gave us really good service. Definitely a repeat location.",

    "text": "This place a joke.  It's pretty clear that they hired some fancy check to create their menu and then he has never touched the place since.   We came here because I saw the WARM goat cheese salad on the menu.  I'll get to that in a minute.   To start, my husband's water glass had gobbs of lipstick all over it.  Our server was actually quite friendly and she is the only thing about this place that deserves any stars.  I ordered the warm goat cheese raspberry salad, my friend ordered the caesar with dressing on the side, and my husband got the quesadilla.    The food came out surprisingly fast but it turns out that was because they forgot to cook it.  The WARM goat cheese was breaded but ice cold.  It had never even glanced at a heat source.  And my salad was completely missing chicken.  My friend's salad was slathered in dressing.  Fortunately my husband's food was at least decent although he wasn't raving about it.  We had to hunt down a random server because we couldn't find ours (she wasn't the person that brought our food) and it also took forever to get my drink refilled.  She sent our food back and yet again it came back with cold goat cheese.  The chicken was also cold and tough.  I had just completely given up at this point and just ate it, except the chicken which was tough and nasty.    We also noticed that the table next to us received bread which looked quite wonderful but we didn't get any and would have loved to have some.  I even made a comment about them not having bread.   We were completely disappointed and will never be back.",

They could be a little more generous with the protein, and most of the quacamole was turning brown (not exactly appetizing), but overall it was good. The salsa that it came with was the redeemed the old guacamole.  However, the person who served the guacamole could have been a little more sensible and not served brown guac. Instead, it looked like it was mixed in with the nice looking guacamole as if I wouldn't notice.",

On both occasions, we were disappointed with the service. On our first visit, I had to ask our server twice for more hot water for my tea, and never got it until another server got it for me.  The second time, we waited 20 minutes for our food, my husband's coffee cup sat empty several times after he was asked if he wanted more coffee, said \"yes please,\" then it didn't come until he asked again.  My sense was they didn't have enough help for the size of the place and the number of customers.",

    "text": "Outstanding farm-to-table seasonal food served in what looks and feels like a French cottage near the gallery district of Scottsdale.  There is ample outdoor seating when the weather is nice (as it is most of the time there) and a charming inside dining area.  While the food is well crafted and delicious, this does not seem to be the kind of place that gets many male patrons.  I could count on one hand how many men were dining here when I went for lunch.  To compound the matter, I had just finished a difficult and sweaty hike up Camelback Mountain prior to coming here.  My shabby appearance earned me loads of disdain from the hostess.  But, as my friend duly noted, \"our money is still good.\"  Indeed.  I started with the soup, a split pea and ham served with a cheesy breadstick, was an excellent rendition of this classic.  It had a smokiness that only a good hamhock can lend.  My entree choice was the herb roasted chicken sandwich, which was a delicious combination of slow-roasted chicken, oven-cured tomatoes, roasted artichokes, baby spinach and herb goat cheese spread on a warm baguette served with a bacon-spiked potato salad.  As good as this was, by friend's meal was even better.  She ordered the chicken, wild mushroom, goat cheese and leek crepes with a basil cream sauce.  I took a bite and it was literally a flavor explosion.  I almost regretted my menu choice after tasting her's.  Arcadia Farms Cafe also specializes in baked goods, including various pastries, cakes, muffins and cookies.  We grabbed a few cookies (chocolate toffee and an iced lemon) to go.    I would definitely return, particularly to try breakfast (which is supposed to be quite good).  Next time, though, I will be sure to not engage in strenuous exercise right before.",

    "text": "Alex A. and I wanted to try one of the fancy restaurants in Scottsdale and I picked Arcadia Farms because it seemed like the perfect place for a quaint little Sunday lunch. The fact that it was raining didn't detract from the cuteness of this place. It's nestled away from the hustle and bustle of Scottsdale Rd. but still close enough to walk to the Artwalk and have an overall enjoyable afternoon. The restaurant is very cottage-like, with small separate rooms. The space felt a little bit tight at times, especially at the entrance. But it has that very homey sort of feel.   First thing I noticed was that the crowd here was generally older. It seemed like a big gathering of knitting circles or book clubs. But the food was by no means out-dated. It wasn't trendy nor very traditional - just very normal.   Our service wasn't amazing, but it was okay. Our food came very quickly, which was a nice surprise. I really enjoyed the garlic bread that they served at the beginning, and I'm not even a fan of garlic bread. Our first batch was cold, though.  We ordered the Arcadia Greek Salad and the California Club Sandwich with the split pea soup. It was nice and well-proportioned, but again, I didn't think it was blow-my-mind amazing. The hummus that came with the Greek Salad was pretty exceptional, and I gobbled that right up. But everything else was...meh.  I'd come for the dining atmosphere. Too bad it was raining today, but I imagine that outside garden/patio area would be very nice to dine in. I didn't care that much about the food, though. The prices were normal (about $12 to $16/plate), and the presentation was very appetizing, but nothing we ordered was very great. Maybe we didn't order the right things, but I don't think I'd be coming back to try other stuff very soon.",

I had asked the waitress what kind of pastries they had (the menu said to ask because it changes), and she said \"I don't know, you should have looked when you came in\". Unbeknownst to me, because I am not from this area, should have figured out the pastry is in the front foyer, uncovered, and collecting all kinds of dust and germs from the customers walking past it. The muffins were labeled \"blueberry lemon\" but they were actually cranberry. Thankfully, I am not allergic to cranberries. I am allergic to a curt waitress who, when asked for a take home container, gives me two small boxes and said \"don't have bigger ones\". Well, leftover salad spilled all over the table because containers were way too small. Asked her for a bag because now the salad was falling out of these small containers. It was a mess. She saw the mess and did not blink an eye. Tables are also too close together. I heard entire conversations, whether I wanted to hear them or not. Also, lots of bird poop on tables outside because they are not covered. Great way to catch some funky bird flu, GROSS.....",

I ordered crab avocado stack and a side of potatoes. No problems, nice to know it's focused on local food where possible (...though not the crab). I could see that I might have ordered poorly and their baked goods look stellar, so I'm giving four stars because the location is awesome and their store next door, the Marketplace, is very cool.   And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that my wife and I were treated exceptionally well the previous day at the Marketplace. My wife had a dietary constraint so the kitchen made us a special salad right as they were closing just to be 100% sure that there wasn't anything potentially problematic dietarily in my wife's salad. And I got a great latte.  All in all I'd give Arcadia Farms another try to be sure and would have no problem heading back to the Marketplace as well.",

The atmosphere was very girls do lunch.  And it was a beautiful day, so if you can get a table outside grab it, or make reservations.  I am not an avocado lover, so I could have done without the crab tower, but my kids love it. The mushroom spinach tart was delicious as was the grilled salmon and Turkey Brie sandwich.  But the highlight was the Tuxedo Baby cake and the lemon cookie.  Both melt in your mouth.  Was a tad disappointed in the baby carrot cake  but  I'd come here again if in the area.",

    "text": "Arcadia Farms Cafe is a pretty little restaurant in a great location but a few things prevent me from giving it three or four stars.  Firstly, the fact that it's a breakfast/lunch place that stops serving all breakfast / brunch items at 12pm on weekends (11am during the week) is pretty much a cardinal sin in my book. This is the only restaurant I know of, that's open until 3pm that does this.   Butters, Eggstasy, Scramble, Butterfields, Daily Dose, Morning Squeeze, etc. all have a similar niche, similar hours and serve all breakfast/brunch food items on the menu until they close at 2:30 or 3pm. I was really, really disappointed to come to Arcadia Farms Cafe at 1pm on a Sunday for brunch only to be told they quit serving it an hour earlier.   And sadly, they seem to have far more breakfast/brunch items on the menu than they do lunch items, which is confounding. Why have all of your most alluring menu items available for a 3-4 hour time span? Especially on the weekends!  Secondly, I wasn't thrilled with my entree- which was the vegetable quesadilla. The cheese was sort of gloppy and the vegetables were cut too large to actually stay in the quesadilla. With every bite of the quesadilla, random vegetables kept tumbling out. I wasn't impressed.  My friend and I did split the goat cheese dip and it was actually very, very good. I usually despise goat cheese, but I think they may have mixed it with something else to create this dip, because it was creamy and not as funky tasting as I generally find goat cheese to be.  I also very much enjoyed the white sangria.  If I were to give Arcadia Farms another chance it would be during their (painfully limited) breakfast/brunch window. The lunch menu wasn't impressive or varied enough for me to return for that meal again.",

The atmosphere is incredible, calming, and everything you hope for in brunch.  The food so awesome!

It was a cool Phoenix day when we visited but the time we were there was one of the few times that day where the sun peeked from behind the clouds and offered some warmth.  Still, we opted to sit inside although they have a cute patio out front.  My husband had the Chicken Cobb Salad which was huge.  He opted for dressing on the side and they are generous with it.  I had the Warm Smoked Turkey, Melted Brie and Apple Sandwich.  The warm sandwich was great for the chilly day and it came with a fig jam that was delicious.  It was a huge sandwich and I was not able to finish it.  The service was fast and friendly.  Even though we were still there past closing, so were quite a few others and the staff was not rushing anyone out.  This place is off of the main street but do not miss it.  It's a great find and we will return.",

The side plates had a layer of black dust on them, so I didn't use it as a sharing plate. We both ordered omelets which were pretty good but nothing too special. The house made salsa was yummy though and added flavor to the fairly simple veggie omelet I had. The breakfast potatoes are better than homefries served at breakfast joints.",

Then the selection of great brunch entrees are delicious and a decent serving size. But I must recommend the brunch board. It has a variety of cheeses, jams, breads, and meats that are truly a unique combination! I'll definitely be coming back!",

The owners took what appear to be one of the old houses in downtown Scottsdale and converted it into a beautiful and classy small dining room/tea room-esque restaurant. I did not get much time to explore other than walking in the front to our table in the back, a bit nestled away from everyone else dining there already. Since we had a reservation, I didn't have to wait for a table. Our service was simply amazing. If our waiter wasn't by helping us, then one of the owners (I assume) was checking in on us.   Their menu is simple and chock full of deliciousness. I like that they have fresh mini sweet biscuits to greet you upon seating. It's definitely a place I'd like to return for another small group outing!",

    "text": "My mother thought it would be great to join Arcadia Farms this year for Easter brunch and was very excited to experience it. Unfortunately from the beginning we had already run into issues. I'm not sure how long they've been doing Easter brunch, but I sure hope my review will help with any future events such as this.   My mother made reservations over the phone with a host a week prior to Easter. She is not app savvy and made a simple phone call to the restaurant to set up the reservation. She had a feeling the initial call for the reservation wasn't enough since the host did not give her a proper reservation or email confirmation, she just said show up, we got you down. My mom calls two days before to confirm, since we're a party of 8, and the host on the phone tells my mom she doesn't see any reservation for her. Again, the host promises that we're down for our reservation, changes the time, and all is good to go. We get there on the morning of and the host in person tells us that there was some \"glitch\" on the app they used for reservations and that another party cancelled but somehow it cancelled out our reservation as well. Okay, fine we understood, waited 30 mins till they put together our table.  Once seated we were promised to get a pastry basket for the table and individual fruit cups per person. They did not offer that till we were practically out the door and were only able to provide the basket of pastries 10 mins before we left. Never got the fruit cups.  There were drinks and items written on the menu, besides the bottomless mimosas, that were not available such as bloody mary's and other alcoholic beverages. Why would you put them there if we cannot order it? No hot tea was available either.  As a brunch buffet, it was VERY disorganized. They were constantly out of cups, utensils, plates for the food, bagels, coffee, and drinks. The chef making the omelettes at the station did not have enough plates to put the omelettes on! It was said later that the main kitchen was not in this particular part of the restaurant, but that's not an excuse. Again, it all comes down to being professional and quick, and being organized to run this type of event or buffet.   I will say, the host and some of the servers were trying to keep up with the demand of not just our table, but all the other tables waiting on the same questions and service that was required but never met properly. The host even went across the street to get my mom a hot tea since he was trying to make up for the inconvenience, very nice of him. For the price that people pay to get a buffet experience, they did not meet the basic requirements such as food/drinks/cutlery/plates.  No effort was made to compensate us for our wait or the disappointment of not being able to share a meal or a drink with family at the same time since everyone had to either keep waiting or getting up as soon as the food or plates or drinks were arriving.  Only positive feedback I have is that the location and scenery was beautiful and themed to the Easter vibe. And the food and pastries were well prepared and tasty. There is so much potential here, if it was not so disorganized and so lacking in service in the buffet portion I would have given 4 or 5 stars.",

They tell you walk ins are ok but you might have to wait.  No problem.  Walk over only to be told that sorry were not taking orders now because we're transitioning from breakfast to lunch and the kitchen needs a half hour for the switch over.  Now that would have been useful information when we called,  but \"we didn't know when you'd arrive so we didn't tell you.\" What? Nothing on their website says anything about this. We were able to sit and order drinks but no food.  Ok,  so that's better,  but 10 minutes after sitting down the waitstaff takes the breakfast order of the table next to us while we're told we need to wait another half hour.    For mediocre food,  it is not worth the annoyance of going out of your way for the Old Town setting.",

Sometimes the servers are hard to pin down, but on my last visit, Pam was amazing. When my sister mentioned that we were celebrating our mother's birthday, Pam brought out an adorable mini cake with a candle. (We really appreciated that!)  I was a little disappointed with my Fresh Berry Crepes. For the price they charged ($13) I didn't expect to have canned? frozen? blueberries on them. (They did include fresh strawberries though.) However, I wanted to keep five stars on my review because I think their Strawberry Chicken Salad and Herb Roasted Chicken are delicious.   If you're meeting friends for lunch, this is a great choice. They also seem to celebrate a lot of baby and bridal showers. Overall- it's a solid choice for breakfast or lunch.",

I wish I would have had my eggs sunny side up instead of scrambled but wasn't given the option. Also, the pork was a little dry. All in all, it was still good though.   The service was good too!!

The fruit and bread basket would have been nice had they arrived with the champagne and not mid-meal after we had to remind them to bring them. Food is OK.  Nothing special.  Bottom line, if you over cook eggs Benedict and the greens on the side are wilted, what more is there to say? The atmosphere is lovely but not in the summer as it is uncomfortably swamp cooler cool at best.  And there are way too many tables crammed in to each of the rooms making it very noisy and crowded.  OK if you are in NY, not OK in old-town Scottsdale. I wanted to love it and will go back, perhaps. Have to say, for the same $$, I recommend El Chorro",

We had my birthday brunch here and they were extremely accommodating when we wanted to be seated in the sun which turned out to be lovely since it was such a beautiful day.  The breakfast food was delicious.  They give out little scones before your food comes out which was a life saver for us because we were all starving!    I had the Egg Strada Cobbler which I didn't realize had chunks of bread in it but it definitely was NOT a deal breaker because it was so yummy, with chunks of tasty sausage and zucchini that was perfectly cooked along with melted cheese on top that sealed the deal (crispy cheesy bread along the side? yes please!).  Definitely a winner!  My friend had the Fresh Berry Crepe which was perfectly balanced and not too sweet.  Another had the Quesadilla which did not disappoint.  The only possible negatives were that my Kir Royal (raspberry with sparkling wine) was not as tasty as I would have liked, and we had a couple of people who don't eat pork and in certain dishes, such as the Egg Strada, they could not swap out the pork for chicken sausage because they were already mixed (the quesadilla was swap friendly just fyi).  Overall, I really loved the place with the great food, service and ambiance.  I would definitely recommend!",

We don't know a Gloria. The service was horrible. Our waitress was not friendly and looked stressed out.  A smile goes a long way. It took forever to get our food ordered. We got nothing pleasant from our waitress and was reluctant to take our group photo for our book club. Really? Lighten up.  We weren't giving her a hard time or anything.  She did take the photo and did a good job. At the end again, disappointment. Stressed out waitress, informed us to put away your birthday cupcakes you can't have them here. She was nice enough to ask the manager was it ok. We said never mind we will eat them outside. Yes, in 105 degrees. We were offered a birthday dessert for our book club friend. She declined; we were ready to go after that. it was not a good experience; it also ruined our book club experience.  I am sure that the waitress was having a tough day and I am sure things weren't all her fault, but sometimes you just have to roll with it and she did that poorly.  I will not be returning.",

    "text": "Mmmm... best Birthday Brunch ever!  Arcadia Farms is adorable.  Sitting on the front patio for Sunday Brunch I felt like I should be wearing some sort of hat and perhaps a floral dress.  No need - mimosas can be just as easily consumed in jeans!  Our server was fantastic - once determining that all four of us were having mimosas, she recommended getting a bottle of champagne & carafe of OJ as opposed to separate drinks - less expensive and more bubbly!  So, right off the bat I knew I liked her.  My esteem only grew when halfway through our meal the hostess accidentally removed our champagne bucket from the nearby empty table where we were keeping it.  Our server (gosh I wish I could remember her name!) chased it down and brought it back like a hero!    OK, on to the food.  Shortly after we ordered, our rockstar server brought us a plate of complimentary strawberry scones, since she thought our food might be delayed since a party of 14 had just ordered.  Delicious!  It did not seem to me like our meals took a long time to arrive, either.  My friends enjoyed their entrees (French toast, black bean omlette and egg strada cobbler).  I loved mine too - I had the Crepes \"Croque-Monsieur\" (no, I can't pronounce that).  Crepes filled with ham & gruyere cheese and topped with bechamel sauce.  I prefer savory vs. sweet and these were spot on.  We finished our \"ladies who brunch\" experience with dessert - cute little cakes filled with rasberry and chocolate mousse.    After all of that wonderful food, the rest of the day was kind of a blur...  Love, love, love Arcadia Farms and can't wait to go back.  This will be my new \"go to\" spot for out of town guests!",

    "text": "Arcadia Farms is AWESOME. A friend of mine that lives in Scottsdale recommended it to me as a great brunch spot. My mom, brother and I went for brunch on a Saturday and were seated outside right away. We got there 10 minutes before they switched to lunch service, but let us order off of either the breakfast or lunch menus. The red Sangria was great and was served in a pitcher with big wine glasses full of ice and fruit, to serve ourselves.  Our waiter was so attentive, and cute to boot! I think his name was John, and he looked like a combo of Johnny Depp/Colin Ferrell. We needed to get a last minute birthday cake for my grandmother's 70th, and asked John if he had a bakery recommendation. Coincidentally, they have a bakery right across the street and had made one extra tuxedo cake! John put the cake on our bill and brought it right over when we finished our meal.   We ordered the berry crepe and the breakfast quesadilla. Both were amazing. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and the cookies and cake across the street.",

First off service is extremely slow & that us defiantly this places major down fall .I went here with a girlfriend and her brand new baby and my 2 yr old daughter it took them 2.5 hrs to get us out of there ? Thank god our children were well behaved, it took about 10-15 min after ring seated for someone to come around and ask for our drink order. Then when we wanted to place order I wanted the turkey & Brie sandwich minus the Brie our waiter informed me that food is pre made  & I couldn't get that ? For $14.00 sandwhich I would expect a fresh one made at least so I changed my order to the chicken quesadilla it was very tasty :) we waited around for our check for about an hr or so we were just chit chatting so didn't realize it had been that long but to add insult to injury my girlfriend paid cash & for her meal & never had her change brought out the server we finally flagged down and said could you bring our change and she was like of you want change ? Uh yeah I want my change so that pissed my friend off big time we were getting up to leave & the server was hovering around to get her tip very annoying because whenever we needed to be served she was no where to be found ?  The restaurant itself very cute & charming & could have a ton of potential but I would rather go elsewhere for the price & service. Overall food was just ok nothing special. I did check out the little market across street to get daughter a cookie very friendly staff & cookie was delicious :)",

Can recommend the following:  Warm Sonoma Goat Cheese Salad with fresh Raspberries - organically grown baby lettuce , goat cheese medallions, jicama, carrots, fresh raspberries and candied pecans with their home made raspberry vinaigrette....the pecans are truly delicious!  Short Rib Quesadilla - A special of the day.....very delicious.  Home made lemonade - very refreshing  On the way out the smell of coffee and the view of the double chocolate cookies was too much so ordered to go......very, very good coffee and the cookie tasted like a chocolate brownie.....very moist and absolutely mouth watering......  There are many choices for seating....front patio, side patio, back patio and of course inside...all seating options have a great cozy feel....doubt you could pick a bad spot.  Staff are also awesome.",

We walked through the cute little cafe and then into a building off the back patio for a private lunch. Our server was fantastic -- super fun and personable. Between the 8 of us we ordered peach Bellini's, mimosa, and sangria with red. I couldn't really make out the peach flavor in my Bellini, but I've also never had one before so I'm not air what the standard is. The sangria was good (and quite large).  We ordered and the food arrived promptly. I got the shrimp pesto salad and honestly wish I could eat it everyday! The shrimp was done perfectly, not at all rubbery and perfectly glazed with the pesto sauce. I should have asked what the dressing was because it complemented the person and goat cheese very well. I enjoyed the fresh corn that was on the salad, could have had a bit more. I'm not a huge tomato fan-but if you are they are plentiful on this salad. Another dish I remember others getting and loving was the Mediterranean sandwich and the turkey and Brie sandwich (with fig jam and apples).  We had a lovely time here-it's a great place to chat and enjoy yummy food!",

You're outside but feels protected like the inside. It's a nice balance. There are some small birds that fly and hop around but they are enjoyable.  It was an April morning so the weather wasn't too hot and still permitted patio seating.   Service seems a little slow but worth it for the top notch meals and it is a comfortable environment to relax and wait. We had the Pulled Pork and requested it with the eggs over-medium rather than scrambled. They did a great job!  We also ordered the Berry Crepes which was more like dessert since it was so sweet, but definitely delicious. The complimentary scones were a delight at the beginning of the meal. The Darjeeling tea and Mimosas were a delight. Have been here before and will be back. We live nearby and have lots of choices. This is one of our favs!",

As an appetizer I ordered the wild mushroom and chive omelet with goat cheese ($12). By the time I finished, lunch serviced started. Everything on the menu looked delicious, making the decision tough. I went with the Grilled Chicken and Vegetable Quesadilla ($13) and Turkey & Brie Sandwich with Arcadia potato salad ($14). All of the dishes were flavorful while not being overly rich. I also appreciate that their menu identified which items were vegan, vegetarian, diary free and/or gluten free. I will definitely be back to try their crepes and salads.   What I recommend: -- Wild mushroom and chive omelet with goat cheese -- Turkey & brie sandwich -- Grilled chicken and vegetable quesadilla -- Arcadia potato salad or field greens as the side",

    "text": "Delicious lunch food, great patio, with only a couple hang-ups. I ventured here on Sunday for brunch with my mom and Erin S. Good thing we made reservations because the place was bumpin. We were seated on the expansive back patio filled with many tables. There was a wedding luncheon in action as well as what looked like a bridal shower. The private dining area in the back appeared very well suited for such affairs.  I ordered the salmon salad, which came on a bed of all kinds of leafy goodness. The dressing was very tasty and the salmon was cooked so tender and flaky that a spoon could cut right through. Erin ordered the popular Strawberry Chicken Salad, with mixed baby greens, toasted almonds and poppyseed vinaigrette. All the ingredients were fresh, and often gluten free with vegan options. For dessert we had the Seasonal Fresh Fruit Crisp, which was ok - think \"apple crisp.\" Now, the Tuxedo Cake was exquisite. The breading was moist and meshed with the adjoining caramel and frosting. I highly recommend it.  The only downsides were that we never received our appetizer, and our waitress disappeared after we acquired our entrees. We hoped to order dessert and were curious about our missing plate. After hailing down another waiter, we realized that ours was occupied by the large wedding party. No big deal, we were enjoying our experience, but it would have been nice to get a heads-up!  Final remarks: Make reservations. The food is fresh and flavorful; the dessert being an obvious highlight. Expect a bit of a wait on a Sunday afternoon.",

We don't live anywhere near this restaurant but made the 50 min drive JUST for the desserts. They run out quick so you have to make a point to come early. Now, I'd like to say that I'm not the hugest coconut fanatic like my husband but this cake just balances it just the right way so that ALL your taste buds have the most epic party you never want to leave. I ate a cake there AND THEN asked for one to go. The almond croissant I took home, it sat in the fridge for two days, I took it out, microwaved it for 5 seconds and put it in the toaster oven, it was heavenly. Soft and flakey on the inside and crunchy on the outside. I could only imagine the level of deliciousness it would have been fresh. We came again Sunday and they had already sold out, to say I was sad and disappointed is an understatement. I'LL BE BACK FOR YOU ALMOND CROISSANT!!",

The table we wanted (which I think remained empty during our entire visit) was unavailable. Hmm...  Our server was friendly, helpful and not in a rush. She took our orders and left. Moments later, another waitress shows up - telling us she'll be our server now because our former gal had to wait on her sister. Okay ... odd.   We had put in my daughter's order first as she was starving. It arrived minus the scrambled eggs, which the new waitress (Polly, I think her name was) told me we hadn't ordered. Oh yes, dear - but you wouldn't know because it was with your predecessor.   10 minutes later the one scrambled egg shows up. When I mention how long it took, Polly once again started arguing and left visibly offended.   Probably 25 minutes after placing our order, our food arrived. Polly served it without a word. Seriously - not a sound, not a nod, not a smile. I went to the hostess and asked for a different waitress - one without an attitude.  Our 3rd and final server was nice, friendly but the food disappointed. My wife's French toast arrived cold. When we asked if that was intended, our server promptly put in a new order ... which arrived lukewarm, a smaller portion, and on a cold plate.   It would have been a 0 stars experience had it not been for our 3rd server's friendliness and the unexpected birthday cake she brought. But we will not be returning.",

    "text": "I ate here today and seven years ago. Here is a recap of both.  Seven years ago my friend had a bridal shower lunch here. We sat in the back of the restaurant. Food was unremarkable, service was decent except I specifically remember the waitress disappeared for long periods of time. The atmosphere was beautiful.  Today, the food was still unremarkable. What do I mean by that? I mean I ordered the salmon sandwich with fruit. It came missing the onion and arugula the menu said it came with. The mayo or aioli that comes \"on\" it was slopped on the side of the sandwich. (I don't care if it's a $3 sandwich or a $19 sandwich, I like when people take pride in their product and put the condiments where they belong) No fruit, and a side salad instead. I told the waitress right away that I would be OK with the salad, but I would need some dressing. Yes, the salad came completely dry.   My grandmother asked for an extra side of poppyseed dressing for her salad, and the rest of us were finished with our meal by the time the extra dressing arrived. One time she tried to ask the waitress about it, but she didn't hear I guess because she just kept walking. We sat on the patio, again the atmosphere was beautiful! The patio was not very busy. Seven tables, we were one of three tables, a fourth had been sat by the end of our meal.  After lunch, I went to use the restroom to wash my hands before checking out the Marketplace next door. The bathroom needed serious attention. Empty toilet paper rolls, a GIANT turd floating in the toilet, awful odor, and the sink was very dirty.   I might associate the stench and unremarkable food with the restaurant from now on. :-(  I did the right thing, and let the hostess know so that someone could clean up the bathroom.   Nextdoor is the Marketplace, and I purchased a baby carrotcake to take home to my husband.",

The server we had this time was great and one of the best we have had but in watching and listening to other servers, management still hasn't addressed this with their workers.  We keep coming back because the food is excellent however, we definitely don't go as often as we used to and I did notice they were quite empty for a Sunday.  They just need to tell their employees to be nice and they would get 5stars.",

    "text": "Very cute brunch spot in Old Town Scottsdale!!  We originally planned on eating somewhere else but the wait time was an hour, so my friend recommended this cafe and I'm so glad we ended up here! We didn't have reservations, but luckily outdoor seating was available. It was properly shaded and they had misters, so the heat wasn't too bad.  First glance at the Saturday brunch menu - it seemed a bit more pricy than most spots, but each item came with strawberry scones and the portions ended up being huge! Their brunch menu has a mix of both savory and sweet dishes. We shared a brunch board between (3) people and we were already full before we received our main course. Everything we ordered was AMAZING-- food quality, presentation, taste, and portion sizes. Service was great as well!  I had a pleasure dining in, can't wait to come back!!  TIPS: - Make a reservation ahead of time, especially if you are in a big group! - Look at the menu online before you go! They have different menus for different days, i.e. Saturday brunch, Sunday brunch, weekday breakfast and lunch, etc. so keep that in mind if you're wanting to try something specific. They also don't allow substitutions",

    "text": "My first time here and I don't think I can justify going back. Our family of 4 had Sunday brunch. I guess I should have known it would be pricey given the location in old town Scottsdale. That would have been okay if I felt the food warranted the high sticker price.   My turkey panini with apple, brie, fig and walnut bread was a big disappointment. I would have expected freshly carved turkey for $22, but instead it was sliced deli meat. Boar's Head would have been better. The side salad had little dressing on it and did not compensate for the sub par sandwich. The only thing I enjoyed was the pastry basket.  Also Vegas N.'s review reminded me that none of us received a side of fruit as indicated on the menu.  Everyone else had a dish that was better than mine, but again I cannot justify the cost and would prefer to go elsewhere.",

    "text": "We have been to Arcadia Farms a few times before and always liked it. My wife posted a 4* review before.   A couple of Sundays ago we went for breakfast and came away very disappointed. Instead of the normal breakfast menu, they now have a brunch menu. Their menu reads \"each brunch entree includes fresh fruit, assorted mini pastries, and one complimentary glass of champagne.\"  Using the phrase \"complimentary glass of champagne\" Is deceptive as the exact same entree on Saturday cost 5 to 6 dollars less but does not include fruit or champagne and substitute petite strawberry scones instead of mini pastries.  The Santa Fe omelet was overcooked and had minimal amounts of the ingredients listed on the menu. The peach French toast sounded promising but had just a scant amount of pecan caramel sauce on it.  We will stick to visiting them just for lunch.",

    "text": "I can see the appeal of this place for people that like the farmhouse, quaint, wholesome vibe.  From the moment we walked in, we felt the more formal vibe and the hostess was pretty strict. There were a bunch of open tables but they said there was a 20-minute wait. We asked if we could sit outside but she asked the owner and they said they do not allow folks to dine outside after 11am (it is August and pretty hot but we are used to the heat). So, we spent our 20-minute wait in the marketplace next door looking at their pastries and small trinkets for sale.   The hostess came and found us in the marketplace and showed us to our table. Several tables were open so they must have had a bunch of tables leave at the same time, or else I am guessing we wouldn't have had to wait.    All brunches come served with a basket of pastries and champagne. Maybe this is partially why the prices of the brunch dishes are so high? The basket of pastries came delivered after our meal was brought to the table. I really enjoyed my berry crepe. My husband did not care for his crab benedict. He said it tastes fishy and the avocado paste wasn't super appealing. He ended up leaving half of it because his stomach started hurting.   This seems like a nice place for people that want a more formal brunch experience. But it wasn't our scene or vibe - and for the cost, we would prefer to go somewhere that we feel more comfortable and welcomed.",

Ordered the special, crab-cake Benedict, came out fresh and hot. Only complaint is crab meat is dry in general and they could of had much more avo sauce to combat the dryness.  Poached eggs where a tad bit over cooked.  The wifey ordered omelette and it was quite tasty. Service was fabulous. Overall is was good. Maybe my expectations where too high because of all the hype I hear about this place. However, there are a few items want to try on the menu that are unique  so I will be back and who knows maybe I will place an update on this review.",

From the service to the ambiance to the food, everything was absolutely top notch.  I ordered the breakfast quesadilla but I am pretty sure anything on the menu would have been incredible. I was having major food envy of the baked french toast my Uncle was enjoying! With fruit and syrup and all the goodies loaded on - very Instagram-worthy and delicious. My breakfast quesadilla was loaded up with egg, chorizo, and veggie, and was incredibly filling.  I was headed to the airport after this and was grateful for the delicious, local, fresh brewed coffee. It was the best way to end a long week and totally revived my still-jet-lagged brain. The atmosphere is simply adorable and there are misters everywhere, making for a comfortable outdoor dining experience - even in Scottsdale in June. I can't wait to go back on my next visit!",

And it is gluten free (I didn't eat everything gluten free on this meal but it is nice that they have options!). My friend had the black bean omelet. It had avocado, roasted peppers, goat cheese served with homemade salsa. I tasted the salsa and it was really good! Oh her meal was gluten free too!

First look at Sunday's brunch menu I thought $22 for a crepe was outrageous, but when I read that all entrees come with a glass of champagne, assorted pastries, and fruit, this ends up being pretty compatible what would have been spent on all of those items individually.  The assorted pastries did not disappoint, I had to contain myself from the mini strawberry scones and crumb cake to save room for my ham and thyme quiche which was equally as tasty.  Definitely a sport to come with an appetite!  Service was friendly and loved how the atmosphere and decode transported me right out of Arizona.",

For my entree, I ordered the crab and avocado tower. It's a really good size portion and it was delicious. I definitely want to come back for brunch again!",

You have to get there before 9 AM to get their croissants I'm told. I had one today any I can see why. The mushroom leek tart, simply amazing.  There is a lot going on with this place and all of it is worthwhile.   Actual customer comment overheard: \"It's a good thing we don't live closer.

Complementary champagne on Sunday brunch upon arrival, as well as fresh pastries and fruit when you're seated at your table! The space is so pretty, partially outdoors and reminiscent of a French tea house. You almost forget you're in the desert!   The service was very attentive, and friendly. Our server was super sweet! We ordered the mushroom omelette ham and gruyere crepe. Both were delicious, but the cheese inside of filling inside of the crepe was cold. I'm not sure if this is how its traditionally served or if it didn't cook throughout. Either way, it was still good!   Overall a wonderful experience, I'm glad we decided to try this place for our anniversary. Definitely returning when we have guests in town visiting!",

You now get to pay brunch prices ($20+ a plate), but you really don't get anything extra for it other than the glass of wine or sparkling wine (not sure which since I don't drink). The quality of food and pastry is still good, and the service is still good, but the limited options and the overpriced brunch makes it hard to justify. I hope they reconsider this brunch only menu.",

    "text": "Bad experience. We had some friends from out of town visiting us and we took them to Arcadia Farms for brunch last saturday. We got there at around 10:30ish and we had 2 babies (18 months). The seating staff seemed annoyed that they had to accommodate our babies. It was a very cold and chilly morning and they offered us outside seating at this one table under a tree in the shade with a cold wind tunnel. We explained one of the babies was a bit sick but they didn't seem to care and said they don't have many tables inside and can only seat us inside at the condition of having the babies in our lap! They said they ran out of high chairs and i swear to God, i only saw 1 other child inside this place! We kindly explained it will be very hard to contain the babies in our arms and try to eat and asked if we could at least take our strollers and keep the babies in(and we had umbrella strollers not the big bulky kind!)) and they refused! basically they gave us no real option. We could either sit outside and freeze(there were 3 other tables out in the sun and they refused to give them to us and they offered one of them to a party that came after us btw) or we could sit inside and hold the babies in our laps while eating.  So we basically pleaded and the hostess was so frazzled as if we had asked her to wake a sleeping ogre or something! We finally decided to take a chance and asked to sit inside without any high chairs and as soon as we walked to our table we noticed there were 10-12 empty tables! They gave us such a hard time when more than half the place was empty! How truly disgusting. We were so upset.  To top it all, when it was time to order it was abt 11:05 and our server said we could not order any breakfast items, only lunch and she couldn't do anything abt it. And she went on to mention they didn't really have any food for the kids. I asked her to make a cheese quesadilla and they brought out the hardest tortilla(as if they soaked it in oil and fried it or something). The kids couldn't even eat it.   The food was very sub par, extremely disappointing! Our friends were appalled at how uncourteous and somehow partial the staff had been towards us. Very very disappointing experience. Will not go back and will def not recommend to anyone!",

The service was decent, but when it came time to get the check our waiter was nowhere to be found for over 30 minutes (we had to ask another waitress to find him).

My bacon serving was 2 slices and it was smokey, sweet, meaty, salty, crispy and delish! The potatoes were quite uneven in size and therefore very uneven in how they were cooked.

My girlfriend didn't finish her salad and was going to take it home.  When our server finally showed up to the table next to us, I asked for our check as we were running late (by now it was 11:55) Apparently when I was looking down to get my credit card, someone took both plates without asking if we wanted a box to go.  It was clear the plate was 3/4 full of salad and any server would ask if we wanted it to go.   When I asked our server what happened to our plates she was clueless!  Even though the food is good, the service should equally be as good.  Not sure I will return.",

I can walk here when I'm down to visit my family, so that's a plus.  Fantastic breakfast, brunch, and lunch here, some of the best I've had.  They have a fantastic patio, very private, and even intimate.  Good wine list, lots of menu options, and awesome service.    Just recently we were there and there was some construction next door.  They were cutting concrete, so you can imagine the noise on the patio.  The manager went over, got the construction foreman and gave him a piece of her mind.  Talk about sticking up for your patio customers.  They halted and we were able to enjoy our brunch.  I'll always recommend this spot to anybody living or traveling to Scottsdale.  Wine lunch?

To all who live in the Valley, you know how exciting it is when the weather takes a turn for the better and the thought of eating a meal on a lovely patio makes you jump out of your chair. This place has that whimsical patio that you could sit on and drink mimosas for hours. The service was very good and the food was delicious. My sister and I both had the wild mushroom tart which was savory, satisfying and oh-so-good. The only reason I am not giving Arcadia five stars is because I have to be a bit of a vegetarian snob. There weren't that many veggie options (at least for brunch), I think only two or three menu items.   I look forward to to returning here to check out their breakfast and will definitely be a repeat customer.",

    "text": "Mothers Day brunch. Street parking no problem. Got seated right away. But then the wait, and wait. Finally someone arrived at the table and took drinks orders, did say ready to order, but somehow didnt register as waitress disappeared. Finally different waitress arrived for food order. And then after 25mins we got our drinks (water and lemonade). I should have asked questions (several) when making reservation. I thought we had been before on Mother's Day, but presented with a fixed menu (asked for the regular menu, was not an option). Not a dessert person, just wanted the meal, but okay. Ordered salmon (very disappointing, not fresh by any stretch of the imagination).   The bill arrived with a 20% gratuity added in, there were just 3 of us. I was very upset. I should have said something, and normally would. but did not want to upset my dear wife. I am still steaming over that 20% gratuity,  for poor service and mediocre food.   We have been to Arcadia Farms on several occasions, and was always a pleasant experience.  Has there been a change of ownership or management recently, this was not fun. Felt had been royally fleeced",

    "text": "From a well-traveled perspective, regarding the food, service and ambiance, I was truly disappointed on every level.  This was my third time, the last being on Mother's Day.  The food was fair and the service was unacceptable!  I went there on a Saturday, no reservation, so a wait was expected, and we were told 20 to 25 minutes.  Fifty minutes later we were seated.  Fifteen minutes later after being seated and asking twice about a server, a manager came over took our drink order and an appetizer order.  Fifteen minutes after that our server came by, we had received our drinks and Goat Cheese appetizer beforehand, and he asked us if we wanted bread.  It came halfway through our lunch with the excuse that he had to go across the street to get it (that took approximately 25 minutes) It was cold and butter was not appealing.  Strange!!!  The kicker, but not the last thing, unfortunately, was when my daughter ordered her second Peach Bellini, the waiter, when he finally got around to asking if we needed anything, asked if it was okay if he used the same glass since they were running out of glassware.  We had never had a request like that before, ANYWHERE!!!  He gave us a dessert menu, and we decided to take a piece of Key Lime Pie/Tart home, only to be made aware, after waiting another fifteen minutes for his return, to be told  they didn't have Key Lime Pie, they only had Creme Brulee which should have been mentioned when the menus were given to us; wouldn't you think?  Overall,  this restaurant, in my opinion, is way over glorified.  To even say it's cute is reaching.  It seems their staff /organization needs an overhaul.   And I think the food is very fair.  If you are used to good ambiance, good service and overall good food with a SMILE, pick another venue!!!  Needless to say,  we won't be going back.",

Only 2 problems...sat there for way too long before a server came to see if I wanted any drink...like a good 20 minutes.  We did stay there a long time catching up but they were not busy.  Only once did anyone ask about coffee or water refill.  And the weekend brunch menu says they have an omelet bar...nope.  I will go back tho,maybe even next weekend.",

They have a CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY BABY CAKE I couldn't stop thinking about. It's worth the drive. I needed a great place to celebrate a girlfriends birthday & I knew this was the place to satisfy our foodie palate. Our meal was delicious from the chicken & mushroom crepes to the chicken & strawberry salad. I'd talked up the chocolate raspberry baby cake to all the girls & couldn't wait to get to dessert. Then the unthinkable happened...... We were told they no longer have the chocolate raspberry cake....... WHAT????? The dessert I dream about, the dessert that brought us all the way from the east valley is no longer on the menu? We were nearly brought to tears! We ordered an apple crisp, baby coconut cake & baby tuxedo cake. All were delicious but for the love of all things chocolate & divine, PLEASE bring back the chocolate raspberry baby cake.",

I usually split them into lunch and dinner.  The dressings are made not bought.  Luckily I've dropped down to working just one day a week because my pants were about to pop at the seams.  Oh and the staff is always in a good mood.  Very friendly.  They usually have discounted pastries after 2pm.",

The waitress said they make all of their dressings in house and they're all vinegar based. I appreciate their homestyle, more health conscious approach. Everything seemed very fresh and light.   I was also fortunate enough to try the brownies and chocolate hazelnut bars. Both were delicious and able to satisfy my chocolate craving sweet tooth.   The service was also great. My brother was over an hour late and she was very cool about keeping his food warm until he came and us staying and talking for a while after we were finished. I would definitely come back.",

I ordered the Pesto Grilled Shrimp Salad, which was fabulous until I had an allergic reaction to it and spent 20 min throwing up in the bathroom. Lovely, I know.  Arcadia Farms isn't to blame though because I'm allergic to everything!  Last week we skipped out on the beautiful atmosphere and picked up our salads to go. Of course I stayed away from the shrimp salad this time and went with some sort of grilled chicken salad. I ate up every last bite and no allergic reactions this time around. Whoo hoo!

I ordered the salmon with baby vegetables over greens, the others ordered the goat cheese/mushroom/chicken tart, and the goat cheese/mushroom crepe.  When I saw the tart, I was kicking myself for not going that route.  But one bite of the delicious salmon and I was just fine with my choice.  The baby carrots, green beans, and fingerling potato's were cooked perfectly al dente. The friends raved about the tart and the crepe.  We ended the meal by sharing the red velvet cake.  One slice was HUGE and was layered with cream cheese frosting....YUMM!!!!!  Oh, and I failed to mention that Wednesday is HALF PRICE bottle of wine day!  OMG, we totally scored!!!

The restaurant is completely adorable with a couple of different buildings, the main one having segmented rooms just like a house. The chairs and table are all mismatched in a charming way and I almost expect to see my grandmother come from around a corner wearing an apron and a light dusting of flour.  Gabi and I had lunch here on my last day in town and we requested a table in the back room in hopes that it would be a tad bit less noisy. And even though we were there for a meeting and pulled out our laptops to work for a bit our server never batted an eye and she took excellent care of us.  I ordered the chicken and warm veggies salad and added avocado, a trick that Gabi shared with me. It was pretty much a chop salad, which I actually really like. What is it about places that give you gargantuan pieces of lettuce in a salad? I mean I know it may seem like I have a big mouth, but there's no way I'm fitting that in gracefully. I also ordered the iced tea, which I highly, highly recommend. It tasted like it's brewed with fruit and it's oh-so-delicious!",

Two, clients don't want to walk next door.  I give it 4/5 due to the food being so good (farm to table) and the atmosphere.  The service can be hit or miss.  There is one older woman who just moved to AZ who I think is wonderful, but others didn't have much personality.",

I had a hard time choosing between many foods that I love: crab cakes, goat cheese, crepes... I wanted something lighter so I ordered the oriental chicken salad. In the meantime, our drinks were brought to the table. BFF pulled the spoon out of her iced tea to find that there was some leftover peanut butter still on it. The question is: who left it there? Don't know. Gross. This was pointed out to a server (not ours because she had not returned to our table). Our server brought out a new iced tea. She was polite, but not necessarily apologetic.   When our meal was delivered to the table, BFF pointed out that there were tomatoes on her sandwich (she asked for no tomatoes). The server said that the other server probably grabbed the wrong plate. She came back from the kitchen twice to tell us that the new sandwich would be right out. So, I sat with my salad and waited to eat until BFF got her meal (It took a good 5-10 minutes for her new sandwich to come out).   BFF raved about the dressing on her side salad. My salad was fine, but nothing to rave about (especially not for $13). The ingredients were fresh but the \"shredded chicken\" that was described on the menu appeared to be sliced chicken breast. To be honest, I prefer shredded chicken which is why I had decided on that particular salad. DISAPPOINTING.  The server arrived at the table to ask if we wanted to order dessert. We replied, \"no, thank you\". And she said something like, \"oh, come on, are you sure?\". Again, we declined but I really think she should have offered us free dessert after our bummer lunch.  The topper? 1 valet guy and 6 people in line to pick up their cars=a 10 minute wait just to leave the place.   I would hesitate to come back, but that menu is just so damn tempting.",

    "text": "Arcadia Farm is a Phoenix standby, I moved here over 10 years ago, it was thriving then and it's still thriving. It's a ladies who lunch kind of place full of nutritious, delicious light lunch fares and a wait staff with extremely low turn over. It is not surprising to find a wait staff who has worked there for over ten years.  I used to go there often with clients when I had my architectural office but it's been years since I was there last.  When Lindsey organized a CMYE $3 donation (for a delicious baby cake) to St. Mary's Food Bank, I happily signed up.  There were 15 of us there and we were seated in a private back room with fresh flowers on the table, very nice.  The waitress was very friendly and bragged about the owner which is always a good sign when the staff is happy. My friend and I ordered the crab cake and grilled shrimp salad to share and although it took awhile for the food to arrive, it was delicious.  They also surprised us with complimentary hummus, pasta with grilled shrimp, and a desert tray. So really, we didn't have to order any food and we would have been plenty full! The generosity of the owner who I hope one day to have the pleasure to meet as she seems like the kind of wonderful lady I would enjoy sharing a conversation with, is apparent. And this stands to reason why after so many years when many restaurants have opened and closed, Arcadia Farm is still as successful and popular as ever.  I and Yelp thank you for a generous and enjoyable afternoon of lunching!",

Considering it was a random week day that I went to eat lunch/ brunch here, the tables were quickly getting filled with ladies chattering away... I liked the back patio dining area, it was filled with greenery and flowers through out the back area.    I had the following AF Classics:  Chicken, leek, and wild mushroom crepes: the crepes were filled with a savory cream sauce that wasn't too overbearing with the creamy texture.  What I liked about this dish was the abundant amount of fresh sliced pieces of chicken and bits of mushroom that didn't have a salty aftertaste.  Wild mushroom, spinach, and goat cheese tart:  you have to have acquired taste for any dish that has goat cheese, and this dish had just the right amount in which it wasn't salty nor too creamy that it feels like cheese cake.  The tart was baked in a golden brown, but not too well done.   My friend and I ordered a bottle of champagne for mimosas, it was some kind of daily special that they had for the champagne and fresh OJ, paired up with strawberries.    If I ever visit Scottsdale again, I would definitely make this my number 1 spot to have brunch!",

Unfortunately my friend had to meet early so the place was pretty empty when we were here. I say \"unfortunately\" because we missed out on the show...that is we missed out on watching the \"ladies who lunch\" like it's there job in action. Oh well, at least we had free reign on where to sit, so we got a nice spot on the patio.   The menu is pretty much salads, sandwiches, soups, and a few other similar items. I decided to go with a California club, which was pretty delicious. I got it with potato salad, which was pretty yummy as well. Everything tasted fresh. The one slight complaint that I had was that the potatoes in the potato salad were undercooked. However, it had bacon it it so I can't complain, and actually when I had my leftovers a few hours later the potatoes weren't as hard so it's all good.   My friend and I also split some bread pudding for dessert which was beyond delicious! It was moist and had raspberries in it! I was actually surprised by how big the portions were (for both the dessert and the entrees...my friend got a salad which was pretty big as well). I just didn't expect that from this kind of place. It's a little pricey, but for what you get I think it's worth it.   I'll be back at Arcadia Farms when visiting Scottsdale, but when I do I wanna come by when it's a little more crowded to watch the show (and possibly even join in!).",

It has an open airy feeling with the large patio seating area in back and front patio.  There is ample space for many tables so it does not feel crowded.  There are multiple staff and I was served by no less than 5-6 people, (so much for continuity).  They were pleasant enough, but looked a bit overworked and under paid, (you know the type).  I'd like to give the place 3 stars, but  I couldn't go that far since that means \"A-OK\", which this place is not.  My food was done on the cheap.  My fruit plate $7.00 consisted of a couple large sliced strawberries, two really very tiny grapes, and a few hunks of mellon (the inexpensive ones).  Yes, everything is cut in large hunks -- a labor saving technique, (not because it is chic).  The omelet I ordered was supposed to be wild mushroom and chives $12.  What actually arrived was an overcooked and dry omelet with a daab of cream cheese in the center and a few bits of mushroom and chives around the edges. Upon first glance it looked like it contained mushrooms (not really wild, eh?), and chives, but upon opening the omelet these only appeared around the edges.  Such trickery !!!  There was also a serving of home fries, again cut in large hunks.  I'm sure this restaurant serves a need for some but I won't be back anytime soon.",

    "text": "I'm so happy! After years of enjoying a sit-down experience at Arcadia Farms and months of anticipation for the marketplace doors to open, I can officially say that I am one very happy yelper!   First of all, I want to wrap the Arcadia Farms Marketplace up and put it in my pocket; it's so cute inside and out! It's like a dream farmhouse and one I could be quite comfortable in for hours. Maybe it has something to do with the tasty sweets and treats staring me in the face too.  The marketplace is stocked full of food for all and friendly staff serving it. I always loved visiting the Phoenix Art Museum Arcadia Farms because I'd have a great chat with Lisa G. So, needless to say how pleased I was when I walked into the Marketplace to see her behind the counter! We had a great chat and she told me all about the wonderful items they serve! They have everything from tea packets and flowers to scones, cookies, brownie pops and nutella. They also have their miniature cakes ready for purchase as well as their tasty iced tea and lemonade. The salads are pre-made every morning and waiting in the refrigerator to be eaten. They have tuna nicoise, turkey club, their famous strawberry chicken salad, a garden salad, pasta salad and chicken curry salad with raspberry sauce. They also have a detailed breakfast and sandwich menu that are made-to-order. Besides a couple classics, this menu is different and it's lower in price. The sandwiches range from roast beef and mozzarella and to pressed chicken. They have a lot of options on the menu. I also heard they are introducing a limited dinner menu. It's still not a \"cheap\" meal, but it's competitive to other lunch options out there at about $8-$9 for a sandwich and $8-$9 for a salad.   So now that I've given a recap of what I saw at the marketplace, I will report on what I ate! It was tough...so tough to decide between a sandwich and salad. I wanted both! Then the more I looked at the chicken curry salad, the more appealing it looked, so I opted for that. Verdict? Very pleased!! The chicken curry has a sweetness to it and then the raspberry dressing is the perfect addition. Arcadia Farm's pesto shrimp salad is addicting and I think that this one might be up there with that level of addiction! It was the perfect size and filled me up without making me want to roll out of there. For my beverage, I went for the raspberry ice tea. And yes, today I decided my sweet tooth would win over my willpower, so I took a lemon cake muffin for the road. In summary, it was a very summeresque meal and very fulfilling! I sat outside at their tables in the front. I wish they had indoor seating but it seems like the indoor seating is only for the private event catering. But then again, this is a marketplace and the purpose is for people to get in and out.   Speaking of the private catering room, it is absolutely adorable in there. Arcadia Farms is the perfect place for a bridal or baby shower or ladies lunch, but the restaurant itself can be a little cramped so it makes it hard. Therefore, this is a great alternative! If I ever need to plan a ladies-only party, hands-down this will be my first choice.   In summary, I definitely see myself becoming a regular at the Arcadia Farm's Marketplace. I still love the sit-down Arcadia Farms, but when I don't have time to sit down and have a ladies lunch, I'm very happy that they've given me this alternative!!",

It is my go to place when I need a pick me up during the work week. All of the staff is cute young friendly young ladies. However, the last time I went a girl with red hair was very condescending to the both of us. It made me not want to go back. I did not like the way she called elderly customers sweetie and honey. She seemed bothered to serve our food to us outside and would fake a smile and go off and talk about us to the valet outside. Not a great time and the market place but I will still be back",

    "text": "This place is fantastic. I feel like I am attending a tea party every time I go here.  I have tried three of their salads and all of them have been delicious. You cannot go wrong with the Signature Strawberry Salad with grilled chicken, vine-ripened strawberries, mixed baby greens, toasted almonds and poppyseed vinaigrette. It's mouth-watering! I have also had the Greek Salad which is yummy.   Today, I tried the Raspberry Salad with Fossil Creek Goat Cheese, which has organically grown baby lettuces, fresh raspberries, warm goat cheese medallions, jicama, carrots, and candied pecans with a raspberry vinaigrette. I am not a fan of jicama - mainly because its tasteless. But this salad was AMAZING! I could of licked the plate but that would not have been very lady like of me.   Overall, this is one of my favorite restaurants and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a breakfast/lunch spot in Old Town.",

Beautiful trees, waterfalls, flowers etc...surrounding the patio. Great place to catch up with friends.   Just a heads up, definitely an older crowd...and most of the clientele are women :)",

Arcadia Farms was a recommendation from our concierge at The Royal Palms. We had lunch in the back garden at Arcadia Farms.  It was just lovely!! Everything about it!  The service was so friendly, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was so peaceful!  All of the food tasted so fresh, so good...I think our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, Everything on the menu looked so good...we wanted to experience it all!  We started with the Crab and Avocado Tower and Savory Smoked Salmon Cheesecake - both were so delicious! The servings were large...we had to leave some left on the plates :-(  Then we shared the wild mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart, so good!  We had dessert, fresh berries.  Just Lovely!!",

My surprise came today when I saw in my bank statement a different amount and the manager told me that their machine pre-authorized all the transactions with 20% more and in couple of days I`ll see the right amount. I can live with that but I don`t think it is right and every body should know about it and check their statement.",

The service was super weird and I was on the fence between a 3 and a 4 star rating because of the strange service. When we went to order we were disallowed to let the women at the table order first and we had to arbitrary order in an order that the server required. I don't get this at all. Then she gave us some scones and weirdly said...\"the last of the scones.\" Not sure if she was trying to be funny or something strange but it made our entire table rethink trying them. Were they stale or were they going to throw away these improperly baked scones? What was so wrong with them that they were the last of the scones?   The worst part was the strange location of the mens and womens bathroom. Not a complete deal breaker but the women's bathroom was clogged so everyone was using the single serving men's bathroom. I decided against waiting in the huge line of women gathered in front of the men's room and went down the street to Starbucks. Very weird and I then realized why I could get a reservation for 5 people on a Sunday at prime brunch time. This place just kept missing the target.   Good food but everything else was way off.",

The restaurant was not busy, tons of open seating yet me and my friend are standing here in the heat not being helped. A lady approached and the same hostess greeted her and this lady had a reservation, this woman was offered a seat and some water while she waited....I guess if you don't have a reservation you're a peasant at Arcadia Farms. Finally another gentleman employee asked if we were being helped right in front of the hostess and she looked at us as if she were confused why we were still here (these peasants aren't leaving unfed). Oh you're waiting on me she said? Good thing I helped myself to some never offered free water, I would have shriveled out here! Anyways we finally got seated next to a very pretentious obnoxious party of 4 where I had to listen to how they couldn't handle being in my state (NY) because it was dirty, and inconvenient. Ok anyways, so all around bad vibes, bad atmosphere, bad hostess and the fucking dry sandwich was mediocre at best. I ordered the turkey and Brie (this peasant appreciates the finer things) and it was just literally that; turkey, one slice of Brie slapped on something they were probably identifying as farm bread but my bestie peasant across the table from me grew up on a god damn farm and that shit was from cosco! I had to grab a handful of lettuce from besties plate and shove it in that dry monstrosity of a sandy. I forgot to mention, I felt judged when I ordered the potato salad as my side instead of the leafy fucking greens (which I wish I had ordered because it needed to be inside the sandwich). Whatever, don't offer carbs with carbs and load it with bacon chunks if you want to be a judgy. Fuck you  Arcadia farms come to upstate NY and I'll show you some real farm food.",

The service was great, my coffee mug was never less than half full, and the server was friendly. She even brought us complimentary scones while we waited for the rest of our party to show up! I had the two eggs, potatoes, and bacon plate... super basic, I know, but it was yummy and tasted as it should. I added an English muffin just for good measure and they even toasted it so perfectly that the nooks and crannies were crunchy.  I'll definitely",

    "text": "I went to Scottsdale last weekend to stay with friends and go to the Interpol concert. After an amazing concert Saturday night, we went to breakfast Sunday morning at Arcadia Farms. My friends who live in Scottsdale had raved about this restaurant, so I said 'yes! let's go Sunday morning!' I'm so very happy that we did!   First of all, the place itself is so charming and adorable! I love the black & white sofas, white chairs and black & white framed photos on the walls. We sat just inside the first room, right behind the scrumptious baked goods! It was difficult to decide what to order, everything sounded wonderful. But I chose the Wild Mushroom & Chive Omelet with goat cheese, fresh fruit, potatoes and a side of Applewood Smoked Bacon and fresh squeezed orange juice. My friend Chantage chose the same thing, but opted for a side of toasted ciabatta bread - we shared the bread and bacon! And my friend Lisa chose the Breakfast Pannini with rosemary infused ham, white cheddar and scrambled eggs on a fresh baked baguette, also served with fresh fruit. The fresh squeezed orange juice was a delicious way to begin our meal. Our omelets were so yummy - the goat cheese was the perfect choice to top the mushrooms and chives. The potatoes were slightly dry, but still had a lovely flavor. The fresh fruit was refreshing and Lisa loved her pannini! Of course, we had to pick up some of their fresh baked pastries on the way out. Chantage bought an almond croissant that was to die for! Yes, I had a bite and it was wonderful. Lisa chose one as well, but also took other pastries home for her husband, aww...  All in all, this cafe is high on my ever-growing list of favorite restaurants in Scottsdale/Phoenix! I can't wait to come back when the market opens across the street so I can bring some of this deliciousness back to Tucson!",

Last few times I have ordered, there is less than a 1/4 cup of vegetables, literally not even a whole stock of asparagus, teeny bite of roasted red pepper.  What has happened?  $13 dollars for a bowl of romaine lettuce??  Used to serve warm rolls with butter.  Not serving any bread and do not offer.  When we ask we got a hunk of stale bread.  I always get the chocolate toffee cookie, which usually is very moist/brownie like with large gooey toffee pieces.  Not any more, not moist and one teeny piece of toffee.  Not worth it!  Apparently someone is cutting the quality and value of the food for larger profit margins!  Yikes, please put it back the way it was, or we won't be back nor will we bring our out of town friends.  Really very disappointing for such a landmark restaurant.",

    "text": "Alright boys, get past the fact that it's a little chick centric, Arcadia Farms is a great place to grab a light bite, but leave feeling satisfied and content.   My group of 3 split the hummus appetizer, and wholly garbanzo bean batman, it was the best hummus I've ever had. It's creamy in texture, strong on garlic and citrus flavor, and served with crispy pita chips that are perfectly seasoned. Next up, the Warm Chopped Vegetable Salad with Grilled Chicken. (Let me pause here: I feel it's my duty to let the Yelp community know that I'm not really a leafy salad guy. I'm  pretty serious when it comes to dining out and don't usually go for the greens. In this instance though, the salad was the first menu item that jumped out at me, and so I felt it was a must. Considering I was there with two people that ordered the same thing, two people that have been to Arcadia Farms, I felt like it was a pretty solid decision.)   The atmosphere is eclectic end energetic. The restaurant itself is sectioned off into little rooms, and a few times throughout our lunch, I found myself checking out the architecture and the history behind the pretty old building. I suggest calling ahead and making a reservation, or taking your lunch grub back to the office. When I was there on a Monday, the place was packed! And it's no surprise why; great food, good ambiance, and attentive service. Prices seemed a little steep for lunch, but you're paying for an experience, so take someone you're trying to impress and take your time to enjoy.",

We waited 20 minutes before the server even came around to take our order.  We had empty glasses almost the whole time.   We had dirty plates sitting in front of us for at least 15 minutes.

I have been all over the Scottsdale scene, so it's a wonder it took me so long to get around to trying this place out. Let me begin by saying that this cafe is ADORABLE. I can't imagine a cuter lunch place if I tried and I'd come here again and again just for the sweet atmosphere. The service was quick and we were well attended to. My only qualm is that the menu is somewhat limited. There is a giant list of salads with an additional small list of meals that all included goat cheese or brie, which I am not fond of. In the end, I chose a strawberry salad. It was fine, but I don't really like salads, so for all I know it was the greatest salad ever and I just do not have the right palate to judge salads. But lucky for Arcadia Farms, the experience is more important to me than the food itself, and I had a great time. I will most likely return, as I am just totally in love with this beautiful little gem.",

Their service is wonderful, every server I've had here has gone above and beyond to give the best service. Once the server even went across the street to get a dessert for us because they were out in the main kitchen, she even put it together for us. Every experience I have had at this restaurant has been a positive one.   The food is great also, their brie appetizer is so delicious as is their bruschetta. For entrees I seriously love their chicken and mushroom crepes, it sounds weird but trust me you have to try it. Honestly everything I have ordered their has been good.  When you go you must order the chocolate raspberry cake dessert oh my goodness I could go just for that.  As far as it being for girls only, i don't agree with that the food is made for both sexes and the servers are all female and all hot so what more could you ask for great food and hot servers...",

After a while we had to ask who our server was because people whom sat down after us were already served and many workers that walked past us, didn't even look at us. We got placed in the back corner of the restaurant despite our reservation and plenty other open tables. Took 20 minutes just to get a salad. 1: I hate to complain, 2: I hate to waste, 3: I hate to cause problems but, BEWARE the raspberry goat cheese salad with added chicken. The chicken tasted like CRAB of all things. It was like eating a crab/fish salad. After having to flag down our server again I told her about my strange salad and all I got was an \"oh I'm sorry\" while she was still walking past us while I was trying to explain, and she left again. We later had to flag her down for a check as well. I suppose they thought giving us two free cookies made up for the $17-$18 salad that somehow tasted like fish. Used to love this place. Now I'm not sure if I'll be back.",

    "text": "Sometimes when I eat I enjoy going out on my own. As a concierge at one of the hotels in old town Scottsdale it is important to me to try all the restaurants in town so I have places to recommend. based on my experience Arcadia farms is off that list.  So today I passed a test I've preparing for for over a year and thought it would be great to celebrate with a delicious meal at a place I've wanted to try for so long now! I walked in to arcadia farms market place first and the girl working was so sweet and helpful. I should have just eaten there. I didnt eat there though because I really wanted to sit down with a mimosa (my favorite) and enjoy a meal.   As I walked in to the restaurant the hostess looked at me like I was crazy when I told her it was just me. she had to process the fact that I was a solo diner for a good minute. I asked if I could sit outside and she sat me in a spot directly in the sun. I was so hot! Arcadia farms looks adorable and the menu looked fantastic so I figured I could be a little warm as long as I had a cold beverage. I sat, and I sat and I sat. Still no server, no water, no anything. I sat for a good 15 minutes at least. I even witnessed the table next to me get helped twice and the table across from me was served drinks and had their orders taken from the women that sat me.    Needless to say I got up and left without the meal I've been hoping for for so long. 15 minutes without even water on the table is laughable. Apparently eating alone is not acceptable at Arcadia Farms. I considered going back to order at the market place but I honestly don't want to give the company my money at all anymore. I went to eat down the street and had a wonderful experience with water on my table faster than arcadia farms hostess could even say hello.  I will never be back and I will never recommend this place to my guests.",

    "text": "Hard to believe that in the bustle of Old Town- there sits a little house tucked away serving some of the best food that I have had since coming to Scottsdale. Arcadia Farms may just be my new favorite place in town.   A friend of mine suggested it for lunch so I ventured there on a sunny, cool afternoon. I was a little worried as I pulled up as there was alot going on from a line of cars in the front to a harried valet trying to get people to follow the que. As for me- I spied a spot on the street and just parked and walked back to the restaurant wondering all the while if I should have made a reservation. But it was no problem.   I was asked if I wanted to be seated outside (yes, please) so I got a cute little table on the front patio- but there is also outside seating in the back plus all the little rooms of the house have cute little cozy seating arrangements in them.   Arcadia Farms serves organic, locally grown ingredients in all of its offerings. And they also have wonderful pastries and desserts that are prepared in the bakery located across the street. I watched as they brought tray after tray of mouth watering goodies that I knew I would have to save room for.   I ordered a range of items just so I could try them as everything sounded so good. To begin- the crab and avocado tower was terrific. Blue crab stacked with avocado and red peppers was a lovely presentation and tasted even better.   My server, Erica was quick with suggestions so I went with the herb roasted chicken sandwich with goat cheese and artichokes on a baguette. Delicious although I could only eat half of it as I was saving room for a bite of the coconut \"baby\" cake.   A baby cake? What was that, I wondered. Must be like a cupcake. Nope. Bigger than a cupcake smaller than a cake ,this \"baby cake\" would be perfect split 3 ways. The good news was that they wrapped the cake up for me so I shall eat cake for the next few days!   The serve wine, beer and some signature drinks. I went with my server's wine recco and it was perfect. Nothing better than sitting outside on a beautiful day, glass of wine in hand, people watching.   This is not a cheap place. My bill was $55 before tip (food was $35 and wine was $20) although I do have plenty of leftovers for another meal. But the great food, friendly service,and homey ambiance made it all worth it.   Arcadia Farms is the kind of place I look for in every city I travel to. Most of the time I don't find it. But today . . .thanks to a friend's recommendation, I did.",

The Sweet Mascarpone Cheese was overkill, otherwise it could have been a nice, light sweet option.  The Quiche was my favorite and the Cobbler was a close second.  Both savory dishes were full of fresh veggies, cheese and seasoned perfectly.  Our waitress was wonderful, too.  She handled our large group perfectly, and was very accomodating to one of the girls who wasn't feeling so great.  Perfect place for a relaxing, cozy brunch.",

While I've had my eyes set on this cute little patio for quite some time, I was finally able to enjoy the full experience with my mom last week. And it most certainly filled all of my expectations and then some.  The venue is impossibly cute. With an abundance of shade and draping ivy over the patio, outside is definitely the way to enjoy breakfast here. The inside was also quaint with plentiful seating options, so I'm sure as the season gets busy with good weather, an indoor table would hardly be disappointing. The menu has so many tempting options, the most difficult part of our meal was choosing what to eat. We both chose eggs for our \"main\" dish, but couldn't pass up the lemon bread pudding with blueberry sauce and creme fraiche. Holy. Mother. of Bread Pudding. I don't know the secret, but this is one of the best edible items my lips have every come across. We ended up taking our eggs to go after splitting the bread pudding because it was so filling AND it would have been a crime to leave one single crumb on the table. The egg dishes were a delightful lunch after our round of golf.  The service was awesome which made for a holistically pleasant breakfast. I can't wait to return for more bread pudding with a side of lunch next time.",

Arcadia farms obviously hosts many showers and you will be treated as such-- A dime a dozen. They don't care about the customer, just about how much money they make. My advice is to find another venue. There are many, many more options in Scottsdale that are willing to help not just take your money.",

We split the warm brie appetizer which was amazing - came with crostini, grapes, and apple slices. It was perfect with the sangria and we finished every last crumb. For my entree, I got the goat cheese, mushroom and spinach tart and it was delish, my only complaint was that there wasn't more goat cheese in it....one of my favorite cheeses! It came with a simple spinach salad which complimented the flavorful tart very well. They have several desserts, pastries and cookies there that I wanted to try so badly, but I was too full. Next time Arcadia Farms! One thing to note, call to make a reservation - there is typically a wait here but trust me it's worth it.",

It is what appears to be an old farmhouse that was left standing in the middle of Scottsdale busy city life..  The inside is very charming, like stepping into someone's home with all the good smells of cooking.  We didn't make reservations and since it was a Sunday, knew we were pushing it, especially with the after church crowds.  But as luck should have it, was able to sit outdoors and was such a nice sunny day, was great.   I had the Chicken, wild mushroom and leeks crepe..was that ever heavenly!  My husband the strawberry chicken salad, which he also enjoyed..  One thing that drew my attention was that there were a lot of women senior citizens...very well dressed ones...obviously part of the Scottsdale upper crust..I think we were the youngest ones in there.. Next time I'm back in Scottsdale will have to go back..",

    "text": "I brought my daughter here to share what has always been a delicious and lovely experience. Wrong this time! Our waitress, Janis, was never around and ignored all three of her tables on the front patio. We had to ask the hostess to find her so that we could place our order. She was fake friendly with an angry undertone. My warm vegetable chopped salad was brought out without any dressing but I had to wait until the waitress finally surfaced only because our neighboring table had to ask the hostess to find her so they could get their bill. Finally, Janis glanced at us & noticed that my beverage glass was completely empty and I mentioned lack of salad dressing. No apology.  A good 10-15 minutes after my salad had been brought to me, I was finally able to eat it!  My daughter was almost done with her meal by then. Then Janis forgot to give back the 3rd table's credit card but insisted she had.....whoops, she found it after the sweet patron frantically looked all through her purse. As I asked for my bill, Janis jammed a bill with attached credit card at me....not my credit card or my bill though!! I eventually located a young man who appeared to be managing and told him politely that we had very poor service. Friendly smile from him, but no sympathy. Well, in closing, the food was pretty good but the service was horrible. So sad, because I have always loved this place.",

    "text": "I really really wanted to love this place because the menu makes my mouth water and the ambiance was so nice - the gardens and cozy outdoor seating were so beautiful!  We were greeted at our table ten minutes after being seated. We ordered a pitcher of white sangria, the crab and avocado tower, smoked salmon cheesecake and wild mushroom tart. The pitcher of sangria was delicious when it finally arrived (another ten minutes)- the cup had raspberries and a strawberry in it with orange juice and white wine. The crab and avocado tower had corn inside and gazpacho with it. We had to add salt - it was extremely bland. If you just want to taste avocado and crab, you will love it! If you want extra flava', try something else! The smoked salmon cheesecake was disappointing. A little cute cheesecake that looked smooth on the outside, but crumbled into dry cheese balls on the inside with a very tiny portion of smoked salmon served on the side. House cured smoked salmon is one of my most favorite things - this place will not be remembered for this dish. It was the first time I could describe cured salmon as bland! The one good thing that I would eat again and go back for is the wild mushroom tart. Melted cheese over a soft tart with wild mushrooms and leeks - wonderful wonderful savory dish. We never saw our server for most of the meal. If I went back again, I would try one of the big salads I saw at tables around us and that tart again. But I would make sure I went on a day where I had plenty of time for an extremely slow lunch where I don't mind extremely slow service. All in all, comci comca!",

    "text": "What a DISAPPOINTMENT!!  After reading such positive reviews, my friend and I thought we would try it.  First we got sat in a separate building from the main restaurant, but we had to walk through the main restaurant to get there, so we were teased by the charm and quaintness of the restaurant but when we got to our building it was like a sparse, cold, unfinished, not so cozy shell of a room, but hey, we were excited to try the food.  So, we started with the warm brie with caramelized apples appetizer.  Service was slow, and we got our appetizer about 15-20 min later. The brie was super oily, perhaps due to heating it too quickly?  Regardless, it was nothing special.  After we were finished with our appetizer, we waited another 15-20 min for our entrees.  We shared the \"award winning\" strawberry, chicken salad, with poppyseed dressing and the Crepes with wild mushrooms, goat cheese and leeks.  The \"award Winning\" strawberry chicken salad was nothing special.  Honestly, Paradise Bakery and Wildflower Bread Co have better salads.  The Crepes were a little better  and more savory but there was a hair in our crepes as we were cutting into them.  We brought it to our waitress' attention and she did not apologize, instead, just looked at us and said, what do you want me to do?  I asked if they could just remake it.  The remake Crepes came out a little more quickly than the first time, except this time, they were burned.  We didn't say anything to the waitress, as we just kinda accepted the fact that maybe it wasn't our day, at this point we just wanted to get our check and get out of there.  In the meantime, we heard the table next to us complain to their waitress that her crabcakes tasted like ammonia (a sign of SPOILED food), and another table was complaining that the service was slow and they had to be somewhere and ended up having to box their food up to go.  Honestly, the apricot iced tea was the best part of our whole meal.  We will NOT be returning to this place.",

    "text": "What moves me out of hiatus?  A surprisingly bad expereince at Arcadia.  Terrible.  To be fair, I've eaten here many times before and have had great experiences and find the food delicious.    This past Sunday was a very different story.  Six girlfreinds and I came for brunch and were deciding our meals.  However one of the girls wanted to order from the lunch menu rather than the breakfast menu. We were told that this was possible at 11 am.  Julia, our sweet waitress, informed us that due to the kitchen size those who wanted breakfast had to first place their orders. Then at 11 am, the kitchen would switch out and she could take the lunch order. She was quite clear that the lunch entree would be 5-10 minutes after our breakfasts came out.  My friend didn't mind at all.    What transpired was not okay.  Our breakfasts come out. WE sit and wait 5-10 minutes for her lunch. Nothing comes out so we all eat in front of her. Eh, she thought it was coming out soon.  NOt so much.  Long story short, we waited AN HOUR for her food.  No joke, we all ate, I ordered  second drink, we sat and chatted and still nothing.  OUr waitress was very sweet and you could tell she was embarassed at the time it was taking. WAsn't her fault.  She even brought scones out for my freind to nibble on.  An hour later she decided she wasn't waiting any longer for a SANDWICH. A VEGGIE sandwich at that.  You grill some veggies and slap it on bread.  An hour?  No.  The manager comes out,the waitress must have told him how ridiuclous it was, and offers to give her the sandwich for free.  She stated that was fine, but that she didn't want to sit any longer, if it came out by the time we paid, then great.    What struck me as funny was, they still charged her for hte one drink. Seriously, it took an HOUR for a veggie sandwich and they made her pay for her one mimosa.  The waitress was fantastic and very sympathetic to the ridiculousness, but I'd only give them one more chance.",

My review is based solely on the food brought in for the children specifically.  I've noticed that a lot of the food from this place is nice, but at the same time, some foods are not - especially for children.    For example, one day the company will have a very kid friendly meal such as pizza, but with weird chunks of mozzarella.  Most of the children don't care for the chunks so we're spending lunch picking off the cheese. Other meals that the kids don't like are the cold cheese sandwiches.  Literally, it's just bread, maybe 3-5 pieces of cheese and that's it. Not a whole lot. I've actually had a child say no to their cheese sandwich and begged us to provide him with cheese and crackers.  Every so often they will bring in macaroni that is just gross even to look at.  The pasta is nasty and overcooked and the cheese has no flavor.   I like when they bring in turkey, mashed potatoes and corn.  Their chicken and rice is pretty good. Their spaghetti and meatballs look a lot better than the canned stuff from the grocery store.   I have heard that the restaurant is much better and hopefully one day I'll stop in and see for myself.",

Not as much attention to detail in the presentation. No more hot bread and butter served while waiting for your meal. Smaller portions. Food, always the consistent constant, not so much.   Recently I took my 85-year old mother for lunch to commemorate what would have been my parents' 60th anniversary, as Arcadia Farms had been my mom's favorite restaurant for many years. We waited and waited. Once we ordered an appetizer, it came sailing out, followed literally a couple of minutes later by our entrees (my mom's crepes were burned and hard, and when I was sticking my fork into the bowl of shrimp salad, surprise, no bowl. It has been shrunk to the point that it is now served on a plate).  The waitress looked at us and said, oh, you're not ready, then plopped our meals on the table and fled. We did not see her again for half an hour after we had finished. We planned on dessert; Mom loves the coconut baby cake, but no server. We opted for ice cream on the way home. It will be a very long time before we return, if ever. Too many quality restaurants more deserving of our investment of time and especially of money.   Sad to see the decline in what had been a favorite and favored restaurant.",

The service was not good at all, especially at the end when the waitress for our party was extremely pushy to add an additional tip and led me to believe that her tip was not included in the service fee. After the fact I realized that I was tricked and she got a double tip (on awful service) However the food was good and the ambiance was cute so I decided to give it a try one more time this past weekend.  In booking the event, employees were very inconsistent. From room minimums to things included. When I got there to set up, it must have been our waitresses first time doing an event, because once again MANY things that I was told would happen, she said wasn't correct. Super frustrating! Then to top it all off they brought in the wrong dessert from what we had preordered. Not only would they not switch it out to what the 'guest of honor' wanted, they then didn't even try to make it right. I could go on and on. Unfortunately, the service is awful here and I not only DO NOT RECOMMEND them, I won't be using them again. It sucks, because the food is good and it has potential to be a good place to have events, but that is not worth the headache and hassle of everything else.",

Waite patiently for 15 minutes with only 5 parties ahead of me.  Politely told them 1 please. The harried hostess said you will have to sit outside.  I said no I'm sorry it's too cold today.  and she said sorry I have too many reservations.  I said then any reason you don't have a \"reservations only sign\"on your long Check in line? She said excuse me?  I left  The reason was simple. She was taking any walk in that would make her money. But not a table that she perceived would not. She was literally calculating dollars sense and time and throwing out customers real time  to maximize profit to table.    Her prerogative..  Mine to never eat their again and make sure as many folks as possible realize this sleazy place treats their customers as nothing but a financial equation   Highly HIGHLY not recommended.

Once the hostess showed she really seemed to have no idea what to do and didn't acknowledge any of the approximately 20 people waiting in line to check in.  We were finally put on the wait list after standing out front like lost puppies watching the staff ignore us for 15 or so minutes. Then, once we were brought back to our table we saw the restaurant had MANY open tables. I had assumed up until then the restaurant was crazy busy and frazzled from a rush. Nope, apparently just incompetent. So we sat, waited for our server... waited some more... continued to wait as restaurant staff walked by and never acknowledged us, even though I could see them look at us from time to time. Waited patiently for maybe 15-20 minutes for someone to at least say hello and acknowledge we were there to give them our business. But, nothing. So we left. After spending about 45 minutes at this place with essentially no service we decided to take our money elsewhere. Absolutely will never return.",

Not only Farm to Table with organic salads for me, but also a wide variety of sandwiches and entrees for hubby. He ordered the hot ham sandwich with melted mozzarella, red onion chutney, mustard aioli on rosemary baguette. Loved it, and side of potato salad too...polished off both of them even though he's not a big eater at lunchtime. I ordered the Cobb Salad which perfectly fits my Keto plan without substitutions. Chicken, Bacon, Avocado, Bleu Cheese crumbles, on greens with bleu cheese vinaigrette.  The vinaigrette was far too tangy for the salad so I supplemented with plain evoo. And the salad was not bad, but there was nothing wow about it.  I would recommend something else because this menu is amazing and all the food on tables around us looked fantastic.",

    "text": "Arcadia Farms is a promising brunch spot in a great location that is hindered by extremely poor management. Arcadia Farms is broken up into three locations: a cafe, a quick togo pick up market, and a private venue for rent across the street. I only went to to the cafe part of Arcadia Farms. Its a beautiful location that is quite large. And this is where the good news stops. I waited for 45 minutes to eat here thing that the food and service would be excellent due to there low table to wait staff ratio. While waiting, several other names were called (at least 6) but the customers had already left. Once our name had been I was quickly seated outside where it was abundantly clear how under staffed the restaurant was. There were roughly 30 unused tables. Keep in mind people were still waiting outside. It took 15 minutes for a waiter to get our drinks. I had ordered thier \"southern peach tea\" that was fresh out of a Keurig K cup. This is when our experience turned intolerable. Our waiter stated that they were out of a beer, and recommend another. This would have been fine other than the fact that the table to our left had ordered two of the exact same beer AFTER us and received both. Our we airer then explain led to use that they were out of wheat bread, sourdough, white, croissants, and jam at 11:00 on a Saterday morning. I later asked another waitress and she replied with \"we are only have the croissants, we do have the beer that you would like as well as all of our breads\". We waited another 30 minutes for our food only to get way to frustrated and hungry, and leave. While we waited another take received food they did not order. There were two waiters serving 15 customers while three waiter served a private party of nine. There were two private parties meaning that six waiters were serving roughly 20 people while the rest of us suffered horrendous service. There is a huge potential here with and ability to seat over 200 people comfortably, but the focus on private parties and poor staff management left me feeling hungry and confused at how the establishment made any money. The manager gave my table free drinks as the had messed up our whole morning, the table to our right free breakfast as they received the wrong food, and the table behind us free champagne as their experience was also horrible. I'm giving this establishment two stars as they have a great venue and location, along with a very friendly owner who is constantly cleaning up her absolutely pathetic, if you can even call them this wait staff. Ans yes that was a pun. In total we spent one hour and fourty five minutes only to receive the wrong beer, cold coffee and a k cup tea.",

The service was outstanding, very attentive and walked us through the menu since it was our first time dining there. We went with the pesto grilled shrimp salad and herb roasted chicken sandwich with potato salad, both were delicious and packed with so much flavor. We were beyond full from the meal and didn't get a chance to try any of their desserts or pastries, we will definitely be back to try their brunch menu in the near future.",

The place seemed a bit stuffy at the get go, mostly because they asked if I had a reservation while half the tables sat empty. However, once seated (under a tree in the patio area), everything changed for the best. Really nice, casual place with friendly staff.  I ordered the turkey and brie sandwich. It was AWESOME! It was a nice combination of turkey, jam and cheese, all on some delicious bread. It came with a side of tasty potato salad. One of my friends ordered the Strawberry Chicken salad, which immediately became the envy of our table. If I'm around Scottsdale in the future, I will definitely be back :)",

I ended up choosing Arcadia Farms Cafe and can't say enough about the experience which was perfect from start to finish. The cost was comparable if not better than anywhere else I looked.  I worked with Roseann whose help over the phone was incalculable. When I arrived the day of the event about an hour before the event was set to start the room was completely set up, and the settings and atmosphere looked elegant for the occasion. Our server was Kathryn.  Even though a surprise extra guest showed up, Kathryn accommodated me, adding extra food and an extra sitting with ease and taking over so that I could be an un-rattled hostess.  At the end, even the valet suggested a place to have a group photo (under the tree next to the lot) and took a picture for us.  The locale, presentation and taste of the food was way beyond expectation and the positive memories will last for a long time. I will be forever grateful for Arcadia Farms Cafe and its catering staff.",

    "text": "A cute and cozy breakfast cafe in the Arts District of Scottsdale serving breakfast and lunch.  I really wanted to like this place -it's really cute and on a nice day it would be a great place to sit and chat and enjoy the many shaded outdoor spots.  Maybe it was the rainy morning but our experience was a bit underwhelming. We arrived at 8, just as they opened and were greeted and given our choice of tables as we were the days first customers.  TIP: essential to have a reservation here (which we did) as it got busier and busier and they turned lots of walk-ins away.  Saying service is leisurely is the most generous way I can describe our experience. Even though we were the first customers, our server didn't drop by for 5-10 minutes with greetings and water. Further, once we ordered, it was over 45 minute wait for the food-breakfast food-French toast and an egg sandwich.  So surprising since typically breakfast fare is the fastest and easiest to prepare.  Maybe they were short of staff or maybe it was just the rain. 4 star food with 2 star service and as I always say, good food is a given; service is what really sets a place apart.  Reluctantly, not recommended.",

We were never told her name but she had dark hair and fish earrings. My sister asked her if the tea was herbal and with a  snotty answer said I do not know. Not I do not know I will go ask but I do not know. It was 12:15 and no food as of yet. We stopped someone to ask what is going on and still no food. We did not even get a refill on our coffee. We were ready to walk out when my brother approached a gentleman(we found out was a manager) (Brain) and we told him that it has been over 1 1/2 hours and still no food. He apologized and said he will find out what was wrong. The waitress had quit waiting on our table, for what reason we have no idea, and thanks to Brain he got our food and drinks and took care of us after almost 2 hours. Brian apologized to all of us (party of 10) and we thanked him for being so attentive and helping us out of a disaster and awful disappointment. Thank you Brain for being there when we needed you.",

    "text": "So disappointed in my visit today. Ordered the tart (it's basically a quiche) and it was over cooked on the outside so much so that it was served with the outside crust literally broken in pieces and off the tart. Presentation was SAD!  The worst part is when i cut into the tart the center was RAW and liquid eggs came rolling out. So gross. I sent it back and received another plate 25 minutes later (my friend had already finished their meal!). Again presentation was terrible with over cooked crust completely dried out and broken in crumbles around the plate - but at least runny eggs didn't stream out of the center this time.   BOTH crusts were so dried and nasty. Not acceptable for a $20+ meal.  Manager did offer an $8.00 dessert which we got to-go. We ordered the strawberry shortcake- it was good BUT by the time we got home the whipped cream was basically milk. Put it in a little separate container if people get it to go!!!!  It made the shortcake total mush. It took forever for our check to be picked up and no water refills. All in all a most disappointing meal that I don't care to repeat. EVER.  And comp the sent back meal instead! So so bad.",

The menu is well rounded for many food needs, much is locally sourced with several organic options, made on site. So much attention to every facet.  From start to finish, everything was perfection.

    "text": "My husband and I came here on a Sunday morning & decided to give it a try after we saw the reviews. The atmosphere is very \"Sunday brunch\" themed, so perfect for getting brunch/lunch and mimosas with the girls, or just going out for something nice on a weekend morning. We started off with the unsweetened peach tea, along with the Brie and strawberries & bread appetizer. He had the crab cakes, while I had the hot chicken sandwich with potato salad. The food here was AMAZING. Everything we had was full of flavor, the presentation was good, you can taste the freshness with every bite you had. It was exactly what we were looking for as far as wanting something light and healthy. For dessert, we had the chocolate raspberry baby cake, which was to die for! Overall, VERY good experience at this place, we will definitely be coming back here when we're back in town!",

During cooler months, you can dine al fresco under some shade trees/bushes, and then seperate dining \"rooms\" inside. Low ceilings w/antique-ey brick-a-brack/tchotchkes adourned on walls. Feel like I'm back eating in my Gramma Esther's kitchen. Ahhhhh :)  -Elborate menu choices at a nice number. I tend to get overwhelmed if menu offers too much.   -Friendly service. Warm smiles were everywhere and frequent check-ins.  -Quality food. I tried Pesto Shrimp Salad and was satisfied; however, they could have upped the pesto on mine as it was a tad skimpy. Had a bite of the Mushroom Tart and it was DAMN good. Desserts looked tasty as well.  Areas of opportunity:  -Housekeeping. Big chunks of food found as I pulled my chair out to sit. That's just gross. It wld be very quick and easy to do a light sweeping as patrons left, IMO, being that they have wood floors.  -Follow through. Had to remind our Server 3x to split our bill 3 ways. Also, never did get my lemon wedges for my chemical-tasting water. Booo!",

They were nice enough to squeeze our group of four in on the patio. The service was extremely slow but I wrote it off because we were an unexpected party.   This weekend I had a group of 8 meeting here. I called in the morning to try and change my 11:30am reservation to 7 guests. I couldn't get through all morning, when I finally did the lady who answered the phone informed me that they were closed due to a circuit breaker issue in the kitchen and that the manager called all the people who had reservations. I did not get a call from anyone regarding this issues. So at 11am on a busy Sunday I had to find a new place for me and six other people to get into.   I will say the food was very good the first time I went. But the service and this very inconvenient event probably won't have me returning.",

My pesto grilled shrimp salad was refreshing and filling, and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his mushroom spinach goat cheese tart. The restaurant uses local and organic ingredients, and supports family-owned farms.  2) The atmosphere is so welcoming. This place feels like the perfect Mother's Day Brunch spot. It is clean, cozy, and comfortable. We sat on the outside patio under an awning.   Cons:  1) The food is expensive! We dropped $60 on lunch. Yes, LUNCH! For. Two. People. No wonder the majority of the patrons were senior citizens - they have retirement money to blow! I enjoyed the crab and avocado appetizer we ordered, but don't think it was worth $13.  2) The service sucks. Our waitress Janis was not very good. She messed up my order, never checked on us, then silently dropped off our enormous bill without so much as a, \"Thank you for coming in.\" Additionally, they charge for valet parking. Fortunately, we found a free spot down the street.",

Parking is an issue very few spots in the streets but you can valet park which seems what most people do. Very ladies do lunch atmosphere, be careful on your table choice, our original one was in full shade, great for our warm summers but not so good if it's cool. We switched to a table half sun and shade, much better. The food is nothing short of amazing, fresh, great menu choices and very reasonable. This was a long over due catch up so we were happy to wait so don't expect speedy service. Afterwards we walked next door to the marketplace, had freshly made coffee prepared by delightful friendly staff and delicious coffee cake and sat in the sun on the small patio. Wonderful way to spend 2 hours in the heart of old town but tucked away on a quiet side street.",

My husband had the breakfast quesadilla which was good, but my mushroom, spinach and leek tart was just OK -- it was filled with goat cheese (which the menu did not list as an ingredient) and I didn't care for.  The spinach and leeks were a bit slimy too.  Overall, we were pleased and we would definitely try it again, but would make different menu choices.",

    "text": "Dined here for breakfast last Saturday morning. I drove in from Tucson to meet my family that was in from Kansas watching the Royals spring training. My sister found the Arcadia after inquiring at her hotel. Since there were 6 of us, she made a reservation. We were seated immediately. However, it took 10 minutes to get water, and we only began to get service after I spoke to the hostess that no one had stopped by our table. After the wait for water, we new we should be ready with our drink and food order right away. We ordered (we literally sat there for 20 minutes before we got coffee.)  The food was delivered by a runner, and when 5 of us were served, she asked if \"there was anything else\"? Well, obviously, one of us didn't have their meal. We also had to ask for the two other side items we ordered. So we proceed to eat and my sister says that her eggs are cold. (Thinking she is exaggerating, I touch them with the back of my hand.) Yep, cold. Not barely warm, cold. My daughters french toast was cold as well. The other meals were warmish. Not having the time left to send it back (working on 40 minutes now for breakfast) we ate what we could. I did not bring any of the issues up with management, as my brother in law paid the bill. If he wanted to say something, it was up to him. Tons of seating, but not sure the staff could handle it. I Wouldn't/ couldn't recommend it.",

You would have to wait outside because it's cramped in the hostess area with some ill-placed separators. There's the pastry case in front but it didn't looked appealing as it was very meager in offerings and just out in the open like that.   Unfortunately we were seated at the ultra small table in the literal middle of everything. Another 15 mins went by before we got some water.    We got hummus as a starter and herb chicken sandwich for myself and SO got the wild mushroom crepes.   Hummus was pretty weird. I did not enjoy it. It was super cold and grainy. They mixed in celery to fill it and the taste and texture is way off. I am not a hummus snob, and it's pretty hard to mess it up but this failed.   SO didn't mind crepes. It's balled up crepes flooded with a cream and cheese sauce that reminds me of Olive Garden. I only tasted the sauce and it's pretty heavy.  My chicken sandwich was incredibly dry. It was supposed to have artichokes, pesto, sun fried tomatoes. It came and you can only discern red colored chicken since everything was mixed. I managed 4 bites and could not go on. A very small plus was the side salad with radicchio was delicious. I finished that.     Pretty pricey but I guess it's more for the organicness of it. It's a bit pretentious, I feel (iced tea in a small wine glass)! You will see a lot of gals in their summer dresses dining here.   To finish up this nice brunch was the lady server said she would get our check and took yet another 15 mins to do so.   Also, we heard the lady tell a party she will not be able to seat 8 people but will make it work if they combine the patio tables outside. It's True. The seating is friendly towards 4 people max inside. Maybe 5 if you managed to grab a booth.   So I would try salads if you go here!",

I can't get over it! Baked nice and evenly. Top notch. This is a place where socialites sit and eat for 2 hours, so bring your red hat. Jk- u should probably call ahead though to avoid the tourists.",

The first server told us she didn't know if there was flour in their crepes. Shrugged her shoulders and didn't offer to ask. When I ordered the salmon I asked if it was farmed or wild and she looked at me like I had 2 heads. I asked her what was on it and she pointed at the menu and told me, exactly what it said on the menu. Once I got it there was a honey mustard sauce over it which IT DIDN'T say on the menu, turns out it was natural. I know because I am not on my way to the hospital right now. She's lucky. Our service after that was better. Except after I left the next server 30% tip, I asked her for a tea to go and she never came back with it. Poor attention to detail, my husband also got wrong directions to the restroom. Beautiful location, great valet and outdoor seating but I will take my $$ elsewhere in the future.",

The restaurant is known for it's natural cuisine, but sometimes it is not that tasty.  I will say that except for the chicken apple sausage, the french toast was okay, but it wouldn't hurt to have a small side of fresh creamery butter for it.  I would love to give more stars, but AF, you're going to have to earn them.  I will say the people in the Marketplace are much better in their customer service.  Do try the pastries in the Marketplace next door, the coconut and tuxedo cakes are to die for.  I would give the Marketplace 5 stars.",

Water is served in wine glasses, complimentary scone at the end of your meal, and the outdoor seating is pleasant.  I had their seasonal fruit plate (which seemed fresh and was not mostly grapes like some fruit plates), and baby spinach and tomato omelette with goat cheese instead of feta.  The tomatoes were sliced cherry tomatoes instead larger diced ones, and it came with (I'm assuming) fingerling potatoes with some sort of weird spice.  It was probably paprika, but I was too underwhelmed by the choice of potato to really look into it.  Fingerlings are good, but probably too fancy for breakfast.  That being said, it's still one of my favourite places for breakfast.  I haven't tried the market part of the establishment, so no reviews there.  Yet.",

So I have to call someone else to order the dessert and then I miss the coconut baby cake( which is the reason why I want to try this restaurant at first). They have sold out the coconut cake when I order even the table next to me ordered 4 coconut cake only 5minutes earlier. And the chocolate baby cake don't taste good at all.

Now onto the important part, the FOOD! I ordered the egg strata cobbler and their granola parfait to share with my daughter. Boy did I over order. The egg strata was just as described. The sausage was plentiful, with just enough cheese and it came out piping hot! The granola parfait was nice, a good way to balance the savoriness of the egg strata. I also tried a bite of my sister's strawberry and creme scone that she ordered, one of the best I've ever had. The one thing I wish was that they would offer an Afternoon Tea service. It definitely has the perfect ambiance for it and their regular food and baked goodies are already scrumptious!",

I've rarely had a bad meal here, but Saturday, the place hosted every old woman's birthday, baby shower, and all-around chick event. I think the kitchen panicked and started throwing shit on plates like monkeys were ruling the kitchen.  Anyway, it wasn't good. Come here when it's not so packed and you don't have to listen to the gay couple next to you bragging about their trip to Barbados and how they frolicked nude on the beach.

    "text": "SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE. A girlfriend of mine said she has been here before and the service was wonderful and the food was as well. So she decided to take me here for lunch for a great experience.  I gave them more than 3 chances to rectify the situation but they did nothing besides give me a Bellini on the house which I could have paid for my own, no problem. First, I ordered a warm brie with caramelized apple appetizer that they served me cold. The waiter indeed took the cold brie and served us a fresh one. But while we were waiting for the warm brie the food runner brought our entrees out and we informed her we still haven't had a chance to enjoy our appetizer and we simply weren't ready for out entree. The food runner had the nerve to ask us \" well what do you want me to do with the food then\", in a very ugly and agitated tone. Then she had the nerve to tell us she will set them aside until we are ready to have them. My friend then tells her well they will be cold by the time we finish our appetite and the food runner agains says well what am I suppose to do and you just ordered salad any way so it doesn't matter if I sit it aside or not. I actually ordered a grilled shrimp salad so I should have had hot fresh grilled shrimp. Which you would think it is her job to figure out what she is gonna do and not ask us how to fix the situation. So my friend very respectfully tells her that she will just have to make us fresh plates unfortunately because our appetizer was not served properly. The food runner rolls her eyes and literally stomps off with the food. I was livid at this point so when my waiter came back to the table I explained to him what had happened and he seems appalled about the situation and said he would talk to her because she should have automatically taken the food back when we told her we were still waiting on out appetizer and that it was common sense we would have fresh dishes prepared. So after the brie came out fresh and I honestly loved it. Actually an amazing appetizer when served properly.The same food runner comes back with our entree and when it comes out it had no dressing at all on it. So instead of trying to come off like I am trying to complain about it I ask her does this dish come with dressing or is it meant to be a dry salad. I asked only because it could be possible they serve it dry MAYBE. So she looks at my salad and clearly see there isn't a drop of dressing on it and sighs and says would you like me to bring you some dressing to put on it. By this time I felt like getting up and walking out but I relaxed and again explained to the waiter what happened with the same food runner he observed my salad and clearly said oh definitely there isn't dressing on it. I then apologize to the waiter because I don't like to be that complaining type customer and he said all the right things and took the salad to go put dressing on it which is what the food runner should have did instead of bringing me dressing to dress my own salad but I explained to the waiter I didn't even want the salad anymore and to forget it. He insisted he would make me something special to compensate for the horrible service I was receiving so I attempted to give him a third try to fix the problem.He then brings me the dish which I didn't get to enjoy because I was so upset from everything that happened I ended up no eating it. So when the bill comes I realized he didn't only charge me for the special dish he made to compensate for the horrible service but he charged me for the shrimp salad I never touched. I was in complete shock and I was so over the whole experience I just gave me friend the money to pay the bill and I walked out. I will definitely NEVER be going there again and if they know whats good for them they should fire that food runner because I'm sure with her attitude I'm not the first customer she has ran off.",

I figured this would be the best place to take them after reading these reviews. Welp, I was right!  I made reservations online through open table which made getting a seat not a problem. Very cute inside. Made me feel like I was having a tea party. I felt like I should have worn my sundress :)  The food was delicious. We all agreed. The only sad part about it was I didn't realize my salad would come already dressed for me. My friend got the avacado tower thingy, and the other one got the chinese chicken salad (looked amazing), and I got the vegetable chicken salad. I asked for a to-go box WHEN I ordered it, so I figured I didn't need to ask for the dressing on the side. Wrong. That's where a star comes off. Another downfall was shotty service. You ask for bread, and get it 20 minutes later. They're pretty slow at filling up drinks too. But we were so busy talking and ended up occupying the table for 4 hours, so I'll continue being a fan of them just for not kicking us out :)  We'll be back again when we want to run away from the boys.",

    "text": "so if i was grading this place solely on SERVICE it would get a NEGATIVE 10. the service here sucks. or maybe they hate asians? or anyone who isn't a rich white Scottsdale-ian? whatever, but i NEVER get good service here, i always get seated outside, in this hidden corner............. what the. i actually don't know why i keep coming back.  oh, yes i do. it's the chicken crepe. that is some good chicken. it's amazing. so that's how an awesome chicken crepe took a negative 10 to a positive 2 stars.  their baked goods, i do not recommend. mainly because our server recommended the red velvet cake to us, saying it was a best-seller, and how everyone loved it, blah blah blah... and it was THE WORST cake EVERRRRR. it was gross.  and actually... the only good things that i've had here are the chicken crepe and the cobb salad. everything else has been gross. the appetizers, the crab cakes, the soup.....  and back to the crap-ola service: i brought my mom and sister here for some fun \"girl time\".... and this was on a rainy/dreary day in december... and they would NOT seat us inside. the snot-faced girl at the front (she's always there and ALWAYS snotty, i totally forgot her name - i actually read her name tag JUST because i wanted to yelp her name....... bummer) said they were completely booked inside. which i dunno, it was pretty empty when we got there and still empty when we left. so whatever. so they seated us OUTSIDE. and then had the nerve to say that the heat lamps were probably not working. uh, great. so i had to beg them to TRY and turn on the heat lamps.   anyways, mom and sis were not impressed. we had a bad time. and now i will never be back. and i'm sure they won't care, because i'm probably not the clientele that they want. whatevs.",

    "text": "Okay, so we had a rather large party of 13 of us, we were seated in the back in a cottage just for us. They do not have a children's menu but were willing to accommodate our 5 children with chicken and cheese quesdillas, which they all loved.....The organic strawberry and chicken salad with organic lettuce was really good, I had to ask for a side of bread which they graciously bought and had to get a side of white vinegar due to an allergy which they were okay with..  Some of the appetizers like the brie and apple could be a bit bigger along with the cheese plate wish that was a bit bigger - these two plates were not big at all and only enough for maybe 3 people.  The hummus which everyone usually likes was not a hit since they put pieces of cucumbers and tomatoes in them, not sure why....The service could have been a little better, as our glasses and drinks were not filled enough or often...We only have one waitress who was trying her best, as before they need more wait staff...Everyone enjoyed their food, I was disappointed in the fact that there salmon is not wild caught, rather they use farm raised Atlantic Salmon, which I do not understand why especially if they are about healthy organic food, farm raised salmon is filled with bacteria, chemicals and pesticides and can make you really sick, if you are used to organic food...Overall pretty good meal, it did not fill us up...as the portions are on the small side.....overall nice meal with family for a special occasion.  We would like to try their breakfast sometime to compare it.",

    "text": "We came here to try their brunch, but unfortunately we got there a bit late and ended up having lunch there instead.   I ordered their crab cake entree, which came with 2 small crab cake lumps and the rest of the plate was a salad. From the menu description and the price they charged, I would have expected more/larger crab cakes. This entree felt more like an appetizer portion but they charged lunch price for it. Despite this, it was actually pretty good, although I wouldn't order it for a lunch entree again.   We were seated in their outdoors patio area. It would have been nice to enjoy a nice afternoon eating outdoors.  However, their patio was lined with large old trees hovering over most of the outdoor tables. In addition, there were many birds swooping in and out of those trees.  We had to be careful both of falling leaves/debris and bird poop the whole time.",

    "text": "The food was good and fresh, but wasn't the most amazing thing I've had before. Most of the pastries we were hoping to try, they were out of which was one of the reasons we went there. When we tried to make a reservation for 11 people, they only allow a maximum of 4 people per reservation when making it online, and state that we should call if we have more people, the problem is that nobody ever answers the phone there. They have a voicemail mailbox for reservations which states that they will call back right away to confirm which they never did, and a general mailbox for anything else. So you literally can't get ahold of a real person when calling to make a reservation. So we made 3 separate reservations using Yelp under different names and put in the notes that it was for 11 people and that we did it this way because nobody called us back. Also, a few of us asked for Diet Coke which is on the menu, but they brought a Coke Zero instead, which for one of us is fine, but not everyone likes the taste of Coke Zero. They should have told us that they didn't have Diet Coke up front.",

    "text": "Once again eating on the go in between meetings, so grabbed a pre-made sandwich from the Arcadia Farms Market counter across street from cafe.  The Turkey and Brie sandwich with Fig Jam sounded amazing and I was also tempted into one of the lemon bars from the case.  My mouth was watering in anticipation of what I was expecting to be a fabulous gourmet lunch in the middle of my hectic day...that is until I watched the friendly girl behind the counter pull my lemon bar with her bare hand!  Admittedly, I'm a bit of a germaphobe, so not trying to be overly dramatic here, but really?  I think tongs or even a piece of wax paper are appropriate; especially for this trendy, high-end establishment.  Changing money and then directly handling food is just gross.  My Turkey & Brie sandwich was ok, but next time I would ask for a side of the fig jam, as I could not taste it at all.  The Arcadia Farms experience fell short today, but I still plan to come back and dine with girlfriends in the Cafe.",

However, I found my strata cobbler (\"best thing on the menu\" according to the server) too heavy on cheese and too light on eggs. Same with the crepes - too much cheese feeling. Conclusion: if you like cheese, creme fresh, real whipped creme (all of which were also served in plenty quantities) don't miss this place!",

And they were out of raspberries for the \"Raspberry Salad. The poor wait staff where running around like chickens with there heads cut off. I will never go back.",

Great spot to grab a coffee and a pastry! We bought a full cake to have after lunch for my niece and nephews birthday.   I had the roasted vegetable salad and it was a pretty yummy. The sandwiches all looked very good. My husband said that his turkey club was very good, but nothing too special.  Great ambiance though. NIce size patio and cute decor inside.",
