I felt like we were on a vacation, the atmosphere was simply stunning, we sat outside under a tree and enjoyed every moment of our meal. We will all be coming back for sure!",

Well maybe your mommas but not mine... Wonder bread anyone? Def not! Someone tell me what they do to their raspberries because raspberries I buy never taste like that. Really appreciated the service and the coffee was freshly ground from an espresso machine. Menu looks killer. Will be back for dinner and a bottle of wine soon!!! Interior decor is clean, simple and elegant.",

    "text": "Wow. Went to dinner here last night for the first time since opening and I can honestly say it was magical. From the moment I walked in till I left, dish after dish, service, and atmosphere were top notch. I did not know that this was a newly opened restaurant. I walked in with my wife and immediately greeted by the Host named Rick who was very pleasant and sat us quickly with genuine care while carrying on a conversation. This was a sign of more great things to come is what I was thinking to myself.  Chris our server was awesome. He immediately greeted us and made us feel incredibly welcomed and we knew we were in good hands. After suggesting a few cocktails and various wines he then moved onto the dinner menu and suggested some great dishes along with paring to our wine of choice.  Once our order was placed, the Chef then came out to greet us. Chef Gio, the proprietor was warm and friendly offering his suggestions as well. He then made his way through the dining room making everyone feel like they were home.  From the first dish, we were in heaven. I would write what we had from course to course, but I think that's what makes this restaurant so great and what will make this one of the best you'll ever try is the fact that it continues to change its menu daily.  Anyway, from our first course through the main, it truly took us to a new heightened sense of taste ecstasy that I have not experienced here in the valley. Everything was cooked to perfection and the ingredients were of the freshest local and regional flavors that I have ever had in their combinations.  Dessert at the end was just the perfect conclusion to a much deserved night out.  The restaurant itself was quaint and tastefully done. It took both of us to a place of elegance yet a comfortable sense of being. Just perfect feel to it. I will be back and cannot wait to see what Chef Gio will concoct next. I am a believer in this culinary mirage in our fair city. Thanks to the team at Virtu'!",

Dessert was tasty too, but for a key lime type dessert (served in a cute little glass jar), but it was too warm and the texture was a bit slimy. All things considered, I would revisit next time I'm in town and would recommend to others.",

The staff was friendly and accomodated our every wish - from the fun and friendly banter with the bartenders to the great suggestions from our servers.  Chef Gio Osso and his kitchen was on point continuing to put out satisfying dish after dish and the bartenders great drinks.  We could not have asked for a more spetacular dinner.  Amoung the dishes we enjoyed included the crispy kale salad and sausage polpette followed by grilled aparagus, charred octopus accompaning our butterfish, and grilled pork rib chop dinners.  The peaches and cream panacotta and chocolate peanut butter cup deserts were fabulous finish out our meal.  Chef Osso and Virtu provided us with one of our best meals in Phoenix ever.  This hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale is definately not a place to overlook and one to experience.  We cannot wait to come back and explore the rest of their menu.",

For our entrees, we ordered the orato and the scallops . . . both an excellent choice.  The blending of tastes and textures in everything we ordered was beyond comparison.

Chris was our server and Geo is the chef.  They fly in scallops that are alive in the shell.  They taste completely different than typical scallops you would order at other restaurants.  Very fresh and flavorful with a nice presentation.  Actually had two of those.  The octopus app was outstanding.  Never had octopus that was that tender.  The papardelle and elk entrees were unbelievable as well.  Everything had a beautiful presentation but most importantly tasted great.  Can't remember the name of the dessert but it was basically vanilla ice cream in a coffee cup with espresso poured over the top.  Interesting, really liked it.  Had a couple of glasses of wine to boot.  It's a cool little place with a nice, yet casual, atmosphere.  It will definitely be incorporated into our rounds of typical places we frequent.  We will be back.",

This is a pricey place that touts itself as \"fit for foodies.\"  Not this time.  My burrata appetizer was the best thing I had, although it did come with a strange parmesan cookie - literally a cookie, not a cracker,  with the consistency of a Lorna Doone.  My entire entree was underwhelming:  the pork chop was a bit overdone, very tough and the flavor was ok.  The broccoli underneath was stringy and flavorless.  My husband's steak was also very tough.  The bread pudding dessert was dry, dry, dry.  Maybe this was an off night for the cook staff, but there are so many better downtown Scottsdale restaurants at this price point that Virtu is now at the bottom of my list.",

I was ahead of her in a very tight space. The water that was on the table tasted terrible. If you live in AZ you are more then aware of how terrible our tap water is. I asked the waitress if it was filtered. She said it was, I told her it tasted awful. She said the only other water they had was sparkling. I told her I don't care for sparkling water. Her response was rude, she threw her hands up and said well that's the only thing they have and walked away. While taking my friends drink order she cracked her knuckles. Not very classy for a nice restaurant. We sat for 15 minutes didn't see her again or receive our drinks. Would have liked to have tasted the food but we were so upset about the terrible service we got up and left. Instead we took our business to another restaurant in Scottsdale. An upscale restaurant should be a total experience, they can't just count on the food to keep people returning, service is very important. I won't be giving this place another try.",

My husband had the frittata; he said the sausage in it was superb.  Even though we were stuffed, we waited a bit so we could try dessert.  The butterscotch budino was amazing.

    "text": "We are not negative people and we really enjoy dining. I have to admit I don't understand what everybody is raving about!!!  Let's start with the outside dining, so raved about. Sitting outside, wow, not charming, no misters, 90 at night.  But we came for the food and the rave reviews, right? And as the server pointed out as we sat down, this restaurant was one the Top 25 new restaurants in America from Esquire magazine! But wait, that was when they opened more than five years ago apparently as I later discovered (and I never before heard that Esquire Magazine is the standard for fine dining . . .  Fast forward to the MEAL The server kept pushing and pushing us to order. He said he wanted to keep the kitchen going and not delay our meal. It was 6 PM, restaurant not busy yet but anyway.   And be prepared, the menu is NOT what you see online. they have four or five \"small plates\", and then two pasta dishes, and then for the main course they have five or so items. The menu changes the server told us every day. OK, nice concept. But the menu that we were presented was woefully short of choices and interest for all four of us except for one fish entree.  The reviews you will read and on their website rave about the octopus \"small plate\". Well, I consider myself an expert in seafood having eaten it all my life and living in places where fresh seafood is steps away.  Honestly it was one of the most boring, bland presentations of octopus that I have ever had. And I'm being nice. It was so mediocre that I struggle to understand the other opinions of how special it is.  My partner had the hockey tuna, small plate. Emphasis on SMALL PLATE at $17. Fresh Augie, incredibly small quantity.  So then I finally understood what they are trying to get you to do. They want everyone to order a small plate which is a fancy word for appetizer, but the appetizers are $17-$20 alone. Then they want you to split a pasta dish of which there were only two. Let me now get to the pasta. Of the two specials we chose the highly recommended by our waiter pasta, egg, and tomato dish.  UGH .... again I'm sorry to have to say this but it was awful, had a very strange flavor, was not appealing or appetizing. We tried to share it but took about two bites each and said that was enough. $25 or so was the charge.  The two of us decided not to continue ordering any more food from the menu because we were so disappointed. Our couple partners who joined us decided to split the swordfish which was a special of the day. This was the only bright spot in the entire evening and meal. It was very very good. We had a taste.  And then back to our server. You'll notice that some of the reviews say that the waitstaff pushed and pushed people. Well our waiter did the same. He constantly pushed us and it made for a very rushed feeling uncomfortable dining experience. Clearly they wanted to turn the table.  Summary -summary overpriced, not charming at all, not comfortable outside seating, and except for one item on the menu, everything else a huge disappointment. I'm very forgiving but I would never go back and I recommend you pass on this one. It may have been good when it opened five or six years ago but no more. Sorry, I wanted to be impressed but wasn't ...",

Upon arriving the hostess was less then welcoming.  As we waited for her to clean our table we went to the bar to order a drink while we waited.   The bartenders were slow to attend to our arrival considering how small the bar is. Once we received our drinks we noticed our table was now set and the hostess was less than interested in seeing us seated so we sat ourselves.   The dining room is small, cozy BUT it was filled with smoke with the smoke detectors blaring. A pregnant  women was fanning herself and asked for the doors to be open for fresh air. There was no apologies of any kind and no resolve.    The menu was small in choice but creative. They are less than accommodating for any food allergy or adjustments to the menu and this is noted politely in small font at the bottom of the menu. Both my husband and I are gluten and lactose so our choices were few and far between. We both ordered the octopus for our starter and it was by far the best octopus we have tasted. The scallop dish was tasty but too salty for my tastebuds and the duck was tasty but unfulfilling. The prices for the mains were not worth it.   Now for the wine. Their website prided themselves on their wine list but choices by the glass are minimal at best. We were sadly unimpressed.   The saviour of the night was our server Taylor. She was extremely informative, pleasant and helpful.    Unfortunately our next visit to Arizona will not have this restaurant on our visitation list.",

My wife's and my last visit Ivan was our server.  Like all the servers he is great.  I could go on about all the food items like the Charred Octopus (called Polpo on the menu), the Buratta, or the Pork Rib Chop...but I would be saying much the same as all the other 5-star posters (sans the recent east coast moaning, which sounded like a difficult to satisfy perpetual pouty-puss to me or someone who prefers chain-food...do us a favor and stay home).  PS: Ivan informed us Virtu will be expanding/enhancing their outside dining area in addition to some new things for their associated bed and breakfast called The Bespoke Inn.",

    "text": "Virtu is a small American restaurant that offers an intimate dining experience. The interior seats around twenty people. Let's see what the fire marshal says. I came with colleagues, but it felt like I should have brought a date.   Virtu has an semi-open kitchen (no idea if that's official terminology). I guess that doesn't tell you much (Waffle House has a very open kitchen, right?), but given how pricey Virtu is, you can begin to imagine the chef, server, patron dynamic.   The kale salad came with too much dressing. I hate to put it this way, but if you look at the picture, you'll see that the dressing resembled your seven year old nephew applying chocolate syrup to a bowl of ice cream.   The menu didn't have any vegetarian entrees, but the chef was willing to whip up a quinoa and Brussels sprout dish. It was artfully presented, and had hints of pickled vegetables that worked surprisingly well. If I return, I'll have to show them the picture and let them know they have a winner.   I'd return for a special occasion or if invited. In the meantime, I'll make sure \"allows you to regularly eat at classy establishments without feeling uncomfortable social pressure\" falls on the pro side of the pro-con list of having a significant other.",

Salad was perfect, tender spinach, grape dressing, dried figs and cheese...fruity, slightly sweet, nice fig chew and tangy cheese.  The crepe was thin, tender, with prosciutto ham, Swiss and topped with delicate bechamel.  While grilled octopus had a flavorful bite, it was just a little overcooked along edges, but just right in larger pieces.  Accompanying chickpeas were addictive and spicy.  The Nebbiolo Rose was a revelation...perfect for a hot day with lots of fruit and a floral nose.  The crowning glory was the chocolate toffee cake and ice cream dessert  topped with a candle and complemented with cappuccino..  We devoured it and agreed that it was one of the best desserts we have ever had!.",

On our last visit, the waiter was condensing in up-selling, almost lecturing us on \"what most people order.\" The funniest thing is the restaurant tables are not large enough to accommodate sharing dishes.  The menu has always been limited, but has shifted to the exotic (rabbit? quail?) and extreme (40 oz steak for two people...most restaurants in Scottsdale offer an 8 or 10 oz filet...Virtu sells 20 oz per person!). Until recently, Virtu had no real salad selection on their menu and NO vegetable options.  On the positive, the quality of the food we ordered was just as good as in the past. Unfortunately, the \"new\" attitude detracted tremendously and we won't return. I think the celebrity of a James Beard nomination has gone to everyone's head at Virtu. Very sad!",

We had the roasted peppers ( WOW) , the ricotta salata and the tortilla( Spanish style).  The tempura white anchovies were fabulous. Later we stayed for dinner and had the octopus salad and arugula and berries salad. Each dish was prepared with the highest quality ingredients. We had a vegetarian in the group and they prepared a beautiful pasta for her since there's not a lot of vegetarian options for entrees.

Pork chops can be tricky often dry and not tender.  This chop was spot on juicy, tender and very flavorful. Highly recommend Virtu",

The atmosphere was comfortable, the staff was very friendly, and the food was spot on :) I can't want to go back and try the dinner menu. Although everything we tried today rocked ..leaving room for the chocolate bite dessert was well worth it! I'll be recommending this place to all my friends for sure.  UPDATE: Today I went back for my third visit. They were serving a brunch menu that was out of this world. I love that the menu is so dynamic ...and that they've left a couple of favorites like the Starter Kit cocktail on the menu as a terrific way to begin any meal. I can't wait for my next visit!",

I was drinking heavily throughout the day and during dinner so I don't remember everything I had, but the things that stood out to me were the scallops and both pastas. I only had one of the scallops because we split everything, but it was seriously one of the best I've ever had. Everyone in my family agreed. The pasta reminded me of the handmade pastas I had in Italy last year. They were really yummy. My favorite of the two was pesto based.",

Friendly,  knowledgeable about the menu, different drinks, gave us info on Scottsdale, and he was equally engaging with us while working. We had the Budino and Sticky Toffee cake. Wow! The cake was spectacular, so moist and delicious in flavor. Order this! We sipped on Limoncello & Frangellico with our desserts, and just enjoyed the nice atmosphere of the restaurant. A really nice find on Yelp for us, just wish we had come back for a full dinner service. But we loved this experience, and appreciated the great service by Jeremy.

It didn't spark in my mouth.  But I really like the flavor of Anatra, smoked duck breast.  Go for the gusto for desserts.  We had the butterscotch pudding and the chocolate sticky cake.  One was light and pleasant, one was rich and heavy.  But both were excellent.  When you alternately eating both, they complement each other.",

    "text": "Virtu is located in Scottdale's Old Town.  Intimate little restaurant with patio seating with large umbrellas and heat lamps that will warm your back.  Those umbrellas were actually needed since out of the 330 sunny days per year in Arizona, tonight happened to be a rainy one!  We saw three poor waiters take turns hold an umbrella for a large party across from us until they jury-rigged a temporary cover.  Now that's service!  As for the cuisine, the limited menu has some pretty high-quality eats with more hits than misses:  * They have a pretty sizable cocktail menu. I got the Fortified Truth which has like 5-6 components but I mostly tasted grapefruit juice and cinnamon.    * The Spanish Octopus with garbanzo beans is their signature dish and was incredibly tender and smokey.  Seasoning was good, just a tad bit saltier that I would have liked.  * Insalata was a minor letdown.  Too much arugula and not enough walnuts or goat cheese.  The octopus dish also comes with arugula so I regretted not getting a different app.  * Scallops with Brussels Sprouts, Chamomile Beurre Blanc, and chestnut puree was a solid dish.  Light, perfectly seasoned.  * Muscovy Duck cooked medium rare was juicy and tender.  The crust was smoky, but was on the saltier side for me.  Either that or the butternut hash with chorizo was over-seasoned.  Maybe you need to drink lots of wine to properly enjoy this dish.  The quince jelly helps add some needed sweetness.  * Sticky Toffee with Salted Caramel Gelato was an excellent dessert - not overly sweet, and nice balance of drier texture from the toffee mixed with the gelato and the sauce at the bottom of the plate.  Great with black coffee!  Solid 4-star restaurant.",

The menu is small but everything I've ever had there was good so it's plenty of choices. The polpo (octopus) is one of their best known dishes. I'm normally hesitant to try octopus because of the texture, but this is delicious! The pastas are made in house. Basically you can't go wrong with your choices. For dessert the chocolate cake is divine! Virtu is definitely on our go to list of restaurants in the valley!",

We had the pappardelle and bucatini pastas which were both amazing. The pappardelle was savory and salty with a great rustic style. The bucatini was spicy and delicious as well. For desserts, the chocolate chip gelato tasted fresh. The chocolate cake dessert was so delicious with a soft, warm center topped with fresh gelato.

Everything was PERFECT. We then finished with affogato, blood orange gelato, espresso, and a latte. I can't imagine a more perfect brunch. The service was also phenomenal! Now I definitely see what all the hype is about this place.",

The service is absolutely exceptional as well, and I'm a very big critic when it comes to service. Very well trained staff all around. The servers knowledge of the food is a quite obvious reflection of how much this place cares about its ingredients. On of the top places in Phoenix to take a first date. Hands down. Absolutely beautiful patio, upscale without being pretentious. Can't say enough good things.",

The service was excellent and our waiter was very knowledgeable (he was also a Sommelier, but we are beer drinkers so didn't take advantage). We had the Pompo (octopus) appetizer which we were told was a must try. Very delicious! Our group tried both pastas, which were tasty as well. The gnocchi is flavored with blackberry, which I had never seen before. The highlight of the night was definitely the sticky toffee bread pudding - save room for dessert!",

Had the hen pate to start, not gamey, not as rich (in a good way) as chicken liver pate, great additions with the plums and mustard.  Then the gnocchi, spiced with pumpkin,  light duck confit, solid.  We then had the sea bream, perfect crispy skin, loved it. Also,  the local farm hen, perfect cook. Solid all around,  pricey for its portions,  but that's fine for being in phoenix area.",

    "text": "I now see why this restaurant has so many awesome reviews and is highly ranked. This was only my second time dining in Scottsdale, but I can't help feeling every other place will be a let down.   Location is a little off-beat, so if you are looking to people watch or watch the cars drive-by while you eat outside you'll be disappointed. Upside, it makes for a perfect and pleasant spot for a quiet night out for dining.   We dined on a very cool evening and were concerned an outside table would not be a good option, but the hostess assured us the space heaters would suffice and she was very correct. Heaters at every table and we asked to have ours knocked down a bit after the wind died off.    Do beware, as I've seen a few reviews related, majority of their seating is outdoors. If you do have a reservation, plan on most likely sitting outside, and if you hit one of those few AZ rainy evenings, be prepared to have a call concerning cancellation. We lucked out, night before was a killer storm. Server stated they had to cancel a ton of reservations. That aside, DO eat outside, the inside seemed a bit noisy once the place was full while the patio remained a much better place to hold a conversation.   Staff... very professional, but at the same time quite friendly. Nathan our server took a lot of time with the menu and was very knowledgeable when my wife's vegan questions came into play. When asked about wine suggestions, didn't jump to the ridiculous price section and suggested a few that went well with some of the main dishes we were thinking. Even got a few jokes in there when the gelato fell off the top of the chocolate cake (which they were seriously willing to redo).   Food... superb. Starters are sizable enough where we could have probably done 2 for a table of 4, but we all wanted something different so went for it. Preparation and seasoning spot on from start to finish. Accommodating to my vegan wife (almost dessert still gets her), beyond the usual pasta and veg option. I did a Buratta starter and Short Rib main. Both excellent, the Short Ribs were like butter. The brussel sprouts, which I'm not the biggest fan, I killed and had to ask about the preparation so I could try to reproduce at home.   Wife had the sticky toffee cake, and OMG, GET IT!!! I wish I could type 4 letter words to say how good that was. Only other dessert I will remember more is our wedding cake.   Definitely return.",

    "text": "Virtu has been on my radar since it opened, and I decided to finally bite the bullet and shell out some big (but not big as usual, thank you Restaurant Week!) bucks for dinner last weekend. It was. so. worth. it.  We had a 7:00 p.m. reservation on Saturday and arrived a few minutes early. We passed the time at the bar and I ordered a glass of wine. Bartender followed us out holding my drink to help us navigate to our patio seat. It's little above-and-beyond gestures like this that separate the rookies from the pros, people.  We lucked out with the mid-May weather this evening: GORGEOUS. The quaint background of Bespoke's courtyard and twinkle lights that created the most amazing early-summer atmosphere. As the sun went down, I decided wanted to move in and never leave.  Onto the important stuff: DINNER. Our server Stacey (I think that's her name!) was so friendly and helpful. Our restaurant week choices were:  -Simple salad for me: fresh arugula, sliced peaches, radish, crushed hazelnuts and a parmesan vinaigrette. Lots of textures intertwining here. A perfectly balanced and refreshing start to my meal.  -Sausage polpette for him: 3 sausage meatballs tossed in an AMAZING red sauce that seemed like it had been simmering all day, accompanied with a dollop of ricotta and grilled crostini. Fiance: \"I just want to eat a gigantic bowl of this.\"   -Brown butter gnudi for me: Oh my sweet weeping infant mercy soul. Ricotta pillows sauteed in brown butter, tossed with English peas and mushrooms, some more of those crushed hazelnuts and topped with shaved pecorino. This. Was. Life. Affirming. I ate the entire bowl. I do not regret.  -Grilled pork rib chop for him: I was told this was the best pork in the history of mankind. It came with roasted carrots/asparagus and was served on top of a rosemary/goat cheese fondue. I KNOW!!! A gentleman sitting next to us spied the chop and immediately declared his order the same. A good game-time-decision, sir!  ...and onto DESSERT. We shared the strawberry olive oil cake (the most amazing, summery, juicy strawberries you have ever eaten, accompanied by pistachios and vanilla whipped cream draped over a perfect, not too sweet cake), and the chocolate peanut butter cup, which was basically out of control. A small, RICH portion of peanut butter mousse layered with chocolate mousse layered with crunchy chocolatey toffee. Two words: TO DIE.   So yes, Virtu is basically perfection. If I had a larger bank account, we would have much more frequent meals here. It is now my \"special events\" dinner default. There is no other choice.",

The stand out appetizer was the charred octopus w/ calabrian chile butter although the grilled asparagus with duck egg, candied bacon and foie gras hollandaise was nothing to dismiss.   For entrees, we had the spaghettini (from the pasta menu), the scallops (with white chocolate beurre blanc), the pork rib chop and I personally ordered the marsala braised short ribs with Brussels sprouts, hazelnuts, currants and vanilla sweet potatoes. Go with friends because you are going to want to try EVERYTHING. You'll be happy you did because everything was amazing. My short ribs were flavorful and were so tender, the meat VIRTU-ally melted right off the bone.   For wine, I ordered the Coto de Hayas Garnacha...a few times. When it's my time to go, I think drowning in that celestial chocolaty wine aroma is definitely on my short list of ways to die. *I can't remember the name of my cocktail, it had blueberries, shaved lemon zest, whiskey and some other delightful flavors in it and I think I'll go back just to ask them how to make it at home.   The only thing I was unhappy with was their designated parking lot across the street. They really should have some lights over there because high heels, unlevel surfaces, wine/cocktails and dark walkways are not a pleasant combination. Luckily, their food and drinks are so good that it may be worth breaking an ankle.  *I have just been informed that my cocktail was named \"Fortified Truth\".",

All of the food was delightful to look at and to taste. The shared salad came plated on two plates - easy to enjoy with plenty of goat cheese for both.   Overall, the service was attentive without being overly so. The food was great - highly recommend the octopus! Looking forward to another trip to this restaurant, perhaps for lunch.",

Apparently they \"threw out\" thier tequila and did not have any so I could not try the margarita.  We sit inside & enjoy a glass of wine each. Lambrusco for me and barbera for my friend.  Her wine is leathery and very bold and my Lambrusco is light and sparkling.  Starting with the pumpkin risotto- our server says the chef is a \"risoto snob\" so it's quite good.  Love the confidence and the dish!  Chorizo and shaved cheese on top make it an easy a+. The temperature was perfect which enhanced the dish for me.  We also share the beet salad.  This is a lovely presentation of scattered radishes, berries, dressing, and homemade crackers with a goat cheese circle in the middle.  This is an accent dish moreso than a filling entree salad.  We shared the halibut cheeks which are basically a fish & chips style with battered asparagus, pickle, carrots, hot pepper, and of course the fish.  This also comes with a garlic vinegar sauce, white ranch style dipping sauce and a piquillo pepper sauce.  Normally I avoid anything fried but this was Delish!  The dessert was the Nutella bundito- though the server recommended the toffee pudding we wanted this or the olive oil cake.  Sooo happy we choose the Nutella dessert- our favorite dish of the evening.  We loved the sea salt and caramel drizzle and the sea salt and whip on the gooey Nutella yumminess.  Really appreciated the great homey service and inspired cuisine.  Will return with a reservation on the lovely patio!",

    "text": "Bad service with great food?!  Well let me first highlight the service, we got this server Mateo, and I think he needs more training.  I will highlight which I think is the negative for this review of this server:  1. We did not feel welcome, coming in to this place - Did not even say \"Welcome to Virtu\" or something like that.  All he said \"So anything to drink?\".  Didn't even asks if it was our first time or not... I got a better welcoming service from Village Inn. 2. Does not know the menu.  My wife asked him for some recommendation, and he said \"Pretty much everything here is good..\" While that maybe the truth, as a server you got to at least try to recommend some of the food or any special about the food (did not even mention anything if there are any special food in the menu) that the chef offers.  No clue. 3. My wife did not like the tea (something wrong with the taste), so we asked him if we could return the tea and get coffee instead.  He did not even bother to ask what was wrong with the tea and just said \"sure\".  I mean, at least asks us why?!  Did not care at all. 4.  When we got our drinks, it took forever for him to get our order.  I watched him just talking to the other waiters and did not even acknowledged us if we are ready to order. 5. When we finally got our food, (someone else gave us the food by the way), not once he came over and asks us how we were doing.  The only time we saw him is to gave us the check.  Terrible service...I would probably stay away from this server.  You've been warned!!!  And now for the food...we ordered French Toast and it was very delicious.  I can say that the grilled squid was excellent.  My wife had the Pork Ragu and that was very delicious too.  if it wasn't for the excellent food, we would have probably not enjoy the experience.  But sometimes a bad service, even if you have great food, you leave the place with a bad taste in your mouth (like a bad after taste).",

    "text": "I would not recommend Virtu.  With so many options for dinner in Phoenix I find it difficult to give any good review of the food or service.  I have been to Virtu for Brunch with girlfriends and the food was good.  My husband and I decided to go for dinner on a Tuesday and were excited about a great meal.  We were promptly seated at our table, which the venue is fantastic, but waited for some time and had to ask a passing server if we could order a drink.  We ordered a bottle of wine and a beer.  Our server briefly discussed the food and provided a \"taste\" of the wine and walked away.  There was definitely a feeling of our server being either over committed to tables or just didn't care about a two top.  Our server walked passed us on several occasions without paying any attention.  We ended up asking another server if they could take our order.  I think that is enough said about service.    We ordered the hen and the buccatini.  The hen was over cooked...burnt skin, tough to cut and the buccatini was dull in flavor and chewy...not al dente.  Our waiter never came to check on our meal until we had asked another server for the check.  He offered to comp our meal, but that wasn't our objective.  We wanted out.  Maybe 5 bites each and didn't want to try and redeem or eat for free.    For a restaurant that has such great reviews and a reputation for culinary achievements, I can not say that I would ever return.  There are far too many competing restaurants in a similar price point and ambiance to ever return.",

To note we did visit during restaurant week so the menu was a bit different than normal and even the server noted some of the dishes were a bit off. I would call the cuisine \"inventive\" meaning you really aren't sure if you will like the dish based on reading the menu- but you are typically pleasantly surprised and sometimes wowed. I was wowed by the octopus and the burratta.. the insalata was creative but missing something. My husband had the pork rib which was memorable and the ceviche which was just plain weird (even for regular ceviche eaters!). The dining experience is top notch.. so worthy of a visit.",

The waiter was professional and atmosphere was relaxed but very nice. We sat outside as the the weather allowed it. Our first choice was the grilled octopus with chickpeas, it was the bomb!! Very very good. Most think of octopus as chewy but the way this was prepared made it chewy and crunchy on the outside- not rubbery at all. I had the duck (I've never had duck before) served medium rare with caramelized brussel sprouts and blue cheese, every flavor complemented perfectly!! All of our meal was fabulous. Would go again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a pricey and delicious fine dining meal!",

    "text": "This was my top choice for Restaurant Week, and it turned out to be the right one. I came here for a girls night with reservations for 4. We were seated outside on the patio at the community table, which was surrounded by lanterns, strung lights, and trees, which made for a very relaxing ambiance. Our server George was very personable, and great at explaining how their drinks were handcrafted, as well as how the food was prepared.   I started off with the Fountain of Youth cocktail, the description of tequila, bell pepper syrup and siracha bitters peaked my curiosity. I asked the server about it, as I was a little apprehensive that I wouldn't like it, he said it I didn't like it I could just send it back. Well since there was no risk involved, I decided to go for it, and was glad I did. It was fantastic, slightly sweet with a minute undertone of the rooster sauce. One of the best cocktails I've ever had.  My friend and I decided to order different things from the prix fix menu and share so we could sample as much as possible. For the first course we ordered the Chef Starter which was a crostini with manchego, croquette, and roasted pepper, everything on the plate was enjoyable. We also ordered the salad with goat cheese, candied nuts, and beets, which was also fantastic. For our entrees we chose the flat iron steak which was cooked perfectly over a flavorful polenta, and the European seabass which had a sweet and savory sauce, both were amazing! Finally for dessert: chocolate mousse and marscapone ice cream. The chocolate mousse was very rich and fluffy and came with a chocolate truffle, and a fried donut, and the mascarpone ice cream was rich and delightful.   The only downside to our meal was that everything was served at a very slow pace. I was kind of expecting it since they were so busy, and it was restaurant week. Our server checked in with us many times to let us know what was going on, but it would've have been nicer if they were better prepared for the volume of customers. I will still definitely return without the restaurant week price, as the food, drinks, and service were awesome.",

All the flavors perfectly complimented each other. It is served with a nice arugula salad, which I threw into the sandwich as well. Will definitely get this again!   Pork ragu (over marscapone polenta, fried egg, salsa verde) - Exceptional, very hearty dish, tremendous flavors and beautifully presented. Top notch.   Can't wait to come back here!

    "text": "A certain hide-a-way restaurant, tucked inside the Bespoke Inn in Downtown Scottsdale, lives up to its name--Virtu. If excellent cooking is a fine art and the food possesses the quality of being rare, beautiful, or otherwise appealing to a connoisseur, then indeed this eatery is named appropriately.  I visited the Scottsdale restaurant twice since it opened. The first, a romantic dinner date, occurred a few months back. The noise overwhelmed us initially, but after a couple of Astral Tequila Blancos served with a side of Dante's Sangrita, we no longer had to speak loudly to hear each other. Instead, we whispered, feeling each other's soft breath and lips against the tip of our earlobes.  When we revisited the restaurant in May, we brought along another couple to experience the wonderful food and libations. I ordered a Kir Royale cocktail--champagne and creme de cassis in a flute glass. My consort and guests ordered a Dirty Martini with Kalamata olive juice. Our appetizers consisted of grilled octopus with arugula and lemon chick peas. They must have massaged the octopus for at least 40 minutes to obtain such delicate tenderness. The pork rillette (pate) with pickled fiddleheads and shimeji mushrooms tasted creamy and rustic. Plump juicy caper berries were used as a condiment complementing the dish. The third starter, grilled asparagus garnished with bacon candy, melted in our mouths and caused us to salivate like Pavlov's dogs.  We shared the pan seared branzino with calabrese peperonata and crispy leeks. We inhaled the light and flaky perfectly prepared fish along with the Italian sides. Our friends had the grilled flat iron with Moroccan spiced king oysters and the pan seared scallops with baby artichoke confit. At the completion of the meal, all was gone except a lingering aroma and four satisfied palettes.  We ordered the chevre cheesecake with nilla wafer crust and slices of Meyer lemon. This dessert started a spoon war between the four of us. We ended the meal with a glass of Bracchetto, a sweet and sparkling wine that tickles your tongue.  It isn't the main protein on the plate that I'm raving about, but the synergy of the combinations between the star and its supporting casts. Both the food and the service are trendy. The ambience, intimate and sexy, makes for a perfect setting for that special date.  I don't want to label this restaurant because that would create boundaries. It looks as though the edgy executive chef, Gio Osso, hovers around cuisines and dishes of the Mediterranean, including France, Spain, Italy, Greece and Morocco with a soupcon of Asian flourishes. I hope he continues to tweak the menu by creating new flavor profiles and tantalizing dishes.  I am the DinnerSlut.",

You will not be disappointed with the chistorra and eggs, as well as the refreshing Strawberry Fields non-alcoholic drink!   The location is beautifully decorated and quiet--despite the raging Scottsdale club scene being only a few blocks away.   Our waiter was very friendly and genuinely interested in making sure we had a great experience. He also recommended a great port for post-brunch drinks.",

That changed when I had dinner at Virtu last night.  Excellent food, service, and environment.  It's up there with some of the great restaurants I've been to around the world.  The space reminded me of downtown Palo Alto.  Cozy, not too loud, comfortable.  Especially on a late spring evening with its perfect weather.  Service was well balanced with just the right amount of attention and right level of information to allow our group to make wise food choices.  The food itself:  - The grilled octopus was excellent.  Nice and meaty, with a little bit of tang - The crispy pig ears were interesting.  Had a little bit of crunch, a little bit of chew, and a nice sweet flavor - The burrata was delicious.  Smooth and accented well with the sides - The asparagus was very nice.  Just enough bite and seasoned well - The giant tomahawk steak (shared by 3) was off the charts good.  I could immediately tell it was dry aged.  Just a rich cut of meat cooked exactly as requested (medium rare).  It just made me happy - The budino was smooth, rich, sweet and the perfect ending to a great meal  I'll be back.",

Wine list is Old World heavy and approachable with some west coast USA big hitters. I would have taken pics but food didn't sit around long enough and I'm not that socially awkward that I need the likes. Plus, a dinner like this, and you need to put your phone away for a couple hours.  An aside: a recent review inferred that being seated on the side near entrance was bad. Let me tell you, they can get busy and it's this cove of quiet where there's no way you'll know they have 120 other people sat. If you are typical Scottsdale and have to \"see and be seen\", then by all means, get seated in the middle of the chaos. Off on the side near the entrance felt like we owned the place.  Anyway. Third time I've been. Polpo (octopus is a must have). Spice level is a 3/10. Anything on their menu that is \"spicy\" is really just peppery. So don't be too leary. Ask the server their honest opinion. My mother who doesn't like spice, thought it a touch spicy but kept going back for more and loved it. Bucco D'Oro crudo was melty. Basically a Mediterranean sushi dish. Used Aji Amarillo peppers which are Peruvian cause the chef knows what works. Perfect spice level, you can actually taste the pepper itself. The lamb ragout pappardelle is out of sight. Arguably the star. You can't tell where the pasta leaves off and the lamb begins. The lamb is very special variety and melts in your mouth. Duck was ridiculous. Persimmon braised cherries (?) and a date and black sesame seed tahini. Browned Cippolini onions cause. Well. Onions. Little Savory, sweet, tart and rich. Tomahawk Ribeye. Just get it. Don't be scared. Chimichurri all over. Tons of Arugula salad with nice tart lemon. Perfect acidity to palette cleanse from all that marbling so you can go in for more. Finished with Toffee Cake, caramel and toffee ice cream. Perfect toasty, burnt caramel notes to go with coffee.   Only thing is I wish my fat a*% could have stuffed down more.  Don't come here to \"test if they're good\". Just go big. Get Matt or Robbie as a server. I think they're a couple, seems like they are...but that just means they're more sensitive to your needs and they won't hit on your girlfriend! Win-win!   These guys take their craft seriously. Passion. Knowledge. Integrity. Thanks fellas for another amazing dinner.",

We started off with a few cocktails/ I had the Ice Queen which the server recommended as one of the popular drinks with the ladies. I really liked it and gave me a good buzz.   Our server recommended we get additional dishes outside our 3 course meal for Restaurant Week as the portions are appetizer size so we started with the charred Octopus. It was delicious! For our first entrees, we for burrata and crudo. For our main dish, we ordered the duck and lamb. Everything was impeccable! Our entree though was definitely a good portion and we couldn't eat it all so we didn't need to add more to our 3 course meal like the server suggested. Our dessert was okay - nothing to rave about.   When we got our bill, it was on the expensive side so don't expect to be spending less than $75/person if you order alcoholic drinks. As the restaurant got more crowded, we barely saw our waiter. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner and would probably visit again!",

They lose another star because the owner chef is simply delusional, unprofessional and needs a public relations person to respond to all yelp messages. It's funny many dive bars to elegant 5 star restaurants get it right but you're too busy on Yelp.   Deeply offended when the Virtu in Scottsdale's wouldn't make one elimination from my meal. With only half a page of entree options, you're bound to have a change!   Frankly, had they branded themselves as a \"forced-menu\" restaurant we would have avoided, or when we made reservations if the hostesses would have notified us that they would not allow adults to personalize their meal, again we would have skipped it all together.  If I'm paying for what I hope to be a good meal, I should be allowed modifications especially if it's only a easy elimination(s) and NOT additions.   Actual Meal: * Had the chitarra pasta dish, which is over priced for the serving amount and is strongly encouraged by staff NOT to have as an entree but it's not listed as an appetizer nor is it a side... it was good minus the prosciutto crudo. I'd suggest making it a entree as a larger main dish with a better meat option  * Friends had (1) duck, (3) pork chops, as they stated it had potential but missed flavor and the table added basic salt and pepper to both  * Mixed drinks were probably best experience. Bartender/Mixologist was great to watch and drinks were tasty  * Service was snippy. Our waitress was not personable but she was like that with everyone  * They charge $4.00 FOR BREAD for the table. $4.00. Enough said.",

    "text": "It's great to update my review and report that Virtu remains one of the best (if not THE best) in Scottsdale! Truly fine dining on par with Los Angeles or New York, but with a charming, welcoming ambiance. No doubt a lot of that has to do with the fact that the chef/owner is on site and checks every plate that leaves the kitchen (at least he has been when we've dined there).   It's not cheap, but we've paid a lot more in Scottsdale for much lower quality. And, unlike many other places, Virtu strikes a perfect balance on portion size, so you can enjoy decent-sized appetizer, entree and dessert (plus wine...duh!) and not be totally stuffed when you leave...because you're really missing out here if you don't make it a full meal!  Quick tip to Chef...ditch the table candles, which put off a chemically scent and aren't needed for lighting. Oh, and please suggest that patrons simply shower, rather than dousing themselves in cologne -- older lady sitting nearby at the bar overpowered us with her scent and that does make it more difficult to enjoy the wonderful flavors of Virtu's fantastic food and wine.",

I had the veal chop, and my partner had the duck breast entree. For desert I had their chocolate sticky toffee pudding. I was blown away by the food. I had two sublime glasses of wine, and my server Matthew was great. I would come back if I didn't live in Vegas.",

My co-worker found the grilled octopus to be disappointing and below Talavera's (given his extensive time in Portugal I'm inclined to trust his judgment). My fish meal was not noticably better than Wildfish or Olive + Ivy.  Ambience is strange, sandwiched in a motel's courtyard. Service was indifferent and the meal dragged. Maybe that negatively influenced my view....   Relatedly, who is this Esquire critic?  CPH wasn't that great either...",

From our selections last night, we recommend the charred octopus- unlike typical preparations, this was amazingly sweet and tender; the grilled branzino with arugula, carmelized onions and a sauce so good, I don't know how they made it.   Smoked duck was prepared with home made hummus that made the dish.   The chef went above and beyond last night.  It was my friend's birthday  and we were treated to two special deserts.  One a sticky toffee pudding with foie gras that was one of the top 3 dishes I have ever experienced, in addition to a perfect chocolate souffle with carmel sauce. Reasonably priced for an extraordinary dining experience.  Friendly, knowlegeable staff.  Casual atmosphere with patio.  Will most definitely return.  Thank you, chef!",

They have delicious and unique cocktails - I had an earthy beet one at dinner and an orange one with egg whites at brunch that tasted like an Orange Julius. You must try something different off the cocktail menu.   At brunch, their crepes or a different take on a Benedict is a must have. The crepe is huge! We had one stuffed with ham and topped with a poached egg - heavenly! For dinner, the grilled octopus is incredible. Believe me, I was never going to eat octopus in my life. Until I saw this on a friend's plate and begged for a bite. Too many of the appetizers sounded good, so I just had 2 of those and no entree. The arincini were really good, but the asparagus with the poached egg, feta and candied bacon was literally the most delicious thing I have ever eaten!! The affogato was the perfect ending - not too heavy or overly sweet.  Okay, I gotta go get dressed and go back right now and try another cocktail and something else amazing off the ever changing menu...",

Seriously, this starter was amazing and I'm going to order it wherever they have it next time in the future!  Amazing!  I had the bucatini pasta which was ok but not a huge wow factor. The guys split a prime rib and my BF said it was the most amazing cut of Prime Rib he's ever had!  Seriously, it will feed a party of 3-4 people. Our friends have dined here before and said the menu changes frequently but they do keep favorites on there too.

Everything was prompt and all the dishes were explained very well.  The drink menu is nice, try the Margarita, made with chiles and awesomely spicy. The wine list is decent with some reasonable options.  Being restaurant week we were able to sample much of the menu. The burrata was a stand out as were the lamb polpettes. The flat iron Steak as an entree was amazing as was the pork chop was amazing fried in crispy polenta.  This was one of our favorite experiences for all the big \"friend dinners\" we have done.  The staff, ambience and food was just wonderful. Esquire Magazine rated Virtu as one of the top ten new restaurants in the country and it is not hard to see why.  Even with all that the prices are completely reasonable, especially for Scottsdale.  We simply loved it and will return soon!!",

The outside patio feels like a garden picnic while inside looks like an upscale French bistro. Service was top notch.  The food was flavorful and distinctive.  We started with the octopus which was tender and had a subtle spiciness that brought the bbq octopus flavors to the forefront. The scallops we're perfectly cooked on a bed chorizo and chickpeas that combined for a unique dish.  If you still have room for desert the sticky chocolate pudding with truffle caramel sauce is a must.  I will definitely have dinner again at Virtu next time I visit Scottsdale.",

We got there early and were blown away by the pretty courtyard with lovely lanterns and pleasing plants all over.  We sat at the bar waiting for our table and had the most interesting conversation about bitters and how to make them from scratch  with Dante- a charming bartender. I had their version of the old fashioned and hubby tried their Moroccan mojito. Both were just out of this world! After we were seated outside in the pretty courtyard, we decided to challenge the chef by sending word that we were vegetarians and we liked spicy food. Again, we were blown away. The burrata and spring salad had a major kick to it. And our main course- couscous and roasted vegetables bursting with flavors and textures left us quiet and in a trance for the rest of the dinner.  We are certainly coming back. Can't wait to exchange secret ingredient notes with Dante and challenge the talented chef all over again.",

    "text": "I came to visit my boyfriend for the weekend to celebrate our anniversary. He booked us reservations here and we were such pleasantly treated. However, there was construction going on when we went and finding the restaurant was a bit difficult with the limited street lights. Once we got inside, everything was all better! The hostess seated us and we had an amazing female server! She recommended a lot of the great dishes we had this evening and was super friendly. The decor is cute and cozy, with a cute touch to the silverware and napkins. I appreciate little things like that at restaurants. We even got a complimentary glass of champagne each because of our anniversary celebration. The meal was delicious and would love to return one day.  - Polpo: this octopus dish was so yum! The arugula on the side with the orangey sauce...even better! The octopus was soft and not chewy as you would usually get octopus as when grilled. The pieces were almost melt-in-your-mouth amazing!  - Oriecchie: best pigs' ears I have ever had in my life! They're like chips, super light and crunchy with a light sweet and sour flavor to it. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this dish. Definitely recommend! - Bucatini: not your usual spaghetti noodle, because these were hollow! Very chewy textured noodles that I really enjoyed with the sweet cherry tomatoes in the sauce and fried egg! Portion was perfect for the amount of dishes we ordered. Recommend to order too! - Maiale: they're known for their pork chop entree so I had to order. The pork chop was super filling and was cooked perfectly medium. The crisp on the outside and soft tender on the inside. I forced myself to finish the dish so I wouldn't waste, but it was too good to waste. The caramelized onions were also a good touch to it.  - Anatra: my boyfriend had the smoked duck with a side of veggies and that yummy taleggio phyllo!  - S'mores panna cotta: I forgot the original name, but this dessert was so yummy! The soft panna cotta with the bits of graham crackers and chocolate topped our evening off!   Definitely recommend :)",

    "text": "I wanted so much to love this restaurant. I received a gift card for Christmas from a friend who purported this to be his favorite spot. So my husband and I decided to celebrate my birthday with what we hoped would be an excellent meal before taking in the Vanessa Williams concert.   It started out fine: we arrived really early for our reservation and they still seated us, cheerfully - always a good sign.   The drink menu is clever, funny actually (my husband wanted to take pictures). I chose the Ice Queen, which was potent and beautifully fru-fru; my husband opted for beer, the Brooklyn Lager, about which he raved. The food menu is unique and well curated, with just enough options. Had the execution and service matched the menus we would have been thrilled. No such luck.  Although our server, Tatiana, was pleasant enough, she was super slow and very disorganized. More than five minutes to greet us, easily twenty minutes to receive our cocktails (worth the wait, but still, come on). After we received our drinks, I'm pretty sure she forgot about us until the table next to us was seated, then she finally took our dinner order.   We ordered the pate as an appetizer to share, my husband ordered the pork chops, and I decided on the scallops. The pate was DELICIOUS! So much so that my husband requested additional bread to finish it up. And that, I believe, was our undoing. Thirty minutes, and I wish I was exaggerating, to receive five pieces of crusty bread, for which they either held our order - or Tatiana forgot to turn it in.  We were prepared for a leisurely meal, but this was just irresponsible. I told my husband I thought something was up because our server was suddenly avoiding eye contact, even when she was serving our neighbors.  The entrees themselves proved to be as unbalanced as the service. My husband enjoyed his pork chops, indicating they were properly cooked, except at the bone - understandable. Conversely, my scallops were perfect texturally, but so salty as to be almost inedible. I was so hungry though, that I smothered them with the crispy lentils to absorb some of the salt, and gulped tons of water. Even at that, I was only able to eat two of the three.  To contrast the service we received, our neighbors, who arrived about thirty minutes after us, were finishing their dessert by the time we received our entrees. I, fortunately, had the foresight to request our check as soon as we received our entrees, otherwise we would have missed the beginning of the show. Interestingly, collecting the payment was Tatiana's timeliest act of the evening.  A couple of things: it was clear to everyone (our neighbors, the food runners and bus staff, our server) that there was a problem; however, no one stepped up to make it right. No correction. No manager intervention. Lots of eateries do well when things go smoothly, but the True measure of a really good restaurant is how they react when the wheels fall off. Good service can make up for a lot; poor service can negate a lot of good. This was a service fail.",

    "text": "\"Virtu Honest Craft,\" is a fantastic dining experience without being uncomfortably formal. The food is incredible; chef Gio Osso brilliantly combines traditional Italian/Mediterranean cuisine with contemporary techniques. The ambiance is extremely special too, with quiet volume and extremely personable, and friendly servers. If you're a fan of a lot of dishes with small serving sizes, then this place is right up your alley. I'd say that is my only warning: The serving sizes are rather... petite; however, that is my personal preference. Although the dishes are small, each packs a huge punch of interesting flavor combinations and a new taste with every bite. Without a doubt, the highlight of the meal was the \"Cioccolato,\" which was a sticky chocolate toffee cake with salted caramel gelato. The cake had a thick caramel-like shell, with a fluffy interior drowned in caramel sauce, all topped with a scoop of some of the finest salted caramel gelato. As amazing as that dish was, it brings me to my next point: The menu changes quite often. Akin to other one chef operations, chef Gio Osso likes to change his menu to bring different experiences for reoccurring guests. This is exciting for some guests, and disappointing for others. Fortunately, I am convinced the experience will be as good as the last, every single time.",

It was extremely dry and salty.  The presentation was nice but the place was so dimly lit it was really difficult to appreciate.  There were plenty of people serving but only two people that we could see who were cooking.  They should think about balancing that out a little more so that diners won't have to spend three hours to complete a two course dinner.  The last time I spent that long at dinner was at the French Laundry.  The only difference was that was a 10 course dinner.  I do remember another 3 hour dinner at Gary Danko's in San Francisco.  That turned out to feel like a 90 minute experience as none of us wanted that to end!  Also, there was no bread served to at least keep us occupied.  They did an excellent job of keeping our water glasses filled.  Seriiously, how can you keep diners waiting almost an hour after their orders have been placed and 45 minutes between the first and second course?  The server never offered an apology for the slow service.    Sorry, the food didn't make up for the poor service.",

We were a table of four guests the evening of 4/13/19. Our table was inside the small dining room where the tables are close together. For two hours my chair was being constantly bumped by every waiter, busser and food runner. Our waiter was efficient but not friendly or courteous, even a little patronizing. Serving staff leaning over guests to serve or clear plates is not becoming of the standard of food. The menu is small but I like that as every dish can be executed well. Our guests told me their Octopus appetizer was truly amazing. My Aparagus and my wife's Burrata were nothing special. Pork Chop, fabulous, Smoked Duck (waiters recommendation) was succulent and tasteful, Scallops, OK, Halibut, dry and tasteless. The Chocolate dessert was extremely good. Overall good food, fresh and interesting but the crammed inside table, pompous waiter and rushed timing ruined the total experience. $520 out the door for four guests is not an insignificant amount but what I had expected. The overall dining room experience did not meet my expectation and certainly did not match the quality of the food. We will probably return again in the future, maybe dining in the spacious outdoors hopefully with a more polished service.",

    "text": "We were in Scottsdale on business and asked a friend for a dinner suggestion. She mentioned Virtu so we made a reservation through Open Table. We were looking forward to a nice evening at the end of a busy week. Unfortunately, things went badly once we got there.  The outside area was inviting but there was no hostess/host to be found. A couple sitting near the entrance pointed us to the inside part of the restaurant. The hostess was nowhere to be found. We waited about 5 minutes and then she appeared. No apologies, fine, it was warm and she wanted to stay inside. She found our reservation and then in a panic told us our table needed to be checked. Eventually she seated us in the front where there was no one around. It was like being relegated to the bad kids table. Forget about the fact that the table was covered with leaves. When we asked her for another table she said \"there is no place else to seat you\" which was patently not True.  So, about the food: at best average. Grilled octopus was reasonable but nothing special. Pork chop with peaches was serviceable but lacked any wow factor. Mu buccatini was oily and had minimal flavor despite the multitude of ingredients.  Service was competent. Some might find being referred to as \"guys\" at a James Beard award winning restaurant off putting but by this point we were done. Too much hype, not enough substance. Pity because we have to come back for business and would have liked to have found something besides steakhouses and Mexican restaurants for our dinners. The only reason I am giving a 2 star instead of a 1 star was that I feel sorry for the wait staff.",

The restaurant is beautiful and perfectly Italian. Our waited, Matthew, was so friendly and amazing. He made the night so special. We ordered the fortified truth cocktail, and it was perfect. With the grapefruit and cinnamon combination, it was sweet but not too sweet. We were talked into the octopus appetizer because it's their specialty... It was great! I'm not into seafood like that, but it was definitely tasty and worth trying. My boyfriend finished the rest. I had the 5 cheese gnudi as my main course... Incredible! Soft, doughy, cheesy... Everything pasta should be. We had the white chocolate panacotta for dessert and that was perfect. It was too filling and the flavors were perfectly balanced. Everything is so fresh, and the menu changes daily. To top it off, our waiter gave us 2 free glasses of wine and free dessert! A wonderful night.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place more.  There were many positives and yet also some negatives that brought the experience down.  Overall, the food was very good and unique. I felt the portions could be bigger for what they gave you.  People in our party ordered the scallops and they said they were terrific but they only got 3 scallops (for $28) and finished their meal hungry. I got the pork chop which was a better-sized portion and also tasted good, but there was a fair amount of fat on the cut.   As others have mentioned on here, the service speed wasn't the best.  Sometimes it was prompt, other times it was slow. The major issue I had was after we ordered beer and wine mid-meal as it took over 15 minutes to receive. Our server kept on saying they were coming. When I approached the bar to speak with the manager to find out what the issue was, the bartender told me she was the manager in a condescending tone (unprovoked), and when I mentioned that we had been waiting a while, she pointed to the drinks at the bar and said \"they're right here\". No apology, no \"sorry, we're busy\", but I calmly asked asked a question and for whatever reason her response was in a unprofessional, unapologetic tone. To the server's credit, he took the blame and apologized. He also comp'ed us that round. It was just unfortunate to have that experience with the manager and the service delays as it soured what could have been a very good dining experience.",

I had never had octopus and what am delicious experience it was. It was grilled to be crispy and not chewy or fishy tasting at all. I was in heaven! Their grilled cheese is the BEST I have ever had in my 30 years of life. They top a thick crisp bread with a special cheese and fig jam. It will literally melt in your mouth; absolutely fantastic! Also, their iced tea has a unique taste which I loved. The outdoor seating is so adorable and peaceful. The staff is very friendly and provide excellent service.

Food and cocktail menus are constantly changing and evolving; the evening I was there I dined on ahi tuna tartare with | smoked onion mustard | garlic toast and then moved on to Smoked Duck with | cashew tabouleh | amarena cherry demi. I had a bite of a friends delectable dessert which was fresh grilled peaches and a delightful dollop of fresh cheese. NOW, on to the cocktails. Words fail to describe the unique and creative approach Spotty takes in creating his craft cocktails, and this is very evident in his beverage program at the bar inside Virtu Honest Craft. From the Mule Fresco w smoked rosemary & honey comb, to an inventive crisp Grappa cocktail w Cabernet syrup garnished w fresh red grapes...all served in appropriate respective glassware.  Make time to check out this gem, and bring your friends. Cheers!",

The waiter was very helpful in describing the dishes and encouraging one of our party in deciding which entree to order based on their preferences.   The octopus small plate was tasty but overcooked, a minor negative in the whole meal.  The asparagus small plate with the duck egg, bacon and feta was delicious.   My husband ordered the squid ink pasta with octopus.  Octopus was perfectly done with just the right amount of garlic and parmesan. I ordered the smoked duck with foie gras flan.  The duck was also perfectly done and the flan was incredible.  I was afraid it would be lacking the foie gras flavor but each bite was to die for!   The frites that came with it were very high in cinnamon which went well with the duck but was dry.  The rest of the plate was superlative.  The apricot gel that came with it complimented it perfectly. Our cocktails were excellent as was the Calabrian wine that we ordered.  Service was perfect! We look forward to eating here again.",

Perhaps my palate is not sophisticated enough for the tiny $17 appetizer of undercooked pasta or main course of lamb shank with pomegranate seeds.   I'll try them one more time... maybe it was just a bad night.",

We ended up waiting for a bit to get a table but again they were pretty busy and it was my fault not making a reservation before hand.   We spent the time waiting at the bar and had a few drinks, the bartender that was working that night was great. Had some great conversations and was really helpful in suggesting a few tasty drinks.  Once we were seated we decided to try their signature appetizer the octopus with Calabria chili butter.  And we were blown away! I can understand why that is what they are known for, because it was delicious to the last bite and almost had me licking the plate... but my wife wouldn't let me.  Our main dishes were Maiale which I order because the pork rib chop caught my eye.and she ordered Bucanti which I got a bite of and the goose egg was a nice touch. We enjoyed every bite!  Unfortunately we were both so full that we skipped dessert. But that just gives us another reason so go again to taste some of the options they ha e for that   All in all, it was a great night made special by the staff and Virtu. Highly recommend!",

We came with a group and ordered one of all the apps (loved the burratta) and we shared a bunch of entrees. Stand out we're the octopus and the brandzino.   The cocktails I had (something that tasted like an old fashion with a bit extra cherry) was so good I had to drink 4 of them.  Only downside at all was one plate that we sent back (the panzenella) because the bread in the dish was so hard it could have broken teeth. They replaced it quickly and it was delicious. Can't wait to go back to try the full menu.",

He was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I had the grilled asparagus appetizer and it was delicious with egg, feta and bacon candy.  My second dish was their signature grilled Spanish octopus.  This was presented beautifully and tasted wonderful.  The octopus was more tender than any I've ever eaten and seasoned perfectly.  I can't wait to come back for another meal and try their desserts.",

Flat out disappointing.  3) octopus- fantastic.  4) main dishes: duck/steak- I love culinary flavor, however, the flavor profiles were not prepared in a way that I would describe as life changing.

    "text": "No doubt about it, cocktails are the way to go at Virtu. The food, however, is overpriced and sometimes underwhelming.  We arrived to a jam-packed restaurant Tuesday night. I was a bit surprised because it looked like there were plenty of open tables when I made reservations online a couple days prior. I could tell right away that they were in the weeds because of Restaurant Week so I prepared myself for a slower dining experience. We were fine waiting at the bar for our table. We love craft cocktails, and we loved checking out all the obscure liquors and house-made concoctions behind the bar. My husband got the Nuova Bellezza, a grape-based drink, and I got the Fountain of Youth. His drink was very good, and mine was outstanding! I swear, you could get any tequila hater to enjoy this cocktail made with Don Julio reposado and yellow bell pepper syrup. We also had the classic Sazerac and their Starter Kit which was refreshing and slightly bitter.  My husband got the chef starters which was a crostini, blistered peppers and a croqueta. He didn't really like any of them and much preferred my salad. The salad with beets and goat cheese was nice, but the warm temperature indicated it probably sat at the window too long. I got the only vegetarian offering which was a modified (no pancetta) version of butternut squash ravioli. When my dish came to the table, I spotted the pancetta right away and sent it back. In the mean time, my husband got his thick pork chop but no silverware. I gave him my set while I waited, but he was still in need of a steak knife. My redone ravioli came out again fairly quickly, but I had to ask for another set silverware. I was very disappointed looking at the ravioli. The portion was minuscule! Four Chef Boyardee sized goat cheese ravioli with just a touch of brown butter and no butternut squash at all. The ravioli were very good, but thank god I don't have a huge appetite. Surprisingly, the star of my husband's dish wasn't the prosciutto wrapped pork but the phenomenal mushrooms on the side. The pork was moist but didn't have much flavor. My husband said he would have rather had just the mushrooms on top of a risotto.   We finished off with the affogato and chocolate course for dessert. My husband wasn't a fan of the affogato, but I liked both of them. His chocolate mousse was light and fluffy, and there was a delightful, warm chocolate s'more-like pastry on the side.  Our server was friendly, but she forgot about filling up our water glasses. I was also dismayed that the staff let the restroom run out of hand towels. Nothing like walking back to your table with wet hands.  I could see us returning again for pre-dinner cocktails, but we'll be sticking with FnB nearby for our food.",

The duck was cooked to perfection, we ordered medium as opposed to the recommended medium rare and it was delicious.

    "text": "Fantastic dinner.....again. Octopus was fabulous as it was the first time I had it. But the Buratta with almond honey might have taken the cake for the starter which says a lot because I crave the Octopus. The pork Saltimboca was flat out ridiculous. I really thought with a brine and then prosciutto wrap would make it too salty, but it was far from that. It was perfect didn't need anything. The potatoes were unique because They looked like fries sauteed with veg, but the crispy leeks on top added the slight crunchy texture that helped break up the richness of everything else in dish. I'm a huge eater I think they could've dialed back the veg and potato on the dish. My date had the Carbonara. I'm not a fan of it because it's really a romantic dish. Although the ingredients are simple, it's the chef's relationship with the product that makes it amazing. This was one of the most fantastic I've ever tried. Did I like it? No. But the execution was perfect. There was a small but of white wine and very little cream and the egg created layers over and over. It wasn't swimming in sauce and I love that. Again, it was the execution of the dish that made it great. I just don't like carbonara.  I wasn't excited about the dessert menu but daddy needs his sugar. The affogato was tremendous, but the olive oil shortcake was brilliant. They macerated the strawberries with a touch of brand but it was more complimentary than predominant. But the cake was so incredible and super functional. I could be served with anything.  My only complaint would be where we sat. We were sat on the patio right next to a table that got sat exactly at the same time as us. They complained about everything and we were subjected to listen to them complain openly about everything, then complain to the server, and when he offered to redo or get them something else, they'd refuse and then sit there and complain again. Keep in mind that we sat at 5:15 and there was nobody else around. I'm happy they are busy, but sitting us next to people simultaneously in an empty restaurant makes it tough to be able to really enjoy your company. We literally were sharing our dining experience with them and their attitude and pettiness was really annoying.  Next time,  if they sit us next to a table at the same time, I will ask to be sat elsewhere and if the say no again, I will probably leave. But I won't dock them for it because what they are doing is special, but they also need to keep in mind that absolute no opens themselves up to negative reactions.",

Great little place, lovely patio with heater lamps, terrific service & yes, everything else people are saying about the cocktails & food quality is not exaggerated. I decided to go the small plate route, thinking I'd order 2-3 appys instead of a main course to sample more things. But the portions were  quite large & two was plenty!  ( and I can eat!). I had the octopus ( charred to tasty perfection ) and the pork roulette (sp?) which was like a cold pate of sorts, with crostini & all sorts of interesting spreads & pickled yummies to add to it. I ended up dining alone this time, as my husband got stuck late at a conference. His loss! I was fully engrossed with my food, drink & the chatty staff for a good 2 hours & never even really noticed - LOL . Shhh! The place is really reasonably priced for the food quality, the wine list had many options under $12 & the like cocktails were tasty. Ask for patio seating if its a nice place. Highly recommend.

    "text": "I said I'd never, ever in a million years go back to Arizona, until Virtu. And, still, I'd only go back to dine and dash from the state as quickly as possible. Anyway, Virtu is incredible. We happened to stumble upon it during restaurant week. We ordered 2 of everything on the menu, and there wasn't one dish I wouldn't order again. It has a farm to table vibe; small, lite, quaint, and classy. We each ordered a crafted cocktail - I had the Ice Queen, which was great. Fruity. There was a Moscow Mule-esque drink that was fantastic. I think that my favorite dishes were the honey beets, there was a fish entree that was incredible, and the brandzino (unnnnnnnnnreal). I almost ready to book a flight back right now...",

It was a beautiful day, so we sat outside - unfortunately it got warm fast, so we moved inside.  Started with a Enza | Prosecco and a Apple cocktail from the drink list - which was perfectly made.  We ordered the berry parfait to start and it was okay - but, it was enough to share.  I ordered the frittate di pasta and they were kind enough to make it vegetarian, it came with a cup of fruit.  My cousin ordered the classic crepe and when it arrived, it was HUGE.  My other cousin ordered the smoked duck and she loved it!  So why only 3 stars?  I didn't enjoy my dish and my cousin didn't enjoy the crepe.  The skillet was pipping HOT, the food never cooled down, it just continued to release steam with each bite.  It was too bland and wouldn't order it again.  I left hunger unfortunately.  The crepe had a ton of ham, so if you like pork, this dish is for you.  Maybe dinner offers a better selection.",

    "text": "As other reviewers have said, the grilled octopus appetizer is very good. I also had the seared branzino entree and it was very good, too. Although the food was cooked well, the presentation of the dishes was a little bit over complicated for my taste. Every dish had a nest of a crispy fried garnish on it. I'm a little bit of a purist about quality ingredients like those used at Virtu; my philosophy is to \"Keep It Simple, Stupid\". The service, while knowledgable and accommodating, was quite slow; my dinner companions grew frustrated by the pace. I enjoy leisurely dining, though, so it was fine to me. The cocktails are definitely worth trying. I had a Let the Beet Drop and a Johnny Ringo's Epitaph, and both were unique and delicious. I'm torn here; while I definitely enjoyed my meal, I think I would have enjoyed simply grilled octopus and seared branzino even more at a number of different excellent Greek tavernas that I know.",

We tried the grilled octopus starter, the squid ink linguine with octopus and the smoked duck. We followed-up with a visit that included the two octopus dishes again. All were excellent. The linguine with red sauce and garlic was really good... A+. The signature octopus starter is good... but when compared to say the octopus at Mediterranean Explorations Company in Portland... it pales in comparison, and seems to try too hard. But why quibble? It's good. The desserts and cocktails have all been in the great category - with a grappa and grape cocktail on the front side, and a mascarpone ice cream with balsamic red figs to finish. On the latest visit both the cocktails and desserts were A+ again. Things developed slowly through the evening - any slower it would have been an issue. Highly recommended.",

On Wed night, sat at the bar and had some phenomenal cocktails while talking mixology with the very friendly and knowledgeable bartender. Each of the complex drinks was perfectly balanced and was made with fresh, high quality ingredients. We also had a wonderful dessert. The service was so comfortable and cordial..... so we returned for brunch Fri morning and WOW!!! The food was so creative, so well presented - and the flavors were simply amazing. We have eaten at many restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area over the years - but none can beat this place. A must go if you're a cocktail-loving foodie!!!",

We started with a gracious hello, competent and very friendly waitstaff, and a few beverages. Their cocktails are dynamite and the beer selection was very nice for a small-ish place. As recommended by our waitress, we started with the char-grilled octopus. Oh My Yum. This was tender, flavorful, and perfectly grilled. We loved the accompanying salad and dressing as well. My daughter had the lemon ricotta pancakes (delectably sweet and tasty). Her fiance had the grilled cheese sammy - great bread (Noble) that I would have again and again and again. Hubby had the pork dish with gooey egg on top - the best meal on the table! And I had the French Toast - again with Noble Bread and perfectly done. We splurged on the chocolate date cake afterwards, with a scoop of the sorbet. All in all - SO DAMN GOOD! I will be back for more.",

We have always had good service but our server tonight was rude and unfriendly ... whereas normally the food is amazing, tonight the food was a disappointment.  We ordered every appetizer on the menu... the octopus was overcooked And much too smoky, the rabbit gnocchi was blah, the marrow was over salted.. The salads were alright but the burrata was great.  As far as entrees the scallops were good (they always have been) but the fish was over salted and overdone.. the pork chop had good reviews from the men and was well cooked as was the steak.  Sadly it was the overall experience that ruined this restaurant for us... from the poor planning with reservations to the unfriendly service and finally mediocre food ...",

While I can appreciate the seasonal menu there was not a wide variety of dishes - I think there were about 6-7 main dishes with your standard beef, chicken, fish and pork with a slight variation in beef and one other chicken dish.   The appetizers were very good with my favorite being the burrata. Grilled octopus was good also. Highly recommend with a small group or a nice couples night out.  A little more on the expensive side so probably not a place you would frequent very often.  Overall great place - got 4 stars for variety of dishes",

It was a beautiful day and it certainly was nice to sit outside in their nice garden but the service and food were just okay. I must say my mother enjoyed the ricotta pancakes and the portion was just enough for her but if you're hungry the portion might be considered small especially at the price point of $12.00 for 2 medium sized pancakes. I ordered the grilled cheese with prosciutto and fig jam which was tasty but the prosciutto must have been mashed up in it because neither could you taste it or see it; I guess I was expecting thinly sliced strips of prosciutto for $13.00. The arugula and fennel salad was nice with a light dressing. My husband had chistorra (sausage) and eggs which he said was mostly potatoes for $14.00. The coffee wasn't bad since it wasn't bitter but it was weak. Our server seemed to have an attitude but he was prompt with making sure we refills on coffee and water without having to ask. Doubt we will return with so many other places in the valley to try.",

The first time I had the Amante Appasionato, super delicious drink, I don't remember what we had to eat because it was a while ago and most of their menu seems to change a bit.  This last time I had the scallops, they were perfectly cooked and the sauce with the bacon made for a scrumptious bite.  My husband had the charred octopus, this is one of their signature dishes and I can understand why.  This is the best octopus I've ever had.  It was not chewy at all, tender with a nice smoky taste, delicious.  I had a couple of cocktails, one was off the menu, a version of the Ice Queen but with gin instead of vodka, really great.  How could I forget to mention the dessert, oh my, this chocolate toffee cake with mascarpone ice cream was to die for.  I could have liked the plate.  The place is small inside, so if you want a table, better make reservations.  They have a nice patio, but on cold nights I think they keep it close.  I am a definite fan, I want to come sometime for brunch, the menu look",

The outside patio looked gorgeous with its romantic lighting draping over the surroundings. But it was a little hot outside so I stuck with a small table inside. I ordered a few items, even though I could have ordered the whole menu with my appetite. I started off with the octopus. Although its criminal with how little they give you, it was still delicious. The addition of chickpeas is a nice contrast in texture. The sauce is plate licking good.  The local spring salad was great but it wasn't anything that was amazing. Still, the goat cheese and prosciutto create a great french feel, with the cheese board and salad colliding into one The duck entree was worth the visit. The duck being moist and tender was only the tip of this voyage of a meal. The flavors were so orgasmic! The dancing juxtaposition of sweet and savory pair so well like two veteran tango dancers. The fresh ingredients only elevate the meal even further. Every bite was wonderful, and I purposely slowed down to enjoy every morsel. Im quite excited for what this place has to offer. I hope this place stays for quite some time.",

    "text": "Came early on a Wednesday evening. A lot of the seating is outside in a pleasant little courtyard with lots of flora and birds. The weather was pleasant, and I'm glad I could enjoy it -- the indoor area looks like it may have been a little limited/cramped.   Recommending most of the menu items might not make sense, as my understanding is that the menu changes frequently based on quality and availability. But if you get the chance to order the polpo, take it. The octopus is exceptionally tender and it's served with a sauce that is creamy and gently spicy -- the end result is like eating a shrimp cocktail mixed with a deviled egg. It was innovative, revelatory, and fun.   Staff is professional and knowledgeable. I wasn't shy about asking questions about dishes or wines, and I received quality guidance delivered graciously.   The dessert was a cioccolato, which is perhaps misleading. The cake tasted of toffee, and the ice cream of salted caramel. It was like eating a Rolo candy, but with the experience of having it as a chic little cake. I drank an Americano with it, which was well made and comparable to a higher-end coffee shop.  They seem to take their drink menu seriously, with an abundance of original concoctions written by an actual mixologist.   Overall a very pleasant experience -- they spend attention on everything that matters, and little on the things that don't.",

I should point out that there was no Yelp, Google or smartphones last time I was in town... Hell the www was in its infancy back then and nobody knew what to do with it yet come to think of it.   I started with the grilled octopus which was absolutely incredible, almost like eating butter (well the consistency, not like eating real butter as that would be gross)  Actually I started with a martini which was nice but I prefer the triangle shaped classes rather than the round rimmed glasses. I don't know why that always ruins a martini when it's served like that.  For my main I had the Manzo, Vermouth braised short rib with a glass of Malbec. It was fantastically prepared just the right portion size. Really well prepared and plated.   Was served by three waitstaff including an attentive  hostess who checked in a couple of times to see how things were. Not too much not too little.  All and all the great meal great service and I go back there if I had the opportunity again, but I'd bring my own Martini glass.",

Matthew went above and beyond to explain the menu and offer recommendations to us and really shared his appreciation of food with us.   It was our first time dining here and everything we ordered with the help of Matthew was amazing. The octopus, scallops, chicken, and salted Carmel toffee cake were out of this world.   The octopus wasn't chewy at all and are definitely a must.   The scallops practically melted in your mouth with how soft they were and the flavor palette was so satisfying.   The chicken had the best flavor and the toasted crispy kale on top was so delicious.   It was my fiance's birthday and we got a dessert on the House. The salted caramel gelato on top of the toffee chocolate cake was tasty and not too sweet. The sweetness level was perfectly balanced just like every other part of the meal.  I definitely recommend virtu for date nights or special occasions. You won't regret it",

Perfect for our celebration.  We were given a complimentary Prosecco and card from the kitchen in honor of our anniversary.  A very nice touch.    The staff is better than 5 stars and that is essential for a top notch review.  We started at the bar for a cocktail and the bartender was extremely informative and well versed in the specific area we were inquiring about.  He made us two (different) of some of the best martini's I've ever had.  His knowledge led us to try something outside of our box and we loved it!  Our server, Ivan was even better, if that is possible!  He knew every detail about the menu and was happy to steer us in a direction we wanted to go.  He was helpful throughout our evening at every turn and never imposing or pushy.  We loved our meal.  We shared 3 plates starting with an appetizer, which was their pulpo.  I have had pulpo, good and bad at many places and this ranked right on top with the best. Tender and succulent on a nicely complimentary sauce with just enough bite to tickle your senses. Our next dish was their pappardelle with mushrooms and white truffles (an add on).  This was yummy, but not my fav of the night and it was by far the most expensive (due to the truffle addition)  I felt it was served a bit dry for my liking.  Our next course was their scallops and they were fantastic!  Not over stuffing ourselves, left room for dessert and we had their pistachio gelato - unlike any variety you've had with True pistachio flavor and very creamy.  However, what took top billing for me, was their butterscotch budino.  Absolutely out of this world!  We thoroughly enjoyed their custom Italian coffee, robust and delightful, served cold.  A perfect ending to a perfect evening!",

    "text": "Virtu is probably one of the best foodie spots in Arizona that I have tried thus far. A little on the pricier side, but the quality food and service is totally worth the cost for this low-key upscale place. I came here for dinner on a Thursday night with a friend and we shared an appetizer, meal, dessert, and each had two cocktails. Everything was spectacular added with a side of exceptional customer service that can't be beat in this area of Scottsdale.  Service: Our waitress was incredible. She read out the whole menu in detail and gave us the specials, too. My friend who came with me is vegetarian so we asked her for vegetarian options, and right away she listed off the vegetarian substitutions for many of the favorites we were eyeing on the menu. They space out the drinks and food so you have enough time to digest and enjoy your evening. The staff does not rush you at all. I felt so welcomed and comfortable here.  Ambiance: So intimate and romantic! Small candles lit up a darkened room at night. If you want to take pictures of food, definitely sit outside because the lighting is better in the patio. I loved the intimate seating   Food:  All items are small plates, perfect to share a few with someone, which is exactly what we did. The menu changes up to accommodate to seasonal foods that are sourced locally and also caters to the unique creativity of recipes that are constantly being updated.  *Dates* A plate of dates served over a squash sauce. I recognized the taste of ghee (clarified butter) that was in the sauce (a taste from my childhood- almost as good as my mom's homemade ghee), and it really added to the richness of the flavors surrounding the dates. The dates were so soft, warm, and melts in your mouth.   *Gnocchi*  the menu describes the gnocchi as \"potato pillows\" and that's exactly what they were..tiny pillows of potato, super soft, melt-in-your mouth little bites of heaven. This special gnocchi had a sweet taste from the marsala butter sauce it was soaked in, had a crispy topping that was the perfect touch. It was rich, so it was the best bowl for sharing. So, so delicious I want more NOW.  *Chocolate Lava Cake with Gelato* OH. MY. Goodness. This dessert was the perfect ending to our night. The chocolate cake was so decadent and almost brownie-ish tasting, filled with a fudge-like filling. It was served with a salted caramel gelato on top. The salted caramel gelato was my favorite tasting gelato at this place out of the three that we tried that nightl.  *Gelato* my friend and I wanted to try another gelato on the side of our chocolate cake + gelato dessert...(yes, more gelato!!) and we were debating between pistachio and hazelnut. Our waitress acknowledged our perplexity over this issue and kindly offered to give us both- 1/2 pistachio and 1/2 hazelnut. It was a little hard to differentiate the two after we were served the gelato, and I'm sure that's because they don't add any crazy food colorings, which is amazing! So both were kind of a tan color with finely chopped nuts mixed in. Both were delicious, creamy, and not too sweet.  Drinks: specially handcrafted cocktails-- *Virtu Starter Kit* this was such a refreshing drink. I wanted something light and citrusy, but still strong and one that hit the spot. I highly recommend this drink if you're looking for something not too sweet, light, and refreshing. Ingredients: Cocchi Vermouth di Torino, Gin, Grapefruit Bitters, Bitter Lemon Soda, Lemon Essence. I ordered two of these.  I can tell the cooks, owners, entire staff put their hearts and souls into each and every item on the menu including the drinks. I will most certainly go back to try more items from Virtu. The food and service exceeded my expectations. No wonder they were nominated for the James Beard Foundation Award AND according to Esquire, one of the best new restaurants in America when they first opened!",

It's super quaint, has a great patio and is sort of attached to a little B n B. Who knew?  We went there for restaurant week and it was my first time.  Fantastic! I was especially happy to have lamb skewers as a appetizer option. Lamb is the best food ever.  The lamb was cooked to perfection and the hummus like sauce was a perfect compliment. I also got the veal chop which was also cooked perfectly.  Great crust on the outside and tender on the inside. And huge. For desert we got the chocolate cake option and it was rich and full of chocolate flavor.  What set this restaurant over the top were the employees.  I was early for our reservation and the bartender was super friendly.  a huge shout out to Ivan, our waiter. Give that guy a raise!  He explained all kinds of info about the restaurant, brunch, the history, the chef.... He also gave tips about what to order during non restaurant weeks.  We will definitely be back.",

We were seated in the courtyard, which is so perfect this time of year.   I began with my favorite sparkling wine, Moscato di Asti, which always puts me in a celebratory mood. For starters our table ordered the lamb skewers and the burrata salad. You won't want to share your lamb, so order your own, but the burrata is so rich, it can indeed serve two.  My dinner entree was a delicious pasta dish ... but the piece de resistance was a grilled veal chop with THE MOST DELICIOUS sauteed sweet onions I've ever tasted in my entire life.  This dish was OUTSTANDING, in fact, I just made reservations for next week to bring my entire family. We have a well behaved dog, and so this allows all 8 of us (plus Fido) to enjoy a lovely evening under the stars.  I definitely plan on ordering that veal chop again!!!  Dessert: it is not an afterthought. In fact, I must commend Virtu for their gelato selections, there were quite a lot to choose from. I ordered 3 flavors: salted caramel, dark chocolate and vanilla chocolate chip. If you don't order the gelato you'll miss out. It's THAT great! I also had their sticky chocolate cake. It's very sweet, so plan on sharing it with the table. You'll only need a bite of the cake as you'll be devouring your gelato ...  What more can I say? Visit Virtu, you will love it!",

My only dislike of the whole dining experience is that we were seated right inside the entrance and the tables are very close together.  Had to try the octopus and now I can't stop thinking about it. The lemon pasta was very good as well with a perfect serving size (I shared with my friend).  We both had the pork chop and it was wonderful.  Although i was convinced I couldn't eat another bite, she talked me into the decadent chocolate dessert.  Our wait staff was Matteo (sp) and he was wonderful.",

I would dress up a little more for this place its nicer with white tablecloth. A word of warning the coffee is ADDICTING. I have like 4 cups when I go and am bouncing off the walls afterward. The menu is always changing but everything I have ever tried has been delicious. This past time I have a crepe filled with Bri and Ham. It was a very large which was great because I enjoyed every bite. Every single dish is always so well thought out and I always have trouble choosing because it alls pounds good. I always have excellent service and always look forward to my next visit. I would like to try it for dinner I just haven't had the opportunity yet. Try this place.

We had the trio of small plates with tuna tartare, a sausage/potatoes dish, and croquettes. Then we shared a bucatini pasta which was fabulous. But the highlight was the grilled octopus. I am still dreaming of that dish!   I am so glad we did not skip dessert. We had a butterscotch pudding that was divine.   The wine list is very creative with several regional French, Italian, and Spanish options.    Service was also exceptional.

We ordered all the most recommended dishes, including octopus, asparagus, pigs ears, and short ribs, and each was delicious and beautifully presented. However, the restaurant was generally uninterested in accommodating the palates of our two small kids, though the one option we had (spaghetti with red sauce) turned out to be a hit. In fact, the tenor with which we were received at the restaurant only turned positive once we placed our order for a bottle of wine, which made us wonder if they assumed we were not likely to order a substantial meal. We were also told that there were no reservations other than 5:00, and then found ourselves dining alone for about an hour before others arrived-which again left us wondering if we were only offered an early option because we were with kids. Not sure, and again, it worked out ok for us, but this is not necessarily the easiest place to bring children. Coming from a city where fine dining does not mean excluding children, we thought our experience here was worth noting.",

This is a small restaurant and the kitchen ventilation is not very good. It gets stocky easily when sitting inside. It was supposed to be a romantic restaurant but my shirt smelled like I just had some grill BBQ after my dinner.",

    "text": "This was my first meal in Scottsdale and I was blown away by everything I tasted. I really had no idea that the food overall in this town was so good, and Virtu was hands down the best. In fact, if it were my call they'd have at least one Michelin star. Seriously, one of the best meals I've had in a while.   The True standouts from everything I tasted were ( and in no particular order) -  The Charred Octopus - the flavors were right on and it was texturally satisfying as it was cooked to perfection. Probably the best octopus I've ever eaten. It's no coincidence that this is one of their most popular items on the menu.   The Smoked Duck Breast - really good flavor here and again, cooked to perfection. The smokiness is by no means overwhelming, just the right subtlety to know its there yet taste the duck and the plum (which also was subtle and not at all sweet)  The Chicken and Wild Mushroom Cannelloni - well now, maybe I should have put this one on top and listed in order of preference because thinking more about it, this just might be my favorite of all!!! This dish was exceptional! So flavorful. Quintessential happy, comfort food yet was still quite light. The pasta was very delicate and more crepe-like. The earthy yet pleasingly flavorful mushroom jus was spectacular. I'll dream fondly of this dish.   They have a very nice wine list and creative cocktails. Their signature G&T is the ideal desert libation. Service was just fine too, I was surprised to read negative reviews in this regard.   I'm not huge on dessert but their sticky toffee cake was fantastic and if I could choose a dessert menu this would be on it.   If I'm ever back in Scottsdale I will most definitely return to this restaurant. In fact, that Bespoke Inn that it's located in looks like a great place to stay. I definitely have to look into that, though this time not in the heat of the summer.",

The hostess was incredibly accommodating and so polite.  The ambiance was very cozy and quaint and very European.  The entire staff was incredibly attentive and on point all evening.  OK, the food.  mind blowing.  The Polpo is a must try for your starter course.  May very well be one of our top 5 dining experiences ever.  Keep up the incredible work Virtu.  We will most certainly return soon.  Chad M. Rothe",

Well, the atmosphere is great, nice and cozy...but they rushed us to order all the courses which started things off on a bad foot.  When celebrating an occasion, or paying good money for a meal, I'd prefer to take a little time to enjoy.  Our server actually said she wasn't allowed to put our first course in before we'd decided and ordered all of our courses.  We expressed concern but went along with the program.  Both of our first courses then came out cold, which seemed to indicate that they had the items just waiting to go out, which is the concern with prix fixe in the first place.  We decided to cut our losses at this point and told them we were leaving...their response, \"we're not for everybody.\"  Ok...guess you aren't, thanks!",

    "text": "Came for a date night with another couple, a first time for all of us and the service from start to finish was amazing! We made a 6:30pm reservation.  This is a great place for a special occasion celebration.    The menu changes frequently (monthly I believe)  for fresh ingredients and available seasonal items--and everything looked amazing on the menu!   Our server Ivan was able to navigate us through the menu and accommodate my gluten allergy.  Everything was gluten free with the exception of the homemade pasta and maybe 1 other item!   We started with a bottle of Cabernet from Napa Valley, and decided to indulge in the 1 constant menu item, THE BISTECCA TAGLIATA 40oz niman tomahawk ribeye, rucola, chimichurri $130.00 price tag but for a special occasion it was worth every bite and it took about 45minutes to prepare, we were willing to wait.  The Tomahawk prepared medium rare had a huge argulua salad and chimichurri was fresh and perfect.  The meat was tender and sliced for easy sharing.   CAPPESANTE |seared scallops, roasted cauliflower, lemon tahini, pine nuts, urfa biber, mint. The scallops, were huge and tender and delicious, the accompanied sauce was creamy and perfect.  ANATRA | smoked duck, radicchio insalata, pear brown butter, smoked onion & taleggio phyllo. The duck, cooked medium was adapted to be gluten free, they adjusted the salad for me and added cherries and hibiscus.  Again cooked to perfection the skin was crispy and the duck was tender, just wished there was a little more.   We shared these items between the 4 of us, along with dessert. The Sticky Toffee Pudding (not gluten free) was devoured and the Butterscotch pudding (gluten free) was rich and the perfect ending to our dinner. We left satisfied, very happy but not overly full.   10/10 recommend!  The space is small, they have a bar with maybe 8 seats and behind the bar you can peak into the small the kitchen. The have a small dining area, but comfortable. The vibe is upscale, but intimate and cozy with small candles on the tables.   Looking forward to another opportunity to enjoy.   They do offer brunch on the weekends but check their website as the days and times change seasonally.    Next time we will try the Octopus-- POLPO | lemon marinated ceci, calabrese chile butter, rucola and fennel insalata, balsamico and  ASPARAGI | two wash ranch duck egg, feta, bacon candy, foie gras hollandaise, truffle drizzle and And the MAIALE | pork rib chop, rosemary brown butter basted, crispy sunchokes, caramelized onion.    Thank you Ivan for the food suggestions, modifications and excellent evening.",

    "text": "It was our first time dining here, and it's our new favorite restaurant. It seemed like a restaurant in Europe with the smaller space making it seem quaint and intimate. It's got a smaller menu than many places with unique dishes, and what is on the menu is superbly executed.  We were 2 people and ordered one appetizer (the octopus), three entrees (which the server \"coursed out\" for us to seem like a second course before the entrees) and a desert. We also had two cocktails, a bottle of wine and port. The octopus was wonderful, not dry, and had more flavor than any octopus I have ever had. Th man next to us just returned from Greece and said it was better than any he'd had there.  The service was fantastic. Servers were very knowledgeable about the items. The duck was the best duck I have ever tasted, no gaminess and none of the oiliness you often get. I cannot commit to order an entree of duck due to past history, so I'm glad my friend did, because it was amazing. The pasta with meatballs was out of this world and the savory flavors made me wish I had a piece of bread to get every last bit of flavor from the dish.  The scallops, oh the scallops, they were uniquely seasoned and perfectly cooked with caramelization and yet perfect texture. Clearly they have wizards working in the kitchen. I would order the scallops again, the duck, the octopus, and the pasta. And the ciocolatino cake is to die for.  I recommend going at least 15 min before your reservation and having a craft cocktail. Fernando makes some mean drinks. I'm turning violet, Violet was fantastic and the whiskey sour was the best I've tasted in the valley. I only have photos of drinks as I was too busy savoring every bite to get photos.",

We got an outdoor seating which as very well designed with lights and greenery used to separate tables for privacy.  First course:   -Grilled octopus, very well made -Burata, didn't want to waste the delicious appetizer so we asked for more bread twice.  2nd Course: -Pappardelle pasta with duck egg on top.  Wow! A must have.  Main course- 2 had pork chops  3 had orata fish 1 had scallops   Everything was good except 1)  the pork chops were luke warm.  I prefer my food hot. 2). Only got 3 scallops which was more expensive than the fish.  Why not 5? 3).  Got charged $4.00 for extra bread.  Classy place with the price that goes with it...can't give extra bread without a charge.  Really?    Hostess just ok.  Our waiter was excellent.  Honestly, I'm not sure if I would go back because there's so many restaurants to try in Phoenix metro areas.  I do invite you to try it for yourself.  Main course:",

There are a few items that are standard on the menu- the octopus and asparagus and beef. There's a reason. Try them. You won't go wrong. The Polpo was tender and delicious and quite frankly reminded me of lobster as per our server. Probably close to my top octopus dish to rival the octopus at the Purple Pig in Chicago which is saying a lot. The Burrata was perfectly paired with frisee. Spaghettini. Why would you order spaghetti at a high end restaurant you ask? Bec it's not your kids spaghetti, but kids would love this too. The scallops. Sweet baby Jesus the scallops. If you like scallops at all get these. There are  only 3 but what an amazing 3 they are.  We (2) ordered 2 starters, a pasta and 2 entrees and it was more food than we could finish but so worth it. Don't make the same mistake we did and leave room for dessert so you don't suffer from food envy when you see other diners enjoying the menu of sweet treats.",

Yes, it have four dollar signs, so if you're used to dinner for two for $50-60, this will feel rather expensive for you. BUT, it's WORTH every dollar.  We came for restaurant week, but you didn't have to follow the menu and could order a la carte if you wanted. I stuck to the restaurant week menu and had some of the most divine food. DEVINE!! The atmosphere is soft and romantic (patio) indoors is nice as well. The wait staff were all incredibly friendly. But. The. Food. Y'all. THE FOOD!  We started with the ice queen and the you're turning violet, violet cocktails (do yourself a favor and read through the entire cocktail menu for some of the punniest sayings). Which were delightful. Then we started with the mozerella and the panelle, followed by the asparagi, then to our main dishes of the vitello and the chitarra.  ALL OF WHICH WAS AMAZING! Then, dessert of pudding and the chocolate cake. Which are pale descriptions to the amazingness that was these desserts. If you have the chance to go here, go.  Want to feel fancy, go. Want to have a food experience, go. Want to wow your date with the best food, go. Go. Go. And go again.",

    "text": "Came back here again for an early Valentine's Day dinner and it was just as good as the first time! It gets crowded on weekends without a reservation so be sure to make one!   We sat at the bar because we didn't make a reservation and we grabbed the last two seats in the house. Even though it was a little squeezy, sitting at the bar was quite interesting because you get to see the rush making the drinks and the bartender/waiters will engage in conversation with you so overall even just waiting for the food was a good experience.   This time we ordered:   Polpo (5/5): we got this the first time and even though they don't give a lot, the octopus is perfectly tasty and chewy! It's consistent which is good. Def recommend this to anyone trying virtu   Cappesante *Scallops*(5/5): i don't remember what exactly it was called cause they change their menu often but it had scallops and pork belly with some sort of onion vegetable under. Scallops were cooked perfectly (not the rubbery kind) and the dish was full of flavor!   Anatra *duck (3.5/5): again depending on what time you come what they pair the duck with will be differentiate. This time it was a smoked duck with a chocolate sauce and mandarin oranges. Although I appreciated their efforts in pairing the duck and chocolate, it just didn't go together. When I came two years ago their duck was perfect so I think it just depends what they decide to create for the menu depending on what time you come. Duck was cooked well but the sauce was just weird with it haha.   Cciocolato *Sticky toffee pudding (5/5): had this the first time I was here and it was so good had to order it again and it was consistently perfect! It is paired with a salted caramel gelato. The cake is perfectly moist and not over sweet or over salty and everything comes together perfectly!   For drinks, I don't remember the exact name but one had lavender (I think the name has violet in it) and it was unique amazing! I would rate it 5/5. And the other drink was a berry drink with egg white on top. I would give that one a 3.5/5. Pictures are attached.   Overall I still love this place and think it is the perfect place if you want to go to fine dining! Though I didn't enjoy all the dishes the service was still great and I had an overall great experience. Maybe just not all the time since it's on the pricy side but it's good for special occasions!",

We went early because we were going to a concert and they whisked us right in (with a reservation). The weather was perfect (end of March) and we sat outdoors on the patio. Even though it is a relatively small area, the set up of the patio gives it a very intimate yet private feel. It appears to be connected to a small boutique hote.  From the moment we sat down, it was an exceptional experience. Our server was incredibly knowledgable and had a lot of great ideas about our sit down cocktails. He also talked us through the menu from start to finish. It's a great idea to share dishes as there is so much to experience. Our drinks were delicious. The food was exquisite and I will continuously recommend this spot to others.   I really can't say enough - this is a go-to dinner spot.",

A must go when we have family or friends in town, they can't leave without experiencing Virtu.  Service is very professional and quick. Hok served us many times and is great.  The changing menu is so attractive and tempting, it will keep you going back. I'm not going to highlight the few dishes we like here because literally, everything on the menu we've had was fantastic, including their brunch menu.  They have some classic as well as crafted cocktails and they are fantastic too. The fortified truth and ice queen are our favorites.  Without question a leading top 5 restaurant for us in PHX.",

Not that we have shortage of stake in California, but wanted something different. And different I got- it was a beautiful monstrosity with charred edges and sides, on a bed of leafy greens, chimichurry and aioli. It was tasty, and the sides were light and complimented it very well. I just wasn't ready for the charring. The waiter did explain the cooking process to me in a nice way, I almost didn't notice the subtle condescending tone as he did so.   One of the salads was really salty, we had to send it back. Just way too salty- and garnished with unnecessary awkward colored flowers.  With so many great restaurants popping up in Scottsdale, it is doubtful it deserves a second visit.",

    "text": "I was so disappointed, especially how much I was looking forward to the dining experience:  I used to be a Sous Chef at a restaurant that, like virtu, does seasonal, farm-to-table menus. After viewing the menu, reading reviews, and seeing pictures I knew this place would be perfect for a special date I was planning for my girlfriend.   I called 3 days in advance and requested a table somewhere a little quiet and private so we could enjoy our night together. It was so important that I even called an hour in advance, again, just to double check that everything was squared away. They assured me that everything was good to go.  We arrived after attending an event in Phoenix, right on time for our reservation at 7:45pm. When I got to the hostess stand, she told me that I now had to wait an hour to eat. So I went to the bar, and kindly waited while the bartender shelled out a couple old fashioned for the gentlemen next to me, but her attitude changed when she saw me. Full disclosure, I am in my mid 20s, so I can imagine that, but it only added to the already disappointing experience thus far. She actually went as far as to take other peoples' drink orders before mine, probably assuming I was going to not tip or something--always tip 20%. I did end up getting my drink, but I almost definitely was on the bottom of the priority list.   Finally when we got to the table it was not anything close to what I asked for and was assured to recieve... our table was right in front of where the hostess stand and servers run food and bus tables--I cannot tell you how close I sat to that table and still got bumped into.   The waiter had the same reaction to my girlfriend and me that the bartender did--apathetic because of a False predisposition is my guess. We finally ordered around 9:00 after being sat around 8:40, but we didn't get our food until closer to 9:30--lamb shank and duck if I remember correctly. Albeit, the food was good, but not what I was expecting. The duck was slightly overcooked and the lamb shank was little dry, but nothing horrible.  On the bright side, It wasn't the worst first experience I've had at a restaurant, probably won't be the last, but I just wish that this restaurant wasn't on the list of \"bad first impressions.\"",

Both good, I wish the salad came with some bread or something to spread it on since there was a large goat cheese spread. For dinner we got lamb and duck. Both were large rich portions. The lamb will be about 3 meals for me. I wish there was a little more veggies in the main dishes, they were very rich and meat heavy. For dessert I looooved the hazelnut gelato with espresso. It was small and not a typical dessert dish, but was very tasty. That would be good with a second dessert like cake :)",

It was our first time during restaurant week and loved the charming decor, low lighting and excellent service. It reminded us of sweet little Portland restaurants. 2 years later, I selected this place for my Check Please, AZ audition...and was chosen for a segment! It aired earlier this year and was so glad that such a local gem was able to showcase their talent. Unfortunately for us, the secret is out!   You must try the cocktails (ALL OF THEM) preferably the Ice Queen (vodka, my drink of choice), anything with bourbon in it and the wine selection is extensive and fantastic. Pricey, but fantastic, the scallops with corn 5 ways and the squid with chickpeas. The dishes are plated beautifully and the servers are great at recommending items if you have never dined with them before.  You can tell that the chefs take great care in the food they are putting out there and of course it is all cooked to perfection. Seasoning, sauces, sides were all scrumptious. It's in a great little spot next to the Bespoke Inn. Even though we are locals (I am a Native Arizonan) it makes you want to stay at the inn so you get to enjoy the restaurant for one more day.",

The reservation was made weeks earlier without any such notice.  Comparable restaurants in the area were seeking $75pp. When angrily asked how the restaurant was going to correct its error, the two recommendations were: 1) still come and pay the minimum or 2) they'd cancel the reservation. What?! How is that fair to the patron  when the restaurant is in error?! Mateo had no problem hanging up the phone twice during the conversation because of a raised voice. Heck, yes, a raised voice demanded a just resolution - it's 20 days prior to the hottest dinner night in the country! This insanely poor treatment to a patron who frequented the restaurant is unfathomable. Go elsewhere - there are plenty of equally delicious places to choose from!",

Tried two appetizers, the Polpo (Octopus) was spectacular.  One of the best octopus dishes I have tasted.  Meaty, yet super tender, with a nice smoky finish. The Tuna Crudo was also very good.  We thought the quality of the fish was outstanding, although I found the sauce a bit too sweet for my liking.  The main courses were the Sea Bream, Short Rib and Pasta.  The Sea Bream was delicious with a nice crispy skin and a slightly sweet topping, which worked perfectly.  I thought the standout dish was the Short Rib.  Amazingly tender with sweet pepper and leek sides that took the dish to a whole new level.  The Sauce for the pasta was extremely fresh and felt truly handmade from scratch.  We ended it with a dessert platter, made up of pistachio gelato and pear fig sorbetto, butternut toffee cake, a butternut toffee type mousse, and a strawberry type short cake.  Don't recall the exact names for each dish, but suffice it to say each and everyone was to die for.  It's been a while since we have had desserts of such high quality.  Our group finished everything on the platter, and it was a good sized platter!  The service was friendly, relaxed, yet professional.  Totally on the mark.  In summary, this was one of the best meals we have had in a while, paired with a great outdoor setting, and excellent service.  A memorable meal all around.",

    "text": "This was far more than a meal; this was an experience. Actually, this was two meals: we enjoyed ourselves so much we went back two nights later.   Friday night: very busy, but we hung out at the cocktail pit near the fire until a table was available. Cocktails: a Spice Market and something like \"not your grandma's root beer\" or something like that. Both were very good. Inside, it's rather tight. But I had a great view of the bartender and the kitchen going in the back. Seemed kinda cramped for the staff; dishes stacked up on the bar while tables were cleared, but then the staff all seemed to come together to clear those off quickly. Very happy, positive vibe in the restaurant.   Started with the octopus, and it was tremendous. I don't know if the whole \"cooked in cork\" thing is real or not, but the octopus was truly an amazing experience. Then we had the rabbit gnocci, which was also amazing. It really was an awesome experience, and the wine we wanted wasn't chilled yet, so Hoke the manager came over and gave us a pour each of something that was ready, while ours chilled. Dessert: pistachio gelato that was out of this world. And I think we also had the chocolate gelato, which was also fab.   Sunday night: far less busy. Got a table outside. Chilled at the cocktail pit and we had to go find someone to take our order after 15 minutes. Another Spice Market and an Ice Queen. Both were good. Then table outside was great. Started with the pate, which, ethics aside, was phenomenal. And then the black squid ink linguine with prawn. Which was tremendous. And the duck was fab. Espresso was grand, as was the pistachio pudding and I forget which kind of new gelato we tried. Again the wine was excellent.   Overall, the food and ambiance were amazing, and I now have very, very positive feelings about Scottsdale, in large part based on our experiences at Virtu. We had hear about this place from Clark the gallery guy, and if you meet Clark, give him a high-five for me, since he really nailed it. Both nights the service was excellent, the staff was well-informed, and the ambiance was delightful. My only regret is that I can't give it six stars here.   I will be visiting Virtu every time I am in Scottsdale from this day forward. And, I am telling everyone about it.",

I am huge fan of octopus and normally order it when I see it on the menu.  This was actually a very generous portion for the price.  I am from LA, though. It came with a nice and simple arugula salad.   For my entree, I ordered the scallops.  I'm so glad that I did!  They were perfectly cooked.  They were topped with nuts of some sort,which I normally don't like, but in this case adored.  My drinks were delicious as well, aromatic! The bartender whipped something up for me when I asked his to make me a drink with St. Germain's.  I love the smell of citrus rind.  I sat at the bar by myself.  The bartenders were extremely attentive and friendly.  They gave great recommendations!",

My husband and I had our anniversary dinner here and the staff could NOT have been more accommodating - friendly, knowledgable and professional. Had the burrata with poached pears - heavenly! Pasta with sardines - YUM - the Chardonnay by the glass was the right accompaniment. We stayed at the hotel next door so we go to have brunch at this wonderful place the next day. Best bloody Mary ever and the crepes were sensational. Perfectly cooked and filled with paper thin slices of Parma ham topped with perfectly cooked over easy eggs, Mornay and chives. I hear the grilled octopus is a specialty and can't wait to go back to try it. We live about 2 hours away from this place but it is worth the drive to eat here.",

I say hidden because I've lived in the old town area for over 3 years and never knew it was there.  It's a place that allows you to feel like your in another world but right here in the desert. The lay out of the patio is really nice & quaint, with large olive trees, fresh lavender growing in nearby flower beds, and a fresh airy mood that any patio-goer would enjoy!   Getting to the food, we shared an asparagus w/ duck egg dish as a starter which was perfectly cooked and flavorful. We then each ordered meat, she had the the short rib, and I the duck. Both cooked medium rare and very tasty indeed. These menu items won't likely be on yours as they only have a few dishes that are always available. From what I gathered this place creates new and exciting meals daily so that each dining experience is different and based on seasonal offerings from both the garden and the farm. All in all we had a great time, you should check it out too!",

Well the rib I ordered a tad over medium arrived medium rare so back it went..but what pissed me off is that the waiter didn't mention...this was 40 ounces!  Come on that is a ridiculous amount of beef and he should have said this is a huge amount you need to split.  But no, the dingbat didn't bother.   Lame.   Otherwise delicious",

Our server greeted us within the fist minute of seating, and he was wonderful from there! We ordered drinks, and the Ice Queen was amazing, although rather expensive, but totally worth it. Since my s/o is a vegetarian I thought they would have at least some options on the menu to choose from, they barely had 2 out of the entire menu! And the one option they did have for a main course (pasta), he said was mediocre at best. Really disappointing. My short rib was amazing, but when the one your with isn't enjoying themselves, it's hard to enjoy it as well. 5 for the service, 5 for the drinks, but 2 for the menu options :/.",

The staff was SUPER friendly and quick to get to your table. The drinks were delicious - two of us had bloody marys and really it's the best one I've ever had. Wowza. All four of us had separate entrees - and all of us couldn't shovel it down fast enough. Ingredients were fresh, great portions, the flavors while interesting and not always what you'd typically expect, were spot on. I just can't say enough great things about Virtu. It was perfect down to the seating... We sat out on their adorable little patio this past Saturday... couldn't have asked for a better setting. So if (when) you visit Virtu, try a Bloody Mary and get the Pork Ragu... then hop on here and thank me. ;)",

And my husband had the Bronzino; he said the skin was crispy while the fish was still soft and tender. Dessert was a dual creme brulee: one white choc and one semi-sweet choc with three choc truffles and salted caramel. Are you drooling yet? The service was friendly and efficient. The meal was well paced. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Very cool restaurant from start to finish.  I went for my anniversary, drank and ate too much, and I am already looking forward to my next birthday/anniversary/special occasion to go back!  I started off with a cocktail and moved into a red wine as the food started to arrive.  It is evident that the menu is well thought out and is deliberately crafted to eliminate indecision while offering a wide array of choices.   The plates come out as works of art that taste as good as they look.  I started with the truffled steak tartare and my wife with the burrata.  Truffle was not overwhelming but present, followed by the mushroom cream sauce laced with capers and finished with the delicious tartare.  A must for those considering a steak tartare!  The burrata also amazing, individual ingredients are amazng but when combined, watch out, outrageous.    After finishing appetizers came time for entrees, I the squid ink linguine and my wife the duck breast.  These were both well crafted and cooked to perfection all around.  Duck was well matched by the kale and tabouleh.  The linguine, perfection for those who would appreciate a squid ink linguine, deep flavor throughout, lightened up by fresh cherry tomatoes and white wine sauce.  The dish also includes a grilled octopus which was a plus as I did not opt for the octopus appetizer, despite wanting to, and a very tasty linguica sausage.  (America would be a better place with a little more linguica)...   Finished with a PB&J desert which was over the top, too much to eat in one sitting and as a result I am very much so looking forward to an excellent lunch as well!! We took or time and felt very welcome for the duration.  More places need to be like Virtu.",

    "text": "I have been hearing a lot about this cozy spot, voted one of the \"Best New Restaurants in America\" by Esquire magazine.  That's a lot to live up to, and precisely why when a reputation precedes you - expectations tend to be higher.  Virtu is located at the equally comfy Bespoke Inn, where each suite is unique and has a private patio ($249 for a night). Gourmet brunch at Virtu is included in the room rate.  Seating at Virtu is limited inside and out - with one intimate table for two outside, two tables for four, and a large community. Heat lamps are ubiquitous so you can always sit outside.  It is quite tranquil with the bubbling fountain in the courtyard, and old gnarled trees strung with lights and lanterns.  Inside the mood is more upbeat, but lighting equally conducive for romance and intimacy.   There are ten tables inside with bar seating. When we arrived at 6p on a Tuesday night, a few tables were occupied - we were the only people outside.  ***BEST THING TO KNOW ABOUT VIRTU: COME EARLY FOR DINNER, NO MATTER THE DAY OF THE WEEK. BY 6:30P IT STARTS TO GET BUSY. RESERVATIONS ARE IDEAL IF COMING AT A LATER TIME. ONCE THE RESTAURANT FILLS UP, EXPECT A LONGER WAIT FOR YOUR FOOD.   Having arrived there before the rush, our appetizers came out quickly, but our one entree of house made spaghetti ordered, took nearly an hour.  By 7:30 we were handed a dessert menu, but having been there an hour and a half - we were ready to head home.  Another ten min wait to get the check...  Disclaimer: When you're pregnant and hungry you don't want to wait an hour for your food.  Pregnant and tired you don't want to sit there for twenty minutes twiddling your thumbs because your partner finished his cocktail long ago, and you already polished off your second mock tail....  So, how was the food?  Half dozen starters from Grilled Octopus (fennel, arugula, lemon chick pea, chile butter) to Grilled Asparagus (egg, feta, bacon candy, foie gras hollandaise, truffle oil).  Also Tartare Duo of Steak and Ahi Tuna, Winter Vegetable Salad, and Chef's Rillette.  Avg. price: $14  We ordered the Asparagus and Octopus. Asparagus - Six small pieces of asparagus, couple tablespoons of feta, hollandaise that does not smack or reminisce of my beloved foie, nor any truffle oil -and an over abundance of candied bacon makes it unique, but a disappointment not worth $14, for someone who loves foie and truffle.  I would have brought this up to our server, but I had already sent back the Octopus.  Octopus - tender but very charred and dry on outside, and almost cold.  Server stated it gets cold quickly, and explained effects of char grilling food (I know what char-grilling is, but come on). Long story short he offered to have the appetizer redone and it came back perfectly executed.  And yes, when it's done right I think it's probably the best dish on this menu and why everyone that has tried it, loves it so much.  Of the entrees, there are 9 of them, and average price is $30 - starting with Prosciutto Wrapped Pork Rib Chops, Scallops, Seared Ahi Tuna, Smoked Duck Breast, Seared Branzino, Squid Ink Linguini, Nieman Ranch Ribeye, and Grilled Monkfish fillet.  We tried the House made Spaghetti with Osso Bucco.  After having waited an hour for our Spaghetti, we were disappointed at the al dente style of the noodles.  Our server explained they were made with semolina flour, which are typically on the al dente side - but just not to our liking.  The sauce was great and the shredded veal   tender and flavorful - Although there was so much, and it was so rich, almost bordering on the greasy side.  It just seemed off on such a traditional dish.  It was more like having shredded pork with a side of chewy spaghetti.  When I order Osso Bucco, it's traditionally the shank with the bone in it.  So this was not what I expected, either.  When it comes to food, I am all about texture, and despite loving inventive twists and even esoteric fare, I am a traditionalist when it comes to comfort foods like Spaghetti.   So, food wise, there are too many wonderful options out there in the valley - but those that have commented on how amazing and clever the cocktails are, are right!  It is worth coming here for Happy Hour and going down the menu.  Although I merely took a small swish to sample on our visit, I could tell that the Bar Master here has a True knack for his craft.  The Nuova Bellezza $11, is a great example with Alexander Grappa, St. Germain, Cabernet Syrup, Lime Juice, and Red Grapes.  The online menu does not do the offerings justice, find a more thorough and extensive cocktail journey at the bar.  So based on the other reviews, perhaps on our visit it was an off night.  Perhaps we had too many expectations, or just did not order dishes that were an accurate reflection of Chef Gio Osso's talent.  But with a Machiavellian name for achieving excellence, I feel Virtu should have lived up to its name.",

I really wanted to have some Italian food (maybe a little \"heavy\" food?) but they only served some light food as brunch. I had a grilled cheese, which didn't taste Italian, but it was great. Love the combination, and I think it's very heathy but too light for me at that  time. My husband had a grilled octopus, which the waiter told us it was a big fish that we might want to share. But it's a very not that big enough to be shared. I forgot my desert name, and they don't have the same menu showing online, but it's not bad, too sweet. My husband had gelato which he said it's the best.",

This was a little bit salty for my taste including the salad it was served with.  The texture of the calamari was perfect, not too chewy. For entrees we got the duck, the scallops and the squid ink pasta. The duck was absolutely amazing!!!  The scallops were also cooked perfectly. The squid ink pasta was a little bland and simple and dos not seem to be up to par to the other entrees. For dessert we shared the salted caramel chocolate cake. Amazing!!!  Overall, great food, had some down points as listed above.  The ambience is unbeatable!!",

Charming dining room decor and a patio dining area to enjoy a meal al fresco are what greets you along with a friendly staff.  To maximize our visit we ordered 4 entrees to share.  The burrata is surprisingly authentic -- ooey gooey texture just like in Naples and framed by the sweetness of grapes (maybe go a bit lighter on the grapes ... a little goes a long way) and the peppery edge of arugula.  The pepperonata with egg over potatoes had a nice touch of heat just after a big burst of flavor.  The burger was a bit unwieldy -- more like a patty melt on grilled bread rather than a burger \"proper\" -- but the patty was flavorful and cooked to a perfect medium.  The grilled cheese with bacon and mushrooms was a table favorite -- earthy &  smokey flavors made this childhood favorite a bona fide \"grown up\" meal.  This small taste piqued my interest for where dinner menu adventures might take me.  Unfortunately that will have to wait for another visit -- hopefully that will be soon!",

My better half and I don't eat a lot and usually order an appetizer,  share a salad and share a main course and we are good to go.   We had 2 appetizers here and ordered a pasta and a main course to share.   The main course was duck, we were served 5 small medallions and about 8 hard Brussels sprouts scattered around plate.  It was more like an appetizer and yet it was in the main course section.   We ordered another pasta after we saw how small the main course was,  which was also very small,  just to kind of be full.  After 2 appetizers,  2 full orders of pasta (ummmm tiny portions) and 2 tiny bites I got of the duck (my better have had the other 3 tiny pieces), we were both still hungry.  We are about $250 in at this point (includes alcohol) and we love to have coffee, espresso, dessert wines and dessert when we go out but we just left.   If you decide to come here, I would suggest drinks only and skip the meal or overpriced snacks,  they are way over priced tiny appetizers as far as I'm concerned.  The food was fantastic but coming from a small girl who doesn't eat much, I say save your money in the food department and go somewhere else where they actually serve relatively normal portion sizes.   We went home,  had a few more drinks and made some food to eat and had dessert wines and coffee at home after our $300 outing of a few drinks and some tastey snacks (includes the tip). Our waiter was attentive but a bit pretentious.",

The service was great, the food was delicious and the ambiance was perfect. It provided a wonderfully romantic evening for us. This is definitely worth trying. We sat outside, which might not have worked out during the summer months, but weather permitting, the patio is delightfully whimsical. If this place doesn't get you to date #2, it's you.",

First, before we arrived I started receiving text reminders about my reservation, and then received a confirmation call. When we arrived we were warmly welcomed and wished a happy anniversary from several staff. The service was attentive, the food was so special. Grilled octopus, smoked duck, and more. And to celebrate our anniversary we were given two different glasses of wine to compliment the duck, two glasses of champagne, and a dessert for us to share, all on the house. This is a great place we will be retuning to. The menu changes sometimes daily depending on what is locally fresh. This is not food, it's cuisine and art. It's a small place inside with a large patio which is larger than the indoor seating is. The patio is beautiful. In one word Perfect!!!",

No reservations were available but very lucky for us they had a spot for 2 that allowed us to enjoy the most incredible meal ever.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who can appreciate the talents of a chef who thinks outside the box!  We enjoyed the Octopus starter, the gnocchi were beyond amazing and our entree - Swordfish cheek served on a bone was the most incredible plate we have ever been served.

    "text": "This was on my place to try for a long time and finally had a chance to try here this week. They change menu frequently based on reviews, I knew some of them are always there and I wanted to try them.  First thing I noticed about this restaurant was a rosemary they placed in the napkin and silverware set.  I immediately pulled out of the rosemary and enjoyed the nice scent of rosemary.  Their wine menu consist mainly California and Italy, but a few selections from other parts of the world. Since I wanted to have scallops for dinner, I chose a bottle of Spanish wine, which I somehow finished the bottle. Their wine menu was not extensive but they carry nice wines.  Two of the appetizers I read on others reviews here were Charred octopus and Asparagus, and naturally we ordered both. I always enjoy grilled octopus anywhere, in fact I never had bad grilled octopus. They serve their grilled octopus with chili butter. Chili butter was slightly spicy but when I ate with arugula and octopus together, bitterness of arugula and chili spice blended well with grilled octopus.  Grilled asparagus was also good, slightly runny fried duck egg, mixed with feta cheese, salty bacon, and foie gras hollandaise sauce all together, I cleaned the plate to get the last bit of the hollandise sauce with asparagus.  For dinner, I ordered scallops. I enjoyed my scallops but I enjoyed my friend's duck more.  Duck was cooked medium rare, it was so soft and tender...I almost wanted to say, can we switch?  For desert, I can't remember the name of my food but it was like chocolate mouse but not too sweet at all. I enjoyed my desert with macchiato.  Excellent service, the place was slightly tiny and I heard some conversation from our neighbors (I wasn't listening but I heard them talk, they were on the first date ), It was that close together..  They have nice patio and would love to come back on warmer night.  Definitely foodie heaven here and highly recommend.",

    "text": "Had a lovely evening with some friends at Virtu. The interior and exterior are very picturesque and the menu selections we had were fantastic.  We started with the asparagus and octopus appetizer. the octopus was very tender and beautifully presented. The asparagus was perfectly cooked with a great combination of textures and flavors.  We all each ordered a different protein dish and shared a bit of them with each other. Each person's entree was superb, well prepared, and flavorful. Out of all the dishes my favorite was probably the flat iron steak. It was perfectly medium rare, tender, and well seasoned.   My actual entree was a fish course which I unfortunately can't remember the name to (Started with an O), and was a white-fleshed fish. It was cooked perfectly with a crispy skin contrasting with soft, tender meat. It was beautifully presented and the sauce, prosciutto, and vegetables went well with the fish. It was a good portion of food (2 fillets). The only negative (And a big negative for me) was that I had a large, long bone in one of my fillets. If I am paying close to $30 for my entree of filleted fish you better get all the bones out!   Dessert was exquisite, and they even have affogato ($7) which was a heavenly mixture of hazelnut gelato with espresso.   Service was warm and friendly and our iced teas were refilled as needed. The waiter had excellent knowledge of the menu.  Overall it was a pleasant night and this is a great place for a date night or for a special occasion.",

    "text": "Virtu certainly has all the right pieces in place.  First the restaurant is beautiful and cozy and though a tad dark, is romantic and is decorated well - particularly on the patio.  It is very inviting as were the staff when we arrived.  I am familiar with the Virtu concept as we dine often in their sister restaurant Nico's Heirloom Kitchen in DT Gilbert.  Many of the food items are identical if not similar but our waiter was quick to point out that they changed their menu daily as opposed to Nico's who changed it much less frequently.  As we ordered drinks I was somewhat taken back by the wine glass prices.  Sitting between $14 to $17 a glass I ordered one of the two Pinot Noirs on the list to which the server responded that it was a feminine wine.  I've had Pinots be described as light bodied but never feminine but I understood what he meant and so I switched to the -cough- manly and more expensive PInot at $17.  If was OK but certainly average and served at what felt like warmer than room temp which was disappointing.      We also had a few mixed drinks which we found to be exceptional including the Amante Appassionato and their \"special G&T\".  Nice work from behind the bar at Virtu!  The waiter then took our order and stated that people usually order X number of sides and then an entree which just screamed to me as a bit of a transparent up sale.  I get the up sale working in the biz for over a decade and even helping guests with the menu but there is an art to it and this young waiter lacked the tact and polish needed to do it well. It came off snobby which did not sit well with me.    We ordered a few Burrata, Octopus, and Grilled Asparagus to share at the table before our entrees.  The Burrata was great and the the Octopus was a standout and amazingly tender.  If you don't like Octopus because of the texture you should try it here.  The Asparagus had a duck egg atop which I love but this egg had a very strong sulfur smell that was a turn off.  So much so that my buddy kept asking if there was a sewer gas issue to which I just kept silent on.     For an entree I ordered the duck which was well prepared and cooked to the right temperature but the flavors did not wow me.  My other friend ordered the last available portion of the scallops which had a very strong (bad) fishy smell to them.  I would have ordered them as well but was glad I didn't once I smelled them leaving me to wonder if they had sat around a day too long.   If I had never been to Nico's I would likely have enjoyed this more.  In the back of my mind I kept coming back to the fact that I was paying double to eat the same food I do in Gilbert just because I was in Scottsdale.  Perhaps worse I've never had anything suspect (scallops and duck egg) at Nico's ever.  I get that their rent and other expenses are higher but if you are going to charge that much you should distinguish it a bit more which they did not.  Our large party averaged out to $240 per couple even after keeping my drinks on the light side.  That combined with the over played up sale just pushed me to a 3-star for a likely 4-star joint.",

Served with a light and flavorful chili sauce and a bright, zesty simple salad for balance.  I forget what liquid they soak the octopus in, but it is soaked in something and wine corks are added to the liquid. This allows the meat to break down and become tenderized, resulting in a soft, buttery texture inside and a crispy, charred outside. Absolutely phenomenal.  James Beard nominee for best new restaurant and it definitely delivers.",

It's a new craft we're dining in And I just can see that half of us immersed in drinks Is all we have to give these stars  Foodies made of Virtu Honest Craftery now always seem to, be governed by this love I have For eating, drinking, of new ingredients Oh now there is no bounds for we all love restaurants  Virtu is was voted best new restaurant by Esquire earlier this year and one thing we know these days is we can trust the news!  Ummmm well, let's not jump the gun just yet and decide for ourselves.    I came here with a friend for restaurant week.  I ordered a drink and requested the bartender make it spicy since that's my new thing and he was happy to oblige.  Needless to say, I'm always appreciative of good service!  We began with appetizers; the Burrata and Polenta Board.  I took a bite of the Polenta Board my mate ordered and boy was it creamy and cheesy at the same time.  The braised pork atop gave it some extra sweet texture.  My Burrata was the similar I would say; creamy mozzarella ball cheese warm to the cut with prosciutto aside while what seems to be a balsamic reduction drizzled over it.  Overall an excellent start!  For our entree my mate ordered the Flat Iron Steak while I shot for the Seared Orata.  I'm not a big fan of steak in general, but this one in particular was well cooked and seasoned.  My star of the night was my Orata; the skin was crispy to every bite and the fish was still moist and tender.  The dates provided a hint of sourness and the pesto help with subtle sweetness.    In the end, Virtu definitely delivered to what they sell.  Being best new restaurant is a strong title and their food showed it.  Service was stellar and a must return for this chap! - Enjoy!",

As you walk into a gated entry surrounded by trees and a very romantic ambiance you are greeted to be seated either inside or outside in a very serene environment.  With birds chirping and a fountain in the back your eyes are led to the bicycles propped against the wall and the lovely space above for guests to stay the night.  The restaurant boasts of honest craft and they do just that.  I had the Polpo made with lemon marinated ceci, calabrese chile butter, rucola and fennel insalata, balsamico and to share my husband and I had the brown butter french toast made with noble bread, toffee, cinammon pears and marscapone.  He had the pork ragu with marscapone polenta, fried eggs, salsa verde and noble toast.  Each bite of our food was decadent and full of thought and flavor.  I would highly recommend having either brunch or dinner in this super cute establishment to set the tone for a wonderful day ahead.",

The ends were also too charred to really enjoy. The carbonara was excellent but a little too dense and heavy for my preference.  Wasn't a huge fan of their interpretation of the short ribs.

Grilled Octopus 5/5 - loved the taste and flavors  Asparagus 5/5 - tender asparagus  Duck 5/5 - so good! Loved the sauce that came with the duck. Skin was crispy and meat was tender. Enjoyed eating the accompanying Brussels sprouts.  Sticky toffee cake with salted caramel gelato 5/5 - WOW! One of the best desserts I've ever had. Apparently they put dates in the cake to keep it moist. Definitely a must try ;)",

The ambiance is very intimate and   The servers were very attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. The menu changes every once in a while but I ordered the famous Grilled Octopus (seems like a lot of people mentioned it in their reviews), brown butter french toast, chistorra and eggs and sticky toffee cake. There's really nothing I can say about them except YOU HAVE TO TRY THEM. It's literally heaven on earth. I would rate this place 6 out of 5 stars if I could...   Will definitely be back soon!",

It's kind of hidden out of the way from Old Town, and we eat here at least once every two weeks with friends. We always order the pork ragu and ask for a side of chorizo to put on top, the burger with the fried egg is phenomenal, the octopus salad with chickpeas is great..the cocktails are amazing. The setting is perfect and intimate. This is a hidden gem and I almost don't want to write the review in fear that it's going to not be so secret anymore - every time we bring friends they become obsessed. I took my girlfriend here for brunch on our first date - this place is probably why she's still with me!",

We split the octopus as an extra cus I've had it before and it's amazing. I got the dates as a first course and they had a unique caramel taste, served with charred rosemary that brought a nice aroma to the table. We both had the Orata and didn't regret it - perfectly seasoned, crispy skin, bright and light - also a big portion. The sticky toffee cake and affogato had more flavor then they had any right having. Other than the overpriced wine by the glass, the entire meal was exceptional.",

The Polpo appetizer our waiter recommended was great, so are the Anatra smoked duck entree and the Cappesante seared scallop entree. We also got the chestnut panna cotta seasonal desert because I love both panna cotta and chestnut, but never thought of combining them together. It came with a candle because we noted that it's a birthday dinner. Very happy with it. It was also on the house because of birthday reservation, although they did not tell us in advance. The parking in the area was not bad at all when we got there around 6pm Friday night.",

    "text": "Virtu is a very small restaurant that has won and been nominated for many awards. The daily changing menu is described as contemporary European with an Italian slant. You will be seated on the patio unless you specify to be indoors in your reservation. They are without a parking lot but you can park nearby with street parking or the lot that is basically across the street.  We were seated on the patio in the 93 degree heat at a wobbly table. Our waiter was able to fix the table but we were slightly uncomfortable in the heat.  We started with cocktails that were creative, interesting and contained ingredients I never heard of. The cocktails also tasted great BTW.  Our appetizers were Sicilian Rope Sausage and a salad. My salad was made of fresh micro greens, citrus and hazelnuts and contained a disk of goat cheese blended with beetroot. It was good but could have used a crouton or slice of bread to spread the cheese on. My husband said the rope sausage was good but the peppers and onions were a bit greasy.  For dinner I tried the Big Eye Tuna. The tuna was prepared reasonably well and was served as is over fried sun chokes in a sweet sauce. The sauce was suppose to be an agro dolce but I didn't get any sour just sweet.......It was cloyingly sweet but did have a sprinkle of sea salt and some Calabrian chili. I should have asked for a lemon to fix it but I wondered if it was just me so I asked my husband to try it and he said, \"I can't eat that..blah blah blah\"...I'm thinking I have more room for dessert now!  For dessert I had the Peaches and Cream Olive Oil Cake. Honestly after the sun chokes the dessert didn't seem sweet at all to me....  Didn't hit it out of the park for me this time.................maybe next time?",

It is literally one of my favorite 'foodie' places in the Valley, a James Beard Foundation Award Nominee, and a place that I ALWAYS tell people to go to because I know that they will not be disappointed. It is truly a hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale. From their amazing craft cocktails to their homemade pasta and insanely delicious/creative dishes, this place is a grand slam. They've literally got it all.   We went here for Easter Brunch and it was the best decision. My family was blown away with the atmosphere (love the rosemary and twine place settings), service, and creativity of the menu. We left with huge grins on our face!   I ordered the Virtu G+T (Their spin on a gin and tonic with thyme!). It is SO refreshing, I could drink it at any time of the day! I then ordered the simple salad which was light and perfect; the tomatoes were SO sweet and the lemon oregano dressing was tart and fab. For my main, I ordered the pork ragu that was served over creamy mascarpone polenta, fried eggs, salsa verde, and grilled toast. The polenta was so rich and seriously fantastic. I'm usually not the biggest polenta fan but this was not like your ordinary polenta (think mac & cheese GOOD). For dessert, we split their sticky chocolate toffee cake topped with salted caramel gelato (I have no words!), doughnuts with honey, and their butterscotch pudding.   This review is making me hungry, I want to do it all over again! Seriously, go HERE! You will NOT be disappointed.",

    "text": "What is it about Scottsdale that has become so unbearably pretentious?  Eateries that strive to be a place to be seen rather than a place to be admired for their extraordinary menu and service. These hip, trendy restaurants where rosemary (albeit wilted) is tucked into the napkin of your place setting and fortunes are spent on the coolest, hippest decor, yet when dinner's over you feel like you just came out of the big house... debased and violated. From first encounter this place screams one thing: Pretentiousness. I made a failed reservation through Open Table. No one cared. There were available tables everywhere. I know, I know they were reserved for \"the rush\" that was presumed to come later (that never came). We ate uncomfortably at the bar, (where ants in a single file line paraded to and fro. When we mentioned it, the bartender swiped them away with a towel and continued about his business), all the while staring at available tables. How many times have you been to a truly busy restaurant, where the maitre d (who gives a damn) says we have a table, but we need to have it back in an hour? Not the case here folks! Way too cool for that! Now let's move on to the menu... I paid $26 for a pasta dish that occupied approximately one eighth of my full size plate. Five dollars per noodle maybe? Quite frankly it should have been a side. One word: ridiculous. Furthermore it was just OK. The sea bream ($35) ... dry as a bone. The octopus was the best thing I tasted but don't waste a trip for it. What's more, the staff is robotic, void of any sense of customer satisfaction and plainly stuck up. Completing culinary school alone is not enough to carry a restaurant Virtu. Dining out should be an experience. One where every aspect should be pleasurable. Maybe you didn't realize this but you want to leave the customer with the desire to come back... which I'm sure you have deduced will never happen.",

    "text": "Our daughter gave us a gift certificate for this restaurant for our anniversary! She had done a lot of research since we are foodies. Either it was an off night in the kitchen or all the other people who gave this restaurant great reviews had very different food than us because it was a complete disappointment, and a do not go again situation for us. My husband ordered the Steak Tatar first and it was drowning in what he thought was soy sauce, salty and not good. I had the buffalo mozzarella that was prepared with honey, and served with a sweet brioche bread. It was incredibly sweet, in my estimation, too sweet, not good. We then went with a pasta dish for the second course: a fresh spaghetti with Fava beans and mint. It was a very small portion and truly unremarkable and bland. The main courses we ordered were the scallops and the pork. All the food was heavily salted, too much, in our estimation. The plate with scallops contained three scallops and was, again, over salted and expensive for the dish. My pork dish was large and overall it was tasty but not a memorable or an exciting dish. The bill was $200.00 for 2 people and not worth the money,(we only ordered one glass of wine each) I would never recommend this restaurant based on our experience. There are so many great restaurants in the local market that I am happy to pay that sort of money for a truly delicious meal....this unfortunately was not delicious. I really hate writing this sort of review because I appreciate and understand the effort that goes into creating a viable restaurant business....the worst part was having to tell our daughter that the food did not not meet anything close to her expectations or ours! I am truly sorry to have to write this....",

The scallop entree was perfectly done and the flat iron beef with an amazing rub and sauce couldn't have been better.  The affogato for desert was a perfect end to the most incredible meal.

The appetizer was delicious, our cocktails were strong and tasty, and my entree (the flank steak) was pretty solid. I wouldn't say amazing. I probably wouldn't order it again. But, for that moment in time, it did what it needed to do.  My only complaint? It's a weird one. I kept getting hit by water. I was very confused for the first ten minutes. I kept telling my girlfriend that it was raining and she thought I was crazy. At one one point a giant drop hit my right hand, and she saw it happen (thank god.) The waiter, walking by me, must have overheard me say something about it and he causally mentioned, as he continued to briskly walk by our table, \"there's a pool on the roof.\"  The couple next to us suddenly piped up, and told us that they too had been getting sprinkled with pool water all night.  When the pool water hit my dinner plate, I started to wonder, \"why aren't they telling people about this?\" I mean look, it's one thing to have a pool above your customers that's drizzling on them. It's another to ask \"inside or outside\" without casually mentioning, \"oh, the front row is in the Shamu splash zone.\" Just tell people, Virtu! That way we can make an informed decision.",

It was recommended by the waiter to come out medium rare but was served medium well even after I sent back to the kitchen and waited another 20 minutes for them to over cook it again. It was also served with a dry polenta cake that was lacking flavor. The funny part was no visit from management to the table. They took care of one of our appetizers and not the steak that was prepared incorrectly. Should have been awesome but missed the mark on the execution and recovery.",

    "text": "The husband and I went here for restaurant week last Friday and I must say that I was very impressed. I have been wanting to try this place for a long time, so when I saw their menu for RW I made a reservation right away. We started with a complimentary cocktail (mango sorbet in prosecco) and it was very tasty and refreshing. For appetizers, the husband got the lamb polpette with feta sauce... so delicious.. these little meatballs were packed with flavor, and I got the octopus panzanella. Now, I have had octopus before and didn't care for it, but I wanted to give it another chance. This was very good. The sauce they served it with and the herbs were wonderful! My only issue with the dish was that the bread was really tough and hard to cut (I ended up tearing it with my hands... not very lady like, but you gotta do what you gotta do). This octopus was far better than the first time I had tried it... I still don't think I am an octopus lover, but I did like it. For entrees, the husband got the pork chop and I had the steak. The pork chop was huge... I mean super huge. It was also tasty. He said it was was the best pork chop he'd ever had and, to quote him, it was 'comfort food elevated.' The steak was perfectly cooked and the chimichurri was delicious... very bright and herbacious. It came with a potato hash of sorts with a duck egg on top, cheese curds, and gravy.... sort of like a poutine. It was also amazingly delicious, but so rich I couldn't eat it all. For dessert we split the peanut butter and chocolate cake and the mascarpone ice cream with figs... the chocolate cake was a little on the dry side for me, but the ice cream was incredible... would eat that over and over! We also had coffee, and, though it was very good coffee, I wish we had gotten a refill.  I would definitely like to come back here again.   PS the service here was perfect, attentive, friendly, but not invasive... just great.   PPS you can tell how fancy a restaurant is by how many words in the review are underlined in red because the computer thinks they're spelled wrong... this place is pretty fancy :-P",

    "text": "A Manhattan cocktail typically has three ingredients. Virtu's has about thirty.  The list of ingredients read like a mystery novel, where the next ingredient was even more curious than the previous. I tried one out of pure, morbid curiosity. I was richly rewarded for the decision. There were so many flavors in this cocktail, my taste buds practically overdosed.  Virtu also features Menabrea beer, or more specifically, Menabrea Amber. If you've never had one, I strongly recommend it. This hard to find Italian IPA will pair beautifully with any meal, as if it was a fine wine. It's that good.  From the appetizers to desert, Virtu was delightful. The service, even better, making this restaurant every bit of five stars.  Grilled octopus, Branzino, and a custard-like desert were chart toppers.   I read some reviewers complain about the wine list being too abbreviated, the prices too high, and the meal selections limited. These are people who should not be Yelping since they're all very clearly full 'o shit.  Virtu is one of the few restaurants where the price is truly on par with the food. The service, adorns the food and drink experience like an expensive fashion accessory. And the ambiance whisks you away to Tuscany for the ninety minutes you're there.  I wasn't going to do this, write a review this favorable for fear I'll never get a seat again, but that would be wrong. Virtu deserves every accolade it gets. They've earned it.   At least me and the James Beard nomination committee think so anyway.",

When we arrived, there were only two other tables present, and we were still asked if we had a reservation. A little weird that no one answered the phone with only two tables. Suggestion- don't waste your time calling, just reserve to CYA on Open Table.  2. Morning cocktails are incredible. We ordered the bourbon drink and the gin drink. Deciding was challenging but the server was helpful.  If you like your drinks to be of a respectable caliber, this is your jam.   3. We ordered the burrata which was a great combination of flavors. Spicy poached eggs was next. If you have celiacs disease, I wouldn't even attempt to share this. We tried but my sad fork could barely scoop up any of the tomato egg goodness. Left this dish for the boyfriend to swoop in with beautifully toasted artisan bread slices.  Since I was still craving protein, we ordered the peperonata & potato hash.  This was incredible and left one measly bite of potato. Portions are a nice size and it is very fun to share.  The menu on the website is a sample-- really it shows the style of food you'll be treated to.",

That sealed the deal for me (when you see their prices on the menu you'll understand).  As it turns out I only had an appetizer and a drink (long, uninteresting story that has nothing to do with the restaurant).  But, what an appetizer!  We don't have a lot of octopuses (is that a cool word or what?) in the desert so you get one when you have the chance.  Virtu's grilled octopus with chickpeas is served with chili butter. There's a bit of a char but they are very tender.  My foodie friend insisted that I have their Let The Beet In cocktail along with the octopus because it complemented the dish (I told you he was a foodie). I guess he's right and frankly it's not the type of drink I would have ordered on my own.  It's made with salted beet syrup (I didn't know there was such a thing) with aquavit, mezcal and lime juice. It was very good.  Service was excellent and when it turned out we had to leave abruptly they were very gracious and understanding. I'll be back for a main course some day.",

    "text": "Virtu Honest Craft: appropriate name for the food, not the wine.    Went for dinner on a Sunday evening in July.  The food was excellent, the service was very good at the bar.  I had the squash flowers with goat cheese as an appetizer and the smoked duck entree - both were excellent.   The portions were just the right size  There is only one thing leading to a 3 star review - the wine prices.   The everyday selections cost about as much for a glass as the bottle's retail price.   Most inexpensive wines are marked up to about 4x retail pricing - this is not Honest wine pricing.  The best values on the wine list are some of the mid tier wines at a much more reasonable 2x markup (Gary Farrell Pinot Noir and Perrier Jouet bubbly for example).   But one shouldn't have to buy a $60+ bottle to be treated fairly.  I will get a beer next time.  If they fix the wine pricing, this becomes a 5 star restaurant.",

    "text": "I'm so happy to have finally gotten around to trying out this little gem of a restaurant. All of the good reviews here are spot on! The setting is so very charming...only a handful of small tables in this special little spot. There were outdoor tables as well. The service was great; very attentive but not over-bearing.  From the second we walked in the door, it was obvious that they were happy to have us in for the evening.   I appreciate the thoughtful approach to the menu....only a handful of items in each category. We had the octopus starter - PERFECTION on a plate....unbelievably tender, with just the right amount of char. Seriously, I should have ordered two of these (...next time I think we will!). The burrata platter was amazing...so very rich and delightful. Even the toasted/charred bread was delish! It comes with a roasted pepper, which at first I didn't see how they fit together, but turns out to work well. yum. We had a trio of the small plates: eggplant, steak tartar, croquette. The steak was our favorite. The eggplant was very good; just as the server described, it kinda has the flavors of pizza.  The croquette, while very yummy, seemed to be common. For dessert, we shared the butterscotch pudding....another perfectly executed dish! We sat at the bar, which was a treat in itself, the bartender was very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. He selected a really nice wine for me to enjoy with my dinner and I tried white port for the first time...such a nice suggestion!   Now, after this glowing review one may ask, \"why only four stars?\". Answer: It was LOUD. I'm not talking about \"noisy\", I mean \"can't hear yourself think\" loud.  We were initially seated at a two top, but decided to move to the bar because there was no way we would be able to hear each other talk at the table (as noted above, sitting at the bar turned out to be a great thing...). Apparently they usually keep the sliding doors open which helps, but on the night we were there, they had everything closed up due to weather. This is unfortunate as there is really nothing that can be done other than opening the doors. The only other tidbit is the lighting was too bright for my taste. Seems that it would have been so much more enjoyable to have the overhead lighting dimmed a bit and maybe more candle lighting....   With all that said, I already have plans to return (I will go in November when the doors are open).",

Probably the best Gin and tonic I've ever had. My husband, the whiskey drinker, enjoyed all of Joshua's drink recommendations as well.  The food also delicious. We shared  a bread plate, the octopus (a must) and the pork with seasonal veggies. Dessert was a chocolate cake with butterscotch and vanilla ice cream. Everything perfect. We will be back for another drink sooner than later! I  deducted one star because we couldn't get a table.

My husband and I treated ourselves to dinner here last night for our anniversary, after we saw the chef doing a demonstration at AJ's a year ago. Our waiter Scott was top notch, explained all of the dishes extremely well.  They do a great job with the craft mixers..we started with one of those and then went on to a fab bottle of Frank Cab to enjoy the appetizers with.  They have 7 or 8 small tapas to start with and we tried 4 of them. All of them excellent!  The next dish we had was the grilled octopus which I believed is shipped in from Spain.  Never had this tasty of octopus and it was a full dish.  Next course was the main course and hubs had the smoked duck and I enjoyed the buccatini pasta.  Not big plates but enough to satisfy any food cravings.   The establishment is small, very intimate and bar seating is limited so get there early if you want a seat at the bar.  This was a Wednesday night and we had reservations and each table was taken 6pm. When the weather is cooler there is outdoor patio seating as well.  The Bespoke Inn is upstairs and they are closed for the summer but open most of the year. We loved this place and can't wait to come back!",

Food is pricey, taste is nothing to shout about...  3. Portion is small!!! I have ordered scallop entree and there were ONLY 3 scallop in my plates and it costs $30. I would rather enjoy my scallop meal at North, Common Kierland.  4. The restaurant is small. No privacy. The only 1 star that I could give is the service. Service is good.  This would be my first and last visit of this restaurant. Simply not worth for the money that we spent! How it got rated no. 1 restaurant in Scottsdale? I think it is just because of the marketing !!
