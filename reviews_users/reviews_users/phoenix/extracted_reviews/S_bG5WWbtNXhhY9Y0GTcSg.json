Prices were a little more than I would have liked but you are paying for high quality ingredients.  I had the chicken pesto sandwich with the side salad. The pesto was to die for and the chicken was really fresh and shaved thin.",

Their food is great, the tea is perfect---and the coffee use to be the best in downtown Phoenix. I sincerely hope Fame looks into this issue to see what things changed recently!! Also, I cannot for the life of me understand why they don't open until 7am. They serve coffee yet I'd venture to say they are losing out on a lot of potential revenue by not being open earlier...and not staying open later.",

Such a cozy little spot to do work or even homework since they have complimentary wifi. Now, back to the food. Breakfast is on point, their french toast is the best french toast in Arizona by far. They have generous portions and the fact that they changed their menu in order to personalize it to the costumers liking is great! You feel at home the moment you walk in through the door, I definitely recommend.",

Came here around 10 on a Sunday morning and we didn't have too wait long for our food! You walk in and order and then find a seat and they bring the food to you. I ordered a daily special which was eggs benedict. Sooooo good! I thought it beat Snooze. The sauce was different, it tasted amazing though. The dish was amazing and just the right amount to fill me up which was perfect! My hubby got the breakfast wrap which basically seemed like a breakfast burrito. He got it with chorizo and it came with this bomb salsa! Definitely a good size as well. For the price not only are you getting amazing food, but a good serving, too. Overall, cute little place. Glad we finally were able to try it! Oh, and they have a bar! So if you're looking to have a mimosa or something, they've got you covered :) Looked like a full bar. Five stars all the way! Thanks Fame, can't wait to come back!",

As soon as I walked in, it was a familiar feeling of, the currently trendy style, hipster health food food grub joint.  Wood walls with stainless steel tables garnished with a tin bucket with eating utensils and napkins and a small base with pastel colored plants. It is always nice to dine in such a relaxing environment. There is indoor and outdoor seating, so you can choose either or.  The food was overall \"just good.\" I had the chicken pesto sandwich but the chicken was quite dry and I don't feel that the pesto was all that particularly great. But... You can get a side of salad or Fries and I got the fries. The fries were a hearty amount and definitely filled me up. Again, the fries were just the same 'ol same 'ol fries, nothing special.",

    "text": "Parking: Eyyyyy not so bad, plenty of parking. In the hope your kids do not read the sign of those special kakes next door out loud...lol  Entrance: I notice they have tables and chairs outside, along side with a couple of doggie water bowls. Assuming, its \"Pet Friendly\" makes it a homie place to grab a bite to eat.  Inside the restaurant:  We walk in and there's not much to know whether someone is going to seat you or you seat yourself until you stand for a moment watching others. The ahh hah light bulb comes in and you notice you order your food, take a number, and have a seat. Off to the right, you'll notice the different types of coffee on the menu and in the middle there is a cash register. Behind the cash register at the top of the wall is the food menu.   The Food: I order the Croquet Monsieur and the Mocha Iced Coffee. It didn't take too long for our order to come out. The aged cheddar that the menu claims this good Croquet has, is what drew me to order it. As it sat on my table I tried to determine whether I had an omelet or a melted cheddar covered sandwich. Well it was the sandwich with flavorful cheese and ham melted inside. I never had one but I have to say I loved every bite of it. I noticed a side of greens to it and decide to dip into that with a fork. Had a bit of a salt flavor with some kind of Italian or vinaigrette dressing. I'm not a fan of salads but I ate it all. Sisters boyfriend asked if I'd like to try some of the french toast he ordered. Well that was a shocker, I tried it, seem to be a possible normal french toast, except that citrus flavor came out. I would have never thought the two would work, but wow, that was good. I'll have to get that next time. Good job whoever invented that one.  The Ending and Why not a 5: They do have waiters come around from time to time to see if anything else is needed, so they don't just leave you to the tables, don't worry. I would have given it a full 5 but it's not a location near me. Also, the food is excellent but it's something I would have to of grown up on. If it was chicken fried stick and eggs, would go back more than once a month. This could be a new entry for breakfast for me, maybe at some point it could hit the home cooking gut and make a 5. Keep up the excellent above average service and food, you guys are bringing something very different to the breakfast table. Everyone can appreciate that.",

I had the short rib sandwich.  It to was just bland.  The short ribs really didn't have any flavor other that of cooked beef.  I chose a side order of fries which unfortunately were raw.

(sorry no pic) The black beans looked like they had been pureed. Everything on his plate looked spilled out and awful. No potatoes with it either or meat. I ordered the Dos which I'm pretty sure was supposed to come with potatoes but I guess not. My eggs were ok, pretty bland. The toast was super hard, the crust actually hurt the roof of my mouth. The jam for my super hard toast was strange. Honestly my first thought was \"why did they give me bbq sauce?\".  I ordered a separate side of bacon. The bacon was pretty good. Needless to say, we both left pretty hungry. Oh and they don't have regular tea, only flavored tea which I'm not a fan of. And the girl that took our order looked like she would have rather been at home sleeping and seemed a little annoyed when I asked if they had plain iced tea.  Watching the cops arrest a homeless guy across the street was pretty entertaining. And also the crazy guy talking to himself walk down the street was fun as well. Gotta love what the lightrail brings around.  Now, the good... the decor was great. I loved the planter boxes out front. The light fixtures were great. The tables were nice. And I especially loved the big railroad wood with the lighting wrapped around it. BUT, I don't go somewhere to eat just because it looks nice on the inside. Long story short, we wont' return. :/",

Oh don't forget to ask for a side of the red homemade salsa. It was the perfect topping to my scramble. There is an extra charge for it (weird) but the few cents it cost was worth it. The one thing I didn't care for is the fact that they allowed a dog inside. It didn't look like a service dog. There is patio seating and plenty available at the time. Why not ask that patron to sit in the patio with his dog?? There's a line to all this attachment to pets and I think a restaurant should keep it sanitary by keeping pets outdoors. Had I not seen a dog being  allowed inside the restaurant, this place would have a received a 5 star rating from me for sure! Good stuff!!",

Hubby enjoyed a chilaquiles skillet. In fact, he enjoyed it so much that he bought a bottle of their house hot sauce. Our daughter loves French Toast so in her honor I ordered that dish. The bread was crispy on the outside and not gooey on the inside. Berries accompanied the dish. Of course I had to send a pic of my breakfast to you know who.  The tab for breakfast with coffee and ice tea was $26.",

The atmosphere is really cute and cozy, and they made us feel very welcome. They answered all of my questions about their menu items and accommodated my cravings for something unique.   I ordered the special of the day with a few changes, which was essentially prosciutto toast and jam with a soft and creamy cheese. It came with a refreshing side salad. My girlfriend ordered the quiche of the day with a side salad, and said it was lovely.   This is a nice place to sit and chat while enjoying a casual brunch or lunch.

As I left, however, it started to get really busy. I'd recommend coming before 9am if possible. There is free parking, but I think it could get filled up quickly during peak business hours.   I had the breakfast wrap with chorizo and it was delicious!! The orange juice was really good as well. The cashier who took our order was very friendly and had some great suggestions for what food to order. The food came very quickly and was hot and fresh. Great quality ingredients, especially in the orange juice. If I'm ever in Phoenix again I will definitely come here again.",

On subsequent visits, I got my sammie with an over easy egg and various types of toast....MUCH better. Also, last time I went, they threw on some avocado.... even better!

I got french toast, a side of bacon, and an iced horchata latte. I wasn't expecting  much for the french toast (it was just plain with syrup and berries) and was a little disappointed that there weren't any of the typical decadent options like a lot of breakfast places have (you know what I mean - stuffed and drizzled and chocolate covered, etc. etc). I was blown away though, it was plain but it was so perfect it didn't need any fancy toppings or fillings! Perfectly crisp and just rich enough. The bacon was spot on as well - not too crisp, but not soggy. The horchata latte was awesome, neat idea. I love the casual modern hipster-ish feel of the decor and the drinks in mason jars were cute. Additionally, I was expecting to wait a long time for food based on how packed it was but our food came in less than 10 minutes! I will definitely be back!",

I opted for a Mimosa and the French toast and sausage. Definitely farm to table is correct. A generous portion of French toast, with fresh berries and delicious syrup. The sausage was in a nice casing that popped when you cut into it.  The Mimosa was great accompaniment to the meal.  Great customer service and prices that can't beat.",

Decided I wanted breakfast for lunch (breakfast served all day) and got pancakes, side of sausage and a small iced latte. Though price point is a bit steep here, the quality of food and service is spot on. The pancakes were perfect and my ideal pancake! Three, thick, fluffy with a slight crisp edge and a lovely buttery flavor. Served with maple syrup and of course I got a little more butter on the side. I did not find the sausage to be fitting for the price $3 for a sausage link cut in half, it was definitely different from a typical uncased breakfast sausage and more akin to a Chinese Sausage in texture and milder in flavor. The latte was pretty good as well.  Service here makes you feel appreciated and welcome with constant checking in and greetings. Great food and solid coffee! I'm kicking myself because I want to try more of their breakfast menu, definitely drawn in at this point. Plus, for them to understand that breakfast any time of day is appropriate are people who know what they're doing! Haha! They serve more than just breakfast, they serve sandwiches, juices, pastries and coffee. Wi-Fi is decent here and outlets are located along the perimeter of the cafe except for at the patio/bar area. Can't wait to be back!",

I couldn't wait to taste everything on the menu.....  First things first.....you have place an order before you can be seated so if your going to have a large group you need to have someone get there early to place everyone's order.   As our group trickled in each one of us had to wait in line to place an order. We had a nice waitress who let all of us be seated as she took our orders...  Let's get to the food...... aghhhhhhhh I wanted to love this place, I really did..... but when I ordered the Huevos Rancheros... it was a soupy mess. Look I get it.... everything is organic. I love organic but I know organic taste good. This didn't taste remotely good. It was bland and the tortillas were hard and cold. The egg was cold!! I  hate hate, hate cold eggs.....   Still hungry I reached over to my girlfriends plate to try her French toast..... what the @%#%...it was dry..... DID I CRACK A TOOTH....  I took one for the team and didn't complain....I just continued to eat hoping it would get better.   As I'm washing down this meal with an blood orange mimosa which by the way was so tart everyone on the table had to add a package of sugar to it. YES....THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE THAT I EVER HAD TO ADD A PACKET OF SUGAR TO A MIMOSA!!!  Okay..... so the vanilla honey latte was amazing and so was the bacon.    I actually place another order for bacon.....  Look people love this place.... maybe it was a bad day considering it was pouring outside.   Food should make you feel good and warm your soul....  Fame just didn't do it for me.... a quick latte, a muffin and scone. I'll show up but for brunch I'll pass....",

They have the best pancakes in town, light and fluffy served with real maple syrup, a mean breakfast burrito and their sandwiches use noble bread which they also sell as loaf on Saturday and Wednesday.  Wash all this down with a fresh fruit juice or a cup of coffee you will come out of that brunch feeling quite satisfied.  The service is always friendly not a fan of the queuing process to order food they are staffed enough to serve at the table but if you keep clear of the extra busy hours it's not too bad.

It isn't the closest shop to me, but it's quickly become my favorite. They have delicious (slightly over priced) breakfast and lunch. The chicken pesto sandwich is my go too. As well as a bar with breakfast cocktails, beer, and probably more if I was a bit more observant. Overall awesome place, 100 percent would recommend!",

    "text": "The essence of brunch is rooted in relaxation and escape, you've worked long all week and you just need to, as Tom Haverford and Donna would say on Parks and Rec: \"Treat yo self\". But recently brunch has become a fight-for-your-right to that semi-early escape - becoming a stressor in itself, waiting anxiously and impatiently (sometimes, if not always, in the heat) for delicious food. Fame can be brunch without the drama.  I walked right up to a counter, ordered the Croque Madam, and after a reasonable amount of time, enjoyed my ham-gouda-sunny side up sandwich with the breeze of the rare and coveted 75 degree weather in my face. My only complaint was the gouda was slightly burnt and the prices are a bit high but paired with the delicious Toddy iced coffee, I didn't mind too much.  I've always passed Fame because it is within walking distance of Lux, a nearby cafe that's a popular spot to work and hang out; with a crowded hipster vibe I try to frequent it on an as-needed basis only. By contrast, Fame is a nice alternative, it seeks to provide a relaxed yet sophisticated atmosphere where you can enjoy good food and drinks without the worry. Could this be a Phoenix cafe rivalry in the making? Oh yeah!",

I really didn't know what to expect before going so the first thing I asked the wonderful young lady who would take my order was what she suggested. I decided her recommendation of the Vegetable Frittata would do the trick. And boy did it! At first I feared I might be hungry after I had completed my meal but the opposite occurred.  The outstanding frittata didn't hold anything back in the vegetable department! Every bite was full of flavorful veggie goodness. (And try a bit of their homemade hot sauce if you want a kick!) It came with two slices of toast and roasted rosemary potatoes to round out the meal. I was full for hours after! My dining companion had the breakfast burrito and had the same fear I had...not enough food. Her meal was the burrito only, no sides. She admitted that she, too, was full. I tried a bite of her meal and will order that when I return. The vibe seems like it would lean young but there were people of all age groups enjoying their time there. It's on the small side but seating was readily available. You would think it would be loud but having a private conversation was a cinch. It is out of my way, but I will gladly make the drive again to try a new dish!",

Feel free to read the rest of the fame story online. We're here to talk about food! And damn, the the french toast was delicious on multiple levels. I had their frenchie toast [vg] \"pain perdu\" style + berries + 100% real maple syrup ... which is pretty much a really long way of saying, \"Damn! This sh** is good!\"  To add a little bit of salt to my pallet, I opted for the side of country sausage, which was savory. Every bite made a crisp snapping sound followed by an eruption of savory flavor in my mouth.  So, if you ever find yourself tired of waiting at Lux down the way, swing in. Place your order. Grab a sit (feel free to color on the table top butcher palate). And enjoy a passionately sourced meal ;)",

Service was quick and the staff were friendly and efficient.   The reason for only three stars is, the food was just meh. Not awful, but just nothing special and not too flavorful. Husband got the breakfast sandwich without cheese or meat; added avocado. I had the avocado toast; added tomatoes and egg. I had asked for an egg with the white cooked and the yellow runny. The girl taking my order said, \"Oh, that's our over medium.\" Unfortunately it was over cooked; the yolk was not runny. Disappointing.  We shared the potatoes and they were delicious.  We also bought slices of banana bread and ate it this morning at home. It was very good.   This was our second time here; we ordered something different last time and it was just okay also. We will continue looking for a favorite breakfast restaurant.",

    "text": "This is the third time I've been to Fame Caffe and I must say, it deserves more stars than I originally wrote. I wanted to have a healthy breakfast for a change, so I ordered the avocado toast (with bacon of course, can't be TOO healthy) and I was pleasantly surprised. It was seasoned well, with a great lemon-y taste. The sesame seeds and the micro cilantro complemented it well. I  would have preferred for the bread to be toasted though.   They are a variety of choices to choose from on the menu, from healthy choices like the veggie scramble to the breakfast wrap which consisted of mexican chorizo (the server recommended this). I ordered a caramel latte. It was good and strong without being too sweet. Fame could get a little pricey - I spent $14 without tip for a small avocado toast and iced coffee.   I absolutely love the ambiance of this restaurant. It is straight out of an HGTV episode; it looked like a place Chip and Joanna Gaines built, with the farmhouse/modern feel. Up on the ceiling are egg crates which gives the place some charm. I will for sure be back!",

It's a beautifully decorated restaurant where you order up front and find a table to sit at. If it's busy, someone will come up to ask how many people are in your party and they'll get a table for you.  I tried the frenchie toast (highly recommend this), avocado toast with bacon, and Parisian omelet. All were really good, but the French toast was amazing. It's crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. It comes with berries on top and doesn't need too much maple syrup. My next fave was the Parisian omelet - def recommend if you're looking for something light to eat.  Some standouts that my friends ordered: croque madame, oatmeal, breakfast wrap. They said the chorizo was delicious.   Note: their hot sauce has a kick to it!  I honestly wish that I had this place in the Bay Area. It's soooo good!",

I wasn't aware that it was stuffed with meat and cheese; I actually thought it was mostly going to be toast.  Glad I tried it.  I also got the breakfast wrap with chorizo.  Nice spices without being overwhelming, melted cheese, and a soft tortilla that's chewy (not like the thin dry bread wraps).  It comes with blended salsa that you can pour on top.  Easy enough place to find, ice water dispenser, good parking, casual atmosphere.  The total for 2 breakfasts and a drink was about $22.  One thing they might want to change is the ordering process.  There's just one cashier and all orders are placed at front counter right after you walk in.    The ladies before me wanted to sample tea before buying, then when I was up, I had a couple of questions about the menu that slowed things down as well.  The people behind us just had to wait.    Also....my apologies, but I just realized that I didn't leave a tip.  I paid at the counter and planned on leaving a tip on the table, but since the service is just food drop off I just completely forgot by the time I was done.  Anyway, it wasn't because I didn't enjoy the meal.",

I have also tried the Nutella pancakes and the French toast...all so delicious and very memorable. On the second time I was here I was in line for the bathroom and was coughing, and the owner took the time to ask if I was ok and asked if he could bring me water. He was such a gentleman and so genuine. I brought my family here on my last visit from Chicago and they couldn't stop talking about it. Fa'me is my new favorite. It is worth the drive!",

The last had the heirloom tomato (caprese) salad topped with bright flowers.   The high point aside from the great flavor and freshness was the presentation. One wouldn't expect it from such a casual affair (which has high rolling lawyers and even the Mayor of Phoenix dining on occasion.)  The low point is the portion size which isn't huge but don't let this deter you because where quantity only slightly lacks, the quality makes up for it quickly.   The owner is a super genuine and nice guy and the staff is happy to help and informative. One of the best local spots we've been to in a while.",

Passes the time while waiting for your food to come out. However, I will say make your food choice wisely. I got the breakfast sandwich and my girlfriend got the chorizo breakfast burrito and I instantly realized I made the biggest mistake of my life when they brought our food out. The burrito was massive and super tasty and took both hands to hold. The breakfast sandwich was sub par and only took one to hold and it was a bit on the bland side. Some hot sauce pepped it up a bit though. I would definitely come back, but I would definitely order something else. Oh and the pancakes are massive too and take up an entire plate and so light and fluffy.",

It's also one of the few places that serve real maple syrup by default. The bacon is also crack - must be slightly candied. It's a super comfortable place to have breakfast/lunch or a meeting for freelancers (there were a TON of people on their computers). Cons: Ok. The service sucks. I think they mean well, but they don't think. I came in with my baby and all my hands full when they handed me a drink, my credit card back, a giant block number for my order then told me yes - you can get water yourself over there and the high chairs are there too. Really?? And this was at 2pm. It was not busy at all. It left me rather irritated. I get that this doesn't really define totally crappy service, but it sure separates you from amazing service.",

Great location - we can walk across the street from St. Francis, and you're close to some other cute businesses. A pretty varied menu, including lots of hot and cold options. We liked everything we tried: chorizo burrito, breakfast sandwich, yogurt & granola bowl, pastries, and French toast. I love that they sell mimosas and bloody Mary's. Prices are pretty reasonable. One complaint: they don't really have specialty tea drinks for us non-coffee drinkers. They were nice enough to make us tea lattes, even though it wasn't on the menu, but they weren't great. To coffee shops everywhere: please start making matcha drinks! Even with that, I'll happily go back to Fame again and again.",

    "text": "It is a quiet winter morning on a weekend in the desert. The sun outside unfolds through hints of cloud and crisp, refreshing air. Before me rests a mug, two books, a pen. Lifting my eyes, a window opens out to frame the waking human world with all its anxious human pulse.  Service here is slow, but not unkind. I blame it on the numbers in this spacious public house - we the crowd of hungry/thirsty travelers, we the sound of words and thoughts that fill it to the rafters. Twisting my neck I see that nearly every seat is filled.  Before too long a plate of food arrives and perches just beside me to the left. On it rests an omelet, a clutch of moist potatoes, and reclining halves of toast. A thin film of steam arises from the egg as from my mug. Breathing through the nose, I almost taste it.  Visitors shift past me as I slowly raise a bite. A body ruffles edges of the jacket on my back in apologetic passing. The omelet neatly cut now offers view of steaming contents: wet strings of melted cheese, warm squares of tomato, folded egg, and pebbled scallions.  The first bite to the last is wrapped in silence, slow breathing, an unpredicted hum of satisfaction. Alternating samples of the toast prove omelet's equal. Another sip of coffee. A stranger exits, smiling. Soon the plate is empty but for scraps.  BACKGROUND  Fame Caffe has been calling to me for well over a year now. Sadly, our schedules have refused to sync up until today. I entered Fame with more than a years' worth of pent up anticipation, and left without the meagerest complaint.  Everything from atmosphere to service to the food was registered a win. In passing, the Caffe seems small and unassuming. Upon entrance, one can't help but be impressed by use of space. Tall ceilings, plentiful seating, and a healthy hum of activity draws you in.  The menu is surprisingly extensive with primarily health-conscious options. The food does not disappoint. Somewhat restricted hours equal longer lines and greater congestion than other options, but the experience of this place is distinctly worth the wait.  Fame inspires a sense of community and of awareness. Come prepared to stay a little while. Come prepared to eat healthy for a fair price. But do come. You won't be disappointed. I know I'll be back - my spirit and my taste buds have assured me.  ;)  IMPORTANT NOTE  I have confirmed that Fame is, in fact, pronounced Fah-May. This was a source of some confusion for me up until this morning.  CONCLUSION  Don't miss this hidden gem. Check the hours, work out the scheduling of it, then come by for some really great eats and an inspiring ambiance. The team will likely be busy attending to guests, but they'll be sure to make you feel at home.  Fame Caffe Crew: thank you for the hard work you put in every day. Thank you for the outstanding food and wonderful service, and for creating such a beautiful space and spirit. It's noticed, and it's appreciated. I hope to see you all again very very soon.  :)",

She said, better than Chelsie's Kitchen. A creature of habit, so it's a big complement. We chatted with both owners at the bar, met another couple that comes here \"every Sunday.\" So a truly neighborhood feel. Oh, and the food came out super fast, not that we were in a hurry. We lingered for a while just because it was cool chatting with the owners, trying an artisanal Mexican beer and learning that they plan to open for dinner soon. Maybe tapas or paella?

We went in ordered and the counter. took a number, had a seat and shortly later had a most enjoyable meal!  I had the grapefruit based Aqua Fresca and it was so refreshing!   The Croque Madame had the most amazing crusty bread, smothered in a delightful thinly sliced delectable ham and the cheese.... so freaking good! The Egg on top; made my mouth curtsy!!!!!!  We will definitely be back! I didn't realize this lil gem was hiding in my neighborhood less thana mile from my house! dangerous for my wallet and my waistline!",

Having a pretty sensitive diet has been difficult to deal with while both traveling and going out to eat. The two ladies that went through the entire menu with me this morning singlehandedly improved my trip to visit my family. I appreciate the time they took to help me find vegan breakfast options!   The food was fresh and very flavorful. The sauteed veggies I got were amazing and reminded me of the farm fresh dishes I make back home in Portland. My mom mentioned the French Toast being unique in an unexpected manner, but tasty nonetheless.   As far as the atmosphere goes, fantastic job guys. Such an adorable place. I'd definitely be a regular here if I still lived in the state.",

They have an indoor/outdoor bar that lines the restaurant for couples like me and my boyfriend AKA me always cold and he's warm enough to sit outside with the dog. Yes, dog friendly! They have little treats that are made by KAK and my dog ate those all up (but he'd probably eat anything). There are also full tables outside.  Their staff was fantastic -- Super friendly and professional. They were great to our pup and were quick to clean up any plates. They were extremely helpful and offered great suggestions.  I ordered an Iced Coffee which was not watered down and they were able to add some flavors of my choice. My boyfriend ordered the cafe con leche, one of his favorites and he highly suggests you try it.   My favorite part was the food. I ordered a side of tender belly bacon and their French toast. Their French toast is made on thick bread served with delicious maple syrup.  Some of this and a side of Tender Belly bacon, you are set to tackle the world. Their bacon was perfectly cooked, and I am actually drooling thinking about this meal.",

    "text": "Met some friends and clients there for brunch today, having never been there but they had highly suggested it, having been there prior.   One walks in, and I see it is not a regular sit down and get served kind of place.   Instead, one stands in line, peer at the board with the menu, orders, and the food is brought to the table.   The staff is very friendly and efficient.   I was thinking of having something like the french toast or pancakes, but decided on something healthier.   I ordered the huevos rancheros, deciding to give it a try, as opposed to the omelet, especially since the omelet comes with three eggs versus the huevos rancheros comes with two.   I supposed I could have ordered an omelet with two eggs, thinking back. ...   Oh, well.   Next time.  ...  My friends suggested the croquet madame and the croquet monsieur.   Since I'm not really fond of bread, decided against it, albeit they ordered it and both dishes looked good.   One friend ordered the avocado toast, which had a HUGE half of an avocado on toast.   I really didn't know avocados were that large!  She ordered an egg to top it.  Another person ordered a breakfast sandwich and I can't remember what everyone else ordered.   Everything looked great, though.   My huevos rancheros came with two eggs atop a tortilla with black beans.  It was good, albeit I am not a fan of corn tortillas either.   I think it would have been better with maybe a flour tortilla on the side, especially since I like flour tortillas much better than the corn.   It was the right mix of flavors, seems somewhat healthy, not overly large so one walks out of the restaurant stuffed.   It must be unlimited coffee since one can refill ones cup till. ...  I do see they have wi fi, and I might go back to try maybe some of the potato dishes as well as maybe an omelet or the pancakes or French toast.   It is not so noisy that one cannot have a conversation.   The food is fairly inexpensive, most of the dishes are $8-$9.  It is right on Central Ave., and one can easily hop on and off the light rail.   Next to a bunch of other restaurants that I've been, whether for happy hour, dinner, lunch; therefore, convenient location.   It is only open till 3:00, therefore, good for breakfast or lunch.   Yes, I would definitely return. ...",

I'm not a big fan of sweet citrus flavors or pastries so it wasn't my favorite. Place was very busy and noisy , it was hard to have a conversation with my friend in front of me.

Sadly though, I'm a foodie not a drinkie, and as such, I will not be eating here ever again. I had the standard pancakes. Which I know, isnt exciting but since its generic you'd think they couldn't mess it up, but they did. I don't know what was in my pancakes that made it taste like cardboard but it did. I know that pancakes aren't supposed to be singing with The Sound of Music flavor but they also aren't supposed to taste like that 5am class you thought was a good idea. Potatoes were fairly tree like. It reminded me of driving through Flagstaff on a rainy day... which I'm not sure if you can imagine that in a potato but that's the closest I can get to describing them. My husband got the much revered frenchie toast, which he was so excited by, only to sadly force himself to eat because he paid for it. I have never seen my husband eat something out of stubbornness until that day and it made me sad to see him not enjoy his food. The place itself is super cute. Community like open seating and very modern. Definitely clean. But I can say, unless I'm in the area again and have time to walk in to get a chai tea to go, I will not be coming back.",

The omelet was fluffy but packed with tons of cheese. However it seemed to be enjoyed.   I took away a star based on portions to price. The toast about 8 dollars and it was the smallest piece of toast I've seen! I was still so hungry after, I would recommend getting a side along. I should have also purchased a pancake. Otherwise, it was a great order at the counter and sit Location. Very friendly staff as well.",

Ahhh man, I could gain a lot of pounds, forgo my low carb days and eat this up everyday! It's so good! It's unassuming, arriving on a plate simply dressed with a few sliced berries, a side of real maple syrup, then it happens, your knife and fork slice into it, and it enters your mouth and your brain freaks out, telling your hands to cut another bite as fast as you can!! It's seriously so delicious! My son, shared a bite of his Avocado Toast, it equally elevated my senses. It was so fresh, and full of flavor, the lemon zest was a nice touch!  Our table ordered a side of thick cut bacon, pancakes, croquet madame, and a egg sandwich, all were exceptional!  This place gets very busy on the weekends, plan to be patient, hang in there, and wait! It's worth it.  They serve up cocktails, a big bonus! The Bloody Mary, was one of the best tasting I've ever had! Coffee is great!  I thought I had my favorite breakfast place,(Vovomeena).....I'm not cheating on you, you're really good, but ahhhh Fame, you win! You're just too good all around!  Sorry I didn't take pictures,.... it was a rare moment, we all devoured, and I didn't care! I just wanted to eat! Pictures next time:)",

Same goes for their Parisian omelet which sounds very basic in its description but the umami of the mushrooms combined w the subtle sweetness of the onions and the gruyere cheese makes for an incredible omelet. Oh and their breakfast burrito is B-O-M-B. Not all breakfast burritos are the same. Try it w their green salsa.   Also tried my sister's French toast. Also extremely yummy but their savory dishes are ridiculously good. Try them and tell me I'm wrong",

I'm going to enjoy the food and I am not going to enjoy ordering my food.   While wait staff, managers and everyone else is friendly and outgoing, the people taking your order at the counter and the coffee barista will make me feel like I am bothering them and I am stupid.  Basic questions either go unanswered or are answered with attitude.    Overall that brief experience at the counter is no reason not to come to this restaurant.

I was super impressed with my simple meal. The staff was incredibly helpful and sweet. The decor is beautiful, bright, and rustic. In fact, I just returned from a month long trip in Mexico City where I ate at some of the best cafes. I was a little sad to leave them behind knowing I would not find such places on every corner of Phoenix. I found the essence of some of those cafes in Fame Caffe, so thank you! The black and white back splash behind the counter was super tasteful, and added an art-deco element of design again the modern, rustic decor (similar to what I saw abroad).   Back to the food though...  I bought a scone because I thought, why not? I'm here for coffee, yada yada yada. The moment I bit into the cranberry scone, I knew I had to come back for more. It was fresh, flavorful, and hands down muy rico! The espresso was absolutely delightful, and presented exactly how I would order it from the cafes in Mexico City.   Coming here was just what I needed as I was coming off my post-vacation blues. Great service, quality food, and damn good espresso. I'm coming back for brunch, and I'm a woman of habit so you will probably see me often.",

Usually delivery from a cafe isn't the most thrilling, but Fame did a lovely job. Everything was packaged beautifully and my order was perfect. I finally got to go and really enjoy everything Fame has to offer recently (normally I just grab and go or order delivery). The patio is lovely and the food is even better when you stay in and eat. I'm looking forward to bringing my fiance here one weekend soon. Fame is the  perfect spot for excellent food and diving  into a new book.",

Nice size space and interior. Staff was friendly and cheerful. Restroom was very clean and private.   I went early, 8am on a Sat and since it's self seating and lots of space I didn't feel like I was holding up a table too long while I wrote out some postcards.   Was a perfect beginning to my day",

The grill cheese connected the two pieces of bread, and blended well with the butter on the bread. The side salad with the dish was very fresh and balanced the dish very well. It was so yummy! The mimosa was ok, nothing as outstanding as the bread. I went at around 2pm on a Sunday, so there were many empty tables. Good place to chill and work in the afternoon when it's not too busy. Cute place and I will definitely go bk and share more photos later!",

The natural light makes the interior enjoyable to be in. I have come here for lunch the past 2 days due to the high quality food they have to offer. The presentation of the food itself could make a sardine look like a prime rib. The food ( especially the breakfast ) is truly appetizing. I personally have ordered the huevos rancheros and the fame omelet.  The huevos rancheros were way better than a regular huevos rancheros because of this ingredient that I can not name, but it is like a cheese substance that was amazing. The omelet was a good omelet. Nothing special, but really hit the spot. Overall amazing restaurant. My only criticism is that the water cups are very small so you are forced to refill them yourself 4-5 times a meal.",

I keep looking for a new breakfast place that satisfies...this could have been it, but it seems to substitute style over substance.  Hubby had veggie scramble...okay but truly no big deal. Portions are on the small side...great place to not over eat! You won't finding yourself asking for a to-go box for any leftovers. The two eggs, bacon or sausage and potatoes option (\"Dos\") doesn't include toast! At $8.25 you have to pay $1.25 extra for toast!! I had the avocado toast: on small slice of their very thinly sliced \"country bread\"..,sliced avocado one egg, cilantro and seasonings... tasty but again just enough to barely hold you over until lunch! They have cleverly worded the descriptions of their menu items to list every single ingredient maybe to answer inquiries as to how it's prepared but most likely to give the impression of larger portions. I mean on the French Toast they list cinnamon, powdered sugar, syrup...Like I said: style over substance. I truly want locally owned restaurants to flourish and succeed...good luck. (Psst: try U. S. Egg!)",

I went with the Farmer salad and my husband chose the french toast along with some Arnold Palmers. The salad was awesome, it had a generous amount of shaved vegetables, creamy feta and a flavorful vinaigrette. I opted for tuna for some extra protein and avocado which were both nice additions. My husband's french toast was a huge portion of thick Noble bread. It was perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. In addition they had real maple syrup to go with it, and some fresh fruit & bacon. The french toast was so delicious, my husband devoured the whole thing, I thoroughly enjoyed the few bites I was able to steal though. The owner came to make sure that we were enjoying our meals, which I thought was a nice touch. My only complaint was that the lemonade in our Arnold Palmers was extremely tart (as in they may have forgot to add the sweetener?) nothing a few packets of sugar couldn't remedy though. I will be adding this one to our brunch/lunch rotation.",

Okay, $7 for a bowl of steel cut oats with fruit seems ok, until you see the type if random fruit put on top---mine had watermelon and grapes, REALLY?! I mean I know those are cheap but c'mon...I've had my share of oats from many places. So odd considering blackberries and blueberries are in season, tasty & so inexpensive right now. Could also use a few nuts (such as carmelized pecans or others) to add to it. I know the use local produce but there's such a good variety at any local farmers market which go much better with oats.

We ordered the chorizo burrito which was a little spicy but good. We also had the chef special which was the braised pork belly burrito. It tasted mostly like bland potatos but had plenty of pork belly. The burritos were a good size. We also ordered coffee which came in cute mason jars. I enjoyed my coffee. I gave it 4/5 mostly because of the pricing. I felt the coffee was a little on the pricier side. The burritos didn't really stand out for their price. I would definitely try this place again in hopes of getting something better. You order at the counter and they bring you your food, so you choose your seating. I thought everyone was polite. So I had a pleasant experience, I just didn't find the food we ordered as something I would order again.",

That means you wait a ridiculous amount of time in line. - interesting restaurant concept but quality and creativity of food NOT on par with Matt's Big Breakfast or Snooze.",

She thought her muffin and potatoes were really good and her omelet was not amazing but good. I ordered one pancake, an egg and fried cauliflower. Oh Yea and a latte. Latte was great, cauliflower was good it was different than when I ordered it before. I think it was deep fried before and this was a bit different but good. My pancake was not cooked all the way through so I had to send it back...probably didn't need it. What was AMAZING was how much effort the owner gave to me for my pancake being wrong. She was so nice and so concerned and tried over the top to make our experience great which honestly is more important than the food. She even refunded my money you can just tell that she cared so much about your experience and this was awesome and will be what would bring me back again and again.",

My wife and I just had the \"Fame burger\" with waters (on the house) the total was just over $26. That's a burger with no side. When I paid I turned to my wife and said this better be the best burger we've ever eaten. Well, I hate to report it was NOT. The only condiment was catsup, there was one tiny piece of romaine lettuce, a tomato with the hard green center still in tact with a thick slice of onion. On the side there was a very wilted pickle spear that looked like it had been left out to dry. The bun was so dry it literally crumbled in my hands as I tried to eat it (see picture). I love to support local small businesses and am not a negative reviewer at all. I am always quick to leave a great review when I have a good dining experience. This wasn't the case here so I'm just calling it exactly how it was. If you want to trust the 4.5 stars go right ahead I did.",

The parfait was just what I wanted - natural, unsweetened yogurt with local fruit that could not have tasted fresher.  The homemade granola was nice and crispy, not chewy and stale-textured, and had lots of sweetened almond slivers (yum!). I got the large size ($9), and was stuffed.  The mushrooms in the omelette were firm and plump; it was a nicely balanced piece.  The pancakes were also tasty. The coffee was ok. The ambiance is stylish, warm and welcoming.  Prices seemed a little on the high side, but this seems to be the norm as the quality and attractiveness of great little restaurants keeps improving around here.

Today, I had the breakfast sandwich with bacon, which was quite delicious, but nearly $9!  I thought that was excessive for a regular old breakfast sandwich (eggs, cheese & bacon) that came with a small side of fruit.  Their chocolate chip scones are delicious (though a little small), but they're $3, which is a lot for the size.  I've gone back on more than one occasion, though, for scones in particular because their so good.  Not sure if that will continue for the price, though, once my pregnancy cravings subside.  Overall, Fa-me has some high and low points, but ultimately, the reason for my lower review is the price--I'm just not sure the food is worth the expense.",

The French toast is crispy on the outside and silky on the inside. I think they sprinkle it with cinnamon sugar. They do add berries but it's usually 2-3 strawberries which never seems enough considering the portion size- so I recommend ordering extra berries.   The wrap is basically a chorizo breakfast burrito with a side of fresh salsa. SO yum. There is quite a bit of chorizo in it, so unless you love chorizo like me, you may not care for it. The salsa is also a must have, they combine perfectly!   I recommend if you're thirsty to try the limeades! The regular is verrrrry tangy and sour, which I love. But if you're not in the mood for sour, the hibiscus limeade is super refreshing and delicious as well!   And now for the coffee: PERFECTION. Get one. Any one. And drink it up!",

I was expecting a flavorful side potato, but they were deep fried cubes with an after thought of rosemary which could not really be tasted. They were overdone, so...I dipped in ketchup. I am a freak for fresh bread and butter and I really was looking forward to theirs. I asked for extra butter on side to make sure craving was satisfied. Toast was...ok...but the butter I expected was margerine. Is it really that much more expense to provide real butter? Probably won't return.",

The lady at the register was kind and quick, trying to get the line to move fast. We ordered the croque madame, the eggs Benedict, ice caramel latte & the horchata latte. Oh dear lord, the hollandaise sauce (which was really a bechamel sauce with parmesan cheese) yes that's why it looks white instead of yellowish. That hollandaise sauce was the most delicious sauce ever. It was thick & rich and it didn't have a single clump, it was made to perfection. The croque madame was incredibly delicious but for a mind blowing experience I would order it with the hollandaise sauce on top making it a croque monsieur with a sunny side egg on top. And I can't forget to mention the aurugula that they put in the side, it's not just a plate filler, they tossed it in some sort of delicious vinaigrette that just paired up amazing with both our plates. The iced coffee was just perfect. The caramel latte was mellow and with just enough sweetener to still be able to call it a coffee. The horchata was very sweet and although I would call it perfect, this coffee would only make you happy if you like your coffee on the sweeter side; it was a perfect balance of coffee flavor and horchata flavor. Small details, they use paper straws!!! Which is awesome! Save the turtles and sea creatures. The service was awesome as well. I asked for some extra hollandaise sauce and they brought me a great portion, enough to finish my croque madame. Ps. My husband said that was hands down the best coffee he's ever had and he has dinned at some very high end places. This is a place you must visit if you are in the area.",

    "text": "Great food!! Me and my girlfriend came for our anniversary breakfast. We had breakfast wraps & shared Frenchie Toast, both were great! The wrap was a large portion, very well seasoned; the potatoes were just perfect, the Spanish chorizo takes it home. The wrap is a bit spicy. The Frenchie Toast was great as well, to slices of perfectly cooked French toast with strawberries and a light drizzle of confectioners sugar; REAL Maple syrup is the real treat. The interior was really nice, kinda rustic but a modern.  All the staff was very cheery and friendly. Steph helped us and she was very nice, great attitude and amazingly friendly, she recommended the breakfast wrap.",

We waited roughly 30 minutes to order our food but were able to find a seat despite how busy they were. Both of our orders came out super greasy due to having so much cheese. The monte cristo can be expected to be on the greasy side due to it being a French toast sandwich, but there was so much cheese that was melted off of the sandwich that it felt like I dipped my hand in a deep fryer. Our bodies were hardly able to digest them. I'm giving 2 stars because the decor is really nice and the self serve coffee allows you to avoid waiting for someone to come around and fill your cup.",

Now for the good stuff...the food was not only beautiful but tastey!!! My boyfriend had the monte Cristo and the jam that came with it was the perfect balance. I originally did not like my 1st item, but they corrected the issue and got me the parfait and the French toast and wow was it SOOO good.   Can't say enough about the service here.

    "text": "My friend and I stumbled upon Fame Caffe while driving down Central and decided to stop in for breakfast.   I loved the look and decor of the restaurant. The outside seating area where we sat is lined with herb planters which separate you from the parking lot. It is counter service so I'm glad it wasn't extremely busy when we were there.   Everything on the menu sounded pretty great and I finally decided on the Parisian omelette which came with a side of fruit (served in a mini mason jar!) and bread. I noticed the pomegranate sangria and it looked amazing but I opted for a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice, also served in a mason jar! The OJ was fresh and delicious! The omelette was good but a little dry. The portion I thought was a great size, not small but also not over the top big.   Overall I probably wouldn't go back for the omelette but perhaps if I'm in the area I'll stop in and try the sangria.",

    "text": "Delicious! Delicioso! Delicieux!  Chalk this one down as a first for me.  A neighborhood cafe serving a mixture of American, Mexican, and French (!!!) breakfast and lunch items.  All the while sourcing everything organically and almost entirely locally.  Yup, i was an intrigued as you are.  So I ventured here on Saturday morning near their 8am opening to see for myself.  Fame occupies what used to be just your average neighborhood coffee house (Java Cafe).  Ivan and Maria O'Farrill have since turned this prime spot on Central & Highland into an indoor/outdoor restaurant and cafe with beautiful wooden accents throughout the entire space.  There's plenty of seating (probably enough for about 100) but the space is still intimate and cozy enough without being too crowded.  Order at the front counter here whether dining in or taking out.  Be warned as the display case with fresh baked pastries will tempt you greatly while you wait in line to give your order.  As this is the first breakfast spot in Central Phoenix where I've found french breakfast items, I went with the Croque Madame this go around.  I also got a small cup of their house made berry parfait.  Total cost including water and tax came to about $17.  I grabbed a seat at one of the stools at the indoor/outdoor bar table that faces north along Central Avenue since the morning weather was ideal.  Food came out in about 5 minutes.  So here's the lowdown on the Croque Madame.  Two slices of toasted multigrain bread (sourced from Noble Bread, a local Phoenix bakery), with ham in the middle (and lots of it), gruyere cheese on top (again, lots of it), a sunny side up egg and a side of fresh greens.  But the secret sauce here (literally) is the the bechamel sauce that drenches this dish.  Basically its a white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk that is used on a variety of french dishes.  Oh my heavens was this awesome.  It almost eats like a ham & cheese sandwich, but much richer.  Almost as if you were dipping cured ham in a cheese fondue.  Its that gooey and rich (and delicious).  For the berry parfait, it was served in what almost looks like a candle jar and included a berry mixture, greek yogurt, honey, granola, and nuts.  Much bigger portion than I would've expected for the \"small\" size.  Made for a nice light and fruity contrast with the richness of the Madame.  Fantastic breakfast and one that shall be repeated again in the not to distant future.  They also have a decent looking lunch menu with a nice array of beer and wine options to boot.  On weekends they have some special brunch items including a short rib enchilada dish that caught my attention.  And the pastry case will likely be impossible for me to say no to going forward.  So yes, Fame is legit and full of promise.  The ambiance and the food are full proof.  Even, apparently, if you're a French expat.",

There are lots of plants, herbs and spices. Some of the decor was very cleaver, like the egg crates arranged on the ceiling like art.   I hesitated on whether to give this place a 3 or 4... I'd say a 4 on ambiance and location a 3 on service and food. At this price point, you'd expect something other than counter service. Breakfast with coffee is about $15 per person give or take. The food was just ok. I had the Parisian and it was $11 (coffee another 4-5). It's an egg white omelette with gruyere, mushrooms, caramelized onion and spinach. It's obvious they use butter, which is great, however my omelette was VERY greasy, not what you expect with egg whites ( luckily I LOVE butter or I would have sent this back). The onions were also not caramelized, they could have been cooked longer. The bread served with breakfast was the great! Crusty and fresh, I kind of wanted to buy a loaf. My daughter ate the fruit and she have them two baby thumbs up! My hubs had the bfast sandwich and was not impressed. NOT that it was bad, just nothing special, nothing stood out. The coffee is self serve and was ok. I've had better coffee at Merci and other bfast locations with similar set-ups.   I think this place may be worth it if I'm in the area, but if we are planning ahead, we would likely pick somewhere else.",

Slimy texture, just nasty. Can't believe the best thing I can say about this place is that the water is cold. I wouldn't recommend this establishment to my worst enemy... The huge windows in front are right on Central Avenue, which gives you a lovely view of the Cathedral across the street and the experience of actually feeling like you are sitting on the road in traffic eating. My Bentley was the only other thing of interest at this place unless you like barn decor. It was warm outside so they didn't have the transom windows open so the flies could come inside. No worry- even they wouldn't land on this food. My advise would be to pass this place up for some of the really good places in this area and there are many with staff that actually care about their customers and what they serve them.",

They serve many breakfast items many of which are vegetarian but only a few vegan choices unless you have them modify.  I at first was interested in their lunch special but you can't order that until 11 am so since I was there at 9 am decided to go for the avocado toast and a side salad. The service here is very friendly, they are helpful to let you know what the dishes have in them and will modify any dish to your desires. The place is situated with a very large kind of farm style table with a bunch of smaller tables surrounding the place.  Orders come out quickly.  The avo toast was excellent and filling.  They put a spice on top of the avocado which is tasty.  The salad was fresh and good but it was lacking dressing so I asked for more.  It actually worked well to order both dishes because you could take some avocado from the toast and put it on top of the salad.  Both dishes were filling enough but I had a juice before so I was not super hungry.  Overall I would like to come back here again and try lunch but in general it's a great option if you are looking for something healthy and reasonably priced.",

Luckily I've been there around 8:30 and 10 am and there wasn't a line but then literally right after the line was up to the door.",

I love the whole laid-back casualness of the place. How the whole side of the restaurant opens up (probably best in the winter, spring and fall time frame.) And don't stress. You'll score a table, seat or chair. Service seems to be completely staffed by teenagers. And they don't miss a beat. Knowledgeable, efficient and super friendly.

So basically eggs and cheese and if you want additional ingredients it's $1.00 extra and then hopefully they remember to include them. Oh and if you want it to go please plan to wait at least 20 minutes for your food.",

    "text": "Stopped by on my way out of town before a long trip and was BEYOND pleased.  First of all, the interior and ambiance was amazing! The dining area was also super clean, tidy and welcoming; major bonus!  Right when I walked in I was greeted by the young girl at the register. She had a lot of knowledge on the menu items and the restaurants farm to table concept. She talked me through some of her favorites as well as the restaurants most popular items. Despite my thousands of questions and indecisiveness, she happily helped me land on the Frenchie Toast with a side of bacon, a latte and some fresh squeezed orange juice! Let me tell you, I was NOT disappointed! The french toast was just as described; crunchy crust, chewy center, but LOADED with yummy flavors. The bacon is to die for. Seriously. Do not leave Fame without getting a piece (or 10) of that stuff. The barista, William, did an amazing job on the latte... best one I've had in Phoenix! Don't let the price of the fresh-squeezed juices put you off. After one sip, all of my doubts on the price and quality of the ingredients went away.   Throughout my meal I was checked on multiple times, which was nice for a counter service restaurant.  Overall, Fame should definitely be a Phoenix favorite! Between the service, quality food and happy environment, there's no better place to be!",

The food was excellent but I decided to give them a few months before coming back in order to allow them to adapt.   I returned this weekend (July 19, 2015) and cannot be happier for the owners. Our dishes came out quickly and the preparation and plating was excellent. Their croque madame had just the right portions of ham and Gruyere. Their cold soup (potato and leek) was refreshing and well balanced. I'm glad I came back and foresee many trips in the future.",

    "text": "Quaint place. Very busy. I had the FaMe omelet and my daughter had the Greek yogurt with fruit and honey. The omelet was surprisingly small given the price. The scallions listed on the menu board were really just a shaving on top. The outside of the omelet had a great texture and was velvety. No idea how that's done, very impressed. Inside the omelet was kind of a mess. Lots of water meaning the tomatoes were not cooked/cooked enough and thus the heat caused them to \"water out\" the entire inside of the omelet. Bummer. The ham was perfectly cubed which leads me to believe it's just restaurant style cubed ham and not something local. $9.95 for an omelet, especially at this size could still be successful when *excellent ingredients* are used and prepared correctly. It didn't really explode with taste. Not a terrible omelet but a real let down. The bacon included was medium grade supermarket bacon that was almost too moist, meaning it's pre cooked and kept in a steamer. The Fry's Black Label I buy tastes much better to me. Why not just cook it to order?  The $9 jar of Greek yogurt, honey and berries was nice. The berries were fresh BUT no one bothered to de-stem/core the strawberries. My culinary training consists of 4 years of Jack in the Box and even I Know that strawberries, like apples, pears, etc NEED TO BE CORED. Outside of this it was quite nice. Refreshing.  The staff was super nice. Kudos for that. A bad/lackluster meal can be upped a star for good service and smiling, knowledgable staff. Hence the 3rd star.  In all, I'd be willing to come back. I personally think my omelets are every bit as good, if not better (though the outer texture of the FaMe omelet was sublime), and for the price, disappointing in execution and portion size. The ownership might want to have breakfast at Luci's and take some notes.   Hopefully next time things will be better. I really want to like this place.",

This is one of those restaurants where you order at the counter and they bring your food to you if you're eating there. They didn't seem to have paper menus that you can look at if you're new to the place, so my husband and I stood in line looking at the back board menu and had to choose quickly, which was fine.   He ordered a breakfast burrito which had chorizo, eggs and potatoes in it and I ordered what was called 'dos',--two eggs served with potatoes. I added chorizo to my eggs. We were both impressed by how good the chorizo was and added their house made sauce to our meals. Their house made sauce tasted like a smoky, spicier Cholula (which we liked!). Coffee is self serving, as well as water, at a table located in the corner of the restaurant.",

The coffee was so good (better than Lux) and the size/portion is great. The small is a good size. The overeasy plate (bacon, eggs and potatoes) was delightful especially the potatoes and bacon. They were crunchy and just melt in your mouth good! The pancakes were one of the best pancakes I've tried! The service was great too - they offered a bowl of water for my dog, which was sweet.  The tab ended up to be close to $30 - I agree the prices here are a little steep, but it's more like a 5 step hill steep, not a damn mountain. I will take this any day then to wait for an hour somewhere.  This will definitely be my go-to spot for coffee and breakfast from now on. Lots of parking and a mile away from me.",

My go to is the chilaquiles with avocado, but the banana Nutella pancakes are a close second! Their chai is sweet and smooth. Definitely a favorite of mine in central Phoenix! Would highly recommend. I wish they'd bring back their cream cheese berry muffins though. Original pastries from when they first opened were way better!",

I hope the dinner menu evolves a bit by including a side of rice or beans when you get more than one taco. I guess I just expected more since I had one drink and two meatless tacos that came out to about $24.",

It was a Friday morning, but still pretty full! Short line to order, friendly staff, can't complain.  We shared the croque madame and breakfast sandwich. Loved the croque madame! Asked for the egg to be a little more cooked, generous size, full of ham, gruyere and delicious toasted bread. Also came with a side of greens, which was greatly appreciated to cut the richness. The breakfast sandwich was a good price and also pretty yummy, it went really well with the Fame Caffe hot sauce.   Plenty of parking, clean bathrooms, and delicious food.",

We sat and ordered drinks (my friend got a macchiato and I got a bellini). Both were delicious. We took some extra time ordering food as everything looked good. However, we both settled on the veggie scramble.  The food was great, however, the \"scramble\" part felt a little iffy. There was more of a coating of egg on the veggies versus the veggies being integrated within the eggs. Also, there was a rosemary stem (see picture) in both my scramble and my potatoes that was completely unappetizing.   Overall, I would return because the menu looked so amazing and I hope that my problems were due to the everything being so busy.",

    "text": "Fame Caffe is a breakfast/brunch joint that offers chic decor, fair prices, and food that is sometimes (but not always) decent.  During my first visit here a couple of years ago, I was very impressed by their croque madame, considering it to be one of the better variations I've tried due to its flavor and quality of ingredients used. Upon a recent visit, however, the smoked ham was so cold that it completely ruined the entire thing. The mixed greens that comes with the croque is just lightly dressed lettuce, which is kind of dull overall. I've always plugged their croque pretty intensely in the past, but have since taken a couple of steps back based on my recent experience.  I can't say much about the rest of their brunch menu, aside from their pancakes (with Nutella added). I found these to be good enough by the standards of pancakes.  Around this time last year (2017 Fall-ish), Fame was experimenting with a dinner menu that my girlfriend and I had the opportunity to try. Despite being completely dead on the Saturday night we visited, the food we did try, which included chicken flautas and some great quality tacos was something I wish they would have continued on with. Unfortunately, dinner hours have since been abandoned - which is a damn shame.  Anyway, when I browse through a lot of reviews, it sounds like I'm not the only one that has had some problems with food consistency. Nevertheless, on a good day, I feel that Fame is still a respectable brunch option in Central Phoenix.  But you can't expect me to give them anything beyond three stars when I'm paying for cold croques.",

He got the breakfast wrap with chorizo and added avocado and he loved it so much, we got it again the next day before we left! His Mexican side makes him super picky about his chorizo but LOVED it. For $9, not bad.  The next morning when we are in, I ordered the eggs benny and it was good but the sauce was too much and too cheesy. The toasted bread crust was pretty hard to cut too but the potato's were good. It was also $14 which is expensive even by LA standards and I couldn't even finish half of it bc it was too salty (cheesy sauce & salty ham).   Topped off our breakfast with fresh squeezed orange juice that was pre-squeezed into mason jars but man oh man it was delicious! Love me some fresh OJ. Well worth the $2!  The line was pretty long both days but day 1 we called ahead of time and just waited in line to pay. Day 2 we ordered at the register, were give a number and the food was brought out to us. The server was HUSTLIN. She was non-stop back and forth and so nice. Place is also super cute and photo-op worthy with a good amount of seating and parking.",

(side note, the pickles are gross.  but thats just my opinion)",

We didn't know what to expect because we only had about 5 minutes to look at the Yelp reviews in between restaurants. Boy were we fortunate that the other restaurant was closed! The food and the service at Fame was exceptional! The atmosphere was trendy and pleasant and the location was convenient. My friend ordered the breakfast wrap, I ordered the Croque Monsieur with a side of potatoes and we split an order of pancakes that came with a side of fresh fruit. Each dish was delicious and it's obvious that they use the freshest ingredients available. The pancakes were light and flavorful and I swear they have someone in the back churning butter! It was that good!!! The owner stopped by our table to check on us. She has to be the sweetest lady alive! She was genuinely concerned about our happiness & confirmed their use of fresh and organic local products. Fame is a new favorite of mine. I can't wait to go back and try something new!!! Oh yeah...the cappuccino I had was delicious too!!!",

It is seat yourself so it is hit or miss if two tables are available together.  They have a full cafe so you can enjoy espresso, mocha or latte with your breakfast.    Highly recommend.",

The prices were a little high for breakfast but not so much so that we would be deterred from returning.",

    "text": "Wow.  I can't believe I've never written a review for this place.  Maybe because it's in my 'hood and because I go so often now that it almost seems unfair.  Funny thing is... I drove past this restaurant for years thinking Fame was a lamp shop.  I didn't realize it was a restaurant until I went to my other favorite luxious coffee shop down the street and found a line out the door.  So, I turned to Yelp to find an alternative breakfast spot and \"boom\" -- a relationship was born.    I have given this restaurant, coffee shop and hang-out spot a 5-star review because it has an amazingly delicious menu, wonderful environment and friendly, accommodating and helpful staff.  I have tried a few things on their menu, but have settled on the Fame omelette with greens as my favorite meal.  The omelette is the perfect balance of fluff and cheese.  I enjoy substituting the potatoes and bread for salad greens with a lite slick of their house dressing.  The fresh brewed coffee is delectable.    The restaurant is located on the west side of Central Ave just south of Camelback.... A very popular area of Phoenix chock full of loacl places to eat.  I love this restaurant because it has a cottage feel to it... Open and exposed brick walls, huge windows allowing the flow of Eastern sunlight.  A huge community table is positioned as the center piece of the dining room.  That table always has folks sitting together and chatting it up.    Lastly, the staff is amazing.   They are Always friendly, always kind and helpful when ordering.  The food always comes quickly and is hot and delicious.  Return Factor: 100%",

I come here to work and the wi-if is pretty bad to be honest. I would come more if it had faster WiFi but the WiFi In 2019 is simply unacceptable.  If you come here for only food then it's a five star review. If you come to work, just be warned, the WiFi isn't great and the available outlet situation is VERY SLIM!!!

We all tried something different and our choices directly represented our personalities.   I have the tofu and turmeric tacos. Wow, it was delicious and seemed very much like scrambled eggs. The corn tortilla was standard but the veggies and black beans were fresh and popped with flavor. I love breakfasts tacos. These joined my list of delicious tacos.

From the outside looking in, it seemed like there would be a server(s) who'd take your order for you but it's a walk up counter to order and they give you a number & bring food to you when it's ready.   We believe it would have been a better experience if it had servers because everyone was walking around and it got really crowded with the lines, which made it difficult to feel relaxed for a good brunch atmosphere.   The food itself is exceptional! I had their Benny and the hollandaise that came on it was the best I've ever had. I think we may return but only if we get food to-go.  TLDR; not a relaxing or comfortable atmosphere, but food is very good!",

All the different customers we sat with during our stay realized as soon as they'd done it, because it made such a god-awful noise. Other than that we liked it.",

    "text": "Came on a Saturday for brunch and I was excited to try out their food because of the great reviews and crowded place. Their set up is a bit weird, you go in line to order your food and they find you a table. Once you order and there's no table available, they hold your order until there's an a available spot for your party.   We asked for a table of 6, but was given a table for four, so our party got seated separately once I informed them of the mistake. I understand the situation since there were a lot of people and it was crowded. I felt like they should have a better system and just make it a regular sit-down restaurant.  As for the food, we ordered a breakfast wrap, huevos rancheros, and french toast. I was excited for the breakfast wrap because I love chorizos, but was a bit disappointed because it was pretty bland that I added some salt to it. As for the huevos rancheros.. it just didn't sit well with me.. My boyfriend and I only ate the eggs and sausages included with the meal. As for the french toast, it was still soggy when it got to our table. The food came out really quick maybe I think the quality got compromised with the toast.  Overall experience was meh, not sure I'll be coming back though.",

My boyfriend ordered an iced horchata latte... delicious! A bit sweet but tasty!   We also ordered the vegan breakfast tacos and they were amazing! There are three breakfast tacos on corn tortillas made with avocado cream, black beans, tofu scramble, shredded cabbage and cilantro sprouts served with a side of salsa. Okay, it sounds simple but thats the exact reason they were so good! The salsa tasted homemade, roasted and fresh. I believe for the drink and tacos it was $16.   The cashier was friendly and quick to take my order and all the staff was very helpful. The interior is airy and wood themed. They also use paper straws which was nice to see. I'm not really someone who would go out of my way to come to a spot that only had one vegan option but I'd come back here!",

    "text": "After countless times up & down Central Ave. passing fa-me Caffe on the way to somewhere else, always saying \"I (or we) need to try that place one of these days\", it finally happened that on Memorial Day my friends and I decided to make a visit. We arrived some time around mid-morning to an already hopping crowd. The line to the ordering counter was at the door but actually moved relatively quickly. Unbeknownst to us, this is the process: you place your order upon reaching the counter from the very extensive menu board, pay for your meal and it will be delivered to your table in a pretty timely manner. While waiting one of the staff will inquire as to how many in your party and will suggest a place to sit, putting a numbered marker at your table, reserving it. A little different, but it all works pretty seamlessly and everyone in line, most having been there before, were in good spirits.   The menu, as I mentioned, is pretty extensive and I'd be hard-pressed to list all that's available. For myself I chose the chicken pesto sandwich with chips and a nice-sized pickle. This was not some frozen chicken patty, but fresh-sliced roasted chicken with mixed greens, tomato, red onions and gruyere served on ciabatta. I found it to be really rather tasty and not too unwieldy. Just enough. I accompanied that with a pretty decent Bloody Mary, available in either mild (my choice) or spicy consisting of Ohso vodka, tomato &  Worcestershire sauce,  fresh squeezed lime juice, olives and a pickle all nicely presented in a mason jar. I'm a fan. I will have to sample the spicy version on my next visits. The mimosas chosen by my two friends looked good as well, though they did state they weren't quite the best they'd ever had.   The space is a bit smaller than I'd imagined but really there seemed to be no lack of seating, with tables ringing the perimeter and larger hightop tables in the center. There is also a pretty nice patio area along the side of the cafe that looked to be pretty popular.   The staff was very friendly and attentive, and looked like they knew how to handle the busy crowds that I'm sure is typical on the weekends and on this holiday. It's a relaxed yet vibrant place that I think adds a lot to the character of Phoenix' food landscape. Very recommended.",

This place gets packed and the menu on the blackboard can be hard to read, but don't let this get you down. The line moves quickly, especially if you grab a menu from the lower left of the cashier's counter to read while you wait. The croque madame and chilaquiles are sublime and they have phenomenal coffee and teas. Definitely ask to have your coffee topped with their fresh whipped cream which at times can come in different flavors!",

I arrived early waiting for a friend with the intention of enjoying a cup of coffee before I got there. So I had to wait in line 15 minutes for my cup of coffee and a table. Fifteen minutes later, my friend and I had to stand in line again to order. Taking all orders at the front did cut down on the waiter traffic throughout the floor which is good because its a bit crowded already.   The menu was amazing; lots of variety with fresh ingredients (me like). I had avocado toast and my friend had the vege scramble. Both were amazing. The coffee was very good (pricey) - one of the best cups I've had in a long time.   Not sure if I would go back - maybe on a weekday when not as busy. For some reason, the standing in line annoyed me - I must be getting old.",

Interior of the place is beautiful and the menu was very interesting and had me debating what to get.. I got the chicken pesto sandwich and the pesto; overall it was a bit blah, mainly because the chosen bread was not to my taste. A bread thinner and less drying would go a long way as well as a mayo to add more Sauce. 4 stars because our large group received great service and decent food all around.",

    "text": "Fame Caffe was just okay. The cafe is fast casual style, where you order at a counter and they bring out your food to the table. I was very excited when I looked at the menu because they serve both breakfast and lunch all day and have a ton of vegetarian dishes, which you can always add meat to. I ordered the avocado toast and a chai tea latte.  We received our table number and picked out a spot in the restaurant.   They brought out our food fairly quickly and our server asked if they could grab us anything else...yes, our lattes. Later, I asked again for our lattes. Then after I finished my meal, I returned to the counter and asked for our lattes, now in a to-go cup. They finally brought them to us. I noticed the table next to us also received their drinks after their food and they had ordered green teas...so a tea bag in hot water. Fame need to figure out what is going on at the beverage making station.   As for the food itself, it was okay. The avocado toast is pretty small. The avocado was sliced vs. mashing them and it was not quite ripe enough . I liked that they added cilantro and lemons to the toast though; that made it flavorful and the bread itself was high quality.  I wouldn't order the chai latte again. It was bland, it really lacked that spicy chai flavor. It seemed like it wasn't properly mixed because when I finished my latte, there was clumps at the bottom.",

They even have oat milk which is what I used for my Carmel latte. I will be back and I recommend checking out this spot!",

Had fresh juices, the counter server offered her favorite and it had very nice balance to it. Ordered the spinach and mushroom omelette and it was perfectly cooked. The cheese and mixins were abundant and the fruit bowl was substantial.  I like the toast they use, lots of grains and flavor. I was playing with the baby and letting him eat some fruit and they brought us over a brownie. Nice people, maybe Spanish decent. Just a True love for hospitality and care for the guests in the building. Great job!",

The bread was so cheesy and delicious, but not so toasty that it cuts your mouth like a lot of Croques I've had.  The egg was cooked perfectly, the ham was delicious and not too salty, and they didn't add anything ridiculous like mustard, as I've run into other places.  My friend had the steak sandwich, and it was great too.  The steak was cooked perfectly and not at all tough.  I also ordered a side of potatoes, which weren't anything to write home about, but my Croque more than made up for that!  I will be back!",

I ordered an iced coconut mocha and the breakfast sandwich when I ordered the woman taking my order asked me if I was ok with bacon I told her yes she took my moms order which was a parfait and a honey latte my mom asked if she could have it in a medium cup the woman told us they have only two sizes of coffee cups both glass mugs and if she wanted a medium cup it would be in a medium Togo coffee cup not in a class cup and then asked if we wanted her parfait Togo as well. We told her no . We sat down a red headed waitress came and brought my moms parfait and my coffee I tried my coffee and it didn't have any coconut flavoring I went to the register and asked what was In the coffee she told me chocolate and coconut milk I asked to make it sweeter the woman recommended vanilla flavoring I tried it it still wasn't sweet enough so I asked for more sweetener i took it back to my seat waited another 10 minutes and I noticed that a group of people who came in after us already had their food I stopped the red headed waitress and asked about my breakfast sandwich she said she'd check. A guy waiter came up to us to take our table number away we explained I was waiting on a breakfast sandwich. The red headed waitress came back and explained to us that the woman who took our order said we never ordered a sandwich. I told them to cancel it at this point I was frustrated and since my drink still wasn't right I asked for a refund. The red headed waitress was super rude and wanted an explanation as to why. I told her and gave her my card she walked away and then came back explaining that she didn't need my card to do a refund. The manager brought back my receipt with the refund. We left. rather then being heard or accommodated they were rude and because of that I'll never go back. I work in customer service for a large corporation and this is a prime example of how NOT to handle an employee mistake. I get it shit happens but if the employees wanted to make it right they could've rather then blaming me and telling me I didn't order something. Bye Felicia!",

The things I heard such good things about. Why don't we order enough product to cover the demand, especially if it's a popular item. I found it to be very overpriced for what you get. I ordered a BLT and a iced coffee, $14!!. My friend I was with ordered the breakfast sandwich. The way they were prepared made it almost impossible to eat. The breakfast sandwich falls apart in the first bite with how they layered the items and the bread used for the BLT is so hard and the bacon not evenly placed it punctures the bread and mayo goes everywhere. Not happy at all. Would try it again but hope for a better experience.",

The house potatoes and bacon were also soooo delicious and the butter pancakes were by far some of the best I've ever had. Coffee is amazing, the \"easy going\" pressed juice was delicious.

My friend got the buffalo chicken sandwich and House-made chips (I stole handfuls of the chips). The spot is super cute. You go up to a counter, order, and pick a spot to sit. So it's super quick and easy. The workers are super sweet and terribly good at their jobs. Don't forget to try their house hot sauce!",

First time was just a for a quick coffee on their very cute open patio/bar area (which is dog friendly, they even have water bowls out for them). The restaurant has a cute farm to table ambiance. The egg cartons on the ceiling are a great conversation starter!  Second time was for brunch on a Sunday. The parking lot was a little full, luckily the restaurant was busy but not too busy. We had to wait in line to order but we found a table without any issues. Service is fantastic and prompt. And food is delicious! This visit I had the huevos rancheros (which I have never had before), they were very good but I didn't have anything to compare them to. We ordered Flat Whites to drink (which weren't on their menu) and they completely accommodated us.   I can't wait to come back to try some of the other items on the menu (looking at you parisian omelette) and bring my dog.",

We ordered the Veggie Scrambler and the Breakfast wrap (see pictures), which were both very good. The Veggie scrambler also came with red roasted potatoes which were sprinkled with a hit of rosemary. Nice touch! We ordered jam for the bread, which was strawberry. Not sure if it was homemade or not, but that was also good. A vanilla latte to drink was added to our order, which totaled a very reasonable $23. All and all, this place is a solid recommendation.

I honestly could have made a burrito better at home. The tortilla was hard and it was a bit dry on the inside. Loved the orange juice and my daughter enjoyed the apple juice. I would probably wait for more time to pass to give it another try",

    "text": "Why would I like Fa-me Caffe? I can't even pronounce it or spell it. Is it Fa'me with the French thing above the a? Or Fa-me with a hyphen? And don't get me started on the two Fs in Caffe. Ha ha. Who cares, cause the food is tres bon! Oh my god we loved it! We drive by all the time and just today went for the first time. I never order omelettes because I prefer eggs over easy or eggs Benedict. And if I do order an omelette I have to put ketchup on it. But Fa-me doesn't have eggs Benedict so now I am just pointing at things written on their menu board. My wife ordered the breakfast wrap and iced mocha. Well...now the fun begins. The mochas are fantastic. And we ran into a person my wife knows from high school. They raved about the oatmeal and said that is what they always order. Now I am wishing I had ordered oatmeal. Now for my food review. The food arrived and looked good. But tasted even better! My omelette with mushrooms and caramelized onions was so so good! I felt like I was in Paris sharing an incredible meal with my gorgeous wife at a cozy little French bistro. Of course I knew I was in America just by looking up at the egg cartons glued to the ceiling, and the 105 degrees outside - but still...such a great tasting, well thought out breakfast with crispy bacon just the way we like it - and the cheese in my light and fluffy omelette so perfect with the onions. I think you just converted me into an omelette lover. So perfect that if I were the chef and I saw a customer putting ketchup on it I'd throw them out of the restaurant immediately, lol. As for Rebecca's wrap full of potatoes, 5 stars from her as well! The green salsa is the best! And my wife is very picky about salsa. She is an Arizona native and knows her salsas. She said it was so fantastic she could drink it. Seriously. We bought more of it to take home. We don't have tortilla chips so we just may be drinking salsa tonight while reflecting on or wonderful 5 star experience at Fa-me Caffe with two Fs. We'll be back for sure. I'll be trying the oatmeal or possibly doing the omelette again with salsa on it this time!",

I would like to give the restaurant four stars, but I will leave the review at only 3 because two things bother me. 1. It's higher priced, and 2. Short hours  Gratefully, the staff has adapted a good routine for handling the morning crowd. Every time I go, several people are waiting for service. Some customers are couples who go to Fame to sit and enjoy a nice brekkie. I always feel like the only one in a hurry.   The fresh juices are good and the pastries look delicious. I think I tried the banana bread and something lemony. I was happy to find them moist, but not oily.    -------  I'm not considering my second visit to Fame in the review, but I just have to mention it because it's funny.  On a particular morning, I was the first folk there. I ordered and then held out cash to pay, but was told that cash orders couldn't be taken for another half hour or so. OoHHH. Did someone forget to fill the CASH register?  Like I said, I'm always in a hurry, so there was no way I was going to wait around. Leaving  empty handed felt so weird and rejected-like, though. Two hours later, I burst out laughing because I was thinking: my change would have only been $3. Between all of the staff, they couldn't reach in their pockets and make petty cash/change? What a chuckle that was.",

The bread and vanilla citrus custard quality really shine in the French toast.  The croque Madame balanced the tasty flavors of the gruyere cheese, egg and ham.  Yum yum yum!  The service was great too.  This isn't a formal sit down and a server takes your order set up, but believe me they absolutely care that you have a great experience.  The owner came by and gently asked how our food was and what else we might need.  She was truly concerned that we enjoyed our meal and experience.

You can however, 1.) place fruit in a small cup ( preferred method) or 2) have some type of a divider between warm and cold food. I guess for potatoes, since they are usually hot, you can place together with an omelet? Another issue is the amount of ingredients in your omelet. I got the \" Gruyere omelet\" which is suppose to have cheese, onion, spinach, and mushroom( but I said no mushrooms please), and maybe something else? I could not taste anything but eggs. And when I opened up the omelet there were no onions and very little cheese and spinach( like 2-3 leaves). No favor or excitement. Very disappointing.     The salsa taste old. It's not fresh and saucy. Could not help make up for the plain and tasteless Omelet. : (   But it's only been open for 3 weeks so they say. So I will give them the benefit of the doubt... I should have checked my food before I left.  On a positive note, the coffee and the customer service were good. I'm sure this place will be able to work out these errors and become successful.",

Jasmin who helps to seat you was super nice, and the other girl who brought out our food was extra helpful.  It's got a nice vibe and many yummy looking things on the menu.    For our first visit, we ordered the veggie scramble (2 eggs, goat cheese, mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower), which comes with toast and house potatoes for $8.95.  It was good.  The potatoes were too salty for my husband;  I'm a salt addict and thought they were amazing.  The coffee was also good.    We came back two days later and tried the \"Frenchie Toast ('Pain Perdu' style country bread & cinnamon & powdered sugar & berries)\" for $9.50.  I loved it more than my husband, but he's not as much of a French toast person.  I'd give it a 10 out of 10...perfect bread, texture, and flavor.  You get four slices with maybe 12 berries and real maple syrup!  We also ordered the \"avocado toast\" from their lunch menu (\"sea salt & sesame seeds & cilantro & chimayo pepper & lemon vinaigrette\") for $7.  We added a side of seasonal veggies for $4.  Both were fine for what they were.. Really healthy food, though I should've asked for whole wheat toast.  Definitely would return!",

    "text": "As Fa-me was being built, I was curious to know what type of food the neat and inviting looking space would serve. Several months after passing by daily, my boyfriend suggested we try it out. I am so glad we did!   During my first visit, my sweetheart and enjoyed a delicious breakfast and he had cold brew coffee while I had fresh squeezed juice. Knowing the food and drink is locally sourced and prepared fresh daily was icing on the cake and made me yearn to go back and try a different menu item.   On my next visit, my roommate had what she said was the best chorizo, egg and potato wrap. It looked delicious and, while I would have loved to have the same, I don't eat pork. The one and only downfall of this place, that I can see, is the lack of meat offerings. If I remember correctly, the only meat choices are sausage, chorizo or bacon.   One of the most special moments of my most recent visit was the extremely wonderful interaction with the owner Maria. She was an absolute delight and you can tell she truly cares about her business and the patrons. Not to mention, she is a dog lover! Hence the reason dog bowls and biscuits are available for our pup friends, who are welcome to enjoy the open front patio.  This is an incredible place and wonderful opportunity to support an up and coming local business. Definitely check it out!",

Had a lovely brunch that runs until 3 p.m... tested the French toast created from Noble Country bread and the hubster had the oatmeal which could easily have fed an army.  French toast was crunchy in a way that only Noble bread could create with delicious under notes of vanilla.   The hearty oatmeal had to have been cooking on the stove all morning to create such wonderful meaty rolled oats  with carmelized bananas slices throughout.   the Juice Meister was kind enough to create a special Sweet Tooth version of healthy juices just for me. I know I need the vitamins but don't want to know they're there and he achieved that in a wonderful mixture.    Clean, hip vibe and the friendliest service and most competent service I have ever experienced during a soft opening. Next week comes the hard opening and I wish them well... they deserve it",

The food has always been good and the service is polite and consistent. But today... of all days... I ordered the same thing at 2pm and by 5pm I started to suffer what would be the worst case of food poisoning I've ever had in many years, maybe the worst yet. I've been in tears for the past 5 hours in my mom's bathroom in excruciating pain. My mom wants to take me to the urgent care, but I told her I'll be camping out in the bathroom cuz I don't feel safe. I don't know what happened, but something went wrong, maybe the inside of the omelette was undercooked, maybe the milk in the horchata latte went bad... I have no idea and may never know. All I know is I'm suffering from the only food I've had today and it's totally not cool. Now I can't come back because I'm scared I'll have to repeat this misfortune.",

The concept is fast casual and you move through the line pretty quick even on a busy Saturday. The black iced tea was OK. I had the Croque Madame. It looks deceptively small when plated but it was very filling and being made with 9 grain bread it made for a more relaxed eating pace, I loved it. I also got to try the breakfast wrap and it was good too. One of our party got an egg that was still clear and it was immediately cleared and a new plate brought out in short order. The owner/manager? came back twice to make sure their second try was acceptable. The servers were also the bussing staff and whatever else needed attention and it worked smoothly. The patio is dog friendly.",

Now it's $8 just for the pancakes (I always add blueberries so $10) and a side of bacon is $4. Not to mention we got an egg sandwich this weekend and asked for a side of avocado and the girl at the counter said \"It's $3 is that okay?\" $3 for a slice of avocado is ridiculous and not even nicer restaurants charge that much for a sliver. We know prices increase over the years but not sure why the are increasing their prices to a ridiculous amount. Guess we will just drive up the street to lux from now on.",

You have multiple options to choose from and the beverage options are just as great as the food. I chose the Parisian omelette and matcha to drink. You get seated with a number which is how they locate you to deliver your food. My omelette was decadent and flavorful, and my tea was smooth and creamy. Great overall experience, I will definitely return next time I'm In town.",

It was about 90% full but no one lined up to order. We went to the counter to order. I had the croque madame and my friend had the special Monte Cristo. Both were done perfect. The croque madame was very good, the egg done perfectly. For me there was too much ham, that is just me, not a complaint. It made it too rich.  When I go again, I may ask if it can be made with half the amount of ham. My friend loved the Monte Cristo. After we were there about 30 minutes there was a line of about 10 people or more to order and it stayed that way until we left about 11:30. Clearly very popular. I can see why as the food is good.",

They are served with a side of maple syrup and they charge you like a $1 for more syrup, which is pretty annoying.  Especially because you pay at the counter before you get your food, so you have to get a whole separate tab just for some more dang syrup!  I didn't need more syrup for my pancakes, but my friend did.  I got the lemonade (it was actually limeade) and that was good too.  We really liked the decor of this place and on a Sunday morning parking was actually easy to find, though I imagine that lot can sometimes get filled up.",

Came in on a Friday morning for a late brunch with some friends in town. I ordered the breakfast sandwich as did one of my friends. My other friend had the breakfast tacos. The sandwich was delicious, however I'm not pro to cutting an avocado in half and plopping it onto the sandwich. It wasn't hard to slice my avo myself - just was surprised that this was a method people were using in the food business....  I stole a few bites of the breakfast tacos - now that's a damn good taco. The mashed potatoes were an interesting mix up. Would definitely order that next time!  The daily brewed coffee was good and their specialty drinks also look pretty awesome. This place has been on my list for awhile. I'm super glad I finally got to try it. There's tons on the menu I'd be happy to devour! Will be back for sure.",

We didn't have to wait and ordered a variety of salads and sandwiches. I had an avocado grilled cheese. The sandwich was huge portion and the ratio between cheese and avocado was pretty even. The cheese was warm and gooey and the blend of creamy avocado and greens and toasty bread was a nice combination. For the take out, it was an order for about 12 people. The order was to be picked up at 12 noon but it wasn't ready until 12:20. Some of the hot sandwiches were not very hot and one order was missing. It was also on a Saturday around lunch so the parking lot was packed. I had to park behind the building in an alley and walk to the restaurant. It would be awesome if they had one or two to-go spots since the parking is limited. I like their food, the restaurant can get crowded a a little chaotic, but the servings are plenty and fresh and healthy. I'm glad this restaurant is here and local and serving the good people of midtown. With slight improvements, it could be the best in the area!",

I ordered the Croque Madame and the wife got the quiche. We both ordered regular, self serve, black coffee. The mugs were retro styled and really cool, the coffee itself was just ok. I tasted like convenient store stuff. Her spinach quiche was pretty good but the spinach was not mixed in very well, it was in one big lump. My Croque was pretty good but it had almost zero bechamel sauce on top although I could taste just a hint of cheese between the bread. Normally I would give 3-4 stars for the food quality, but watching employees stock the boxes above the cabinets lowered my rating. Two employees used a 4 foot ladder one was standing on the top step, then the other used the ladder standing on the 2nd highest step (both an OSHA no-no).  We were not asked how the food was and several employees just did not seem happy to be there. I doubt waitresses know about ladder safety but the manager/owner better figure it out.",

I LOVED the crispy cheese on the ends of the sandwich, my boyfriend was definitely trying to steal bites of it haha. Side salad was good too! Pickle tasted funky to me, I think because I was expecting dill but instead it was almost sweet-tasting. My boyfriend got the croquet madame which looked like a masterpiece! He said a little bit too much cheese but otherwise really good and filled him up. My sister got fruit and roasted veggies, both delicious. My mom got some kind of turkey sandwich but without bread and they were happy to accommodate, she liked it! My dad got a buffalo chicken sandwich and it was huge, he said he enjoyed his meal too. We also got tea which was tasty. I'd be glad to come back!",

This morning on a whim I entered Fame Caffe for with the intent to grab some breakfast then a cup of coffee to go.  I was immediately attracted to the look and ambiance of Fame - open, bright and friendly.  However I have a strong dislike when restaurants have you order at the counter than bring your food to you.  I prefer the old fashioned wait staff.  In this case, I am glad I stayed instead of looking for a new restaurant.  Food was served fresh, hot and delicious.  My cappuccino did not look like any cappuccino I had been served before but was delightful.  Only when I ordered a coffee to go but asked to have it after I ate (not at the time I had to order and pay) did my customer service dip. The barista tried to have me take my cup then as it was \"easier\".  But my hostess took care of it in a very pleasant and professional manner.  Overall a great stop and would recommend Fame Cafe.",

Not being able to eat wheat there is a limited menu but I settled on the Quiche with fruit and an Americano.  The Americano was decent but not as good as my little espresso maker can make at home which I had one earlier.  The Quiche was also pretty good but I could tell it was not baked that day because it was served ice-box cold!  It looks like, for the most part this place is all about freshness and quality.  They even have organic coffee.  If the quiche had been baked that day I don't think they would have needed to store it in the refrigerator.   It was pretty good cold, I imagine it would be great warm.   The fruit was fresh and I'm glad that was cold!  The rest of the food that went by looked really good.  Too bad I can't eat bread because there were a few things I would try here!  Overall cute place and I would come back here again.  I see they have some draft beers here and grass-fed angus burger.",

The food was pretty good, my wife's huevos rancheros were tasty, the dish I ordered was fair( don't remember how to say it - chitaquita or something) it was eggs over a pile of yellow con tortilla chips , some red onion slices and a white cream fresh/ sour cream . It was lacking serious flavor and was a little pricy to be so bland( my wife recommended it, and said it had blue corn chips and was better last time .The spicy Bloody Mary got them the 4th star otherwise I would have put this as a 3. Look forward to coming back and trying some other menu items, it's just a bummer that my first go, my meal kinda sucked and no there wasn't a call back.

They were crunchy which is not a texture I like to have when eating french toast. A lot of it also had to do with the syrup. It had such an odd taste to it, it was not sweet as you would expect any syrup to taste. Ending off on a good note though, the service was really nice and the atmosphere of the location is awesome.",

It's along Central Ave. near a bunch of other restaurants. I got the Fame Omelette, which I thought was decent, but not great. My friend got the breakfast wrap. For my drink, I got the iced mocha and it was pretty standard.   I liked the vibe here very much! I wasn't impressed with the food the first time around, but I plan to come back and try something else. The atmosphere and service were good enough for me to want to try this place again.",

That doesn't bother me but Christine is always aware of a look that is about to die. It is definitely \"of the time\" but not especially creative.  Service: Wow! really really fast. Water is self serve (I can live with that). The silverware is in an enamel coated coffee cup with enough for a whole days worth of customers. This was fine by me but Christine said \"what if someone coughed on these\".   Food: Adequate. Not \"bad\". Just not anything special. The potatoes were bland. The omelette was uninspired (but an omelette is an omelette). Christine said her special order hot chocolate with a splash of regular (not espresso) was good. High praise from Christine.  Portions: No complaints. Good portion sizes  Price: Not crazy expensive but not cheap.   Other: It looks like this place might convert into a bar of sorts at night. Not sure, but there appears to be a full-ish looking bar behind the counter/bar where people are currently eating breakfast",

I got here around 10:30am the other weekend and while I was fortunate to park right in front of the restaurant, others were not so lucky. So I think I arrived at prime brunching time because the line was literally out the door, yet it moved significantly fast. While I waited I was given a number to remember and a gentlemen asked where I would like to sit, to save me a spot with the numbered placeholder. Great idea. Since I was on my own I was able to snag an outside table, which I 100% recommend if you can while the weather is still fantastic. My grapefruit mimosa was perfect, the horchata latte was such a treat to sip on the drive home, and I really enjoyed the madame croquette and side salad. Next time I would probably ask to go easy on all the ham. The best, and most memorable, moment of me eating there was the actual owner of the restaurant came up and asked about the food. She then cleared my plates and asked about my day and if she could do anything else for me. I cannot remember the last time I'd had such an amazing experience. This place is a booming success and I can't wait to be back with friends. It is worth the drive, the wait, and the price!",

It was full of eggs, potatoes, chorizo, and cheese.  The wrap was delicious and the green salsa it came with complemented it well.  Additionally, because I'm a glutton, I had a scone.  There are a few different flavors to choose from and I went with the Vanilla/Almond/Strawberry.  It was excellent.  The iced coffee too was very good.  If you're into lattes and the like there is a coffee bar to meet your needs.  The decor of the restaurant is great and there is ample seating no matter your group size.  There are about 8 tables outside as well.    The prices are a bit steep.  My breakfast was $16.  I'll be back but due to that reason alone, it won't be as often as I'd like.",

The juice tasted very yummy and it was sweet, the french toast was DELICIOUS. Food comes quick, too.  Cute place.",

I teach, perform, and work across the street at The Torch Theatre and it's awesome to have a place within very close walking distance to grab coffee or a bite.  It's hard to recommend one single item when they do so much, so well. Their breakfast sandwich and their breakfast wrap are both wonderful and hearty. Basically, though, it's just quality ingredients, prepared well, and at a good price. Good times!  Even if you just need coffee and a place for free wifi or to read a newspaper, it's a pretty calm place to hang out.   If you haven't been to Fame Cafe before, you should! If you've already been, I'm sure you'll visit soon.",

The food is delicious- I highly recommend the Croque Madame (with one sunny side up egg on top) or the Croque Monsieur (without egg), it's kind of heavy but incredible good! The line moves quickly there, so your never waiting to long and the ladies who take your order are always pleasant. My one and only crux with this spot is that their coffee is constantly out. They keep it in a self pour container, which for obvious reason, runs out quickly with the volume of people who come through. The fact that they are always  'borderline' out of coffee as a breakfast cafe is just... well, kind of ridiculous. Other then that the food is so good, atmosphere so pleasing and service so pleasant that you can overlook the coffee goofiness. However, all and all, I'm very happy and will continue to visit this place time and time again!!",

They have switch around the physical layout of the place, streamlined their ordering system, and have expanded the menu to incorporate a wider variety of breakfast and lunch options. Most importantly, however, they have kept True to their mission of serving locally sourced, splendidly tasty food! Their breakfast sandwich is sublime (for some reason, their eggs are fluffy, light, and heavenly) and their breakfast wrap (with added avocado) is the perfect way to start the day. Highly recommend getting here before 10am on the weekend though, as it does get very busy!",

The omelette was tasty and a good size. Oh, and the decor was so cute! They have a farmhouse style going on that would make Joanna Gaines proud.

I got the breakfast wrap. It has chorizo, egg, cheese, and potatoes wrapped in a tortilla.  It came cut in half, with the outside tortilla cooked perfectly to a crisp. It has really surprising how one little thing like crisping the outside tortilla can change the dynamic of a simple chorizo burrito. I loved it. My fiancee got some banana pancakes and she feel in love with them. One thing that is hard to find for some reason is pancakes that have bananas cooked into them instead of them stacked on top. The had a pretty big menu for breakfast and lunch. Their coffee was wonderful as well. I loved how relaxed the environment was. This place needs to be more popular. Definitely be going back.",

My boyfriend is obsessed with buffalo chicken sandwiches/wraps/pizzas so of course he ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich here.  I took a bite and have to say, it is the BEST buffalo chicken sandwich I've ever had!!  The difference between the food here and a lot of other places is the quality of ingredients.  The chicken tasted fresh, not drenched in buffalo sauce to hide the day-old taste like other places.  They use Noble Bread, which was delicious and chewy.  The green heirloom tomato gave the sandwich a delightful crunch.    It looks like they try to locally source their ingredients, which is great.  Service is very noncommittal hipster vibe, hence the 4 stars.  All in all, a great place for good food.  Highly recommended if you are in the area!",

I'd much rather relax here for brunch than somewhere with an hour wait and lots of noise and chaos. The breakfast tacos and half iced/half hot Fame mocha are so bomb!",

The food was very well priced and the portions were very large. I ordered the vegan quinoa bowl and it was amazing. I could not believe how well the food was prepared and tasted.   The service is quick and great! Our food was out in about 10 minutes after ordering. After our meal the owner stopped over and asked about our dining experience. She explained the restaurants concept and idea and thanked us for stopping by. As a nice surprise she brought over some banana nut bread to dip in my coffee.   I will be back! What a great little spot.",

    "text": "Best crouqe madame in the city, paired with the absolute best french fries that I've ever discovered. The chef explained the french fry process to me which he articulated has if an artist describing the process of his latest masterpiece. If for no other reason I recommend individuals try this aesthetically well put together breakfast and lunch nook for the fries, crispy exterior with a smooth delicate center. These guys are knocking it out of the park, unfortunately I can't get past the fabulous French, (crouqe madame). The only downside if any was a young lady who I assume is a server with pigtails and glasses seemed a little frustrated when I entered to order food at 20 minutes until closing, she made a point to look at the clock when I was standing at the register, when I asked if there was enough time to dine, she responded, \"yeah you got 20 minutes\".",

The pineapple mint limeade and chia limeade were also very refreshing on the hot summer day. Ambience is urban modern. Roomy area for self-seating and very chill atmosphere.  Service was great and knowledgeable about menu selections.  Give it a try.",

Ordered two chilaquiles, set of pancakes, and Eggs Benny (chefs special).   My cousin did not like the Eggs Benny I went told the cashier that they were not to par. Was not offered a refund only option was an additional item.   I requested a refund, solved no problem.   Go back to finish our meal, my aunt was sharing her chilaquiles with my little cousin, and she pulls this long piece of hair from her mouth. With instant disgust, we gathered our items and left.   I am extremely disappointed, and a bit embarrassed as I raved about this place heavily to all my family and friends.",

I went again yesterday to meet up with dear friends who are moving to Long Beach.  I spied a lot of delicious options but decided on the Croques Madame.  It's a classic French recipe that added the twist of Noble Bread's 7-grain toast as the base.  The nuttiness of the bread, combined quite nicely with the healthy helping of toasted  Gruyere cheese, bechamel sauce, lean ham, and an egg, to create a satisfying brunch entree .  It was the BEST version of this dish I've ever had!  This place is always hopping and the staff is pleasant and efficient.  The seating is comfortable and the patrons are laid back and satisfied.  All of these things combined make for a great experience!  I am definitely putting this on the regular rotation!",
