    "text": "Before today I had only one experience with Indian food.  It came in the form of an eating challenge in New York City.  It was fun but not very tasty and left me with a flaming mouth and weak bowels.  A friend wanted to try and Indian place in her neck of the woods.  I checked Yelp and saw that the reviews for this place were bad so I mentioned The Dhaba.  The reviews were good, I always wanted to try it and it's right across the street from my place.    Very happy we dropped by.  The restaurant was on the small side but had enough tables to accommodate anyone that dropped by.  The decor was nice and I especially liked the metal water glasses.  Very cool.  I ordered garlic naan and a lamb curry dish.  The naan was fantastic and the lamb was great.  The naan provided a great way to scoop up the excess curry.  For my beverage I selected a tasty Indian beer.  My friend ordered a veggie sandwich stuffed with potatoes that she really enjoyed.  She also ordered little bits of chicken tenders.  These were fantastic.  The breading was good and the chicken had a little kick.  If you check in you will get a free desert.  However I was not offered a choice.  It was mandatory rice pudding.  It's not what I wanted but since it was free I made no complaint.  I could take or leave the rice pudding.  Service was prompt and attentive.    Be prepared to spend some money.  The Dhaba isn't cheap.  Our bill came in just under $50.  It's not the type of place I can afford to eat at on a regular basis but it's fantastic for a special occasion.  If you're a fan of Indian food or looking for something new, I don't think The Dhaba will disappoint.",

    "text": "I wrote a review for this last week, but just realized that I should have posted it here, rather than under \"Indian Plaza.\"  I have been here three times, and each time I wonder how I have lasted so long without this food. Just last week I had a lunch special (a very good deal) that came with a drink, mango lettuce salad, the best freshly baked naan bread I've ever had, mint yogurt sauce, rice, lentils, and my main entree of vegetarian dumplings in a creamy tomato sauce. Delicious! I was completely full, but I didn't feel gross like some American restaurants leave me feeling. I still had room for some hot chai tea made from scratch. It was perfect just as it was, without any sweetener.  The first time I went our server was nice but not so attentive; this last week the service was excellent. I never had an empty glass, and our food was quick to arrive. The ambience is intimate - a great place to go on a date or catch up with an old friend.  This is a True Tempe treasure!",

Was that necessary?  Lovely atmosphere and the staff is attentive. We ordered the plate specials.  Mine came with naan, chicken curry, chana masala, dahl and rice.    The rice is like a fried rice with various veggies in it.  A nice change from the usual.  We both ordered medium spicy and it was just right.  Had the food been any spicier, it would have ruined the taste.  Hubby had the naan, lamb curry, dahl, tandoori chicken and rice.  It was all delicious.  Our meal was complete with chai and rice pudding with a mango flavoring.  There was plenty of  leftovers for the next day.  We would definitely go back as we thought this was one of the best places for Indian food.",

Upon walking into to nearly empty restaurant, we were seated and told our server would be with us. Once she discovered we had the Groupon, she told us they didn't accept them on this day because it was a holiday. We promptly left.   Once in our car we checked the Groupon and discovered that New Year's Day was not one of the days listed as a day the coupon would not be accepted. So what the heck?   This is our second time at the Dhaba. After receiving shoe-leather lamb and being told it was always cooked that way, we almost didn't want to give it a second chance. After not being able to use a perfectly good coupon on day not listed in the fine print, we will not be returning to the Dhaba.    We'll eat at Star of India on Chandler Blvd. instead. The lamb there is cooked to perfection.",

    "text": "The Dhaba is the Indian restaurant that I frequent almost monthly. Yes, I order the same two dishes all the time because they're very good. Chicken Tikka Masala and Butter chicken. (They're soo good!) Unfortunately, here they pretty much taste the same. It's not the best Indian food I've ever eaten, but it sure is one of the better Indian restaurants in the Valley. I've also tried the Spinach chicken/Saag. Was pretty disappointed (came out very bland and no spice at all). Maybe it was an off night for this. Consistency is very important to me in a restaurant and usually this place delivers. 4 stars for creating tasty food and great Naan overall, but lacking that extra deliciousness for a perfect score.    Service is good. You will have multiple servers throughout your dining experience. This is often a good thing! The downside: there's usually a long wait on the weekends. Very long wait! If you're on the fence about trying it, I'd say just go for it! You'll most likely enjoy it! At least I keep coming back for more...",

    "text": "I am pretty new to Indian cuisine. I have only had it a few times at parties, or events at work. I have liked most of what I have tried. A few months ago Groupon offered a deal for The Dhaba, and based on a recommendation from a friend I decided to take advantage of the offer. Guess What? I totally forgot  until a day or two before the offer ran out. So, I quickly got a group together and made reservations for Thursday night which was the final night of the offer.   When we arrived it was apparent that I was not the only doofus that waited until the last night. The restaurant was packed, and people were outside waiting. The hostess was actually turning people without  reservation away. I was so glad that I had made a reservation, because we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. The downside was that we waited over 20 minutes for a server to come to our table.  My group decided to order three appetizers and three main dishes.   Appetizers: * Paneer pakora * Punjabi murgh (chicken) pakora * Punjabi vegetable platter featuring veggie and paneer pakora.  THE WINNER: The Punjabi vegetable platter.  We laughed saying they tasted like Bloomin' Onions only different. The chicken was also very good, but the paneer pakora was a bit bland.  Main Entrees:  * Dhaba chicken korma  * Dhaba lamb curry * Achari lamb.   THE WINNER: Dhaba Chicken korma.  It was so creamy and had a rich nutty flavor. I felt bad. I really didn't want to share.  Both of the lamb dishes were good, but I found them to be excessively salty. The Achari Lamb was way to spicy for my taste.  The service was ok given that they were understaffed and extremely busy, but I will let this slide since I waited until the last night to use the Groupon deal. I will tell you. I am a Dhaba fan, and I will definitely go back.",

Order one chaat (street snack) and two curry dishes, one goat , one spinach chicken. They were good but a little lack in term of favor ...  I think it is cater toward American taste. I didn't see any desi people in this place other than my friend ... this is certainly a sign of its authenticity  Also their naan has too much butter on it ... not exactly my taste  Service is a bit on the slow side but overall good.  Nice stop if you are close to the area but if you want better chaat, try little india.  Or some good indian food, try indian paradise (north valley) Don't forget to check in on yelp, they have check-in offer.  I got a free dessert of kheer (rice pudding)",

The restaurant is very small, so I would definitely recommend reservations. Though small it had a great ambiance, and the presentation was just lovely. Their varieties of chutneys were delicious and they had a great selection of Indian foods that are not so common to find in restaurants. We ordered several appetizers, a couples of entrees, and a few desserts and absolutely everything was delicious, fresh, and well prepared. The wait staff was friendly and attentive, and a gentlemen who seemed to be the owner checked in with us towards the end of the meal to make sure our experience was satisfactory.

Little hollowed out puffed pastries stuffed with potatoes and chick peas, which you pour tamarind flavored water on. Although the flavors were there, they didn't work well together.   For the main course we got the Dhaba chicken curry with aromatic basmati rice and some garlic naan. This dish was delicious. The chicken was boneless and tender, the curry was rich with spices and heat. The garlic naan was fresh and pillowy and worked great with the curry. The serving size was perfect for two to share, and we even had enough to take home!  Great atmosphere, they even had a guy playing a sitar in the front of the restaurant! This restaurant is located in the India Plaza, next to a Indian grocery store, parking seems really scarce though, and make sure you make a reservation, they get booked!",

    "text": "I always enjoy a sqaure deal, and today was no exception. Having a shiny new restaurant*com coupon in hand, we made our way out for The Dhaba. I'm not too proud to partake in a coupon here and there. Let's face it, why pay $40 when you can spend $25 after tax and generous tip? Now that's smart shopping.  This place was a good decision. We really enjoyed the food, they're in a nice spot right off the light rail, they've got a cool Indian (dot - not feather) market and adjacent shops to check out before, or after, your meal.   The Adrak De Panje dish (marinated lamb cooked in the tandoor for those of you who don't know); while tasty, was a bit tougher than I was expecting. They could stand to provide a sharper knife with this item. I was here with my wife and mother-in-law and we all really enjoyed the Nawabi Murg Tikke (marinated chicken cooked in the tandoor).  Overall they serve great tasting food and India themed decor. The restaurant dining area echoed on the inside, which made for an interesting experience. We could literally hear what our neighbors were talking about. While they did have music it could have been a bit louder, felt like we could hear every conversation from all the surrounding tables. and I expect that this could have been overcome with ambiance level music or some interior curtains.  At one of the shops, we met an interesting and awesome guy behind the counter, my guess is that he's the owner. He told us about different spices and dietary info about different Indian foods. Had a fun evening learning about Indian foods!  Happy Yelping Phoenix! .... errr Tempe I guess. ;-)",

Sadly the management's inability (reluctance?) to honor the remaining balance on our Dhaba gift card left a sour taste at the end of the evening. Their excuse was that their machine wasn't working although they were able confirm that we had a balance of $5.68, but told us we would need to come back some other time and use it.  Hopefully it will be better in 2016.",

Nan - perfectly cooked with great char Chicken Tika Masala - excellent complex flavors (our favorite of the meal) Lamb Curry - ordered medium, which means spicy, but very tasty Okra - dry fried with perfectly camamelized onions  They also have an Indian grocery and shop next door, and extra parking in the back too.",

It was very bland and dry with no appreciable amount of spice on it. The platter on which it was brought out was burning the Tikka. The things started getting worse from there.  The sauce with the entree lacked any spice or color. Seemed like tomatoes and some spices were put in a blender, churned and served with peas and paneer. Chicken biryani was nowhere close to a biryani with some generic spices mixed with rice and chicken. And the final nail in the coffin was the exorbitantly priced items. Safe to say, this will be the first and last time, I visit this place.",

    "text": "Disgustingly, disturbingly, delusionally delicious. I'm not an expert in Indian cuisine. More of a point-to-a-random-dish-and-hope-I-like-it type of dude. So I can't measure this up against Indian places in London, or go into detail about its authenticity. I have no standing to be a pretentious prick here.  But where my expertise in Indian cuisine is limited, my experience in eating is very well developed. I have been practicing the appreciation of eating for nearly 27 years. I devote hours every day to food. I practice three times a day minimum. I am a disciplined eater. At times I eat four, five, even six times a day. My dedication is unsurpassed. Sometimes I punish my body to the point where I am nearly puking, because I want to be the best. I am driven, focused, a real go-getter. If eating was a profession, I would have a Ph.D. If the moon was actually made of cheese, I would be Elon Musk, and I would eat that shit. Ocean tides are overrated, give me that moon cheese. Point is, I'm good at eating. Respect my authority.  And what does this authority say about The Dhaba? It's fucking delicious. It's a tongue tickler. A mouth party. I am actually drooling writing this, just giant slobbery drips of saliva pouring out of my slackened jaw like a hungry, retarded St. Bernard. That is the effect The Dhaba will have on you. The faint memory of it will conjure up a memories and feelings from somewhere deep and ancient in the brain, from the lizard parts that mix and mingle food pleasure with other primal urges.  What I'm saying is that thinking of The Dhaba's food makes me want to take it from behind and have my way with it.  I don't think I can be more clear. Go have a foodgasm while it's still legal.",

The menu is complex and is probably a little daunting if you have not eaten in an Indian restaurant before. If this is your first trip to an Indian restaurant have the waiter or waitress suggest a few dishes for you. We ordered an almost all-meat appetizer that included chicken, shrimp and some peppers and onions. It was a perfect start to a great meal. We paired this with a lovely bottle of Pinot noir that was really smooth and light. We followed this with a mango chicken, goat curry, a spinach dish, garlic naan, basmati rice and raita. The three main dishes complemented each other perfectly. We only ordered the curry at a level six hotness and we could probably have gone to an eight. The owner came out and asked us how everything was and we had a very pleasant chat with him. We were the last people left in the restaurant as it was after 9 pm when we were finishing out chai tea and complimentary rice pudding and doughnuts.  One of the best Indian meals I have eaten and definitely a place I will return to.",

    "text": "This place isn't bad. The atmosphere is nice, and the staff seems friendly enough, but they are getting three stars for a couple reasons.  First when we finally ordered, it took quite a while for our food to come out. Also when we ordered, we ordered some drinks... Normally those would come out before the food...? So, yeah, when our food came out and we still didn't have drinks, I had to ask twice for them.  Second, I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masalla, one of my all time favorite Indian dishes, if done right. This dish came out under seasoned, no real flavor whatsoever... plus I really like spicy food, so I ordered it as a 10 (scale of 1 to 10)... Unfortunately it didn't taste like they had done anything to spice it up.  Last, the rice pudding was... ok. However, they apparently leave whole cardamon seeds in there, and I happen to bite full on into one thinking it was one of the nuts in the pudding. My wife had some ice-cream desert that tasted like a Mango Lassie, but it was so rock solid and in a dish that just didn't work. Trying to dig pieces of the ice-cream off ended with the entire puck (that's about what it looked like) flying out of the small bowl they put it in.  On the plus side, the Garlic Naan was fabulous... in fact we got a second order of it...   Anyhow, I doubt I'll come back here again, especially if I can find a much better Indian place closer to Chandler...",

    "text": "I am traveling for work, and wanted to check out a local place.  This got good reviews in yelp, so I went.   First, the parking.  The parking in front was tiny.  I had to park behind the building and walk around to the front.  Not a big deal, during the day.  But at night, a little sketchy.  For the safety of the customers, there should be a safer entry from the back parking lot, OR fix the parking in the front.   Next, the service.  Service was poor.  I was barely talked to - three times to be exact.  Once, when the waiter took my order and then again to drop off my check.  He literally talked to me twice, and neither of those times was to ask if my food was ok, etc.  There was someone who was dropping off the food to the tables.  She literally dropped my food off and then left.  She talked to me  a bit later (third and final time), but only because she had to.  I flagged her down to tell her that my Roti was wrong (who puts butter on Roti?).  But that's not all... even after my Roti issue was resolved, I realized that my dinner (Dil Bahar Korma?) was wrong.  But since my server never came back, I couldn't tell him, and I couldn't get his attention. I thought about trying to explain to the girl who fixed my Roti, but the truth was that I was so hungry and annoyed, that I just ate it. AND IT WAS REALLY GOOD.  No doubt.  But again, not what I ordered.  Now, the cost.  I paid $15 for a vegetarian dish (2-2.5 cups total with sauce/veg) and maybe 2 cups rice.  Other places I have been to you get more than that and for less than the cost here.  $2-3 for Roti?  $3 is a bit high, but whatever.  A side of Raita is $5?  How about $2.5-3?  Finally, I have to comment on my appetizer (Rehriwale Dahi Bhalle?  it wasn't clearly noted on the receipt).  I wanted a pakora appetizer, but the waiter told me about a delicious croquette thing.  Sounded interesting, so I got it.  When it arrived, the dish looked like an ice cream sundae with chickpeas.  There was something at the bottom of the bowl, presumably the croquette, but it was drowning in so much sauce (yogurt sauce, tamarind chutney, mint sauce) and chickpeas, I really couldn't tell.  Honestly, the presentation was unappetizing and it was odd trying to eat something that I couldn't see...  It did taste pretty good, though, but not good enough for a $8 price tag.     I want to emphasize that the food was very tasty - kudos to the chef.  But the service was awful - rude, even.  And the prices are just too high for what you actually get.  I'd be less upset with the prices if I had more food to come home with.",

    "text": "This was another Groupon find of mine, although I had heard about it (in a not so good light) from a friend. However, I do love me some Indian food, so I grabbed my partner and headed over there.  The Groupon was for $40, and at most places, if get get apps, food, dessert and iced tea, we hit that mark. Not here. We each order the fanciest Thali they had (comes with salad, naan, biranyi rice, desser, chai, mini mango lassis, dal and two veggie dishes), but they were only $15 a piece, so we wound up ordering two more starters (the potato pancake Chaat and fried Paneer) in order to hit our price point. And then we took a LOT of food home.  The mango lassis were delicious, as was the salad.  I wasn't such a fan of the chaat - it was a little too spicy and a little too mushy. I loved the fried Paneer, but who doesn't love fried cheese? It was great with the tamarind chutney.  As far as the main meal, I loved everything (though next time, will go with plain basmati rice). I especially enjoyed the paneer tikka masala and the malai kofta, my favorite dish ever. The dal was good -- I've never seen kidney beans in it before, but I liked it. The only thing I didn't absolutely love was the Saag Paneer - the texture was too smooth. However, my partner scarfed it down.  For dessert, I was expecting rice pudding, or the sweet balls. Instead, our awesome server asked if we'd tried carrot fudge. We hadn't, so she brought that out.  I liked it, except for the sultana raisins (I hate raisins). It didn't hit the spot for my partner though, and the chai wasn't as strongly spiced as I like (plus I prefer honey to sugar packets as far as sweetening it).  We'll be back, for sure. I might go with a small thali, but it's a really good deal, and an excellent amount of good food for the value. Glad I found it!",

    "text": "Now with so many good things going for it, I did leave The Dhaba slightly indifferent. You see when I order and eat, I'm pretty much a total top. While I am open to suggestion, I have a good idea of what I want and how I want it. During my visit, not only was I flipped but I didn't have much say in the matter. Please don't get me wrong, our server was friendly however, every time when one of us ordered something, he would tell us that he would order something better for us to enjoy. For me, I was dead set on ordering several wraps and rolls called Sada Bahar, what I ended up with was far from what I originally envisioned. While I did get my way with a few appetizers, I have to say not only was I pleased with his domineering ordering selections, but would eagerly let him order again for me.  Street food called chaat, is to Indian cooking as dim sum is to Chinese. Usually a small plate with around 3 servings varying in preparation, and with enough variety to make a meal out of. Starting with the Amritsri Samosa Chaat ($6); these are a deep fried triangular dumpling filled with a mixture of potatoes, onions and chili, served with a spicy yogurt sauce. Perfectly crunchy and not a drop of oil, just breaking into one of them was a delight as the fragerent steam escaped, it was aromatherapy Indian style.  Ambala Tiki Chaat ($6) was more of a composed small plate. A couple of potato pancakes, layered with garbanzo beans, onions, and garnished with fresh mint & tamarind chutney and yogurt. The flavor components with Indian cooking are generally very complex, this plate was a great example of complexity and harmony. Each bite had varying degrees of spicy and sweet then a slightly sour finish from the chutney.  Complexity doesn't quite work like with the Kolkata Pani Puri ($6). These are round hollows, fried crisp and served with a watery mixture of tamarind, chili and potatoes. The idea is to spoon in some of the mixture into each puri, then pop into your mouth. While the texture was nice, the flavors just never came together and ended up just tasting weird.  This is the part where he took over and assured us what he was ordering was going to be quite good. As the dishes came out we weren't quite sure what was what, so we just dug in. Eventually we got clarity and just continued to share, family style.  Arriving on a sizzling iron skillet covered with peppers and onions, the Chicken Tikka Kabob ($11) was not only a dramatic presentation coming from the kitchen, but the colors were vivid and bright. Large pieces of boneless/skinless chicken breast are rubbed with spices then grilled, resulting in a beautiful yellow color. The chicken was tender and moist yet had a slight smokiness that added another welcome dimension.  Served in a large basket were piles of hot freshly baked naan ($3 per order). The thick and tender bread was a welcome site since I was wanting a wrap to begin with. Plain, garlic and chili each flavor welcomes dipping, wrapping and scooping of sauces and meats.  Loving yogurt, the creamy tang of the Kashmiri Chicken Tikka Masala ($10) was a welcome surprise. This is where the naan really came into play by making good use of the tender pieces of chicken and yogurt sauce. Sopping up as much of the delicious sauce as I could, interactivity is just part of the experience.  With so many different spices and spiciness, the Mango Lassi ($3) was as welcome as the rain. Yogurt and water mixed with sugar and mango was cooling and refreshing. With the addition of a fruit puree on the inside of the glass, made this version different than others Ive tried, though the effect was still the same.  At the end of the meal we were brought out a bowl of rice pudding with a scoop of pistachio ice cream. While the sliced dates and papaya were pretty to look at, none of the flavors made much sense together. Complaining aside, this did arrive complimentary. Who knows, maybe for being a good sports?  We were also brought out another off menu item, it was a thick, flaky and buttery paratha. Similar to a flour tortilla, this particular version was filled with pureed cherry and sprinkled with anise seeds. After only one taste we were hooked. The group of us made short order of the warm tender layers. You might have to ask for this one to be made special. Our server actually told us how soldiers in the hills of Afghanistan, would make these since it didn't take to many ingredients or tools. He stared blankly out the window as he told the story, perhaps of his own personal experience building make shift clay ovens?  Alright, so sometimes letting go can be a hard thing to do. After this experience, its actually kind of nice sitting back and enjoying the surprises the kitchen has in store.",

    "text": "First up, certainly not the best Indian food in the city. Having said that, not bad either if you are in the vicinity. I'm obviously picky about this cuisine as its native to me but I also know I won't get close to tasty food here. Having said that, it's good if you want to try Indian food. I had the chaat, not authentic but refreshing. Little India in Tempe has better flavor. For the main course had the saag murgh ( spinach chicken) and goat curry. The goat was better. The dessert however was quite good. Got the Kheer ( rice pudding) which was very flavorful. The ambience is nice, the service a little slow but the staff quite friendly but not sure how well they know their stuff.  You won't be disappointed by your experience but you won't come back blown away either.",

    "text": "I've been to a few Indian restaurants here in the valley - namely Jewel of the Crown, Al Hamra, Tandoori Times, Bombay Spice Grill & Wine (not really Indian), Indian Paradise, and Kabab Palace - and Dhaba is definitely my favorite so far. I'm no stranger to the cuisine having travelled/lived in India & Bangladesh for a couple of years, and this place seems to have nailed the perfect balance of flavor, spice, variety, ambiance, price, and service. The hostess/server was warm and knowledgeable, the bussers were attentive (my water was always at least  full), and the food was delicious. A little Americanized, perhaps, but muted authenticity didn't affect the taste or my dining experience at all. I highly recommend getting the garlic naan and goat curry (ask for additional heat; it can be a little sweet otherwise). And good ol' chicken tikka masala for first-timers. Will be back for sure.",

Their food is the best, and most authentic Punjab, in the Valley.  This visit we had five adults and the entire bill was just $75.00!  Crazy reasonable!  The paneer was excellent, the mango chicken yummy and the lamb was so mouth-watering!  Their garlic naan is great.  We skipped dessert tonight, but last visit had their rice pudding.  Yum!  After we left the restaurant we got a telephone call from them saying that \"the gentlemen sitting on the end of the table dropped $15.00 and we needed to come back for our money\".   He'd never have known the dfference if they hadn't called us, so we were extremely impressed with this kindness and honesty!!  All-in-all a great experience once again.",

As a server I think this situation is disgusting and contacted the US Department of Labor, Arizona office.  They do think this is an issue that would need to be addressed, but cannot do anything unless an effected employee contacts them.  Their phone number is 602-514-7100.

We went for dinner on Sunday, making reservations on-line.  When we walked in, our table was ready with glasses of water filled and papadums and chutneys waiting for us.  We were greeted quickly, drink orders taken (my girlfriend loves their hot chai).   They didn't hover around the table while we were deciding, as it generally takes a while to go through their extensive menu.  It's a nice, subtle reminder that they appreciate your business AND want you to enjoy yourself.    We ordered a spinach and chickpea curry and a spicy lamb curry with mangoes and capsicum, with a side of garlic naan.  All delicious (I normally get the chicken vindaloo but decided to try something a little bit different). The naan is fantastic, I also have had the chili naan and it's an excellent compliment, if you want to keep piling the spice on (and I do).   We ended the meal with gulab jamun, perfect for two people.     We never go away from the Dhaba hungry, we're always satisfied, and we always recommend it to our friends.  It's hands down my favorite restaurant in the Valley.",

They said we could ask for the other basmati if we still wanted it later. We felt cheated because we paid for two basmati and expected two basmati without having to ask for more. This place is really expensive, too, and for them to try and cheat people out of rice is just not right.

    "text": "The Dhaba has been on my wife's list for a long time, and I'm glad she finally convinced me to go, because it was amazing.  I'm not that familiar with Indian cuisine, and the dinner menu at Dhaba is extensive, so it took a while to figure things out.    Tip:  Make a reservation.  We did and were sat immediately at a table marked \"reserved\".  We noted several parties who arrived while we were having dinner who did not make reservations and were actually turned away entirely.  MAKE A RESERVATION.    I had a double deuce Indian beer called Kingfisher that was enjoyable, ordered a chaat and pakoras for the table to start (don't remember which ones and I don't see either of them on the online menu unfortunately), and the shehenghahi palak kofta for my main course, along with a Jantar Mantar (assortment of four kinds of naan bread) for the table.     Meanwhile, they bring out a plate with papadums and the three chutneys ranging from sweet/mild to medium/hot to hot/hot.  The hot hot was very hot, and my favorite was the sweet/mild which I believe was a tamarind.   All were delicious.    We actually asked for a second cup of the tamarind chutney it went so quickly.    The chaat was chick peas in a sauce with a naan bread-like base under the sauce and it was incredible.  Very tasty and not at all spicy.  It might have been the samosa chaat, but I'm not sure.  Either way, we all loved it.    The pakora \"street treat\" came in a pair and was also quite delicious.  They're like fritters, and actually fairly large for what they are.  We found ourselves spreading some of the tamarind chutney on them as well.    Next was my shehenghahi palak kofta \"fit for royalty\" vegetarian dish.   I really am not even sure how to describe this dish other than a heavy green sauce with cheese dumplings in it.   The flavor was out of this world!   I decided to man up and ordered it at a 6 out of 10 spice level.  I enjoy spicy food, and 6 out of 10 made me sweat.  It was very hot.  Definitely cleared out my sinuses haha.   What I find amazing is that they can adjust the heat level without impacting flavor.  I would order this same exact dish again, but take it down to a 4 on the spice level and I think I'd truly enjoy it.  I highly recommend this dish.    We all also enjoyed the Jantar Mantar assortment of naan breads and it was a huge portion for the 3 of us!  We ended up taking most of the naan home.     My one beer, my wife's 2 glasses of wine, step daughter's special Dhaba lemonade, 2 apps, 3 entrees, an extra side of rice and the assortment of naan breads came to a total of about $105.   If we had stuck to water, it would have put it in the $$ range but with the drinks it was definitely in the $$$ range....and WORTH IT.     Next time we go, I'll try desert if there's room in the belly!   We had a ton of leftovers to take home this time around.  Like a full 2nd meal for 3 people worth of leftovers....",

It came with rice, Naan (I upgraded to garlic) and side salad and a side, I got the yogurt over the lentils.   The Chicken Tikka was perfect, the tandoori chicken was tender, the sauce robust and thick but not greasy. I asked for mine as a level 5 (they ask 1-10) for spiciness and it had some kick but was a perfect heat for me. The rice white is a white/brown combo was moist and the perfect compliment.    The little side salad was nothing special, a little iceberg and some chopped carrots but the dressing was really a standout. I asked what it was and they said it was \"house made\" with mango, mustard, and spices. This dressing has a kick and dressed up (pun intended) the boring little salad.   The yogurt sauce I ordered because it came with the meal, but I ended up eating the whole thing and mixing some with the Marsala.  It's was very very good.   Naan, awesome awesome too.   I will definitely go back for lunch here again and maybe dinner (it's close to work but far from home). The service was very very prompt and there aren't many tables and they weren't slammed for lunch but they were steady so there might be a wait, I would imagine dinner may be busier than lunchtime here.  Perfect portion and cost for a good lunch at $16.",

    "text": "We usually eat Indian food at a buffet in Mesa, but an Indian friend took me to Dhaba and it was amazing.   I took my family soon after and they were impressed too. The meat was more tender than what we usually get at our favorite buffet. (Not saying our favorite place is not great.  It's the best buffet I have ever been to and I usually hate buffets.)  The naan was very good, but kind of expensive for such a small amount.    Almost every dish was absolutely wonderful.  We ordered lamb vindaloo, lamb curry and chicken curry.   I also ordered something that was supposed to have cubed potatoes and spinach.  It was tasty, but there were hardly any potatoes and it was really just spinach.   Being that I am not Indian and am still learning about the foods I like, I would find it helpful to have images (I realize that sounds silly) or better descriptions.  No one in my party wanted to touch the spinach plate because it looked weird, but I thought it was delicious--just did not want to eat the whole thing.  Being that I do not know what to order, I will probably stick with our usual buffet because I can tell by looking at the dish if I will like it.  The waitress was not great at understanding my questions about menu items.    Still, the food was good, and I will probably visit with my Indian friend again because the stuff she ordered was great.",

It was very disappointing .  - We had set up a reservation at 8:00 PM and when we reach there the lady probably the owner says that we have just 30 mins to make all the orders and they take the last order only till 8:30 . We had to rush through the appetizers , main course , drinks and desserts .  -Service was very poor . The lady was cocky and wasn't pleasant at all . The waiter who came to serve had no idea where to keep the food and was literally giving the plate of naan to us and was not even bothered to take the finished plates off the table   -  Coming to the food . Now I've seen a lot of 5 star reviews for this restaurant . I feel it is the worst food for the price you are paying . Every dish was mediocre and costs atleast 15$    We ordered Paneer , Butter chicken and some lamb curry . ALL THE CURRIES TASTED ABSOLUTELY THE SAME . There was no salt and the base gravy was the same for all three . And they add too much color in their food    - I ordered Butter naan , and what I got was just some hard \"naan\" which had absolutely no  butter in it . The naan was really hard and in 5 minutes it became rock solid . The gobi parathas were under-cooked   If I could give this place Zero stars I would have done that . Not even one dish was worth eating . It is just a n overpriced place that serves poor quality food . Now a lot of people here might like it but being an Indian and knowing what actual Indian food tastes like , I feel the restaurant is a big disaster only good enough to burn a hole in your pocket . There is just too much hype about this place in all these websites .   The food is not even average and I would advice everyone to PLEASE NOT GO TO THIS PLACE . You have other Indian restaurants in Tempe , they are far better and cheaper . THIS IS AN OVERATED PLACE . FOOD IS POOR QUALITY , PRICEY and NOT AUTHENTIC  . It is just not worth it",

Taking advantage of Restaurant Week, we were able to thoroughly enjoy a both esthetic and flavorful, if not flamboyant trip to India within The Dhaba's culinary and decor environment!  The moment you arrive, you are struck by their museum-like front displaying glass encased ornaments, clothing and more such as kurtis with Phulkari - and exhibited are Indian Auto Rickshaws showing both incredible intricate hand-made design and real wear!  And, the as you enter the front door, you set foot into a very traditional and very authentic environment seeming to take you back in time to Raj also known as the British India period!  Keep in mind this area of the world dates its heritage and cuisine to the Indus Valley Civilization (dating as far back as 1900 BCE).  This Northern Indian Cuisine which boasts Pakistani influences (Pakistan borders Punjab) drives its influence in their incredible foods.  Both my wife and I enjoyed everything we tried, quite a bit.  The prices are very reasonable, considering the hefty portions they dish (which in many instances will require boxes for take-home!), and the quality and adherence to authenticity The Dhaba offers.  Regarding the food, starting with my wife's white wine and I a large bottle of Taj Mahal Beer, we then took the opportunity to try starting with their: Samosa Plate (very refreshing and unique salad), freshly baked Naan Bread; my wife had the Cashmiri Chicken Tikka Masala (chicken breast marinated in traditional spices and yogurt and prepared in a Tandoori) while I had the exquisite and tender rendition of the Lamb Curry (lamb cubes with Dhaba spices) we finished off with deserts of Badami Kheer and wonderful Indian Rice Pudding, and I had the Gulab Gamun (spongy milky balls in rose syrup!  As I mentioned, by far the best we've had in the area.  Highly recommended to Aficionados and newbies to Punjab alike!  Great atmosphere, attention, service, price and quality... a very enjoyable experience - we'll be back!  Bon appetit from Gastro Eclectico.         ('you will enjoy your meal').",

It came as a 7 - spicy, flavorful but not as hot as I would have liked. Still very good, but the portion had too many potatoes and not enough lamb. I am willing to pay $17 for an entree with lamb, it is a rare treat. While tasty, the portion was very skimpy.  My wife's dish was delicious. And ironically seemed spicier than mine.

We finally figured out what we wanted, and ordered from our cute waitress.  We got the chana masala, palak paneer, and mutter paneer. For breads we got garlic naan and something else with a sweet taste.  The food was average at best, and the portion sizes were extremely small.  I had a Groupon for $30 for $60, and I can see the Groupon covering up the lack of quantity.

Lots of naan; garlic and plain to dip into the sauce of my chicken tikka masala!!!   Took my husband there last night for his first time trying Indian food. He got one of the grilled items Murgh Seekh Kabab. The herbs and spices were really strong and probably not a good choice for a first timer. The owners recognized that he didn't eat any if it and took it off our bill. They sincerely apologized and told is to ask them for advice the next time we go there.",

The service was still great and they switched out a dish for us but the overall food quality was lacking.  I'm guessing only the Thalis here are good as a person in our group ordered one of those and it was good",

For entrees, I tried the murgh (chicken) biryani and the boneless chicken tandoori (marinated in yogurt & spices). For dessert, we tried the gulab jamun (pardon the spelling errors).   Now, why the 3 stars? The prices, and sometimes skimping on ingredients...ufff my chicken tandoori dish is described to come with a bed of onions and green/bell peppers! There were no peppers!!! There were 1-2 pieces that are too small to be noticed! I told the lady and she ended up bringing me a side of green peppers! Ok!  Whatever!!! But you know why that's a problem??? The dish is $15, and it came only with like 6 chicken pieces, all onions (no peppers, originally...see above), and no naan or rice! I spent another $3 on the naan, and I ended up ordering the small dish of yogurt (raita) to make the meal less dry! You know how much that yogurt was?? $4. So I spent $22 on my 6 pieces of chicken meal and the naan and yogurt!!  Gee thanks guys!! You guys could keep that tandoori to yourself! Next time I'll order a biryani for $14 and have enough food for 2-3 meals!! (It comes with complimentary raita too.. Now that's a deal)",

The waitresses weren't that personable and although the lunch special includes dessert, they asked my friends if they still wanted it.  Huh? I didn't have a lunch special, so I used my handy dandy Yelp check in offer for a free dessert, so I could get some rice pudding.  I've been eating rice pudding all my life and have had many different versions.  Liquidy rice pudding? No thanks.  Thank God we had a terrific birthday cake.",

The lamb is always fork tender (other Indian restaurants have a tendency to serve tough or chewy lamb) and the fiery vindaloo never fails to satisfy my craving for spicy food. We've also tried their chicken curry, korma, tikka masala, aloo palak, palak paneer, naan (garlic and plain), and various deserts. The meats are always cooked perfectly and the flavors of the sauces (spicy or not) are fantastic. Their wine list is decent, and pairing suggestions are offered. The selection of Indian beers is good, and an Indian beer is a fantastic way to subdue the fire on your palate from spicy Indian food. We never leave the Dhaba disappointed. The service is friendly. If you have questions about flavors or spice, just ask and they will take the time to help you through the menu. We have recommended the Dhaba to many people and will continue to do so.",

Never had such great service like that before!  The serverware in general were very exotic and noticeably increased my enjoyment of dinner.  We got the chicken tikka masala and a lamb dish (just ask for their most popular one, it had tomato based sauce).  The meats were very tender, not overly dry and the sauces were perfect.  They weren't overly skimpy on the meat like some other places too.  The garlic naan was great with the entrees.  The prices are a bit high so I would recommend getting a Groupon if available.  Lunch isn't so bad for pricing but I'm not sure about their portion size.",

When we arrived at 6:00, our table was set and waiting for us. The restaurant is nicely decorated, and has a quiet atmosphere. Some of the smaller, intimate tables would be a good place to take a date! But, I digress.  For starters, they brought out a very thin, fragile cracker and 3 different sauces to dip it in. The sauces are not for the faint hearted. I recommend that you order a mango lassi immediately if you need to handle heat.  For starters, I ordered the samosa's, and they were flavorful and cooked to perfection. An assortment of main dishes were ordered ranging from Chicken Tikka Masala to Lamb Vindaloo ordered extra hot, along with a melange of other dishes.  While the heat level might be good for most people, I and one of my companions really like the heat, and we felt that the Tikka Masala and the Vindaloo needed to be even hotter than they were. Then again, a member of our party tried each one of them and pronounced their mouth to be on fire, so perhaps we just have asbestos linings. This restaurant is beautifully clean, including the restrooms.  There is a small store attacked to the restaurant that has everything from ingredients to nicknacks for sale.  Each person in our party enjoyed the dinner, and there was narry a complaint about anything. Service was attentive without being overbearing.  4 stars for quality, cleanliness and service.",

The dish was seasoned heavily, like any Indian dish should be, but the flavors didn't really seem to balance out  very well, all of the seasonings tasted a bit off, and were a bit overbearing in a funny tasting way.  But alas, not bad by any means of the imagination.  I cleaned off the plate and would try it again.  The shrimp itself was wonderful, very fresh and well cooked.  The garlic naan was to die for, it was one of the best naans I've ever had.  Cooked to perfection.   Judging from other reviews, I'm not sure if we just came in on an off night or what, but the service was not good at all.  We were probably sitting for 15-20 minutes before someone came over and took our drink orders, and this was not on a busy night.  Our server didn't seem particularly happy to be there.  The food took a little while to come out, but I expect that when ordering more elaborate meals, and was not at all turned off by this.    The restaurant has a little side-shop, which sells British and Indian goodies, which was delightful.  A definite plus.",

    "text": "Dhabas are found in India and Pakistan as roadside restaurants or 'truck stalls' serving local foods to truck drivers from the tandoori or 'clay ovens'. They generally have cots for sitting and enjoying the foods of this land. Punjabi food is a diversity of Afghanistan, Persia and Central Asia. Here at The Dhaba you will find authentic, robust, rich Punjabi food like no other I have tasted before in the valley. FINALLY this week, I was able to get my family into The Dhaba for something different!   First off, I will give you this tip: make a reservation. WE did and had no issues, we were sat at a perfectly cute table immediately upon our arrival; but many people that showed up after us waited upwards of 40 plus minutes. This place was packed until about 800pm. We also watched people that walked in get turned away with still forty or so minutes to closing and tables that were open. We made a mental note of that too! MAKE a reservation and make it not near closing if your a linger eater like we are!   The menu is very expansive. Lots and lots of Indian dishes! Some I had heard of before and some were brand new to me and I love that! Since I had not had this type of food in years, and my family maybe never, it was going to take awhile to get through this menu! One thing I liked is that there were three options of meals that came with salad, naan, dessert and a sampling of main options and range from $15-21. We started with the complimentary crisp papadums that are brought to the table with various chutneys ranging in spice from sweet to hot hot. We ended up ordering various starters and a couple of entrees to sample around the table and everything was outstanding! Samosa Chaat; Jantar Mantar, (various naan breads).. THIS is a large serving!;  a fritter like 'street treat', called Pakora; the Shehenghahi Palak Kofta, which is a vegetarian dish that is sort of like cheese type dumplings swimming in a thick curried spicy sauce. This dish had amazing flavor, BUT watch the spice level you choose or you will be clearing your sinuses for days! We also shared the Khazani Tandoori Platter, various meats including shrimp cooked in a tandoori. This was a lot of food for us and we brought a lot of it home; never a bad thing!   The Dhaba is authentic in decor and seemingly to be a family that runs it. It did take us awhile to peruse the expansive menu, as these are foods we are not familiar with and I did feel that to a small degree that we were being a little rushed to make a decision when we kept getting the waitress coming back and then the lady that appeared to be an owner, as well. I find that a tad annoying when out for dinner with my family, as we view dinner to be a social and conversational time and we do like to discuss the food. Hello, we are foodies!   All in all, I loved everything about The Dhaba from the rik rik outside, that my daughter had to snap pics of for her instagram to the decor to the plates on the table and of course, the menu. For me this is the best Indian cuisine I've had in the valley and we can't wait to come back.. BUT again, with a reservation and a bigger appetite!",

My guy and I have tried this spot twice and I know he loves it so we will be back.  The menu is ridiculously huge and nothing is a dumb downed name though they do have a description of everything.  I try the vegetarian combo (not remembering the name) that included a yummy salad, chai tea, vegetable curry, lentils, jasmine rice, and an order of naan for $15.  Seriously this place is legit!!  Why?  Food temps- hot when it's supposed to be!  Flavors- beautifully seasoned and delicious savory Indian flavors  Serving size- I pigged out and still had a full meal the next day  Authenticity- badass decor, tableware with live music sets the tone  We learned they do the last dinner seating at 8 so if you are going to get there a bit after you should call and make a reservation for 8:15.  We barely got in at 8:05 but saw another group turned away.  Yelp lists the hours until 9:30 maybe that is for the adjoining market.",

    "text": "The Dhaba is, IMO, the best place for indian food in phoenix. There are a few others who can make a decent curry, but very few who treat their meat dishes with the same care that's shown at The Dhaba. Where other comparable restaurants might have good vegetarian dishes but falter on dry chicken, The Dhaba excels with proteins. The end result is an experience that's intoxicating in its colors, smells, and tastes, and it will leave you full and happy.  SOME NOTES ON ORDERING:  1.)The Dhaba has a big menu with a lot of names on it that might be intimidating for a new customer or for someone that is entirely uninitiated with Indian (or anglicized Indian) food. Don't be intimidated: if you admit that you're new/clueless, staff will be happy to help.   2.) the dishes (as ordered) are a bit unbalanced and a bit pricey. When you order an \"entree,\" you get a bowl of curry and rice. The curry is the focal point of the meal, but truthfully, the curry is extremely rich and is as much food for 2-3 meals, provided that it's being accompanied by naan and rice. So, if you're having an entree with naan: maybe skip an appetizer. Samosas are fine, but they're also quite filling, and you might regret filling up on papadum and fried dumplings once you realize how misleadingly large the entree is.   3.) Variety is best achieved if you go with a group. It's hard to justify the expense and gluttony of getting palak paneer, chicken tikka masala, *and* lamb korma if you're just going with 1-2 people. But the more people who go, the more people can safely order whatever they want and still come away with lots of variety while still seeming sane portion-wise.  4.) Leftovers are amazing. Don't pick the meat out and leave the curry. The curry is the whole point. Take some home with you and have it on rice/naan the following day. Garlic naan in a toaster oven will make your house smell amazing. And the smell of the curry is so pleasant that it's a sin to not enjoy it twice. So, when considering the price of the entrees: remember that you're buying yourself lunch for the following day also.  5.) Most of the food items have wine suggestions next to them. I have no idea how helpful they are, but I will say that if you ask for an \"indian beer\" they will bring you something that is essentially malt liquor. That might not sound impressive, but the sweetness of it actually goes really well with many spicy dishes and is highly recommended.   Despite the fact that I feel that there is a \"correct\" way to order at the dhaba, and there's maybe ways to have a less satisfying experience, my rating is entirely for the helpfulness of the staff and the very high food quality.",

It begins right at the menu where the items are listed in a clever fashion with an intelligent play on words. The touch of an actual Rickshaw at the store entrance was quite interesting.  We had dishes from the tandoor including chicken, fish and lamb. Food was excellent and went even better with a bottle of wine. This establishment clearly has a terrific grasp on the tandoor oven and the accompanying and associated tastes and flavors.  The service on the other hand did not match the excellence of the prepared foods. Service was slow at times and we had to get the attention of the server a few times. Service needs a little bit of professionalism added to it.  We will go back to eat at this establishment again because the food was that great.",

We got garlic and jalepeno naan for the table, both excellent, and the owner is knowledgeable about his wines to pair with each entree.  The entree menu is extensive and a little overwhelming, but all 4 orders came out perfect. There was some overcooked tandoori chicken but that was immediately rectified without any protest. I would highly recommend a Dhaba Thali.  Just make sure you are humble when selecting the level of spiciness ;)",

The Lamb Korma is to die for and the Tikka Masala is awesome. The Kashmiri Naan is so good. I love this place.",

I was happy to find a Groupon to try it out and they were nice enough to let us use it on a carry-out order, once I explained our situation over the phone. For that accommodation, I added a star :) The location is in a rather \"scruffy\" side of town (not sure I'd want to hang out there after dark). When I arrived to pick up our food at 6pm, there was only one table occupied in the restaurant.   We ordered two chicken tikka masala dinners--one mild and one medium in spice level. However, both looked and tasted exactly the same...very bland. Each meal consisted of about 4-5 small pieces of chicken with a cup of basmati rice. We also split an order of garlic naan, which was good. Now, we've eaten at a few other Indian restaurants before, and never once have we been able to finish our meal in one sitting; we always have leftovers. But we were left still feeling hungry.   $35 for 2 dinners and an order of naan. Small portions, overpriced and not impressed.",

Our rose lassi was good, but small for the price ($4). The appetizers were all delicious although I don't remember any of the names.  The not so good- somewhat sullen service. We had trouble getting the waitress's attention several different times. She balked at splitting the check between two different parties even after we marked which dishes went onto each tab.  Most irritatingly, they tacked an 18% tip onto each tab even though we only had a party of 5 (4 adults, 1 child). I didn't see anything on the menu about the predetermined tip. Most places that do this only do it for parties over 6, 8 or 10 and it is almost always mentioned on the menu. This was really a major irritation after the mediocre service.",

But as we drove past it to our intended destination, I said \"look honey, that's Dhaba, it gets great reviews and has been written up in Phoenix Magazine.\"  The Main Man replied, \"its Indian, right? We like Indian, that naan bread, mmmmmm.\"  So we did what we went east to do and decided we had to give The Dhaba a go.  There was NO wait even though we had no reservation.  The hostess/waitress/manager was an absolutely gorgeous young woman who was very much into our learning experience and helped us sound out and pronounce our orders, lamb dishes for both of us.  We were given water and tea in a more than timely manner and the slight wait for our hand-made, fresh food was well worth it!  MM got the basmati rice and I opted, reluctantly as I steer clear of most carbs unless they are chocolate cake or cookies, for the brown rice.  Both were FABULOUS with the moist, tender lamb.  Both dishes of lamb were spicy without burning and the flavor was FINALLY noticeable... Most Indian food in the Valley honestly lacks heat, kick, and flavor... These dishes delivered in all three.  What I did not notice until it was time for the 'go' box is that the brown rice has the most elegant, aromatic scent.  I may not actually eat it, but I will go to the fridge a million times just to smell it!   All in all, we were lucky to grab up a table with no reservation, the food was awesome, the service pleasantly solid.  We are just sad The Dhaba is way across town...",

    "text": "Wanted to try authentic Indian food for a while and finally had the opportunity to check it out with some friends (the hubby is not as adventurous when it comes to food). I chose this place for the location and the yelp ratings and reviews.   I made 5pm reservations using open table which was simple and easy. When we showed up however, it took several minutes before we were greeted and shown our table. There were only two other tables occupied at the time so they were not busy at all. The host/server was nice though. The decor was tastefully done and the table settings and silver dishes gave the place a high class touch. It was also very clean.  For our first time, the menu was overwhelming. I've heard of a few dishes such as tikki masala and butter chicken. So we decided to order that plus two others that we weren't as familiar with.  I chose an appetizer that was described as a little bit of everything.  So I assumed it would be a platter type item so everyone could share, grab with their fingers and taste. When we received our appetizer it was not what I expected. Literally,  almost everything listed on the appetizer section was included in this dish covered with a yogurt type sauce sitting in a edible crispy shell. We asked how we were to go about eating it. The server told us to grab the spoon and break it off in pieces since each section held a different treat. So we did.  It was different but tasty. Would I order it again?  Probably not.  Our main dish was very spicy but that was to be expected. I had just enough rice to curry ratio to finish my meal. But my favorite part of the meal was the garlic naan. I loved it! I'd eat that all day. Also, if you check in through yelp you receive a free house dessert which was a rice pudding. I'm usually not a fan of rice puddings but it really helped balance out all the spices I just ate. So I basically gobbled that up.  The reason I'm only giving 3 stars was because we were not able to use our Groupon. After reading other yelp reviews, I noticed many referring to the special on Groupon which was to purchase $16 for $30 worth of food.  I bought the Groupon today to use today. But the server told us we were not able to use it because we have to wait 24 hours before use otherwise the system would not accept it. Then she said to come back and use it at a later time. There was nothing specific in the fine print about not being able to use in the same day.  Well I will not be back and hopefully I will be able to get a refund from Groupon.   Overall, the food was okay. It's just not my preference. But I plan on trying other places closer to where I live.  Maybe I just have to find the right dish.",

They reluctantly took us and 2 other tables that arrived shortly after us. We waited about 10-15min.  to be served. It was only annoying because those other 2 tables had their orders taken before we had drink order taken. Once we ordered food was out promptly, under 15 min.  We loved the complimentary cracker/bread with sauces to start. Dhaba Chicken Korma & Tandori Tikke chicken were fantastic and worth the wait. Portions aren't huge but we still had leftovers.

    "text": "Simply walking in provided me with a promising feeling. This was going to be real authentic Indian cuisine; that I had no doubt about. The air was filled with wafts of spices and herbs that were absolutely mouth-watering. The atmosphere screamed Indian culture and I almost believed I had left the country and entered into India itself. Along with the restaurant there was a quaint little Indian market right next door that was extremely time consuming while they prepared a table for your meal. It was filled with all sorts of Indian delicacies along with Indian clothing and decor. It most definitely added to the authentic Indian experience.        Once we were seated, we were greeted by an exceptionally friendly waiter who seemed genuinely concerned that we had a pleasurable time. It was clear that his ultimate goal was to make sure we had what we needed when we needed it. It was almost as if he was a mind reader and knew exactly when we needed something. This is one thing that can make or break the dining experience and they nailed it right on the head. The service alone would make me return to The Dhaba.       Finally for the crucial component of any restaurant, the food. Just as everything else I was blown out of the water after taking the first bite of my Murgh Seekh Kabab. It was beyond divine, so much so, I couldn't find the will to put my fork down. The flavors bursted every which way in my mouth; the dhaba spices and herbs which the chicken was marinated in took life. I will have to admit I was a little skeptical before coming to try this food but I must say I am well pleased with everything. The Dhaba is something I would recommend to anyone that is curious to try authentic Indian cuisine.",

Every time we have been there our experience has been wonderful.   I will add one note, I am hoping this was just a fluke, but the last time we were in the owners were not there and the young Indian girl working there had on club music so loud I could not here my husband speak. At first I thought ok they just opened maybe they'll turn it off. Nope it played loudly the whole time. Also the bus girl and the Indian girl just disappeared we needed water and there was no one around, we waited 15 minutes plus for someone to get us our check, we actually had to stop the girl to ask for the check because she just kept walking by.  With this being said, we still love the Dhaba, and will continue visiting often. However if this ever happens again we might have to consider finding another place to get our Indian food.",

Given it was just two of us in town, I couldn't be bothered to cook a big traditional meal - this was one of the most memorable Christmas meals we've had!  My husband was immediately excited when we pulled up and noticed they have a store attached to the restaurant advertising British food (he's from Scotland).  So in addition to a delicious meal we were able to purchase Cadbury Flakes for dessert. The meal itself was unexpectedly good. We started out with an order of onion bhaji and a dish I don't remember the name of (aloo tikki chaat perhaps?), but it resembled a deconstructed samosa -- AMAZING!  We knew we wanted to try the Lamb Vindaloo and the waitress recommended we also go with the Chicken Tikka Masala. We asked the dishes be prepared based on the chefs recommended spice level. I was shocked by how much my husband enjoyed the tikka masala - not usually his favorite as he doesn't like anything sweet. The dish had the perfect amount of spice and creaminess. I also really enjoyed the lamb vindaloo, the flavors continued to build as the meal went on - and was really good for breakfast the next day.  The service was excellent. We found everyone to be very personable and able to provide great recommendations with some funny stories to tell. We sat near the hostess stand and I noticed that many people with 7pm reservations arrived early. The hostess handled the groups early arrival well, especially given there were two people serving all of the tables.   The menu is unique, offering much for vegetarians and carnivores alike. I wasn't feeling well and was happy sipping on my Chai tea (so yummy). We will definitely be back to enjoy another meal soon!",

    "text": "I was so glad I actually had time to try this authentic Punjabi Indian restaurant located on Apache Boulevard. Outside, they have a number of rickshaws which make excellent photo ops, as well as a Tandoori oven. Inside, you will be pleasantly surprised to find a small, quaint restaurant with about a dozen tables. It definitely has that mom-and-pop type of feel. The menu is expansive, had wine pairings in the margins, and their spice scale is from 1 to 10. We started off the meal with mango lassi (really creamy and refreshing) and complementary papadum. Instead of the usual brown tamarind or green cilantro chutney, they actually have a third chutney that will make you sweat and clear your sinuses with about two bites.  We decided to order two meat dishes and two veggie dishes, one of each would be super spicy and the rest would be mild so the whole family including the kids could enjoy. We ordered: chicken korma, tava sabji, lamb curry, palik kofta, a spiced veggie dish, and two types of Naan. Basmati rice was included. All the food was wonderfully spiced and well balanced. Our two spicy dishes, which we had requested a seven, was too mild. The chicken and lamb were extremely tender and broken apart with your fork.   Speaking of forks, each place setting must've cost $100. All of the plates, utensils, and cups were handmade copper imported from India. The drinking cup would have made a fine Moscow Mule cup.  For dessert we received our free complementary house desert by checking in on yelp, as well as the ras malai. Both were fantastic and did not overdo the cardamom.   Service did feel rushed. Naturally, the place is small, so they want to turn the tables over quickly. They need to take a chill pill.   Additionally, another huge negative is that they are located next to a gas station were a lot of undesirables were hanging out. I went to check in my car twice just to make sure it was not broken into.   I definitely can't wait to come back and try more items from the expansive menu",

Restaurants can have bad days and after visiting Dhaba on multiple occasions since my last review, I'm convinced I caught them on an \"off night\". food and service in our subsequent visits has brought as back to Dhaba as regular customers and we would recommend this Indian restaurant to anyone looking for a place to call their favorite!  The past several times we've been here, the food has been great and the staff is friendly and helpful.  We love the papadum with the trio of chutneys that are served complimentary while deciding what to order.  The korma is wonderful as are the tandoori and vegetarian dishes we've had.  The Indian spices are spot on and the naan is so good that we always need another order.   We like our food spicy, but for those of you who like a more mild dish, Dhaba will customize your order to please.  Dhaba has become our favorite Indian restaurant in the valley and we dine her regularly.",

A word of warning to those of you who think you like spice: this food is very spicy!  I asked the server to bring down the heat level to 50% and my nose was still dripping, but that didn't take away from the phenomenal taste of the food. I recommend to those of you who are looking for a tasty meal, go to The Dhaba!",

    "text": "I've been here a few times and always enjoy each visit. First of all, when you walk in you get an inviting feeling from the smiles  and courteousness of the staff. You get to experience a bit of the culture with the lovely dining set they have and by the look of the decor. And of course, the many flavorful dishes that they offer! Their staff pays attention to the water level of your cup and ensures it is filled. That's an A+ :)  This time around I tried papadum which is a  starter. It looks like a tortilla but the texture is a light tortilla chip made of lentil powder, rice powder and some different spices. You can practically eat these non-stop!   Favorites/Chicken/Tandoors/Bread/Dessert: - Rahon dal tarka which is yellow lentils mixed with different herbs and spices. You can eat this with their saffron cumin rice.  - Gudaspuri Mutter Paneer which is blended mix of peas and cheese along with the dhaba herbs and spices. Great for trying to fulfill the veggie part of your daily food intake! ;) palak paneer (spinach and cheese) is also good.  - Gazab Ka Kadahi Murgh which is a BBQ boneless chicken marinated in a spicy yogurt. This is my new favorite dish because it's baked in their clay oven. Once cooked then its marinated in the yogurt sauce and mixed with onions, bell peppers and tomato to create a wonderful sauce.  - Tandoori Murgh (chicken) cooked in the clay oven paired with onions and a squeeze of lemon.  - Pani Puri which is small finger foods. \"Street food\"  Little chip-like texture cups filled with potatoes and chick peas. Pour the mint water in the filled cups and add an optional taramind sauce or mint sauce.  - Garlic Naan is hands down my favorite garlic naan I have tasted!! If you're wanting garlic naan then come here to eat it. It's soft  ,airy, fluffy with the right amount of crispness on the edges and amount of garlic shavings on top!  - Ras Malai (sweet condensed milk cheese circular chunks) homemade dessert. Think of fresh mozzarella cheese texture. Really soft clean texture mixed in with the condensed milk cream sauce.  - Halwa which is a Carrot fudge (sweet cooked carrot shavings boiled in condensed milk mixed with hints of pistachios, cashews, and golden raisins. Really innovative for a homemade dessert!   Overall I loved this place because I can always select new dishes as well as favorite dishes to eat and I can always expect great friendly service from their staff. Gotta come check this place out! Mmm mmm gooddd! Only thing I regret was not taking pics of the delicious foods!! Next time. ;)",

The fried onion treats were exceptional.  The chicken tikka masala was also very good.    Unfortunately the lamb boti kabab was very disappointing.  It was so dry and tasteless, no joke it was like boot leather.  I even asked the waitress if it was supposed to be that dry and she said, \"everything here is well done,\" but quite honestly that was a disgrace.  Lamb should be moist and delicious this was like steak that you get at Denny's at 2:30am.  As a side note there gulab jamun was breath taking.  I'm not a desert guy but I would suggest this to anyone try.  The Dhaba is on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.restaurant.com%2F&s=c4ef09f1858d401c76bd9a419f78cd60dfbbf811f57deeb0c97edbdb5f933789\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> so you can get a great discount and I would give the green light to try it just don't order the lamb.",

However, after a few minutes, I decided I would be prepared to wait and enjoy a nice, slow evening and meal, and remember to make reservations for future visits.       Once seated, it did take some time to get the order in, but it was well worth the wait. The Masala Chai tea was spiced to perfection, fragrant, and with some added honey, it was the perfect beverage. I had the vegetarian \"meat\"balls (I can't recall the Indian name) which were satisfying and savory and did not disappoint. Everything came out piping hot and fresh. I will most definitely be a returning patron.",

Because he has located his restaurant in the midst of his other Indian oriented stores, it has a feeling of attractive authenticity.  The husband is from the Punjab and the wife is from Hong Kong.  They make a marvelous and delightful team.  The food is the real star here.  The Papardams with delicious sauces were the starter.  Then we had their chick pea dish which was so light and flavorful.  Everything was obviously fresh.  I then had the chicken biryani and my wife had a mixed vegetable dish and both were exquisite.  The naan bread was delicious as well.  I have nothing negative to write.   We will become regulars as we have been looking for a good Indian restaurant without any luck in the Scottsdale area.  Try the Shiraz red wine from India.  It goes so well with the spicy food.",

We had the garlic naan, lamb soup, chicken mango curry, chicken and lamb curry. The basmati rice and garlic naan were out if this world, the meats were all tender and tasty. We also had chai tea and rice pudding and they were pretty good! The only down side is that the service was a little slow but we will definitely come back, the portions are very good and filling! :)",

I had two friends that had never tried indian food before so I took them here and they were in shock haha. Definiately a great place to go.

    "text": "I have frequented this restaurant since it opened. I understand the problems people may have with the place, i have had a few of my own.   There are also the great things which people have mentioned. Here are some more....   There is this new guy in charge there, from Sri Lanka, who is really cool (and into Pink Floyd). I think he's changed a few things recently, and also is a very helpful energetic server. Each day, there is now a different salad for lunch. Our lunch thali began with an outstanding salad with mangoes, lettuce, and veggies served in a bowl shaped papad! Later that lunch, when he found out my friend did not eat dairy, he offered an awesome fruit salad for desert instead of the gulab jamen in creamy fruit sauce.   Another time, we were talking to our waiter about one of the dishes, a bitter melon dish (the melon with the spikey outside). We decided to stick to our normal orders. Then, the guy brings out the dish for our group of three to try on the house! I would not recommend ordering the dish here, it is funky and bitter. At the end of the meal, they brought out hot towels and lemon for us to clean up with. They were pampering us, maybe because we come in all the time and tip well.   I later had the bitter melon in New Delhi and it was way better. I'm thinking the melon might be shipped here, giving it a strange taste. This is most certainly the case with the Indian soda, Limca, which you can order. I believe they ship over old batches, as evidenced by the lower cost printed on the bottle, and the aftertaste of cardboard. I want a real limca so bad. Its nice that they have chaat (indian street food), but it was better before I knew what Indian street food really tastes like. Still, it's these things which makes Dhaba stand out above the other places, that and its cool to hang out there.   It also can be slightly cheaper than Delhi palace, or royal taj.",

    "text": "Tonight was my third time going to this place. Not sure if we'll ever go back.  The first time I loved it--it was lunch time on a week day, meaning it was basically empty and the service was great. Being my first time eating Indian food, I had a lot of questions about the menu, and the waitress was very helpful. I ordered the full meal experience and it was fantastic, especially for the price ($14 or so).   The next experience we had was a few months later and we realized just how expensive the food was. It is crazy that everything is sold separately, only a few dishes are even served with rice. I mean, who wants to eat a bowl of chicken curry with no sides? For a table of four, I think our bill was around $80 and that was with us sharing!  Despite the high prices, we went again tonight. We had reservations and were promptly seated, but they only have ONE waitress on a Saturday night. Crazy!  We asked for some appetizers and one of the guys said we'd have to wait for the waitress. She came to our table a few minutes later and we decided to order everything because we figured it would be a while before she'd come back. The food came out quickly, but the samosas we ordered were raw in a few parts and also cold in the middle. Gross! (We didn't complain because no one checked on us and the waitress was up at the front of the restaurant helping the rest of her customers).  The rest of the food was served pretty quick and we enjoyed the rest of our meal.  By far the worst thing about tonight was that after we were finished eating (we waited quite some time for our check) I started to look around and noticed a THICK layer of dust covering the frames and mirrors on the wall, which were hung right above my head. I also noticed there was chunks of dust stuck to the wall. Seriously, that was enough to make me question the cleanliness of everything else. Yuck!",

No, I wouldn't go for a midnight stroll around there, but for lunch, it's safe. One of the reviewers said, \"Great for Americans\"...

I really was expecting more for the money than what I got. Also, I am a fan of spicy foods and really hate it when ethnic restaurants mild down their spiciness levels when serving to American eaters (call it a pet peeve of mine). Each time I ordered here they of course asked me how spicy I wanted my meal (1-10 stars) and I told them \"10 stars, extra, extra spicy please!\" However, what ended up on my plate was maybe about 3 stars... very mild compared to what I like and what I was expecting. That left me very disappointed so after my third attempt, I decided that this would in fact NOT become a regular ethnic eating place for me. The flavors are good, but the heat is missing.",

The chicken is usually over done & not the best cuts of meat, but because the sauces are so vibrant, it's easy to hide from some.  Rice & Naan are separate, which is disappointing.  The atmosphere is nice & not tacky like many other indian restaurants.",

Of the \"traditional\" indian drink selection; they were completely out of all the drinks. I asked for my curry \"hot, really hot and spicy.\" It was not. We had a group of 5 and half of our table had to wait for silverware after their food arrive. Then it took them about 35 minutes to bring us our check, nor did we get any water refills, all night. It was a bad time all round.",

    "text": "Before beginning with my review, I would like to critic (!!) on something that I read through a lot of reviews here for \"The\" Dhaba...  \" There is no f* variable Spice level in Indian food... \" I get enraged when people say these things as if these are the conventions for food... Most of the Indian recipes ( 99% at least ) are prepared with a predetermined spice level... \" How do you want your food, mild medium or spicy ? \" is the dumbest thing I have come across in my entire restaurant life... there are some recipes that are supposed to be SPICY and some are supposed to be Medium and some Sweet... reason being Indian spices range way more than just Chilly for heaven's sake... Thai restaurants vary Spice level just by adding more Chili... Indian spices are way more than just chili and you can not add / subtract spices like Chili sauce since spices are added during the process of cooking and not on top as garnishing...   In short, \"Mild, Medium or Spicy\" is like asking what kind of a football player do you want for your team \" fast, faster or fastest \" .. well, quarterback position needs a fast player, tight ends could be faster but wide receivers need to be the fastest... but you can not f* switch and play the game !  All right... about the restaurant... my opinion is that if you wish to have real Indian food, you have to go to cities other than Phoenix (or even better, go to India... !)... I have been to some Indian restaurants in Houston, Washington DC, New York, San Diego, New Jersey and a few more places and all places have much better Indian restaurants than in our Valley... but if it comes to sticking to the choices we have around, I would rank \"The\" Dhaba as the most \"close to actual\" Indian food that you have get...  Jewel of the crown ranks probably the second... but overall, all Indian restaurants around here are good for some particular things on the Menu and worse for others...  Dhaba comes to being better for almost everything on the menu... Chicken tikka masala (butter chicken) related dishes are very good, all lamb dishes are nice and authenticated... vegetarian options are awfully limited compared to what it should be considering its an Indian restaurant... ( common restaurants in India have at least 40 more vegetarian items on their menu, no kidding !)  But overall I am very pleased with the range of quality here at The Dhaba.. garlic Naan's are way too good to resist... tea (complimentary) is very close to what people in India drink... almost all non-vegetarian dishes and paneer tikka masala or mixed vegetables are tasty... (somebody wrote about salads and I would like to remind that salads are not Indian because other green vegetables are very common in regular diets)...  and yeah... if you like Indian music, they have live music these days on the weekends, I guess... and though I have never been there for the music, I bet that would be cool....",

Several lunch specials that include salad, soup, rice, entree, and naan were priced reasonably.  Service was pleasant.  Food was middle of the road.  Soup size was a little small. Naan was dense, thin, and chewy.  Not bad overall, but could be better.  Owner contacted me regarding my experience and I have good assurance it will be better next time, and I'll certainly return.  Great to see proprietors that truly care.",

    "text": "Use to be our favorite Indian restaurant, driving out of our way just to dine there . We came on a Sunday at 7:00 p.m., last day of \"Restaurant Week in PHX\" to take advantage of the $40 special. We were greeted and seated right away from a young lady who was the Hostess, Order taker and Drink server.   The young lady finally got around to our table after waiting a bit to take out drink order and menu order. We decided to go with the Restaurant Week PHX $40 which changed when we got there to $44 special. We ordered our whole meal up front 1st. course: Bombay Bhel Puri (crisp puffed rice, onions, potatoes, cilantro), 2nd. course: 2 Kashmiri Chicken Tikka Masala (level of hotness a 6 and an 8), 3rd. course: Kulfi (ice cream made with pistachios, cardamom seeds).  I can honestly say we were very disappointed overall, the wait to take our order was long and the wait to get our drinks (beers) was long. What was not a long wait was to give us our bill which I noted on the Web site for Restaurant week we were to be charged only $40 not $44. The 1st. course we ordered was OK I just think it was personal taste. The 2nd. course which we've had many times had very little chicken, the spice levels we requested were tame (again we frequent here quit a bit, so we know). The Naan was chewy and doughy. To top it off, our dessert was delivered and we were told they ran out so they gave a mango ice cream that I did NOT like, but mean while 2 tables down got the pistachio Ice cream (they arrive well after we did). We were told by the young lady \"well they just pick it out of a container and you get what you get\".  Really? I took note that the young lady was not very friendly, an abrupt manner to everyone, workers and diners. What happen? when the Mother and Father Owners were there the service ran much smoother, food was excellent even for the $$. The food which I raved about was not good, the Naan was horrible and the dessert mess up and at $44 there frankly was no savings cost.  Sorry service OK, wait bad, food OK and for the $ price this is the last time.",

They act like this is some gourmet experience with having to use Open Table. Every order was off with the heat level and a cook with a heavy hand with salt. The Chicken Biryani was tasteless, I would have thought this would be a dish they would have been good at. We ordered Chicken Kabobs as an appetizer again very tasteless. My Chicken paneer was below average on flavor. My son's Paneer Tikka Masala he said was average. He eats Indian food at least once a week. My wife's dinner she ordered was to be a 3 on the heat level. Well it was as hot as mine and I had an 8. That got sent back. And by the time her new dinner was done she got that to go because we were done eating our dinner. She never got the Chai or the desert that was included with her meal. I feel there are  a lot better choices than this place. They are not cheap by any means, for the 3 of us with out any drinks it was $98.00 plus $20.00 tip. To me this was not worth it and I have had better food at Indian Oven for half of the cost.Our waiter was good and someone should tell the women walking around it does not hurt to smile pretend you like your job.",

    "text": "Wow! This has to be the best Indian food we have had in the Phoenix-area for some time. We do not like very spicy food so we were hesitant (have ordered things mild or 1 at other places and still had it be really super hot). However, everything we ordered was spiced just exactly as we like it! The food was all so flavorful and everything seemed very fresh. The meat was of good quality and without gristle or fat. The only downside was the online ordering wasn't working. :( Hopefully they fix it because we want to order from here again!",

I ordered the lamb and it was tasty and didn't have the smell that most other Indian restaurants have I. Their lamb dishes. The sauce and garlic naan was delicious. My wife had the chicken tikka masala and that was great as well. To top off the meal was a clean rice pudding that refreshed the palate. Highly recommended.",

Since I and my family are a big fan of appetizers,  we tried all kinds that were available there with naan and they were all simple amazing (Lehsuni kebab, chicken tikka,  fish tikka,  panner tikka etc) The service was very good and accurate. We were a big group of people ( around 10),  the hostess took order with ease and there was no mix up in food. Servers served food with a smile,  which made food even more appetizing :)   Mango lassi is a must. I would definitely come to this place again to satisfy my Indian food cravings :)",

I would imagine that it might get busy on a Friday or Saturday night and require reservations though, because the place is not huge. Not small either, but very cosy.  We both ordered the \"whole meal\" thalis. My boyfriend had the maharaja (all meat) and I had the combo with dal, chick peas, and chicken curry. The biryani that came with the food was the best I have ever had. I would go there just to eat the biryani alone. The naan was top notch too. Everything was delicious. I was really surprised for Arizona.  The thalis also come with chai and desert. They were very accomodating when I forgot that chai is brewed with whole milk (I'm lactose intolerant) and they traded mine out for a delicious dark tea.  The service was a little slow, but still great. The restaurant was almost full while we were there but it was never too noisy. The modern Indian music was a nice touch too.",

    "text": "We came here over the weekend after my husband had a craving for Indian food and found The Dhaba online and said it had the best reviews he had seen for Indian food near us. We drove out from Gilbert and found the restaurant easily.   Upon entering the restaurant, we saw they had about 15 tables, and about 3 of them had guests. A few had \"reserved\" signs on them. The woman at the front (I believe she and her husband are the owners, she also took our order) asked immediately if we had a reservation, and we did not. She made it seem like it would be very difficult to get us a table, despite the relative emptiness of the restaurant when we arrived. A minute or two later we were able to be seated.   The place settings were impressive with the heavy brass cups and brass-accented silverware. We ordered our favorites (garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo), and the food came out very fast. I have a low spicy tolerance and ordered my food at a \"2\" and it seemed more like what I would call a \"5\" - I would have loved a larger water cup while I was eating, but man was it delicious (though no one should ask me to be a spice judge!). I thought the cart they used to bring the food out was a little weird, and with the napkins clipped on to it, it seemed very unimpressive in a very otherwise impressive setting. Some of the staff could be friendlier, but that didn't take away from the food, and I even brought my leftover sauce home and cooked more chicken (and added some plain yogurt to temper the spice for this weakling) for leftovers! We will be back (we both like quality Indian food, and The Dhaba certainly delivered!), but we'll be sure to make a reservation next time. :)",

    "text": "We had some friends coming over from RI who were craving for authentic Indian cuisine and so based on the yelp reviews we took them to the Dhaba! And we were not disappointed. The ambiance is very acceptable. They've managed to recreate a mildly Indian atmosphere in there. We went along with our vegetarian friends and stuck to a veggie diet. The bhel puri wasn't that great, however the samosa chat more than made up for it. The garlic naan as many of the other reviews point out, was simply surreal. The same could be said of the paneer tikka masala and the kofta. The food was really good.  Now, for the put offs:  1. With just one other table occupied in the restaurant and us having given our orders in advance, it took 20 good minutes for the food to arrive. And that too, after the other table was served.  2. The lovely young lady who welcomed us, showed us our seats and took our orders had a terrible scowl writ all over her face. She never once did smile, was very curt and generally had the air of someone who was waiting on a bunch of people who had invaded her house, uninvited. Despite the food and the ambiance and the wait time, the one thing which we all kept going back to weeks after our visit to the Dhaba, was how dispirited and unwelcoming the lady was.  Bottom line verdict: Good food, Good ambiance, Not really welcoming.",

The naan here is delicious, and one order could feed four to five people.   I have ordered the Dal Makhani, Punjabi Chole, Dil Bahar Korma, and Sialkoti Rajmeh, and all of these had delicious flavors and spice.  You can determine the level of spice, like most Indian restaurants.   The entries come with white or brown rice.   The only complaint I have is that it can take a while even after seated.  Both times I have gone for dine-in, it was fairly crowded, but it was at least 20 minutes before someone even came by to ask for our orders.  However, due to the extensive menu, this wasn't a problem, since there are many delicious items in which to choose, we needed that time!  Water refills are constant and the food comes out quite quick after ordered.   *edited because they changed hours.  Not open till 10 pm anymore.",

I stick to the vegetarian dishes and have yet to be disappointed.  The staff is always friendly, the restaurant clean and the music fun.  Once in a while there will be videos playing on the flat screen above the bar, but normally just some good music.  I will update this review after eating there this weekend!",

The service was a little slow at times, but the overall atmosphere was friendly and inviting.  The food came out hot and was flavorful, with a hint of spice, and delicious.  Both the plain and garlic naan were crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside, the perfect combination.  There is also a small, but decent, selection of Indian beer.  And though the food came out in what appeared to be somewhat small dishes, we had enough leftovers to take home and make another meal.",

Usually papads are offered as complimentary in most of the Indian restaurants around the world. However they served in pappad after i seated and later chared me for it saying your check was not above a certain limit.... This is the most ridiculous thing i ever heard....

While that was good, this was awe-inspiring.  The Dhaba is NOT a buffet restaurant. They serve fresh Punjabi food and have an extensive menu. But not at lunch during the week. Their innovative approach is to rotate through the best items on their menu each week. We ate their on a Thursday. We skipped the two vegetarian entrees and went straight for the chicken and lamb. Both were melt-in-your-mouth outstanding. Both were spiced for flavor, not simply heat. I'm a huge fan of hot food, but it wasn't until driving out of the parking lot that I realized how not-hot the food had been. Amazing.  We had the Mur Lasuni Tikka (chicken) and the Kali Marichi Ka Gosht (lamb). Served family style, with fantastic madras lentils (they probably call it something different), yogurt sauce (taziki?) , naan that perfectly complimented the meal instead of overpowering it, and a lovely salad with a mango-and-lots-of-other-good-stuff dressing.  The lovely lady there took the time to explain everything to us and made the experience that much better. And since they rotate the lunch menu every day during the week -- full menu on the weekends and for dinner -- I have good reason to return at least four more times this month!",

I usually get their Vindaloo, although I've had the Dhaba curry, and a couple others (both lamb and chicken).  The Naan is great, and we've been given a couple desserts on the house that were fun and interesting.  They do a good job of trying to find some stuff for our kids to eat, but we usually just bring something along for them to have with basmati rice.  My wife gets their Chiken Tikka Masala, and she loves it.  We often go here for lunch, which is not a buffet (which we prefer).",

    "text": "At 1pm on a Wednesday we were the only customers.  Service was friendly, but slow. The 2 servers/manager were too busy chatting on the phone in the back or eating their own lunch.  Another group departing as we came in seemed to be waiting at the front counter for about 10 minutes for the girl in the office to finish her phone call and close their tab.    Food was good, reasonably priced for a lunch combo with more than enough food.  3 of us ordered the lunch special (2 vegetarian, 1 chicken) which were all good, although the heat level was off.  The 2 vegetarians asked for heat level 3 (offered range of 1-10) while the chicken was requested as a 9.  Both came out around a 5. Why bother asking if you're not going to follow through.  Portions were good but oddly served.  Lunch combo includes salad, chutneys, rice, naan, entree, side, and desert.   For our group of 3 we were served 2 bowls of rice and 2 pieces of naan. We didn't run out, so it was ok, but seemed odd when everything else was served in individual dishes.  We had to ask for the salad and chutneys which were forgotten.  Masala Chai tea (which to me is the barometer of quality for any restaurant) was just ok. Too much fennel/anise flavor, and too thick/heavy being made with a lot of whole milk.    I checked in on yelp (which is how I found the place, after my first choice and favorite Udupi turned out to be closed/out of business!).  Yelp specified it was open for lunch, and offered a $15 for $25 coupon, which I purchased.  It wasn't until the end of the meal and attempting to pay that I was rudely told the promo wasn't valid with the lunch special.  I told her that wasn't mentioned in the terms, she made some excuse and wandered off.   I decided I'd just take it up with Yelp later, and put my card in the folio.  Unfortunately she disappeared and after about 10 minutes of waiting I tracked her down in the office behind the hostess stand, knocking on the door and interrupting her personal phone call.  At that point I was getting upset. with the service and called her out on the yelp promo, insisting that the only restrictions are that it's not valid for takeout or on Fridays/Saturdays. She disagreed but finally said she'd honor it and wrote down the promo code and adjusted my bill.  Overall the food was good but service was unacceptable. Portions and prices if ordering the lunch combo were reasonable but ala-carte and dinner menu pricing were excessive and the portions are probably the same judging by other reviews.  I would not return given the variety of other Indian options in the area.",

It all started as soon as we entered the place. I had reservations then also she made me wait for half an hour and another 15-20 min for them to take the order. The food was a lot below our expecations and on top in the middle of our dinner the asian lady asks us for groupon. I showed her it over the phone and then she asked me to show the redeem button so that she can press it. For some reason the site didnt showed us the redemmed button so i asked her to take the coupon id, i think thats all they need , but she kept on insisting. Finally i literally have to shout at her to leave us alone till we are done with dinner.  It was one hell of a expereince , please stay away from the dhaba.

I know that seems odd, but I'm so used to walking into a new Indian restaurant and being a bit irritated by the cheesy decor.    Anyhow, this place is just an alright Indian restaurant.  I ordered my standard chicken tikka masala and enjoyed it.  The spiciness wasn't where I wanted it to be, but I'm used to that.  It wasn't amazing, but it also wasn't bad.  Just okay.  Pierre puts it well in his review- \"the tastiness of the food is good but unspectacular by Indian restaurant standards.\"  Our service was average.  The man working seemed to want to help us out, but forgot things on a few occasions throughout the meal.    With the convenience of a being right near a light rail stop, I'd most definitely stop here again if I were craving Indian and in Tempe, but I don't believe I'd go out of my way to come back here.  Just another okay Indian place in PHX.",

    "text": "I'm giving the Dhaba 4 stars, after much thought.   The negatives: the tastinesss of the food is good but unspectacular by Indian restaurant standards. Similarly, the service was also satisfactory, though our non-Indian waiter had kind of an odd personality. Nothing that affected our service I guess, but my friends and I discretely exchanged looks of bewilderment more than once during dinner. On service and food alone, I would give the Dhaba an average or slightly above-average 3 stars.   What brings it over the edge to 4 stars are the little things. Where else in Arizona can someone like one of the friends I was with, a white dude from a small town in rural Utah, have his first taste of a Thums Up or Limca!? Seeing those old-school Indian soda offerings on the menu blew me away. (It also featured Fanta, also popular in India back in the day but with an equally nostalgic effect on my white-bread American friends). The traditional cots in the patio seating area outside (useless trivia: \"cot\" is a Hindi word borrowed by the English), the stainless steel glasses used to serve water and other authentic Indian-dhaba details had a similar effect on me. I was both impressed and swept up by the nostalgia.   Another plus factor is the extensive and creative menu selection. For the unacquainted, I recommend you try as an appetizer one of the \"chaats\", especially the tiki chaat, with a caveat about their high spiciness levels. If you're a culinary adventurer, there are plenty of other things to experiment with. I've always considered one of the bonuses of experimenting with Indian food to be that there are always dozens of vegetarian selections, so the risk of eating something truly nasty without knowing it really is minimal.   I will confess, this business started on the wrong foot with me. I still suspect it engaged in some dubious Yelp marketing practices, early on. And the very name, Dhaba, is also a bit presumptuous in my book. A dhaba is a highway truck stop you will find everywhere throughout northern India and Pakistan. Within these dhabas is the best Indian food you will ever taste in your life anywhere in the world, period. Eating at Tempe's Dhaba is not, I'm afraid, the same thing as eating at a dhaba. Despite all that, their effort at adding some funny and curious details to the dining experience for those who are familiar with India is enough to win my grumpy self over.   Conveniently located within a 2-3 minute stroll from the Apache-McClintock light rail stop.",

It was white meat which I prefer, many Indian restaurants put the word boneless on the menu which leads me to believe chicken breast but it is usually dark meat, off the bone. The Dhaba didn't do that and actually did white meat for chicken tikka which is authentic. The chicken was juicy but needed more flavor. The second time I came here we ordered the chicken achari, malai kofta and garlic naan. The achari was tasty, but I wish the spices were not so coarse, still not bad! The koftas in the malai kofta were good but the gravy had too much jeera (cumin) for me personally, although my fiance liked it. The naan could have been fresher. The third time we ordered their tandoori sampler platter and it was ok, the chicken tikka was my favorite, my fiance liked the murgh seekh kebabs but the tandoori chicken and tandoori prawns weren't very flavorful and needed more spice. The staff aren't terribly friendly either, and the prices are a little high for the food.",

We went here tonight with a deal chicken deal that was like 44$ for 92$ worth of food that included: four beers/glasses of wine, two apps, two mains, two sides, two desserts, and two chai teas. Well... the place was overrun by a table of about 20... so the service was slow and they ran out of chai, only having enough to give us like half of one glass. Also, they only brought us each one drink.... so I felt like that was kind of lame, especially considering we had to pay tax and 18% tip on '92$' worth of food, when we really got maybe 65$ worth of food.... pretty lame.   Other than that, the place was good. We got the fried paneer, which I actually wasn't a huge fan of... kind of bland, but then I've never had paneer, so that may just be what it tastes like. The app with the fluffy bread and chickpea curry was really good. The bread was almost like a savory donut or something.... yum. For mains we got chicken tikka masala and  lamb korma. I usually love the CTM, but I think the pieces of chicken were too big, which made them kind of dry and not as flavorful as it could be. The lamb korma, however, was wonderful! The meat was super tender and the curry was great. They also had good basmati rice and garlic naan. For dessert I got their 'ice cream' which is more ice -y than creamy... almost like frozen rice or something... but it was very good. The BF got the rice pudding and enjoyed it. We also enjoyed the chai (what we got of it anyway....). So I would probably return and eat way less food.... but maybe I'll be more picky when it comes to using deals at this place, as it didn't really turn out to be a deal at all.",

    "text": "The Dhaba was a real treat!  I went on a weekday evening about 8:30pm and was surprised how busy it was.  First good sign. The two of us were immediately seated and served chilled water in the most interesting copper goblets.  A selction of chutney and papadum came right away as well.  The Hostess was also our server, She took our beverage order while we began a strategy of what to order.  The menu was very extensive and contained many items I had never heard of before. Despite the wide array of choices we stayed pretty basic, choosing a paneer masala, chicken tikka, a savory chick pea dish and of course basmati rice and naan.   The meal came quickly and was the freshest I think I have ever had.  Every bite was phenomenal. From the Service to the dishes and everything in between made this experience truly memorable.  I cannot wait to go back!!  The only thing I would change- Now I am being hyper critical, would be the lighting.  It was very bright for an evening meal.  I guess it made me appreciate the appearance of the food easier.",

    "text": "Wow!  My wife and I have been going all around Scottsdale & Tempe sampling different Indian food, and The Dhaba is our new favorite!  The onion pakora were seasoned and spiced perfectly. Lamb kofta was great, the meat was super tender.  We ordered \"medium\" spice level, but it seemed pretty mild to us.  Spice level is all relative of course, just sayin'.  It's a pretty small place, we didn't have reservations (Saturday night at 8pm-ish) and waited about 20 minutes.  Not bad at all, but it was just 2 of   us, so if you have larger party be sure and call ahead.  Food service was quick.",

    "text": "I have never had Indian food until I visited The Dhaba. The moment I walked in, there was an overwhelming smell of spice. My husband thought it was great. I struggled to breathe. It wasn't a bad smell, it was REALLY strong. I recovered from my asthma attack and was able to take in the whole atmosphere. There was a guy in the corner playing music quietly, and only a few tables in the whole place. We had a reservation, but they were unaware of needing to have a high chair ready so, we had to wait a couple minutes. No big deal. We listened to the guy in the corner and made faces at each other to pass the time with a three year old. While we waited a couple walked in for a table. They were told that without a reservation it would be more than a 30 minute wait. They left. We didnt. We were directed to our table covered with shiny silver tableware except one thing: A plastic cup with Mickey Mouse, specifically for my son to use during his visit (he happens to like the mouse ). We were left to figure out the extensive menu without a clue to start with. And even right after it was ordered, I couldn't tell you what it was. There was vegetarian rice and chicken and lamb. All of it was very flavorful and very spicy! We were asked to rate the heat we wanted. I learned the hard way, 5 is still pretty hot and it is WAY different than Mexican food spice! The food was remarkable. The service is just meh. The price was also what I would consider average. My son only ate the flat bread (naan?), he didn't want to try anything else, but for the three of us it was only around $40. I was so full leaving there with good food sitting in my belly. We will probably go back another time.",

There were no flavours the texture was weird and on top it was overly cooked the chicken tikka and tandori was like rubber the seek kebab was bland with no spices or any taste and on top the shrimps looked liked they were only coloured and tossed with salt .the curries were ok but not so appetizing their Bhindi was excellent and the naan was also lousily cooked I know the owner makes a lot of effort to improve it and i dont want to criticize but i was not happy this time but i know they can do better .",

The lamb curry was thick, spicy, and rich in potatoes. It made my stomach happy.  Stay away from the goat curry. That curry singlehandedly took away a star. It was flavorful enough, but it was thin and the quality of the meat was questionable.  The thalis won't disappoint - they're reminescent of thalis from north Indian dhabas.    The desserts are authentic. And they usually bring you out free fresh hot tea.  We went in a big group and our waiter was pretty darn good.",

The food was really good.  We ordered the vegdy appetizer platter, veggy meatball dish (skip this), garlic nan, and butter chicken.  Everything was delicious and not at all spicy.  I think the usual Indian buffets make things really spicy so you eat less, here I couldn't eat anymore b/c I was stuffed.

They hide the fact that they add 18% gratuity for themselves by making it look like part of the total amount you must pay, not an itemized suggested amount.   Pros: Great variety with a lot of dishes Good lunch prices Tasty dishes no matter what you order Beautiful ambience  Cons: Dinner prices are higher than most Indian places Some staff can be truculent if you do or ask for anything that apparently isn't to her liking Deceitful w/ bills  (As mentioned above, they print very archaic-looking bills w/ only numbers so you must remember exactly what you ordered and what it cost. But read it carefully!! It is itemized first by food & drink, then food & drink + tax, then food & drink + tax + 18% tip. So it's easy to assume the number at the bottom is your total WITHOUT TIP, which leads most people to double tip them unknowingly. I've seen my coworkers miss this every time. Makes me really wonder if they aren't intentionally making their bills cryptic and confusing... )",

    "text": "*Update* I received a lovely response from the owner regarding the Groupon. That's the first time any owner has responded to one of my reviews and it's refreshing. They deserve a 4 star rating for that!  Let me preface this review by saying this was my first time trying Indian food and I just don't care for most of the flavors involved so this is going to be less about food than the experience.  I met a few friends here for dinner tonight. The staff is very friendly. Nice ambiance and the table comes prepared for you with water and their flat bread with sauces and that's a plus. I will say after reviewing the menu it's rather pricey.  My friend ordered the appetizer combo plate and it turned out its literally a dish that just combines everything into one plate. Interesting but not bad. I ordered a vegetarian rice dish as I'm not a meat eater, with peas, tomatoes, onions, and Indian cheese. It was fairly basic and bland and although you get a healthy portion it seems pricey for what it is at $11. I sampled a bit of everyone's dishes and (again my tastebuds) it wasn't really my thing.  I ordered the chilli naan bread and I will say that was amazing! I could eat a stack of that alone.  Me and a friend purchased a Groupon that day to use... $16 for $30...great deal! But they wouldn't let us use them because we bought them the same day. I read all the fine print and nowhere does it mention this so that was irritating. I am getting my money back for the Groupon as I don't think it's a place I'll go back to.   I want to be clear that I think this place is a great representation of fine Indian cuisine;  I'm just not a curry fan, etc so if you're an Indian food lover please try this place. Lovely ambiance and staff! Just keep in mind about the Groupon.",

The atmosphere is upscale, although it is a little quieter than I'd prefer. Everything in the restaurant is high quality, from the tables and chairs, to the plates and utensils, to the decor around the building.   The food was excellent. I ordered my favorite dish - tikki masala with tofu, and it was delicious. The flavors were hearty and deep. The rice was cooked perfectly. Very nice meal.   It is a little pricey but the food and service make up for it. Also it would be nice to have a little bit more parking available; if there are no spots available up front there is a lot around back. It looks a little sketchy but it seems to be a safe place to park your car.   I would definitely recommend this place as I had a great meal there and I will come back again soon!",

    "text": "Good quality North Indian (Punjabi) food. Everything we ordered didn't come out perfect, but whatever did, deliciously compensated for what was missed.   The dreary details: It was our 2nd time here, hence the review. Pretty consistent with our first visit a year ago. Went for lunch both the times as a party of 4. All dishes were ordered at a spice level of 7/10.   First came the sweet lassi (yoghurt with sugar) and my friends got the cumin/pepper water drink. We liked both.  Our appetizer was the tandoori platter, a combination of the 3 meats below,  Sheek Kabab - Excellent. Will repeat it. The meat's flavor enhanced perfectly with mild herbs & spices. Chicken Kabab - A tad dry but with the red Chilli sauce, it was good. Shrimp - Will pass next time. Not well marinated in the spices. Was bland I thought.  Followed by,   Bhatura - Excellent. Deep fried but not soaking in oil. Soft and yum (psst.. Have a huge weakness for fried food) Chole - Okay.  The mixed vegetable pickle that came with it was so homely.. and the 3 together - \\m/ :)  Chicken Tikka Masala - Thanks to fellow yelpers, we tried it and have no regrets. Rogan Gosht - Made of Lamb (should have been Mutton). Okay. Overpowering tomato taste, may not try again. Both curries came with plain basmati rice. Garlic Naan (yeah.. Not done with our order yet. We had soooo much food) - Excellent. Wouldn't always get such soft, garlicky naans even back home in India.  Aloo (Potato) Kulcha - Good.  Finally, the Chicken Biriyani. Bad. Was more like Pulav. The rice was sticky, not very flavorful. Won't try that again. But the rest of the gang (very Indian husband and 2 American friends) liked it. I like the biriyani at Kabab Palace better.  That's about it. We went at noon on a Saturday and were served without much wait time. They actually do allow reservations as early as 11:30 am. Staff are friendly. Though overpriced, we shall return to try other delicacies from their long list of menu items. For instance.. Missed the kurkure bhindi both the times. :/",

    "text": "I came here on a date, having read good reviews and knowing friends who like it here... and I was less than impressed.  First off, I made reservations, and we still had to wait. We were right on time, there were empty tables, and I was a little confused. After being sat by our wholly unenthusiastic hostess-slash-waitress, we waited FOREVER to get in our drink order. We perused the huge menu for quite some time, thought about getting an appetizer, but ended up skipping the app because we figured we would be there all night long if we did. (in retrospect, a smart move.)  When the food came, it was pretty good, but a little bland. I'd maybe try different dishes if there's a next time. I could see people complaining that the portions are on the smaller side, but I thought they were OK. Not great, but okay.   Minus a star for the fact that our wine never came until our food showed up, and I had to politely remind our server. Being on a date, this really was killer. Would have been nice to loosen up convo with a nice glass of wine, and we ended up both getting one glass instead of two.   All in all, super disappointing. Thought it was going to be a fun, interesting experience, and looked forward to doing something different. But this place is firmly OUT of my \"dating restaurants\" rotation. Maybe I'll come back with friends? If we had a super nice waitress who suggested dishes and treated us well, it could have been great. (and, it doesn't have a very romantic ambiance... we were so far apart when sitting at our \"table for 2\" that we joked about having convo via carrier pigeon.)   Factor in the fact that it's kind of expensive, and yeah... 2 stars all the way.",

We order the Punjab Veggie Platter and Tandoori Khazana as appetizers, which are sampler plates containing samosas, veggie and paneer pakora, shrimp, tandoori chicken and some kind of kebab (veggies on one and meat on the other). Everything on the veggie platter was great. I only tried the tandoori chicken from the other platter and found it a bit dry, every everyone else seemed to love everything on the plate so maybe it was just me.   I got the Chicken Makhani with a spice level of 6. It was absolutely phenomenal, as was the garlic (BUTTERY) naan we got for the table. FYI that 6 wasn't spicy to me so it's definitely on an American scale. There is no way the calories they quote are correct, but I probably don't want to see the real ones.   The prices are a little high, but the portions are large and the food was very high quality. I would not hesitate to come back.",

We had never been to The Dhaba before but were very excited to dine there. We live about 45 minutes away and were running about 15 minutes behind so I had my husband call the restaurant to let them know and see if we would still be able to dine there if we arrived at 7:45. The person he spoke to let my husband know that they would still be able to accommodate us at 7:45 but that there was cleaning that was going to be taking place after closing that night so they would not be able to accommodate us if we were there any later.   We arrived at the restaurant at 7:44 and approached the front door, which was locked. There were multiple parties still dining at the time we arrived. We attempted to call the restaurant and no one picked up the phone. There was no one staffing the host/hostess station. One of the waitresses saw us and basically ignored us. Additionally, the sign on the door stated they were open until 8:30pm  I was pretty irritated due to the fact that we called ahead of time to let them know we would be there by 7:45 and they told us they would serve us. After driving all of that way and then have the door locked on us and be ignored is not ok. EVER.   We will be telling all of our friends and family about this and urge them to stay away from this establishment.",

I had the Khanaza Tandoori platter and she had the Chicken Tikka Masala. Everything was delicious and above par for PHX Indian food.  Try the Kashmiri Naan with a spicy vindaloo  February 2019 Update - so if there was an option for more stars I would give them wholeheartedly!! Everything from my first review remains True while I would like to add they have updated the beer and wine list and I am now IN LOVE with all of there Korma dishes!!

    "text": "I happened to be drawn to The Dhaba while traveling eastbound on Apache toward the 101. Something about the building, the restaurant and market, I'm not quite sure but I knew I wanted to check it out.   I ended up inquiring with others who have had it and they had only good things to say. So, I went in to order some take out the following day.   The menu all sounded good although admittedly there were so many items that in placing a to-go order I didn't really have the time to review all options available. I went with the Saag, with a level 7 spice. You really never know how spicy a 7 is going to be. I also ordered the curried goat for a colleague, along with their gluten free bread and a masala chai tea.  I will admit I was a bit bummed out when I took the meal back and there were no utensils and the rice was in a single container. Although, I am green conscious and it's probably for the better that there was less waste.   I was surprise that the chai was hot, I'm not sure why I expected it to be cold but I did. Nevertheless it was delicious, although next time I might order something else. The saag? Amazing! Like, no joke! Who would have thought something so pureed and spinach would be so good? I certainly didn't. Not the mention the level of spice was perfect! There were no complaints from my colleague although I didn't mention I'm quite the yelper.   Upon entering The Dhaba there is a wall of pride with award after award. The owner was actually who greeted me and was a very pleasant man, I truly do wish I had the chance to dine in and get a different experience. This just means I'll have to head back.   I will say it was a bit pricy, though in my world, all good food seems to be from the grocery store to the smoothie joint, sometimes when you want the quality, you gotta pay the price, literally.   Definitely a new fave! For sure.",

I loved the decor and we ordered an option where you could choose an appetizer, two main dishes, and a dessert. The stand out of our meal was the chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan.  We also had the Chana palak and that was ok. I also enjoyed the vast selection of Indian wines that they recommend pairing with chicken, lamb, or vegetarian selections.

I've only been to one other place, so I can't exactly say if this place is very traditional or the best, but I can say it taste amazing.  I get the chicken tikka masala.  They give you a very good portion and the flavor is spot on.  They ask you what level of spice you want.  I'm a baby so I get the 1 out of 10 which is perfect for me; while it reduces the spicy it doesn't lack any flavor.  Like I mentioned the staff is very nice.

I have had my share of Indian food and while it was certainly delicious, there's no reason for the jacked up prices.  Service was OK but we did have to remind them for water refills and they also forgot the extra chutney sauce we asked for.  Samosa chaat: ok but underwhelming. Definitely overpriced. They are stingy with the amount of samosa and it could have used more tamarind chutney and yogurt.  Dhaba chicken curry: my least favorite. Not flavorful and really boring. Maybe if I asked for the dish to be extra spicy it would have tasted better.  Dhaba lamb curry: decent! We ordered it mild but it had a deep hearty flavor.  Kashmiri chicken tikka masala: the star of the night! I ordered it to be 10/10 spicy but it was more like 3/10 spicy. Still delicious and my absolute favorite.   Rice pudding: very yummy and a nice way to end the meal. This was the free dessert that came with the Yelp check in deal. I was expecting gulab jamun honestly but this was  a nice surprise.  Again, like I stated, none of the dishes were bad. In fact, they were very high quality and the talent of the chef is evident. I'm just highly turned off by the fact that the portion sizes are so small despite being $16-$18 per entree. The samosa chaat appetizer alone was $8 and it was tiny with very few samosa pieces.  The restaurant itself was very cozy and felt authentic.",

    "text": "We went to this restaurant based on the reviews on yelp with a Groupon.  I had high expectations, but I was disappointed and here is why:  - The service was VERY slow (this is not the reason for my one star because understandably it was a Groupon night and it was quite busy)  - The food was tasteless when we asked for spicy.  One of the appetizers we ordered was Paneer Tikka and it was extremely bland - not marinated at all, hard, dry and did not taste like Paneer Tikka.  We ordered two curries for our main course and had same problem again, it didn't taste like the items we ordered.    - Worst of all - a roach crawled below our table and one of the guys from the table adjacent to us decided to squish it right there.  It sat there the entire time we were there - eating our meal - a couple of steps away.  The restaurant didn't bother to clean it even after the table emptied out.  I don't think I will be going back here.  May be I have high/different expectations due to the fact that I have enjoyed some really awesome Indian food in the east coast and also because I am Indian.  May be the restaurant targets non-Indian crowd with a bit milder/suddle taste - even then, if the food is absolutely bland, when you ask for spicy, it is NOT Indian food.   Hope this was helpful and if you do end up going here, I hope you have a better experience!",

Having been born and brought up in India, I always compared them to what the real thing is supposed to taste like and none met my liking. I tried the Dhaba, a little while ago and was very pleasantly surprised by the taste and quality. The food was quite authentic and I visit there frequently. I have tried quite a few things on the menu and the chicken and mutton selections are very good. But the winner is (....insert drum roll here....)  the maa ki daal (black daal). It truly reminded me of home.  The Phoenix area has quite a few indian restaurants but none that I would re-visit. Now I have finally found one that has good Punjabi food. BTW, the Chaat cafe next door is pretty good too. When I don't feel like a regular meal and am craving some good \"street\"  food, this is my choice. Hope this place stays around, so I can have a place to satisfy my Indian food cravings.",

Plus, because everything was in Punjabi, we had to read the descriptions of each dish.  Luckily, there were papadams and chutneys to snack on.  All the dishes sounded really good!  We ended up getting the tandoori khazana with a mix of chicken and lamb tandoori that was super tasty.  The lamb and the shrimp were succulent and flavorful, and the chicken really captured the smoky tandoori flavor.  Our second dish was palak paneer and our third was the lamb korma.  The paneer was pretty good, and the spinach quite creamy, and with just the slightest bit of heat.  The lamb korma was awesome.  The curry is similar to tikka masala but way better with cashews and raisins; the lamb was first rate in flavor and tenderness of the meat.  We also ordered dessert: pistachio ice cream made on site.  It was icy and delicious and melted in your mouth with an amazing creaminess.  The pistachio flavor really shined in the dessert.  We left stuffed!  What a great meal!  The ambiance was very nice, with beautiful colors and a warm feeling.  The lighting was not too bright, but not so dark that you couldn't see the food on your plate.  The servers were chatty and pleasant. But the cart they wheeled dishes out on seemed really out of place.  Overall, I'd come here again if I were in the area.  A great experience and a delicious dinner.",

I won't be able to tell the difference from cuisines from different parts of India, but I can tell the difference between really good and flavorful Indian food.  THE PLACE: Located in a small plaza with small shops, including an Indian market. It smells marvelous in the market. They sell all kinds of spices, a lot of english products (no surprise), even some frozen, heat and eat indian dishes. Don't forget to pick up some home mades sweets too. Place provides ample parking for all the businesses in the plaza. The restaurant itself, is not that big, but it is comfortable. Always clean.  THE SERVICE: Friendly and helpful. Not certain what to get? What goes together well? Don't hesitate to ask. Granted I make it a point to avoid busy hours, my experience has always been excellent. Always attentive. I'm not a soda drinker so I really appreciate an establishment that makes sure I have all the aqua I need in my cup.  THE FOOD: Vegan, vegetarian, omnivore or carnivore, you are welcome here. Everything is so flavorful. Don't ever skip on the Naan or Roti's, they are so good. Of course, it is best when consumed with the fabulous dishes such as Paneer Tikka Masala (I can bathe in the sauce --- so good!). Shehenshahi Palak Kofta is another good one. My kids and hubby enjoy the lamb dishes too. Oh, and the saffron basmati rice, smells so good and just compliments every dish. Hungry yet? I am.  A definite winner and favorite.",

My first time there, everything was clean and neat, the server was so polite and patient with me and my mom having no clue what anything on the menu is.   I liked how my server asked me on a scale from 1-10 how spicy do I want my food, I said 5 and it was just right.   I wish I knew what me or my mom ordered but I had a cheesy thin yellow sauce with a few vegetable dumplings in it with basmati rice and garlic naan. I got full on less than half of it which is strange because I usually almost finish my food at restaurants.  My mom had really tender chicken in very thin red sauce with bell pepper and onion sizzling on a hot pan. All of it was perfect, I can't wait to go back.",

The service is consistently pretty good, and the food the best Indian food I've had in Phoenix. The menu remains extensive and caters to a variety of tastes, preferences, and diets, so this place is a pretty great option for anyone who isn't averse to Indian food.  The prices remain high, but fair. The Dhaba does however frequently offers discount coupons on Groupon and similar websites, in addition to participating in reward programs for Delta, Opentable, and the like. Be sure to take advantage of these offers, and you'll rack up plenty of discounts, free food, and assorted benefits in addition to the soul-affirming deliciousness that I love this place for.  You should really stop reading and make a reservation. Like, now.   (That is, unless you're reading this at 1 AM for some reason, in which case you need to go to bed already.)",

One was a younger lady who seemed to be irritated that we had little experience ordering at an Indian restaurant and needed a little help with the menu. When she attempted to explain her accent was so thick we still found it hard to understand what we were doing. when asked to repeat herself she became even more irritated and only spoke louder, she then left the table and could be overheard saying 'I don't know what to tell her' in reference to my date's very basic questions.   Then an older lady who appeared to be the owner came to our table and was fantastic, she explained everything to us and was very attentive for the rest of the meal.   I would eat there again however it seems that they are big on making reservations. This didn't really occur to us as it was late Friday afternoon and we were thinking we'd get an early 'happy hour' dinner in at the end of a busy day rather than going home and getting ready for a later more formal dinner later in the evening.   All in all, good food, good service if you have reservations if this is your first time with Indian food do your homework before getting there and you should be fine.",

Parking is extremely limited in the area (as it's a shopping center as well). I noticed a couple come in without a reservation, and were sort of put off by it.  They do have a little seating area if you forget, and wait time seems to be about 10-15 minutes or so...  That aside, let's talk about the food:  I always leave VERY full here, with leftovers for the next day. Their Kormas are divine. I will recommend the vegetarian option as it comes with cashews and golden raisins...a little spicy, sweet, and tart, and savory --- basically a perfect meal. The girls (servers) here are efficient, without being pushy, and attend to each table flawlessly.   It gets an extra star from me, today, for the decor. Restaurants really underestimate the power of nice surroundings. The Dhaba definitely took this into consideration when selecting the tableware, the lighting options, tables ect.  Oh, and P.S. get the Groupon, or check in on yelp/foursquare to score some amazing deals (I don't know why they keep doing this, because they're giving away food for free...but yeah, ya know, not complaining at the moment).",

    "text": "This is part of India Plaza.  As you would expect, it is an Indian restaurant.  Punjabi, more specifically.  I had heard good things from Indian folks I know, but it took me a while to come in.  First, don't confuse the cafe next door with The Dhaba.  It's all part of the same plaza, same owner.  But the cafe has a much different menu (much simpler).    The Dhaba is relatively small.  Perhaps 10 tables.  Reservations are a good idea if you want to be sure to get a table without waiting.  The ambiance is simple, understated.  The plates and utensils are rather unique.  Metal plates (with some sort of different metal rim piece).  I'm assuming these are traditional.  The menu is quite extensive.  I didn't really know what most of the items were.  There is vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian.  But no beef, which was not really a surprise.  The samosas were very good.  They were served with a chick-pea dip (or soup?), that was also really good.  We played it \"safe\" and went with vindaloo and tikka masala, and both were excellent also.  My wife did have the mango lasse, and she said it was good but not as good as India Oven.  The rest, however, was better.  The naan bread is not included, you have to order it.  It's good, but I think it should be included as it is in most other Indian restaurants.  Now for the bummer:  the price.  The Dhaba is probably 30% more expensive than the next best Indian restaurant we've found (India Oven).  Maybe 40%.  It was all good, but definitely pricey (despite Yelp's scale being \"moderate\"...at perhaps $20 per person including tip) compared to others in its category.  If you use \"Groupon\" they sometimes have one for The Dhaba, and it really helps.  The one I've seen you pay $20 for $40 of food.  We went over $40, and the final bill (after Groupon) was about what I would expect to pay at India Oven.  Is it worth it?  With a Groupon, Yes!  Without, well, that's up to you.  It is really good Indian food.",

I'm particularly partial to paneer dishes, sort of a cow milk-based tofu. The garlic naan is to die for, and the mango lassi is a wonderful way to tame the heat. Choose your spice level wisely. I love spicy food, but even I was suffering a little at a spice level of 8 -- weak tongues beware!   My friends and I used to come during our very strict lunch hour. We always explained to the staff our time limitation, and they were always extremely accommodating.  Although a little bit pricey at dinner, the lunch menu here is an amazing deal -- at $10-$15 for a huge meal, including gravy, naan, rice, and lentils, there is no way you'll leave feeling unsatisfied.",

A fine choice of restaurant if you are in the Phoenix area.  The meal starts with fried papad with 3 chutneys.  For appetizers we tried the much recommended Chicken tikka samosa and paani puri & dahi papdi chaat.  The chicken tikka samosa is yummy.  We ordered garlic naan and lamb biryani for the main course.  All the food we ordered were good.  For dessert, I tried the rasmalai which was great!  Service was a clear winner.  The ambience of the restaurant is great and they also have a bar.

    "text": "First time at the Dhabi---attracted by the great Yelp reviews.  The restaurant is attractive with lots of mirrors and indian themed decor.   We were seated at an unusually large square table that had  great distance between the diners (one if front of the other)---Was not good for conversation.   The menu is extensive with terms I was unfamiliar with despite eating Indian food on a weekly basis.  We were given two papadum with chutney (coriander, tamarind) and a hot sauce which was brutal but quite tasty.  We ordered chicken biryani and chicken vindaloo accompanied by brown basmati rice which was a surprising choice.  The brown rice was cooked perfectly.  The biryani was a generous portion.  However, the rice was unusually mushy--I prefer grainy rice.  I must say that  it was not greasy at all.  The vindaloo was spicy (as most are) but the sauce was missing something like fenugreek or some other spices/herbs.  The pieces of potatoes in the Vindaloo were barely cooked through. This is an almost universal problem with vindaloos.  The pieces of chicken were small but enough for one serving.   The pricing is higher than most considering it is in Tempe.  They charge $10 for two Samosas and we decided not to get them.  I have eaten indian food in New York and Paris and never was I charged $10 for two samosas.  So I would say that the Dhabi did not wow me taste wise.  Considering that we told them it was our first time,  NO ONE came to the table to check on us, to ask how we were enjoying the food, etc.  Waters were refilled but that's about it.  Perfunctory service",

    "text": "This place literally screams QUALITY Indian food. Just take a look at the pictures. Not a single picture which is looks oily, creamy (except for the yogurt in Samosa Chaat but that is supposed to be like that), and messy.   The Samosa Chaat tasted really good, in terms of restaurant quality chaat. I think the chutneys might have been a bit too tangy, but it was still worth tasting. The Chole Bhatura was really good. Not too oily, and the chole itself was really tasty. I wish the Bhatura was a bit fluffier, but I think it was healthier this way. Finally, the Baingan Bharta was good in terms of quality, but in terms of taste was just a little bit lacking. I personally think it could have been a bit more flavorful by adding some more tomatoes and masala, but that could also be just me. The onion naan was also kind of bland, as I was expecting the onions to be spiced up a lot more to give the onion naan that type of masala flavor that it usually comes with.  Overall, I was pleased with the food and my experience here! I will definitely be coming back.",

Lucky us, there was 1 table that didnt have a reserved sign on it so note ...make a reservation.  The host was really friendly and gave some recommendations to try. We started with their chicken tikka samosas ...they came paired with  chick peas in a tomato type sauce and they were tasty. This item was a new creation for them and wasnt on the menu yet but glad we tried it.  For the main course we tried the chicken tikka masala and the kadahi jhinga (shrimp with vegetables in a tomato sauce) and garlic naan.  We enjoyed these dishes and ordered them medium spicy. If you eat spicy on a regular basis I'd say you want to up the level.  The chicken tikka masala was creamier than we prefer but still tasty. The shrimp was perfect.  Will def be back and will make resos next visit!",

My friend is vegan, so we ordered all vegan options:  - Chana Palak - Baingan Bhartha  - Tandoori Roti  Before our meal came out, we were served big, thin crackers with three different sauces: a sweet tamarind sauce, spicy chili sauce, and spicy herb sauce. This was a really nice beginning to a great meal. I wish they would have left the sauces so we could have enjoyed them with our entrees, too (I'll make sure to ask for that next time).   We also ordered two glasses of wine: a Chenin Blanc and a Sauvignon Blanc, both from India.   We ordered both entrees with a spice level of 4. The baingan bhartha - an eggplant dish - was bright, spicy, with robust flavors. However, the chana palak was the True star of our meal. Somehow, spinach, chickpeas, and spices were cooked into a creamy, subtly sweet, spicy, and ultra-flavorful dish and I found myself scraping my to-go container dry the next day.   The service was pleasant. It's a small place with just a few tables, which makes it feel homey. There's a market next door that I'd love to check out next time.   Overall, we loved our dining experience at the Dhaba and I will definitely be back!",

We went to the Dhaba on a recommendation from a friend and it outstripped the others by far. Tikka masala was nice and creamy with subtle spices; chicken makhni was a little too rich (can that be a thing??) but still packed with flavor; but the goat rogan josh was the star. Tender meat, bright but not punchy flavors and a rich sauce. The garlic naan was a nice balance of crisp and chewy too. The only downside to the meal was the less than attentive staff, but we don't mind a little downtime while we're out to eat. It may bother others. If you haven't been to the Dhaba, go. If you have been, go again.",

Many of our guests asked where I got the food, so I hope they come here on their own eventually.   For dinner I got 3 different curries with meat (2 chicken and 1 lamb) one veggie, some saffron rice and naan. The crowd favorite seemed to be the basic Chicken curry and the Lamb curry.   I would like to come here again for a sit down meal. Still, check this place out.",

This most recent visit is sharpest In My memory so I'll just write about that.  There was a group of 5 of us.  We started with samosas which were absolutely incredible.  Next, they brought out some regular and garlic naan (a must).  Next, they brought out 2 larger dishes of rice as well as 5 different curry plates.  One was lamb, two were chicken (one of them was the classic tikka masala), one was veggie and one was shrimp.  I've never had seafood in curry before but it was amazing.  The 5 of us shared a few bottles of beer, I forget the brand.  We were offered desert but the 5 of us were too stuffed.  For the portions, keep in mind it was a group of 5 guys aged 21-28 so you KNOW we can eat.  I highly recommend this place.  I would definitely let them choose a bunch of random dishes for a group.  It's more fun that way!",

I love Indian food and I've eaten at a dozen or more restaurants in the Valley... let me tell you, once I tried the Dhaba, I've never gone anywhere else! There's no other restaurant in Phoenix that beats the quality of the food here! Everything on the menu is a masterpiece and I've never walked away hungry or unsatisfied.  You start your meal with a complementary appetizer of papadums (large flat circular chips), served with an assortment of chutneys. My favorite dishes: Lahori Malai Kofta (vegetarian meatballs), Paneer Tikka Masala (cheese cubes in a tomato sauce), and Vegetable Korma (veggies in a creamy, nutty sauce). The best lamb dish I've tried is Kadahi Gosht, lamb in a spicy sauce with sauteed veggies. Your meal comes with a huge serving of rice and don't forget to order garlic naan!  The Dhaba is a small, intimate restaurant. Great for double dates or going out with your family if they're adventurous enough to try curry! I highly recommend making a reservation online. I've never had problems making same-day reservations, but I have been forced to wait 20 minutes as a walk in. (The wait is worth it!) The restaurant is in a small plaza with limited parking, but there's extra parking in the back. Be sure to check out the small Indian grocery and marketplace next door!   Many thanks to the owner Naveen for running such a wonderful establishment! Can't wait to be back for another feast soon!",

I first want to mention the extreme politeness I get whenever I call to place a take out order. They, unlike other Indian cuisine restaurants want my business...yours too; and it shows. The menu is very broad which I love. They have full vegan entrees, although I am not close to being vegan I do love alot of vegetable dishes and DHABA has many. The vegetable \"meatballs\" are outstanding. I have never had a bad meal hear although some of my favorite go-to foods I can find better eleswhere. So everytime I do eat here I get something new. My go to items by the way are Mushroom Matar, Palak paneer and a protein i.e. Lamb, goat or chicken. The dishes here always are fresh, fragrant, plentiful, bright and overall spiced very nice. I prefer VERY HOT food in temperature and they nail it; I prefer my food extremely hot in spice too which they tend to be mellow on for my taste buds. Please, Sir Chef...Go on and hurt me with the magical indian spices, it's ok. If I order a ten it should be blazing!! With all this said DHABA is unique in it's offerings, clean in presentation and overall a pretty good Indian joint!! I will continue to eat there. If you are an employee of ANY INDIAN restaurant in Arizona here me now. You are from the continent ASIA....take a cue from your counterparts and GIVE RICE WITH DISHES FOR FREE. JUST PLAIN WHITE RICE!! I do get irked that this cuisine charges for this plain starch.",

It was not served on a sizzling clay plate as it should be. The chicken did not taste grilled.  It was microwaved and served on a plate. The flavor was also lacking. Honestly, this is very amateurish and they simply cannot serve tandoor like this.  Also, the water was not served chilled with ice, it was served tapwater temperature and thus your thirst didn't feel quenched.  The vegetarian sabjis outside of palak panner and malai kofta was average.   Again, I dined here two more times after this and the quality of the food took a dip.",

Tony who brought us our food is so much fun to talk to and his stories were fun to listen to. I liked listening to his philosophy of dining which was people should come, relax and eat and not run off in a mad rush haha!  We had vegetable Korma which was very tasty (lacked a little salt but better less than more) and we totally loved the aloo kulcha! I would go back just to have the aloo kulcha.  Tony was really nice and gave us a free desert for the heck of it and we had a really nice kheer! We will definitely be going back there again!",

We didn't get our food until 9:30-- I was starving at that point. The food here was very good and the service was friendly.

    "text": "I walked into this place thinking: \"Oh man, you know the Americans(white dudes) are going to love this place\"  Flat screen tv's, nice tables, friendly service, trendy ambience, waiters who speak good English, white guy playing sitar at the front....this is white guys paradise...unfortunately the food itself was just above average. FYI, Indians from India (my parents) call all white dudes \"Americans\" as if we are not Americans but I thought would throw some humor your way in case you were already bored reading the typical \"The spiciness wasn't there\" review  In terms of the menu, I don't think Dhaba knows how it's trying to position itself. Are they a chaat house, a classic Indian restaurant, a fusion Indian restaurant....and that is the problem with this place, it's  a smorgasboard...a jack of all trades yet a master of none.  And that's exactly felt in the cuisine. The samosa chaat was amazing, the other chaat....bleh!  The chicken tikka masa was very good but the certainly not crave-worthy meaning  it lacked the\"Hey I'm dying for some great chicken tikka masala, let me order this to go\" quality. It's really hit or miss with their dishes as some are completely amateur like their chicken tikka(not the curry but the grilled version) which tasted like chicken cooked on a Forman grill and was then allowed to cool to room temperature and served on a plate...not exactly appetizing. Their daal was really good but their saag was okay.  And to Wendi below, we don't eat salads.  Indian people created salads for you guys. So when you tell me there is a new salad on the menu each day, I envision someone at a Chinese restaurant saying we are offering a different style of pizza today. That's a not a good thing. If the guy is listening to Pink Floyd, that means the dial is moving even further away on the authentic meter. What's next, are they going to start offerring hooka and child's chicken finger and fries plate? Don't get me wrong, Dhaba is one of the few Indian restaurants in Phoenix that I will actually dine at since most are terrible and that's not me being critical. Phoenix is a great place for bad Indian restaurants to thirve since the population is clueless when it comes to Indian food and you could seriously serve up some ground beef with curry and give it a name and they would think it's a legitimate and authentic dish...and this goes for the white dudes living in London who comes on these forums and tells us they know great Indian food when they give places like India Gate 5 stars....but I digress. Okay so if you are not an Indian food snob and want to break out of your routine of eating at Black Angus, this is a good place to start. If you have eaten great Indian food and are not easily mesmerized by a nice atmosphere go down McClintock and take a left on Broadway and try Royal Taj",

They even brought out the food for her earlier so she would not get impatient. The food was excellent as always and we ended up having an enjoyable, comfortable and delicious meal with our friend.

I loved the Saag Paneer -- it had just the right amount of kick and the cheese was spongy and not hard.  The naan was good, as was the rice, and my husband liked his Lamb Vindaloo.  The chai was also very good, and made even better by the free refills. :)   We didn't have any problems with service at all; to the contrary, even though there were only two staff members there, everyone was polite and attentive.  Why just three stars, you ask?  I knocked it two points for the portion size relative to the price.  I'm willing to pay more for quality food, sure, but it'd be nice if there was at least more of it.  The food was very good, but I think other Indian restaurants have comparable quality food for more reasonable prices.  The store next door is a lot of fun to browse, and if you're out to get fed for cheap, try their web site or <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> before you go -- both usually have coupons.",

The portion was modest (but fine for the avg. appetite in context with the other stuff), and the price included naan, rice, and a couple of other sides.  My friend ordered a vindaloo dish, which was a tad more in price and was just the curry. For him, the rice/naan was an add-on. It was a larger serving, but I think he felt a tad confused due to the different offerings included in my order.   Also, he felt it was pretty mild, though the menu and waiter mentioned it would be spicy hot. We mentioned this to the manager and he said that requesting more heat was an easy thing for them to do. So if you like to sweat when eating vindaloo (and other Indian fare), just be sure to make it clear when ordering.   In any case, it was a first visit so I'm not sure which are the best things to order and if ordering a combination - what is the best plan. I would venture to guess, however, that it would be a great place to go with a small group, then order a variety of things and share.",

The ambience is very relaxed but trendy/upscale compared with most Indian restaurants.  The owner is extremely gracious and the service is excellent.  The food is absolutely delicious!  Really, the best in town.  Their lamb, usually a good test of the chef's skill, is perfect... juicy, flavorful, very tender.  It practically melts in your mouth.  Everything I've eaten here has been excellent and I'm an adventurous diner who tries many different dishes.  The prices are very reasonable and they frequently send coupons if you sign up for their email list.

My husband on the other hand was getting pretty antsy.  I think we were told at least 4 times that it would be another 10 mins , then another 5 mins, and so on.    Once seated it took another 15 mins to have someone take our order.  We were advised that the restaurant was really busy and to be patient.  I was trying to be a good sport since we were celebrating and just went with it.  Once we ordered the food actually came out rather quickly.  The food was excellent, I just wish that they had provided more rice.  We had tried to order 4 orders of Naan.  The woman who took our order told us that we shouldn't do that, that it was too much food.  My husband loves naan and we eat Indian food enough that we know.  So she talked us down to 2.  Wish we had gotten more *sigh*.    The food was delicious and the restaurant was cute and cozy.  But I don't think we will be back.  The wait was too long and we live in central phoenix, so it isn't convenient to where we live.",

We were a group of 11 and we had a good time in their just having fun and enjoying the food. They served in copper plates and copper tumblers. The food was excellent we pretty much ordered the whole vegetarian menu n like a chicken dish.. The taste reminded of food back home.  They even had a big screen TV playing Indian music videos, some of musics were the once we grew up with. Brought back memories. Me n my friends still talk about the food in dhaba n the experience we had in there. A memorable time to cherish and maybe go visit this place one day.",

    "text": "The Dhaba is definitely one of the best Indian food restaurants in the Valley by far!!!  The other one we like is the Dheli Palace for their lunch buffet.  We usually try a lunch buffet first before deciding whether to invest in dinner cause Indian cuisine is very pricey. Due to all the rave reviews we decided to go for it and have become fans ever since.  We are always surprised when the place is not so busy because the food is excellent.  I think the fact that they do not have a buffet has something to do with this.  For most who are not familiar with the cuisine of India, ordering can be a daunting task which is why buffets really work with Indian food.  I am of Indian decent (1st generation) so I know my way around the dishes and have been able to guide both friends and family through the rich assortment of Indian dishes, but if you don't have a guide it can be a little scary, just saying, a buffet might be the way to go to give business a boost.  We love the Dhaba, give it a shot you will not be disappointed.",

I have visited the dhaba over 5 times with friends or my wife, and every time I have felt the food could taste better or I could cook better than that. Food is good if you aren't Indian.  The food is definitely way too over-priced, so is the grocery store next to it, both have the same owner. Recently I went into the restaurant and saw the Indian receptionist girl treating Americans and Indians differently, guess they don't want Indian people coming to their businesses.  My biggest complaint - the kitchen closes at 9:15pm (even on weekends), and they don't let you in after 9pm unless you have a reservation.",

We were seated at a table near the front which wasn't the greatest - right next to the hostess stand and by the door to the connected shop next door. So guests and staff were going through the door right next to me throughout our meal. If you're seated there I would recommend asking for a different table! Service was a little bit slow, took 10-15 minutes until our order was taken. Water glasses were refilled regularly. We enjoyed the vege appetizer platter, but unfortunately it really filled us up and we didn't have much appetite for the mains. The spice level in my main was disappointing. We were asked on ordering - I asked for a 7, assuming that a 10 would be very hot, and a 7 would be about a medium-hot. My '7' malai kofta was very mild, and my husband's aloo ghobi (also a '7') was really lacking in flavor and spice, extremely mild. The garlic naan was very good. We ended up boxing the rest of our mains to take home, it tasted better the next day.  Overall experience okay, but just a little disappointing, perhaps since we'd seen the reviews on here were so good! Probably won't come back here again.",

During the course of our meal, someone asked us about the quality of food and when we gave feedback, the individual (works or owns the restaurant) countered by a stupid smirk and roll of eyes / face (indian style)... that was just too funny!   The menu offers the world but most of the stuff is either not avail or they have run out of it.  I do not get the concept of printing a multi page busy menu but only offering a few selection.    The quality of food was below average.  I am an Indian and believe me, it was just ok, passing grade.  I have had better and infact ate way better over the weekend at another Indian Restaurant in downtown scottsdale.    The service was good and courteous but we had to literally ask the waiter various times to get us different things over the course of the meal.  At an Indian place putting chutneys, salt/pepper on the table should be standard.    So, overall - food was below average, service was good, ambience was good, value for money - not good.

One thing that I warn is do not drink the water there. It tastes like it is fresh out of that man made Tempe man made beach. The server was an asian lady who kind of had an attitude. The food was ok and I hope that it is not the best Indian food in Phoenix. It's worth going to but it is very dirty and a bit scary. I wonder what the kitchen looks like?",

Interesting assortment of menu items, good service (mostly)... some observations 1.  There are some appetizer menu items that are purported to be \"Indian Street treats\".  We have come across these before... excellent!  We tried the papdi chaat, which proved superior to others we've had.  (If this is what people eat on the streets of India, perhaps it's time to visit...) 2.  They offer thali platters, which doesn't seem common in Phoenix.  Wonderful to have a variety of tastes to try.  \"Medium\" spice was not very hot. 3. Two different servers were taking care of our table.  They kept repeating each other's actions.  We asked for a box, one went to get a box... the other comes up and cheerfully asks, \"Would you like a box?\"  Same with dessert and the check. 4.  The unisex bathroom is designed such that if you are sitting (hovering) on the toilet, you are face-to-face with a urinal.  We will go back.  Especially if another <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon appears.",

The space and service is warm and inviting.  But it's the food that will have us coming back.  Fresh, delicious, you can tell that they toast and grind their own spices.  My daughter always orders chicken pakora, which I usually find very blah, but at Dhaba it was fabulous--moist, tender white meat fried perfectly in a light crispy batter with just the right amount of spice.  And the paneer pakora was even better.  From the appetizers (try the bhatura chole!) onward, our meal was the best we've had in any Indian restaurant in the SE valley so far.  Oh, and it's a plus that they have white wines by the glass that compliment the food.",

    "text": "This place just opened up about a week ago, and I think it's a great addition to the Indian restaurants in the Valley.  My husband and I went to eat dinner here last night and, even late on a Monday, it was crowded. Beware - it's a small space, so if you are going on a weekend, I would call for reservations.  The restaurant, located next to the India Plaza on Apache Blvd., is really inviting - it's decorated with bright colors, nice, thick tables and contemporary lights and wall hangings. It has quite a different feel than most Indian restaurants in the Valley. It has fun, upbeat music playing too, although I think it could have been turned down a  *little* to make it easier to talk. I loved the menu, because it is quite varied, offering the 'usual' suspects as well as some different items like Goan fish curry, bitter melon curry, goat curries, and gobi manchurian. AND, it also serves chaat.  My husband and I, however, decided to stick with the more typical offerings for the night. He got the \"La Jawab Kadahi Gosht\" which was lamb pieces and veggies in a spicy yogurt sauce. It was seasoned really well and delicious. I ordered the malai kofta, which was also delicious and seasoned just perfectly. The rice and naan we ordered were tasty, and I loved the side of raita - instead of just a simple yogurt and cucumber dish that the restaurants around here typically serve, this raita had some veggies mixed in and, I think, little puffed wheat pieces. Yum! All the food comes in copper bowls and plates, too, which I love. The service was quite friendly, albeit a little slow (it took a while to get our food) - however, we felt that was more to do with ironing out some first-week kinks, rather than an indicator of anything more serious.  If you like Indian food, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try.",

I have been to many Indian places in the PHX area and this is by far my favorite.  I went this past weekend. I went for dinner on Friday and went again for lunch the next day.  I ended up buying some spice in the adjoining Indian market.  It is small and has a lot of charm.  It is well decorated and attractive.  The food was the best part, however.    Between the two visits, I had a mix of lamb, chicken and vegetarian dishes.  My favorites were:  Ambala Tiki Chaat, Murg Vindaloo and the Kurkuri Bhindi.  All of the vegetables were fresh.  The naan is perfect for soaking up the great sauces.  We had Punjabi Pista Kesar for dessert and were pleasantly surprised by the unique flavors.  Lastly, the mango lassi was perfect for compensating for the spicy food.    I suggest ordering different dishes and sharing.  The large metallic plates are great for this.  I plan on returning here often.  I hope they take the concept to Scottsdale but it is worth the short drive.",

The grocery store next door had so many interesting foods and condiments. One thing that struck me was that no matter which box of prepackaged meals I picked up, the ingredient list was all of real food and spices... No ingredients you couldn't pronounce. What a novel idea... I'm excited to bring my Indian friend here. She and I have eaten at many Indian places around the valley and I really think she'll love this place. For dinner, I had the Ambala Tiki Chaat as an appetizer... wonderful! And Tikki Masala. As good as many I've had. And Lahori Malai Kofta which is a vegetarian substitute for meatballs. It consists of dumplings made out of paneer (cottage-cheese), cauliflower florets, carrots and potatoes in a rich and creamy sauce. I'd never had it before, but recommend it highly! I'll be back to The Dhaba again very soon!!",

The lamb was the highlight of the meal.  The sauce it was in was  delicious.  For me it was the right amount of spice without being too hot.  The naan was also full of flavor either alone or dipped in the remaining lamb sauce or raita.   Unfortunately the chicken was too dry so I didn't eat much of it.  The rest of the included food was good but not exceptional.   I would go here again but next time I will stick to lamb and naan.",

I just asked for Poori and curry, but what I got was a half fried poori (it was totally raw in places and it felt like I had ordered it with a side of oil !

The Aloo Tikka for the appetizers was pretty damn bad too, i mean it was like eating a patties made out of powdered potato or something, Again, no flavour in that, the naan had residue of some sort on them and the okra curry... pfft... im sick of typing.. u get the point right?

There might be ten tables at most and reservations are a must.  They actually had to turn away people while we were eating.  The menu is enormous, the foods well described and the choices unique--even for Punjabi cuisine.  The chili stuffed Naan was delicious and different.  The chicken vindaloo was rich and fragrant, if a little on the tepid side of the heat scale for me-- but then again just about all food is unless I order it spicy.  The okra was the best I have ever had and my wife's chicken tikki was superb.  The food was served quickly and the servers were friendly although a bit distracted.  We drove 45 minutes from Anthem to eat here and we will return.  I highly recommend The Dhaba.",

Overall a pleasant experience, but not likely one I will repeat on my own accord.  In Dhaba's defense, they have a lot of competition when it comes to small Indian food places in the valley, so I can't give it a 4 compared to some of the excellence I've experienced at its competitors. My BF and I both tried the sampler platters, meat and vegetarian.  The salad we started off with was excellent, the dressing was fantastic and they had these crunchy balls on top, almost like a cereal.  The entrees were just okay, my masala was very good, but everything else I could have done without.  Also there was no spice whatsoever in any of the dishes, very disappointing.   The pricing was reasonable; I was surprised some of the reviews mentioned it was expensive.  I think Dhaba is probably a great place to start if you don't typically eat ethnic foods with a lot of flavor or spice.  We both left feeling satisfied, but like the meal was missing something.",

Indian has always rated as my #1 favorite food and I have tried MANY different Indian food restaurants throughout the greater Phoenix area (extending all the way up to north Glendale even) in my search for \"the best Indian food\". The Dhaba easily stands a head above the rest.  Consistently delicious food coupled with consistently good service and a HUGE menu make The Dhaba an easy decision for any night out. My personal favorite, albeit a predictable choice, is the Chicken Tikka Masala. Paired with an order of naan, it is always a dependable option and serving portions are more than adequate. (I always have leftovers.)  Prices are not \"cheap\", but I have never spent my money so quickly and cheerfully as for an order at The Dhaba and you really do get what you pay for in both quality and quantity. Being able to order takeout is also a wonderfully valuable convenience.  The interior is intimate and traditionally decorated. The staff is friendly and polite. Attached to the dining area is an Indian food market with all sorts of delicious foods including fresh veggies, spices, and rice at SUPER affordable prices and even a small boutique including trinkets, natural medicines, books, and even clothing!  The Dhaba is unique because it truly provides a total experience. It's a little community unto itself. Be sure to give yourself time to take it all in when you visit. Relax and enjoy some food, then visit the grocery and boutique. When you get home, write them a solid Yelp review and then show the place off to all your friends like I have!  :)",

So far, I have tried three different Indian restaurants in the valley and this is the best of all three. Although the lunch portion looks small, it was pretty filling. I just wish they had only a little bit more rice and the naan was cooked through completely cause I had some bites that were quite doughy. Lunch prices are very good but a la carte would be slightly more expensive especially if you order appetizers and drinks. Overall the lunch experience was very good and ended with a rice pudding (included) which was delicious. Will be going there again.",

It seems to be little more costly as compared to other Indian restaurant in Phoenix/Tempe/Chandler area.  For ex: Veg Thali was around $17+tax which only includes 2 curry, 1 daal, 1 naan, rice, small portion of desert with Masala Tea. This is not enough for the price which has been asked.  I had Thali in other indian restaurant but they provided more items in less price.  Hoping that they will add more items in Thali which can justifies it's price.",

So many great things. Exploring around is a great time killer. Tons of spices, incense, wall hangings, plethorae of Buddha decorative items, etc.   Back to restaurant... I'm a newbie to indian food, so I won't go into detail regarding what we ordered. We went off the recommendations of our server. The food was to die for. The naan bread made with pistachios and other yummy items is to die for!! We all ordered our spice level at 3 - on a scale of 1-10. 3 was almost way too hot. If you're not a fan of spice/heat be weary. I'll I'll probably do a 1 next time as I'm not a fan of burning my face off.   Nice little bonus, if you check in on Yelp you will receive a free rice pudding dessert. It's pretty darn yummy with spices and a fruit swirl on top.   It's not cheap to eat here, however it's worth every single penny! If you sign up to their mailing list they often send out BOGO offers on entrees! :) Give it a try! If you're a newbie like us, don't be intimidated. They are all very sweet and helpful.   The serves wasn't the BEST but there happened to be 2 large parties of 8 people each. So we cut them some slack ;)",

This is far superior to any other Indian restaurant and I've tried many. The difference, for me, was the quality. I'm pretty picky and my girlfriend is as well. She's not too big on Indian food.  Well, after taking one bite of Dhaba's tikki masala she was in the culinary pleasure zone. At the end of the meal she said it was her favorite restaurant in Arizona.   You can taste the freshness of everything. Meat, rice, naan. All the food was cooked to perfection and the flavor profiles were outstanding.   Service is a 5/5. Prices are completely fair, especially given the quality.   Try it.",

I started with an appetizer, the pappri chaat which gave me such a hard time eating it all, that I could not even finish half the plate and decided to leave. Not a good experience.

The Dhaba is a classy, affordable, and romantic venue. This is definitely one of the top Indian restaurants in Tempe and is about as good as it gets anywhere.   The service is fantastic, when we arrived the host greeted us and seated us at a table while setting down a few roses. I felt extremely welcomed by the restaurant host anywhere, and from the get-go I knew that this was going to be a great experience.  As for the food, it was delicious. I had the chicken tika masala (I tend to order the plainest items at ethnic restaurants) and it was cooked to perfection. The waitress was very attentive and made sure that we were completely satisfied with our order.   Just make sure to make reservations, as this place is quick to fill up at dinner.",

    "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, I have found my new favorite Indian food restaurant. Groupon had a deal and we snatched it up as we've been in search of trying new places.   We arrived about an hour before they were closed and it was almost empty. They still asked if we made a reservation (we did) -- so it seems like that may be a requirement for later dining during the week. Their table settings are unusual and fit perfectly with the ambiance. The tin water glasses keep your water cold throughout your meal.  I searched the large menu for starters that weren't deep fried and were vegetarian-friendly, but we settled on the paneer fritters. They came with curried garbanzo beans that had the perfect amount of spice. This cheese is amazing, you guys.  For my entree, I decided to go with the vegetarian thali plate. It came with a large salad (the veggies on this were great, but the iceberg lettuce was not the best choice and it had a bit too much dressing), a curried vegetable (PERFECTION), a lentil and bean side (divine), yogurt side (perfect for cooling down the spice), large portion of colorful rice, 3 pieces of naan, a dessert (the BEST rice pudding with mango swirl) and a chai. The menu clearly states that you cannot share the thali, which I thought was hilarious because it's SO HUGE. No, seriously, I had leftovers for 2 more meals after this.  My boyfriend ordered a taro dish which they mentioned to us was 'dry' - no sauce. It tasted a lot like a potato and it wasn't my favorite -- I LOVE the sauces and spices the most - but he enjoyed it.   Our bill was $47 for an appetizer, a large vegetarian thali dinner plate ($14), the taro dish and 2 of their Indian beers ($5 each). I'm a fan! Only one star off because unless you order the large vegetarian plate, all the other options are a bit pricey. I can't imagine that this place does a lunch buffet but I may be wrong.",

We did mention the same to the owner but she denied it blatantly. Additionally they added some awful color which is not even added to a lahsuni kabab.  The Punjabi chole was not at all made with Punjabi spices. Moreover the chole was not properly boiled.  Everything seemed to be stale, heated and brought. over. The only thing edible enough was biryani.",

As always , called ahead of time and made the reservation . The lady who seated us didn't bother to greet us ( because we are Indians and thats a norm here . They don't care about Indians ) . We ordered the food and waited for 15 mins and voila , in came one of the entrees which was super salty and the Phulkas were cold . It took them almost 15 mins to redo the entree and we were almost done with our lunch by then . A forgettable experience . paid over 66$+ for 3 Entree , 3 phulkas and 1 Naan ( worth it ? Not so much )  Pros :  - Authentic Indian cuisine   - Nice cozy place  Cons : - Customer service - $$$$ ( They recently increased the prices ) . - Quality   Lastly , if you don't have a reservation , don't bother going to this place .",

    "text": "After searching the entire valley for quality indian food, we finally found The Dhaba. It's a very authentic restaurant, market & clothing store which carries everything you could ever want from India, I even went home with some henna & bindis. At the restaurant, we happened to have a living social coupon so we made reservations & glad we did because we arrived at 5:30 on a Wednesday night, & by 6pm the restaurant was already at max capacity. I strongly recommend reservations because the restaurant itself is quaint and cozy. The interior was warm & inviting & the serving dishes/utensils added a nice touch to the experience. All of the art was culturally themed, & I enjoyed myself just looking around. The jolly rickshaws by the front door are especially charming.  We ordered the garlic naan, which was incredibly tasty, warm & fresh! I couldn't get enough of it! I ordered the Korma Chicken (spice level 8) and it was cooked to perfection! My rice was also perfectly cooked & my boyfriend cleaned his plate which had been the chicken tikka masala. Everything is spiced perfectly, & since I LOVE very spicy food, I asked for an 8 on their 1-10 spicy scale. I could have gotten it hotter, but being that this was my first visit I played it safe. If you are not very tolerant of spiciness, then I recommend a 1-3. My boyfriend enjoyed his masala at a 6. The food was absolutely wonderful! Portion sizes are just right and the pricing is to be expected with such high quality ingredients.  Out service was a tad slow, but since we saw with our own eyes just how quickly this place fills up, I'll cut her a break. They do put a lot of effort into making you feel welcomed, even down to the place settings. All of the extra details take some time, but if you're in a hurry, just order take out! Which seemed to be very popular as well! There were at least 6 to-go orders fulfilled just while we were there.  If you enjoy Indian food, come to the Dhaba. If you are vegetarian, come to the Dhaba. If you love spicy food, come to the Dhaba!",

    "text": "Finding good Indian food in Phoenix seems to be very difficult. We tried this place for dinner. The only semi good dish was the Tandoori chicken. The eggplant bharta had water in it. The biryiani was some south Indian rice concoction, the achari potatoes and tadka dal were insipid. We asked for mild spice level but that should not affect the taste of food. The good reviews are from people who have never tried real  Indian food and it is apparent that people who are used to real Indian cooking are not impressed at all.",

    "text": "First off the food is fantastic and soo delicious. However, they fall short on a few areas I'm not happy with. First, with all the spices they are cooking with, they have extremely poor air circulation hence you smelling like what you and the restaurant order by the time you walk out. And that scent is so strong that I couldn't even cover it with perfume and I always put my hair up prior entering knowing I'd smell after! Secondly, they skimped me on the rice. I usually go in by myself and order one entree, that's fine. BUT! I was really hungry one day and ordered two entrees to myself both were supposed to come with white rice. They came out with both entrees and the SAME amount of rice as when I usually order one entree with rice. When asked they said I could pay extra which I found inconsiderate because I ordered a SECOND dish that is supposed to come with its own side of rice. They generally serve the rice in one bowl, which is fine, but they did not put any more rice in that rice bowl than they did when I came and ordered one entree! I was extremely disappointed when I left that day. I had to go to trader joes to buy some extra naan for the second entree... :( I also cannot say the two women always working there were the nicest or most hospitable of servers.",

For God's sake, its way too pricey. One appetizer, one entree ,one naan and one kulcha and the price was $40. We ordered chicken seekh kebab as appetizer and we got 6 finger length pieces for $13. We had a chicken curry as entree which cost us $15 but had only 2 proper sized chicken pieces and the rest were broken chunks in the gravy. The paneer kulcha was bland. They even took a 18% gratuity and that too for a takeout. I have had some good Indian food in other restaurants but none were as pricey as this was and will surely not recommend to others nor come back to this place again.",

    "text": "I went here last night with a party of 4.  The place was pretty busy for 7pm on a Wednesday night so luckily I made a reservation and we were seated promptly.  The service was very friendly and helpful but pretty unattentive.  This was probably because there were way to many tables with way too many people and not enough waiters/waitresses/servers.  There were only 3 people  plus the cook(s) doing everything and they were clearly overwhelmed.  The other thing I didn't like was the menu.  It had far too many choices.  There were probably 200+ dishes on the thing.  So we basically gave up and everyone ordered a different kind of dish so we could all share.  We ended up getting a chicken dish, a shrimp dish, a vegetarian dish, and some sort of meat sampler thing.  We also ordered an appetizer sampler thing, some rice and some naan.  Everything was very good and full of unique flavors.  I've never been to India and have only eaten Indian food 3 other times, but I thought the food here was very good.  The only problem with it was the price.  It was ridiculously priced for what you get.  The actual portion size is actually pretty good, but charging $15 for 5 shrimp or 5 pieces of lamb is ridiculous.  It is even more ridiculous because nothing comes with sides.  Everything is a la carte.  My wife got some kind of meat sampler (which came out a full 10 minutes before the rest of our meals) and it was laughable that it was $20.   Anyway, this place pretty much robs you.  Luckily we had a certificate from Local Dines - <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FdfR4eQ&s=74666453fa5eb2cd84c02c6801a501dcfbd893c7f5f3b7db84551161c61ab246\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/dfR4eQ</a> - which lessened the blow a bit but I was still pissed.  So, if you must go, get the certificate and you'll be glad you did.",

No, you can thank Groupon and the fact that we didn't get a baby sitter, and, did I mention, my wife also loves this place.  What about grandma you ask?  Does she love this place?  Who knows, she's coming anyway.  The menu now indicates such things as gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan for each item.  That's good because I avoid those categories like cooked carrots and water chestnuts.  Orders are served on an arrangement of copper bowls.  The chicken vindaloo is actually a little spicy. Seating is limited, so a reservation is recommended.  I'll see you at The Dhaba.  I just feel cool saying the name. . . to myself as I finish typing this review.",

In the past, I would have always rated them 5-star.  Last night's visit was different. The food, drinks, and Asian lady who runs the place were very enjoyable as always, however, aside from those elements, improvement was needed.    Firstly, we had to wait for everything.  There was no one up front to greet us for quite some time, so we had to wait to be seated.  Then we had to wait for water and menus.  Next came the long wait for drinks. We did NOT have to wait long for the food, but the waiting kicked-in again when we had to wait for the bill and wait again to have it processed.  By far the most irritating event of the evening is when some old Indian guy upfront (who we have never seen there before) took it upon himself, not only to take forever to work up  the bill, but to add a 20% tip on top of the food, drink and tax charge.  Now there were just four of us dining -- my husband and two kids -- not a large, noisy, demanding party by any means.  He literally added a line with a dollar amount that amounted to 20% of the total bill. To add insult to injury, he also left the \"tip\" line BLANK, in hopes that I would add even more!!!!!  I wrote \"INCLUDED\" on the tip line, along with a \"nice try\" comment.  I definitely would have tipped our nice Asian lady 20%, as we always do, but I resent that some old guy had the audacity to do it for me.  It takes us 30 minutes to drive there from our home, and this last experience will make it questionable if we do so again this year.",

I'm not sure if it's more expensive due to cooking style & time (their food is noticeably better) or if it could be cheaper. I will eventually check out other places to compare but it may take awhile to move on :).",

We'll anyway, the point I was making (yes, the point!) is that so far, The Dhaba is the best of the best.  Perhaps the most expensive too but like they say, you commonly get what you pay for.   4 stars not 5 because I have been to London and the Indian food there is just off the chain!  If this was rated in comparison to all of London the folks at The Dhaba would not be happy with me as there would be one less star.  However, in all fairness... Best of Phoenix!  Thank you guys!",

Since we had reservations, my party of four were seated immediately at a table with really cool silverware and plates, plus the best \"goblet\" I've ever drunk water from! As the dinner progressed, Mark H. commented that those goblets didn't sweat. Sure enough, the goblet was keeping my water chilled but wasn't sweating. Cool!   The hostess and waitress were incredibly attentive, and we also had the opportunity to talk with the owners! Take time to read some of the information about how civic-minded these owners are (on the left wall when you walk in). They truly support the local community.   The food? I'm not sure what we ordered, as I let my hubby take care of the ordering (since the national dish where he hails from is Tikki Masala). The food, however, all tasted yummy. You must have the garlic naan though to go with whatever dish you order, and top your meal off with the Chai tea (best ever).   Great place! I'll be back, as I'd like to visit their grocery store next door and experience more of their tasty dishes.",

Moreover, the service was exceptionally polite and attentive.   We've only been here once (so far) but can highly recommend the Chicken Murgh Seekh Kabob & the Shrimp Jhinga Tandori.  Just Beware: the dishes & prices can add up fast. Even so, well worth it!  We rarely hand out 5 stars, but feel The Dhaba fully deserves it!",

You're better off going to Curry Corner, Nandini or Udupi Cafe for similar quality but fairer prices.   The service is a hit-or-miss. I've only had one server be courteous and vigilant in taking orders, filling water glasses, etc. The other 3 times I've visited the servers were negligent and not friendly.   Last straw for me was ordering from there on Uber Eats. We got a tandoori khazana dinner platter, which we wrongly assumed would include rice and bread for the crazy price of $20. Not only was there no rice or bread, but the portion was unbelievably small. TOTAL rip-off.   I suggest taking your business elsewhere that will give you bigger quantities of food for a much more reasonable price.",

I wanted an order to-go, and inquired about getting a lunch special (No buffet, but they do have some great looking daily lunch specials). Unfortunately, they will only give you the lunch deals if you eat in, so I browsed through the extensive regular menu. The prices seemed a little high compared to other Indian restaurants in Tempe. I decided on The Dhaba signature saag (Spinach) dish ($12).   There is a cute little waiting area where you can wait for your food to be made. Service was exceptional, especially since it was to-go! The friendly hostess at the counter offered me some water while I waited, and even offered to refresh the cup with more water for my trip back home. The order came in a nice little brown shopping bag with handles, the kind you would find at higher-end restaurants.  When I opened up the bag, I had a really large portion of saag and basmati rice. The saag had a nice balance of flavors and textures. I could taste fresh ginger, some creaminess, and the delicate flavor of the spinach. I had asked for it medium spicy, and it was about right- not too spicy, not too mild. The basmati rice was cooked well, had some vibrantly colored grains and was fragrant from the addition of spices such as cardamom and cumin.  Overall, it was a pleasant meal, and I have more than enough leftovers for a few more meals. I'd love to dine in another time to try out more dishes, and their lunch!",

They were out of the first wine we ordered and I THINK they went next door to a liquor store to buy the 2nd bottle we ordered. We watched them turn away 2-3 tables around 7:00 saying that were booked up then there were 3-4 empty tables the rest of the night.  Good thing we had a reservation.  Despite all that, I would highly recommend this place for the food alone. But make a reservation, thru OpenTable to be sure you get a table, no matter how busy it may be.",

    "text": "My date surprised me by bringing me here for Valentines Day dinner with a reservation. We were promptly seated but it took a while for someone to come around to get us drinks / take our order. They had a special on this day: for $60 per couple, they offered 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert along with naan, rice, wine and chai. We decided to go for that and selected chicken pakoras for the appetizer, chicken tikka masala and vegetable korma for the entrees, and mango kulfi for dessert.  While we waited for our appetizers, we were brought papadums with tamarind chutney, green chutney, and a very spicy red chutney. All three chutneys were significantly different from each other and absolutely delicious. We were off to a great start as the chicken pakoras arrived not much later. I personally thought they weren't all that impressive, just pieces of lightly seasoned chicken, fried but they did taste okay with the chutneys.  I will say considering how good the chutneys were, I'd be interested in trying the samosa chaat at this restaurant.  Next, the chicken tikka masala & vegetable korma, rice and naan all took much longer to come out; at that point, we were really hungry and anxious to get started on eating. I had ordered the entrees at medium spiciness and when I took the first few bites of both dishes, I knew this wasn't a very wise decision. Their medium would be what I would consider hot since my mouth was instantaneously on fire. Being able to just barely dip the naan and rice in the curries was a big letdown. I did order some raita to go with my meal after I made sure that they don't put diced chilies in it like some restaurants do. That helped a bit but again, it was not so great that I wasn't able to fully enjoy my meal. Also, I thought it was absurd to be charged $4 for a small bowl of raita. Also a comment about the naan: the first one we got was a little bit burnt on the top and it was made really flat and crunchy instead of soft and fluffy. The second one was a little bit better but still, I think it could have been better.  Lastly, we were brought out dessert with the chai. The chai was good but again the kulfi wasn't impressive at all. It didn't have any kind of mango taste and almost just tasted like ice. We had gotten some chocolate wine as well as part of the special. I'm not sure exactly what it was but we thought it basically just tasted like Bailey's.  I will say that if we return, we would most likely not do any specials. We felt that we could've done with skipping the appetizers (unless trying the chaat) and dessert. Instead, we would probably order two entrees with two naans and rice. I think that would've been the perfect portion for our dinner on this night and would've cost us half the amount of money.",

The spices don't burn, but they do linger for a bit. I can't pronounce what I ordered, but it involved chicken breast chunks in a heavy sauce with onions and peppers. The dish was good and so was the basmati rice which was included in the price of the entree. Otherwise, it is essential that you of course order the garlic Naan and that lived up to the hype with a light tough of garlic on soft bread. The mango lassi didn't taste too mangoey, but was a nice creamy cool down when things got hot. Check-in on Yelp for a free rice pudding which has some hidden raisins and nuts buried inside. The place is on the outskirts of a shady neighborhood, but as far as Indian food goes, it was a good new experience.",

Pros: - Delicious food, and free rice refills. Two dishes & naan here is enough to fill two people up, with leftovers to take home. - Adjustable spicy levels, for people who want things really hot or really mild. - Fun vibe with pretty good decor. - Sometimes you get a free dessert here if you check in on Yelp!  Cons: - Our water has always been dirty here (it has visible dust and hair in it), which is really gross. - Iffy service. No one comes to check on you after you've gotten your food, and you have to flag people down pretty dramatically if you need something. - They need better seating - when we came here most recently, for my birthday, they stuck us in the back corner, right by the kitchen, and we had to yell over the sound of sorting silverware, clanging pots, etc. Servers bumped into our table and into us multiple times because the table was just too big to be smashed into the corner. - Pricier than its competitors. It's not super expensive, but for this price, I expect better service, and a better overall experience.  Be warned - the spice level is pretty intense. I like hot food, and can handle medium to spicy at most other places, but a 4 (out of 10) is good for me here.  If you don't mind the hit-or-miss experiences here, the food is very good. It's just up to you on whether that's worth the experience and prices.",

They warned us that the food takes a little bit to prepare as everything is made from scratch. After a pleasant wait or food was served. They were thrilled and said they have a new found love for the food. For me I know just how good it is at The Dhaba.

    "text": "WOW! I took my husband here for his birthday dinner after seeing this restaurant featured on PBS' \"Check Please, Arizona\". The Dhaba does not disappoint. I come from an Indian family of very picky eaters and cook Indian food myself at home on a regular basis. We started with a couple of chaat plates - pani puri and the samosa plate. Both were excellent. The samosas were the best I had in a very long time. For dinner my husband ordered the Dhaba chicken curry and I ordered a palak kofta curry that was out of this world. I'm not normally a fan of spinach curries, but this one showed me that I had never had a good spinach curry before. The kofta in this curry was dreamy, made out of nuts, carrots, cauliflower and other goodies.  If you've read my other reviews, I don't hand out five star reviews on a regular basis. In fact, I have a very high standard when it comes to quality and flavor. The Dhaba has it all in addition to very warm and attentive servers. The space is intimate, the tables large and comfortable, and the decor comforting, homey and unpretentious. I believe The Dhaba to be absolutely THE  BEST Indian food in the valley. I am so so happy I tried this restaurant and I will keep coming back for more. There are so many different dishes on the menu that I will be coming here for a very long time!  Do yourselves a favor and go to The Dhaba. Word to those who are averse to hot spicy - dishes are ordered on a scale of 1-10 in terms of heat. I ordered a 7 because I love hot spicy food, my husband ordered a 5. Both had a good level of heat to them, and I was sweating after a few minutes! Love it! If you enjoy hot and spicy food, go for it. If you don't, I would definitely stay under 5. When they say spicy they mean it! You won't find watered down flavors here.",

Everything from the bronze plates, spoons, heavy metal water cups, baskets, added onto the experience. My friend who is from an Indian family actually said that the restaurant served good authentic food, so I'll take her word for it.  My friends and I went as a large group, and was attended and helped frequently. The lunch came with a complementary appetizer with different sauces and something that resembled crackers (refer to picture), and we ordered an additional garlic naan. When we were about to order, there were an overwhelming amounts of different kinds of curry - I appreciated the choices, but it was somewhat hard to decide because I wanted to try it all. People can request for different spice levels - I wouldn't recommend going too high though because the food can be very spicy. I'm awful at eating spicy foods so I ordered the no-spice-at-all curry, which was still great. I had the chicken curry, and my friend had the one with cheese chunks inside. I know that sounds weird, but I think I actually liked her curry better than mine.   Along with our curry, we got large platters of rice with hints of different spices. I wish I could explain it better, but the taste was something that I haven't personally experienced before. Take my word for it though - the food at this place was good.   I will go back to The Dhaba again for sure because I found out that I really do love authentic Indian food, and I'd give more than 5 stars if I could. With amazing setups, great food, kind service, I'll be sure to bring my sister over for a meal!",

This is my go to spot for Chicken Tikka Masala....it's super flavorful and is always good.  I do wish they gave more chicken in the dish,  but it's a good because i usually use the remaining curry for my Basmati rice..mmmm.  The service is fast! I call in my orders and I never have to wait, which is a plus.  My addiction  for Indian curry is quite abnormal...lol, but nonetheless,  i can always count on getting a great meal here.",

There are dozens and dozens of Indian restaurants in the Tempe/Phoenix area. The Dhaba will not be seeing me again, and I will tell everyone this story.

    "text": "My GF loves Indian food, me well not so much as it always seems to upset my stomach...guess I'm not accustomed to all the spices that are used in Indian food. Maybe that was TMI?? Moving on...having just moved to Tempe I wanted to take my gf somewhere to eat and since she loves Indian food I did a search on Yelp.   The Dhaba appeared to be a top Indian spot according to yelpers. I had seen it days before driving by it as it is hard to miss. It hardly looks like a place that would serve Indian food and rather more resembles some quirky old time western place from the outside. I questioned whether it would be good based on this alone. Surprisingly the whole plaza is \"Indian\" in some way. Indian market, Indian restaurant, and an Indian cafe. Wow! I probably would not have come here if it weren't for the exceptional reviews.  Once you walk into the Dhaba, the restaurant is quaint and beautifully decorated. It was busy, yet the atmosphere was quiet. The hostess was attentive and the service was great.   The food was wonderful. Like I said, I'm not a huge fan of Indian food, but I ordered the Chicken Tikka and I loved it. The portions were big, so unless you have a large appetite you'll most likely have leftovers.   The food was a little pricey, but it was worth it. I look forward to going back again...",

    "text": "Aaaah, real Indian and Pakistani food!  I'm a snoot, I'll admit- after leaving Chicago and Devon Avenue, I've always been disappointed by what passes for \"Indian\" out west... but the Dhaba blew me away.   I took some visit family here for dinner last weekend after reading positive reviews on Yelp, and was sooo not disappointed.  First- and I love this, because I'm lazy- you can make your reservation on Yelp.  Literally three clicks and I had a reservation for four at seven.  Sure enough, our table was ready and waiting for us- and I watched several other parties of various sizes show up and wait at least fifteen minutes to be seated, so I was feeling smug before our lhassi was even on the table.    Service is a little patchy (we had to request water twice, and flag down a waitress for our check) but the food is so dang good I don't even care.  Order whatever you want off the amazing, huge menu- it will be good.  I promise.  My relatives had never had Indian before (I know, I don't get it either) so I steered them toward the traditional favorite chicken tikka masala.  We requested it mild and I think our server translated that, correctly, to \"for old white people.\"  The relatives loved it, and I looooved my kafta, and the fact that when you say, \"I want it spicy!\"  the kitchen makes it spicy!      The portions are very generous, which means lots of amazing leftovers to sit in your fridge and get even more spicy depth and flavor over the next day or two.  And the rice pudding- deeelish!  The only thing that I wouldn't rave about was the Masala chai tea, and that's just because I like my chai blend with a little more punch, and this had quite a bit of milk in it.    The ambiance is lovely and perfect for a romantic evening, a place to take your folks when they're visiting and you want to prove you're All Grown Up, or an upscale but not crazy-expensive girls' night out.",

Maybe that's why we are taught to place a napkin on our lap. (Just kidding). But seriously folks, this is a hidden gem of a restaurant and the atmosphere, once we were seated, was warm and inviting. For some reason, the hostess pushes reservations and if you don't have one, you will be told to take a seat and could wait up to 20 minutes, even when tables are open. But don't worry, you'll be seated soon enough and it will have been worth the wait. Service was excellent. Ambiance felt authentic (Never been to a roadside restaurant in India). Try their version of lemonade, delicious. Take your time to peruse the menu and savor every bite. Enjoy.",

Do pay attention to the spice level ratings...I love love hot and spicy food, and have won contests for eating spicy food that I have to sign wavers that I won't sue if it kills the contestants LOL...so I always order the highest spice levels. When they say, a 10 here, they MEAN a 10. It was sooo hot, but that is easily solved by just ordering a lower level. My wife ordered a 5 level, because she likes medium. A six or seven would have been good for me, and she should have ordered a 2. So, mild is a 1, medium is a 2 or 3, hot is a 5, and above 5 is firebrand! LOL I still recommend this place, it's great. :)",

I highly recommend trying one of their entrees prepared in their tandoor oven. The naan bread, both plain and chili infused, was delicious.   However, their service was below average. Granted, they did have a large party dining with them. But there seemed to be only one waitress for the entire dining room. It took about 15 minutes for her to even glance our way and then greet us. Once greeted, she asked if we were ready to order, which of course we were not as we had many questions about the menu. I was given the wrong glass of wine and had to wait even longer for my beverage.   Again, the food was great. And I certainly plan on trying it out again, especially as it's so conveniently located. My recommendation to The Dhaba is to provide the appropriate amount of staff needed to run a successful business, especially when doing a promotional deal for guests, thus increasing traffic.",

    "text": "We (Husband and I) love The Dhaba. Our first two visits were pretty different from each other, so we waited until our third visit to formulate a solid opinion on the place. It's a very thorough four stars for us!  The food is five-star good. It's that simple.  We love the crisp, cumin-laced poppadums (spelled many ways once translated to English: pappadams, papadums, etc.) they serve while you wait for your order and the choice of three sauces. Husband dips with the chili sauce; I mix the sweet tamarind sauce and the chili sauce.  Their chicken tikka masala contains very tender chicken, and consistently has a nice spice blend, level of cilantro, and velvety texture. We find it sometimes has a little less chicken in it than the chicken makhani (makhani murgh), and Husband isn't a sauce guy, but he orders it every time anyway.  The murgh makhani (often translated as butter chicken) is tied for the best I've ever had. The sauce is a rich, as the name would suggest, blend of butter, pureed tomato, and cream, and it is studded with plump golden sultanas (NOT RAISINS, GUYS--these are not hard, chewy blobs) and cashews. The chicken has its trademark bright red skin and is so, so, so tender. Seriously. So tender.  Their mango lassis are the best I've ever had, and I've had Indian all over the place--NYC, London... they are thick, fruity, and perfectly sweet, which means not overly sweet, not under-sweetened.  The garlic naan is superb; we always order two. They use real minced garlic and it is always a nice balance of crisp and tender. No gummy naan at The Dhaba.  Great gulab jamun, but like most Indian places, they cost quite a bit.  The service is where I quibble--the staff are super nice, and super personable. The kitchen just seems to be slow. Our first visit, we waited a longish time, but not so much that we noticed anything out of the ordinary. On our second visit, we waited a full fifty minutes from the time we ordered to the time we received any food--naan included. It all came out together fifty minutes after we ordered it. Eek. There were only a few other patrons in the restaurant at the time, too. The food was still blow-our-minds good, so we decided to give them one more chance, and we're glad we did, because the wait was very reasonable our third time, and the staff especially attentive. (AND they brought the naan out for us to graze on while we waited--perfect.)  In short--eat at The Dhaba. The food is outstanding, the wait time is tolerable, and the staff are kind.",

Let me then thank the abundance of Yelp employees I know who brought Yelp Deals into my life and thus brought The Dhaba into my life. \"The Dhaba,\" just like every item on your menu, I have no idea what you mean. I can only assume it translates into \"super delicious,\" \"super freaken delicious,\" \"slice of god,\" or purely \"pure exctacy.\"   I don't eat Indian food that often, I'm not sure why, but maybe its because I'm a moron. After dining at The Dhaba, I not only want to make Indian food a part of my life, I think I now want to marry an Indian woman, who will cook Indian food for me for the rest of my days on this plante. I will take care of everything else in our lives as long as you make me the standard seven meals a day.  I can't think of anything bad to say about this place. Top of the line food, great service, great decor, and did I mention how much I like the food. I guess the one downfall is that it is in Tempe, which means you have a greater chance of running into ASU types. Besides the repulsion of dining with ASU things, this is a tasty restaurant that I recommend to anyone who is not stunted with the stupid genes.",

    "text": "I had a groupon that I wanted to use. So I ended up going ot the Dhaba last week.   The place itself is a little small. The lady who served us was very kind. But what shocked me was the price of food. Considering that most dishes cost $14 , I would say this place is below the mark for the asking price they have . A normal vegan meal for 2 with 1 drink, 1 starter, 2 dishes came to a whopping $46, which is ridiculous considering the ambience of the place. Being an Indian myself, I can vouch that the food does not taste very authentic. Its a more watered down version of Indian food.  All in all, not worth it.",

    "text": "We absolutely loved The Dhaba.  From the moment we walked in, we knew we were in for a treat.  It's a quaint little restaurant in the Indian Plaza, and the place settings were what really caught my attention.  Now here's a little breakdown of my rating:  - Service.  Extremely friendly, family oriented and always knew when to come to the table.  Drinks were refilled accordingly, and the owner is so darn nice.  She gave great suggestions and even brought out a surprise dessert for my fiance's birthday.    - Food.  We ordered:  Udta Panchi - chicken wings marinated in Dhaba spices and baked in a clay oven.  Absolutely delicious and extremely moist!    Garlic and Khasta Keema Naan (minced lamb stuffed naan).  The textures were wonderful.  Lightly crispy on the outside and delectably soft and chewy on the inside.  The chutneys were delicious as well.  Chicken Tikka Masala - of course a signature dish of most Indian restaurants.  It was flavorful and had great body.  Smothered this on rice and scooped it up with the naans, and you've got yourself one killer meal!  Sikandri Jhinga Saag (shrimp and spinach with herbs and spices - almost like an Indian creamed spinach - just no cream) - light and flavorful and accompanied the other dishes quite well.  Great with the naan and a little bit of chutney.  The only reason I wouldn't rate this restaurant 5 stars is because I would actually like to experience the consistency of their service and food quality.  There are many fantastic Indian restaurants I've been to, and although I loved Dhaba - it still comes in a close second to another Indian restaurant that I enjoy going to out here in Vegas.    But I'll tell you what - Dhaba was unforgettable. My fiance and I still talk about our meal, so maybe they do deserve that extra star.  ;)",

    "text": "The Dhaba is my favorite Indian restaurant in the Valley. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the service can be a bit slow at times.  I love the decor and the ambiance. It's a small restaurant but it's beautifully decorated. It's much nicer in the inside than it looks on the outside.  I read quite a few people complain about the prices. I've always thought their prices were a tad bit high, until this last visit, when I noticed on the dinner menu 3 \"full meal experience\" choices. I got the vegetarian version for $12. It came with a salad (delicious!), a generous helping of naan (their naan is incredible!), daal (lentil stew), rice, yogurt, and the main course, which was a garbanzo bean dish. The final course was rice pudding and chai tea. I was full and happy for $12! My boyfriend got the lamb and chicken option, which was $17, but still a good deal for the amount of food he got. We both thoroughly enjoyed the \"full meal experience\" and would order them again.   They also have a new rewards card for repeat customers, which is great.",

    "text": "Eating at The Dhaba was my first Indian food experience, and I will say I was pleasantly surprised. I tried their chicken tikka masala, the chicken curry, the biryani and some tandoori chicken. I ordered spice level 5. It was perfect, not too hot but enough to leave a slight burn on my tastebuds. The tikka masala tastes like a buttery, creamy tomato soup. The chicken curry was perfectly done, the chicken falling apart and moist. The naan tasted fresh baked and you could taste the salt and garlic on the garlic naan. It was so good, the naan was probably the best part. I also got a dish of some yogurt sauce which was nice and cooled down some of the heat, and a bowl of lentils to dip stuff in and it was very tasty too. We also got a thin, papery tortilla type bread with some little cups of sauces to dip it in, sort of like an indian tortilla, and this was a very nice touch and very authentic as I've never had anything like it. The biryani was a large helping and I kept find myself wanting to take more bites even as I became more and more full, it was just very flavorful and the foreign tastes to it was very pleasant. If there was anything that was something I could complain about, it was the chicken tandoori, which was hunks of chicken breast with a yogurt and spice dressing, but really it was just a dry sort of chicken breast with some spicy flavoring. Still, it was cooked through if not a little dry, but I get the impression there is supposed to be something more to it than just cooked sliced chicken breast with some marinade. The server was nice, prompt with drinks, and because the restaurant was very small we got consistent attention and it was not hard to ask a passing server for a drink refill or more rice. The basmati rice was also very flavorful and helped offset some of the heat from the sauces. We also got the rice pudding dessert which tasted very much like rice pudding, but I am also not a big rice pudding fan or a dessert person. Overall, I enjoyed it so much the next day I was craving it! It really was that good. It is not in the best location ever and the building is a little drab, but otherwise really worth going. To the people saying this place does not have good indian food, well, I am not an expert in Indian food, but I will say I tried another Indian place near me a few days later because I really wanted some yummy chicken masala but didnt want to drive to tempe and guess what, it really was not anywhere near The Dhaba. If you get a chance to go I would recommend it. Others are saying it was very expensive? But, compared to other places I really don't think it is. You can easily spend anywhere from 10 and up a person at most mainstream restaurants, and this place was no different but the food sure did taste great.   Tip: go early because as other reviewers have said if you show up late they will turn you down, they close promptly at 9:00pm and finish seating earlier than that.",

Cute atmosphere located within an all Indian plaza, we ordered the chicken tikka masala, dal, aloo gobi (cauliflower potato), naan, rice, and samosa for starters.    Chicken tikka was delicious though very  few chunks of chicken - maybe it comes that way or maybe that's why they wanted to know from the get go we had living social voucher.   Aloo gobi and dal were bland no taste.   Everything's else was good.   Service though not prompt was very friendly.   I would go back again to try their other dishes.",

It's in a nice location, next door is a large Indian market.  The interiors of the Dhaba is very nice with asian-inspired furnishings, mostly dark wood.  It's actually a very intimate place, they serve the drinks/water in a very artistic metal drinking glass.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala, samosa and my favorite, garlic naan.  My friend had mostly vegetarian, the serving size were more than enough for two people.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  It's really a must try for those visiting Phoenix/Tempe area and so I give it 5 stars.",

The woman who manages could not be nicer and the gentleman who works the shop next door (and who I suspect is the owner) is always making sure that we had a superb dinner.   We do enjoy trying different Indian restaurants in town, but we still count The Dhaba as the standard by which all others are to be measured.  I wish these folks the very best. Even good restaurants come and go in this economy and I want The Dhaba to be around for a long, long time.",

We were so happy that we waited.  The food was absolutely delicious, so much flavor.  The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because once we ordered, we never saw our waitress again & we had to ask the bus boy for more water & he even took our dessert order.",

We tried two appetizers with the assortment of sauces that they serve, excellent. We also ordered 3 entrees and all was served family style with rice. They were out of something that I wanted to try which was ok because what they told us we could substitute was a dish that we ended up really liking. The owner also came over and comped the appetizer that he brought out as an apology which wasn't even necessary but very nice.   We have food allergies and everything on the menu was clearly marked for gluten free, vegetarian and vegan using little symbols before each item. Sometimes I am hesitant to eat out because I'm afraid of them putting gluten or dairy in my food or my daughter's but we did not have any problems with this meal. Also, my 6 year old who is not the most adventurous eater actually enjoyed the meal too and tried everything, which was a relief. The Gobi Pakore appetizer was one of our favorites, simple but now I'm craving it again today.  All of the food was very fresh and home-cooked. We will be back.",

I love that there are bits and pieces of coconut flesh.  We got 2 huge samosas for our appetizer.  It's filled with curried potatoes and peas and came with a condiment of garbanzo beans.  \"It's spicy!!!\", darn, I didn't even think to ask  the level of heat in those suckers.  So, be warned if your kiddos are sensitive to chili heat.  He enjoyed the garlic naan bread he dipped in a sweet and tangy tamarind sauce.  My hubby luvvy the Chicken Tikka Massala served with saffron rice.  I chose the creamy Spinach Paneer.  So good!  They all came in a copper and stainless steel vessel.  The drinks are also served in the same ware.  If you want, you can buy these at the grocery store next door.  The owner saw that my son didn't eat his food offered him mango juice.  Just for that, this place is on top of my list.  The rest of the service was wonderful.  One of the best Indian resturants we've been to.  We can't wait to try their tandoori dishes on our next visit!",
