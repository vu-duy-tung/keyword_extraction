    "text": "I was very excited to finally get to try Blanco in Sky Harbor. I love Blanco in Scottsdale and what could be better than getting it to go before you fly? The ambience of the 'sit down' area seemed happening. I was in my flight uniform and sitting in a bar is a simple no no. With that, I grabbed a cheese quesadilla from the walk up/to go counter. I will say maybe they are still working the kinks out of a new place, with new people, but it was slow. Getting 'to go' should not ever be slow. Nonetheless, nothing out of the ordinary as far as quesadillas go. Other than they put parmesan cheese on top of the quesadilla and I am not quite sure why? Maybe because the quesadilla was placed in a to go box that was labeled, \"Sauce\"?  Who knows, but that made the entire quesadilla taste overwhelmingly, parma! I did love the salsa .. and I am a salsa snob. It can make or break me on a Mexican restaurant. My friend grabbed the chicken burrito. He seemed to like it but nothing special. Hoping that they will work the kinks out and maybe add a few items to the menu other than just quesadillas and burritos. Like how about some tacos?? Nachos?? Because this airport is my base, I will keep checking back and give them some more tries when in the lower A gates.. BUT won't go out of my high A's where the Blue Burrito is. More selection and tastier.",

First off, it was wayyyy to big a tortilla for the amount of eggs in there.  And yes it was just eggs, not eggs and cheese as they had promised (at least I couldn't find the cheese).  Plus the tortilla itself had a wierd sweetness to it and was very greasy.  I ended up just pulling out the eggs and trashing everything else.  Very disappointed, and woud be better off at another place, at least for breakfast.",

    "text": "We were hungry before our flight to Fort Lauderdale so decided to get a couple of breakfast burritos. The burritos looked really good, that was the best part of the experience. The line to order was complete chaos, but hey, it's an airport so I forgive them. However, once we reached the register, the girl who takes the orders, and you know who you are, is the rudest employee I have ever encountered in any restaurant in my entire life. I almost walked away before ordering, which would have been the correct decision, but my family and I were starving and had already waited in line. I ordered two bacon breakfast burritos, and the rude employee yelled to me with attitude that my number is 2! This was also confirmed on my receipt that she gave me, number 2. Now, I waited amidst the chaos for the food to get done (took about 10 minutes), and then the girl yells out number 6! Nobody goes up to the counter, nobody had a number 6. Then she yells out, two bacon breakfast burritos! I went up to the counter and let her know, I think that's mine, but my order is number 2. She shoves the bag of food into my hands, rolls her eyes, and walks away. I was blown away that these people are still in business! I wish I had the girl's name, as I would be happy to pass it along to airport management. She was about 5'5, had black hair, was a thin Mexican, was working on Saturday February 8th at 9:00 a.m on the register at the walk up window. The food was absolutely terrible by the way, it was the worst breakfast burrito I have had in my life hands down. Sonic makes a better breakfast burrito, and I HATE Sonics breakfast burrito. Two burritos, a water and a chocolate milk were $22.68.Save your money!",

I started off with a bloody mary, which is my traditional drink either before or during a flight. They had a 'Hispanic twist' on theirs and I wasn't too big of a fan. Then, I ordered one of their regular classic margaritas. It was pretty good and much bigger than I expected. The food was all from the restaurant next door and was mostly tacos and burritos. I wasn't really in the mood for any of those, so I just ordered a side of chips with guacamole and salsa. They were pretty average - good enough to eat but nothing to write home about. If I am in that terminal again, I will probably eat at Wendy's and then get a drink at this bar.",

Soggy lettuce and barely flavorful dressing. It was by no means a chopped salad. There was lettuce, meat, dressing, and cheese/sour cream (?).   I tried to give my server my credit card when he brought my food to expedite my leaving. He said - I'm going to just leave this right here and placed it on the table. Huh? He then explained the computer system was down. So I asked if he could take cash. He said SURE! So I handed him a $20. He gave it back and said that he had no way to calculate my bill. Seriously? Have you ever heard of a calculator? The prices are in the menu. Ugh So you can't take my credit card and you won't take my cash. What do I do when my flight starts to board?

    "text": "When traveling through PHX I have eaten at Blanco several times. The Mexican Chopped Salad is my favorite. I prefer the lime cilantro vinaigrette over the ranch. It comes piled high with lettuce, black beans, corn, crunchy tortilla strips, scoop of sour cream and guacamole (chicken or steak optional) This trip I ordered chips and salsa, the salad with vinaigrette, no chicken or steak. Salad was a little heavy on the dressing but it was a busy lunch time and I was cutting it close on time so I didn't say anything. When my check came it appears that I was charged for chicken? My $8.75 Salad turned into a $12 Salad... and the only thing I can think of was that meat was accident added to the bill not the Salad. After sitting there for 15-20 minutes waiting for the waitress to come back and risking missing my flight, I took the check to the waitress, paid and ran to my gate, like one of those crazy people in the airport. I was not able to have the bill corrected and now wonder if I've been paying extra on past bills? Hopefully this was just a one time oops.... hate to have it happen to other diners.  Update - The manager reached out to me. We had a great discussion. I really appreciate the concern. Anyone that takes the time and effort to hear out the consumer and make improvements is a wonderful manager. Thanks so much!",

    "text": "TLDR: Skip the guacamole, go straight to the caramel flan. And they're totally cool with laptops!  The menu: Skip the \"must-try\" guacamole. It looks like grocery store guacamole was scooped with an ice-cream scoop, then sprinkled with feta on top. The salsa was fine, but the chips were sooooo salty I had to wash them down with so much water.  Speaking of salty... the Tortilla Soup was the saltiest thing I've tasted in a long time. And it was so thick I think it was more along the lines of a lentil soup than a tortilla soup.  But... there's a silver lining. The Caramel Flan was a-mazing and I would come back for it again. The fruit was a nice balance to the creamy caramely flan.  Service & wifi: Service was pretty good. I know they have to deal with a lot of weird schedules given that it's in an airport, so I appreciated that they accommodated me and my laptop so nicely. The host showed me to a table right beside a power outlet, and made me feel welcome to stay and work as long as I needed. It was 1pm on a weekday, and I think most restaurants would not have been as accommodating. That was a nice plus!",

We didn't get enough chips to eat all the salsa, though, and we didn't bother asking if we could get more.   My BF had a Bloody Mary and said it was pretty good. I had a greyhound. It was good, but I've definitely had better.   I had the fish tacos for an entree. It came with 3 street taco sized tacos and a side of rice and beans. I'm not a big rice fan so I hardly ate that, but the black beans were good.   Service was pretty slow at the beginning. It took over 5 minutes for someone to come to our table and ask if we wanted water. We were ready to order at that point. Once we put in the order, our food came out quickly. Normally I would be really irritated with slow service in the beginning, but it's an airport and it was really crowded.",

Initial service was fine, hostess asked if I'd like to charge a phone while I ate, which is a nice touch for an airport restaurant.   After that, everything went south quickly. Poor server, who was probably handling twice as many tables as she should have been, got my order in correctly, but only ever brought half the food out. Other half never showed up, and trying to fix it I finally had to flag down another server because mine was nowhere to be found. Original server finally brought back the check, telling me it was fixed. It was not fixed. Same mistake as before, same challenge trying to get it fixed again, she's a ghost. Finally the other server brings back a check with the correct total that says it's already been closed.  Really? I never signed a credit card slip, so how's that even possible?   It would have been nice to have even one refill during the TWO HOURS I spent there.  Another table nearby waited thirty minutes to get their order in.   They may have some decent food.  I may never know because the chances of me coming back here are just like the cowboys at a Sedona dude ranch - slim.",

I haven't eaten all day and tacos sounded great. I followed other Yelp recommendations and ordered the machaca tacos on corn tortillas. The plate was vibrant with tacos topped with cabbage, peppers, tomatoes, and cotija cheese; a bowl of black beans; and a white rice with veggies. My first bite was of the rice. It was cooked perfectly. I bit into the tacos--generous meat portions, juicy, and full of flavor. I cleaned my plate. Service was a little slow to start off, but overall my server was really on it. Neat spot to visit it you have some time at the airport.",

    "text": "If I'm diagnosed with diabetes within the next week, I'm pretty sure it's due to my meal at Blanco.    Blanco looks new and chic from the outside with its sexy decor and modern looks.  A gem amongst the fast food chains, this appeared my best airport terminal food option.  Sadly, Burger King or Ronnie would have been far better choices.  I was looking for a safe bet and how can you lose on a chicken burrito ($13) i thought to myself?  I thought wrong.  The burrito was filled with shredded chicken & spices, which looked appealing.  The tortilla was soaked in more grease than any tortilla is meant to absorb.  Soaked to the bone in grease and salt, I took a few bites.  With every bite I took, the salt intake seemed to be exponential, enough to even make me feel nauseous with that much sodium in my stomach.  Seeking relief of the salty chicken grease wrap, I shoveled some black beans and white rice sides into my mouth.  Again, I thought wrong.  The beans were just as damn salty as the chicken.  The white rice let up a little but not by much.  The rice was just as heavily salted, and coated in butter.  Sure, the butter softened the rice and masked a little of the salty taste, but it was not enough of a reprieve from the super massive salt intake.    I was lethargic half way through the meal decided it was best to stop eating anymore right there and stop torturing myself.  I've never felt this sick eating a meal, not even from some of those the MSG laced dishes served up at some Asian restaurants.  I wouldn't recommend the food to my worst enemy, but the beers are reasonably priced for an airport bar, between $5.50 - $8.",

The nachos were made with gross cheese sauce rather than actual cheese and the quesadilla was just not satisfying. Our waiter asked how the food was and we told the truth and he was so accommodating and switched out our food right away. We got the chicken tortilla soup and it was SO much better! He came back to make sure we were happy this time around. He even removed all of the food from the bill. What Great service!! Great margaritas! Will come back again",

I ordered 3 tacos and they were reasonably good - not the best I've ever eaten but good. My wife ordered a burrito bowl and it was almost inedible.  The bottom half of it was submerged in a broth-like liquid so that whatever texture it might have had when prepared was quickly lost. In fact, she left to go find food elsewhere. I would have asked them to remove the burrito bowl from our check but by the time I was able to flag down the server to request our check I was already running short of time. Service in general was friendly but very slow and not enough of it.",

Topped with sliced marinated steak, very tender and delicious. And if you thought that was the last layer of goodness.....it's not. It's then Topped with egg cooked to your preference, fresh pico, creama and avocado which is an add on but so worth it.

If her, I'm fairly sure she isn't connecting the dots to the issue and serving/being a solutions provider for customers hopefully her life experiences will train her better in the future.",

    "text": "I was really pleasantly surprised by my meal here. I had arrived at a gate pretty much directly across the hall, and so I whipped out my phone, checked its Yelp reviews, and decided to give it a try.  The space itself is nice--not nearly as cheesy as most airport bars/restaurants. I liked that you could look into the (clean) kitchen as you sat at the bar. Bar stools were comfy and spaced far enough apart to allow for luggage behind you.  I ended up asking the bartender for her recommendations, and she suggested the Mexican chopped salad, with corn, guacamole, beans, tortilla & Rancho dressing. At just $11 (which included an extra $3 for grilled chicken), I was expecting a pretty measly portion, but it was huge. All the ingredients seemed really fresh and flavorful, and the corn had clearly been grilled. It was pretty delicious. I also had a Four Peaks Kiltlifter beer, which was good.  The bartender (I think her name was Christine) was friendly but not at all intrusive. Even sitting at the bar, it wasn't too noisy or cramped. My salad was out in just a few minutes--definitely much faster than I was expecting (but great for a layover).  It seemed like a steal, especially for airport fare.",

I came in for breakfast around 8am and it was already pretty packed.   The menu was short but had a variety of options. The prices were $8-$14 for options from short ribs, to chorizo burrito to huevos rancheros. Since I was in AZ I had to have the chorizo burrito that came with well seasoned potatoes. I couldn't finish the whole thing and at $9, this is a great option even  without being in an airport!   They also have an extensive drink menu, specifically with tons of tequila options. It was a little too early for that but I definitely would get into trouble here.   My food was ready quick even though almost every table was occupied. I definitely will be back when I fly out of PHX!",

I met SEVERAL people sitting here for about an hour - and they were super fun and made my layover a million times better than so so many more before it. The food was pretty average (mushroom tacos). The service was GREAT. The beer list and wine list were average. The atmosphere was beyond fun. So, to me, it was one of the best places I have been during a layover. I actually feel like it makes me want to fly through Phoenix - just so I can go to this place. I'm sure that there are slower times when this place isn't as fun, and that the fact that the food and booze is average is a little more apparent. But if it's busy, then it's fun.

    "text": "Sometimes life throws you lemons in the form of flight delays. Blanco is a perfect place to make lemonade with it, preferably with vodka!  Located in Terminal 4 of the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, it's on the A gates end of the terminal. Which makes it about a 10-minute trek (faster if you run on the walkalators) from the D gates where we arrived. Even faster if you manage to catch a ride with a skycap (totally worth the experience on its own). If you have a longer layover, do not settle for less!  This place hits all the hallmarks of a good airport restaurant - quick to seat, serve, and get you on your way. In addition, their prices are *extremely* reasonable for an airport restaurant and the food is absolutely delicious!  Absolutely try the carnitas. Among the best I've had, it was moist and very flavorful. I'm not a huge fan of flour tortillas, so I ordered a no-tortilla buritto, expecting it to come out in little piles of ingredients on a plate. The kitchen must've read my mind, though, because it came out as a buritto bowl - the stuff of my naked burrito dreams! The rice was al dente and rich, loaded with butter, I believe. Black beans were tender and well-seasoned. Topped with pico de gallo and a light sprinkling of cojita cheese. Everything in my bowl just worked and I was a happy happy camper. They make a rocking guacamole with roasted poblanos and a really zippy red salsa, served with freshly fried tortilla chips. All this with a lovely Barrio Brewing Co. Tuscon Blonde draft. You won't need that in-flight bag o' pretzels and complimentary beverage.  There are power outlets at the tables and high tops, so you can charge up more than your tummy before your flight. It was busy the whole time we were there but they didn't rush us at all. Can't wait to be stranded at PHX again :)",

Ok so it took about 5 minutes at the bar just to see a menu. I think we came in at changing of the guards because there was no logic to what the servers/bar was doing.   Then when we finically got a menu we are a party of 2 we tried to give him our whole order at once just so we wouldn't have to wait another 5 min just to put in a food order cause come on who has that much time to sit around when their plane is scheduled to arrive. Well our bartender couldn't do 2 drunk order and a food item so he said he would come back. That's after he made our drinks. If he spent less time trying to be fancy pouring and throwing stuff in the trash he prob would have had more time to notice other people who needed service too.   If it wasn't for the fact the good was pretty decent and came out relatively quickly I would have gave it 2 stars. Management should hire people who are more aggressive to make money and have a little bit more personality cause airport restaurants servers have even less time to build a small relationship with guests and all it takes is a little \"welcome hi\" and a smile or a \"I'll be right with you\" I'd rather go to a fast food place and pick up a meal than sit at a bar with an inattentive friendly bartender",

The price was fair, relative to the 'rape' that occurs at every airport when you eat, or drink there.  This place is hip/trendy and the majority of the people coming in appear to be on the young/attractive side (no joke).  I was also happy because they have a few television monitors streaming sports, sorry I'm a guy drinking beer.  The beer selection is not huge, but their tequila selection was fair, 30+.  Nothing too exotic, but all the usual suspects, which worked fine for me.    I found this to be a good social watering hole on my way home.  I enjoyed some good conversation with a few bar patrons, and the service on this day was not too bad.  I look forward to a return visit.",

Definitely a step up from the usual greasy airport choices.  If you are in the mood or afraid to fly, they have an extensive margarita menu. I saw lots of them coming out both by the glass and the pitcher. Prices are a little high, but that's to be expected in an airport. You can do worse.   PS - eat up before your flight.

I had the carnitas burrito minus the pico de gallo (ew tomatoes) and it was phenomenal. The perfect size. The perfect combination and proportion of ingredients. Carnitas that made me want to marry it.   There was a long wait for tables so I ordered my food to go. I put my name in as well but had already eaten because I was starving. I sat at a table ready to crank out some work while waiting for a flight.   Getting into a table with a carry on and a laptop bag is nearly impossible. I don't know why restaurants in airports continue to do this. This is a new restaurant. I really wish they had gotten it right.  When my server arrived, I notified him that I had ordered no more than 20 minutes ago, but that tables weren't available at the time, and that since I was already finished, I'd just like a glass of water.   After 5 minutes he came back with my water and informed me in a very condescending manner that when the wait for tables filled up again, he would have to ask me to leave, because even though I ate while tables were not available,  I was not considered a paying customer.    This is where the stars dropped to three. Why 2 then?  If he was serious, that's bullshit. If he was saying it to clear the table, it's still bullshit. And that's exactly what I did. As soon as I got to a stopping point I got up and left. No one said see you again soon. No one said have a good flight. In fact, I heard him laugh as I walked away.   I'm sorry, but in an airport, you need to be sensitive to why someone is sitting in your restaurant. Sometimes it's because it's the only decent choice. Sometimes it's because they arrived batshit early scared to miss their flight. And sometimes, it's because their flight is delayed a few hours and they don't want to sit on a crappy airport chair. Or there isn't even one of those available.  Most of those scenarios are not good. You have a captive audience. People aren't driving from downtown Phoenix to Sky Harbor to eat at the airport Blanco and go home immediately after. And if I am starving and I order take out because a table is not available but still want to sit, don't be an ass.  I love your food, but the service is enough that I'll go elsewhere next time. It may even drive me to a chain restaurant down the hall.",

The poor gal was doing what she could but it was too much. Not once did he intervene.  When I confronted him on this issue as well as his kitchen staff eating while preparing guest meals -- he proceeded to call airport security on me. I'm the least threatening person possible and I never once used threatening tones or language -- even the security guards laughed at the situation. He was mad that I called him out on his lack of doing his job...  Bottom line, the food is great but if you arrive around lunch time, don't expect the management to manage the situation when and if they get short handed.",

    "text": "This was one of, if not the only restaurant/bar by the gate I flew out of, and I'm glad it was. Blanco was completely packed, which is one reason I was drawn to try it out. Not to mention, the aroma coming from the kitchen was amazing. Since it was just me, it was easy to find a single seat at the bar.  First, service: I was greeted immediately by Douglas, who was all smiles and friendly. Douglas took care of me during my dining stay, and so did the rest of his team. They all kept an eye on the drinks and plates at their bar, conversed with their guests, and truly seemed to enjoy their job and each other. Floor staff (and the manager?) all pitched in to run food to their guests, assuring food arrived hot and fresh. Within 10 seconds of my dish hitting the food counter, it was picked up and dropped off to me.  Drinks: Amazing selection of hard alcohol, especially Tequila, including Sangria and beers. I saw roughly 6-8 beers on tap that ranged in flavors from light and crisp to a little heavier. I myself enjoyed 2 very cold Sam Adams pints.  Food: The menu is pretty basic and not overdone, so I'm assuming they specialize in what they provide. I enjoyed a chipotle shrimp and corn cheese crisp. As Douglas said, the menu is a little hard to understand due to how it's worded. I thought I was ordering a quesadilla (quesadillas and cheese crisps are listed together), but Douglas luckily explained I would be getting something more like a thin crust Mexican pizza. I was not disappointed! The shrimp tasted fresh and not fishy at all. The fire roasted corn mixed with tomatoes, cilantro, and I believe cotija cheese was just what I was hoping for. The size was perfect to share between 2-3 people, or to have as your own, and reasonably priced especially for airport food. I definitely had leftovers. In fact, I paused writing my review so I could finish them. The other items on the menu looked tasty, and what I could smell as it came out made me salivate.  Ambiance: very clean, lighting was calm, bar top and wall decor/tiles were very nice. Nothing overly special, but nice.   Next time I fly out of PHX, I truly hope my flight's gate is near Blanco. If it's not, I just might have to get to the airport earlier so I can enjoy another dish and cold beer.",

    "text": "Absolutely awful. So disappointing for a Fox restaurant. To begin I was waiting in line for someone to take my order and the worker Luis was just counting the drawer, looked like it was the end of his shift he didn't even acknowledge me. Then someone's order came up and he called her, and she asked for lemons. He said they didn't have lemons and she asked if he could check. He gave her attitude and she said nvm it's too much work apparently for you. Then I believe she complained to Isaiah who came over then to help me. I had been waiting for five minutes with no one acknowledging me. Then they came back and began talking to each other about the incident laughing. Finally Isiah took my order which I clearly said no dairy and no meat in my burrito. Then I stepped to the side. Then him and Luis proceeded to bad mouth this customer in Spanish thinking I didn't understand. I speak fluent Spanish. It was terrible, they were joking and Isiah said he told the customer that's just how Luis is, and I really hope that was not what he actually said to the customer. Then when I finally got my burrito I asked Isaiah, no dairy and no meat right? And he said right. I go to bite in it, and it's smothered in cheese. I get extremely sick if I eat diary. I stormed back so upset and asked for a manager. Amanda is who helped me, when they remade the burrito there was no rice or the extra avocado I paid for. My flight was boarding so I couldn't check it at the counter, then she asked Isiah in front of me why he was bad mouthing a customer, and he said he wasn't. I watched him lie to his manager. Then she said he rang it wrong and he said why and he didn't listen on both times when I said no dairy. He said ohhh to Amanda when she confronted him about that part, and didn't even turn to apologize to me. Disappointing experience all around. Honestly think I will call corporate to alert them and to ask for a full refund. I did appreciate Amanda's quickness, but do hope this experience never happens again.",

It's about $3 for a bottle of Coke, which is an expected rip off, but you do get what you're paying for as far as the food goes. Sure, it's more expensive than you'd pay at any hole-in-the-wall taqueria, but considering that I've paid $10 for wilted Caesar salads and ham sandwiches at airports, I'd gladly fork over the same dough for a huge carnitas burrito.   You can sit down and have table service at Blanco, but I recommend just stopping by the quick pick-up counter. Burritos are $4 cheaper there, and you'll get your food much faster - hopefully we've all learned by now not to take a gamble on wait staff when our plane is boarding in less than an hour.   For a great dinner at a reasonable price in the A Gates, check out Blanco. I'll be sure to stop by here again in the future.",

I recently found out it was owned by George Cloony and some others.  Not dissimilar from Cabo Wabo, but pretty good.  I like Repasado (thanks Mula!).  They have it. In an airport.

It's OK that he didn't know the answer to my question. There was a man behind me so I let him order first while I've made up my mind. I finally ordered my Chaudie so burrito (Cheese wasn't melted)  and I asked of the charities it could be well done. I'm only giving them three stars because of the cold burrito and even colder service. I also got a coffee And that was warm -thank goodness. I wasn't offered salsa or a napkin. Or a thank you for your business. Just goes to show you that if you want something you just have to ask for it.  at least I got what I wanted. Solution: have your service people smile say think you answer the questions appellee and don't put the burritos on the cold metal counter - problem solved. Entrainment me and melt the cheese a little bit! Put it on like a Panini press or something. I hate cheese that's not melted",

The mexican salad was delicious and the portion was generous even without an add-on of protein. My husband got the shrimp tacos and gave them a solid 3 out of 5. Our server, Sandra, was so friendly. The place was packed so if you need to catch a plane quickly, you might need to skip it but if you have the time definitely a great spot!!",

    "text": "To summarize up front for those just looking for the nitty gritty: - Speed of service:  5 stars - Employee attitude:  4 stars - Food:  4 stars - Value:  3 stars  I typically time my trips so that I arrive at the airport, cruise through TSA, and get to my gate within just a few minutes of boarding.  But this time I actually arrived at PHX early enough to grab a bite to eat at Blanco.   Admittedly, this has happened a few times in the past and the airport Blanco is a great spot for a breakfast bite and even bloody (for those so inclined).    I had about 40 minutes to spare and ordered the huevos rancheros.  The dish was prepared expediently and delivered, giving me ample time to enjoy while reading the news before heading to my gate.  Honestly, it was delicious and a little more than I needed in the morning.     Of course, airport meals are always expensive, but this was a decent value as far as airport meals go.",

    "text": "For a Mexican restaurant, these guys just do not get it. I asked for nachos and the guy acted like I was speaking Russian to him. Then I asked another waiter to order nachos and requested no nacho cheese sauce (real nachos don't have friggin cheese sauce). When I got my order the cheese was not melted at all so I sent it back. I was then informed that they gave no way of melting the cheese as they do not have a microwave. A microwave??? How about a broiler, or do you not have one of those either? On top of all of this they only have black beans, no refried beans. In the end I gave up and asked the manager for my money back. While it took nearly 15 minutes, I finally got a credit on my card (except the tip). Never again!",

While we got seated fairly quickly, we waited over 15 minutes for service. Server was changed, then took another 10 for new server to bother showing up.   Placed drink orders. Half hour later to be told the ran out of the highly reco'd guac.   Placed meal order, another 20 later, cold food arrives.   Terrible service and no apology for what was an obvious lack of hospitality and any sense of customer service.   Never ever again will I step foot in this place. Still wonder how it's even in business. Just because you've got a captured audience in the airport, please don't take us for granted and showcase such disrespect to or patronage. We have options and will most definitely exercise them.",

So if your ever in PHX and hankering for a good mix of tequila and lime, head on over to A5 next door you will. Find solace in lime juice.    Yum!  Incidentally, I also had the combo fajitas, steak and chicken, both tender and juicy, with great flavor and not too many peppers or onions.  My only criticism would be that they did not have a roster jalapeno on the plate.... But then again I like stupid hot stuff... So.. Your call there.   All in all the best Airport restaurant food I've had in a long time and up there with good/great \"outside\" restaurants.   Giving time I will definitely change terminals to eat here again on my next trip.   Great Job Blanco Taco",

Super flavorful, served in a small iron skillet with small yummy tortillas. I don't even know how to perfectly describe it. I took a photo but super flavorful. Nothing worse than bland ones. These are tops. The Caramelized onions, peppers and spices were full of flavor.  Jeffrey and Doug are amazing super wonderful and attentive bartenders.   I went to another terminal which had my favorite salad but it was way too packed because there was a large flight going to Europe. I got ignored at the cowboy bar boo hoo. But it was super busy.   I came a couple terminals over and this restaurant is amazing. You wouldn't even know you're stuck in an airport. Fun vibe, great servers (and very attentive) plenty of draft beers and delicious food.   A great way to pass some time while you're waiting for your flight, enjoying a good meal and not feeling like you're stuck just having to burn time.",

So I got sat at a high top, crammed between two people. The waiters name is Richard and seemed eager in the beginning. Ordered a drink and it came right out. Then didnt check on me or the people around me for 30min. Over the two hours being here, I only got two beers. I dont know if its worth to stop by here because of the slow service. We are in an airport. Food/Liquor should be served quicker or people will miss their flights. Honestly they have more people dressed to work then are actually working. It took me another 20 minutes to get my check. 2 drinks + a check in 2 hours. Somethings not right.",

Not sure if the music was too loud, but the older waiter who tried to take our order kept getting confused. He was in too much of a rush to listen to what we were saying. Food was brought in a decent time, but we had a hard time getting our ticket to pay. We asked the lady who cleared our table. Then when he gave two other tables their tickets, but didn't even glance our way (waiters know how to keep you from asking for things,) I got up and asked another waiter. Still no ticket. So I went to the bar. Another waiter printed the ticket, and then I had to find someone to pay. It was awful, this is an airport! People need to catch their flights! We didn't plant to leave without paying, but I'm not missing a flight because the waiter has to clean up the drink he spilled on someone (nice touch, but is he going to buy my replacement ticket?)",

Menu was small which i thought was a good thing. 4 or 5 different breakfast burrito options and a few traditional south american options. I got the burrito with chorizo. It was good but not great. the eggs were bland but the chorizo was good. the potatoes were really good. Overall i was pleased with my meal.

But that was a cue to try to make it a better experience. Our waitress refused to write down our order and then fouled it up. My friend ordered a chicken salad and was delivered one. But the waitress oddly argued it was a steak salad, wanted to charge her as such and then said, \"That's OK, I just won't charge you for the steak.\" I went through the same argument about the mythical chicken she was certain was on my salad. Even after I showed her no such chicken was actually on salad. Nonetheless, she reminded me, she would still need to charge me for the chicken. Both of our salads had beans. Per the meal's hidden theme, no beans arrived. When we asked, she reminded us they were out of beans. No such conversation happened -- and there were two diners and one waitress -- so I feel we have reality on our side. When we'd had enough of having her argue with us about our meals, she told me not to worry that I was wrong, she wouldn't charge us. And then called me \"Sweetie.\" If you want to be the trapped monkey in someone else's circus, go sit in her station",

We came in as a party of 4 and three decided to eat a burger next door, however I decided to order off the simple and clean menu.  The chips and guacamole had a subtle flavor that showed depth as it changed. The poblano notes and hint of fresh herbs make this a must try. You can ask for refill of the salsa and chips which we all devoured.  I ordered a trio of three tacos: chicken, machaca and shrimp. The rice was steeped in flavor and reminded me of a less zesty dirty rice. The corn added an amazing texture and one of my table mates ordered a side after trying it.  The plate also came with beans.  The shrimp taco was marinated and one of the best shrimp tacos I have ever had. It was cool and not hot, but the flavor was there and I would order it again.  For desert we tried the flan with fresh berries. The caramel and glazed berries added a refreshing finish to the meal.  Everything was savory and makes this restaurant in the lower numbers of the A terminal of he Phoenix airport a must stop. Charlotte was an amazing server.",

    "text": "I went to this airport restaurant on recommendation from another traveler who frequents the area.  I am always weary of airport restaurants as many of them prey on the 'captive audience' aspect of air travel.  However, this place truly was a treat.  As per usual, I asked the waiter what he recommended and ordered the fish tacos in corn tortillas.  I should mention that the waiter was knowledgeable and understood both the description and taste of every item on the menu.  That, alone, is a huge plus.  When I got the fish tacos, the presentation was colorful and fish was fried very well.  Many fish tacos I have received have fish which appears to be fried whole then chopped.  This fish appeared to be cut then fried which meant each little fish nugget held together very well (if you didn't do this, then great job getting the fish not to completely fall apparent in the taco).  All the components in the taco were well balanced, individually seasoned, and distinct (i.e., it didn't just taste like generic 'fishy meat' in a wrapper).  I don't know when I will be in the area again, but if I have another layover in Phoenix I will be sure to hit up this spot.",

Not impressed, if it hadn't been for Anda taking the initiative and stepping up I would have left. I will never come back...no matter how long I'm delayed in Phx",

The tortilla was fresh, the eggs were fluffy, but the bacon was just a tiny bit too hard.

The chips were freshly fried and hot, the salsa wonderfully made with chipotle, but not very spicy at al.  The guac was smooth and well seasoned..  All in all, I could have just ordered this and a drink and would have considered the meal a success.  Luckily I didn't stop here...  This is a popular/busy spot but with the wait. Since the chips are made fresh, it took a bit for us to receive them, so I was a little concerned about our connecting flight. I informed the waitress that we were in a bit of a hurry.   She, ensured that I steer clear of a couple of items that typically take longer to serve...(The fajitas and, surprisingly, the cheese crisp).  My husband and I each ordered soup and wanted to share a salad, and my kids ordered quesadillas.  We are all happy with our selections, (which is a feat considering our picky, foodie family).  The girls loved their three cheese quesadillas but should have shared one instead of ordering two.  The tortilla soup is a very hearty portion size as well... I couldn't finish it all so took the rest, as well as my shrimp chopped salad, to go.  The soup is cream based with just a hint of heat and is different than the traditional broth based versions I typically have, and love.  I welcome the change...it was delicious!  I also ordered the shrimp chopped salad, which is tangy and slightly spicy, reminiscent of of a civeche...refreshing and delicious.  There are a myriad of of tequilas on the menu and some interesting variations on the traditional margarita.  I typically enjoy a classic, however decided to try the grapefruit pomegranate.  I was not disappointed!  I will order this every chance I get.  I think. from now on, I'll attempt to schedule all West coast connections through Sky Harbour, just to afford me the opportunity to dine here again!",

Now, those that travel a lot know that airport establishments can be a little on the lacking side when it comes to food quality as the need for speedy delivery and production usually results in mediocre offerings.  The reason I like this place is that some of the staple items I like to eat are done well here.  Specifically the Nachos appetizer and the Steak & Egg Fajitas.  Both items are very tasty.  The only downside is that the meat additions to the nachos can be a little salty.  Service is usually good, with no complaints.  Pros: Good offerings so far.  Decent service, especially for an airport environment. Electrical plugs EVERYWHERE, even under the seats.  Cons: Can be noisy and it is hard to carry on a phone conversation here.  If hit at the peak flight arrivals, can be very busy and tight for seating.",

First I was unable to move to a different table. I was sat at a small table with my child and wanted to move to a bigger table and my server told me the section was \"closed.\" The restaurant was completely empty, but whatever I went with it. A bit later the restaurant got completely full and my same server began taking tables in this empty section and she got SO busy she wasn't even able to pay attention to me or the people around me.  Then, I witnessed what was the manager I believe speaking very derogatory towards her employees. Her communication consisted of looking at her phone and rolling her eyes at employees. As someone who has also worked in this environment, I have experienced how challenging it can be to be a server. Your staff shouldn't have to feel disrespected by management. Whoever she is, is running the restaurant terribly and not setting an example at all for her employees! She was an older woman with shoulder length grey hair. Definitely not hospitable at all for someone that is supposed to be working in the hospitality industry. Good luck! Due to this experience I will never go to this location ever again and I will also be telling my friends and family about my unfortunate experience.",

The service at the bar was excellent (Twilight was my bartender) despite how incredibly busy they were ( packed house). The one thing they need is better music.  Sounds like background music at the underwear section of Macy's. Please change your music.",

She was showing a lot of attitude even as we placed our order. She brought out the guacamole herself, and said the nachos would follow. 5 minutes later we were still waiting for the nachos. The manager was passing by, and he noticed that we were trying to grab her attention; and he helped us himself. This repeated later as well.",

She the started acting like a complete bitch and insisted I had to order something or leave. I ordered a glass of water and she said something about only making four dollars an hour... Tough shit bitch, if you have it so bad try joining the military and you can see what real suffering looks like. The food was ok but pretty overpriced. Nothing new in a airport.

I was promptly seated and showed where an outlet was under my table, should I need it. Nice! My waitress was SO friendly and helpful and was actually enthusiastic about the food. She also asked if I preferred sweet or not so sweet cocktails and gave me food suggestions. I seriously couldn't believe I was in an airport as she described the marination process of the shrimp.   The drinks were great and the food was actually mighty tasty. The guac was fresh: sprinkled with cotija and cilantro, and the chips house-made. The shrimp chopped salad was bursting with different flavors and a really good-sized portion. I was super-stuffed by the end of the meal. Also, they let me hang out there for three hours and did not once rush me or pressure me to leave. So if you have to eat in the Phoenix airport, go here, seriously. (Terminal 4 - A gates)",

Although the food is overpriced, the atmosphere has a good vibe (@Scottsdale blvd location). Unfortunately, today I stopped by the airport location in terminal 4. Before I could sit and relax on a very busy morning, the hostess with the mostess attitude noticed we had just came from Modern Burger next door. She said a server would be right over. Almost immediately a guy that looked like a derelict came over and asked us if we would  like to order. I explained that we are going to have our sandwich and would be ordering a drink in a minute. He proceeded to tell us to come back when we were ready to order.  I asked him why he was being so hostile at 7:00am with an empty restaurant. He then asked us to leave again. I was shocked. Apparently he has an issue with authority at home and has allowed it to carryover to work.  Needless to say, and after reading other reviews on this location, Blanco will fail miserably.  Upsetting patrons at the airport will surely impact their other locations.  They just lost well over a thousand dollars a year from me and my employer.",

Our server, Jill was absolutely phenomenal when helping us find options that would actually cater towards our vegan lifestyles. Although the food was honestly subpar (which what do you expect when dining at an airport) Jill made our experience exceptional. Thank you so much for your hard and honest work.

I got the Mexican chopped salad and my husband got tacos, which we both thoroughly enjoyed!  I was not really a fan of our waiter... He was in a rush and not friendly at all. Didn't even introduce himself to us, just came up and asked us if we knew what we want.",

    "text": "One of the bigger surprises lately. Good food at an airport with flavor, fresh ingredients and late-ish hours?  Sweet!  Honestly after Yelping I had a couple of other places in mind for our 3 hour layover at Sky Harbor, but once we touched down I was tired, lazy, and not willing to leave my terminal and general gate area.  Blanco it is! The hostess informed us they are serving a limited menu due to the time of night it was, the options were limited to burritos, tacos and quesadillas. I don't get it, because many of the same ingredients go in their other dishes but whatevs. Not my rules.  Guacamole was a must order for me and hub got the salsa. Role reversal happened the minute we sampled these apps, I usually don't care for salsa and thought this one was great, and he usually passes on guac,  but was scooping this one up quite happily so. Both the salsa and guacamole had a hint of spice (roasted poblabos are to thank for that), were very fresh and extremely tasty. No blandness anywhere.  I went with the grilled fish tacos (mahi mahi), 3 all fish - though you can actually mix and match to sample different kinds if you'd like. He went with the carnitas burrito. Both of these dishes are served with a side of black beans (flavorful though slightly salty) and yummy white rice.    The tacos were great, but the burrito is where it's at. Hooooly crap was that burrito good. If nothing else make sure you get the guacamole and the carnitas burrito here - you should not be disappointed.  Yum.",

    "text": "Quick, efficient, and good food before you fly! I'm a big fan of Mexican style breakfast, so I wanted to try Blanco before boarding my flight to CLT. I was quickly seated and given menus, and drink orders were immediately taken. For breakfast, they have a variety of breakfast burritos and other breakfast specials. I got the Macha and Eggs (braised short rib) and my boyfriend got the huevos rancheros. The food came out quickly, which was appreciated being at the airport. The Macha and Eggs were good, the only complaint is that it wasn't really mixed together so you either got a bite of the short rib or the eggs. I ended up just eating it out the burrito with the homemade salsa so I was happy. The huevos rancheros looked incredible, in a skillet, and my boyfriend was pleased. Quickly got the check and we were on our way! Overall, a good pick if you like Mexican and need a bite to eat before your flight.",

They have most of the popular Mexican beers by the bottle, a few craft beers on tap, nine different types of wines and a nice selection of tequilas. Calm down, before everyone gets excited - they also have margaritas, sangria and other signature cocktails!  I ordered a three taco platter, which includes beans and rice. The nice thing here is that you are allowed to mix and match different types of tacos (our server was nice enough to point that out to us).   I went for two carne asada tacos and one chipotle shrimp. I really liked the carne asada, but for me the shrimp tacos tasted amazing. Next time I will order three of these. Or maybe six.  Our server got our drinks orders in quickly and delivered our food pretty fast, despite the fact that it was fairly busy when we were there.   Give Blanco's a try if you want something different than the typical airport fare. Food is amazing, service is great and the people are friendly.",

But if you're like me, killing time during a layover around lunch or dinner time and seeking a quick and decent meal at a reasonable price, this is your place. I got the green chile pork burrito with guac and it satisfied me DEEPLY. It was super convenient to just stop by the little pick-up window, though in the future I'd consider sitting down at the restaurant because the margs looked good. The tortilla was delish and the meat was shockingly high quality, plus I quite liked their rice blend. The burrito itself is a decent size, not stuffed like typical fast food Mexican restaurants but comfortably filling -- I felt full, but I didn't hate myself at the end, you know?? The one thing I would recommend to them is to sell salsa/hot sauce, as that would have enhanced my experience significantly.   In the sphere of the airport, I happily honor this place with a 5/5. In the world, I'd probably put it at a 3.5! But ultimately, I am satisfied.",

The avocado was fresh! Only complaint was that it was pretty small for $6.50. They do compensate it with salsa, so that made up for it. One cool thing is you can split the tacos.

The salsa was fresh tasting, also mild in heat, but needed salt, or garlic, or more onion or something? All around, dip crunch dip...effing delicious.  The margarita was a double, but in no way strong tasting. Smooth and NOT from a mix!   Elaine was just a bubbly ball of sunshine, and recommended the machaca tacos to help my indecision. I wanted shrimp, but I compromised and did a combo...she was right, the machaca was SO MUCH BETTER than the shrimp or mahi!  The mahi was ok, kinda dry...the shrimp was good enough, kinda fishy....the best part of both was the creamy and zesty chipotle crema that I would recommend adding to anything you order! Both were well seasoned and topped with cabbage and pico.  But that short rib taco....LISTEN TO ME! Even if your favorite thing to eat on the face of the earth is shrimp, you will love that salty, tender, succulent little beef taco. Do it. There are no words. The rice was also incredible.   As a note, these tacos are only 3-4 bites each, so don't be afraid to add a bowl of soup or guacamole, you'll eat it all. And the beans were just beans.... wish I'd done double rice, because maybe a belly full of cabbage and beans is cruel for a four hour flight anyway?   After two double margaritas, I may not care!",

    "text": "Upon arrival at the Phoenix airport I had about an hour to spare so I decided to grab a quick bite to eat. With my dietary restrictions there were not too many opions in my terminal so I stopped at Blanco. I waited at the hostess station for quite some time as servers seeme to pass by without acknowledgement. Several of us tried to figure out if we were supposed to seat ourselves, but because I am a frequent traveler, I knew there is typically a sign that indicates that so I said we probably had to wait. After some amount of time, one of the servers came up and seated me.   I ordered a water and the veggie tacos. I couldn't get the rice because it was made with chicken stock so I replaced that with chips and salsa. Everything moved slowly as time to my flight ticked by. Once the food arrived, I was surpised at the portions so I jumped right in with 30 minutes to spare. The tacos didn't really have much flavor other than spicy. I even put some salsa on them and still no flavor. The chips and salsa were good but the most amazing and flavorful item on my plate was the black beans. Delicious. I'm not sure what they put in them but yum, yum. I could have had a meal just with those; however, I had to consider the welfare of others on my upcoming flight and what beans do to us so I ate what little I got and was content with that.   I asked for the check and time again stood steal. Eventually I got it and ran to my gate.",

Someone else brought my food ... he never once came back and I only got one glass of water.  Despite sitting next to the server station... nobody cleared my plates, offered to bring me more water, nada.  They obviously don't help each other out.   I waited a full 30 minutes post finishing salad and water... oh and writing this review before someone actually noticed I was finished and it was a manager.

I ordered the pork tacos, with rice and black beans (no choice in beans at this location.) Rice was mushy and not much better than out of a box.  Flour tacos were small, but were hot and good. The pork had little evidence of green chili flavor, and the pico and lettuce did not add much. The meat was moist but just unexciting. I would return, but definitely choose a different menu item. I was not offered chips and salsa.",

The tortilla was hot, thin, and down right good. Matcha was tender and juicy but just juicy enough so that it's not dripping down your arm while eating it. The eggs were very good too. So I really loved my morning matcha breakfast burrito.   Yes a little overpriced but everything is overpriced at airports. Food good. Service fast.

Here's an idea!! Maybe the people selling the to go food could actually TELL the \"customers\" the \"rules\" so they don't just wander over, sit down, and  then get told they can't sit there - even though they are paying customers and there is tons of open seating. Makes zero sense.   In addition, the host LITERALLY stared at the rear end of EVERY. SINGLE. FEMALE. he seated who was wearing yoga or exercise pants. Honestly. It was gross.",

It was really good and it came out from the kitchen really fast. Due to the speed, it's obviously all pre-made then thrown together upon order. In an airport, where time can be of the essence this is understandable.   After a little bit of research, I learned that Blanco Taco and Tequila is part of the Fox Restaurant Concepts family. I've become fairly acquainted with these Fox restaurants since moving to Phoenix and I have to say I'm a fan.",

Michael took great care of me at the bar.  I went with the classic margarita and it was so good, but needed a kick, so the next one I made it a double.  They didn't charge for a whole additional beverage when making a double, which some places do and it is so uncool.  Also, the chips and salsa came with free refills which really was a nice gesture.  After a bit, I decided to get some tacos and Michael recommend the shrimp/fish tacos.  I wanted both so he let me make it a combo so I could try them both.  Thanks Mike!        I enjoyed both the tacos, but wasn't really thrilled about the tortilla.  Little dry.   The cream was delicious and the meal came with  homemade rice and beans.  Nice touch!           Definitely will stop back by next time I'm layovered in PHX, if for nothing else, some chips and salsa and a refreshing margarita!",

    "text": "Normally I'm not one to write a yelp review unless it was an amazing experience or the complete opposite. Unfortunately, this was one uncomfortable experience. Two big things I want to touch on in this review, the horrible service and the gross thing found in our food.   1. Our waitress, Jodi, seemed to hate her job, and took it out on the people she was serving. My sister and I felt extremely uncomfortable as she hardly spoke to us, and just stared at us like we were unwelcome guests. I've worked in the restaurant industry before, and this is not how you should treat your guests. As she delivered our food, instead of waiting for us to move our belongings out of the way for the plates, she throws them down on our stuff, including my sisters AirPods. She seemed to show no respect for us or any other tables she had. When we were finished with our meal she throws the check down at my sister, without saying a single word. As much as I wanted to leave no tip, I left a few dollars and ran out of the place hoping she wouldn't throw a fit over the small tab.   2. Lastly, as my sister finished her food she found one long curly black hair in her rice. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but that made us regret eating our entire meal. Since we had the worlds most unpleasant waitress, we were afraid to even try to complain about the long hair found in my sisters food. So, unfortunately, we had to pay for the hairy food as the waitress quickly grabbed our plates without asking if we were finished eating yet.   In conclusion, the place was nice but the service was horrendous. Thanks, Jodi, for making one nice lunch the most uncomfortable lunch I've had in a while.",

I had read some of the reviews that mentioned small portions, so I ordered guac and chips and then the green chili pork tacos.   Chips and guac were good...nothing spectacular but decent. The tacos were delicious...and a much larger serving than I expected! There were three tacos, each with a double corn tortilla, and loaded with porky goodness! I completely stuffed myself. I also spent quite some time sitting, drinking, and finishing my chips...and my waitress made sure to check on me often.  Overall I thought it was good food and good service. I don't ever plan to fly through Phoenix again (I mean, 10 hrs, remember???) but I can recommend this place for anyone else who gets stuck there!!!",

I opted for a classic breakfast with 2 over easy eggs, bacon, potatoes, English muffin and an OJ on the side. Overall it was good. Bacon was perfectly crispy, and eggs runny but not overly runny. The potatoes almost tasted like curly fries as the seemed to be fried but were still good. The English muffin was toasted with butter. It was big enough I used half with jelly. Orange juice was a bit bitter but It may have been fresh squeezed. Over all everything was good. The service was great. Although it was pretty busy,  I was right away seated and the waiter was very attentive and friendly that you would forget your at an airport.  For those that dont have time to have a sit down breakfast, they have a to go bar on the side with options of different breakfast burritos.",

Ok not really, but they seem to have forgotten they're in an airport, so cramming tables in with only 14\" of clearance isn't bright considering all the carry-ons, strollers, and random objects people probably could have left at home. Thus, fitting 4 adult males, each with a carry-on and computer bag was pretty comical.  The menu is pretty limited, which is understandable considering it's an airport eatery. The food, however, was less than bueno. Egg and chorizo burrito with \"extras\" (sour cream and avocado) was $18 and thankfully only took up about a third of the plate, because I needed the rest of the plate to catch the grease. The...uh...I think they were potatoes...well...no, just pass on those.  The bright spot, though, was our server. She was so sweet and polite and had solid customer service skills. She made the experience something slightly better than 1-star.",

Anyhow, the food is pretty good at this airport stop and while the beer on tap doesn't quite do it for me, there's a good selection for most people traveling through. The bar staff is always the same here so you see a familiar face when hitting up this airport watering hole. They are pretty great too. Not fake friendly and capable of handling tough situations, if they arise.   One of my favorite things about stopping here for a bite and a drink is that most people are just passing through and most people at the bar are traveling solo. It makes striking up a conversation with a random stranger all the more easy and kind of enjoyable. There's a sort of comfort in knowing the people at the airport bar are just passing through and will be gone from your life as quickly as they came.",

    "text": "After an overnight flight from Hawaii, our group was ready to get out of our seats and explore the Phoenix Airport.  We eventually found our way to the terminal where our gate was located and this place seemed like the most interesting option for breakfast.  Although the place was nearly full, there was a steady turnover of tables, and so within a couple minutes, we were seated.  The breakfast menu here is short and to the point.  After getting our beverages, we ordered our meals which didn't take too long.  My wife got a \"Traditional\" breakfast with eggs (she chose scrambled), English Muffins with butter and jelly, and diced potatoes (not hash browns).  My grandson went for the Steak & Eggs burrito which comes in a skillet.  He liked the eggs and meat, but wasn't expecting the long strips of pepper (they looked more like jalapeno than bell).  It also had sour cream, onion, and a tortilla with pico de gallo.  I enjoyed my Huevos Rancheros which was also a skillet meal.  The base of the diced potatoes kept aloft a somewhat darkened tortilla shell that held the black beans, pico de gallo, ranchero sauce, and the over easy eggs I ordered.  The table knife I was given was a bit on the dull side, so cutting through the potato-supported tortilla shell was challenging, but I made it work.  We were able to get our check with plenty of time to spare and were soon on our way.  The staff was busy, but did manage to keep checking in to see if we needed anything else.  If you are in the area, you can get a hearty and pretty tasty breakfast here.  Review #2407",

The To-Go window has 2, (maybe 3?) food options to pick from:  burrito with varying types of meat and a Quesadilla is all I remember.   I just wanted tacos. 2). Ordering to-go from the bar with the full menu is possible, but it's crowded and difficult to do.  It took a few minutes to get noticed with the crowd. 3). No chips or salsa with the to-go order although I was told it would come with.  Pros: 1.) The food was all very fresh, including the slaw and what tasted like homemade tortillas.   2.). There were (3) street tacos in my order, but they let me choose 3 different types.  I got the shrimp, machata (beef), and green chile pork.  All had excellent flavor and different accompaniments.   3.) They were pretty quick to get me my order.    My total bill was average for an airport meal - about $20 for the tacos, rice, beans and bottle of water.  If/when I come back, I'd give the sit-down restaurant a shot.",

    "text": "I stopped by Blanco Tacos + Tequila during a quick layover at the Phoenix airport. As expected at an airport, the food was on the more expensive side, but my meal was surprisingly good, despite being relatively healthy. I got the Mexican salad with steak (~$17.00 after tax) which came with good proportions of guacamole, grilled corn, and tortilla chips. They did skimp quite a bit on the steak though. Nonetheless, the salad was quite good and served in a generous portion. The waitstaff was also friendly and efficient, a definite bonus at an airport. I would definitely stop by again, next time for a burrito!",

Thank goodness the guacamole was good because they didn't give much salsa and the chicken was a little bland so the guacamole did help in adding flavor.",

    "text": "So I have a 3 hour wait until my flight, its 945pm on a Weds night, I'm hungry, I'm already tired and my expectations are low as I head toward this restaurant that is literally right next to my departure gait. I've read the Yelp reviews. I can see the place is packed and there is a line.  I'm greeted by a smiling hostess who takes my name and instructs me that I will be seated soon. And I was. The next smiling face was my waitress, Jill, who has worked here for 3 years. Would you like a drink? A margarita would be nice. Double? Why certainly,  I'm not driving.  My rule of thumb when I've never eaten in a particular place is to ask my server for a recommendation. Jill said her favorite was the burrito bowl and this turned out to be an excellent choice and the bowl is a real bowl, not an edible taco bowl. The guy next to me got a burrito and said it was quite tastey. It looked good. I also got the chips and salsa that were tastey. You know a chip is good when it can be eaten naked.  Despite the number of people in this place, the service was efficient and fast. They never appeared to rush me while I wrote this review and sipped my drink. Jill checked on me often and even stopped to chat a bit.  I'm giving them 5 stars for doing everything right for me during my meal and serving up decent food and service to the airport crowd. Please keep in mind when you stop in, this is an airport and you are the airport crowd.",

We ordered drinks, guacamole to start and fajitas for our entree. Our water drinks came out after our entree which I was disappointed about.  My margarita was really good and recommend it and order it again. Our fajita was basic and I would try something else next time.

The place was packed but as soon as I was approaching the door a nice waitress started waiting on me.  She asked if I wanted a chair near an outlet to charge any of my devices and took me right to a seat.  I wasnt going to order food but it looked good at the other tables.  As it turned out the home made guac and drinks were great.  The tacos were amazing and you could custom order them to your taste.  So you might be asking why not 5 stars then.  I understand I was also in an airport and everything is usually higher priced but it was even a bit more pricey than I expected.  Still kinda of worth it though.   If my gate is near there I will go back.  But if my gate it a bit away I might look for more of a bargain.  After all, it was just tacos and tequila.    But yum.",

They did recognize that it might be lunch to other people, and offered me the lunch menu as well, which was nice.   My server asked if I wanted sour cream or avocado as well, since the chorizo was spicy. I went with a bit of sour cream. The burrito came out quickly and was served with some very nice fried potatoes as well.   The chorizo was medium hot, just about right, and the burrito was good sized and loaded with eggs and a bit of green onion as well. Very tasty.   I had some time so decided to hang for a bit and they didn't make me feel pressured to leave at all. Nice.   Their beer selection is not great but there are a couple of nice ones in there, as well as a full bar.  This place is worth a visit!  Airport food can suck But stop here for a good time Food and service rock",

It had been a long day and I was ready to fall asleep once I boarded the plane.  However, when I got back home and finally got around to submitting a work expense reimbursement, I realized I had forgotten to grab the itemized receipt from my meal.    I did not see a phone number listed for this particular location, so I reached out via Yelp to see if perhaps they could help me get an itemized receipt.  Jon A. responded within the hour, and within a few minutes of giving him the necessary information to find my transaction I had a copy of my itemized receipt waiting for me in my inbox.   Next time I pass through the Phoenix airport I will be sure to stop by Blanco-Jon certainly did not have to take time out of his day to quickly find my measly $20 receipt, but the fact that he did so in less time than I spent at his restaurant means that he has my business as a repeat customer.  Thank you Jon!",

    "text": "I was very disappointed in Blanco tacos in the Phoenix airport. When we sat at the bar, the bartender and older woman (Mrs. Collins- I only saw her last name) did not even greet us. She placed beverage napkins in front of us and just looked at us waiting for us to order without giving us menus or drink options. We asked for menus and I ordered a margarita (which turned out to be the worst Margarita I've ever had- it was very sour and I watched her pour the tequila...she put a drop of patron and little Jose Cuervo.) She didn't return to get our food order so we had to flag her down and she ordered our food and never checked back. I couldn't drink the margarita because it was so sour and she never came back to check on us so we flagged down another friendly bartender who quickly made a different cocktail and helped change our experience (which is the reason I'm giving 2 stars opposed to 1)",

It wasn't a problem that we only wanted to order chips and salsa and to split a burrito.   The chips and salsa came almost immediately and were everything that they should be - homemade, fresh with a nice zippy salsa. The burrito had a generous portion of chicken with a really nice flavor. The rice tasted like it was made with a lot of butter, good or bad depending how much you like butter.   We are used to overpriced and less than delicious airport food so Blanco was an unexpected and delightful surprise.",

You'd be surprised how many airport restaurants seem to forget that  their customers are actually trying to catch planes. Not to mention the food is usually \"eh\" (Logan Airport Beer Works, I'm looking at you). Here, though,  our sever consistently checked on us and when I ordered the heuvos rancheros  (which were delicious!)  she made sure I knew those took a little longer to cook (which was not a long time at all really). The service was great,  and the food and bloody Maria were too! If you have some extra time to sit in Terminal 4, do yourself a a favor and come to Blanco!",

    "text": "I generally always give 5 stars when needed and only 1 star when also needed.    I walked up to the host and wasn't greeted in a friendly way.  It was more like hey bro, you want a 1 top table?  I said yea, bra I just need a table.  The host then just turned around, mind you there is only 20 tables in about a 25x25 area, then said we just gave the last one up.  I was staring directly at a table to his right that needed to be bussed.  He then said oh you want that 4 top?  I told him i just needed a table,so I can eat and work on my laptop.  I was sat, the menu was placed face down, and he left without saying anything.    It took the server a few minutes to get to me, which wasn't the awkward part.  The awkward part was listening him tell the table across from me that they are almost out of everything and that there kitchen was closing quickly.  When my server came to my table, he didn't introduce himself, nor did he really great me.  It was just \"can I get you a drink\" so I asked for a diet coke.  I then asked him what the kitchen was out of, but by the time I finished my sentence, he had already walked away.  I had to call him back to the table to find out what the kitchen was out of.  I had to ask him what the kitchen was out of, and he really didn't say anything other then beef and maybe chicken.    He came back a few minutes later with a water, which I didn't ask for.  I placed my order and while I was doing it he wasn't writing it down.  After I placed my order he tried to repeat it back to me, but forgot an item so I had to repeat my order. While I was waiting for my food to come, the table was grumbling and looking for a manager.   They couldn't find one, but ask for the check and they had the same waiter as me.  That waiter went to the host stand and started explaining to the host how he wanted the dinning room floor sat as it was to benefit  him the way he explained it to the host.  So about 6 minutes after the table next to me asked for their check he left the host stand and the table had to ask him again for the check.  I got my food in a timely manner for sure, and the girl that dropped it off was friendly.  My food isn't bad, but the queasily is boring nothing special.  My salad was very normal and I will give it an excellent rating for the use of square Doritos chips.   My burrito was good, but the carnitas needed to be cooked longer.   Now I have been done eating for about 10 minutes, and my server never checked in on me to see how my food was, nor has my table been pre-bussed.    1.  You are in an airport, so running out of food isn't a reason to close early. 2.  If you are going to close early get your story straight with your staff.  The would tell one person they had no food, the next guest he would tell it was inventory night.   3.  Why would you stop seating for your dinner menu at 8:45 in the middle of a holiday travel season.   4.  The managers walked around looking like he was shelled shocked and seemed to checked out.    So if this Blanco is owned by a real restaurateur and you have franchised out your brand to the airport, I would pull your contract with the airport.  They are doing your brand extremely poor justice.  I doubt the previous sentence is what is actually going on here.  This airport should really re-think its customer service skills and find a couple of good real restaurant people to get this place into shape.    FYI, now at 25 minutes after finishing my food and my server still has not come back to collect my plates or check in on me.",

A couple of negatives...they wouldn't allow us to substitute potatoes instead of eggs for some reason, and because of the way the burrito was put together, the cheese was on top of the pico de gallo and didn't melt at all. At the end, I ended up just eating the bacon and pico de gallo out of it and throwing away a big chunk of the egg and tortilla. Not worth the price. You can get a breakfast burrito in So Cal that is ten times better for half the price.",

Running on empty after a long day of work, and finally heading back home, I was excited at the possibility of some Mexican food before my flight back to the OC.    Usually I would never order a quesdilla from a Mexican restaurant (the idea being anything I can easily make myself is out of the question), but upon looking at the menu, I was immediately sold.    Melted Oaxaca, Asadero & Manchego Cheeses on a Crisp Flour Tortilla with Machaca?!  $9 for an airport version of this was right up my alley.    The food came out fast, and it was exactly what I hoped it would be. Solid.  4 Stars",

Then may drink order was taken I ordered a skinny margarita I didn't know it came with soda water in it I inquired about it and got the nose up yes that's how it's made. So I ordered something else and I was never offered to take the drink off my bill. During this time the bartenders were again whispering about how the tipping has sucked did it ever occur that it was maybe there attitudes and no customer appreciation? I guess I'm going to be a cheap ass as well at least stop and say hello and engage the customer your not that busy and if you were the tips would be better.",

    "text": "So I guess I do like Mexican food...Blancos was really good!    We stood in their fast food line, called Blancos on the Fly, to pick up quick bites during our layover.  The line almost spilled out into the terminal but it moved quickly.  The menu options at the walkup line were limited to:  Chips & Guacamole  3 Cheese Quesadillas (made of Oaxaca, Asadero and Manchego cheeses with an option to add chicken or machaca beef for an extra $2)  Three burrito options (made with black beans, cilantro rice Mexican cheese and pico) ---Carnitas Burrito (braised pork with tomatillo and green chiles) ---Chicken Burrito (slow roasted chicken with caramelized onion and peppers) ---Machaca Burrito (braised short rib beef with tomato and green onion)  My quesadilla was simple but delicious...loaded with tender chicken and gooey cheeses.  The chicken was slightly spicy and so moist that a dribble of juice ran out when I took a bite.  It was much more flavorful than cardboard quesadillas I've had in the past.  The thing was huge too--cut into four pizza sized slices that barely fit the takeout container.    The boy ordered a fat burrito that was packed with chicken.  I didn't taste it but apparently it was so good that he wouldn't put it down so I could snap a photo.  He did mention that one side of the burrito was cold and the other was warm. Not sure how that could be avoided when you're wrapping cooked foods with fresh ones.  It certainly didn't stop him from demolishing the wrap in record time.  I hesitated to stop at Blancos but I'm glad we did.  Lunch was filling and bursting with flavor.  They make it easy to grab a tasty lunch and still get to your gate on time.",

I do think the service is even worse if your Hispanic, funny from a Mexican food restaurant. Pretty much the staff that interacted w me gave an attitude and didn't care about providing good service, as if I didn't matter. 2 Hispanic at front and one African American waiter and funny thing the Caucasian staff that interacted with me were the ones that provided me good service (one brought the food and the other was a girl waiter, who wasn't my main waiter.)",

On 8/4, my family and I visited early in the morning for a quick breakfast before our 7am flight. It took asking the woman sitting at the cash register if they were even open before she sighed heavily and said yes. She took our order and we sat down at a nearby table and waited. And waited. Finally after about fifteen minutes, my father walked up to ask about our order. He saw three waiting in the window, and the woman looked like she didn't recognize him at all (not surprising considering she didn't even look up at us when we ordered). He asked if the three burritos were ours, and she looked up and finally nodded. Eating the food was an okay experience. My steak and egg was fine, and my mother's bacon and egg was fine, but my dad commented on how the chorizo in his burrito seemed to be cold. But, we didn't have the time to reorder considering how long we'd already been there, so he ate it and we boarded the plane. That night, my father woke up with the chills, and then near-constant vomiting through the night. It laid him up in the hotel room for the entire four days that we were supposed to be on vacation. TLDR; no redeeming factors for this place.",

Not too sweet, not too strong, well balanced and tasty. I wish they used a courser salt on the rim but that's nit picky.   The tacos were full of flavor and the perfect amount of food. Fresh, warm flour tortillas and the carne asada were amazing. The others with me got salads and were singing their praises for the whole flight afterwards.   If you have time - come here!",

Machaca, as I typically have it, is a beef cooked in its delicious juices until it's plenty succulent. This didn't taste like any machaca I had had before, it had almost a chocolatey flavor to it. Not what I was expecting but not bad either. The cheese in the burrito added to the richness.  I'd gladly come back here again",

    "text": "3 stars for the seating/how busy it is really.  I came here over the weekend, waiting for my flight to board to head back to California.  I got here around 9:00AM with my boyfriend and we went to go find where our gate was to board.  We surveyed the area and found somewhere (close) to eat.  It was between this place or another place that served strictly just alcoholic drinks (it's 5:00 somewhere, right? haha!)  So we chose this place, it was pretty crowded but it was only thw two of us so it wasn't that bad.  We were immediately seated  and our server came to our table within seconds.  The seating arrangement was different, maybe because it was a small place but we basically had a chance to choose where we would like to sit.. and we also shared tables with strangers.  My boyfriend got himself a beer, I forgot what it was called but it was a nice amber color.  I got a mixed drink called the Greyhound.  Mine was tasty, but probably not my favorite (I don't like vodka).. it had grapefruit juice so I enjoyed that part at least.  We ordered a steak and egg burrito, which we had to split because our appetites was not big.  Around this tiny restaurant, we had tv all around us to watch.  Fortunately, we are huge sports fans so we enjoyed what was on tv!  Our steak and egg burrito came on two separate plates (instead of bringing an extra empty plate) they already split it for us, which was really nice.  The burrito sizes were pretty good!  Think of a Big Mac burger size.  They also come with a pico de gallo salsa, and home fried potatoes.  The potatoes were a little orange, and because of that I thought they were sweet potato fries.  They weren't, but I'm ok with that.  Overall, the food was pretty good and the service was as good as the food.  A few things I did not like though was the size of the actual place, and because of that... workers with food trays, carts, etc. would have a hard time passing though the restaurant.  I would come here again if I had to leave from the Phoenix Airport and probably order the Huevos Rancheros",

The atmosphere was nice with TVs playing sports everywhere and our waitress was really nice. She even took a special requests from me to remove peppers and add chicken to my dish.  This place really surpassed expectations for an airport bar. It is now up there with that fox sports bar in Charlotte as one of my favorites.",

I was super tempted to order the bloody maria but ended up ordering the nachos and quesadilla instead. I asked if it was possible to add a side of guacamole to the nachos, and they ended up just bringing me the whole guacamole and chips appetizer, so there was a whole lot of chips overload going on with my meal. Prices were OK and I wish there was an add on option instead of having to order an entire appetizer when I just wanted a little guacamole. The guac was OK. It was a little bland. The nachos didn't have the usual melted cheese but the liquid nacho cheese kind that you normally see at Taco Bell or 7-11. All in all it was just an OK meal. The staff was kind and attentive, so extra stars for that.",

First it takes over 10 minutes for a server to even recognize your existence - and this is at a high top with about 15 people sitting at it.  Then your food to comes out before your drink which is scary that they can \"make\" fajitas faster than they can open a corona.   After the food I decided I had some time to kill still and wanted another drink and chips and salsa.  Drink came reasonably quick that time chips and salsa took 17 minutes.  And no they weren't freshly made.  This place deserves to be out of business",

    "text": "So airports are not my favorite places and the food tends to be overpriced. My husband discovered Blanco when he was on a business trip and loved the quesadillas so much he told me we had to try them the next time we went through the Phoenix airport. Now every time we're in this airport we pray for a decent layover just so we can go have the three cheese quesadillas (all Mexican cheeses) and fresh, very tasty margaritas. The service is insanely fast--we got our food about seven minutes after ordering--and the wait staff is kind and attentive. Everything tastes fresh and the price is definitely not bad, especially for \"airport food\" (heck, I'd want to eat here for a date night...it's definitely not your average airport dive). Blanco is a great respite from the grind and pain that airports can be.",

The kids portion is huge and my ordinarily big eaters both left food behind.  One kiddo ordered the cheese quesadilla and so it was super easy to package it up in their to-go container to eat on the plane.  I got the Mexican pizza and that was also huge.  They were fast (35 min from seating to leaving) giving us plenty of time before our departure.  Bottom line:   Recommend for the airport",

    "text": "OK, so I go to airport bars pretty regularly.  In fact, recently at Sky Harbor, I've had to go to a couple of those \"stand up\" bars (where there are only 4 or 5 seats and everyone just stands around).  So, I have come to lower my expectations.  At least at these \"stand up\" bars, you can be served fairly quickly.    This is where my beef begins with Blanco Tacos and Tequila (Spelled wrong on Yelp btw, pretty sure there is only one L in Tequila).  I have 20 minutes before my flight and I would like to get a drink.  Not a lot to ask, right?  Though there are open seats at the bar, we are still required to wait in line.  In fact, give our names and then stand awkwardly outside this poor excuse for an airport bar.  This wouldn't be so bad if I didn't see entire groups of people bypassing this rule and sneaking in and taking large tables when the hostess wasn't paying attention.  After 15 minutes, I finally was offered a seat at a crowded and dirty mutual table.  I asked if I could have one of the open seats at the bar, and the hostess, who didn't seem to care at all, just said \"fine\".  After another few awkward minutes of trying to send smoke signals to one of the three bartenders, I was asked if I wanted a drink.  \"What kind of vodka do you have?\"  \"Well...\"  \"OK, can I get a Kettle One and soda?\"  \"Sure...\"  And she then proceeds to sneak over to what is obviously a bottle of Skyy vodka and pour my drink.  At this point, there were about 2 minutes before my flight boarded, so I didn't say anything.  I had my credit card waiting on the bar when she got back from her failed trick.  \"Is that it?\"  \"Yes.  Please close me out.\"  (Reluctantly)...  \"OK.\"  You know that there is only one bar per terminal section, right?  Next time, I will just hike over to another section and fight my way into a stand up bar just to avoid this awful, awful place.",

We ordered chicken tacos, cheese quesadilla, chicken taquitos and margaritas.  Almost all of the food was delicious, and it was all fresh.  If the service was better and the prices were lower, I would give them 5 stars.    Chicken Tacos - AMAZING.  Not only the tacos themselves, but the side of rice too (which I swear is coated in butter, but I don't care).  Chicken was well-seasoned and delicious.  $14 is a little steep though.  Cheese Quesadilla - Good and cheesy, but something about it was almost sweet.  Taquitos- The edible parts in the middle were good, but the outsides were fried too long and couldn't be eaten because the chicken inside turned hard-as-a-rock.  Margaritas were good, but $10 for a soda sized glass of margarita is ridiculous.  If I'm in the Phoenix airport again, I would definitely come back for the chicken tacos!",

The airport should require they remain open until at least ten if there are no other choices. I could have stopped before passing through security had I known their posted hours were inaccurate.
