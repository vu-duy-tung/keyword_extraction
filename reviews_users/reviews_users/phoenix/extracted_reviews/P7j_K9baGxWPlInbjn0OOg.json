Its a little cold and tough, almost leathery. I just wanted to put this so Nas could see, maybe heat the pitas up a bit? Or keep them in a warmer area so they aren't as cold/hard? It's a minuscule change, but would make the sandwiches Top tier. Consider it please! From a life time customer!",

I could have used this stuff to lube a car. It was oozing with what tasted like cooking oil, and not fresh cooking oil. The worst thing is that the label did not even indicate that oil was an ingredient.",

If not for the terrible customer service and complete lack of interest on the part of the staff in finding a solution, I'd gladly return. It really is a shame. I came in with my young children, who love Mediterranean food, just not all mixed up together. I personally don't think it's unreasonable to ask for food that tends to run into each other to be on the side, or at least separated. However, if you want anything on the side, they quickly inform you \"that will be an additional $2.99.\"  I'm sorry, but that's just ridiculous. My kids won't eat it if it's all mixed together and the staff just piles everything in a bowl. They don't even have plates to space things out. Very disappointing, because the food itself was actually good and I'd otherwise want to return.",

    "text": "I was super excited to try this place a few days ago, since I love Mediterranean food and I saw this place got good reviews. I definitely wasn't impressed.  Their menu is very vague and since I had never been here before I found it difficult to place my order since it didn't really describe what I was ordering that well. Regardless, I ordered one of the hummus bowls. The workers seemed unorganized and kind of impatient. I ended up feeling like I was ordering at a Chipotle, even though I ordered a pre-made hummus bowl (In other words, I expected them to know what I wanted in it because it was a pre-made option..). Just found it strange. The food was not great. I LOVE hummus but the Jalepeno-cilantro hummus that came with my order was almost tasteless. The chicken was extremely tough. The pita bread was cold and very chewy. It was also an odd mixture if you ask me... A bed of hummus with some rice and veggies and chicken thrown on top. Wasn't really what I was expecting and it didn't fill me up.  Also, when it came time for me to pay I tried to pay with my debit card and the lady at the register said it didn't accept my card because it only had $15 left on it (my total order came out to more than that). So I handed her my credit card instead. Came home to realize that they had charged both my debit AND credit cards. Not too happy about that.  Needless to say, I probably won't be back.",

It reminds me of a Chipotle for Mediterranean food. I got the veggie combo hummus bowl and added a chicken skewer. You basically can tell them what you'd like in it as it goes down the line, with hummus as the base. They also do wraps, salads, and even juice and smoothies.   Their system is better than the assembly line they do at Chipotle (where one person does meats, one person does salsa, etc.)... here you have one person and they go down and finish preparing your entire meal and hand it off to the cashier, then they return back to the front of the line and take the next person. So during the lunch rush, it was very busy and they were well staffed and it moved very nicely. I appreciated that.   The veggie combo was so good. The fallafel was crispy and flavorful, the red pepper hummus was really good, and whatever they marinade the chicken in is amazing! My husband usually isn't a big fan of just grilled chicken but he loved it. I was so full and still have half of my bowl left.   The atmosphere is clean, modern, and simple. They also have 3 different options for brewed iced tea which I love! It was a little pricey but for the quality and taste I'd say it's worth it. I saw a sign that said they are opening a full bar soon and adding a happy hour menu. I will definitely be back!",

I asked could I purchase the veggies ala cart separately again I was told no, because \"he\" doesn't like to do it that way. I just really didn't understand why I could not purchase the veggies as I normally do. The reason given was beyond lame & after being a long time customer of pita I'm extremely disappointed",

My only complaint is that the chicken was not hot. Unfortunate as I was there when the doors opened so you would expect hot off the grill.",

I would have rather gone to the gas station and bought the Sabra hummus & pretzels - I would have been more satisfied. The hummus was bland and watery, pita chips - there was like two on the salad.

I mainly docked it down because the staff seemed super bland and robotic. I asked a few questions and got blank stares back. They never were very friendly and I'm wondering if they even have personalities at all....?  I was very disappointed because my boyfriend and I were hoping to get a glass of wine from the bar while we ate, but no one was behind there. When we asked an employee, their response was that the bartender was on break and they didn't know how to do the bar stuff. When we told her we just wanted a glass of wine, she shrugged and walked away. I'll give them the benefit of doubt: maybe they were all underage and not allowed to pour alcohol. But there should be someone of age in the building if you have a bar...   Anyways. I'll probably be back to give it another shot. I hope I have a better experience.",

I forgot all of what the choices of extras you could add to your bowl, but I remember there were lots of veggies, which I liked.  For all of the other reviews who said service wasn't that great, I would disagree.  The girl serving me my food was really friendly and took her time explaining things to me.  She also had me try their PB sauce, which was interesting bc it was vegan but it tasted really creamy.  I liked it!  Especially since I can't eat dairy.  I wouldn't say the flavors were out of this world, but I like that it's a healthy quick option for food, that is really convenient to where I live.  I will be back!",

    "text": "This is the Chipotle of pita places, and I wouldn't call that an endorsement.  I've been there twice and Pita Bistro will not be on the top of my list for lunch spots.  My first experience was okayish, I had a gyro wrap with pretty standard gyro ingredients.  The veggies were crisp and the meat was fairly flavorful.  They asked if I would like rice or lentils, I chose lentils...and they put them ON my gyro.  I was expecting a side (the menu wasn't super clear, it just said that the wraps came with lentils or rice) and suddenly my perfectly adequate gyro was covered in lentils.  This wouldn't have been too terrible, except that the lentils were HARD and flavorless and there were a lot of them.  Skip the lentils or rice and it probably would have been alright.  Today I tried a hummus bowl...it was bad.  They take your choice of hummus and spread it all over the bottom of the bowl and load everything on top of it.  In theory this would be fine, but by the time I got to the end of the line my bowl looked like a runny mash up of hummus and vegetables, topped with some lukewarm shwarma.  I was still hopeful until they wedged my tiny slivers of pita bread mostly under the hummus.  I made the 3 minute trip back to my office and everything in the bowl was already soggy and had mixed itself into an unappealing paste.  Some of the individual components of the meal could have been good, but mashed together into a soggy lump I could only made it halfway through my bowl before I gave up.  It's currently sitting like a rock in my stomach and I'm a little nauseated.  The components: Original hummus - a little runny but okay flavor Veggies (tomatoes, red onions, cucumber) - seemed fresh enough, the cucumbers and onion were crisp Mediterranean salad stuff - watery and flavorless except for some parsley Tzaziki - I don't think the liquid they sloshed over my bowl deserved to be called tzaziki.  It was thin, translucent, and just waterlogged the bowl without adding any flavor chicken shwarma - okay flavor, but a little tough pita bread - probably would have been fine if it hadn't been shoved into the hummus soup, but it ended up soggy  The service is standard for any of these production line quick-serve restaurants.  There are a half dozen people behind the counter, straining to hear over the din of the dining room.  They kind of hear your instructions, but they're super busy and a little impatient if you hesitate or ask a question.  I don't actually mind that- I know they're busy and the pay probably sucks- so I'm not going to expect 5 star service.  But the food wasn't good, so I'm not going back either.",

The woman taking our order had a sticker indicating she was in training. She spoke very softly and we had to ask her to repeat things several times before her trainer finally had to step in and ask us the questions in an audible voice. I also felt like the menu wasn't very clear. The kebobs come with tomato, cucumber, and onion. They have a mix of those veggies diced up so I assumed that was what went into my hummus bowl but it turns out it is actual slices of veg which doesn't make much sense for a bowl. They upcharged me for adding the diced and mixed version of the exact same veggies with a bit of parsley mixed in. They also lost points because the drink lids for the regular size drink didn't fit and both our drinks leaked on the way back to the office. And thank goodness we had utensils already at the office because the utensil holder at the restaurant was disgusting dirty.   As for the food, it wasn't anything special. The chicken was overcooked and rubbery. The hummus was bland. Overall, I don't think I'd give this place a second shot, there just wasn't anything motivating me to return.",

My only reasons for giving 4 stars instead of 5-- feels like every employee gives drastically different portions when I get a bowl. Some people give two full scoops of hummus, others don't. So it's hard to gauge how much I'm getting, proportions, etc.   Also... I hate to be that guy but I'd love some nutrition facts. I can kind of gauge it but as someone who is somewhat health conscious I'd like to know just how many calories I'm consuming when I feast on a big hummus bowl.",

I came during dinner and they barely had anything prepared which was frustrating since I brought a big party with me. A similar situation occurred during a previous visit, but not to this extent.  Imagine going to chipotle and having to wait 25 minutes during dinner time to make chicken. In addition the employees didn't offer any pita bread with our bowls which added to the frustration. And when we did get the pita it was very stale.   I was very surprised and disappointed by my last and final experience because they weren't even busy!

There was also a check in off Yelp for a free side hummus with order. Looked at the menu, called it in. Ordered a chicken shawarma. Got back to work. The free hummus was probably about 3-4 ounces but the bad of pita chips to go with it was like a small brown lunch bag size. I thought to myself, hope that's the size only for the free size and they don't actually charge for that. Way too much chip for the hummus amount. The shawarma was great. I would order this again in a heartbeat.",

This was my second time visiting this location, the first time I visited my food was cold too but yesterday I decided to give them another chance. I ordered a chicken kebob pita and the chicken was cold and slightly dry. I also ordered greek fries, they too were cold and tasted like they had been sitting there. Fries should be hot and taste like they just came out of the fryer. I would definitely give them another chance if they addressed the aforementioned issues.",

The food is very tasty and the ingredients are always fresh. I almost always get the veggie bowl combo. Some days they load it up to where I can eat half of it and save the rest for another meal altogether, but other days it's much lighter, just enough for the one meal (guess it depends on who is working that day?)   I have only had one really bad experience, and that was a few days ago. In the middle of my meal one of the workers came around to clean some tables. She was using a really strong cleanser - like Mistolin or the neon-colored Mr. Clean used to mop floors. Suddenly the entire restaurant reeked of cleanser. I don't usually mind that smell so much, but I don't enjoy it while I am eating. I understand they need to keep the place clean, but I spent 15 years working in restaurants and there are other ways to do it without giving the patrons a headache. I had actually brought a book with me and intended to hang out and eat for a little while but instead took my food to go. But like I said, I've been here many times and that was the only time I experienced anything like that so I won't judge them too harshly off of the one incident. If I come back and it happens again I might just always eat their food at home.",

    "text": "This is my second time dining in since the establishment first opened it's doors. I was excited to see something different in the area. Something unlike the traditional fast food restaurants. As a fan favorite of Mediterranean food  the concept of this restaurant is the way we want to see our food establishments move to. Similar concept to Chipolte though much more options to choose from.   The venue is very trendy with a healthy atmosphere type of flare. You walk in and there are virtual menus on large digitals screens making it easy to view the menu options. What is nice is there are suggestions to choose from our you can create your own. I have not been daring and ordered the same thing I had the first time which was the Chicken Shawerma Pita. I got it as is minus the PB Dip. I added the mediterranean chop along with a vinaigrette. The portion was perfect. Matter of fact it was not to heavy it was just right. Next time around I plan to be more creative as the restaurant has kabobs, salads, tasty sides and an affordable juice bar.   I did go at lunch time both times. The line was super long but went fast. There are plenty of staff on hand to make the process smooth.   Pros:  It's clean. I repeat it is clean To Go Cooler with pre made salads and other food options Plenty of seating inside though the outside seating is not setup yet Mini bar with happy hour coming soon Beer, Wine and Spirits coming soon  I hope to see more of these pop up in the valley. I see great things for this mediterranean style of restaurant.",

    "text": "Not gonna lie, I wasn't the biggest fan of Pita Bistro. Everything I ate was a little bland and really not that satisfying. Sad, I know.   This is a conveyor belt style, fast casual spot. You choose your main vehicle - wrap, salad, bowl type deal, choose your protein, toppings and sauces and boom.   I went with a create your own chicken shawarma salad and I've had a lot better. The chicken itself was flavorless. Not dry, not especially juicy, but zero spice. The salad wasn't fresh and juicy, but seemed rather like it was straight from a ginormous bag. This isn't boding well.  The toppings were fresh, but nothing added any flavor to this dish that desperately needed it. I opted for some hot sauce, hummus and tzatziki and the desired income of flavor was missed, instead making a pile of flavorless mush. It was a whole lot of meh, not gonna lie. A bite of my friend's falafel sealed the deal. Far from the real thing and really dry.   I however will still give this spot three stars. Why? Because I know really good Mediterranean and maybe others don't. Also, this place has a ton of seating and is quite nice for a rather casual lunch. And, I can't hat that they are offering up healthy eats from the salads and bowls to the fresh juices.   Not the worst $11 lunch, but I can tell ya, I've definitely had way better shawarma, hummus and all that jazz.",

My coworker thought is was only okay too.  He had a bowl of theirs that had gyro meat, rice, etc.  Overall I won't be back when I'm back in Tempe.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been coming to Pita Bistro for four years and last night we both agreed it wasn't what we are use to in quality. When we first arrived we noticed the a remodel to seating area, which was nice since we now have a little one and I remember the old set up being a little cramped. We were the only people in line and in the restaurant so I figured we could take our time since it's been a while. There were three employees working in the back, but they were working as though they were about to close. As soon as my husband started to order, the guy behind the counter seemed to be rushing him.  Before my husband could finish saying one thing, the guy was like, \" what else ? Ok, what else?\" If you would chill out for a second, he will tell you what else and you could save asking so many times. He then makes my bowl, but since I already knew what he was going to do I just kept the ball rolling. When we got to the protein he puts the meat and hurries to check us out. I then let him know I've got the Yelp check in coupon which he grabs the bag of pita chips and gives us and then proceeds to finish the sale. However, I also had a save 15% off, so he' informs me I need to put my number in. After we pay and sit down we then realize he never asked if we wanted pita bread because he was concerned with getting us, the only people in line, out the line. When I go back up to get it, a young lady was wiping the counter, she said she would get it. So I walk to get forks and come back and she has it in her hand but now helping another customer and now the customer who has already paid (me) has become a lower priority. After we are seated another person starts sweeping literally right around us. Im sure if I had lifted my feet, she would have swept underneath. My husband and I then make the observation that the meat portion is much smaller then it used to be and the pita bread somehow was soggy. At this point I realize the Pita Bisto doesn't seem the same. I'm usually excited about packing leftovers, but this time I wanted to throw away not only the food but the experience as well. When we got to our cars we mentioned how disappointed we were, sucks even more because we live in East Mesa. The store itself is nice, but definitely need to have customer service oriented people working, like some that worked here in the past. Not sure if and when we will return after this.",

Well, if you want a quick healthy, fresh and delicious bite, you should come here!   First of all, before I go any further, if you're in the mood for a wrap, check-in here and get free chips and hummus. They have a Siracha hummus that made my mouth very happy (I love spicy food). It was spicy yet flavorful, so you got lots of taste with the heat. The texture was very appealing, smooth and you could taste the tahini and olive oil. I really enjoyed this.   There are lots of other businesses at this location, so while it might be busy around the lunch hour, there is plenty of parking.   It is counter service and resembles Chipotle in set-up, ordering and seating. I felt that in the world or counter service this location deserved 4.5 stars given speed (despite how full it was), service and taste of food. You can order an existing combo or Salad, rice, hummus bowls or wraps. I got a salad with a bunch of veggies and shawarma. The veggies were fresh, crisp and portions were generous. The chicken was well marinated and tasted of garlic and yogurt marinade, so it was savory with a little tanginess. It was well cook as it was succulent and not dry.   I want to go back and try their other options. They also have a juice bar and make smoothies.   It's like an oasis in the desert you can feel good about given all the healthy choices. Thanks the the freshness of ingredients and top notch  seasoning, it's delightful minus any guilt!   Come check them out...",

They have regular or whole wheat pita bread to top it off with. I usually can't eat the entire thing in one serving and end up saving some for later. It's a great value for your money.  This place has a huge lunch rush so get there early if you can. The line does move quickly though. If you come in the evening it's very rarely busy.

More times than not they have been out of wheat pitas and they just shrug and wait for you to decide if you want white pita or to just hit the road (which I have done on more than one occasion).  Also, they charge significantly for you to customize your wrap or bowl.  One minor change from any of their preset options and you are kicked into the higher price \"build your own\" option.  Also, be very watchful when they are putting your toppings on.  One time you will get half a cup of something and the next time barely any.  I don't think consistency is a major goal for the staff here.  Otherwise, the food is tasty and healthy.  I continue to go back but keep my eyes open.",

    "text": "By far the best Mediterranean food in the area. Serving size is enough for two meals. Price is great. Fast food pricing for healthy delicious food. Meat is fresh and cooked daily. Hummus is incredible. Chicken is spiced to perfection. Gyro is the freshest in town. The serving set up is identical to chipotle. Atmosphere is very comfortable and clean. There will be a full service bar very soon. If you need a quick meal and don't want fattening fried food this is the place for you. Most fast food pita joints are dingy and smell. This place is most certainly deserving of a five star review.",

The two girls serving the food on the line seemed like zombies, very unhappy and didn't even say hi, just asked what i wanted. They just kind of slinged everything i wanted in my bowl and that was it. My wife is a very picky eater, she originally wanted a chicken schwarma and the person started throwing stuff in it, not even asking if she wanted any of it. When i asked her to remake it, she kind of gave an attitude, quickly wrapped up and threw away the food.  She remade it but did not seem happy about it.  The girl at the register was very nice, i left a tip for her. The sad part is, this was my first time here. My wife and i have been talking about checking this place out for a while and we were very disappointed with our experience. I guess the take away from this is that the food and atmosphere are great, not going to take that away from them, but the customer service is very lacking and downright depressing. If the service had been different, i would have given a 5 star rating.",

It was mostly hummus, flavorless rice, tomatoes and onions. I won't be back here any time soon when there are so many other wonderful Greek/Mediterranean restaurants to choose from.",

If my lunchtime life was the equivalent of that Lifetime/Netflix show called You about a creepy stalker turned serial killer, I'd be Joe (the charming murderer) and Pita Bistro would be Beck (the average blonde). Funny, cause in real life, I'm already the average blonde. It's nice to switch up rolls every once in a while.   Anyway, I faithfully visited my beloved Pita B (the nickname I gave my sweet obsession) weekly until the day I realized Pita B never loved me back ... then I murdered Pita B online with this review.   No, not really, I'm hoping Pita B is more like Joe's first love. The one who makes an appearance at the very end just in time to give everyone hope. Come on, B, figure your sh*t out! If we love each other, there's still hope for a bright future.   Fix your kabobs. Cook your chicken properly. Someone brew some damn tea every once in a while. You can do this, B. I believe in you.   But for real, I've had undercooked chicken here so many times. And what the f is that new seasoning mix on the kabobs? It's terrible. Truly. Why fix what isn't broken? You're ruining this. Don't you still love me, Pita B? Show me you love me.   I know something is wrong, because I get sick now every time I go. Hold up, wait a minute. I think I have this all wrong. Pita B is the twisted one and I'm still the average blonde believing in something too good to be True. Damn, now I gotta find a new food-love to blindly follow in the never ending effort to live a healthy lifestyle.",

    "text": "I have not been by for some time. Last year Yelp check in gave you a free bag of chips and a small dip for free if you checked in. When I checked in yesterday, I noticed yelp removed it. Bummer - strike one.   The store has changed. They had a wood style wall with an attach seat that was in the sitting area. Now it's just open seating. Not as cozy as it use to be... I liked the booths better. It really was a better Ambiance with the booths.  I personally prefer they bring them back. It seemed very sterile when I went in and that didn't make me want to stay and eat.   The staff was very young. No hello. Lots of standing around and talking to each other. But that wasn't my issue. Lately I've decided that a friendly face and a little conversation is a nice complement to an establishments customer service when you walk in.  The two women at the front of the station didn't smile, had nothing Pleasant to offer and just stood there waiting for the order.   Last year they had a completely different staff. They were friendly. They tried to talk or at least offer some suggestions. They appeared happy to serve.   This time, the atmosphere was pretty cold and sterile. For a while I was coming almost twice a week. Because I really liked their burritos and bowls. The staff was pretty nice & engaging last year.   But the new layout and the new staff really just fell flat.  I didn't get my free bag of chips with check in. They no longer offer sauce if you have points to get a free bag of chips. The staff isn't trained to be more friendly. No one offered more than necessary. I had a few questions and they really didn't try to answer my question with any type of interest. In fact the the cashier was pretty annoyed with me because I kept digging into my purse trying to find my debit card and then I remembered I had a phone number to type into the little keypad.  I donno.... I was disappointed. Food was OK. Nothing was spoiled.  I will say a happy staff would make their new sterile environment a little warmer in the store.  My drink cup also had a crushed rim. Made it harder to add my lid.  But I'm sure they are efficient during the lunch hour if you need to get your food and run. I came in after 2:30 and the place was pretty dead.  I might be back...",

The first time I visited, my food was excellent - ordered a gyro bowl and the meat and veggies were very fresh.  Today I ordered the C.C.C bowl and the quality level of the dish was less than expected based on my initial visit, however I still rate this business 4 stars!  The reason for the 4 stars is not only because my meal was excellent during my first visit, but also because their website allowed me to contact them directly to express my concerns...and I received a response in less than an hour!  I firmly believe that when things go wrong, they can still be just fine - it all depends on how problems are addressed and this business responded faster than I had expected!  I enjoy supporting small businesses and I will continue to support this business based on their attentiveness to their customer's concerns.  Thank you!",

I get through the long line to the last protein stop before paying. \"Hard pita\" she said and sent me to the back of the growing line. OK, fine. I finally get to the protein part again and she throws on beef. I don't want beef.  I'm sent to the back of the line, again! No. After 20 minutes I leave without food and forced to eat somewhere else to eat something I didn't want. I know nothing about running a restaurant.

I have to say I am pretty impressed with the size of the Gyro (I got a gyro wrap combo)  It came with a large wrap, pita chips, jalapeno cilantro humus, and a drink,  for the price of only 10 bucks.  The combo is a steal.  I enjoyed the wrap, and the the hummus was pretty tasty too.  I have never had pita chips quite like they have, but I do like them.    I really enjoyed the meal.  I dont drink soda so I opted to try the green tea since it came with the combo.  Not sure how I feel about it.  It kind of taste like a tire :/.  I will definitely be revisiting to try the food again, not the tea though.    I will say that the food was cold when I received it.  I did do delivery, but the location is less than 5 minutes away. (I cant leave my office on certain days so that's why I did delivery)  I am just going to assume that delivery had something to do with the food being cold, so when I visit the location next time, I will update my review.",

    "text": "Oh so good  Today a co-worker and I headed to Pita Bistro for lunch. The line was out the door, but we decided to stay and I'm so glad we did.    I can see why the line was out the door.  The staff  were very friendly, and everything was fresh and oh so good.  Pita Bistro offers many options and you can even build your own pita/schwarma.  On this visit I had the steak wrap and my co-worker decided to go with the chicken wrap, and we shared the  roasted red pepper hummus with pita chips.   The steak wrap was very flavorful and large enough for two and the roasted red pepper hummus was awesome, just the right flavor. The food overall is wonderful, service is good, and the prices are wallet friendly. The restaurant is on the smaller side so the seating could be limited but it's worth the wait.",

Went with the girls for lunch that day and we absolutely fell in love!! The food was amazingly delicious and we couldn't stop raving about every bite we took! On top of that we were able to customize a raw juice which I loved the idea of and the taste even more! Let's just say we were hooked from the beginning and went back for lunch everyday and for juices on breaks from the training. It wasn't only the food and juice that brought us back..we were drawn instantly to the charisma of Nas and Sam and the attention they had to the atmosphere and attention to detail for their customers! I love the feeling of the place and you can tell that they live to a philosophy and not only to making money! I will be visiting as often as possible, even after the end of my training..they have made me a loyal customer",

I ordered a bowl (generous portion) and specified how I wanted it - the options are really endless and taste fresh.

And UNLIKE chipotle you can add anything that can fit onto your bowl without the up charge, at chipotle there's a fee for the extras and a bowl ends up costing $10-$11! Food tastes fresh and the flavor is on point!   Service: the staff here gets a 5 star rating from me.

Reminded me of a very popular burrito fast food restaurant that gets your order done right as you get to checkout with all the fixings you want along the way.  I ordered the gyro, with all the veggies and extra tzakziki sauce to wash it down.  The burrito, I mean gyro/pita, was rather good despite my lack of enthusiasm for knowing there were so many other good places to eat for lunch near by.    I am giving this 3 stars, not just because I hate hummus, but also because I am not a fan of fast food of any kind, especially chipotle style fast food.  The food was healthy and fresh which is why this is not a 2 or 1 star.    As far as price goes, this restaurant gets 4 stars in my book.  Cheap and quick!

I had the hummus bowl with the siracha and jalapeno ciliantro hummus, salad, tablouleh, cucumber tomato salad, olives, feta, and more.  For $7.95, it was more than enough and was fresh and delicious!  I didn't try any PB sauce, or any other sauce.    The pita is thin, but I didn't mind that and thought it was really good.  As far as portion discrepancy, I saw that it does depend on the person making the bowl, but I am not afraid to ask for more if I feel I'm not getting what I want.  They didn't give me any grief about it and gave me more.  No problem.  I definitely recommend this place and will come back next time I'm in Phoenix.",

I understand how busy they get, but I just am really over the rushed feeling I get.  99% of the time, I don't get everything I want.  Either the person making my food is 20 feet ahead of me waiting for me to yell over people in line, or there's some jerk behind me in line pushing forward because his server is skipping past my server!  Even when I get there as early as 10:30am like I did last week, I still felt rushed by the server with NO LINE!  Today, I was literally asked what toppings I wanted when I was still 10 feet away from the toppings!  I've been there before, but I'd love to look at them all and pick them, not just guess the ones I do remember!  Slow down!  I don't care about the line.  By the time I got to the register there was a giant stack of bowls and wraps and people waiting to pay in a big clump, it amazed me that the cashier was able to keep it all organized.  Kudos to her.  The food is good, if you're not easily frustrated like I am, you'll really enjoy yourself.  I just wish they'd be sure each customer is happy, instead of just getting through as fast as possible.",

    "text": "I have given this place multiple chances before I decided to write this review- I have gone there about 8 times in the last 6 weeks, and each time I have had the exact same problem.  First let me start with the quality food- being from the Middle East, I know what the food should taste like, it is at best average. The chicken fattoush is probably the best, the rest of the \"protein\" they offer is tasteless and dry. The gyros though, are the absolute worst. The look, taste and texture is like rubber. The hummus is good. The tabouli is also good. The problem I have had here every single time is with the staff- they are uninterested and obviously hate their jobs, so they take it out on your food. They can't hear,despite repeating the same request 50 times. Partly, because they aren't looking at you, and mostly because they just don't give a shit. The cashier I had last time had a resting bitch face- maybe it was the mass acne all over her face, but I think it was simply the fact that I'm a girl because I watched her erupt in giggles with every male customer. I had asked the girl at the end for pita bread which comes with bowls, and after asking 10 times, she still didn't hear me, so when I got to the cashier (located about 5 inches to her right), I asked for the pita break. She started pointing and waving her finger at me instructing me that \"you tell her if you want pita bread and then you come to me.\" The only saving grace of this place is their manager who I spoke to and complained to- she handled it very gracefully and politely and offered me a free bowl with my rewards. This was the first time I ever heard of their rewards program because the cashiers never mentioned in before.  The portions this place serves are unbalanced- this is again due to the lack of shits given by the employees- every time I go in, they dish out the food like there's a famine. They literally pick 1-3 of everything and place it on the bowl. 1-3 chickpeas, 1-3 olives, 1-3 cucumbers, 1-3 beets. If they dare use the tiny spoon, it's still the same amount. If I ask for more than 3 chickpeas, they'll give me 2 more-man that could last me an extra 2 days !! The worst part, is that they just stand there, and after slapping the humus and few grains of rice, they shove the bowl at the end of the food assembly line skipping all toppings. They don't ask if you want anything, they don't give you what you ask for, and when they do, the quantity is not worth the $11. I already complained about this to the manager, but nothing changed.  The pita bread should not be stuffed into the bowl because it makes it soggy and wet. The bread is left out exposed to air, so it's pretty stiff and hard (maybe that's why they do this ?) The previous 7 times I went in, they never ever offered me pita bread- so I found out about it much later. Which brings me to my last point- the menu is dumb. It is not clear, with charges being added to weird things like \"make your own bowl\"- when there is nothing additional given in that bowl compared to other bowls on the menu. On top of that, because of their terrible staff, you're never told when there's an extra charge (they probably don't know themselves). Every time I order the same thing, I get charged different amounts. I come here only because it is close to work, and most other options are not that healthy. At this point though, I'm going to go to panda express, jimmy johns, or quizznos.  They seriously need to get their act together.",

They spread a full layer of hummus on the bottom of the container, which serves as a great base and pretty much eliminates the need for dressing.   The reason for the 3-star rating is the simple fact that their pita bread was sub-par. I've had better from the grocery store.

    "text": "The food at pita bistro was good, nothing to go crazy about. For the $11 I paid for my meal it was worth it.   I got a pita bowl with hummus, a lot of veggies, and gyro meat. The meat was delicious, but they loaded it up with hummus. I recommend the sriracha hummus!!  The only major negative I had was the pita bread pieces. They seemed to firm and stale. It could have very well of been a bad batch of pita bread, but overall I would recommend this place to someone who is in for a tasty and healthy meal for anywhere from $8-$12.",
