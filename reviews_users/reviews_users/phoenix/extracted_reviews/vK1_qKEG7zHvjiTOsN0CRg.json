We added sides of perfect hash browns and extra-crispy bacon. Wow!   Our server was superb and Snooze has a nice buzz about it. We plan to go back with family and friends! Parking nearby was easy with meters along the street.   Snooze is one of the very best!",

    "text": "My experience at Snooze was vastly different that my breakfast the prior day. That place wasn't bad, just over hyped. It did gave me a 'C' baseline to compare. The snooze decor is, 'up beat' in a late 60's space Era, Tupperware colors kind of way. I liked it. Service was great. Lyle was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and gave us a complimentary pancake to sample. It was whiskey, maple, white chocolate chip something. Damn awesome is what it was. My wife and I snacked part of it down as an appetizer and the rest as dessert. I love the fact they let you mix and match both pancakes and Benedict items. I couldn't decide between the Steak or Chile Verde Benedict so I got one of each. They were both excellent. My wife got the shrimp and grits special and it was also very good. There is pet friendly outdoor seating which is always a good thing whether you prefer to dine near or far from our 4 legged pals. Strongly suggest you give them a try.",

SNOOZE AM EATERY: THE HISTORY   Snooze has locations in Colorado, California and 4 in the Phoenix area (Camelback, College, Gilbert and Kierland).   Every Snooze has the iconic super hype decor and edgy lighting. (see pics)   And of course, their amazing menu which includes all sorts of yummy eggs and hollandaise specials, sandwiches and many sides,  BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PANCAKES!!  Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes Sweet Potato Pancakes  Drunken Punk'n Pancakes Blueberry Danish Pancakes  Pancake of the Day Chocolate Chip Pancakes  Peanut Butter Cup Pancakes   And my favorite: Pancake Flight - which is where you can chose any 3 from above!

Great service, awesome old school vibe (it's like being on the Jetson's set) and even better is the food.  We split the pancake flight:  the Sinful (cinnamon, bacon, pecans), Pineapple Upside Down and the Pumpkin with white chocolate chips and some other stuff.  The Sinful was my absolute favorite. This is a huge amount of very very rich pancakes that you could easily share with someone.   We *also* split the breakfast pot pie.  YUM.  I loved that it was open faced, served on a fluffy, buttery puff pastry.  They also top it with eggs, but I detest any runny yolk so I got them scrambled on the side. I loved the pot pie and it wasn't too too filling (in a good way). This place has a variety of morning drinks (mimosas and such) and are really reasonably priced.   This will be a regular on my brunch lineup!",

And because Tempe is desperately short on great breakfast options.   I know people love snooze, I know, but I just can't get past a few things:  1. The hash browns. They are not crispy. Ever. Actually they are totally bland.   2. While the egg benedict options are good, most of them leave me feeling really heavy after breakfast. This stands to reason to an extent, but I've had Benedicts that are not this way.   3. There is an absence of anything really great. Almost everything on the menu I have ordered (all of the Benedicts, sausage, pancakes, French toast, bacon) are ok or good. But not great.",

    "text": "Another gem that Yelp led me to.  Saw the ratings and decided to check this place out...a hipster, cool breakfast joint with amazing menu choices and great atmosphere.  I had the Hashbrown plate, topped with 2 sunny-side up eggs and added hickory sausage gravy and bacon.  Now if you are a \"carbophobe\" I would suggest you not order, but if amazing spuds are your weakness you won't go wrong.  The plate came loaded with country-style hashbrowns and my guess is 50000+ grams of carbs (at least) :).  Also ordered a cappuccino and was pleasantly surprised with it's somewhat chocolatey flavor that was unusual in a great way.  Breakfast for one with cappuccino and tip was $20, but very well worth it. A couple of things to note: 1.  My Google map app was trying to take me wayyyy off course, so I am not sure if it was just my phone or if it's a Google map defect?  If you are unfamiliar with the area around ASU be careful you don't get sent to East Bumble F by your phone.  Take University to College Ave, go north on College and it's on the right near the aquatic center 2. There is no parking lot so you either park on the street near the restaurant or there is a parking deck on the little street behind the restaurant.  If you choose street parking the parking spots are metered and will take coins or, get this, will accept your phone reading a QR code to bill the parking fee.  I had no spare change and my phone would not read the code so I headed over to the deck and lo-and-behold...parking was free (it was Saturday morning, 8.30am and evidently not a \"game day\").  BTW the restaurant is maybe a block from Sun Devil Stadium so I can only imagine the mess it would be when the Sun Devils are playing at home. I LOVE SNOOZE AM!  Definitely a chain that would dominate if it goes nationwide!",

We placed our name on the list and were told it was about an hour and fifteen minute wait.    We weren't deterred because if it was good as Denver, it would be worth the wait.  We returned from walking around the campus in the estimated time and were seated shortly after.  As with Denver, the wait was worth it.  Friendly staff and great food! The French toast is a must try and is our favorite.",

There was a little bit of a wait to get seated but we ended up sitting at a shared high top table which was fine with us.  There were a variety of delicious options to choose from on the menu, along with some tasty mimosas! My husband and I both tried versions of Eggs Benedict. I had the Early Harvest Benny and he had the Benny Duo - Ham Benedict III and Chile Verde Benny. Both meals were excellent! Great flavors and very reasonably priced. I loved the griddles cauliflower, green harissa and poblano pepper quinoa cakes! I really wish there was a Snooze in GA so I could try some of their other delicious menu items!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I both had work off yesterday, which happened to be a Monday (we typically don't have Mondays off so we wanted to take advantage!). Based on a quick Yelp search, we decided to try breakfast at Snooze. Being a Monday at 10:30, I didn't anticipate how busy this place would be! Granted, we are in a college town and in the thick of things at ASU where most students don't have a traditional schedule, but looking around there were people of all ages filling up the place. The wait was only about 10 minutes and while I would have loved to sit on their beautiful, tree-filled patio, we settled for a booth in the corner inside as we were both famished.   I decided to go with the 3 egg omelet and added avocado, garlic and tomato. This came with a choice of toast (I picked sour dough) and hash browns. The boyfriend had one of their several unique eggs benedict options, choosing the Chili Verde Benny. I can't speak for him entirely, but he cleaned his plate in under 10 minutes. The hashbrowns arrived in a neat stack and the presentation was almost as great as the meal itself. The ingredients were incredibly fresh and well prepared. I realize this is breakfast and not a gourmet dining experience, but it was certainly one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.   Being a Monday, I decided to dry-out and opted for coffee - although they had a lot of enticing breakfast cocktail items. My breakfast date was a little more adventurous and tried the \"Snooze Fashioned\": Cyrus Noble Bourbon, Cold Brewed Coffee, Cherry Shurb and Bitters, which he very much enjoyed!  Lest I forget, the service was pretty spot on as well. I believe our servers name was Flip. He seemed almost as excited about the place as we were, and that was refreshing! He offered suggestions for future visits and was fun/attentive without being at all overbearing.  Needless to say, we will definitely be back. A great spot to bring family or friends who might be visiting from out of town :)",

There were no seats left so we sat at the bar.  I ordered corned beef hash with eggs over hard, toast and coffee while my friend ordered french toast and juice.   The coffee came quickly but it was freezing cold outside so i drank the coffee as quickly as it was poured.  They never offered to refill my coffee.  The food finally came out.  The toast was warm and thick and covered in butter.   The eggs that i had asked overhard came out almost over done and scrambled.  The corned beef hash was almost non existent.  It was barly a spoonful.  Although the food did taste good, it was not what i expected.",

    "text": "Snooze is my guilty pleasure breakfast place. I know I've been here way more than 3 times despite the check ins saying otherwise.  Anyway, there are two main routes you can take at Snooze: savory or sweet.  On the savory side you have classic eggs options, gargantuan burritos, and my personal favorite, the breakfast pot pie. The breakfast pot pie consists of a square puff pastry smothered in gravy, veggies, and replaces chicken with egg! You also get hash browns on the side.  On the sweet side of Snooze you have a wide variety of pancakes (the pancake flight is a crowd favorite), decadent French toast, and morning cocktails.  My favorite from this group is the pancake flight. Being able to select three types of pancakes the size of dinner plates is fun and the selection changes based on what is the pancake of the day. In my opinion though, you can't go wrong with the chocolate chip pan cakes. (Side note, while I haven't had it yet, there is some kind of caramel or cinnamon French toast that my friends swear by, worth checking out.)   Bonus: on Caturday all the staff wear cat inspired attire!",

This was correct to a degree but quickly found out once we were seated that the reason people weren't leaving was because food came out so slow. After being seated we waited around 40 minutes for our food to come out.  My breakfast burrito was rubbish unfortunately. The chorizo was really not nice as it was cooked on it own and dumped into the burrito without being mixed with the eggs. It was overpowering and made the whole burrito taste like raw paprika. The green chile sauce wasn't great either and was poured onto the burrito with cheese sprinkled on top meaning if I didn't want to eat the chile I didn't get any cheese and the burrito desperately needed cheese.  Filling was boring in all honesty.  I ordered a hash brown on the side and boy, oh boy was I  disappointed. A thick circle of potato completely pale in colour and verging on undercooked.  No crisp or crunch, it was a potato cake and not a hash brown.  Girlfriend enjoyed her eggs benedict but once again it was nothing special at all. She was bothered that her eggs were over cooked and not runny at all but after waiting 40 minutes to be seated and 40 minutes for the food she didn't want to complain because she was starving.  All three of the pancakes from the pancake flight were too sweet for us but that's a personal preference. Our soft drinks and water were topped up quickly but the coffee wasn't refilled at all, not sure if there are no refills for coffee or they jus didn't notice but either way that kinda sucked.  Very average food and at $50 for two and a half people we wouldn't return ever.",

My Benny Duo was a Bela! Bela! Benedict plus a Chile Verde Benedict. The Bela was excellent: good balance of flavors, texture and spices. The bread was toasted just right, the hollandaise was rich and thick. The chile verde was good as well but I had just had pulled pork for dinner the night before so it didn't thrill.   The order came with a side of arugula drizzled with balsamic vinegar, which was a good foil to the thick sauces.   The other dishes got good responses from my family. The service was almost adequate but a bit hurried. Too bad. For a $60 breakfast I would like at least some attention.   I would recommend Snooze AM for brunch but try to avoid busy times.",

Walking back from Tempe park, I wanted to stop for breakfast sooner but I didn't have money with me, I had to go back to my car first to get my credit card. Conveniently located next to where I parked, this restaurant was perfect as I didn't have to walk anymore.  Initially I was told 20 mins wait, but they have some seats available with bar height chairs, I was told they were first come first served. Shortly after I sat down, friendly server came to take an order. She was extremely busy but her service was prompt.   Food is excellent. We had pinnacle upside down pancake and ham Benedict, both tasted very good, solid breakfast.  Porched egg was cooked perfect, good sauce, I also enjoyed their hash browns. Good textures.  Good portion size, definitely hit the spot after running.  Parking was free for runners when I arrived at 6:30am but notice they charge $5 for special event when I came back. Not sure how much is parking normally.  I always thought Tempe is just a college town and never ventured out here but now I know, I would like to explore this area more.",

Unfortunately this time was just something else. A friend and I went in for some Saturday morning breakfast ordered water, orange juice, and I got an iced coffee. I received my coffee after about 10 minutes but we didnt receive the orange juice or water for even more time. Minor issue, so we looked past it and ordered some breakfast tacos. Some time later our food was delivered to our table, presented perfectly, we pick up our tacos and sad to say they break in an instant. We ordered corn tortillas, but the tortillas were soggy when we got them so we ended up eating our tacos with forks. Ate one taco, decided to take the rest to go, and while boxing up my pico on my taco I noticed a big black hair.  Unfortunately my friend and I are both blonde or else I would have been less disgusted by the hair I found in my food. Needless to say I ended up tossing those leftovers.",

    "text": "Snooze has a pretty trendy atmosphere overall. Well decorated with a light and bright feel throughout. It's located basically on ASU campus. I came in on a Sunday afternoon and they told me it was going to be a 45 minute wait and considering the area, I'm sure that's pretty typical. The good news is it only ended up being a 20 minute wait. Not much seating in the tiny waiting area but I was lucky enough to snag a chair. Free wifi that you don't need a code for, and I thought it was cool that they text you when your table is ready so you don't have to sit there and wait for your name to be called or carry around one of those weird little things that vibrate.   We sat outside and even though it was like 98 degrees, sitting under the umbrella was surprisingly not that hot. I ordered the Sandwich I Am with a Pineapple Upside Down Pancake.  Everything was FANTASTIC. The pancake was unbelievably tasty. Might sound stupid but it tasted exactly like...you guessed it...pineapple upside down cake! The consistency was perfect and the cinnamon butter on top was delicious. My Sandwich I Am was sort of like a McDonald's sausage and egg biscuit but with real ingredients, and I mean that in a good way. Loved the pretzel bread bun. The hash browns were on point too.   I've gotta comment on our server, Jenna. She was awesome. Super friendly, gave thoughtful recommendations, all around great customer service. She even hooked it up with her favorite pancake since we're out of towners and don't have the pleasure of experiencing Snooze whenever we please. Super cool.   I'm legitimately salty that I don't live here and probably won't be able to visit Snooze AM again for quite some time. Keep it up y'all!  Here's my overall ratings: Atmosphere- 4/5 Quality/value- 4.5/5 Food- 4.5/5 Service- 4.5/5 Coffee- 4/5",

We sat at a bar table facing the window, here you could see out front all the people moving about the area. We were instantly greeted by our server Spinsa, and she quickly returned with large mugs of coffee.  The menu appropriately features all you could want for breakfast, we both decided on eggs benedict specials. Plus, we saw their pancakes and had to split an order between us.  This place has it going on, and it is worth it. There was always a wait to be seated, but most were seated in a good time.  Great coffee, delicious breakfast, efficient and friendly service. We will return.",

There was a 45 min wait and I said first available is fine. We sat outside in the blistering heat waiting patiently. One of the servers that was outside asked us if we wanted water because he knew we had been waiting for awhile. Tons of parties kept coming and going. Then I noticed we still haven't been called so I went and checked. The girl upfront I can tell was flustered and had a attitude for me asking. When I said my name she kept looking for it and I noticed 4 parties behind us with the same amount of people were sat and had their food. That pissed me off and then to top it off a guy comes up and said well we can do first available. Funny to think I thought I was waiting for that. Then he hits me with it will another 20 more mins. I said \"again I have to wait after 45 mins\" and the girl said well there's a table outside in the corner. Clearly they don't know what first come means. We ended up getting the sweet server who offered us water and he was very quick with getting everything out in a timely manner. I would give this place more stars but after that experience it's only worth a three.",

The food was outstanding as always, but the service was pretty terrible. In fact the last time I went to the Tempe location I had the same server and thought that the service was bad, but it was very busy so I cut the guy some slack. Yesterday, however, was not busy and the service was still poor. So poor in fact my mom doesn't want to go back because of how awkward and uninviting our server was.  As I'm writing this I looked on my receipt for his name and noticed that it says: Hotline Bling. Guess that's the kind of service I should expect from a name like that.",

The Pineapple upside down pancakes are so good that every other pancake for the rest of your life will be dry and tasteless in comparison. Unless of course you can convince the chef to make you coffee and donut pancakes. Also FREAKING amazing.  The sandwich I am, three egg scramble, upstream benny (or ANY of the benny's for that matter) are slap yo mama good.  Oh and the best part? A Colorado based company!! When I moved from Denver a couple of years ago, I was devestated (no, but really, I was) that I wouldn't get to make my regular weekend stop into Snooze. And lo and behold, they came to Arizona! This is the second location in the valley. The other location is off of 20th and Camelback.

Should our first clue have been the waitress' vapid gaze or the mindless dribble of incoherent gastronomic buzzwords which burst forth like a teenager's acne? Perhaps the disengaged and mechanical affirmations to our queries and comments should have fostered more concern? Alas, I spend such little time in the presence of tweakers, I missed the early warning signs of atrocious service.  Thankfully this lackluster performance was repeated with such regularity at every interaction we came to quickly relish, in the way of a beaten animal, the trials and tribulations our brunch entailed. Our waitress' feat was only topped by the complete disinterest of her supervisor in resolving a minor billing concern. The supervisor did a brilliant job of failing to resolve our concern in any way and avoiding providing clear information to understand the concern. Such rousing leadership at Snooze's head affords the clear inspiration behind our waitress' sterling work ethic.  Our atrocious service was unfortunate for Snooze offers some truly impeccable dishes from unassuming well-seasoned hash-browns to the dare I say foodgasmic OMG French toast. Nevertheless, until such time our robot overlords automate away the humble waitress profession I must recommend forgoing Snooze's culinary delights in favor of any other establishment which values event a modicum of customer service.",

We decided to have a family brunch here and were really looking forward to trying it.  We expected it to be busy and had a great time with the kids playing ping pong and enjoying free coffee, but waiting more than an HOUR?    The staff did not come to us with the delay, so we had to go check on the hold-up and make sure we hadn't been dropped off the list.  Everyone around us was seated and eating by the time we were seated.  It then took another 20 minutes for the server to take our order.    Hubby and I realized that food wasn't likely to arrive any time soon, and decided we had to leave and grab McDonald's (yuk) in order to make our tee time!  We had a great time hanging with the family, but were so hungry by the time we arrived at the golf course that I almost lost a finger as I wolfed down a quick sandwich from the clubhouse!  We figured 2.5 hours is plenty of time to have brunch with the family before golf.  We sure got it wrong that day!    As we were walking out, I snagged the person who had brought our menus and gave her a heads-up that they may want to expedite the food order at our table as our nephew had to be at work by 2:00.  Checked with the family later to see how everything turned out and they got food quickly and everyone enjoyed it.   I would try Snooze again because the food looks delicious, but it won't be with more than one or two people next time!",

The rest of the staff was also very cheerful. Now onto the food, the orange juice is fresh squeezed and the coffee brewed to order which is not something to see a lot so that was a nice touch. I got my personal favorite, the OMG French Toast which was, you guessed it, OMFG GTFOH GOOD! Couldn't recommend it more. The sausage patty was a good taste, little bite to it that I liked.

We were seated in a table right next to the bathrooms. I usually don't have an issue with this but each time the doors swung open we caught a strong whiff of whatever was going on in there. I requested the server, very politely, for another table. She said the only options were 3 chairs at one of the communal tables or be put back on the wait list for a 20 min wait. There were tables clearing out all around us. There was no reason they couldn't have switched us to one of the other tables and given someone else our table. Very disappointed. I will explore other locations of snooze in the valley and give the Tempe location a wide berth.",

I alerted the server and she took it away immediately and said they would make me a new one. This was the chance for Snooze to shine, but nope. No manager ever came to our table to acknowledge the issue and guess what? They charged me for the dish!!   Sorry Snooze -- I was hoping for so much more from you!   Update: I heard from the business manager at Snooze right shortly after posting this. My faith in Snooze has been restored! I know mistakes happen but I am so pleased that this one has been handled as well as it has been. Thank you, Becky, for reaching out!  Snooze will have us as customers again soon.",

    "text": "first time at snooze.  This location is near downtown Tempe/mill. If you come here on the weekend, apparently the Parking Garage next door is free. Good thing to know if you're looking for a parking spot.  Pretty nice area and location. We had a group of 10, divide the group into 5 and 5 for seating, as It was a faster waiting time. It did take at least 50 minutes to an hour of waiting, and this was around 12pm.   Luckily we were seated into booth next to each other, even though it was back-to-back. Server and waitress were all friendly and pretty attentive.  For food, I had the snooze breakfast burrito. The burrito had hash brown, beans, eggs, and I decided to add in the chicken meat, which cost additional $1 or something I believe. Everything was topped off with tomatoes and their green chili sauce. What I didn't like about the burrito, was there was way too much hash brown in the burrito, which does fill you up, but I wish there was something else inside the burrito. Definitely wanted more chicken in the burrito, but maybe a few bites had a little bit more chicken.  Burrito overall was just okay, nothing special. Also the burrito was a little dry. I had to use their table green chili sauce for additional sauciness. And ketchup for the hash brown, wish I dissected it out.   But if you're hungry, the burrito will feel you up for sure. I only finished just a little over half of the burrito.  Pricing was around $13.   They do have inside and outside restroom.  Also when you are waiting, there is a person on the patio making mimosa and drinks for you while you wait. which is a nice touch. There is also a ping pong table outside.  --- I was able to try one of their pancakes as well. Not sure what type of pancake it was. But the pancake had a cinnamon / some caramel / mostly butterscotch syrup on the pancake. With a brown sugar butter cream on top. The pancake was actually pretty delicious. Would probably recommend having their sweet or pancakes, as opposed to the burrito for sure.   Also it is ridiculous that a single pancake cost $4.75.   Would I come back to snooze? If there wasn't a wait, maybe. But I will probably check out other breakfast/brunch places first before coming back to snooze. Their pancake was good though.",

No the eggs Benedict they had several also and they have an option to choose 2 different ones. I did the traditional and than the salmon. Both were really wonderful and the hash browns were great. Coffee selection was perfect had my Cortado. Not the best place for a big party they don't have large tables for more than 6 people the tables are round so not a great place for more than that.

It was SUPER packed, but we were able to get seats at their bar/communal first come first serve seating area within 15 minutes. I highly recommend doing that if you don't want to wait long. They have outdoor seating and a pingpong table with a mist sprayer which was nice for the AZ heat. Also, there's free parking in the ASU parking structure behind the restaurant.  I got my usual 3 egg white scramble with spinach, red bell pepper, and ham. I was also able to substitute the toast for a sweet potato pancake! Our server was on top of things and food came out pretty quick. Everything was cooked perfectly and they weren't skimpy with any of the toppings. The sweet potato pancake was SOOO good!! Not overly sweet, but enough to hit your sweet tooth. Pancake was nice and fluffy and big enough for the 2 of us to share.",

    "text": "The reviews are right!  While on vacation, I wanted to try out a good breakfast spot. Snooze had amazing reviews and a hefty amount of them. My boyfriend and I came early one morning and were impressed by the number of people already waiting outside in a line. We stood and waited to put our name in and were told it would be 25-30 minutes. We decided to wait because we wanted to try out the place.  Once seated, we went over the menu and had a hard time choosing! I started off with a cold brew, which was very cold and tasty. I then decided on getting the eggs benedict with hashbrowns.  The food came out very quickly and the waitress was always quick to fill up my drink. The presentation of the food looked really good. You could tell they cared about what people were seeing. I loved the fact that the hash browns were circular and looked like they used a mold to put it down on the plate. The hashbrowns were seasoned very well and the eggs benedict tasted delicious.   I would recommend everyone go, also because I'm sad I couldn't try the fun pancakes!",

We had the mmm mmm mimosa and a spicy bloody mary.  I ordered some healthier eggs Benedict with broccolini and pesto Rice and the hollandaise sauce is some kind of cream cheese yummy heavy sauce.  They have funny names for the dishes but I can't remember them all. My friend had a lighter breakfast and both were great. Server brought out hot sauce for me and the food came out quick.

A quick look on Yelp for some good eats and SnoozeAM had all the stars and solid reviews to coerce us into taking the drive into Tempe.  The line was long, wait time longer but low and behold two seats were available at the bar. We giggled with glee as we swooped in on the coveted bar stools. Immediately we were greeted and given menus, and we already knew that we were ready for our Mary's. I had a spicy Bloody Mary and my Love had the Beet Juice Mary. Different but good. More on the refreshing side. Very nice!  I ordered the egg white frittata Florentine and hubby had the \"pick two\" eggs Benedict ... chilaquiles and pulled pork. He wasn't a fan of the chilaquiles but loved the pork one.  Earlier we debated on whether or not we should split a pancake. Our server must have overheard this small debate because she came out with this amazing complimentary pecan caramel pancake for us to share!  Fifth star earned!  Menu is full of goodness and we would for sure go back!  Five stars \" brunch and beyond!\" Review for SnoozeAM!",

    "text": "Do not let the name fool you.  I am not a morning person and this place made me a happy woman from the time we sat down and throughout my day.  SEASONAL!! if they have the shrimp and grits, you MUST try it.  We're here on a mini vacation from northern California.  We've been here since Friday and have eaten out just about every meal.  We've had some great food.  But this place was the best all around we've had and we're hoping our plans can include a last breakfast before our flight in the morning.  I like to try new things but breakfast is always the classic potatoes eggs and whatever breakfast meat I'm in the mood for.  We were seated promptly (coming in after work and schools begin, my have helped with this) the decor takes you back back in time a bit but the casual and freedom dress of the staff keeps you in modern time.  Lyle (the most charming waiter ever) smiled from the time he greeted us and never stopped. He was amazing and very knowledgeable with all ingredients in the dishes we asked about.  When we asked about suggestions he recommended the shrimp and grits and the steak Benedict. They are seasonal and may not be available on our next visit down here.  Then he mentioned the pancake of the day.  Bourbon infused with  white chocolate chips pecans and.... Hmmmm he'd captured my taste buds at \"bourbon\" with maple syrup... My husband was torn on which Benedict he wanted and was thrilled about the option to choose 2 (TWO) different ones to make his meal.  I was torn between the bourbon pancake and the shrimp and grits.  I really didn't think I'd like this... (who eats shrimp for breakfast? And I never cared much for grits)... But Lyle described it so deliciously I opted for the shrimp and grits.  The  Coffee was good and HOT.  All of a sudden this golden disc of dreaminess was delivered to our table (compliments of our delightful server) THANK YOU LYLE!  You'd think this would be so rich you couldn't possibly eat more than a couple bites.  You'd guess wrong.  It was just the right amount of sweetness. Served on top of the drizzle of bourbon syrup, this treat kept its form, never got mushy and was just perfect.  Before we (yeah I shared it) were finished our food came out.  I'll let my husband rave about his Benedicts. My shrimp and grits was beautiful.  Now let's see how this tastes.  I don't get too emotional over food but this dish was Devine. The spice was perfect.  I could taste both the sweet peppers and the hot peppers.  I absolutely love that they dice all of it small.  The only big chunks was the very generous amount of shrimp that came with.  The grits ... Let's just say I will be adding them to my own breakfasts now.  The portion was just right for me as I'd even had some left over.  Oh I forgot to mention the eggs that topped it all.  It was delicious!  I'm glad I ordered out of my norm.  I wish it was morning already so I can go back and order something else.  I'm bummed Lyle won't be there but I have faith that we'll still be happy with our new favorite \"breakfast nook\"!",

I highly recommend it for anyone that loves french toast!

I have had really great service and meals here that I would rate as four or five stars, yet I have also had around the same number of experiences that were pretty awful.  If you come here on one of the good days, you can expect great breakfast food for a somewhat higher than average cost. Although, when they are on point the prices are completely worth it for the meal.   Be warned though, when they fall short of loose dining standards, your experience can be very negative. I'm not sure if they have off days or times or what, but if you are unfortunate enough to come on one of those days here is what you can expect (and what has happened to me several times now): a server whom is either incompetent or rude (they read the same sometimes), wrong or missing items when you receive your meal, undercooked or overcooked food (ex. Bacon can be slimy and transparent or burnt black and hard), an empty water and coffee cup the entire time you are there, and an overwhelming sense of dissatisfaction when you just spent $30 on a breakfast that Denny's could've put to shame for $5.   All in all, try this place out. When they do things right this place is awesome. Just be weary of those \"off\" times.",

We looked up some places on Yelp and found Snooze.    When we arrived, we were seated right away, despite the amount of guests already waiting for a table.  Our server, Lolita, was pleasant, welcoming, and made some recommendations for us.  We ordered Eggs Benedict done two ways - you get to choose 2 different Egg Benedict off their menu.  I got the Ham Benedict and the Bella Bella Benny and my wife got the Bella Bella Benny and Chile Verde Benny.  Let me say, we were blown away!!!  The Bella Bella Benny had the right balance of acidic and savory favors.  And yes, the hollandaise was very creamy and light.  Poached eggs done to perfection.  We also had the coffee and doughnuts pancake and man, that expresso syrup with the cinnamon on the doughnut shaped pancake was the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>.  You love coffee and doughnuts?  You will want to have this.  For real.  So the big surprise, was when another server came over to our table and dropped off an OMG French Toast, courtesy of our server, Lolita.  She said we've been great and wanted to have us try it.  My wife and I aren't big French Toast fans, but if there was a day to make us believers and French Toast fanatics, this was the day!!  OMG???  Yes, it earned every bit of its name.  It was fluffy and not overly sweet.  The marscapone, slices of strawberries, and the vanilla cream and salted caramel topping all just came together so beautifully.  We ate everything.  Ev-ery last bit of it.  Yum!!  We left this place with our stomachs and taste buds satisfied!!!  Great service (thank you Lolita!!!) and a nice atmosphere.  Highly recommended!!!!!",

Great menu options with a combo of traditional favorites with a twist for more modern options.  I had the OMG French toast which was amazing.  AM cocktails looked delicious, but I opted for an iced tea.   The only issue we had was navigating my friend's stroller...but it is a HUGE double stroller, so not really an issue.  Will definitely be back for more!",

To start the culinary ecstasy we tried a cinnamon roll pancake with candied pecans and cinnamon butter...holy cow!  The pancake was the perfect texture, super hot and the whole combo was the best pancake I've ever had.  My husband doesn't care for pancakes and he was blown away.  My son had the pineapple upside-down pancake and it was insanely awesome!  I had the breakfast tacos with the most delicious green chili hollandaise sauce topped with fresh cilantro and bacon...made me a breakfast believer!  My husband had the Cuban breakfast sandwich that was everything he wanted and more!  We are driving, so couldn't experience the bar drinks, but definitely will next trip.  Great coffee drinks and the whole vibe of this place was friendly, customer-oriented and amazing!  Can't wait to come back!   Well worth a trip!",

There seemed to be a super long wait (10:30am on a Sunday), but when I went to put my name on the list, I was given the option to sit immediately at the breakfast bar, the best of inside and outside; a seat in the restaurant,  fully open to the patio and street traffic. A nice spot for just the two of us, maybe not ideal for larger groups.   Our server, Kaitlyn, was awesome - super friendly and helpful. I had the spicy Bloody Mary to start. One of the best parts of the menu is the ample vegetarian offering. This time I had the Snooze Spuds Deluxe with Soyrizo and Poblano Peppers mixed in, scrambled egg added on top. Heaven! Between this and the bloody, my hangover was cured. Unfortunately, I'm plagued with an obsession over this food and can't wait to go back!!",

The vibes of this place are great for any occasion, it's really open and has a great atmosphere, they offer beer too which is a plus! The only even remotely bad thing I could say is they are really slow about bringing you iced coffee haha. And you have to park in a parking garage but it is well worth the stop in. It's just as affordable as places like IHOP or Denny's too so why wouldn't you skip them and come here instead? They never mess up a meal either.",

They had eaten and left before we even got our food. There was also a party sat a half hour after us, and while we were STILL waiting for our order, the manager went to THEIR table and said their food would be out shortly. Meanwhile, we are STILL WAITING! No table touch at our table, which was disappointing. Felt like chopped liver. The food was ok once we got it. Not steaming hot or anything, but fine. I didn't care at all for the hashbrowns. I like mine flat and crispy. I was also disapointed that there is a 3.50 upcharge to change out the toast to a pancake. Totally not worth it.   The server was sweet, but we would have liked an update on why our food took waaaaaay toooo long.  I will probably go again as they had some really interesting things on the menu that I want to try. But in no hurry to go back.",

My advice is if you see a parking space even vaguely nearby, take it.The meters take card and are cheap, but the garage next door has always been somewhere in the range of $10 cash. Blah. Onto the food! Amazing! I ordered the Snooze Continental that consists of a grapefruit brulee (a half grapefruit with caramelized sugar over the top), 2 pieces of toast and greek yogurt with house granola/drizzled honey on top! Delicious and pretty healthy too.Seriously some of THE BEST breakfast food I have had. The latte was good and the environment was nice and for being on campus, it isn't deafeningly loud like a lot of college places are. Service was great and friendly! Will return, and if I can get over the parking situation, I can see it becoming a favorite! A plus too when they didn't talk smack over my U of A card ;)",

    "text": "Snooze absolutely blew my mind:  It was a regular day that my friend and I were going to yoga.. There happened to be an ASU football game going on making it difficult to find parking. So we did what anyone would do and decided to have breakfast instead of exercise. Snooze was just starting out at that point and we didn't know what to expect. We were seated at the breakfast bar and chatting about nothing in particular when we noticed two displaced (homeless) looking people with Starbucks cups walk by outside. We really did not think anything of it until one of them seated himself next to us. We kept talking about nothing in particular when this man interrupted us and commented on my friend's sparky shirt. He asked many questions, proceeded to become accusatory and generalizing college students, making us seem brainwashed or unaware of the world, and began on an endless tirade of conspiracy-like theories. At first I was intrigued and then realized that this person would not hear logic and did not want to discuss, more of lecture. It began to get uncomfortable. He would not leave us alone. In my mind, this man could have been a paying customer so I did not expect Snooze employees to get involved, but they did. They went out of their way to ensure that our experience in the restaurant was nothing but positive, even in situations seemingly out of their control, like this.  At first a server made eye contact with my friend, my friend made the \"save me\" eyes at the server. Then, a manager approached us from one side and asked us about our day, what we knew about the restaurant, and basically distracted us pleasantly while another server approached the gentleman to our left. This server asked the gentleman to wait at the front to be seated like everyone else. The gentleman did not want to leave and insisted that we also wanted to be engaged in conversation with him. At this point we were talking to the manager about all the restaurant locations, restaurant history, etc. My friend and I addressed the gentleman and told him we would like to eat in peace and thus the confrontation was over, thanks to the manager and server.  I was so pleasantly surprised that they would take the situation in their own hands, I assumed that it was our responsibility to stand up for ourselves and tell the gentleman we were done with the conversation, after all, we are adults. I was incredibly impressed by Snooze already and would not stop raving to my friend about what great customer service that was. Then, a completely new server came by and apologized for the situation, and offered us a sweet potato pancake (it was amazing). Later, another server came by and asked us what happened and apologized and we laughed about it. Then the manager asked us if they could get us anything off of the menu and we politely declined, they've done so much for us already! Finally, we asked for the check and were ready to pay when our original server apologized for the situation and told us they covered our bill!! Like, what??!! We were so shocked and impressed and thankful that we tipped (more than we would have paid for the meal) because that's what great customer service does to you, it makes you feel things! And write novels on Yelp! And endlessly talk about a restaurant and refer all of your friends there! This entire situation was out of Snooze's control, but they made the decision to control the situation. They didn't aim for us to have a satisfactory experience, but an unforgettable one.   And to think, it all started with us not finding parking for yoga.",

The manager came over and apologized they of course took it off the bill. But even with a hair I will be back. The atmosphere is very welcoming the food is delicious and service was great. We tried a few different things on the menu. I had the snooze spuds deluxe which is literally a mountain of hash browns topped with cheese and your choice of meats. As simple as it was it was delicious. My husband had chilaquiles Benedict all I can say is AMAZING!! This is not your traditional Benedict but they nailed the flavor it's almost as good as the ones we make at home. He also had the chile verde Benny which was also delicious! Since this was a new restaurant for us we decided to go big or go home and decided to share a blueberry Danish pancake and OMG it was heavenly....had there not been a hair cooked in the middle I would have eaten it all and licked the plate clean. This place also serves alcohol and that made our brunch even better :)",

Two of us had the mimosa with grapefruit juice and St. Germain and found the drink to be very bitter. Expected the St. Germain to smooth the flavors, but not even a hint of the liquor. Given the strong bitter flavor, could be the St. Germain didn't make it into the drink. My daughter was served the wrong omelet, my fried eggs were to be over easy, but were hard rocks. Service was okay, though we had to ask a couple of times for our server. Overall, not a good introduction to the chain and will hesitate before going to any other location.",

The table to the left orders a few minutes after us. The table to the right orders a few minutes after them. We are excited because we have heard that they have some great food. 15 minutes goes by and the table to the left gets there food. About another 5 minutes goes by and the table to the right gets there food. Each table one person order the exact same thing we did ( Duel Benne). No food waiter not in sight. I finally see him and asked him about our food. He then said he will go check. He goes back into the kitchen, he comes out with some food in his hand and goes the opposite way. Then walks back to the kitchen. He walks by our table and does not say anything. After serving some drinks he walks up to us and said our food is next to be cook. At this point it has been 40 minutes. My wife said politely can we just have the check. She gets the check and he said I am sorry. My wife is generous and tips him $3.00 for nothing. The sad think is the waiter did not even try not to make a excuse for the situation. We walk out and will never go back. We then stop at the Waffle House order and got our food in 5 minutes. Now that is service.",

He got a coffee and loved it. He ended up getting one Togo too. I ordered French toast with a side of hash brown. The meal was incredibly sweet and drenched in Carmel sauce. The hashed browns were so dry and didn't have much flavor in them. The price was expensive but the restaurant was adorable and a fun place to be. The drinks were great!

    "text": "I can't believe this place is rated so high?!?! I was there for Easter, we showed up about 7:45 am. The restaurant was only about 1/3 full when we arrived, so we were excited that there was no wait. We were seated at a table very quickly when we walked in. Soon after the whole experience went in the toilet! We were seated at the very end of the restaurant furthest from the front door. This was not an issue, there were several tables that had patrons as well as the tables on both side had families. We looked over the menu and waited patiently for the server. We sat for 15 minutes before I got up to find the manager. It would have not been so bad if the servers taking care of the tables around us had at least acknowledged us. When I did get to talk to the manager I completely unloaded, I ! I went back to the table, just as a server showed up. He took our order and was trying to make things better. After a little while he showed up with a special treat to make things better, it would have been great if our food had not showed up at almost the same time. Oh wait, they took our food to the table next to us and started setting it down, as the people told them they had already eaten. To finish this long post up the food was ok but it was probably made worse because of the beginning experience. I won't be recommending the place to anyone I know, especially since we never spoke to the manager after I let him have it. He never came back over to check on us.",

I get the feeling that Snooze coasts on its great location and outdoor seating, thinking it can just mail in the rest. One of my biggest pet peeves about any restaurant...but especially one of this caliber and price point as opposed to a Waffle House or Denny's...is when an otherwise great server takes your order then hands you off to food runners who make no attempt to confirm the accuracy of orders when they're brought out, which is exactly what happened. The customer is put in the uncomfortable position of having to re-explain the order to a completely new employee oblivious to the original order, wait to eat the corrected order while everyone else digs in, and in my case eat the very dull and lack-luster final product that wasn't anywhere near worth the wait. In my case, I had breakfast tacos, featuring bland corn tortillas, barely heated and snow-white colored hash browns, and a scramble with little seasoning. It's just not what one expects of a place like this which I hold to a higher standard than Denny's or Waffle House, both of which I've eaten better (and cheaper) breakfasts at.",

My husband and I shared Juan's Tacos and a flight of pancakes consisting of Pineapple Upside Down, Blueberry & Strawberry Shortcake.  The toppings on the pancakes were all amazing, Blueberry was my favorite. The pancakes themselves were ok, I would never order them plain, they are small and something you could make at home. The tacos came on corn tortillas, we added bacon (which was done to perfection), with eggs, pico and a tasty green chile hollandaise. We added sriracha to make them even better. My only complaint about the tacos were the giant chunks of onion in the pico, they were so large it was like I asked for extra onion.  The place is super loud as many other reviews have stated, so don't expect to have intimate conversation, and it's decor is cheesy ultra-hipster.",

The server was nice, but it took forever to get our food.  The restaurant wasn't even that packed, so I could imagine if it was.  Now on to the food, which was really good and yummy, but not worth the price.  I had the OMG french toast, which costs almost 10$ by the way, and I was disappointed with the amount of food they gave me.  At the camelback snooze, I got nearly triple the food.  For 10$ I expect to not be hungry when I leave, but I guess that is the Texan in me.  Then to top it off, my wife found an eyelash on top of her pancake.  I know this kind of thing happens in the food business, but it surely made our visit less pleasant.  Overall, if you want snooze I would avoid this one and go to the one in Phoenix instead.",

    "text": "We went on a Sunday morning around 8:30am and waited an hour for a table outside for 5 plus a high chair. The wait wasn't that bad. There was enough space to sit out front and they sent you a text once your table is ready. We didn't get our food until 10am. I ordered the tacos. The menu said it came with a sauce, but there was no sauce on the plate. I didn't say anything. I just wanted to eat. It was really good food. We sat right next to the condiments, so we didn't have to ask for much help. We asked for a cup of ice and didn't get it until we got the check. The hashbrowns are really crispy and flavorful. Everyone's food looked really good. There was a lot of color on the plate. I ordered a side jalapeno and it was hot! Be careful! We all finished our meals and didn't offer to share! I would go back again, but on a weekday. Be careful with the cutlery. My knife had dried food on it. I didn't need it, so I didn't ask for another one.  Go early with people you can talk to for hours without eating much before hand. Invite me along! I need to find more people I can be around before I've had breakfast!",

The menu is too vast to order just one thing but my waiter, Phil, hooked me up with some recommendations. I ended up getting the breakfast burrito, but Phil knew I was struggling with that decision. He therefore took it upon himself to send out a mammoth pancake on the house. His service was outstanding and the food was unbelievably delicious!!",

My boyfriend and I visited for breakfast and it wasn't too busy so we were seated right away - it's a pretty big place. We opted for seats at the counter by the window so we could stare outside (and we had a good view of the ping pong table, which was entertaining.)  I ordered the late harvest benny which is sweet potato polenta topped with more sweet potatoes, eggs, fennel and kale and served with hashbrowns. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast pot pie. We both really enjoyed our choices. I love the combination of the sweet potato polenta with the eggs paired with the hashbrowns. Plus, the cream cheese hollandaise gave a nice sweet balance to this savory dish. All mixed together it made for a tasty breakfast hash. And it was very filling.  Overall I really liked the atmosphere, the service was good and the food was yummy. It will be great to go here when it's nice enough to open up the large windows.",

The service staff is the best especially when seated at the bar, you get casual and attentive service and the managers usually swing by to say hey and make sure life is good.  Check out the daily pancake because usually it's the most creative and legit inspiration to start your day.",

Despite my flaky friend not showing up I decided to stay. It was a cloudy day and a little chilly so I ordered a hot almond milk latte. (I love places that offer more than the normal milk n soy options.) One of the staff members was very willing to turn on one of the outside heaters for me. Almost immediately after ordering my Latte it started raining. They rapidly put up the umbrellas in an attempt to keep my pooch and I dry. This is when i received several drama filled phone calls and stirred up emotion for me. I was crying, wet, and had a miserable dog. I got my latte to go.   I am writing this review Because of the great smiling service I received. I had multiple check ins by several different staff members. They truly did everything they could. Thanks guys- keep up the good work.   Can't wait to try your food.",

The variety of eggs benedict are extensive and they are tasty, the best part is you can mix and match them so that makes decision making a bit easier.  Try the Chili Verde and the Late Harvest.  No bike racks yet but there are some down the street. If that is something you are interested in, tell the management, the more demand the better.",

I ordered the corned beef hash and my friend had the snooze deluxe. We didn't get any drinks. The food was great and we both liked the layout of the place.

Which was surprising considering how packed the place was. We had OMG! french toast, breakfast tacos, Huevos Rancheros, Breakfast pot pie...everything was sooooooooooo good! Then the waitress brought over the biggest pancake (for free) for us to try. It was THE BEST pancake any of us have ever had...hot, fluffy, great flavor. This place is worth the wait!",

I'm a big fan of their blue berry danish, pineapple upside down, and their sweet potato pancakes, it is really worth the calories. Since I don't eat red meat anymore, I order from their light menu which is the egg whites and greens, very good and lots of veggies!  This place is good for big groups but man if you are really starving and can't wait about 20-45 minutes in line, then go somewhere else, but again you have to try their pancakes! They can get really packed in the morning and it doesn't matter what day of the week they are just always busy. I think for two people we paid 30 dollars.",

It was finished with a generous drizzle of cream cheese frosting, and a pat of cinnamon butter on top.  My partner had the Cocoa Pancakes with a seared marshmallow on top, and a side of melted chocolate (in lieu of syrup). He loved it. He also ordered a beautuful side of fruit which looked fresh.   DRINKS: I started with a cherry mimosa-like drink which was ok, but the Bloody Mary was very tasty. It had a nice amount of spice. He started with a grapefruit mimosa and finished with a different mixed drink that he appeared to enjoy.  SERVICE: Attentive, accurate, friendly, and prompt.  PARKING: A parking garage which is $3 an hour is just steps away. I don't know if weekends are always free, but it was free when we visited.  We dined during what, presumably, is one of their busiest periods (Sunday Brunch). Everything was spot-on. We're definitely going back!",

What does get me excited though is the Breakfast Pot Pie. The rich gravy perfectly compliments the flaky puff pastry with your choice of eggs and a side of hash browns.

I take bacon super seriously, if it was acceptable to eat it every single day, I totally would.   My husband found Snooze through yelp and we gave it a go this past Friday. It's located right near ASU campus and a couple of blocks from our hotel, it was a good thing we walked considering the amount of dishes we put away. Lol  Upon arrival, there was about a 10 minute wait, the place was packed at noon. I'm pretty sure this particular location takes reservations but I'm not a 100% sure.   We were seated promptly after a tiny bit of wait and decided on the Pancake Flight ($10.25) and the Snooze Spuds Deluxe ($12). The Pancake Flight gives you a choice of any of the pancakes available- my fella chose the Pineapple Upside Down pancake, a traditional blueberry pancake and the Pancake of the Day- the Tropic Thunder (I think it was called) Holy crap were the pancakes delicious! The PUD pancake had chunks of pineapple in it and a small scoop of cinnamon butter, the Blueberry pancake was way better than standard with tons of fresh blueberries mixed into the batter, I can't remember what was in the Tropic Thunder pancake but I think there was coconut in it and topped with fresh blueberries and raspberries with an icing like topping- the Tropic Thunder was my least favorite but that's not saying much since it was just too tough to go up against the PUD pancake and the Blueberry.   Then there was the Snooze Spuds Deluxe. It's a dish of hash browns I ordered crispy with your 2 choices of protein- I chose the chorizo and bacon all topped with shredded cheese and 2 eggs over easy. This dish was by far the best breakfast plate I've had- I'm pretty sure ever, it was so damn good. The bacon was perfectly crisped and the chorizo was perfectly seasoned and added a nice savoriness to the dish. Get it, you will not be disappointed!  I think in the excitement of the first 2 dishes we placed in order to try the corned beef hash ($10.75) and eggs. This dish was good but really nothing about it stood out, so that was a bit of a bummer. There was a ton of onions in the hash and not enough hash and that was off.   We didn't try any of the cocktails this time around but I would love to someday. We loved this place so much that my fella almost ran out to grab breakfast again early Saturday morning before we were due at the airport. It's a good thing we didn't we might've missed our flight. Lol   My husband discovered there's a location in Tustin so we will happily be back next time we're in SoCal!",

With this, you get 3 different pancakes so I love to try the new one each day.   Be aware that lines can be 45+ wait on weekends or any busy days and more for bigger groups. The food is absolutely worth it and they have anything you could want! I recommend going during the week if you can and call ahead if you don't want to wait to see if you are willing to wait for x minutes.",

I ordered the Horse and Sidecar Bloody Mary as well, & that was the only downfall. It was very flavorful, but just a little too much horseradish, making it hard on the stomach.

The first time, I got a benny duo with the traditional (dat hollandaise was amazing) and the verde pulled pork (also gr8). The second time, I got the pancake flight. There was a sweet potato pancake which was not my thing but the blueberry danish pancake was amazing and delicious and next time, I am getting just that probably. The menu is diverse and great and expensive but I think brunch is worth spending big bucks on so I recommend it to all my fellow brunch lovers.",

Visited the Tempe location with a friend and was not disappointed. We got chilaquiles benedict, salsa verde benedict, OMG french toast & a PB cup pancake. For starters - WAY too much food for two people but, we're gluttons for punishment and breakfast foods so we stuffed ourselves into oblivion. The sweet eats are always my favorite - but the benedicts were damn good too. The chilaquiles was my favorite of the two.  Only downside is the wait times are almost always SO. LONG. But, that's a sign of a good place, no? We put in for two and were told about a 30-45 min wait, which is pretty standard around late Sunday brunch time. They serve coffee in the standing area while you wait though, so that's a nice occupier. However, if bar top seating comes open it's first come first serve and we scooped up two spots about 15 minutes into the wait. Scoooooore! It's also located on campus, so take that for what it's worth - we figured it would be filled with boozing college kids (because you know, we're SO old & far removed from that lifestyle in our late 20's ha!), but it wasn't at all an issue.   Eat the pancake flight. Get the AM Manhattan. Then go home & take a nap.",

I saw my waitress twice -- once during the order and once during the bill. She never came to check up or refill the water. I had to ask someone else. The portions are pretty small for what you pay for, or at least what I got ..it was just a black of hash browns and 2 ham benedicts. It was not too filling.",

Our group did both sweet (pancake flights-- both highly recommended the Drunken Punk'n option) and savory (Havana Daydreaming and B.E.A.T. Sammies). The food was fantastic. Delicious OJ and coffee. Only complaint was that food delivery was slow.  I started to wonder if someone forgot to fire our order given the number of guests that arrived at the same time or after us that not only received their orders but also finished them before we were served. Our server handled it well though and had plenty of time to get to our tour. Will definitely visit again when looking for food in Tempe.",

    "text": "Go Cubs Go!!!   First of all, a lot things went right with this place. For starters they have a really nice patio area overlooking part of ASU. In addition to that they have a nice ping pong table and bean bag game out there as well.   The joint is right on ASU campus in Tempe with some additional restaurants in the surrounding area. Came here on a nice warm sunny Wednesday morning in November with my cousin for breakfast. I ordered three eggs with chicken sausage and hash browns and substituted toast for an upside down pineapple pancake.I will have to say that the pancake was a good size for being a single and oh yeah it tasted awesome! The eggs and chicken sausage were nice and hot the way a great breakfast should be.  As I was enjoying my breakfast I realized how much this place reminded of a breakfast place that I frequent in the Chicago suburbs named Jam N' Jelly. Snooze AM had the same awesome feel to it with the exception of having much nicer November weather than Chicago...duh right?  In addition to all the greatness mentioned above I picked up really quick on how a few of the servers there were wearing Chicago Cubs shirts and that right there earned them an extra star!  If you happen to be in the ASU area and are looking for a great, friendly, tasty breakfast place that has outside dinning, a long side a cool ping pong table, and bean bag game. Then I highly recommend this place and definitely go for some of the specialty pancakes they have on their menu.",

    "text": "If you take away one thing from this review let it be: PANCAKES.  Inside the restaurant the music is extremely loud plus the abundance of chatter makes it very difficult to hear your brunch mates. Perhaps that makes me sound old, but I don't get to see these guys all the time so when I do I'd like to be able to converse with them.   Sitting outside isn't really much of an option in the summer either. There didn't appear to be much shade or misters to try to beat the heat so unless you enjoy becoming a melted burnt mess inside you go.  The service was alright, but the servers definitely seem overwhelmed with the crowd of people. We barely saw the poor thing who was busy running around. Did I mention the place was slam packed? 'Cause it was. That being said the wait time to get in was only about 20 mins.   I wasn't overly impressed with the food I ordered. My potatoes were not crisp. (I like my hash browns to have a crispy seer.) Also, there were some gross soggy pieces of bacon fat in my dish. I took the most of it home and reheated it in a skillet with some butter and that did turn out delicious.   The pancakes are where it is at though! We split a pancake flight and I have to say all 3 different kinds were fantastic! They were light and fluffy and full of flavor. They each were so good individually I don't think I could even pick one favorite of the bunch. I highly recommend trying the ones we had: Strawberry Fields, Blueberry Danish and Peanut Butter Cup. I have a feeling the rest of the pancakes and the french toast are probably equally was tasty as well.   Oh yeah, did I mention the pancakes? Get the pancakes!!",

The Bella Bella Benny feeds my constant craving to throw arugula on everything. The great thing is I can have one of each. Choices abound!   The staff here is friendly.

It came in a milk glass semi hot ( were a mug would have kept it much hotter). I was told a child's comes in the mug. There was no mention in the menu of that. Next you could have whip cream on it. That was good but there was no mention of cinnamon being sprinkled on it. For me it didn't taste good and was again let down.  I did not send it back but did tell the server how they could improve it for the next customer that order it.  For warn ask how a simple drink is made before ordering it.",

Onions, ham and mushrooms for me. I should've put some sort of their sauce on it. However, it was delicious either way. I can't believe they have a caramel apple mimosa! Um what!? It was sweet and delicious and tasted like a caramel apple.   Everything was great, and the service was good. It took about 30 minutes for us to get a table though, and they don't take reservations.",

We ordered the pancake flight-- blueberry, french toast and pineapple upside down cake. Although we did ask for one plain pancake. So idk how that happened but score for us. We also ordered the breakfast pot pie w hash-browns. I was kind of sad that I saw the OJ coming from a container after I was already drinking mine.  I immediately dug into the pot pie, the gravy was more of a cool temperature. I had my friend try it too to make sure I wasn't being overly critical, or maybe gravy comes cool? Anyway Savannah came back a little later, I told her \"I think this is supposed to be warmer than this?\" She immediately said she would have them remake it. Round two came out and this time it was at least warm in some areas. My only suggestion is to make the gravy hotter or make it from scratch when its ordered. The pancakes and french toast were BOMB! I loved the blueberry the most.  Every employee said a parting greeting as well. I thought that was a really nice touch. Ill be back and this time I'm ordering the Chilaquiles.",

If you are worried about parking there is a public parking garage just right next to Snooze, however they do not validate parking, so you will have to pay, I didn't mind because it meant easy parking and no having dig for change for parking meter, or feeding the parking meter my credit card info.   It was a Wednesday morning and I was in the mood for breakfast so I grabbed my son and daughter, who happen to both be home, which is rare and told them lets head off to breakfast.   I went with the Chiaquiles Benedict, barbacoa beef over tortillas in ranchero sauce, melted cheese, poached eggs, roasted pobalno hollandaise sauce, Pico de Gallo & cotija cheese with a chocolate chip pancake.  I have to say these are some of the best tasting benedicts I have had in a while, I just loved all the flavors and textures, and the hollandaise sauce is what makes this dish blend perfectly.  The Chocolate chip pancake was great too, just what the little kid inside me was craving, fluffy, and chocolaty good!   My daughter and son loved there dishes as well, and my son was surprised that I knew about Snooze, sometimes I think he doesn't know me at all haha.   Another great breakfast at Snooze!",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Really surprised by the nearly 5-star review.  Ignoring the spotty service that we received, I give this place a 2.5-star rating, not needing extraordinary measures to come back but really, really hesitant to.  And that's just based on the food.  Ordered the Benny Duo with a ham and chile verde benedict.  Also ordered a side of bacon, chicken sausage, a side of eggs, and a chocolate chip pancake.  The Benny Duo comes with a side of hash browns.  They have apparently changed the way they serve has browns here.  They used to be scattered on the grill, now they come from a cylindrical mold.  Makes for more space on the flattop to cook other stuff, but also leads to no crispiness at all in the hash browns.  The top of my hash browns were just barely browned and what was in the middle was cooked through but on the mushy side.  The side of bacon was marginally saved by the fact that they use well-sourced, thick-cut bacon - but not crisped at all.  Limp and greasy all the way through except the last bite of the last piece.   The ham benedict was superior to the chile verde.  The chile verde comes with pulled pork on a tiny stack of green chile tortillas.  Very little green chile flavor coming through.  The pulled pork was moist but lacked flavor.  To their credit, both eggs were well poached.  The ham benedict would have been pretty perfect but for the hollandaise, which was way too thick and lacked tanginess/citrus.  I'm sure that sauce will never break but it's not a good hollandaise.  My wife was also disappointed with her chicken sausage (which is a patty, not in a casing) and her chocolate chip pancake, and I concur.  Pancake was not fluffy, lacked butter, with the chocolate chips being the only thing going for it.  And they would have been better off serving a pounded out piece of chicken breast instead of the chicken sausage patty that they served - which had marginally more flavor and was dry.  A paillard wouldn't have required them to grind down chicken meat in the first place and it would probably taste better.    The atmosphere is quite nice, it's trendy, and staff was friendly - but that didn't make up for the mediocre food that got.  Again, 2.5 stars, would have been showing 3 if service were more even.",

Delicious, the flavors between the meats and sauces are not too sharp and they compliment eachother very well. The fruit juices and alcoholic drinks are great. Stay away from the dirty drunken chai. Very disappointing chai flavor imitation. The dark coffee flavor overpowers the rest of it and it's not topped with anything to snap it up. Breakfast burritos are very dull and the sauces don't help unless you have dull tastebuds, so make sure to add a favorable meat to help a little. The staff are AMAZING! Incredibly friendly and eager to please. Spencer gave great insight. Definitely something for everyone here. BEST OF ALL, Dog Friendly patio!",

They had complimentary coffee and allow you to go to the bar to get drinks while you wait but you cant sit at the bar as other patrons are eating there. The atmosphere is chill with a great outdoor patio with FUNCTIONAL MISTERS.   FOOD: We both ordered the same dish with only one difference. We had the Snooze Spud Deluxe with bacon and sausage. My wife has scrambled eggs and I had Poached Soft eggs (done well). Our server Nick was attentive and knowledgable about the menu. He asked us where we were from and we told him Texas. We told him that we were here for our 1 year anniversary. He allowed us to get the Sweet Potato Pancake on the house. OMG, that darn pancake was so Soft and buttery. IT LITERALLY MELTED IN OUR MOUTHS.   DRINKS: I had a Brewmosa which was delightful for an early morning kick off and my wife had a Mmm Mmm Mimosa which was a great classic one, kind of light on the champagne but still good none the less.  Next time we are in town we will be back",

The mimosas were good, hard to screw that up, but our server was pretty aloof and  my sister had to literally flag him down to let him know he forgot to order hers. My dish was good not great, and my sisters (marscapone?) pancakes were way too sweet and rich.  I think there are way better brunch places in Tempe and you won't have to deal with paying for parking (they don't validate) or long waits.",

We had been waiting for almost an hour for a table (you can expect this if you come any time before 11:30 a.m. on a weekend), and when we were seated, the manager comped us a \"pancake flight\" with three full-size Snooze specialty pancakes - just as a thank you for waiting! My group inhaled them faster than I could snap a picture, but they were incredible. Service is always great here - you can tell that the servers and hosts really enjoy their jobs, and it's a fun and quirky place to be!",

    "text": "If you love breakfast food, Snooze is the place for you. Familiar with their restaurants, I first visited one of the Snooze eateries in San Diego.  When I found out there was one in Tempe, I told my friends that we had to eat there while we were in town on a work trip.  Three of us showed up around 7:30am on a Sunday and there was no wait at all, but I didn't expect there to be that early which is why we showed up when we did.  From past experiences at the other Snooze I'd been to, I knew the place would be packed before too long, especially on a Sunday.  I knew I wanted a pancake flight for the variety. You can order any 3 flavors available for $9.75. I chose the Bourbon Street Pumpkin, Blueberry Danish, and Chocolate Chip. The guys both got the Breakfast Pot Pie with rosemary sausage gravy, puff pastry, egg, and hash browns.  After getting a taste of this, I wish I'd ordered it, too, because it was amazing!  Not that I was disappointed with my pancakes at all.  I especially liked the Blueberry Danish one. My tip for Snooze is get there early or expect a wait and share your meal with your loved ones so you can try more good eats.",

That salsa that comes with the Huevos Rancheros was god awful and wouldn't even qualify as salsa in the bottom most pits of hell. Lastly somehow this place manages to screw up ketchup, with some devil brand of ketchup I've never heard of before that is fantastically bad.  In conclusion, Avoid upon pain of death.",

They actually offer the eggs Benedict that way singly can order two different types.  I recommend the Chile Verde Benedict and the Bella Bella but if your a potato lover the Snooze spuds are awesome either the pulled pork and jalapenos.  Never a bad meal here.",

My boyfriend had the OMG French toast which was delicious, but it was just thrown on the plate. I had the sandwich I am, which was a HUGE piece of sausage, and egg. But there wasn't a whole lot of flavor outside of that. The pretzel roll it came on wasn't that great, and it needed a lot more cheese. Our waiter was really attentive to the people next to us, but kind of glossed over us. I had to get condiments myself after waiting 15 minutes for him to come back! But, I really enjoyed the free coffee idea while you wait. It's a super cute place, and I really love the feeling of the place but overall, it was just okay.",

The hostess told us that it would take 15-20 minutes. We get a text saying that our table is almost ready. 45 minutes in, we ask them about our table, since others who came after us are getting seated before us. The manager(?) goes and tells the hostess that it will take longer than 15-20 minutes for people to be seated, but after he walks away, she continues to tell people it will be a 15-20 minute wait. We sit down, and by now, we're starving and really angry that we're going to miss the REI garage sale because of the situation. No one comes over to help us for a few minutes and we watch as one of the employees stands around flirting with a table full of college girls next to us. The girl who ends up taking our order rarely checks on us and I don't think we ever saw her smile. What a strange experience.",

Their sweet potato pancakes are to die for and so is their French toast. Don't mind the wait! It's only proof of how good the food is. Service rocks, too!",

    "text": "I was looking for a good pancake spot so I invited some friends to join me at Snooze for early breakfast. As a newer location, the decor resembled their other restaurants. The signatory yellow light fixtures corresponded with a good number of round tables. The structure also facilitated a row of stools facing the large windows, and a full bar in the back. By extension, the sidewalk patio added character and spaciousness to the restaurant. Fortunately, we arrived early enough and did not have to wait for a table.  The Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup ($7.50) came with a conventional bread and cheese sandwich, tomato soup, and hash brown. There was a light crunch on the bread, but not enough cheese to translate into that gooey experience I was looking for. For the price, I was expecting better value and taste on the sandwich. The tomato soup was rich, hearty, and had a slight kick in the end. The hash brown was soft and needed more crispy edges. It was not the best grilled cheese, but it did hit the spot.  The Pancake Flight ($9) came with our choice of blueberry pancake, sweet potato pancake, and the chocolate ganache pancake. All three of us agreed the sweet potato pancake was the most impressive, as the buttermilk and caramel flavors accompanied a touch of ginger butter and handfuls of pecans tossed on top. The server endorsed the blueberry pancake, but it tasted rather conventional. I wished there were wholesome blueberries embedded, and that these pancakes were easier to cut into. The dark chocolate ganache concoction was without depth and the least impressive.  Service was very sporadic and not warm or welcoming as I expected of breakfast places. Overall, the food were nowhere close to the experience I previously had at their sister restaurants. The food hit the spot but there was no wow factor whatsoever. Additionally, I thought the execution on the Grilled Cheese was very poor for the price and a restaurant of this caliber. The server also gave approval to a blueberry pancake that was rather sub par. Overhyped. I will not be coming back.",

The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that they sent out an omelette when I'd ordered a scramble and had to wait about 10 min to get the correct order. Otherwise the food was delicious (albeit a cold pancake that sat while I waited for the rest of the food to come out).  I always get the pineapple upside down pancake (gluten-free). It's the best pancake they have IMO. Also (eventually) got the egg scramble with goat cheese, spinach and mushrooms. I could have done without the hashbrowns. I tried just get the pancake instead of the toast and hashbrowns which I think is a fair trade out, but apparently you have to pay an additional $4 for the pancake whether you want to trade out both or just one of them (which doesn't make sense to me, but oh well).  Their lattes are good. I asked for a latte with almond milk and a little honey and cinnamon. It was delicious.",

Had to wait for my check after leaving my credit card on the counter for nearly 10 minutes. He's capable of good service because he even gave these girls free pancakes!

We split an Eggs Benedict order...which was encouraged as they allow you to order any two from the options. My husband ordered a chilequile version and I ordered a ciabatta, prosciuttobalsamic yummy benedict. Divine! Both. Sauce and eggs were perfect. Then we odered \"dessert\"...cause we do this. It was a donut pancake with cinnamon apples, chai glaze, candied walnuts and espresso syrup. The coffee was wonderful. Service exceptional. Outdoor dining perfect. Clean bathroom. GO EAT HERE!",

It was good though wary since the meat was prosciutto.  Other party members had the Ham Benedict III and Juan's Breakfast Tacos.  We arrived early at 9:15 amenity a 30 minute wait, we were told. The wait was much longer and they lost new business  and the restaurant next door received those customers. There is complementary coffee while you wait which is a major plus!    The food was very tasty and we'd definitely return! I had the option to substitute pancakes for the hash browns for a $3.50 surcharge. That's quite a hefty substitute fee!",

The corned beef might have been a little too lean - My daughter thought her grilled cheese was excellent - Reasonably priced, but the portions (for a breakfast place) were a little on the small side",

They definitely boast a different menu of the classics without adding fresh mountain alpine arugula or southeastern Cuban coast seaweed to every dish. (Refreshing in a time where people are trying to hard sometimes.)   Atmosphere is very fun and friendly. We experienced a theme day the Sunday we went. It was beach day so the servers were wearing floaties and sunscreen noses. Very nice touch.   Service was phenomenal. Very good team effort/vibe, coupled with quick, attentive service and thorough but timely check backs from our server. It was a small 10 minute wait but this was the off college season. Throw in free weekend covered structure parking right next door and it's well worth it.",

I was told it would be a 20 minute wait but was seated in 10 - hooray! However, I do not like their \"text\" feature for alerting you when your seat is ready. At all. I much prefer the traditional method of calling out your name... Anyway, was seated and greeted by my waitress promptly, but it became apparent over the course of my visit that she was very overwhelmed. There was not an empty table the entire time I was in the restaurant. If I were a waiter there, I'd be overwhelmed too. It took quite a long time for my friend and I to get our \"specialty\" order drinks - chai tea - and it was not very good. Extremely bland and at $4 a glass, I had hoped for more. The French toast was delicious but the serving size was small for the price. My water was only refilled once and I left the restaurant very thirsty. All in all, I'd go back. I really would. But not on a weekend morning when the wait staff is too busy to refill drinks.",

    "text": "As an ASU student, I've gone to Snooze many times during my 4 years of college. I may even have skipped class once or twice to feast on Snooze...but that's our little secret.   This past weekend, I re-visited with some friends in a group of 7. We checked in around 9am on Saturday and were seated ~15-20 min later, which was surprising, as I've waited 30+ minutes for 2 people before! They have a main menu and then rotating pancake/holiday options which makes it fun to return again and again. The cost is average for brunch place in Tempe at $11-13 per plate, but you definitely fill up!  This time, I ordered the sweet potato hash from the \"Like a feather\" section. I had no idea what the Gochujang sauce was, and I was nervous that it would be a hot sauce when they brought it out, but it's actually pretty tasty! Not spicy at all. More sweet. I felt full and satisfied without being bloated after my meal. Sweet potatoes aren't technically Keto/low carb, but this was still a great, healthy alternative!  Parking: there is metered street parking spaces across the street, or there is the Fulton parking garage which is free on weekends!   Venue: Snooze is a trendy, retro themed restaurant. The workers wear casual clothes with different Snooze graphic tees. It's very casual! If you have to wait, which is very likely, there are only a couple seats inside by the hostess stand. Most people stand outside, but they text you when your table is ready either way. I personally like to sit at the tables across the street until I get my text!",

The menu has a nice selection and some cocktails. I had a grapefruit mule that was fantastic. The waiter brought the puppies some bacon. So sweet.   My friend got the Benedict and it looked amazing and she loved it. I had the breakfast tacos. Wow very good!    I'd recommend it if you're in the area and the patio weather is good.",

Very flavorful, not too crunchy, not too soft, perfect! I have also tried their Ham Benedict before. I LOVED it. I've tried eggs Benedict at other brunch restaurants to compare, and honestly nothing compares to the Benedict's at Snooze. I highly recommended coming here. There is always a wait, but it is worth it every time!",

    "text": "Had the worst experience here. I have a dairy allergy, so I ordered my Chili Verde Benedict without cheese. When they brought out our food, there was cheese melted in between the tortillas, but I didn't know until after I took a bite. I could taste it, so I lifted up the tortilla and there was very obviously cheese underneath. Called the waitress over and she began to argue that there was no cheese on it. I was shocked and just decided not to eat the tortillas. I was hungry because the place was busy and service was slow, so I just decided not to fight it and just eat everything but the tortillas.   Somehow the manager found out and came over and talked to us. He offered to remake it and comp my meal. I was so pleased with how it was handled until the food came out. They literally just took the food I had already started to eat and put it on top of two soggy, cold English muffins. It was so awful that I didn't even eat them and they basically just wasted time that I could have been eating.   At this point, I was just done. I felt like I couldn't complain now because I was getting the meal for free. I discourage everyone from going here.",

Upon asking, the server recommended a delicious sweet potato hash and even suggested to add some corn tortillas (highly recommend doing this), others had the breakfast burrito and pancakes.  All were large portions and kept us full all day.  We drove from Tempe to Sedona, hiked for several hours and didn't eat again until almost 8 hours later.  The second visit I wanted a pancakes but I didn't want only pancakes so I had the hash again (yes it's really that good) and ordered a flight of pancakes for the table.  I must say that the flight of pancakes is really a must have.  Our waitstaff was amazing both times.  Great vibe, clean, efficient, friendly.  Highly recommend.",

We also received a starter pancake called \"Sinful\" something but isn't on the menu. It's made with white chocolate chips, cinnamon butter, bacon/pork belly, pecans and a syrupy glaze. OMGeee we couldn't stop eating it - it was heavenly! See individual food reviews below - we also got bloody mary's: Spicy made with habanero + jalapeno vodka and Boss Hog made with bourbon. Both were great, but I will choose a \"standard\" spicy BM over any kind of \"wild\" BMs. We would recommend this place again and again for anyone who loves a really good breakfast!   Chili Green Verde Benedict: loved the pulled pork and barbacoa with verde sauce and pico de gallo....I could eat it every morning. I couldn't even finish my hash browns, but the small amount I did eat were cooked to perfection.    Bella! Bella! Benedict: fresh, nice twist on the standard benedict, eggs were farm-fresh and excellently poached.",

The food was delicious, especially the bacon which was thick cut and amazing and they had these really good sausage patties.The scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly, light and fluffy.

The chicken sausage I get every time I eat at Snooze because its too flavorful and hearty to pass on.

I had the sweet potato pancakes and it was not at all what I was expecting. I decided to try their regular pancakes and they also fell flat.  My friend had the break pot-pie but the eggs seemed way too gooey for my taste. I guess I will pass on Snooze from now on and just go next door.",

I've heard a lot about this place and after going here for the first time, I understand exactly why it's so popular and why it has such a high rating on Yelp.   I came here at noon on a Saturday and it was move-in weekend for ASU, so it was pretty packed. Regardless, I was able to get a table in about ten minutes, so I didn't have to wait very long at all. Score!  The service was pretty good. My waitress was attentive and friendly, so nothing bad there.   What I especially love about this place is the variety of sweet and savory. Going into a breakfast spot is really difficult for me because I never know what to get and this place had it all! They also had about five or six different types of eggs Benedict, which I feel like is unheard of! I went with the Bella Bella Benny and it was DELICIOUS! Their hashbrowns are seriously so good too. The iced hazelnut latte really hit the spot too, plus they offer dairy substitutes (soy or almond milk).   All in all this place is fantastic. The Camelback location is more convenient for me but I'd happy return to the Tempe location! If you do, be prepared to pay for parking in either a garage or using a meter. As far as I know, Snooze doesn't validate parking.",

The worst part; we found a piece of PORK(?) in his TOFU scramble? We showed the waitress, who walked away and avoided the issue entirely. Why have tofu and soy products of your going to just cook it where meat, and meat grease is? Disgusting. I definitely won't be going back.

Luckily my friend ordered the eggs Benedict two ways so I was able to taste test those and was delighted with the corned beef hash I ordered for myself. Fresh ingredients, friendly and attentive service.  Get there early if you're starving. I arrived around 945 AM and waited 15 mins to be seated...not too bad considering the line was out the door by 10 AM.",

It's right on ASU's campus so many college students can come here. If you're in the mood for sweet pancakes, it's a good place. Any other type of home cooked breakfast food is a no.",

I am so glad I never got to have my first time experience at Snooze in Denver because I don't know if they would have been able to live up to the hospitality I received at the Tempe location.    The food was remarkable. Absolutely delicious. I sat at the bar and the servers Adrianne & Tori were fantastic. They even brought us a peanut butter cup pancake on the house! I am a pancake fanatic so this made my dining experience that much more enjoyable!   Two thumbs way up for Snooze! I will most definitely be back.",

We dropped our daughter off at the airport on a Sunday morning and was looking for a place to have breakfast- The food is great and the service was incredible...Right down next to ASU campus. This is not your typical eggs and bacon food- They take the basics and step it up with the presentation! So if you aren't willing to wait you will be sorry...you won't find this food in any other breakfast joint.",

I also ordered the BEAT sandwich, and the bacon tomato aioli was to die for. The ciabatta bread was nice and soft, and overall it was delicious. My all time favorite pancake is the sweet potato one. Whenever I bring someone new there, I force them to try it and they never regret it. If you prefer french toast, I highly recommend the OMG French Toast because it is amazing.",

I found the presentation excellent but I took two issues with the meal. First, the ham was dry and didn't cut easily with a knife. Second, it was a little light on the hollandaise sauce, which makes or breaks the entire dish itself.  A co-worker ordered French Toast and side of bacon. Both were on point!",

    "text": "Ordered 2 breakfast burritos -   One of them had ranchero sauce which taste basically like tomato paste - no flavor at all, no spice at all.   The other was ordered with green chile - equally lacking in flavor but better than the ranchero.   The green chile burrito was also ordered with avocado, a 2.50 cost, and there was no avocado present in the burrito at all.   Both burritos contained more black beans than any other ingredient - there were maybe 1-2 scrambled eggs in each burrito but how could you taste the egg when every bite contained mostly black beans?  Both burritos had hashed Browns in them, however, my definition of hash browns is crispy fried potato strings and these were virtually raw sliced potatoes with not a single bit of brown showing on them.   For my total cost being 16.50 for the green chile burrito and about 13 for the ranchero this is just a huge huge waste of time and money. I could have eaten at Chelsea's kitchen and had an amazing chilaquiles with breakfast mimosas for the same price and been far far happier.  Honestly this is the biggest most overhyped breakfast restaurant I've encountered with prices that are on par with a resort and food on par with a high school cafeteria.   Save your time and money and go elsewhere.",

They told us the wait would be 30 minutes, we waited over double this. It took over an hour. The thing that particularly frustrated me is that toward the end of my wait, I watched two people just waltz in in front of us. Apparently they had some open bar seating available that was first come first serve, and no one mentioned to us that this was an option.  By the time I got to my seat I was a little annoyed, but the menu looked good and after the wait I really wanted to enjoy myself. The server took our order, and literally never came back. Someone else brought out the food, and we practically had to beg the guy to take our money since he had evidently forgot we were there.  To add fuel to the fire, neither of our meals were good. I wouldn't say it was awful, but it definitely wasn't anything worth going back for. The food was plain and cooked poorly. I was really disappointed in the entire experience and won't be going back.",

We ended up waiting about 30-35 minutes and Adrian, the manager, made sure we were compensated for that by giving us 2 complimentary pancakes. Adrian was great, she wasn't our server but she was still very attentive. We were greeted and served by about  5 different very friendly people can't even remember all of the names.  The food was phenomenal. Hubby got a benne duo, one late harvest and one chilaquiles. The beef barbacoa on the chilaquiles was tender and had wonderful flavor, and the late harvest was full of delicious fall veggies and was on top of a smooth creamy grit cake. My pancake flight were the best 3 pancakes I've ever had in life. Drunkn punkn, sweet potato, and the pancake of the day was buttermilk with Bacon pieces inside topped with strawberries and nutella sauce and marscapone! So along with the pineapple upside down and blueberry danish which were complimentary, I tried 5 different flavors of deliciousness. They were all great. Bottomless cup of coffee and really good lemonade too. Nothing to complain about on the food.",

There isn't anything filling about it and the gravy was skimpy at this location. After cleaning my plate I left unsatisfied. It's a clever dish, just not dialed-in in my opinion. For the price there needs to be a better meal put in front of me. If I come back I am trying something else because all the other people at my table had ample portions, so much to the point they could not finish their food.  The coffee, man, what the heck? For a coffee they tout they have gone to great lengths to assure the integrity of it is about as flavorful as a cup of Folgers. One of the biggest disappointments for me in a breakfast spot is the lack of attention to the coffee and how it compliments the food. This coffee is simply not there.  The service was spot on. Great staff that were energetic and accommodating. I am positively impressed with their care and attention to detail. And to tell a table at the height of service on a Sunday to \"take your time, no hurry, do you want more coffee?\" is as about as welcoming as a place can get. Great job, folks.",

I must say the art deco, bright ambiance gives the proper anticipation of a fun meal. I started with an MMMmmm Mimosa which was light and lovely. Carlene, our server, made the entire experience excellent. She even had a whimsical bacon and egg hair clip that she made. Shows you right off the bat, she loves her work. Since it was our first visit she brought us (on her) the pineapple upside down pancake with cinnamon butter. I don't even like sweets, but it was DIVINE! We all scooped it up. Our sweet daughter had the tomato soup and grilled cheese, which she loved. The soup almost tasted like a marinara. Very fresh and delicious. I had the lox, rye, capers, herbed goat cheese, and arugula plate. It was very good. My husband had the corned beef hash. It came out cold and they immediately retired it and made it right. The manager( forgot his name- glasses and a ponytail) did a great job of assuring that it would be perfect the next time.   All in all, we are not going to want to wait until the end of August when Kierland opens so we will be back. BRAVO! Laurie and Rodney Malone",

The wife got Juan's tacos with bacon and they were awesome. The bacon was crispy and meaty. They carry Sriracha and that's the extra kicker I needed. I had the pancake flight, pineapple, strawberry, and blueberry. They were all good but the blueberry was by far the best. The portion size was small for $9. I would have paid whatever for bigger portions. If not for the taco my wife shared with me, I would have left hungry. The reviews are spot on about how loud it is.

We opt out of the wait by getting seated immediately on the patio..  It was covered which was nice, but a misting system would have made it that much more enjoyable!",

It was very good although it could have been served a little warmer. The menu here offers some unique items. It is a little pricey but that doesn't seem to bother the crowd. We are looking forward to Snooze AM opening up in Gilbert. Two things kept it from getting 5 stars from me... the pot pie could have been warmer and prices are a tad high. We were pleased with our serving sizes for both items we ordered.",

The beacon was burnt the egg was under cooked and the pancakes were alittle dry and hard. I hate to say the food didn't even compensate for the service. I was disappointed.

    "text": "I've only heard rave reviews about this place and had been encouraged for weeks to try this with the ever efficient quote of \"YOU Would LOVE This Place\", and part of that is True.  We went on a busy Sunday morning which is always a nice time for brunch and people watching. we also had just done a vigorous hike prior and were starving! We arrived around 10 am and we were Finally seated around 1045. only 20 mins past the given wait time, and without even an \"I'm so sorry the wait will be longer then expected\" or even a general nod in our direction. We were told to download an app and wait for our name to appear, we were never approached about our table being ready.  After being seated our server came by with waters (no straws) She was training a new employee and kindly introduced us to her. She then left the table and didn't return for about 5 mins to take our drink order. 1 beer and the hopes of a taster were ordered. the person who ordered the taster had to wait an extra 7 mins to place her drink order because our server was no where to be found. We were starving and wanting to order, seeing as we had 45 mins before being sat to browse their menu we all already knew what we were after. We finally were able to flag down our server and were able to order.  THE FOOD (actually came out pretty quick) man!!!! I wish I could review the food. I ordered a BREAKFAST BURRITO with the soyrizo (soy Chorizo) instead of eggs. my girlfriends ordered veggie omelets and scrambles, which looked amazing, and pancakes.  I had asked prior if the soyrizo was going to be spicy and was instantly put at ease that it was mild and full of flavor. I had one bite of my burrito and my mouth was on fire. if there was flavor it was masked by the intense amount of spices that were bombarding my taste buds. My girlfriends hash browns was more like wet mush in a ring, and the scramble was almost too much on the wet side for the eggs to have been cooked all the way thru. Too bad our server was also MIA yet again during our ENTIRE MEAL. I would have liked to have tried something I could actually eat considering my stomach was probably growling loud enough for our neighboring table to hear (even over the blaringly loud club dance music they were playing).  THE SERVICE I work in the F&B industry and have been a proud provider of excellent customer service for 15 years ( so I do sorta know what Im talking about, not saying Im the best.... I just understand what makes a complete experience) well we definatly got an experience alright.  Our service LACKED every quality of a good experience.  1)Drink orders were taken 5-12 mins after being seated.  2)we had top flag down our server after being sat for almost 20 mins to have our food order taken 3)NOT ONCE did the server stop by, after getting us the required condiments we had asked for in our food order, to see if our food was even to our liking!!!!! that is ELEMENTRY!!!! my plate was pushed to the side with one bite taken out with a napkin on top of it for close to 38 mins before our server returned. 4) SHE DIDNT EVEN ACKNOLEDGE the uneaten food when she did return 5) When the server was informed that the food was inediable she had the manager take care of it..... funny the manager didn't stop by.  Zero Stars for: Service was POOR and SLOW (the girl she was training was more attentive to the tables) Zero Stars for: The Food well they would probably get more stars if I had even been able to try any of it.   They do get one star however for Decor and Such, this place is super HIP and FUNKY with round booths and an open air concept. This is a place that wants to be seen.  All in All this was a disappointing experience and I wont be returning to give it a second chance. If any friends or relatives ask about this place I will highly discourage them from wasting their time and money.",

This is seriously the best pancake I've ever had. Oozing with cinnamon butter and pineapple sauce and perfectly crisp. And that wasn't even the food we ordered! I had the Winter Harvest Benny Benedict. Nice twist on a regular old Benedict. It's a polenta base with Brussels sprouts. Tasted amaze balls! And the hash browns that came with it were just as good. Start to finish, from the friendly service, fun decor, and the food is seriously on point. Do yourself a favor and forget whatever place you eat brunch at and go here.

Sunday morning/ish, we crawled across town, found parking, and approached the packed eatery. We shared a high top table with six other people in almost a cafeteria feel, appropriate for a college setting, and quickly realized we were the oldest people in the joint.  Who cares. Coffee. Please.   Waitress was adorable, sweet, helpful and fast. Got us that coffee and some water (good for your hangover) and I ordered the Breakfast Burrito (must have in AZ or NM when you're coming there from Boston) and my husband got the corned beef hash.   the burrito was outstanding. Got the green and red chile sauce in Christmas style, and had sausage added. Ten thumbs up. It was as big as my head and I ended up sharing about 1/3 of it with my husband.   The girl sitting catty-corner from me asked what it was and we struck up a conversation about the food and options. I didn't feel old anymore - I felt like just another breakfast woofer amongst a bunch of students, and then realized there were some parents there with their college kids and the place opened up to a bigger family feel in my mind.   I thought about a morning cocktail to keep the roll going, but we had to make tracks. The menu looked fantastic for such treats, and I kind of regret not getting one ...   maybe next time.   Wish there was a Snooze here in Boston. I'd so go.",

I watched a blind man get his sight after one piece of bacon, and the chickens came out to personally introduce each egg. There was something cool about the coffee I don't remember, but it tastes like liquid nirvana. Long story short, don't go here if you hate good food, a friendly staff, or life in general.",

She was so sweet,  fun,  and attentive.  I will be back. I had the pea polenta bene. It was really yummy.  my only complaint would be the kids meal quesadilla was mostly potato inside and then came with a side of potato.  I'll probably just get my kid a regular meal next time.",

These were blueberry pancakes and they were as close to homemade as I've tasted. DElicious Mom and I split an egg/spinach sandwich on ciabatta with holland aide aioli. Kitchen split in two plates for us always a very classy touch. Aioli served in side instead of sandwich ...great move so each ca put as little or much as they want. Ciabatta was fresh and soft, aioli was just the right flavor smack for the sandwich. Only complaint is they should have soy creamer not just soy milk. Our Sunday morning was late March so at that hour it was beautiful and cool.  But all they have is garage doors open and patios with umbrellas. Owners are from Colorado ... Obviously don't have a concept of 120 degree weather.  They should be made to eat an entire lunch meal on patio from April in and rethink their cooling strategy  Sales will certainly tell.  No matter how delicious the food is, it can't be enjoyed under little shade and no cooling",

I went to the Snooze in Tempe this morning for my birthday breakfast and I must say its some of the best service I have experience in a long time! Our server was great (Julia) Food was amazing. Even received a free pancake for my birthday which I didn't expect. Also one of our orders got messed up and the manager (didn't grab his name) but he fixed the problem quick with no problems. I'm happy to say I'll be spreading the word about your restaurant and the GREAT service! Keep up the good work!",

If I knew I was going to be charged for a glass of champagne I would've got it with no oj at all. I would've disputed it but with our service being slow I didn't want to wait around.",

There was clearly an empty table right in front but we were told \"We are holding that table for someone so you have about a 10 - 15 minute wait.\" That was almost enough to make me leave. However, we sat and waited a bit, then the hostess told us they were not going to hold the table any longer so she sat us. Enter our server Lyle. ADORABLE!!! The sweetest kindest server EVER. I'd go back just for him if I didn't live so far. Then the food arrived. My food looked gorgeous, fresh, yummy! But (although I specifically said \"Nothing spicy\") there was spicy Tajin sprinkled all over the top of my eggs. Lyle apologized for the error and brought me replacement eggs. After that it was perfection. I would definitely go back again.",

While picking up our car rental from Turo, the car's owner recommended this place for some coffee and breakfast, and I'm sure glad he did. The service was spectacular, the house blend coffee was fantastic, and the food was delicious. Our server, Angela, was as polite as could be and even brought us out a free sweet potato pancake fresh from the kitchen for us to try. She made us feel very welcome from the get-go. The food was simply incredible. My friend got the Snooze Classic and I got the half-and-half order of Eggs Benedict with the Chili Verde and Steak & Eggs. Everything on my plate was fresh, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The steak was cooked a perfect medium-rare which suit the dish very well, the grilled asparagus and onions were an excellent compliment, and the pico de gallo tasted like it was picked fresh from the garden. The menu has plenty of options for every palette and the cocktail bar will satisfy anyone as well. I would definitely recommend Snooze for breakfast if you're in the Tempe area, I'd eat breakfast here every morning if I could.",

My friend recommended the chilaquiles one, and she had the great insight to substitute the corn tortilla with English muffins. Yes, it makes it less authentic, but corn tortilla just don't soak up that deliciously runny egg as well as English muffins do. It is absolutely heavenly!  My very first time at Snooze as at the Gilbert location, and that day, all of our orders were incredibly salty. I've also had some rather curt servers there. However, the staff (servers and chefs) here at the Tempe location know what they are doing. The food came out better than I expected and the servers were friendly. Although we waited an hour to be seated (this was a Saturday morning at 10 am), it was definitely worth it. Next time I am feeling in the mood for brunch at Snooze, I will pick this location over the Gilbert one.",

I need breakfast this morning there were many business people there with students and a lot of laptops using the robust Wi-Fi. Very clean venue, good value pricing on the menu friendly and fast service b I ordered an egg white omelette with chicken sausage, wheat toast and hashbrowns. My omelette was perfectly prepared I also had jalapenos spinach and tomatoes. I had a very exotic brand of wheat toasted not sure what it was but it was fresh and tasty. Hashbrowns came out it in an usual circular presentation but they were perfect. Restroom small but clean. Many different seating options which I love the venue is very bright. Outdoor patio seating is complete with a ping-pong table and games. Parking is a little tough metered parking outside if you're lucky. Parking lot right next-door at the sign is hidden",

After waiting 45 minutes for a table we were seated and then waited 30 minutes for our breakfast to arrive.  When we received it, all three dishes were lukewarm.  This is a big turn off to us.  My wife had the Pancake flight and she found it just OK, there just wasn't much taste over the sugar.  My son was satisfied with his breakfast.  I asked for an omelet with chorizo, sausage and two orders of cheddar.  What I received was a lukewarm omelet swimming in a sea of grease.  It was awful.   When I received the bill, I understood why.  I did not get what I ordered, I received an omelet with sausage crumble.  And the bill. . for three of us, about $50.",

We recently moved here from Seattle and I loved all of the hype surrounding Snooze so we have given it a try on multiple occasions but am otherwise underwhelmed with their menu and overall experience.   My family has gone to the downtown Tempe location multiple times and have enjoyed it but find the hype a little overrated for what we were met with. Being there at brunch you know it's busy but the waiters have been so maxed and are literally at the table to take your order then you're on your own which is a bummer. Still on the hunt for the place we will become regulars at :)",

FOOD!  Now the food.. my god! The flavors in our meals.. were just the BOMB! I had some benedict.. with a green sauce, pico de gallo and tortillas..can't remember NAMES RIght now.. but let's just say I didn't leave one BIT behind! The mimosas were phenomenal.. not too much OJ and not too much bubbly(even tho I wouldn't have complained for that lol) overall the food was so good, that I can't wait to bring my NY friends here since were such brunchers out there lol",

I was in Tempe for work and had my infant with me; of course she woke up on East Coast time and I knew I would need a hearty breakfast and espresso to start the day. Snooze was a short walk from my hotel and opens at 6:30 am (thank goodness!). My waitress was so sweet, tucked me and the stroller in a corner, and was very attentive throughout my meal. My cappuccino was really good - miles beyond espresso in New England brunch places. The corned beef hash was spicy, filling, and delicious, and the young man who brought it to my table said, \"I hope you enjoy!\" What more could I want out of this experience? I just wish there were a Snooze in Providence!",

My soon to be son-in-law who doesn't know it yet, loved it and the thick slices of bacon earned it 5 out of 5 stars.  ~Pancake flight with pancake of the day (blackberry), blueberry danish, and pineapple upside down. My daughter loved the blackberry the best .. hidden caramelized walnuts in the pancake gave it the oohhh-what's-this surprise. Upside down and blackberry pancakes were excellent as well. 5 out of 5.   ~Benny Dua with chilaquilles and chili verde: very nicely done and well presented. It was an interesting take on eggs Benedict. It wasn't as saucy so the flavor would permeate but it was delicious nevertheless. 4 out of 5 ~OMG! French toast: never came. So we got this taken off our bill. Glad though because we didn't realize that was hellalot of food after we had put in the order.  ~Fall greens- I had to represent the healthy side of the family. Would order this again. Greens were fresh and the sweetness of the beets and the saltiness of the thick chunks of bacon perfectly complimented the naturally  lightly bitterness of the baby kale. 5 out of 5.  Flip was our friendly server. Not going to blame him for the OMG French toasts because we didn't need them anyway.  The restaurant was well lit, open, and clean. It has a welcoming aura to it.

The first was their traditional Benedict with ham, the other was the Chile Verde Benedict!  The hollandaise was a cream cheese base so it was not as eggy as other hollandaise I've had and was tasty though more mild than expected. The chile verde pleasantly surprised me! Had a nice kick to the back end of the bite.  The tortillas in place of the English muffin gave a great textural contrast to the melt in your mouth pork!  I cannot wait to come back to try their many other food items such as their pancake of the day or their breakfast burritos that look like the size of a small child.  Overall a very great experience made better with the expertise and care of Vinny!",

    "text": "Came here with my boyfriend for brunch while we were in town for a music festival during Halloween weekend. The place came highly recommended, and being such a foodie, I had to check it out. We came in a little later (around 1) after their rush and were seated right away at the community table. The staff was all dressed up in costumes being that it was Halloween which was cute (the bartenders were all characters from Orange is the New Black which I thought was pretty awesome.. it is a major college town after all.) After a long night, the first thing we went to was the cocktails. They had multiple Bloody Mary options which is always a great first impression for us! We tried the Gazpacho (lighter and refreshing spin on a bloody with cucumber) it was good, but the best one has to be the Bangkok! It has fish sauce, cilantro, lime, basil, sriracha, and a spicy, salty rim -- AMAZING! Arguably one of the best bloody's I've ever had and that's really saying something. Onto the food... everything sounded amazing, but we both decided on some benny's (there are a ton of them on the menu and they have an option of a \"duo\" benny which is nice because you can do one of each.) I ordered the duo of the \"benny goodman\" and the \"bella! bella!\" because I couldn't decide, but unfortunately when the food came they were both the goodman, but I didn't complain because 1) I work in the industry and know that's annoying (although they did mess up my order.. I hate to waste food and I know if it's sent back it's thrown out) and 2) it was delicious! I would have liked to try the other one, too, but if that's the worst thing that happened at this place I can live with it. The goodman is like a lox bagel style eggs benedict and it was to die for! My boyfriend got the chilaquiles benedict and really enjoyed that, too, (but he said mine was better). Service was good, but not memorable. Maybe it is different if you are at a table instead of the community, but either way it didn't take away or add anything to the experience. The menu was so great that I want to come back and try everything on it! The best news was when I realized they have a location where I live! New regular brunch spot for sure!  Definitely check it out! And you have to try the Bangkok Bloody Mary and the Benny Goodman. So so good!",

We heard good things and wanted to try it out. I am not a university kid, I am a community college, rock n roll kid and I couldn't help but to scoff at some of the belligerent college bros stumbling out of some of the locations near by. No big deal, they need to have fun too I suppose! The wait was about 40 minutes, but the weather was nice and they gave us coffee. Some of the staff were nice, some seemed blah, but Kate (gosh I hope that is her name!) behind the bar was serving us and she was an A fucking + server. Best server I have had in probably years. Her suggestions were amazing, her knowledge about the food and drinks was ample and her smile was so contagious. Great service, nice mid century feel, and good food! The food was great, but not amazing (I know it is hard to do that with breakfast food) so Snooze gets 4 stars from me. If I could do 4.5, I would... Just cause the service was so good.",

I flipped It over to see if it was undercooked or something and It revealed big slash marks in the pancake which put me off the rest of my breakfast. I couldn't wave anyone down because my waiter forgot I was there so by the time I was remembered, it was too late. The waiter explained that the cuts were to make sure it was done?!?! Uh if you have to destroy one side of a thin pancake to determine the doneness, you shouldn't be making them. I made perfect pancakes when I was 10 years old and never had to do that nor any other place I have ever had pancakes had the underside look like that.  On the positive, they did apologize and remove the charge from my bill. I just will refrain from the pancakes at this location going forward and continue to flip them over in the future.",

The vibe is .. positive..you can feel nothing but good vibes from everyone in this establishment, the staff and people who are eating and waiting for a table. Everyone is just so flipping relaxed! A great relief from the every day stress! The food.. interesting choices and yummy foods that I've never seen before.. so I decided to try pineapple pancakes.. the dude next to me had a breakfast burrito that was the biggest burrito I've ever seen.. and let me tell you.. I've lived here for a very very very long time and seen my share of breakfast burritos! If we had time to spare we would have waited to see if that guy ate the whole thing, because he said he could., but in good consideration I just couldn't find it in my reasoning to stay and watch.. knowingly that there are other people who are still waiting for a table! This is also a great place for outdoor seating if you have your fur baby! There were plenty of well behaved dogs on the patio! Mine was at doggie daycare having a blast instead:) because I was going to be shopping afterwards! I highly recommend this restaurant! This is definitely the coolest breakfast spot I've ever been in Arizona!",

    "text": "Yeah just like most Snooze locations, it's really hard to go wrong when dining at one. If you're a fan of brunch and breakfast, then this place is for you.  Pancakes? They got 'em. French Toast? They got that. Other breakfast and brunch stuff...yeah, whatever, they go that too. There's just too much good stuff on the menu.  Just like any other Snooze location, their decor is sleek, colorful and modern...and classy. Well, at least that's how I feel each time I dine. On top of that, I've never had bad service at a Snooze location and this visit was no different. That's pretty good considering that I think the entire staff is probably attending ASU which is literally across the street. Like seriously, across the street. Anyway, the server was very friendly.  \"So what did you have, Jeff? I really want to know. That's why I'm reading this review.\"...said no one ever. However, if you must ask, I had the Drunken Monkey French Toast. Why? Because I love French Toast, and the name was intriguing...and the description sounded good.  Funny story, it was good. The End.  Okay not really the end.  Although the portion size was a little smaller than your typical Jeff S. standards would consider worthy, the fact that it was a nicely arranged dish of carbs in the form of sugar, bread,fruit...and sugar, it was good enough for me to overlook the less than Herculean serving size (i.e., mere mortal serving size). Yeah, the rest of you normal eaters will probably be fine. I'll be sure to include the obligatory picture.  So would I eat here again? I'm pretty sure the answer to that should be pretty obvious, but in case you are fairly dense, the answer is \"yes\". Why? Because I love the food, the atmosphere and well, breakfast food in general. The only downside is that currently I don't find myself in this part of town that often, but no need to worry, I'm sure at some point in time I'll make my way back and this place will be at the top of my breakfast list.",

The server was great and friendly, we got our coffee while we looked at the menu and found what we wanted. My girlfriend and I both got eggs Benedict with hash browns and it was really delicious, we had been craving eggs Benedict and the way they are done at Snooze is just great. I can't wait to go back!

Surprisingly, I got a table within ten minutes of checking in with my husband. Yay! Once we arrived at our table our waitress came to take our drink and breakfast order. Minutes later...our food was already delivered at our table. Talk about FAST! Our food came out so delicious. So delicious that I don't want to order anything else on the menu because I already fell in love with the first item I tried. I recommend coming early because they don't take reservations in advance, they're kind of a first come first serve type of restaurant. They're dog friendly. So, come and bring your pooches! If you're unable to find parking, the best option is to park at the nearby parking garage. Not many restaurants offer military discounts, but this Snooze location does!",

I had the Breakfast pot pie, with a side of hashbrowns. Everything on the plate was delicious, it is a dish I have not seen anywhere else.

She was pleasant, fun, and on top of refills!  As for the food, this is one of the few places I've been to that cooked perfect over-easy eggs. No burnt edges, and an oozing yolk that was perfect for mixing in the fantastically seasoned hash-browns, or to dip the toast in.  The only thing that kept this from being a 5 star was the chicken sausage. It just didn't have that breakfast sausage flavor. While it may seem silly to say that chicken should taste more \"sausage\" and less like chicken; for chicken breakfast sausage, this should be the case. Whatever seasoning they use really brings out the flavor of the chicken and doesn't make it taste like a breakfast sausage alternative. Maybe more thyme and sage was In order?  Despite the chicken sausage, I would definitely come back. One gripe is overshadowed by the fantastic service and mouth-watering hash-browns. Plus, they can cook eggs like champs!",

The food however fell flat for me. After waiting quite a while (which I was willing to overlook since it was so busy) when our food came, it was flavorless. I ordered the breakfast taco and the eggs Benedict, and my son ordered chocolate chip pancakes. My breakfast taco was just okay, but the Benedict not only had an eggshell in it but the flavor combination was off. My son's pancakes were burnt and also didn't have any flavor. I was really looking forward to eating here after seeing the wonderful reviews. Maybe I'll go back to give it another shot?",

It's seared steak medallions atop roasted poblano cheddar grit cakes with asparagus, roasted mushrooms and tomatoe topped with poached Cage free eggs with a smoked cheddar hollandaise and gemolata..... words can't describe the amount of perfection with the balance of flavors and the steak is insanely flavorful and delicious! Now onto the pancakes!!! BEST PANCAKES IVE EVER HAD! Ask about the pancake of the day it's different everyday! Today it was vanilla batter with white chocolate chips, ganache, spiced ginger chips, granola, and sprinkled in powder sugar my waitress Kate was soooooooo sweet and adorable and she just made what was already and Amazing experience into a perfect one!

The bartender was quick to wipe down the bar area in front of us and provide us with menus and placesettings!  Then we got down to business and ordered up the Steak and Eggs Benny and a trip of pancakes that included pineapple upside down cake, cannoli cream, and the pancake of the day - a blueberry mocha concoction!  The Steak and Eggs Benny was THE BEST benny I've ever had!  Just WOW!  I could eat that every single day!  Benny perfection!  And the pancakes were all deliciously as well... but that Blueberry Mocha POTD was a heavenly flapjack that was light, fluffy, not too sweet and an incredible example of pancakery-ness at its finest!

How can anyone complain about wait times when they give u FREE fresh brewed coffee while u wait?!?!

The combination of eggs on steak was just bursting with so much flavor that there was never a boring bite!   The pancake flight was the perfect ending to our breakfast of perfection. The pineapple turnover was my least favorite of the three. The sweet cannoli & the pancake of the day (blueberry mocha with a splash of nirvana) were definitely my favs!! I suggest you don't inhale them all in one sitting as eating half will satisfy even the most sweetest of tooth cravings.  Get yourself to one of their locations quick!! Don't snooze on Snooze!!!",

I got the breakfast burrito (which was huge) and got a single chocolate raspberry pancake (which was their Valentine's Day special) on the side. My husband ordered French toast with bacon, and he was happy. We both got coffee, and it was good as well. I LOVED the aspect that they had a full cocktail list, even though we didn't choose to drink this time.",

Maybe not close to the location depending on the time of day. The food was okay but the service was on the slow side. I came on a Saturday morning at 7:30 AM with two little kids in tow; the kids pancakes took about 20 minutes to come out as did my omelette despite being one of only six tables there at that time in the morning. By the time the food did come out, it was a tad on the cooler side. However dining with 2 kids under the age of 7, we just ate it as the kids were getting restless. It looked like they were training a few new people so I don't know if that was the cause for delay? Overall the food was okay but not as good as it has been at other snooze locations.  We would come back but we would probably go to the other location in Kierland. They have adequate seating indoor and outdoors. They have a full bar as well for those wanting a drink.",

I appreciated that ! She didn't act like it was an inconvenience to her or would slow her down she genuinely seemed like she cared !

Well if that wasn't enough the food makes it really easy to love as well.   I always get either the breakfast burrito or huevos rancheros which are both delicious. I feel like you can really taste the freshness in the meal and is plated so pretty as well (perfect for the gram.) The pancakes are also a crowd favorite as well, I just tend to go more towards a hearty breakfast than a sweet one :)   The ambiance of snooze is also fantastic. You can always tell you are at snooze with the classic colors and fun decor! Service also tends to be great as well and everyone I have ever had is super nice and personable. Overall 5/5 stars and will of course be going back soon!",

    "text": "Finally made it to Snooze!  Even if it is in a different state.  Husband and I flew into Sky Harbor and it was along our route to visit some friends.  It was easy to find parking at a meter right across the street and we didn't even have to feed quarters into the meter since it was before the time they started charging.  The wait was about 30 minutes on a Saturday morning and they got us in and out in a little over an hour, including the wait.  We were not only impressed by the service, but the food was worth waiting for.    I opted for the flight of pancakes - an indecisive person's dream - with a pumpkin pancake, blueberry lemon, and pineapple upside down.  All were good, but the pineapple may have been one of the best pancakes I have ever had.  Husband had the Snooze Spuds Deluxe, which was basically like a skillet with potatoes, two sides (i.e. bacon, sausage, ham),  cheese and eggs.  It was a solid choice as well.    I can't wait to try Snooze in CA!  Since all of their locations utilize local goods, I'm hoping each is a little bit different.",

    "text": "I am normally in charge of finding restaurants, but my wife discovered Snooze on Yelp and just had to give it a try.    We arrived last Friday around noon to a very, very busy dining area.  The hostess took our cell number and advised they will text when our table was ready.  Was supposed to be a 25 minute wait, but they texted within ten minutes.  Our order was taken quickly: a pancake flight, chicken sausage, and a chai tea for my wife.  French toast, chicken sausage, and hash browns for me.  A \"Sandwich I Am\" (soft pretzel roll filled with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and a sausage patty, served with a side of smoked cheddar hollandaise), and a hash brown for my son.  My wife's pancake flight (chocolate peanut butter, pineapple upside down, and the flavor of the day) was fantastic.  She wasn't a huge fan of the chicken sausage, but loved her chai.  My son loved his \"Sandwich I Am\" and thought the hash brown puck - see photos - was just okay.  My French toast was perfect, I liked the chicken sausage, and the hash brown puck was not the best, but I still managed to finish it.  The hash browns just need a little something else to make it great... so close.  A little cheese, and some onion powder perhaps.  Our waitress, Abbie, was fantastic.  The atmosphere was great.  Volume/noise was acceptable.  The interior decor was gorgeous - very bright with lots of vibrant colors.  Location was great as it was next to \"A Mountain\".  Very good experience - would return when in the area again.",

It's a great place to meet up with friends in the morning, whether it be to catch up after a long night of partying, or for a post hike meal. Just know that if you plan on stopping by during the weekend after a morning work out, make sure you get there early enough to avoid the crowd so that you can get your protein in asap. If you come later in the morning, you will be sure to find yourself a line.  What's cool is that they take your cell number and text you when your table is ready, so you don't have to worry about staying too close. They have a coffee bar in the front for those waiting, as well as corn hole in the patio to keep people entertained.  They have a nice selection of foods on their menu. So far my favorite has been their OMG French Toast.",

We recently visited another Snooze location in Del Mar, CA and were so disappointed that it wasn't anything like the Tempe location. College towns tend to have more lively staffs.  It was so evident in comparison where we could barely get our servers attention in CA.  This place has such fun, energetic, playful, happy servers that make your visit even more enjoyable.  They are attentive, team players and were knowledgeable of their menus and did a great job each day steering us into trying new things.  Definitely worth the wait. I loved the grilled grapefruit, the pancake flights, OMG their menu is so much fun for breakfast.  Not the same old same old breakfast fare. Pet friendly is always a bonus in our book.",

We waited a good 10-15 min before we had to ask a waiter to get some service.  We saw at least 2 other tables that came after us that were served before us.  Anyway, the waiter apologized and offered to give each of us a free pancake.  Overall, the service was good once you can get their attention.  Keep in mind, the place is only 1/2 full, and there were plenty of servers walking around, so I'm not sure what the excuse would be.    Food wise, my friend got the omelet and I got the hash beef.  As these are simple breakfast items, it's really hard to mess them up.  I think it's because we were short on time, the speed of the service was certainly lacking.  By the time we got our bill, we had to wait another 5 min before our bill was pick up by our waiter.  Granted, we probably should have told him in advance that we were limited on time, but the fact the place is not that busy, we didn't think it would matter.   Bottom line is that the service was good indeed, just the speed of the service could have been better.  As for the taste of food, it's just the basic taste of breakfast, nothing unique to say this is the place I have to come back next time.",

It was packed, many standing around the hostess stand waiting for their text that their table is ready. Love the text idea and great they don't spam you with ads and such afterwards. We waited quite a bit to sit, longer than they quoted, but they are super friendly and have water and coffee out and offered to you as you wait, worth it!  The atmosphere and decorating are great, super modern, progressive and clean, bright and fun. The service was extremely friendly, from the host/hostess, wait staff and bussers.  The menu is enormous and everything sounds amazing. Ingredients are fresh, local, highest quality and dishes are creative, full of unique flavor and extremely well presented. Everything we had was absolutely delicious. We ordered way too much food because everything sounded phenomenal, and it was! Prices are a little high, but well worth it, really.  It's not close for me to go, but absolutely worth it. The pairing of excellent service, stellar, fresh, balanced, tasty, unique food, good value, and a really fun, bright, clean, active atmosphere make this a fantastic breakfast choice on any given day. Go, enjoy, you'll be glad you did!",

Overall the breakfast was pretty heavy on the sugar but we are on vacation so it was a good indulgence   Service was great, we sat outside on the patio & it was a beautiful morning.  I would recommend the cake of the day!",

There was a long wait time to be seated which speaks to the restaurant's popularity but the reason for the 3 stars is the less than great service once inside. Service was slow and seemed unorganized, the waitress was inattentive, and the food took 30 minutes to come out. If you have the time to spare, this is not a bad spot to check out.",

You snooze, you lose! LOL. The place had a considerable line by the time we left around 10:30 am. The menu is solid; pancakes, eggs benedict, and breakfast sandwiches that will blow your mind.

We came in late this morning (ok fine it was closer to noon) for some brunch. The place was hoppin' and we were told there was a 30-45 minute wait. We grabbed some coffee at the complimentary station (a plus!) and took a seat to wait. After about 15 minutes the hostess offered up 2 spots at the \"communal\" table to anyone who wanted to take it, so we snatched it up!  It took quite awhile to get a waitress over for our drink orders, and this lady was NOT happy. Couldn't crack a smile to even fake it. So that was a bummer. After about 20 minutes, the food came out. The food was pretty good, I'm missing where all of the rave food reviews are coming from, but I don't doubt that other items on the menu are fabulous. I got the eggs benedict (one traditional style and the other \"Bunny! Bunny! Benni\" I believe it was called, which had shaved prosciutto, arugula, balsamic...I was not blown away by any of it. The hash brown cake that came with it was kind of bland and a bit under-cooked. My fiance (!) had the breakfast burrito. It was gigantic and he devoured every bite and loved it. Will try again, order something else, and hope for a server who can muster up a smile :)",

We wanted pancakes but then something on the menu called our attention: the O.M.G. French toasts. We decided to give it a try, admittedly a bit skeptical. We were blown away and we were constantly mumbling \"Oh My God! this is amazing\"! We had to come again the next day before leaving Phoenix back home. This time I wanted the full order for myself so I didn't  have to share it!   I would give it 5 stars because of the OMG French toasts, the Benedicts were great and tasty. The MMM mimosa was great too. The service is great and friendly. However, my only complaint was that I ordered an OJ and asked the waiter whether it was freshly squeezed OJ, he said that it was, but when I tried it, it tasted like tropicana orange juice, which is good but not what I wanted or had in mind. Other than that it is the perfect place for your breakfast and brunch cravings.",

Under the table is a crayon and crushed Pringles from who knows when. On top of that they put us at a table underneath a planter swarming with flies and bees, needless to say I have done the landscaping for them. Will update this post after The meal if the food happens to be better than the service, which is what we have heard. Way to treat a new patron, will not recommend or be back.",

They had a whole page of their menu dedicated to their crazy pancake concoctions and the best thing is that you can substitute the bread side for a pancake on any breakfast entree. I definitely recommend splitting a pancake if you can't eat a lot of pancakes; they are huge. The bacon was thick and crispy, but the hash browns could've been cooked a little longer. Our server, Shannon, was awesome.",

The poached eggs were overcooked. The hollandaise sauce wasn't enough to even cover one of the sides of the dish, and it was nearly flavorless. The hash browns were bland and undercooked, and definitely came from the freezer. What a disappointment. I can only suppose that this restaurant has so many good reviews because the majority of people there were college students who may not quite yet know what good food is supposed to taste like! Two stars instead of one because the waitress was awesome.",

First off- we ordered mimosas that had barely any champagne in it- so we paid $8 for orange juice. Second, I got the steak and egg Benny. The entire dish was grossly unsalted making the entire dish bland. And the plate it was on was tiny so I couldn't even cut my food properly without food falling off my plate. Plate choice and salting are basic basic things you shouldn't be screwing up. My fiance got the spuds tower thing and all his hash browns were practically raw with no crisp on them. Hash browns are supposed to be crispy. And he got two add ons which they did not give him. Unimpressed to say the least.",

There are so many great options I recommend the BEAT sandwich, Eggs Benedict, and pancakes with a side of bacon/sausage and I always leave here pretty content. While getting noticed/seated can be a bit of a hassle at times, service is otherwise spot-on. Sometimes the servers are really nice and give you some random pancakes on the house, too. My star off is due to to-go service and the drinks. It's honestly annoying that they don't have plastic utensils here for to-go orders. Of all things to not have! Sometimes servers say they'll bring utensils but never do, which has led me to be 99.9% sure they don't have them. Also, the drinks here, non-alcoholic and alcoholic, are not amazing, not to mention pricey. I suggest just getting water and spending your drink money on some sides (i.e. breakfast meats, fresh fruit, etc.) instead.",

You're able to order two Benedict's which was perfect for me. The steak and eggs benny is by far the best thing I ate. Perfect seasoning, texture and the steak was cooked perfect!

They have yard games to play while waiting for a table or if you'd like to hangout and drink mimosas all morning.   Plan ahead if you are coming on a weekend. They don't take reservations as is the standard in Tempe; and the wait can get up over 2 hours! Have patience because the food will be worth the wait!",

There's always a line but it goes by fairly quickly especially if you have a group of 4 or less. I like how the menu is slightly different at each location so it's definitely worth checking out different locations. I generally stuck with the egg benedicts. They're super delicious. Although, I wish their portions were a little bit bigger or decrease the prices since each plate rarely ever fills me up compared to other brunch places I've been. Nonetheless, I definitely recommend Snooze if you haven't tried it yet.",

Well, you *can* still get two plates but then you're just being a pig.  Since I was so indecisive today, I got a \"Benny Duo\" where you can have one Benedict of one type and one of another. The first was with smoked salmon on a slice of pumpernickel. Tasty and excellent. The egg was perfect. The second was with green chile and a potato base of some sort. Also excellent. The chile had a little bit of a zing to it and it improved with a bit of Cholula.  Service was excellent, sitting at the breakfast counter. Coffee was refilled and it was good coffee.",

Bacon was odd tasting and pancake lacked flavor.  Conscious of the group was mediocre food.  It's tempe there are TONS Of other restaurants I'd recommend over this one.",

    "text": "A group of 4 of us went here for brunch on a Saturday. It was BUSY. The hostess estimated a 20-30 min wait. We were hungry so we were hoping it would be closer to 20 min. The waiting area inside is small and there were a lot of people waiting. Outside, there's a bench but that's pretty much it. It ended up taking closer to 45 min for us to be seated, unfortunately. While we were waiting though, we looked over the menu so we would be ready to order asap.  I got the Snooze Spuds Deluxe because I love potatoes. The 2 Flavor Saveurs (included in the price) I chose were bacon and caramelized onions. I didn't feel like the onions added much and I normally love caramelized onions. Next time, I would just get 2 meats...probably bacon and chicken sausage. The 4 of us all got different dishes (can't remember what everyone got) and we all really liked it!  When it came time for the bill, our server brought out a device that would let us split the bill and pay it ourselves. You just select which items you want to pay for and swipe/insert your card, and pass it along to the next person. Super simple and really useful and practical for groups. It seemed like this was something new they were trying out because our server asked for our feedback with using it.  We all enjoyed Snooze and I would come back, but probably only during a less busy/popular time just so I wouldn't have to wait as long.",

The portions weren't very big, but I probably won't get this again because it's pretty cut and dry.   I'll probably swing by again and I'll try out the pancakes / french toast. Very accessible from ASU, and some nice places to venture around for a post-meal walk.

    "text": "A gladdening proclamation for this Saturday morning: I am a fan of Snooze.   What has changed? Change comes only from within, so I've been told. Thus, I have implemented the following which have rendered Snooze more favorable in my sight.   (1) My last three visits have all been early-- 6:45 AM, 7:45 AM, and 8:30 AM respectively. In all cases, seating has been quick, service has been good, and food has been excellent.   Previously, I attempted to come for breakfast at 9:00 AM or later, and to me, that is just not worth it. The wait can reach an hour or longer, the service is inevitably slower, and the food -- again, by my observations -- does not compare to the early-morning harvest.   (2) I've changed up the orders! In my last three visits, I have ordered the sweet potato hash, Goldilocks' porridge, and, this morning, more sweet potato hash. These \"Light as a Feather\" dishes, though lower in calories, are certainly not lower in quality, flavor, or even presentation. They are creative, delicious meals that treat the appetite without a sliver of guilt or jab to the wallet.   Previously, my orders were sauce-heavy: oh Benny, how I wanted to like you. My girlfriend's order of the pot pie was gravy with a side of pot pie -- just didn't do it for us. Maybe these styles are appealing for others, but going forward, we'll stick to what we know.   ~  I am always pleased to have my mind changed, and I say that Snooze has captured my approval and gratitude. Look at their accolades; clearly they have been making the right moves. From myself and all in my company, we recommend Snooze highly, and as previously insisted -- just get there early.",

I had a moment of hesitation when I was ordering--cheddar hollandaise did not sound good. Should have listened to my gut. It wasn't for me. But that's Snooze. They combine big flavors. Sometimes it works, sometimes it's a hard no. I'm kind of a traditionalist.    Everything else was great, as always.

If I had to give 1 piece of constructive criticism it would be the hash browns were very heavy-handed on black pepper.  This was a consistent comment from most of the people in our party.

    "text": "I wish I lived in Phoenix so that I could eat at Snooze EVERY. SINGLE. WEEKEND.  We arrived with a group of 6 around 10 AM, which is ill-advised --- they don't take reservations, and by then, the wait was around an hour for a group of our size. I appreciate that they'll text you when your table is ready, so you're able to walk around while you wait. We picked up coffee at another local shop and wandered a bit until we received a text about 10-15 min earlier than we had been promised.   The atmosphere feels a bit 50's diner, and we were seated in an oversized booth. Our waitress was friendly and super helpful, and our food came out pretty quickly. We also enjoyed the background music choice, and I definitely may have exchanged some glances with waitstaff who were dancing to the same songs I was.  There were a variety of fresh, breakfast-y spins on classic cocktails. I enjoyed their mojito, which adds green tea to the mix. If I ever go back, I want to try their Bacon and Eggs cocktail with bacon-infused bourbon.  The food menu offers a wide variety of unique dishes, and we all struggled to decide what we wanted. I appreciated the many options to customize your dish --- you could choose two different Eggs Benedict options to mix and match or swap out your hashbrowns for a pancake of your choosing if you (like me) struggle to decide between sweet and savory brunch. I chose to get one Avocado and one Lox-and-Latke benedict (smoked salmon with a latke instead of an English muffin) and loved every bite. I did like the Avocado benny slightly better. Others at the table ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie, which was essentially eggs and breakfast sausage gravy over puff pastry and seemed to be enjoyed. We also tried the coco-nana pancakes (coconut, banana, chocolate, white choc chips) and the pineapple upside-down pancakes, which were phenomenal. I loved every bite of every dish.   I hope I have an excuse to venture back to Phoenix and eat here again.",

I sipped on a spicy Bloody Mary while watching Sponge Bob on TV as I looked over the menu. The pancakes sounded so good but I was in an egg mood so I decided on the Corned Beef Hash. The girl sitting next to me got an order of Cannoli pancakes and I regretted my decision, I couldn't stop looking at them. I got my dish and regretted it even more. I was very disappointed at the amount of hash I was given, usually you get a portion large enough to hold you up for a good portion of the day which is what I needed heading to an all day music fest. I wound up ordering 1 Sweet Potato pancake and that was very delicious. $25 for this meal was way too much.",

It's tender belly from Denver area and I swear it's the best in the world. To me. I left this place both days so unbelievably full and happy. We did have a considerable wait both days tho- but they have a concierge outside that will make drinks while you wait- yay for Lyle! Also special shout out to Savannah our server on Sunday.

There is a parking garage right next door so that's fab. Second- the service was spot on. The girls look to be college students who are as sweet as attentive. Third- the coffee. I ordered an Americano and it was perfection. Came in a sweet, yellow cup, which any coffee lover can appreciate an original, good mug. Fourth- the food. Oh the food!! Large portions and this was by far the best breakfast burrito I have had. Eggs, hash browns, veggies, and green salsa all rolled into a perfect burrito. Love this place.

We even had to run out to the curb to put more money in the meter because it took forever to get our meals. Additionally, it took almost 15 minutes for one of my friends to receive his juice because the waitress forgot it and never came back to check.  My chai latte was very watery and tasted bland. I won't be ordering that ever again.  Finally, I ordered a \"lighter\" option omelette, but it came soaked in greasy oil which was pooled at the bottom of the plate. All in all this was a pretty bad experience and I will be very reluctant to come back.",

I will say this, sometimes I get a four star experience (food is good and service is helpful and prompt) while during other visits the experience is one star or less (food is good but service is horrible [non existent] and very slow).  When I visit during the week, the service is great. The servers are helpful and I always have water in my glass (a marker of good service). The food is also usually very prompt. During the weekends, the servers are friendly (when they are there) but they don't come back and sometimes mix up your order.  All in all, the food is always reliably good and often very rich. However, the service can be good or bad depending on the day of the week. I suggest going during the week when there are less people while during the weekend there are long waits and spotty service.  For lack of constituency of experience, I give two stars.  Things I've had: 3 Eggs Any Style (Made my order perfect) Breakfast Pot Pie (very very very rich, lots of cream) Snooze Breakfast Burrito (my favorite, large burrito and the flavor is very universally appealing) Green Eggs 'n Hamwich (Delicious) Sister Fig's French Toast (too sweet) Fall Greens (lovely light meal) House Coffee (not strong coffee) Choice Mimosa(for me YES!)",

Ordered the trio pancake off the menu and everything was Delicious, even though everything sounded extremely sweet, it didn't turn out to be like that at all. The pancakes and toppings was lightly coated and everything tasted balanced.   I also order the Huevos Rancheros. I wasn't impressed. It was 2 pieces of corn tortilla, Rachero sauce on top with some sliced sausage and egg whites. I'd stick with the signature pancakes because they are awesome. I also didn't like how ice coffee wasn't free refills because it's \"cold brew\" but yet hot coffee is free refills. The ice was filled to the brim probably only giving me about 6oz of actual cold brew coffee. It was a rip off. They should charge a little extra for unlimited refills. It's not juice, it's ground coffee for crying out loud.",

The building is just beautiful- a ton of thought and money went into making such a comfortable, bright, and airy restaurant. We all know mornings can be rough- so why not have breakfast at an amazing place?  Snooze Tempe is home to some of the best restaurants professionals I've ever encountered. In the last two visits- Flip & Starchild were amazing servers. Friendly and helpful- and just totally on point. Today I was having s friendly debate with my sister and her friend. They had never had the pineapple upside down pineapple pancake- so I was trying to tell them how epic it was. Starchild helped us settle this debate by bringing out a pineapple pancake which was just delicious.   In closing- this place is wonderful. There WILL be a line on the weekends. Just know that in advance. Craig breakfast spots don't have a line- do if you can't wait for amazing food and greet service- just hit up the nearest Denny's and let your taste buds become depressed. Otherwise check out Tempe Snooze and start your day out in the best possible way.",

    "text": "I'm not totally getting the hype here. However, it is tasty enough and worth a visit.   The food: Everyone in my party ordered different types of eggs Benedict. I think between the three of us we tried every single flavor. They were all delicious! The salmon one... was a little weird and I would not recommend it. I felt the menu was a little misleading in that the salmon wasn't pieces but more of a salmon patty.  The hashbrowns were extremely salty but I'll write more about that below.   The drinks: YUM (and affordable!). I ordered a straight up bloody mary with an added strip of bacon for an extra $1.25. I wouldn't recommend adding that extra slice of bacon but the drink was overall tasty.   The service: The service was what made me bump this review from 3 to 4 stars. We were told the wait would be 15 mins but we were seated in less than 5. Our server (I can't remember his name..) was attentive and friendly. My server even put all of my sauces on the side because I said I had a slight dairy allergy. I complained about my hashbrowns being salty and he promptly got me a new batch of them. Deeply appreciated and no hassle! He also offered us water since it was a hot AZ summer day. Overall, the best service I've had in a long time.  Stop by and try some of the dishes! But beware... there's not much here that's dairy-free. You might have to do some improvising.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to come here FOREVER but it is so hard to get in this place on a Saturday or Sunday morning! We finally had the perfect opportunity this past weekend as we were up early running errands around town.   Our first impressions:  Front hostess was super peppy and warm, not just to us, but to everyone..even as the line grew out the door. Her enthusiasm was contagious!   Casual and laid back retro atmosphere. The Tempe location draws a somewhat versatile crowd but it's truly the perfect spot for families and hung-over twenty-somethings alike.   Our server, Savannah, did a fantastic job. She noted that it was our first time, and treated us to a pineapple upside down pancake which literally left me speechless it tasted so good! I am definitely ordering pancakes next time!  My eggs and chicken sausage plate tasted great - I ordered more on the boring side unfortunately. Mimosa came out pretty quickly and was a solid size for the $6.  Overall, this is a no-brainer 5 star rating for amazing food and even amazing-er (yeah, I just made up a word) service!",

Fortunately they text you when you're up, so you aren't tied down. Now let me tell you, deciding what to order at Snooze was probably the hardest decision I've made in 2016. But it was my first day in Arizona, so Juan's Breakfast Tacos it was. My cohorts indulged in the Benny Duo option, which I envied. Fortunately almost everything comes with hollandaise, so I was consoled. Long story short, this is a world class breakfast-ery. Go.",

It's relaxing with a pingpong table and other games for customers to play and chill out. The service was good and quick.  The food is ok. I had the benedicts half ham and half chilaquiles. The ham was good but the chilaquiles was a little plain. My friend got pot pie and I think it has a better taste than the bendicts. In general the place is ok for casual breakfast with typical dishes.  Other thoughts: they have a list of very interesting drinks/cocktails. I didn't try any of them since I was on a rush to see other places in the city, but I would definitely try some of them next time when I have more time",

    "text": "Feels like a ski lodge, they bump an interesting blend of electro/dance music like the lodges too. It makes sense since Snooze is a mostly Colorado based breakfast/brunch chain and the interior matches it's laid back attitude with simple orange decked decor.   Free coffee in the lobby is pretty good but the paid stuff is even better. I can't quite explain the coffee taste but it's a strong bold blend with a fruity and floral aftertaste.  The mocha is delicious! I sipped through it pretty fast but at least there's a lot of whipped cream to eat when your done.   Food-wise they do a great job as well with pretty huge portions. The spuds deluxe was a giant serving of potatoes with scallions and cheese. I chose the barbacoa and mushrooms which were great but wish the dish came with eggs instead of having to add them on for $2 extra dollars. The B.E.A.T. was a solid rendition of a BLT as well with egg and avocado ($1.75 extra) and a nice little cake of hash browns on the side.  Great addition to the neighborhood with Postino's and I look forward to eating here more. The price at both joints though will be limiting my trips sadly :'(  Drinks looked interesting, especially the Bloody Mary variations! Though I'm a little hesitant to get my drank on in the morning.",

When the bill came they charged me an extra $3 for gravy, and an extra $10 for the steak... when I asked they took it down to $5 the \"fancy meats\" were a $3 add on but steak wasn't and option. If I would have known that steak and gravy would cost an extra $8 to a $9 burrito I wouldn't have gotten it. The service was okay but they should tell people how much the add on would be.",

Recommendations were spot on and we ended up ordering some really amazing breakfast plates.    Although the breakfast pot pie and the breakfast burrito are their most popular, my favorite was the Juevos Ranceros with pulled pork on corn tortillas and the Traditional and Winter Harvest Eggs Benedict.     If you love pancakes then you have to try the upside down pineapple pancake.  It lives up to its name and taste like heaven!  You definitely have to try breakfast here at Snooze!",

Snooze is a hot spot for breakfast and will get very crowded on the weekends especially since it is located on ASU campus. You will see your fair share of sorority girls and frat bros but don't let that deter you from enjoying the creative breakfast selections. I went for the vegetarian friendly Eggs Benedict and was very pleased. They serve their hash browns made into a small cone with good flavor but I do prefer mine slightly crispier. The eggs are cooked to perfection and are served on top of a wide range of fun selections. They also have some tasty sounding sandwiches and plates that I have yet to try.   The service is decent but you can tell they are trying to move you through as quickly as possible. They clear your table before you're really done eating and bring the check when you're only half way through your meal. This doesn't bother me too much since I'd rather not wait forever to get my check, but I don't like feeling rushed either. Despite the long waits and mediocre service Snooze is totally worth it because they are friendly and most important the food is fabulous!",

Ordered pancakes and eggs benny, a mimosa and bailey and coffee in one go. Drinks took at least ten minutes, but were great. Now we play the waiting game...45 minutes later we get some food. Which I might add was awesome.  As a restaurant worker, I understand you can't do anything about slow food or bartenders slowly making drinks. But the people next to us got a pancake while they were waiting, the entire table next to us got free shirts, and the other table got a free round of drinks. We got a long wait, good food, and server needing a tad more empathy.   We'll come back. Hopefully they'll get food and drinks times down. A bummer birthday breakfast for two.",

We ate on the patio, which was perfect as it was a beautiful day.  Our server was peppy and attentive.  They were doing a 50s beach/surfer theme, so staff was all dressed in character.    I ordered the Snooze breakfast burrito and a mimosa.  It was very flavorful and I liked that it was black beans instead of refried.  My husband got the corned beef hash breakfast and was equally impressed.  It was very hard to choose what I wanted to eat because there are so many options.  They have a breakfast pot pie that looks sinful.  There are all kinds of breakfast sammies and they have pancake platters if you want to try different flavors.  I would love to eat here again on our next Tempe trip.",

Snooze also has great drink selections with a well crafted breakfast oriented cocktail menu.   Also their pancakes are great, get the pancake flight and try the hot cocoa pancakes!   Go early, as lines start to build on weekends.",

    "text": "I think this a great place to grab breakfast with friends because there are a lot of different things to try on the menu. My first time here a couple years ago was a bad experience, but the couple times after since I've gone they've been really good.   At first I was going to get an egg dish and get a pancake on the side but the pancake was FOUR DOLLARS. FOUR DOLLARS FOR ONE PANCAKE. AND NOT EVEN A BIG PANCAKE, JUST A NORMAL SIZED PANCAKE. lol, ya'll are funny.  So instead, I got the pancake flight this time around and it was such a good decision. Three pancakes, three different flavors, so yum. I was only not feeling the pumpkin pancake, so I wish I would have gotten a different kind. BUT they had their pancake of the day which had chocolate and pomegranate and it was probably one of the best flavored pancakes I've ever eaten. I definitely suggest getting this flight if you can't choose from their selection.  The only problem I have is the portions are pretty small while the prices are fairly high. I was actually pretty hungry not too long after I ate.",

I ended up coming about an hour before they close and was able to get a seat at the bar straight away.   The mimosas are totally worth it. I think they were about $6 but they are big and you can tell there is enough champagne in there.   Highly recommend the eggs Benedict. I had the dui of Bella Bella benny and ham benedict III. The Bella Bella was my favorite. Definitely get the hash browns extra crispy... tastes way better.   There is so much to choose from and everything that came out of the kitchen looked delicious.",

We tried the pineapple upside down, pumpkin, and the pancake of the day, a lemon blueberry concoction which sounded like it had a lot going but it was by far the best of the three and the others weren't bad. Ordered a side of bacon and hash browns as well. Both delicious. The bacon was good hick cut and cooked perfectly for us and the hash browns had a slightly seasoned and onion taste. Again delicious!",

Every time I've been the servers are great and always able to give suggestions. I have had all of the eggs Benedict but my absolute favorite is the chiliquiles benedict! It's eggs benedict with salsa, barbacoa, and a stack of tortillas instead of an English muffin. Seriously delicious! If you can't decide which eggs Benedict you want you can do half and half.  Speaking of half and half, my boyfriend was deciding between 2 different french toasts and our server said he could do half of each. They seriously go above and beyond to make their customers happy and encourage customization.

I got the mmm mmm mimosa and that was amazing both of my friends got coffee one had ice coffee and the other had regular coffee and they both agreed that there coffee was good. Now when it came to the food I've had way better breakfast food the chocolate chip pancakes where just ok. My one friend had the breakfast pot pie she said she couldn't even justify now could it could've been because it was ice cold. My other friend had the Bella Bella Benny and the Benny good man and all she has to say was gross the hollandaise sauce had way to much mayonnaise in it and did nothing for it. The waitress was not that great ether it just really seemed like she didn't wanna be there maybe she was just having a bad day",

The food was 4/5 stars, the service was great, the prices were kind of high, and I will definitely go back. Oh! Also, they allow pets on the patio which is great for my dog -- he loves it! There are better local spots, but you probably won't be too disappointed here either way.",

The hollandaise sauce was thick, almost the consistency of nacho cheese you'd left sitting for a bit too long, and lacked the familiar spice or lemon zing you'd expect.   Snooze: ham Benedict (English muffin, ham, egg, hollandaise, shredded hash brown) 10.50; $13 out the door   Ncounter: farmers market eggs Benedict (English muffin, ham, avocado, sauteed spinach, tomato, egg, hollandaise, country style hash browns) 7.50, side of fruit (pineapple, grapes, cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, oranges) 3. $13 out the door",

    "text": "Stopped by Snooze AM Tempe last weekend, second visit to the chain and the first at this location.  Atmosphere - Nice layout, we had a table inside but would look to sit outside as the weather changes. My only dislike was having the A/C vents pointed right at some tables which made it too cold when it kicked on.  Service - Great. The estimated wait time was exactly what they quoted. The waitress was great in her very positive demeanor and her speed. Food came out very quick which was a plus.  Food - Really good and creative menu. Breakfast Pot Pie - Tasty and the perfect size for my wife, the crust is very flakey and gravy is good. Snooze Spuds Deluxe - Good dish and if I were to re-order I'd make two changes to my order. First, don't order the chorizo, it tasted nothing like chorizo and I even asked the waitress if it wasn't the chicken sausage but she confirmed it was chorizo. Second, take their recommendation to put an egg or two on top, without them it is a little too dry. I'd like to them to put on a little more cheese on it.  Overall, a very good place and I'm going up to four stars based on the service.",

Everyone else enjoyed their meals & they were very accommodating for my friend who doesn't do dairy. Sweet potato pancakes were a pleasant surprise.

There has been a wait every time I've been but never more than 30 min for 2 and they have a nice setup where you can sit and relax on the patio, play ping-pong, or play bags while you wait. The bar is also first come first serve if you happen to get lucky and spot someone leaving.  Starting with drinks, they have some really interesting sounding morning cocktails and fancy coffee drinks but so far I've just tried mimosas (grapefruit & orange) because they're fresh squeezed and you can't go wrong with a mimosa for brunch. They also have free coffee set up near the host stand to drink while you're waiting for a table.  The food is amazing. I've tried the Harvest Benedict. So good! I also got the Sandwich I Am with a pear pancake instead of the hashbrowns (you can sub for like $3 I think) and I would definitely recommend both of those as well.",

I also had the pecan pancakes. They are very large pancakes and can share with 3-4 people. Iced chai tea is really tasty. I ordered the \"sandwich I am\" on the menu because it sounded delicious with bacon, a fried egg, and hollindase sauce on a pretzel bun.. But somehow she put in a different breakfast sandwich instead. I ended up with the BEAT sandwich.. Served on cibatta bread with bacon, tomato, an egg, and aioli sauce. It was alright but I would preferred the one I ordered. Has browns are very crispy on the top and soft in the middle. They are generous with their sides of fruit.

The regular snooze coffee was good too. I had ordered the macchiato previously but wasn't a big fan and the server was kind enough to ask if I had liked it or wanted a regular instead. The server went above and beyond not rushing us and making suggestions she also was trying to put more umbrella on the patio outside for us and other customers.

Tip: If you have more than four in your party you might go elsewhere.    Tip for the management: If you have more attentive servers you'll speed along the dining and cut down the waiting time for other patrons.  Also, the manager should float around asking if everything is ok.  Or, at least have the servers check with the customer a couple of minutes after serving to see if all is ok.",

Something I like about Snooze is that their timelines are accurate for a wait. They also text you when your table is about to be ready. This location of this one is pretty small and it's right on campus. We made the mistake of saying first available and it was a hot day. They strategized well with with umbrellas and each table was under an umbrella. The still air didn't help the situation though and we were pretty hot while we ate. It really just took from our experience a bit since the food and service were still great. I had the lower east sider (I'm not sure if it's lower or upper) and it was great. My husband had the build your own omelette which he really enjoyed (again). We both shared the cinnamon roll pancake which is thee best pancake ever!

When I come here with a friend we like to split the gluten free pancake flight and regular 2 egg breakfast. My friend has celiac disease and they are very accommodating. The gluten free pancakes are just as good as the regular ones, super fluffy and sweet. Make sure to ask about some of the flavors that aren't listed on the menu, the cinnamon roll and sweet potato are my personal favorites. The hashbrowns and eggs are also spot on.",

My girl friend and I went in to get some breakfast and couldn't have been more impressed with the service and the food. I'm 99% sure the girl that served us was named Parker and she did such a great job at making us feel welcome and she put a smile on both of our faces! I have worked in the food industry for most of my working career and its very hard to find good service. Not with Parker! I will definitely be coming back and very soon!! And if its possible I'm asking for the same server! :)  (I really hope I got the girls name right...?)",

First the good, I had the corned beef hash which was very tasty and so much better then the standard hash you get from most breakfast places. At the table we also had eggs benedict which were great, and the french toast was some of the best I've ever had. The coffee was above average for a breakfast place, and the prices overall were reasonable. The juices tasted freshly squeezed the overall quality of the food was great.  Apparently there is often an hour wait when ASU is in session, but with school out the wait was only 10 minutes or so.  Now to the aforementioned downside. My partner ordered some chorizo along with his breakfast. When we got the bill he was charged double the amount listed on the menu. When he brought it up to the waitress she got the manager who pointed out a section on the back part of the menu where the same item was shown with the increased price, then attempted to explain why sometimes it costs more and sometimes it cost less. When he pointed out there was nothing on the menu to indicate one vs the other we got a big eye-roll, shrug and the manager left without another word. It was only a difference of a couple dollars on a 60 dollar tab and an easy fix for the manager but the blow off left us annoyed and unlikely to come back, despite the quality of the food.",

We were seated outside at a beautiful table, and as we walked to the table we were assured that although the there was no umbrella over the table currently, they would be moving one to alleviate the Phoenix sun.   After our waitress took our drink order, we were basically told we were moving inside due to not being able to move an umbrella. SHANNON was very rude in her delivery of the news and never apologized or recognized the error in their lack of hospitality. The new waitress more than made up for the rudeness of SHANNON and our meal was delicious. However, the incident in moving our party of 5 hung over our meal.   Another authoritative member of the staff did bring a complimentary plate of pancakes that we were not terribly interested in having since 4 out of 5 of our party had already ordered pancakes. Again, still without apology.   Restaurants are not solely about food, but experience. SHANNON could use some training in her understanding of a full dining experience.",

But no way will I snooze through the morning anymore after eating at this amazing restaurant!  After visiting Snooze for the first time in Phoenix and experienced the most amazing brunch ever, I just had to take my mom. We visited this location on a gloomy Sunday. It was raining earier but when we arrived the rain had stopped and the sun peaked through the clouds. The host took my name and number and told us the wait was about 45 minutes. We walked on over to the art festival Mill was holding untill I received a text that our table was ready.  After 45 minutes we were seated outside, which we didn't mind at all. I ordered a cappuccino with almond milk and my mom had a cup of coffee to start with. The cappuccino wasn't bad but wasn't amazing either. I actually really liked my mom's coffee more. After our drinks I ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie with the OMG! French Toast on the side. Mom got the Winter Harvest Bene with a side order of the Pineapple Upside down Pancakes.  By the time our server came out with our food the rain had started to pour. I was excited to dig it but the wind was super intense and started to damper the mood. I ask the waitress if we could sit inside as soon as there was a table available. She was very understanding and said yes of course. Less then 5 minutes later a outdoor umbrella comes crashing down towards our table. I let out a scream and held up my hand to keep it from falling on my face. A handful of servers witness this including our's. She quickly grabbed our plates and told us we're moving inside ASAP. We were seated promptly indoors and I was given ice and offered pain medicine for my hand. I'm thinking through all of this \"Man, when will I be able to dig into my French toast???? *cries*\".  Finally after getting situated we were able to fully enjoy our food. The puff pastry on my plate was amazingly pooffy and the sunny side up egg was on point. The gravy wasn't bad but I felt like it could use an extra something to make it special. The hash browns had the perfect crispy to soft texture ratio too. But honestly none of that really mattered after biting into the French toast. The warm mascarpone sandwiched between the perfectly toasted bread was outstanding. The caramel sauce on top was by far my favorite thing out of everything. You don't need syrup for this masterpiece of a dish! My mom loved her Bene  although wished the eggs were a bit more runny. I tried her pancakes and again you don't need syrup for them either. They were light and almost melted in your mouth. Probably the best pancakes I've ever had, yum!   My overall experience here wasn't so great because of the rain. But the manager and our server handled it well. The manager covered our check and followed up the next day to make sure I was okay. The food though, was totally on point for me! I for sure will be back, just not on a rainy day, haha ^^;;",

Well today, while doing breakfast with some friends, the waiter let us know we could get the hash browns mashed down and fried crispy. i didn't get any but some of my friends did and they are everything a breakfast hash brown should be, flattened out and crispy all over. I asked if this was a new thing and the wait person told me no, it was always available and not listed so you have to ask for it.  Well Snooze, knowing that I can get my hash browns the way I want them kicks you up a star. In addition, it was my first time eating at the outside tables and wow, it was so nice outside, what a great way to start the day.",

We got sat in the area where the bartender served us. Not sure why but no big deal. We quickly ordered because I had to get to the airport. The staff was very busy rolling silverware, eating their own breakfasts, hanging out by the coffee station talking about their last nights experiences, laughing, having a great time. We however waited a very long time for our food. I asked the manager if he could check on it because it was taking so long, he went in the back and the food came right out... hmm. He did not come back over and ask if everything was ok or apologize. Actually no-one said anything about it. Our server was not at all attentive once we got our food and didn't thank us when she brought the check. No one said a word to us when we were leaving. The food was good but we definitely did not feel welcome and if you have anywhere to be don't go early during the week.

I immediately noticed the fun decor they used for the inside, I really enjoyed the retro/60s vibe they had going on. They had a fairly wide selection on their menu, which I appreciated, there were vegan/ gluten free option.s The food came out at an average speed, I got the corned beef hash, my friend had pancakes of sorts. I was fairly unimpressed by the corned beef hash, it was fairly unoriginal. The beef was masked by the potatoes, and the portion was super small. My friend raved about her pancakes though, so they were able to make up for it there. I would return, but I definitely wouldn't order the hash again.",

We asked the waiter if we could order our food (after about 20 minutes) and he said the bar was backed up (even though a table that sat after us already had theirs).  My friend who was pregnant and about to eat her arm ordered orange juice and when the waiter brought our mimosas, I told him she didn't get her juice and he acted annoyed with me.  I get that everyone has a bad day, but he never apologized for our wait (our food took a while too).  I have told this story to a few other people and they said that's the restaurants MO.  They are known for bad service?  I am usually not one to write bad reviews, but I thought the owners might want to know.   **Side-note: if you order the breakfast burrito, do not order the green sauce unless you like super spicy food!

I ordered the corn beef hash with poached eggs.  The hash came out blackened and bland.  The poached eggs were hard cooked rather than runny - the server brought me the correctly cooked eggs very quickly - props to her!  Like Jensen M who wrote a review on the same day, our wait was really long, not just the wait to be seated, but the wait for our food.  We waited more than 45 minutes just for the food.  The manager stopped by to thank us for being patient.  He said he had been keeping an eye on us.  That was cool. I could tell he had been \"keeping an eye\" on most of the tables in the restaurant as we all were waiting a really long time for our food.  I have worked in a restaurant and understand that some days are difficult, especially during the first month of being open.  I would try the place again.  I definitely would come back for the chai!",

The restaurant (and the one right next door) are in  a converted original ASU building so there is cool architecture with lots of exposed brick. It's literally right behind Mona Aquatic Center (think ASU swim meets) and occasionally you'll see high divers practicing right behind the building.   Eat there on a morning when it's good to eat outside. That's the best experience. Nice waiters and well informed. Food is good and not just traditional bacon and eggs. Very attractive crowd at breakfast though you may find a long wait during really popular times on a Saturday or Sunday morning..",

She was very attentive and made sure we got all of our orders just the way we wanted them. She even sent over a gluten free pineapple pancake for me on the house! This was totally unexpected because I didn't mention my allergy but she  noticed I specified corn tortillas instead of flour. The pancake was divine and I was so appreciative of her doing that. After dining at many other breakfast locations in the Phoenix area, Snooze is by far the most exceptional in accommodating their guests and I will definitely be back soon!",

Not only is it located in a trendy area near ASU, but the whole place is well-branded with their logo on everything. They had coffee available while you wait for a table. At 10AM on a Saturday, we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table for 3. The coffee and donut pancakes were amazing -- made with Granny Smith apples and served with a coffee cream to be used like syrup. My sister got a breakfast sandwich on a pretzel bun, which was unique and good. Their hash brown were also really good. Very friendly service! Highly recommended.",

This is one of those restaurants I'll go to if I have the extra cash for a every-few-months treat. They have a laid back, somewhat retro atmosphere. Waits are never too long.   Their pancakes are fluffy with a variety of new, interesting flavors to choose from. I tried the Blueberry Danish  and a couple of others, although the Blueberry Danish sticks out in my mind the most. Sweet blueberries and tart lemon actually compliment each other very nicely.   I'm also not a fan of overly-dressed up hash browns (Snooze's include onions and spices which can be somewhat overwhelming, if I remember correctly. Honestly, it could have just been the day we went.). That's not to say that their hash browns are bad (they definitely aren't!), I'm just more of a purist when it comes to my potatoes. Give me salt and pepper.   I'd say give Snooze a visit at least once to try their unique menu and come to your own conclusion.",

Others in my party ordered americanos or other fancy coffee from the barrista (which I am normally all about) but I just got their house coffee, which was great. But I am partial to just getting drip coffee when I do brunch.  I got their breakfast tacos (highly recommend) + bacon on top.

Kylie was nothing short of a great person in general but also the best waitress we've ever had. She was ontop of everything and had a great personality. My family and i agreed that we will now always request her as our waitress! So to the manager of Snooze, you should definitely offer a life time supply of pinnaple pancakes and a beer on the house for Kylie for her exceptional service!",

The only negative I have is that the music was a little too loud, as it often is at these modern hipster joints. I like being able to have a conversation with my meal companions and I kept having to ask the hubby to repeat himself.

    "text": "Well, I'm sick. Walked out of the restaurant 10 minutes ago after eating maybe one eighth of my \"Ham Benedict III\" and I am physically sick. And that's literally not even the only bad part of the experience that I am taking a break from puking right now to write about. I want to make clear that the coffee is decent though, I love a good iced mocha from here, and the barista is doing a good job in the midst of a landfill.  So the waiter literally walked up to us and just stood there and smiled until one of us at the table said, \"Hey how is it going?\". One of the creepiest waiters ever, and then he said, \"Do you want to hear about our pancake?\", we replied with, \"Sure\" and then the guy did not even know what was in the pancake.  Food comes out and nothing better happens. My plate literally smelled like body odor, I don't know if it's just the hollandaise or what, but it was repulsive. Then we don't see the guy forever and then when he comes back and no one has eaten anything but some hash browns, he says, \"Do you guys need a box?\". Our cards are already out and on the table, come on dude no we want to get out of here before we actually puke on the floor.  I have had bad experiences here before with under cooked eggs and just weird guy servers who sit down next to you to take your order but it's just so close to home and school that I keep finding myself going there out of convenience but never again, not after being sick for food that is not even appetizing.  Bottom line is, the food is not good, the service is trash, there is almost always a ridiculous wait which still perplexes me, I would not recommend this place to any one, and honestly, if you don't offer Frank's Red Hot as one of your hot sauces you are already a garbage establishment.  Snooze, when you read this, please leave this location so something better can come in and use the spot. Thanks for nothing.",

She made sure we got everything we needed, and she topped it off w/ some tasty beverages, my BMary included.  I had scrambled eggs, hash browns and sausage pattie. Menu says 3 eggs, though the serving looked more like 2. Hash browns were tasty, but not as crispy as iike them, and the sausage was alright.  I added pico de gallo to my plate, and it balanced the flavors for me instantly. The rest of the family enjoyed their breakfasts, the pancakes and bfast tacos very well received, and we all left satisfied. I'll return!  Cheers! RS",

    "text": "Holy deliciousness. I came here for the breakfast pot pie, and was sold on the pancakes and cocktails. Let me back up... the breakfast pot pie was good, but I wouldn't say it was 'great'. There was nothing wrong with it, it just had a few spices that don't match my tastes. Loved that it was in a puff pastry though, and that you get to choose the type of egg you want on top! Also, major bonus points at Snooze for being able to swap out different sides to customize your dish without it impacting the price- probably the best part about Snooze as a whole. I really wanted corned beef hash (which was A-MAZING) so I subbed out the regular hash browns for that instead.  Anyways, THE PANCAKES. I got a single blueberry danish pancake as a side to my pot pie, and oh my gosh I wish I had gotten a full stack. Normally, when you get sweetly flavored pancakes, they are super, supppppper sweet - you can hardly taste the pancake underneath. This was not the case at all at Snooze. This was the fluffiest, tastiest buttermilk pancake with a delicious light and sweet lemon cream cheese filling. The streusel, sweet cream, and blueberry topping are lightly drizzled over the top. No overkill at all - the perfect light enhancement to the delicious buttermilk of the pancake.  For beverage, if you don't get the mountain mule, you are severely missing out. This might have been the best breakfast cocktail I've ever had in my life, and I'm a big fan of brunch, so thats saying A LOT.  I will DEFINITELY be making Snooze a regular in my brunch rotation... I may even go back next weekend.",

When I read my friend Andrew's review of this place and in his words, \"every town has a \"best brunch spot\" and this may very well be Phoenix(area)'s\", I was super excited to find out that this place was within walking distance from my hotel, Tempe Mission Palms.   When we walked in, we immediately felt old. Everyone inside was like 25 or younger. Oh well, I didn't feel out of place. The hostess and the waitress were super nice. Our waitress even brought us out a \"gift\", a pineapple upside down pancake. Thank you, Abbie. Now our trip complete. My friend doesn't usually eat breakfast, but she talked out this meal for hours.   They have several morning drinks available, including three versions of bloody marys. I played it safe and stuck with the basic one which was $.75 less anyways. For my meal, I ordered the Snooze breakfast burrito and requested the sauce and pico on the side. It was stuffed with scrambled eggs, hash browns, and black beans and was excellent. I'd say it was the best breakfast burrito I've ever had. I was hesitant in ordering it because of the potatoes, but they weren't greasy at all. My friend ordered The Snooze Classic which included farm fresh cage-free eggs cooked any style and a choice of ham, bacon, sausage, chorizo, pulled pork, chicken sausage or soyrizo, hash browns, choice of toast. She said that her entire experience was life-changing.   I agree this is \"the\" breakfast spot in the Phoenix area.",

    "text": "This place is unbelievable. Whether you are a local or a tourist you'll enjoy your meal at Snooze. Our hotel concierge recommended \"anything on the menu\" and we were not disappointed. I started with the Bangkok Bloody Mary which I have to say is one of the best, most flavorful and interesting cocktails I've ever had. The Bangkok was served with some sort of yumminess (better than salt) sprinkled on the rim and pickled veggies on top. Of course I had a hard time ordering food because ever looked so amazing! I chose the pick any two of the eggs benedict and chose chili verde and steak and eggs. They were both very tasty and even better with the local hot sauce. I preferred the chili verde. The restaurant alone is a reason to come back to AZ. Outstanding food, location, and service. Indoor and outdoor dining options.",

This place filled up quickly, but everyone seems as though they got sat pretty quickly  I started off with a cocktail of grapefruit juice, sparkling wine, and tequila. I can't remember the name of this drink, but it was pretty tasty and not super sweet. I then decided to get the Snooze Spuds Deluxe because it seemed to have everything else I wanted squeezed into one dish (potatoes, cheese, eggs, veggies, and meat). I added spinach, bacon, ham, and jack cheese to mine with over easy eggs. A few people ordered pancakes, so I got to try some of theirs.   My Spuds were delicious. They were very flavorful and filling. It was basically a mix of a hash, omelette, and over easy eggs. A perfect combination in my opinion. I also got to try the french toast (good, but not a fan of coconut) and the cinnamon bun pancake. Oh my god....that cinnamon bun pancake was so amazing. I only needed 1 pancake.   You're near the campus, so I'm guessing a lot of people working there were students, but they all were great and handled our large party very well. I will come back .",

I'm still drooling thinking about. While I was sitting there I started chatting with an employee about what pancake someone was eating nearby and he was so thoughtful he brought me one on the house. I haven't had customer service like that in a long time. It was the blueberry danish. I would definitely recommend that pancake that was fluffy and full of flavor.

I have since been at least a few times and have some more to say   I haven't seen anyone talking about their shrimp and grits but it's really good! Perfectly spicy. I'm saying that as someone from NOLA!   The hot chocolate is also delicious! Strong recommend!   The sweet potato pancake is a must! We have ordered it a la carte and it was worth the almost $5. I couldn't have 3 myself just because I can't handle that must sticky, thick sweet. The pancake itself has the perfect amount of sweet though. Sometimes we get it in the flight if we are really feeling ambitious. It goes well with the pineapple upside down!    I will say their hash browns really aren't something to call home about. It's the only part of the meal I felt we could've done without.   Service was good, prompt, kind. Seated outside which can sometimes be hazardous (they have bee problems like everywhere else in Tempe). It's a good place to take someone to Brunch if you want to seem hip.",

    "text": "I've been to the other one in Gilbert, but this one is quite a different feel. I think it might habe to do with the location being on ASU's campus, so it's a bit \"collegey\". The decor is cute and classy but it definitely caters more to a college scene.  My friend at for breakfast at 8am and it was about 80% occupied for the indoor seating. No one was out on the patio seating area as yet because it was a tad too chilly still. By the time we left though, the line was out the door onto the sidewalk at almost 10am.  I ordered the Benny duo (one of each type of eggs benedict) with the Bella! Bella! Benny and the Chili Verde Benedict with pulled pork. So the chili sauced tortilla that they had as the \"bread\" for the Chili Verde Benedict was very different, but I wasn't too sold on it. It might be the texture or the corn tortilla flavor overpowering the rest of the benedict... it wasn't a hit for me. The hollandaise, egg and pulled pork though were pretty good. For the Bella! Bella! Benny, the slice of ciabata bread it came on was so thin and just underwhelming. The prosciutto, egg and hollandaise sauce again were spot on. But with how salty prosciutto is, I felt like there should be a more hearty piece/type of bread to balance out that natural saltiness of the prosciutto.   The meal came with hash browns which to me was the only perfect (for me) item on my plate. The outside brown and crisp on the outside, moist and cooked just right on the inside. My other complaint is that they neither have blue cheese dressing nor ranch dressing/dipping sauce, and those are my sauces of choice for potatoes (I don'tlike ketchup).  Another thing is Snooze changes their menu, but it always has a lot of similarities to the one before. It's like they remix items that are on the menu. They have a lot of great ideas and sometimes they're great (like their fall menu was) and sometimes they fall short - like the current menu.",

The table ordered the deluxe Benedicts half steak and eggs and the other ham. The steak Benedict's is a must try. The meat was extremely tender and flavorful it was served with harsh browns and veggies. It's also topped with holiday sauce and green toppings that tasted like pesto. I wish I ordered just the steak. Instead of bread it's served with something else that's amazing. The ham Benedict was good too.  We also tried three pancakes the pineapple upside down, blueberries, and another one that tasted like amazing dessert. There small but man it's a great portion. Their version of small is the size of my hand.   Overall great breakfast spot but get ready for a wait.",

    "text": "This place is absolutely fantastic. Came on a recommendation from a friend and I'm probably not going to add anything many other reviews on here have said.   Fantastic options for breakfast and brunch here.  Multiple Benedict options they even let you mix-and-match presentations. Pancakes are ridiculous the blueberry danish and pineapple upside down cake pancakes are sweet perfection.  Again they let you do a pancake trio so you can try multiple flavor options.  I had the breakfast pot pie.  Fluffy pastry filled with  rosemary sausage gravy and topped with an egg prepared to your choice. My friends had the breakfast burrito, the breakfast tacos, (both huge), as well as the Benedict's.  Highly recommend adding one of the pancakes (I had the blueberry danish one).  Friendly staff here to give recommendations, very clean, great vibe in this place.",

    "text": "After having been to Snooze AM in Tempe twice, my verdict is that it leaves much to be desired.  The first experience I had was absolutely horrible. We waited for about half an hour and were seated on the patio. Although the weather was okay, it got hot really quick since there was absolutely no shade. There were dogs on the patio which is fine, but what did not sit well with me was that the waiters were picking them up and then delivering food to tables. The dog that was at the table right next to ours was small & not trained as he kept peeing on the ground. Like I said, one of the waitresses kept picking him up & playing with him while serving tables. Complete turnoff!  On top of that, the food we got wasn't impressive. My date got the breakfast burrito & I got the omelette with spinach, mushrooms, & cheese. I ordered white bread and not once, but twice, our waitress brought me sourdough! We aren't pleased with any of it.  The second time I went, it was with a large group & we opted to get a table inside. The wait time was horribly long but we knew that would most likely be the case. The service was spot on. Our waitress was great in getting us everything we needed, kept our cups refilled, etc. The food was much better. I got the Benny Duo with the Bella! Bella! Benny and the Benny Goodman which came with hash browns. The Benny's were just okay - the Bella was better than the other one, but the prosciutto has a weird taste as did the salmon lox. Keep in mine their hash browns aren't of the crispy variety.  I will have to give it up for the pancakes that we received to share! The Pineapple Upside Down Pancake was one of the best things I did ever have! There were chunks of pineapple cooked inside the pancake which was topped with a vanilla sauce & cinnamon butter. I would highly recommend this!!! If you're a fan of peanut butter, try the peanut butter cup pancake! The flight is really sweet so if you're looking for something a little bit less sweet, try the French toast!  I think I'll be returning to Snooze for the pancakes and perhaps the French toast .. But probably not this location.",

And, seeing as how I won't get my fix until my next trip out west in May, I made the most of it with a pancake flight (blueberry Danish, pineapple upside down cake and molten chocolate lava).  Seriously the best gluten free pancakes EVER and the pineapple upside down was hands down the favorite.  Also, I love that they have gluten free toast for the benedicts, and that you can mix and match.  I got the Bella Benny and one with lox.  Perfectly seasoned everything, and my only regret is again, that there isn't one in my hometown.  If you don't have a Snooze near you, you owe it to yourself to make a trip when you find one near!",

It was super busy and the experience wasn't as great as I had that next Tuesday. I think it was just because it was so crowded. The great thing about this place is that they text you the link of their app. The app shows up exactly how many \"parties\" are ahead of you and what the estimated time of wait is. It's amazing! I wish more restaurants did this. Anyway, the second visit I got the Benny's. THEY LET YOU COMBINE BENNYS ON ONE PLATE! genius. I got the Bella Bella Benny and Benny goodman. The BENNYS also come with hash browns (you can ask them to make them crispy!!) Yum!! The coffee is also surprisingly light and amazing. I liked the regular coffee better than a mocha latte, which is saying something. I'll keep coming back but preferably during the week. Service is also EXCEPTIONAL. They are attentive and customer oriented. On the patio, they made sure the sun wasn't in my eyes. If you're also not satisfied with the food, they'll go above and beyond to make sure you had a positive experience.",

    "text": "My heart was broken. Still bleeding, I found myself on a seven day sojourn in Denver. Looking to get lost for a while. Looking for a tourniquet. It was that trip, and the encouragement of a dear friend that opened my eyes to the beautifully unexpected marvel that is SNOOZE. I didn't know then that that experience would change my life, but what I did know was that the OMG French Toast, friendly faces, prompt service, and gallon of coffee were exactly what I needed after a loooong night trying to un-torture my past. I wandered aimlessly through the great city the next 6 days. I was a sponge. The gentle hum, the drugs, the fairer sex, the wind, steel butting against rock, all of it. Soaked it all in. They say the sponge has no nervous, digestive, or circulatory systems. I could relate that week. However, in a seven day stretch of desolate whimsy with no clear direction, I found one constant. SNOOZE. Sweet, savory, and made with pride. A game changer in the world of breakfast.     I returned home to Chicago. The scar was slow to heal, but my life would go on. Good days, bad days, days so uninspiring you can't even classify them, whatever. A rut was developing. I needed something new.     I settled in Scottsdale, AZ. I have no idea why, but here I was and I  found some fast friends. After what can only be described as one of the more epic nights in recorded drunken history a friend suggested we work off our hangovers at Snooze.     Wait....  What?  There's a Snooze here?  Are you fu**ing with me?   She was not. Once Google confirmed her story to be True, I ran out of the house as if it was on fire. I drove down to Tempe. Alone. I wanted this experience for myself. The whole 15 minute trip I fantasized about breakfast burritos, Bennys, pancakes, Micheladas, EVERYTHING! The car was floating. I was floating. I was about to be reunited with an old friend I thought I would only ever see in the city of Denver. I didn't want to pinch myself for fear of waking up.     I walked in. It was different. Not in a bad way. Just different. More open, airy, better lighting, a lot of Dr. Dog on the stereo. The smells were the same. The smiles were bigger. I liked it immediately. I sat down at the bar. Continuing to look around and soak it all in. I was a sponge again and all of the emotions of my lost week in Denver flooded back into my brain. There was pain, but there was more excitement. I was ready. I knew what I wanted.    This is when my life changed. Forever.   I haven't been to all of the Snooze's in the country, but I don't have to visit them all to tell you that Snooze Tempe has something the rest of them don't. Her name is Parker. The wild card. She's an X-factor the other locations could only dream of having. Shortly after sitting down she was right in front of me. I ordered coffee, and then it goes blank. I was lost. More like trapped. Trapped in the beautiful abyss of her eyes. I bet a thousand men have been told what the pancake of the day is, yet never truly heard the words coming out of her mouth. I gathered myself and continued to look around. Soaking everything in. I was studying the food of everyone around me, watching the staff interact, listening to the stories being told of last night. I never wanted it to end. It was pure magic, and in the center of it all was Parker and her smile that could make the world stop. I ate, we laughed, the music played, and eventually like all things do, it ended. I may never see Parker again, or eat the delicious tacos or pancakes at Snooze, but the beauty and warmth felt that morning changed me. Reinvigorated me. A meal at Snooze is not just a meal. It's an experience. I now realize that's what dragged me back there every morning in Denver, and will most likely make me return to SNOOZE TEMPE a lot more in the future.   Thank you Parker, and thank you Snooze. You woke something inside of me, and for that I'm eternally grateful.",

    "text": "We went 2 days in a row the first day we went in the afternoon, I got loaded hash browns with green chile sauce (medium spice level) and sausage, he got a duo of eggs benedict one benny goodman and one ham benedict III no complaints and since it was so late we had our run of the place.  We enjoyed it so much we went again today this time in the morning.  I had corned beef hash without the egg and I think it needed something in place of the egg it just didn't feel complete, I opted to switch my toast for a blueberry danish pancake if I had any complaints it would be that there was to little of the lemon cream cheese.  He had another benedict duo this time he had the Bella! Bella! Benny and the caprese benny the hash was cooked to a golden perfection and both of us cleaned our plates. The service was great the atmosphere was great and the place was packed to the point where we had to sit at the high top seating or wait for a table, we opted to sit by the window which was a great view but the vents face directly at this stretch of seating so it's chilly and windy, next time I'd probably sit at the bar instead. All in all great food, service,  experience I'm sure we'll go back the next time we're in phoenix.",

    "text": "Have been to snooze two times and each visit has not been far from impressive.  I have been a server for nine years so I try to be very understanding of the potential for things to go wrong within the restaurant, but a good attentive server whom is apologetic when things do go wrong can save a bad visit.  Each time I have been to snooze the servers are far from accommodating and unfriendly.  Today my friend and I came into eat and the visit started as an average experience.  We ordered quickly and the bartender was prompt.  Our food however took along time to come out, about 25-30 minutes and when it arrived both plates of good were very cold.  It took us about five minutes to track down a different employee to send it back. While we waited for our plates to be remade we were not offered refills on empty drinks or offered another bar drink. The plates than took another 20 minutes to be remade.  I was appreciative that the manager came and apologized and offered to take care of our entrees.  When one of the bartenders came and dropped the tab she said well as the meals were taken care of so hope that made you happy.  It was a very snide and rude remark and first of all we didn't want the meal comped.  We wanted hot food and in a timely fashion. Needless to say after her comment I will no longer return to snooze. I can make a better, more pleasant breakfast at home and I would rather give my business to a more pleasant and deserving staff.",

The first time I went there was a 45 minute wait, but hey it was a busy Saturday morning and I was okay with that and the food was good and I overall had a good experience, the food was tasty, however then I went today (2/16/15) and it was a 15 minute wait, and then when I went in the hostess at the front said her partner would be back to seat us in a moment. After she said that, a new party came in and then the lady who came to seat us despite being told there are two parties only took the group that came in after us. When she returned another group had come in and the lady began prepping for that party to be seated (again ignoring us) and when the other person in my party asked about that she said in a snippy, rude tone \"yes, i just sent you a text!\" (she hadn't, we'd been waiting after having received the message that our table was ready for about 5-10 minutes) and then seated the second party to arrive after us. Then a different person took us to our table, finally. Ultimately, that woman (working at 10:30, who was seating people) was incredibly rude, and the experience was awful and we ended up leaving because that one person gave me such a horrible time. I truly hope this was an isolated experience and that she will learn some people skills. It's really sad because I had such a good experience the first time. We left and went to ncounter and enjoyed the rest of our day.",

They close at 2:30 and we arrived right around 12:30 on a week day, dining room was less than half occupied and the patio was maybe at 60% occupancy. We could see plenty of management just sitting around at tables not doing much other than talking with each other. Our food took about 35 mins to come out, okay but all of our egg and potato dishes came out ice cold. It was clear our plates had been sitting in the expo window for plenty of time. Come on management you're supposed to be leading a team, go and help your servers run some food. Big shoutout to our server though Toast Malone, really nice guy and could see our frustration, my 2 stars are for him, otherwise it would be a one. Thanks Snooze for a good first experience, please take note to there name, you definitely wanna sleep on this place.",

First of all, the decor is really cute and trendy. For lack of a better way to phrase it, it feels very college. Not surprising since it's located so close to ASU. We immediately loved the feel of the place. The menu has sooooo many good things on it so it was a struggle to decide what to order. Both of us ended up ordering the Spuds Deluxe. I got mine with bacon, ham, and red peppers. It was so delicious! The hash browns were fantastic and the meat was all well cooked but not overdone. I'd come here again in a heartbeat and I can't wait to do so so I can try more items on the menu. The pancakes and French toast sound extremely tasty!",

There was a 25 minute wait as expected so we decided to sit at the bar and start the morning off with a Mimosa. First incredible surprise with a sparking champagne and orange juice. We talked to our barstool neighbor who happened to be an employee. I thought if he comes into work for breakfast this is going to be really good. At his suggestion my wife had an egg white omelette with spinach, mushrooms, and chicken sausage. It was a Home rum. I went with the breakfast burrito with sausage and topped with green chili. It was a spectacular. The restaurant is next door to ASU so it was full of college students which created a really great vibe with graduation season in full effect. Oh yeah we had a blueberry pancake with a cream cheese center that was sinful. This place is awesome.",

As soon as you walk in, everything is vibrant from the decor to the friendly staff.  Everyone was exceptional from a service stand point.   They have so many speciality cocktails and while I didn't get to try one this time around they are definitely in my radar for next time.  That's right....there will most certainly be a next time!!!!   I ordered the \"OMG French Toast\" and they did pack quite the flavor punch.   They come with mascarpone butter and a Carmel syrup glaze tops with fresh strawberries and coconut shavings.  While the serving wasn't large it was just right since towards the end of the meal it was getting almost too sweet too sugary.  So be warned of your not big into sweet stuff.      Prices are a tad on the higher side, but nothing that was a deal breaker. You can at least tell that the increase in cost goes to fresh ingredients and excellent attention to detail in the little things.    I hear they might be opening one in downtown Gilbert and can't wait as that's a little closer for me, but either way I will be coming back to taste other delightful items on the menu and throwback some cocktails!!! SUNDAY FUNDAY DONE RIGHT!!!!",

The Chilaquiles were served as two croquet type servings, two tortillas with the toppings piled high on top. The helping of Barbacoa was fairly generous and really tender. The egg was done perfectly and the fresh chopped tomato salsa was really fresh. They aren't spicy but some Jalapeno Tobasco helped with that. I felt the portion was just right but if you're really hungry make sure you get hash browns on the side to fill up.   The Bloody Mary was OK. The mix they use is somewhat thick and spicy wasn't really that spicy. They also use a lot of pepper which I'm not personally a big fan of.   My wife got the Pot Pie which she devoured. The crust was soft and flaky and the gravy had great consistency as well. She had a mimosa with cranberry and lemonade and absolutely loved it.   We will definitely be back!",
