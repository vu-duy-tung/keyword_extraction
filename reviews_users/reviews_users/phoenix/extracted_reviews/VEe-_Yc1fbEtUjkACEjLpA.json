    "text": "My boyfriend and I visited The District during restaurant week and were quite pleased by our experience! The food was very yummy, I had pork tenderloin with applesauce & mac n cheese- sounds simple, but oh-so-yummy when done creatively! My man had the short rib, which was also delish, and quite a large serving. Dessert was also delicious, we had the lemon cheesecake and the s'mores- delightful! Then they brought us cotton candy with the check! Fun little surprise to end your meal! The waiter said it was because @ their grand opening they had cotton candy and people were disappointed when they took it away, so now it was his privilege to deliver cotton candy with every check! The wine that came with the AZ restaurant week menu was also quite good, and the overall decor of the restaurant was lovely and modern. Overall, great experience! I'd probably go back!",

Reading the few bad ones it came to me that these people are big box haters like myself. So, I had it in my mind this was going to be another overpriced hotel restaurant.  But, here I am ready to tell you that the hype is True! This place was really good. Really. We came in with out a reservation and it was busy. After a short wait we sat. My first impression was this was a fine dining type deal, but turns out it is pretty casual.  Drink menu first. Impressive beer list on draft all for $3.75! I remember reading reviews of this place being expensive? Where were these people going? My friend ordered a drink special (who has those?!) some kind of delicious infused rum elixir. The sangria was pretty good too. And the beer, yay!!!  The menu was pretty straight forward. All of it sounded pretty yummy, and no words that we didn't understand. We ordered some starters: Po' boy sliders, baked cheese, duck quesadilla and sweet potato tots. Don't know which my favorite was that's how good they all were! Most interesting was the quesadilla served with apple butter. I had the lobster pirogi, awesome! My friends had the bbq'd pork, salmon and blackened halibut. All you heard was ooo's, ah's and mmm's.  If you have been hearing the buzz about downtown and want to check it for yourself go to District. It is easily the best I've tried. I'm going back in for lunch this week! Oh, and free valet! Thats right free....",

The food came impossibly fast. The shrimp and Sausage Po Boy sliders were heavenly. The bread is this roll type of joy like break back east. Yum. You know the type of bread you can't find in AZ or west of the Rockies as Al Pacino would say-lol!They also served the bread basket with a veggie type of garnish if mixed with butter and put on the bread it had a very pleasing taste to it. Innovative menu- Lobster Potpie and Duck Quesadillas. HMMMMMM! Interesting. I had a side of Mac and cheese which is what I had heard about for so long and a Caprese Salad. My friend had divine Salmon. I am not a Salmon fan but i tasted it and it was yummers. My Ice tea was tasty and my friend had  a Basil Mojito that was mixed well. I don't like them usually because they are so strong mouthwashy tasting, but this had a nice blend to it. The restaurant decor is beautiful.We did not get desert but I want to go back and try those Seasalt sticks. All in all I loved going here. DT was packed last night due to Wrestle-Mania but we were in and out  in an hour at 5ish, so try that time to avoid crowds. Service was great despite other reviews. I know great service and I had it.",

    "text": "I went to District for happy hour for the second time. After an unimpressive first try, I was surprised my friend suggested it again. Happy hour is until 7...one bonus, I guess. And our server was very nice. We tried the sweet potato fries, chips & dip and mac & cheese. It was all just so bland. The sweet potato fries need something, can they get some tips from Fez? The queso with the Lay's potato chips was a cold dip that had a milky consistency. And it didn't taste like cheese. Maybe I just do not have the sophisticated palette to understand what the goal was there. The cheese of the mac and cheese also was a bland, thin consistency.   I want to like this place because it's within walking distance of my house and across from the movie theater, which is how I ended up here reluctantly for a second time. I do not think the decor is as amazingly chic as people state. It is very nice, but it is a hotel bar. Maybe I can't judge too harshly because I haven't tried the dinner menu but if you f*** up mac and cheese and sweet potato fries I do not have a lot of hope. Not worth the time or money with so many great local restaurants in the vicinity.",

    "text": "My regional manager was in town for a couple of days & was staying at the Sheraton downtown. I have heard mixed reviews about the District but thought I would check it out for myself...what a mistake! Please know, my manager loves all the great non-chain places (Vig, Postino, etc) I take her to when she comes to Phoenix so all the more disappointing to have such a terrible meal.  I will start by saying the service was great & prompt. The bread before dinner was yummy but it all went downhill from there. There were 3 of us & we all had different meals ( Short ribs, lobster pasta & steak) & all 3 were horribly salty. After a couple of bites I realized the taste of my short ribs closely resembled the smell of a sour/dirty sponge!  Our server offered to bring us all something different but by that point we were all so tired & turned off we opted not to have her go through the trouble. The manager also came by & offered dessert or anything else we wanted which was nice & earned them the stars. Our entire dinner was taken care of by the manager with the exception of my pineapple mojito which was good, but we all went to bed hungry that night.  So if you are in the area & looking for a place to have drinks then it is great spot for that but I would avoid the food.",

The menu's got a couple weird things on it and they're seafood selections remind me why I should strictly adhere to my \"don't eat seafood at restaurants in the desert.\"  My colleague couldn't even eat his spaghetti and meatballs it was so bad.  My cedar plank salmon with a honey glaze was clearly frozen and the glaze was overly sweet.  I should've known from the dinner rolls, which tasted store-bought, reminding me of my other restaurant golden rule: \" restaurant will only be as good as the bread they serve.\"  At least it reminds me that I have these rules for a reason.  This is undoubtedly the same kitchen that turns out room service orders for the Sheraton which recently served me a hockey puck for a burger.  Skip District, even if your ordering in.",

I can't even understand the bad reviews, but I'm guessing they come from people who are either uptight or just don't know good food when it hits them in the face. This place is incredible! We were lured in by the breakfast menu (green chili pork on fry bread for example) and we were pleasantly surprised by the gorgeous dining room and patio upon arrival. The service couldn't have been nicer or more attentive. And the food!! The chef's were spot on with every dish, from Californian benedict with crab cakes as the meat to simple buttermilk pancakes (which were soo good, they could hardly be called simple). Every dish tasted like it came from a 4 Michelin star kitchen!! Incredible. We were also told about their weekend bloody mary bar, Happy Hour every day from 3-5 and 10-Midnight, and that they will be soon changing their menu for fall. We will be back as often as we can get to District! Phoenicians: don't miss out on this gem that has been a well kept secret for too long!",

Three dollars for a pretty good selection of draft beers is almost unbeatable.  They also had several appetizers for 3 to 5 bucks.  The mac and cheese my friend had looked really scrumptious.  My other friend and I shared some Tots, which were crisp, and some chips with two dipping sauces.  The sauces were so so.  Hungry for a little more, I asked the waitress if I should get the Pork Sliders or the Wings.  She said to definitely go with the Sliders and so I took her advice.  Two mediocre sliders later, I was wishing I hadn't had so much bread and so little pork.  To make matters worse, I saw wings delivered to another table.  They looked plump and juicy and coated in a delicious sauce.  I was super disappointed.  I would go back, but don't trust that everything on the menu will be great.",

Make a reservation, arrive a few minutes early then simply enjoy an uncomplicated metropolitan dining experience in a spacious dining room with a wall of windows to the street and also a patio to dine outside.

We enjoyed the lobster pie, filet mignon and barbeque chicken and would order them again.   Our server was knowledgeable about the menu offerings, attentive and friendly, great service, food and a relaxing dining experience.

Granted there were not a lot of people here on this particular night, but what can you expect for 11:00pm on a Tuesday?  Anyways, with a lounge band playing in the background, our friendly server handed us the late-night food menu and took our drink order.  For those of you that have issues making up your mind on what you want to drink, the district offers up both wine and beer flights.  I of course got the beer flight and enjoyed my 3 different beers.  And these are not weenie-sized glasses of sampler beer.  You get quite the pour.  My sister got the wine flight, and the portion sizes were huge!  The late night food menu did not disappoint either.  Sweet potato tater tots were to die for, and the cheese plate was full of variety.  Someday I'll check this place out for an actual dinner, and I know for sure that for a late night food/beer stop in downtown Phoenix, I'll be back here in a heartbeat.",

The second round we had beer because at least you know what you are getting with those. The food was okay - pretzel bite fondue was delicious but the baked mac and cheese was runny and tasted like Kraft mac and cheese. The waitress was super slow and hardly paid attention to us. She required us to put a credit card down to have the tab open, but went on break when we wanted to leave and took our credit card with her! The manager had to go find her on her break in order to get our card. From the time we said we wanted the check to the time we were actually leaving it took an hour. The manager waived 50% of one of our bills for the inconvenience, but all four of us were inconvenienced! And gee, thanks for the $7 off one bill. So generous seeing as your employee went AWOL with our credit card.",

    "text": "Some chicas and I were heading down to Phoenix to see a play on a Friday night, and needed a place close by the theater for some food and drinks prior (it is a play!)  I found District online and it looked promising and right across from the Herberger.  It is situated in the bottom of the Sheraton hotel, but is very large for a hotel bar/restaurant.  Online I learned they had a good looking happy hour with comfort type food and reasonable drinks - score!  They had a nice patio, so we asked the hostess if we could sit outside for happy hour, but she informed us we could not, only for dinner.  Hmmm, ok?  She said we could sit in the bar, but the bar was packed, not a seat to be had.  My friends and I joked that we could sit what looked like a rolling banquet cart - and try to find chairs.  I went to the bar to atleast get some cocktails while we hovered for a table.  I ordered 3 of the White Peach Sangria's, which were on happy hour for $3.75.  As great as they sound, they were not good.  It tasted like they had dumped the whole \"can\" of cling peaches in the drink, because all I could taste was syrup.  We found a table and proceeded to order some food.  We shared the All American Cheeseburger, a huge burger a la carte, for only $6, the Sloppy Joe Sliders, 3 small sliders for $5 (manwich?.)  The Spiced Sweet Potato Fries, which were great at $3 and came in a little brown bag with a moroccan type yogurt sauce for dipping, and the Mac N Cheez with Beer Hots.  I loved the Mac N Cheez, but my friend wasn't crazy about the hot dogs in it.  The burger was by far the best deal, a huge burger and only $1 more than the 3 tiny little sloppy joe sliders.  We then ordered a round of Vodka/Sodas, and they didn't dissapoint.  Our total tab for 3 was around $46 before tip, so a pretty good deal.  DO get the burger and the sweet potato fries, but get a beer or a mixed drink instead of the white peach sangria.",

Don't get me wrong.  The desserts are exactly as described on the menu however, after a wonderful meal, i was expecting something better.  Somehow, (we didn't  complain, it just got out), when we got back to our rooms, the restaurant manager called to express his regrets that we didn't enjoy our desserts so he took it off our bill.  Is that impressive, or what?  A manager that actually cares!  I am spreading the news of this hotel and fabulous restaurant.  We ate for a change of pace at some restaurant across the street at the Arizona Center, called \"1030\".  Boy, was that a mistake.  It just doesn't compare to the District.  Same price, but not nearly the same quality of food.  After four nights at the hotel, we ate at the District four times.  We loved the Cobb Salad, the Salmon on the plank, the ribs cooked or marinated for 72 hours were out of this world, served with Jalapeno grits (or polenta, I forget) , my husband liked his vegetarian pumpkin curry, the very spicy fried chicken, the crab cakes were moist, not dry. I heard the huge Chicken Pot Pie was excellent but I didn't get the chance to try it.  To me, this is the ONLY place to eat in downtown Phoenix. One more tip, go on Sundays when the wines are half off.",

The only thing we would have changed was that the sloppy joe came with tator tots. And looking at the menu, they list sweet potato tots as a side. So naturally we assumed they tots would be the same but they weren't. They were just regular old tots, nothing special.  Would definitely go back for lunch again. Also, the hotel decor, bar, lobby and lounge were stylish and seemed to have the potential for a good downtown hotspot if marketed correctly.",

This meal was outstanding. The two young men that served were excellent.  After dinner I moved to the bar where I thought the guy and gal behind the bar was cold as ice, too busy with themselves to speak with patrons. I decided to cut the visit at the bar short. A couple days later I read about the anniversary couple being treated poorly and I could relate. This event probably had everything to do with a few employees that have poor work ethics and not much else. Also notable the gals at the front door were top top.  Over all I liked the place and the one visit was good for me.",

We were seated off to the side, out of view from almost the entire restaurant. This was what I believe the problem was for us. It took roughly 30 minutes to get our first round of drinks, and most of the service was pretty slow that evening. However, the Manager did come over and apologize and gave us our first round of drinks on him. I ordered the Cedar Roasted Pacific Salmon with asparagus tip risotto, and it was great. This is definitely a great place to visit if you find yourself downtown for any reason. I do not think I would come downtown specifically to eat here, but it was still a great meal.",

I mean my mouth had the memory, really. The texture was perfect. It was thick but moist -not dense. Juicy, and despite a giant bun, the bread was soft and not overpowering.   WHERE did I have that fantastic burger?   First frustration: I know it's not the burger I'm having tonight!   WHERE was I when I had that burger? I called Dottsy Z. because I vaguely remembered her being present for the experience... with her help, I remembered it was the burger I split with Don S. (a.k.a. Donjay) at District!   MAN! THAT was a good burger!  Now, I'm a little less looking forward to the burger I'm having tonight. Although a value, it will not be as good.  I'm grateful for the memory and can assure you the next time someone asks, \"where can I get a great burger downtown?\" I'll remember!   I recommend adding green chile... :)  Quite possibly my favorite \"downtown\" downtown happy hour: the pretzel fondue is a steal, as are the well drinks!",

    "text": "Today my folks and I enjoyed the best Mother's Day brunch at District. We usually avoid restaurants on Mother's Day, but decided to take a chance on District after seeing the incredible buffet brunch menu listed with bottomless mimosas for only $34.   We had been here once before during a food tour, and really liked what we were able to try for the dessert course. We even stayed to enjoy the house jazz band that night.  The place has a great atmosphere and the desserts we tried (especially the whoopie pies) were outstanding. I also loved learning that they source a lot of their ingredients from their rooftop garden, as well.   The staff is extremely friendly, and considering this restaurant is part of a hotel, it goes way beyond your typical hotel fair. The brunch today had:  * Roasted Pork Loin w/Honey Bourbon Glaze * Pesto Crusted Salmon * Rooftop Herb Garden Marinated Chicken * NY Smoked Cheddar & Chive Risotto * Burgundy Braised Short Ribs  Not to mention, they had an omelette station, delicious sausages, salads, french toast, maple glazed bacon and dessert display that rivals any I've seen. They truly have a noteworthy pastry chef who dazzled with creations like butterscotch parfaits, salted caramel macadamia nut whoopie pies, and sour cherry nut clusters. It was extremely impressive.  They also had a great bloody mary bar that served as our first round of cocktails, and we sat outside in perfect weather, without any chaos and the lovely company of a great server.   Granted, I have only been here for dessert and a specialty brunch, but I must say, the experiences so far have been wonderful and from what I've seen of the regular menu, I'm sure my folks and I will be back for dinner next time I'm in town to visit.   If anything, stop in here for a night cap and a delectable dessert!",

    "text": "My wife and I went here for our anniversary dinner, which happened to also be during restaurant week. When I was looking for places to go, I looked at the special menu for restaurant week and it looked incredible. When we got there we were greeted and sat promptly. The place was busy, which makes the time it took for the server to come and  greet us understandable. The service was good for how busy it was.   Now on to the food. Again, the food on the restaurant week menu sounded good, but the execution on the flavors was lacking. We had the salad, which was quite good, and we had the dates wrapped in bacon. These were good, but the bacon was limp and it seemed liked they just threw the items on the plate.   On to the second course, we had the short ribs and scallops. The scallops were amazing and perfectly cooked. The short rib tasted like a basic pot roast and really didn't have much flavor and the gnocchi were gritty and over cooked.   The third course was excellent. We tried both items - the white chocolate blue berry creme brulee and the salted caramel oreo bar. The espresso ice cream on the oreo bar was outstanding and the lemon snicker doodle on the creme brulee were amazing.   After we finished as much as we could of the desert, we were brought out a surprise anniversary cake, which we had to take home as were too full. The cake was moist and flavorful when we ate it the next day. When all is said and done, they brought out some cotton candy.   This seems like an overload on sugar and I am confused as to why they would bring out the cotton candy if we already had dessert.   All in all, it was an okay experience.",

Beautiful decorations made by the Pastry Chef chef looked real: a dress, purses, ruby slippers & more all made of chocolate & other flavors of fondant.  The selection of food was, at first,  overwhelming until I walked around around to see what was where. The ribs were superb, as we're the potatoes, eggs, roast, selection of fruits & cheeses. Service was great EXCEPT FOR the minutes when our server had to leave to get something for another table &, at the back of the room stood the restaurant manager 2 other servers talking & ignoring the other tables. I know that being a server is hard work & support breaks, etc. I also understand being assigned tables/sections. However, in this type of event, if a server is away to get drinks, etc for for table, the manager especially should be ensuring other servers are assisting with simple water & coffee refills, not ignoring patrons while conversing with the servers. Not at the price of this event. My ONLY real \"complaint\", for lack of a better word, is that I wish the website photo would say, \"The District American Kitchen & Wine Bar Inside of the Sheraton Hotel\".  In the Phoenix area are The District Nightclub in Scottsdale as well as the District in Tempe (apt building) & The District Property Investment in Phoenix, which DID cause confusion for some in our group unfamiliar with the area. I'd highly recommend this for Easter &/or Mother's Day Brunch & hope we go again. Pricey but worth it.  Valet parking with the hotel.",

    "text": "My hubby and I are both vegetarians and one of my pet peeves is going to a restaurant and having to order the same meal because there is only one vegetarian item on the menu (first world problems - I know).  Its kind of a bummer.  We checked out the District's menu online and the first awesome thing is that their vegetarian entre isn't the requisite portobello mushroom burger or eggplant something-or-other.  They totally score points for that.    Since we had plans to meet a coworker of mine there for dinner, I thought I'd give them a call to see if there were any other entre options for vegetarians.  This is where the superior service experience began.  I asked the woman who answered the phone if they had any additional vegetarian options for dinner.  She replied that she'd check with the chef and call me back - not at all what I expected.  Generally, the answer to that question is, \"Well, we have salads and stuff\".  When she called back she explained she had spoken to the chef and he'd be happy to specially prepare an additional vegetarian entree for us - a roasted vegetable tart.  Again, not at all the response I was expecting - I was more than pleasantly surprised.  She included a notation in the reservations about the special meal and we were all set.  So, a few nights later my husband and I met my coworker and had a lovely dinner at the District.  The service was excellent and the atmosphere was oh so classy.  We were able to enjoy different meals - each veggie entre was delicious and we were beyond happy with the service and the accommodations the District staff were willing to make.    Its a bit pricey but its a swanky place and considering the fabulous service we received I'd say its totally worth it.",

I've had a number of business meeting breakfasts here, but ONLY because the people I meet stay at the hotel. The food is average. I cannot think of anything better to say about it.

I have found in my recent travels that bartenders at hotel bars are really friendly, and District's did not disappoint tonight. All three that waited on us were extremely friendly and helpful. I also appreciated that if you valet, you can get your parking validated and get up to three hours for free. The valet was very quick and the gentlemen that helped me tonight were also very friendly...dare I say the friendliest valets I have encountered in the Valley even! There was live music tonight, but at times it was a bit too loud. However, any guy with a guitar that plays a ton of songs I like is OK in my book...plus I thought he was pretty good.  We sat at the bar tonight which was very enjoyable. The bottle of sauvignon blanc was crisp and quite delicious, especially after a long week of work. We ordered the Chesapeake Bay crab cakes and the chips and dip. Normally I do not like crab cakes that are crispy on the outside, but the coating was light and didn't detract from the crabmeat. While there was not as much crabmeat as I would have liked, what was in there was tasty and there was almost no filler! Woo hoo! I can't say they are identical to what you would find back in Maryland, they are not far off enough where I can hate on them. The chips and dip were a nice snack...in fact, I almost gasped when I saw how large the serving was of chips! The dill dip was really tasty and a nice compliment to the chips. For the bottle of wine, the crabcakes and the chips and dip, our bill came to $45.  I'm wavering between 3 and 4 stars, but will round down to 3 since there was nothing incredibly special or memorable about my experience. While the District menu does not have me running back, I can see this being a place to meet friends after work for drinks and appetizers or as a place where my coworkers and I run to for lunch when we need a drink or two to make it through the rest of the day!",

And their 1/2 off appetizer list is extensive from caesar salad to sloppy joes.  I ordered an actual entree off the menu.  The most amazing tofu steak I have ever had, by far.  I am not even a vegetarian.",

The bar area had a good amount of people so we seated ourselves at a high table off to the side. The server patiently waited for us to make our choices, brought them out not too long later and checked in every so often to make sure we were doing ok. He was nice enough to split up our tabs without us asking, but he charged me for my friend's 2 orders. No big deal though because I had cash so my friend was able to easily handle the rest of the bill.   All in all, it's a chill place for a Friday night, but the music isn't really our thang.",

My sister ordered the caesar with a side of shrimps which came steamed, and flavorless. the charge for them was $8 and I thought this was way overpriced for what she got.  I ordered the braised chicken. All the sides were swimming (drowning) in the jus. the flavored were good though.  Overall, a bit of a disappointment. the menu looks promising, the flavors are there, maybe the execution and final touches need to be adjusted. just my 2 cents.",

They serve you an interesting pickly relish of sorts with bread to start.  Then I went with the organic bbq pork tenderloin, mac and cheese, and apple sauce.  Was a very tasty dish.  They then serve you cotton candy afterwards.  It's kind of a homage to old western american cuisine.  They really strive to keep the food local with I'm fully behind.",

It was perfectly seasoned and had a surprising but not overwhelming kick from the habernero.    Our server was helpful, efficient, and friendly.  There was live music playing in their bar up front, and the ambience was perfect for catching up with a good friend.

    "text": "The Event:  Staff Party for work  -a.k.a.- the best people in the world getting together to share food, drinks, conversation, and secret santa gifts before people start using their vacation days for the holidays (8 people attending).  The Setting: District, in the Sheraton Hotel, Downtown Phoenix -a.k.a.- Very nice in the non-hotel bar/restaurant-y type of way (important).  High top tables for groups, regular height tables for smaller parties. Large, long, space. The tops of the high tops were incredibly tiny which wasn't so good when the food was ordered as all the food comes on these rather large (unnecessarily large for how small the actual food items are) wooden block platters and all of the bowls are unevenly shaped for visual affect (or just to screw with you, not sure...).  This just caused us to be clumsy when trying to maneuver dishes or hand the waitress any empty glasses...if any of us had gotten more than just lightheaded (the price of the drinks, even if I didn't have to pay for them deterred that) it would have been disastrous.    The Drinks:  Amazing, delicious peach sangria ($3.75 on happy hour...which lasts until only 6pm), great wine flights including a \"Bubbly Flight\" of two yummy champagnes (and one not so much); fruit flavored beers. -a.k.a.- It's not the cheapest spot ever, and it's not as if the drinks are amazingly intricate or overly delicious to make up for the price.  Not crazy expensive, but we certainly won't be making this place our usual happy hour spot.  The Food: \"Small Plates\" (first round: the golden calamari, the AZ Sweet Shrimp Po'Boy sliders, two orders of steamed mussels, the cheese plate, the house chips and dips, the sweet potato tater tots (mmmm!), the crabcakes.  second round (we were still hungry): another cheese plate and another order of the house chips and dip) Dessert (still hungry): raspberry cobbler (VERY TART!), The brownie fudge Sundae (very tiny), and the key lime pie (I'm not a fan of this pie in general, so I won't judge). -a.k.a.- I said it there (whispered to my friend next to me) and I'll say it now: Cheese plate = Charlie Brown's Thanksgiving.  Yep, there was actually popcorn on it.  Popcorn and Ritz Crackers...no lie.  It wouldn't be so bad if the popcorn and Ritz Crackers weren't the best thing on the plate (if not the best thing on the table).  The Tater Tots, however, were GOOD, and the house chips and dips were bearable (but only when dipped in the sauce that came with the tater tots).  The desserts were amateur...I like simple dishes, but I also like not feeling as if I could make something better than the chef.  Not a very wide selection, definitely not enough to call it tapas and make a meal (without ordering the same dish twice).  Also noticed that there were very few (very few) vegetarian options.  The Service:  Our server was very nice.  All the female servers wear these little short black skirts with an awkward (considering the setting and the placement of it) long slit up the front.  Not the most attentive, but not negligent. -a.k.a.-Less than I expect from a night out.  Overall: Probably won't be going back there, but wouldn't be overly pissed if someone suggested it...especially if they wanted to pay for my drinks and then go for a real (non-popcorn) dinner afterward.",

But we needed to change our theater night to Saturday during the NRA Convention, so we wanted to secure a downtown parking spot early. District offers 3 hour free valet parking.  The restaurant was not crowded when we arrived or left even tho downtown was packed. Lots of large groups here. It wasn't especially contemporary looking as I expected; more typical of a hotel restaurant. The waiter (Orlando) was cute and attentive to our 8pm theater time.  I ordered the Pseudo Stroganoff; a vegan dish made with seitan that was quite good. My theater pal had the pork tenderloin with mac/cheese and applesauce. The applesauce was more like apple syrup, but she raved about the tastiness of her meal too. We both agreed that we would definitely go back. The food was reasonably priced, well executed, and the service was as it should be.  ps no more sweet potato tots.  (Spell check says I have errors, so I apologize; but it doesn't offer alternatives.)",

Best: beer prices and good choices, some were only $3 and that is not on special. Buffalo wings were grilled and you got a ton, Meatloaf sliders were wonderful but you only got 2...boo,  worst: my cheeseburger sliders tasted like they were fishy...probably not a good sign, cashews should have just been free not on the bar menu for $5, and chips and dip are so so,   It was a nice place to check out, I would recommend eating in the restaurant though instead. It seemed like a better menu. Also I believe if you follow them on twitter and facebook they have secret specials...might be worth checking out also!",

    "text": "So after our amazing Mother's Day experience at District, we really hadn't gotten back since then.  Sure, we stopped by when they were having their $3 burger deal (which was amazing) but it didn't really seem to warrant an update to the review since it was another special.  This past weekend, we FINALLY got over for breakfast.  This place is always appealing because it is right across from the AMC and we usually hit up a movie early in the morning.  This morning, in particular, we were feeling a little adventurous so we decided to head over to District for their Breakfast Bar.  Now I'm a fan of breakfast buffets.  If we still had Shoney's here in PHX I would be there every weekend.  The opportunity for me to customize my plate to my exact specifications is never lost on me.  With District, they give you the most amazing ingredients to make your breakfast into a work of art.  A lot of the food was the same as our Mother's Day brunch.  It featured the creamiest eggs I've ever had, the tastiest Schreiner's Sausage, and some bomb French toast that I covered in the best Vermont maple syrup I'd ever had.  There was a litany of fruits, yogurts, and breads for me to try as well.  Really, this was simply the best breakfast buffet I'd ever had.  We are totally going back for dinner during AZ Restaurant Week to try some more.",

My thing was that the muddled drink needs a wider straw.. not a stir stick you find on board one of the airplanes I work on to stir your coffee and cream with.. and the waitress forgot about us a bit.. but I liked the ambience.. the dj was spinning pretty decent stuff and my muddled drink at 8.5 was pretty cool fixed with herbs from the garden atop..",

    "text": "District American Kitchen and Wine Bar, a very nicely decored restaurant on the main floor of the Sheraton Grand Phoenix Hotel, comes up a little short in some respects.  Lunch specials are from 12-3PM where anything on the center page of the menu is $9.  However, all items on the menu sides are normal priced.  For what you get, the $9 price is fair.  I've been here twice, both times for lunch.  The inside is very nice, bright with sunlight, and spacious.  Seating is comfortable and the staff is friendly.  The \"Golden\" Calamari (lightly battered in tapioca flour and fried) was excellent, though I didn't care for dipping it in the seasoned [gremolata] olive oil (who does that?) or the aioli sauce.  If the calamari was grilled, then the \"gremolata\" makes sense, not when it's fried and already has oil on it.  I'm no chef though, so I could be way off!  The calamari by itself was indeed very good.  The Po'Boy Shrimp Sandwich left much to be desired.  The shrimp, tomato, and coleslaw combo was tasty, but it needed more shrimp (i.e. substance) to make up for the thick bread.  If this sandwich was eaten after paying full price ($14), I would have been EXTREMELY disappointed.  The Cedar-Roasted Pacific Salmon and Risotto is good (all gluten-free), but again, it's lacking something--taste!!!  Normal price is $15.  The glazing on the salmon is very light.  The risotto had good texture but lacked that something extra to kick it up a notch on the old taste buds!*  Overall, all of it could be improved.  *NOTE: my taste buds are fully functional, if not over-functional. :-)  So my advice?  If you're downtown, then try District for lunch or dinner, but keep your expectations grounded.  Personally, the (hotel) bar looks awesome.  I'd much rather hang out there!",

    "text": "I had a great lunch here last Monday afternoon. I met two of my colleagues for a bite and we all really enjoyed our meals.   I had a delicious chopped salad topped with salmon. I asked for the salmon to be cooked as rare as possible and they delivered. Lots of fresh greens, quinoa, fruit and nuts; lovely presentation and great quality.  One of my colleagues had a grilled cheese with bacon and fries; the fries were awesome. (I greedily grabbed several....)  Service was beyond fabulous - loved the guy that took care of us (wish I had paid attention to his name). Perfect timing with everything...not overbearing and super friendly.  Was hoping to get back there for another meal at some point but was stuck at the convention center most of the week.  Good stuff.",

If you haven't then head on over to the District American Kitchen and Wine Bar and expeirence it for yourself.  The District American Kitchen and Wine Bar is so amazing that I actually went two nights in a row. The staff at the District are great and the food is amazing.  I especially enjoyed the Brisket Tacos, Sloppy Joe Sliders , and Macaroni and Cheese.  In addition, to amazing food the District has a great selection of local craft beers.  In fact, I ended up buying and refilling a growler.    The restaurant is spacious, clean,  trendy and has a large bar area to relax and unwind. Just when I thought my dining experience couldn't get any better.  Megan gave us  free cotton candy (grape) after our meal. I honestly couldn't remember the last time I had cotton candy.   Meagan, Jeff, and Noah - You're the best! This was a superb dining experience, Thank You.",

The slow service is why I give it three stars. It was a Wednesday night and we weren't asked for drink refills until halfway through our meal - they had been empty since the appetizers. Overall it was okay. A diverse menu that suited our group.",

Our party of 5 enjoyed a good dinner, nothing out of the box or overly amazing, just solid. The trout I enjoyed (though it looked, smelled, and tasted like salmon) and the short ribs were good too. A little on the salty side, but not so very bad. The desserts tasted as if they had been sitting a little too long in the walk-in frig waiting for patrons that evening. They were out of a few of the beers on their beverage list, and the place was not overly crowded. You could probably stop in and grab yourself a table if you're so inclined.",

The hostesses were friendly and inviting. Our server Gary was the best, even if he is a Cowboys fan (go Steelers!) I tried the #Embers cocktail with vodka instead of gin and it was very refreshing. The fresh lavender garnish was pretty. We had the calamari appetizer and it was delicious. It was served with a lemon aioli and a pistachio gremolata. Together the combination was unique and full of flavor. Best calamari I've had in a long time. We shared the mac and cheese and the short rib sloppy Joe. Both were yummy. Overall this place was a winner. Another plus: they take open table reservations.",

I had an over priced \"Greens, Grain, & Goat\" salad with a small slice of \"$6 add chicken\". NOT IMPRESSED! The \"Green\" was brown iceberg lettuce. The \"Grain\" barely existed. And finally the \"Goat\", which was good. Not worth $14. And don't get me started on the $6 2 ounce chicken that was added. It tasted good, but small. Not worth $6.  The restaurant isn't busy, and it's still an hour before they close. I finished my meal about 15 min ago. At least the service was decent.

They have a variety of $5 drinks as well as several appetizers that are half off. I tried the white peach sangria, which was deliciously fruity but a tad too sweet.   We were craving some late night dessert, so we got the pumpkin creme brulee and the peanut butter chocolate cake - they were both decent but not quite what we expected. The creme brulee basically tasted like pumpkin pie filling, which isn't bad but just isn't creme brulee. The chocolate cake was layered with lots of peanut butter mousse (and something that tasted like Reese's Pieces?), which was almost a bit much for even an avid peanut butter-lover like myself.  I did really like the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant, and the bartenders were very friendly. I'd consider coming back to try the lunch or dinner entrees!",

The first is when we are attending a performance at the Herberger Theater, and we need a good place to grab a bite afterwards.  The other is when it's First Friday in downtown Phoenix, and we eat here before we do our Art Gallery tours.  I don't really have any restaurants in the Arizona Center that I am particular fond of, and the others that are within walking distance have varying levels of food quality and service.  The food is more than adequate, not particularly spectacular, but it is the service and atmosphere that draws us to this place. We like how spacious it is, and the semi-elegant look that is in keeping with the Sheraton Hotel's motif is particularly enticing.  The Calamari and the Hummus are great for starters. It doesn't take them long to deliver these, so if you're famished; I would suggest you open up with these appetizers.  For the Main Entrees, the Salmon and Herb Roasted Chicken have been consistently flavorful. And if you are in the mood for a steak, I would recommend ordering the Big Sky Ribeye, as it is quite appetizing.  Again, on a scale from 1-10, the food here is a 6.5-7.5. But, with the dearth of other better options, The District is not a bad alternative.   There is the 1130 restaurant in the Arizona Center, but so far; that place hasn't quite delivered as far as we're concerned.",

Super convenient location to my hotel room (15 stories up).  But it just didn't make the cut.  Number one : why go here when there is a perfectly good bar in the lobby of the Sheraton, offering the same limited bar selections and the same \"Bar\" menu (only the prices are lower in the lobby).    Number two : (the loneliest number) if you're missing additional members of your party, you're likely to get lost in the shuffle.  I made two attempts and was forgotten (ignored for larger parties/tips?) both times.  Number three : their happy hour starts at 3 - 7pm on weekdays.  You may choose from a very limited number of appetizers (essentially, the unappetizing ones), but at least cocktails are AROUND $5 (you can find cheaper/better further downtown).  Prices are pretty stiff, the usual for hotel restaurants.  An 8oz \"bowl\" of soup will run you about $7.  An appetizer of pretzel bites, $14.  Only vegetarian entree of white beans and greens, $22 (what?!).  Number four : the only cider they have tasted like the smell of dirty mops (though, it may have been the glass....which still isn't promising).  Number five : .......the hair that broke the camel's back.  ....O yeah.  Needing something sweet to brighten my bleary evening, I splurged on the Huckleberry Bread Pudding Sundae  (with horchata ice cream, candied pecan *singular*, caramel drizzle, and sweet creep dollop $6).  It was actually pretty good.  It was brightening my blustery blues.....until I saw the very-not-mine hair emerging from the slice of pie.  The cost of this was waved from my tab (as it should have been), but the experience was terribly off-putting.  I don't anticipate being in the area any time soon - but I'd encourage Sheraton-stayers to explore beyond the limits of the lobby...",

I loved the layout of the bar and all the glass windows.  We started off with the sea salt bread. It was a little too salty for my liking and I wished they had brought out butter. Then suddenly, for free, we got to try some little bruschettas. 3 each for each person. The olive one was way too olive-y for me, the tomato basil was fine, but the fig one was just right! I could eat many of those. We then had bacon-wrapped dates with maple syrup. If you're a sucker for sweet and salty like myself, you must try these. The sweetness was offset by the salty bacon, making for a very delicious appetizer. For my main course I had the spinach salad with strawberries, goat cheese, almonds and poppy seed vinaigrette. It was VERY tasty! I cleaned my very modern-looking plate/bowl. For dessert they give you free cotton candy! Not the first time I've seen this, but still, uncommon at least.   The drinks were a bit steep, but the staff was very friendly, professional and easy to talk to. Or server, Alexis, was funny and sweet.   Definitely will go back for lunch.",

    "text": "If you like mussels you have to hit up District's happy hour menu.  For $11 you will get a bucket of mussels that is seemingly endless (until you run out), a couple of pieces of garlic bread, and really good broth that's spicy enough to bite back just a little.  There has to be at least 20-25 mussels in that bucket.  It is one of the best deals going.  Happy hour will also get you $5 house reds and whites to go with it.  Ambiance is nice with good music, dim lights, and a bar of solid granite.  Now, about the bar--or I should say the barkeep.  The one thing I wasn't too thrilled about is how the bartenders seemed to be randomized.  I'm sure there's a written schedule somewhere but I have been coming to PHX on business and staying at the attached Sheraton (attached) quite a bit lately.  Rarely do I see the same bartender.  Every so often there's one that's there twice but for the most part, that's a wild card.  Customers like to build rapports and like a familiar face (Think \"Cheers\" theme) when they comes somewhere to relax after a long day at work.  Management--step away from the scheduling computer for a minute.  Hospitality and pure efficiency don't always make for the best combination.  Consistency brings the customers back.    Waitresses?  Chelsea is the bomb.  They have her going back and forth between the Sheraton lobby bar and District.  When she's your waitress it's a good day.  She's engaging, has a great smile, gets the order right quickly--AND she owes me a game of \"Words With Friends!\"   I have also had breakfast here.  The breakfast is fairly average.  The usual fare and because District is attached to the Downtown Phoenix Sheraton Hotel.  Overall, I would normally give this place a 3-Star rating but the mussels ... Man they are over the top.",

The hostess is really an air head, she is too excited to get off work and go party herself than actually sit anyone. After waiting to be sited for over 35 mins, in an almost empty restaurant it took the waitress another  30 mins to come to take the drinks order. After waiting for 45 mins for the drinks we left. This is located inside the Sheraton Hotel and the hotel was packed with business travelers and tourists but the service is so bad people walked out to find other restaurants next door. I will never go back here and will not recommend anyone.",

    "text": "I'm struggling between 2, 3, 4 stars...  we'll see when I'm done.  Really love downtown and truly support more destinations for food, drink and entertainment.   So the Sheraton opened about a year ago now.  I've been to a few meetings there, and also have stopped in to District for breakfast, lunch or dinner on several occasions on my way to something else downtown.   Positives: - Lovely architecture and wonderful art, mostly from local Arizona artists which is a huge plus.   (Hint:  you can ask the concierge in the lobby for their guidebook to the art; it's not perfect but it's an interesting book.)  - Very cordial, professional service. - All the food I ate at District was expertly prepared & presented - Everything I tried was delicious.  Negatives: - There is nothing terribly exciting or inventive about the food on the District menu.  - The biggest negative is the price - whoo-eee.   We're talking big city (\"they gotta eat here because they're staying here\")  exhorbitant hotel restaurant prices.   I tried Sunday brunch today... just had a simple bowl of oatmeal, which came with - oddly - slivered almonds and candied orange rind cubes - which were actually quite tasty in the oatmeal.   A side of potatoes - rosemary red new potatoes, grilled.   Yum there too.   A pot of hot tea, and then a glass of fresh squeezed OJ.   How much do you think my total bill would be?   I was a little taken aback by the prices - I've attached photo of the breakfast menu for your review.   I got out of there for around $25 - yikes!   They have a breakfast buffet which actually looks amazing - huge!   That's $15.95 and I thought it would be too much food - but if I had the ability to control myself I probably would have saved money by going that way with the brunch.  Okay overall - it's A-Ok, 3 stars.   Too pricey for regular visits for me, but the type of place you can take your out of town guests to make sure they have a good meal, no penny pinching allowed!",

Last time we went, we all ordered the mac and cheese, the pretzel bites, and Kobe beef sliders. The mac and cheese and pretzel were items we had enjoyed munching on in the past while having some beers, so we were sorely disappointed with what eventually came out.   The mac and cheese had a familiar taste and it didn't take long for us to figure it out: Hamburger helper with cheese puffs. Listen, I'm not hating on hamburger helper but it's not exactly what I want when I go to an \"upscale\" bar for happy hour. The pretzel bites which were once warm, soft, and chewy chunks of pretzels were replaced by thinly sliced, toasted pieces of pretzel. Think brushcetta only with pretzels. Neither soft nor crunchy, it just lacked any textural identity, which made it all the more disappointing. Oh and the sliders...they looked like two average sliders for $10.   Honestly it felt like the chef decided to get a little cutesy with the menu. I'm not against presentation but when it's paired with mediocre food and shrinking portions, it looks all the more ridiculous.",

Our server, William, was very knowledgeable, friendly, and uber professional. (Are we still using uber? If not, you get what I mean...)   We enjoyed the calamari as a starter and my son had the crab cakes while I enjoyed the evening's special shrimp with Mediterranean rigatoni. The calamari was a little chewy but the crunch was quite nice. It came with a chimichurri sauce as well as a spiced mayo dip. The chimichurri was nice but the mayo dip could have used more kick. Our main dishes were great though. My son loved his crab cakes. They were just the right combination of moist yet flaky too. The house-made tartar sauce was fresh and quite tasty.  The special shrimp with rigatoni was terrific. It had wonderful chantrelle mushrooms in it that were meaty and delicious. The Mediterranean sauce was nice without being overly briny from the kalamata olives. The sourdough bread was nice and the olive oil dipping sauce was just right as well.  When the check came, a serving of cotton candy came with it which was a sweet touch.   All in all, it was a very nice evening and reasonably priced for a downtown hotel location. We will definitely give it another try!",

Not thrilled: Po' Boy Shrimp sandwich is overwrought with the taste of onion.  Cheesy Corn Dogs I think might have been better without the cheese oddly enough.  Green Chilie Stew was amazingly salty.  Enh: Baked Onion Soup - could have been better if it weren't $8 for 6oz.  Good selection of beer on tap.    More than likely I will be back, my family really dig the burger.  I still have a desire to try so many other things but I'm night acquiesce and just stick with the burger.  And tater tots.",

The only thing is that the fries were horribly oversalted!! UGH.  I couldn't even finish them!  My one coworker who eats here all the time said that the fries are always WAY to salty and is unsure of who to talk to about it.  Being that I dont eat here often, Im not sure either..plus, since Im not a regular, I dont want to go in there and be like \"hey your fries are ALL ENTIRELY salt\" and then leave....blah. Anyways...

We went in time for their happy hour (which ends a 7pm) and sat at one of the bar tables. Very cool ambiance. We had a great server who made helpful suggestions and guided us through the array of menu options. I tried their red wine sangria ($5) - it was a beautiful magenta color and was one of the better sangrias I'd had in a long time. I also had their Pineapple Lavender cocktail (not on happy hour - $10) which is very tart and lemon-y. Not for everyone, but I loved it! They hand-make their drinks with fresh fruit (so they take a little while) and use fresh herbs grown on their rooftop garden.   My boyfriend picked the food and we indulged! All the appetizers were $4 (except for the nachos which were $5). The pretzel bite fondue included three pretzels definitely larger than a bite, maybe 3 or 4 bite-size. The cheese was warm and melty. Good dish.   We also had the macaroni & cheese w/ Schreiner's beer hots. I think this one was our least favorite of all the dishes we ordered. Not that it was bad, it just didn't stand out. A take on mac & cheese with cut up hotdog.  The nachos were topped with all the good stuff you'd expect to find on nachos: gooey cheese, pico de gallo, guac, sour cream, and steak. The chips were a little thicker, so they didn't break and get soggy.   Finally, we had the buffalo sloppy joe sliders. Great flavor, would definitely get these again.   I'm not in downtown Phoenix very often, but District will definitely be at the top of my list next time I attend an event in the area.",

Great service with a live dj playing lively music to go along with some awesome drink deals. The ladies had an awesome chocolate martini and us men had a some great locally brewed IPA tap beers.

    "text": "After reading Georgie's review I was quite excited to try District. I went there last week and sat at the bar to indulge in their happy hour prices. THEY HAVE SANGRIA ON HAPPY HOUR! Now big props, it wasn't the best sangria (a little sweet for my tastes) but for Under 5 bucks I'm sold! This is the only place in the valley that I know of that includes this delicious beverage on happy hour.  For food we sampled: + shrimp po boy sliders - Awesome contained slaw and yummy sausage - cheeseburger sliders - Way to greasy wouldn't order again + boneless chicken wings (they had a fancy name that I can't remember) decent - sweet potatoe tots - too greasy and served with a chutney that didn't really compliment the tots  Now granted this was just the lounge menu. In looking at the full dinner menu there are quite a few dishes (mac n cheese, pot pies) that I will have to come back to try (and hopefully bump this review up a star). The staff was excellent, very friendly and the wide variety of people made for some interesting people watching.",

The flavor was good but it was just overkill on the cream and not enough chowdery substance.  Sand was a grilled chicken salad.  The just forgot to put it on one half of mine.  Also the bread was dense and dry.  Salad was a mixed greens with dried fruit, nuts and bleu cheese - but I am not sure if there was actually supposed to be cheese since I only had one little, I mean tiny, crumble.  Service was good - I expected so much more from the food.  Won't be going back anytime soon and it's right across the street...",

    "text": "We came downtown for the last night of Restaurant Week. We arrived early as we realized we might miss the lunar eclipse! We were seated at a very nice window table by a young staff with great attitude!  Ryan was our waiter and he did an excellent job, making suggestions from the special menu, pacing the courses and checking back with us in an unobtrusive manner. My husband and daughter ordered the street corn chowder. It was rich, maybe a little too heavy before a big meal, but very tasty. I ordered the duck quesadilla. It was creamy with goat cheese and little bits of meat. It came with a fig-chipotle jam that was odd initially, but  grew on me as I ate it!  My husband and I ordered the ordered the beef short rib. It was a pretty presentation with corn and peas. The corn was a little chewy, but the meat and seasonings were tender and delicious. We both had enough to take some home.  My daughter ordered the fried chicken. She loved the meat and mashed potatoes, but not so much the chorizo gravy. The restaurant had a nice policy where we were able to order any wine, and were just charged the difference in cost from the special menu pricing.  Here's the best part: Ryan checked with his manager and got us permission to go up to the 4th floor pool bar with our coffee, and put our dessert on hold so we could watch the eclipse! Perfect view!  We came back down and ate our pretty blueberry creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake at the bar with coffee refills! The lemon snicker doodle side was really the best!  Overall, a very nice evening!  Glad to have found a solid downtown restaurant!",

    "text": "Great restaurant and bar! We visited while staying at the Sheraton Grand Hotel. We walked down to the bar to watch a game and grab some drinks and appetizers. The atmosphere at the bar is very fun and casual, but I can see how the dining area in the restaurant could also be a great spot for a date!   The wait staff was very friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered drinks and appetizers from the bar and our food came or promptly. For appetizers we got the pretzel fondue and the popcorn shrimp which were both delicious. The popcorn shrimp actually had legit popcorn in it - which I thought was pretty clever.  For my meal I had the Caesar salad and my mom had the chopped salad and they were both delicious as well. Very fresh and tasteful! (Update: Jeffrey was our bartender!)  My mom also ordered a margarita and she says it was the best one she has had since visiting Arizona. The other restaurants have been not been to her liking and she usually really likes the taste. It was freshly made and squeezed right in front of us!   The customer service was great, our food was quick and tasty, the atmosphere was the perfect amount of fun and casual at the bar. We enjoyed our meal and we will be back!  For dessert I also got the bro-okie. Picture this: a hot brownie right out of then oven cooked took perfection with a warm cookie in the middle, topped with vanilla ice cream. Perfection. That is all.   Also pictured is the red velvet cake which was amazingly delicious as well. I just can't get over the Brookie. Definitely my kind of dessert.",

The chefs trio for lunch is unbeatable for the downtown area and the desserts are so gorgeous you don't want to eat them.   Happy hour drinks and specials are also fantastic here and change frequently. I had a fig Moscow mule around Xmas time and my friend had a mushroom manhattan that was out of this world. It's absolutely a must-try if you're in the area. Although service can be slow, this is because many people come here for leisurely business lunches and I think they don't want you to feel rushed.  If you just let your server know you're in a hurry, they are happy to get you in and out quickly.   I come here at least twice a month and have yet to be disappointed.",

In no time I was greeted by the waitress and asked for the most popular appetizer. Since I couldn't decide, I was happy to order the suggested District Mac N' Cheese - beer hots sausage, Cheez-It crumbs, NY white cheddar and smoked Gouda cheese sauce all in a mini flat iron pan/dish.  Such a comforting cheesy taste if you love Mac n cheese. The sausages have a bit of spice. Just enough to even out with the cheese. Dangerous, but also delicious!   Service was spot on!

Very eat to cut, utterly wonderful and tender meat. The taste was great without added sauces, which is a key to me. Asparagus was tasty as well and the potatoes were okay.   My friend had the beef tenderloin and after trying one bite, I have to say, the reduction was awesome and it was assuredly tender.    I read that they gave you a cotton candy after and I was looking forward to it. Our neighboring table received one as did several others, but we did not. It wasn't offered at all. I also ordered iced tea and while I got it, it was never refilled. Those two things knocked a star off for me.

Starting with a fresh wedge of butter lettuce and a delicious vinaigrette served on the side so that you could adjust the amount to your taste. This was served with a crunchy corn/ red bell pepper and couscous mixture.  The salmon that I had was divine with its lovely maple glaze and my husband's pork was prepared perfectly with a spicy rub. Being the dessert aholic that I am I am perfectly situated to pronounce the chocolate raspberry dessert to be one of the best I've ever had. Alexis , our server ,timed every course perfectly and was the epitome of what a server should be.",

Other good (but less successful) items include the Caesar salad (at $9, I'd like to at least see something more interesting, such as grilled romaine or topped with a sardine), triple chocolate whoopie pies for dessert (good, but seemed like something you could find at AJ's), and the many cocktails we drank, which were perfectly fine but not home-runs.  The service was good as well.  And on the bottom rung of all restaurant food I've ever eaten, there is the lowly short rib stroganoff.  This imitation Lean Cuisine microwave meal should never be served again.  I know that I'll return at some point - I bet that the drumsticks go great with a happy hour drink.  And the scallops really were delicious.",

If you love butterscotch and love yourself, just order it!  It's honestly the best I've ever had. But brace yourself: it should be served with a side of insulin. The dessert was HUGE! My husband and I spilt it, but it really should have been split 3 (or 4) ways. I just wasn't expecting such a large dessert since the lunch portions were small.",

    "text": "I stay at the attached hotel very often so I am going to break down District into it's different elements. I rate this as 5 stars when compared to other hotel restaurants not compared to every restaurant.  Food:  --Overall: The food is new age American food but luckily it does not suffer the usual downfall of being over-thought. There are multiple elements to each dish but they generally work in harmony and don't overpower each other.  --Breakfast: The breakfast here is fantastic. Everything is cooked well, and not overly complicated. Most importantly they make sure their bacon is crispy, none of that limp bacon you get at some places. Its always nice when they have the buffet (based on hotel capacity as I understand) because it gives you a bit more choice and selection.  I only wish they used their filtered water for the coffee, because you can really taste the saltiness of Phoenix tap water in the coffee and it ruins otherwise good coffee.  --Lunch: Only had lunch here a few times, decent chicken salad,  but the awesome tater tots will turn you into Napoleon Dynamite.  --Dinner: The dinner menu really shines here. The appetizers are all very good, but the street corn soup is a MUST have. Every entree is $22 (at least with their current deal) The steaks are cooked with skill, the salmon is nice an light. I would recommend anything on the dinner menu with the exception of the chicken and biscuits which I felt were rather heavy and too deconstructed.  Service:  The waiters and waitresses are all very friendly and know the menu well. They maybe talk about the concept of the restaurant and dishes a bit too much but it's not that imposing   Bar: After being stuck in meetings all day, the sanctuary of your hotel room feels a bit claustrophobic. Instead of watching tv or reading in my room I prefer to go down to the hotel bar and have a drink or two, read, and chat with other out of townees. The bar at district is perfect for that, however it has been rather empty most of the time I have been there, so I can bring a book and enjoy some good drinks. My only complaint would be the DJ they bring in sometimes, at least when I am there the DJ is playing way too loud for the setting. When there are 15 people in the bar sitting around you should not be playing EDM, at the very least play some background trance and turn your volume down a bit.  Ambiance: The ambiance of the restaurant is very modern and spacious, feels a little cold because it is so wide open, but it's not off putting.  Overall: If you are staying in downtown phoenix it is probably the best restaurant among the high rises.",

    "text": "Umm, made from scratch Sloppy Joes and fancy Mac and Cheese?? Pshh, you had me at Sloppy baby...  The fact that there are any sub-par reviews of this place shocks the hell out of me. I had my third meal at District last night, and just like my previous two, it was spectacular.  In the business of full disclosure, my friend and I were going to try Moira for the first time, but alas it was closed, and obviously a sign because we stumbled a few blocks further south to District and had quite the satisfying meal.  We walked in about 6:45, and I'm sad to report the place was empty.  We took a seat at a cocktail table in the bar area so I could watch the hockey game (seriously, I am a dream date) and perused the bar menu. A nicely mannered waitress approached us almost immediately and remained attentive and helpful throughout our entire meal.  The coolest thing about the bar menu was their new take on the pairing menu.  No longer do you have to be a wine conosseur to enjoy the Chef's special menu.  District offers three separate 3 course tasting menus, one featuring a wine pairing, one featuring a cocktail pairing, and one featuring a beer pairing all for between $12 and $14!  I mean, how cool is that?  I challenge you to find a better bargain for such high-quality fare complete with booze...give it up, you can't, I've looked.  If you don't know already, District offers about 10 or 12 different Microbrews on tap an obvious plus for a beer drinker like myself.  Being the difficult diner that I am, I asked for the Sloppy Joe Sliders off the beer pairing menu so I could get a couple other small things and try a bunch.  Yes, I am an adult, and no, I can't not order a Sloppy Joe when it is featured on a menu, I'm sorry, I just can't.  And thank goodness I lack that sense of propriety because the Sloppy Joe Sliders were freaking fantastic!! 3 perfectly sized mini toasted buns filled with possibly the best, spiciest Sloppy Joes I have ever eaten. Seriously, I sucked down my Apricot Ale seemingly in seconds thanks to the District's take on this classic!  Just don't tell my Mom, she still convinced I'm quite fond of her Mamwich Joes...  I also had to get a side of their Andouille infused Macaroni and Cheese, another embarrassing thing that I just can't not order if it's offered on a menu, and it did not disappoint.  Cheezy, creamy, gooey perfection. My only complaint is that I was so full from my Joes I barely made a dent in my Mac n Cheese...alas, there's always next time.  My dining companion ordered what must have been the biggest freaking burger I have ever seen, but to be honest I did not really look or care because I was far too enamored with my meal to be distracted by anything else.  All in all, I had a spectacular meal at the District, from beginning to end.  If you haven't checked out this gem at the new Downtown Sheraton, do yourself a favor, you'll be in for a treat.",

    "text": "This was really 3.5 stars and I'm rounding down to 3 for a few reasons...on which I will now elaborate.  District could be in any Sheraton, anywhere.  In fact, it is strikingly similar to Rum Fire, the trendy restaurant in the Sheraton Waikiki where I stayed for a few days this summer before my family arrived and we stayed moved to the family place.  The flooring, the red circular lounge area, the live music on Thursday nights...it was all the same.  Heck, even the menu was the same.  The difference was that in Waikiki there was a \"Hawaiian\" slant to everything and the live music was much, much better.  (And of course the beach front setting).  I get the impression that they are trying to market themselves as a \"downtown restaurant\" more than the \"place in the Sheraton\"...but to be honest, it is your quintessential trendy hotel restaurant.  The bartenders were really friendly.  The wine list for a \"wine bar\" is incredibly lacking.  Nothing interesting, nothing fun.  The pricing is on par with what I would expect from a hotel.  The space is modern and trendy, something that there isn't that much of in downtown.  I love the charm of a historic home, but I also love sleek and modern lines.  We selected a few small plates, or appetizers, depending on which of their menus you are looking at.  The crab cakes were good, if nothing short of predictable, and the chips and dip were surprisingly unique.  A dill dip and a French onion dip provided a nice departure from the regular spinach artichoke.  I'm not sure this is a place that I would come to for dinner, and it is definitely not a place I would come to for brunch.  (The brunch menu is a typical hotel menu, with typical hotel pricing).  I think that for me District will just remain a place for drinks and small bites.    I'm not going to lose my mind over this place.  It's not that great, I'd say it's fairly generic.  But the staff was friendly and it's within walking distance of my place.  I'm sure I will be back for drinks.",

John V's 6-volume essay is more descriptive than anything I have the energy to write, but suffice it to say that it's very chic, has a cool lounge, and a nice-looking restaurant with an outdoor patio that faces Van Buren and 3rd Streets. I do agree that it's got a little bit of that Scottsdale-douche aftertaste to it that clashes with the non-corporate image of downtown Phoenix's favorite venues, but I'm all in favor of diversity.   After looking around a bit, I sidled up to the bar to have a beer with a friend and was surprised to see microbrews on the drink list for only $3.75. The bartender found out I was a downtown resident and made it a point to let me know that they have happy hour specials every night.  (Great. Like what I really need in my life right now is more beer.)  Light Rail stop: Central/Van Buren or 1st Ave/Van Buren, 2-3 minute walk.",

Wash it all down with a $3.75 (seriously) microbrew & don't forget to save room for dessert. The pumpkin whoopie pies served with a mini bourbon malt shake will make you greedy & not want to share, but you will because you get 3.

    "text": "I went here the other night with a friend while staying at the Sheraton Phoenix on business, and was pleasantly surprised. While I'm not about to claim that it's the most fabulous cuisine I've ever had, I think JB C.'s characterization of \"uninspired\" seems a bit harsh.  Personally, I thought that the ambiance was great, and we couldn't have asked for a better waitress...very friendly, super sweet and attentive, all of which I value in a server. My friend and I were catching up for awhile before we had the chance to breathe and take a look at our menus, and she minimally interupted us, which I appreciated.   When we finally did end up ordering, I started with the Curtis Heritage Cuvee M, which was simply delightful! And what I loved was that they brought a glass and a half, rather than just a glass....yum! I also ordered a small cup of the Baked Tomato Soup, which comes with Fontina Cheese all melted over the top...it was pretty tasty, and I don't particularly love tomato soup. The cheese was almost a little too much for me, but otherwise delicious.   For dinner, I ordered the Organic Berkshire Pork Tenderloin, which came with sides of homemade applesauce and mac n' cheese. The pork was excellent...very tender and flavored with a Memphis BBQ sauce that lent itself very well to the pork...I would order this again in a heartbeat (and probably will, since it's offered on their room service menu!). The applesauce was...interesting. It was the soupiest applesauce I've ever seen...but surprisingly not too bad tasting, in the end. The mac n' cheese was nothing special...I can make it better at home, so if I ordered this again, I'd see if maybe I could substitute the mac n' cheese for something else (which is surprising for me, since I love mac n' cheese). Overall, I enjoyed it very much, and won't hestitate to go the room-service route every now and again while I'm working in Phoenix.",

Warning--sandwiches don't come with fries, so if you want them, order them as a side. I had the chicken panini and my guest had the shortrib sandwich and we were both very pleased. I will note that I would suggest asking for a bread substitution on the shortrib sandwich--I thought ciabatta would have been a better choice.   All in all, a great experience. I was concerned about being underdressed in jeans, and while most people were dressed for business, there was nothing snooty about this place. Very elegant yet inviting atmosphere. The hostess was charming, and a manager stopped by our table to check in, which is always appreciated.   I work next door, and will definitely be back for Happy Hour in the future!

This actually started to get stressful as we were supposed to see Kathy Griffin at the Dodge.. we did manage to get the check in time and made the show. However charging us gratuity in the bar was fucking bullshit since they would not do separate checks.. we should have pretended that we weren't together! With this kind of shitty service I would have NOT tipped 18%, maybe 10%, if they were cute!",

I munched on it, as a less-adventuresome dining companion ordered it and was unable to finish it, and really enjoyed it.  I think everyone really enjoyed their meals, and I know I can't wait to get back and try what I missed!",

One of my biggest things is service and they really nail it. Top rate venue even with small children.",

The side dish was a risotto with shrimp and asparagus. Only 1 piece of shrimp but the flavor very good and nice and creamy. All this for $9?  A very good deal. I also had a glass of wine $14 and a salted caramel dessert $6 and a cup of coffee $3.50 so bill quickly rose to $35.  Atmosphere airy and open. I dined alone and brought my kindle. Was seated at a table for two and didn't fee odd at all. Bench seat comfortable and I read my kindle and enjoyed a delicious lunch. Several people around me had the salmon too, must be popular.  Am staying at the Sheraton for 3 more nights for a conference. I will be back",

The service however was terrible.  Really really awful.  We had to ask several times for items such as an extra napkin, lemon for water, and at the end of the meal we couldn't find someone for almost 20 minutes to get our check.  We were celebrating a birthday and they said they were getting a dessert.... huh?  I would've thought they would have checked with us on this. I was dining with my 80+ yo parents and we really needed to get the check to get them home.  I gave them a bad review, similar to this, on open table and requested a call from the manager to discuss.  No call in over a week, I guess this shows how much they want to improve their service.",

They have jumped on the fresh bus, harvest their own herbs from a rooftop garden and have a changing menu. Only complaints would be that we didn't receive the bread basket or olives all the other tables got. Plus there were some service snafus (forgot coffee, brought the app 2x). But this place really shines on the menu.  - crab cakes - bacon wrapped dates - plank salmon - shrimp tacos - seared scallops - Mac and cheese with sausages - apple pop tart with toffee ice cream - lemon Cotton candy  We loved all the main dishes. The sides weren't as strong (I.e. asparagus risotto). The shrimp tacos were very yummy, but not enough for a meal. At $22.00, they were a rip off compared to the $12.00 trio of crab cakes. All in all, loved the food, and we'll return!  Bonus: validation covered 100% of parking",

I read good reviews about this place, but was very disappointed (to say the lease) when I actually dined there this past Sunday.    The list of entrees was discounted for the summer, which was nice, but that didn't make up for their service.....or lack there of.  The only thing they delivered quickly was the bread basket.....everything else took a ridiculous amount of time.    The first question I had regarding cocktails, didn't help start us off on the right foot.  The menu states they have a cocktail of the day.  I inquired about it, which I was told that because they had a large party that was taking up the bartenders time, they didn't have on that day.  Excuse me?  Because your restaurant scheduled a large party, yet didn't have staff the rest of the restaurant accordingly, isn't my or any other customer's fault.  Strike 1.  The cocktail I did actually order....the bartender came back (after too much time) to finally let me know that they weren't able to make that drink....Strike 2.  The drinks aren't cheap here....$10 plus....and they came out in the tiniest glasses I've ever seen.  The prices they're charging for the \"drink\" that you receive isn't worth it.  I got a shot-sized drink.  I can go somewhere else and pay less for a decent sized drink with actual alcohol in it.  Not only were they expensive, but they took forever to get to us.  Our waiter apologized for the delay by saying...\"the manager was at the bar watching and made the bartender nervous\".  Excuse me?  Isn't this your job?  Isn't the manager supposed to come out and watch you every now and then?  I don't understand how that would prolong the making of our drinks????  Strike 3.  Our food didn't take horribly long to come out....and it wasn't bad.  My steak was prepared correctly, which a lot of restaurants fail to do. This gave them a couple points back....but not many.  It then took too long to finish the checkout process with our tab and whatnot.  With so many places to choose from.....I will most definitely not be returning.",

I was excited to try their sliders featured on happy hour that were described as Wagyu beef 'meatloaf' with root beer ketchup, spicy pickles, and shallots on a rye bun and were inexpensive at only $4.50. Unfortunately, they were not very good at all. They had a very off taste to them... hard to describe... but not juicy or flavorful... I couldn't even taste the ketchup... I don't think there were shallots on it... and when I bit into the slider, the meat was kind of mushy and fell out of the sides... pretty unappetizing. We also had the bacon wrapped dates, which were actually good (but it's hard to mess up dates wrapped in bacon). My friend had their special cocktail of the day, which was some peach concoction... it was pretty awful, extreme alcohol -y taste and generally not pleasant. Maybe their regular menu is better, but I don't think I would come here again to find out.   PS When we got there, we talked for awhile and then pulled out our phones to check in while we were waiting... the bartender came over and told us to put our phones away and enjoy each others company. I get that, but I think it wasn't his place to suggest it, especially since he had no idea what we were doing, how long we had been together, or the fact that we were checking in and that's it. I thought it was in poor taste.",

I tried the sweet potato fries (pass- too greasy, no crunch); the mac 'n cheese (the sausage chunks did wonders for this dish; the watery cheese sauce made this dish a definite pass); and the delicious award-winning apple pie (WINNER, but lose the chunk of cheddar... I like cheddar on my apple pie, but melty, thin slices, not in a square-inch cube!).  I also had a nice glass of red.  I'd love to go back again soon to try out their lunch and dinner menus.  The ambience here is VERY nice... If you can't stop for a bite to eat or a glass to drink, then, at the very least, take a stroll indoors.  Impressive, yet not too swanky.  Another plus is that it is directly across the Herberger Theater!  It's nice to be able to enjoy a refreshing beverage or a lovely piece of pastry before taking a stroll down to see a show...",

High ceilings, tons of natural lighting  The problem I have found in my last 3 times there has been the service. We have always sat in the side area to the right and it simply takes forever to get our lunch and leave. Very understaffed at lunch time. My advice, don't sit in the side area by the bar, stick to the restaurant area, there appears to be more servers there",

    "text": "I don't Love District.  It's something that I meditated on all day before sitting down to write this review. I have finally come to terms with the fact that I don't love the newest Downtown Phoenix gem, I simply Like. I had my first visit to District last night after I made a last minute decision to go celebrate my birthday a little early with Mr. Hottie. I was a little worried about getting a reservation at such short notice, but to my surprise, I was able to secure an 8:30pm reservation over the phone.  We arrived dressed to kill and feeling excited to try the new restaurant. We opted to use the valet which is free for the first 3 hours of your visit when you get your ticket validated. We were greeted very warmly by the valet attendants and directed to the restaurant. When the doors to the hotel opened, the first words out of my mouth were \"Oooh Pretty!\" The open floor plan of the entire place was just breathtaking. As we walked toward District, I even noticed the \"New Hotel Smell\" which was nice! When we got to District we were met by the hostess who found our reservation and walked us to our table. We were seated close to a big picture window with a nice view of the street. Our waitress, Anastasia introduced herself and subsequently butchered Mr. Hottie's last name (under the assumption it was also my last name) and said \"Heard it was your birthday! Happy Birthday!\" Ugh...maybe I was just hungry and cranky. She asked us if we had been there before and went on to describe the style of food, and when I asked who her chefs were, she asked if I was with Starwood. Um...no. I didn't let her know that a review would soon be written about this new spot. After she finished stumbling through who the chefs were, we were given a basket of black bean & corn rolls with a jar of chow chow & a flavored butter drizzled with honey. I wished the rolls were warm. I think they would have been so much better and possibly release the full flavor of the butter. I tried the chow chow. Wow. I was immediately transported to Louisiana at my Grandpa's kitchen table. Talk about fresh, crispy and tangy good! We ordered a drink before dinner. I had a glass of Mumm Brut Sparkling Wine; Mr. Hottie ordered the Ocean martini after our waitress stumbled through the ingredients of each martini. She couldn't remember the names of the alcohols that were used in the drinks. After a bit, it was like we were playing a round of an alcohol themed guessing game. Slightly annoying, but again, I thought maybe I was being over critical. It was time to order the food.  To start, I chose the chicken tortilla soup. Mr. Hottie chose the local field greens and herbs. The soup was served in a large bowl that came with diced chicken, diced queso blanco, diced avocado, a large dollop of sour cream and thin strips of tortilla chips. The soup is then poured over the ingredients. Talk about delicious. The soup was creamy and savory. The only thing I wished it had was just a little spicy kick, but the soup was so good on it's own. Mr. Hottie said the salad was just ok. The dressing seemed to be a little light in flavor that the goat cheese over powered the salad's flavor.  Just prior to having our main entrees served we had ordered a glass of wine to go with our meal. We were well into our meal once the glasses arrived. Points off. Oh well, on to the main event. For my entree, I had the Grilled Ribeye rare. The steak came with skillet potatoes, Toy Box tomatoes and was topped with chimchurri. The steak was perfectly cooked and the meat was extremely tender. I was delighted by the quality of the meat. The only bad thing about it was that it was a very fatty steak even for a Ribeye. It should have been a bit more trimmed up. The tomatoes were fresh and provided a nice bit of acid to the rich plate of meat and potatoes. Mr. Hottie had the Brown Ale Short Ribs. The entree came cheddar jalapeno grits and the meat was topped with roasted carrots. What can I say about the dish? The grits were an absolute tragedy. They were runny and came with a skin over the top of them. The grits were just soupy and disappointing. The short rib was very good. It wasn't fatty rather it was a rich slice of meat that was well seasoned. I didn't try the small bits of carrots that came on top of the short rib but they looked very good! For dessert I was offered a complimentary hot fudge sundae. I was full, but accepted it for the sake of trying it. The sundae came with a cold brownie. The \"hot fudge\" was lukewarm chocolate sauce.  So yes, you guessed it, points off. Our waitress comes fumbling back to our table to deliver the check and states that she gave us the wrong (and subsequently cheaper) wine. Ah. Points off.  A neat ending to the meal was the free cotton candy. I don't know if I'll return to District. Maybe to try some of their other small plates, and have a few drinks. It just isn't the great dining experience I was expecting, and I'm ok with that.",

    "text": "High blood pressure folks, watch your sodium in-take at the District.  I had high hopes coming here.  Nice looking place, friendly staff, impressive menu.  I gave it a shot... because, really, there's no way I'm stepping foot in the Hooters across the street.  I have this thing with scallops, so when I saw it listed on the menu it was no contest.  However, listed underneath was \"mushrooms, peppers, grilled Italian sausage.\"  Sausage?  Oh dear, but I don't eat pork.  I asked  the waitress if there was anyway I could substitute the sausage for the grilled asparagus listed under the sides portion of the menu.  She explained that the scallops were served on top of a mixture of the three items, but I could choose to have it served on top of the asparagus instead.  Sure, why not.  That sounds good.  I also ordered the baked tomato soup because of all the great Yelp reviews and good lookin' pictures.  While I was waiting for my food, the bread and butter came out.  The bread was sprinkled with what I think was fancy sea salt.  Neat... but was this possibly an indicator of the meal to come?  Soon thereafter, my soup came out.  I didn't even get tomato soup when I was a kid, but I feel like this soup brought me back to childhood.  It was creamy, not over-seasoned at all, and the cheese on top was just right.  I suggest saving one of your dinner rolls to dip in it and you, my friend, have quite the meal.    The soup was pretty hot, so it took me some time to finish it and by then, my scallops were ready.  My bowl was taken away and in it's place were my scallops... in the oddest shaped bowl/dish I've seen.  It was like a huge bowl with an asymmetrical curve so that it's like your food is performing for you in a mini-amphitheater.  It's great for presentation, but a pain to actually eat off of.  I had a hard time resting my utensils on it and it left no room to use a knife and fork.  Made me long for the days of plates and flat surfaces.  The scallops themselves-- 3 huge ones-- were seared to perfection on top of a bunch of supposedly grilled asparagus.  However, EVERYTHING on the plate was overly salty.  I thought maybe my switching of the other ingredients had somehow upset the balance of the poor scallop.  Was this sodium fiasco my fault?  I asked for more bread to counteract the over-seasoned saltiness of it all.  Alas, my efforts were in vain.  It was just too salty.  I went through 2 glasses of water and 2 dinner rolls.  My server apologized and asked if there was something else I would like instead, but by then I was too full from the water and bread that I just asked for dessert.  My server came back with the menu and as an apology, she said dessert was on the house.  Horray!  I wanted something nice, so I asked her what the prettiest dessert was (I'm a sucker for plating).  She suggested the apple pie, whoopie pies, and since she was a chocolate lover, the chocolate cake called \"Heaven Can Wait.\"  Wow, really?  I'll have that.   The chocolate cake was simple but decadent, drenched a rich ganache and.. a sea salt chocolate stick? C'mon, what's with the salt?!  Nonetheless, I still throughly enjoyed the chocolate... it was the perfect amount of sweetness to balance the salt.  All in all, I expected more than what I got.  One pleasant at the end of my meal was the free cotton candy with my check... one not so pleasant surprise was the $1 charge for the distilled water I was served.  Great staff, very friendly, but I'll come back just for the soup.",

    "text": "Yeah, I know, another update, but what can I say?  Honestly, District does not have a good enough rating.  I'm not sure if people are missing the artfully crafted dishes with a subtle twist on traditional \"American\" food or if they just don't appreciate impeccable service and delicious locally grown foods.  Whatever, more for me!  Yesterday we read a tweet from Chef Nathan that tempted us with the debut of the Lobster Pot Pie.  Of course we were there right at 5:00, we couldn't resist.  We ordered it and were served the most beautiful and impressive pot pie I have ever seen.  Now let's get something straight, pot pies are not glamorous, and they are rarely beautiful.  This baby was a definite standout and impressive to boot.  The pie stood incredibly tall on a large white plate and the mountain of puff pastry induced some serious jaw dropping on my part.  The crust was butter and flaky and it melted in your mouth.  The inside was TO DIE FOR!!!  There were huge tender, succulent chunks of lobster.  The veggies (potatoes, carrots, peas, carmelized onions, and celery) were all deliciously crisp and imparted just the right amount of flavor to this perfect dish.  The sauce that melded everything together was just slightly thick with a hint of sweetness that paired so well with the lobster.  I can't say enough about this.  Chef Nathan came out to chat with us about the dish and was clearly excited about it.  He earnestly accepted any criticism we had, which was none, and listened to me rave on and on about how good it was.  He bought us our drinks too!  He's a great guy, and if you ever go and get a chance to chat with them, please do.  I LOVE THIS PLACE!",

    "text": "This is a review of the bar at District, because that's as far as I made it there.  I stayed at the Sheraton for work, and after my meeting, was looking forward to dinner at District. Being that I was traveling solo, I wanted to dine at the bar so that I could watch the college football games (I also think it's more lonely to dine at a deuce solo). It took the two bartenders about 5 minutes to acknowledge me (the bar is not that big) but once one did, he recommended me a good local draft beer at the happy hour price, despite it being about a minute after happy hour which was cool of him.  I asked to see a dinner menu and was told 'I'm only allowed to serve the bar menu at the bar'. This differed from the experiences of others I read about on Yelp, and it pissed me off. The hotel is a business hotel. Your main clientele are business travelers, often solo diners. I've never gone to a restaurant where I could not get the full menu at the bar. The restaurant was at most, 2/3rd full so it wasn't as if the kitchen was slammed due to a huge rush.  I chugged my beer and took off to Kincaids. Later that night, I relayed my experience at District to the bartender at the hotel lobby bar who also found it puzzling but said that perhaps a meltdown situation in the kitchen lead the bartender to enforce the limited menu offerings. Not cool with me.",

Second, the food was quite bad.  We ordered small plates and a dessert, and none of it was good.  The sweet potato tots (which sounded awesome) were mealy.

    "text": "I was really looking forward to finally trying out the new Sheraton's new bar. Man, was I disappointed! One - it's just a hotel bar, and it *felt* like a hotel bar. I'm glad I only came for happy hour and not a nice meal because I totally felt like I was just in a hotel. Beer - OK selection (random New Belgium beers I'd never heard of, a Four Peaks beer I'd never heard of - how is that possible? - a Nut Brown Ale, a Lagunitas, a couple Hefeiwizens... all in all it was about 10 beers on hh special) that were only $3 on hh ($3.75) otherwise. That's pretty price. No wines by the glass under $10 or on hh special - bummer. Good sounding food selection on hh - notice I say it sounds good, but it was not good, not at all! We got the sliders ($9) and sweet potato tots ($4). Sliders (2) were dry-meat, bland little things that came with fried onions and some kind of horseradish sauce that was just terrible. Sweet pot tots came out *burned* (really?) and not finely chopped and mashed back together in tot shaped and fried, like regular tots, but simply cut into tot shape and then fried (or, in this case, burned). Which means when you bite into it, it tastes like a grease ball. They came with ranch (again, really?) for dipping, and (now I just sound nit-picky, but this place is supposed to be nice, right?) it was the watery, runny kind of ranch that reminded me of the kind you got in middle school.  My friend got the chicken wrap that actually looked pretty good and she seemed to enjoy it, and a side of fries, which came with ketchup and ...well I don't know the other dip was supposed to be. It was orange, so I hoped it was a chipotle mayo or fancy mustard that would help my tots. But no, it was thick - but congealed like it had been untouched and left out for awhile, and tasted terrible. I really can't place what it was supposed to be or taste like - the seasoning that came on the fries didn't help either. how can you mess up fries?!?! (OK, to solve the mysery, I just looked up the menu and it says \"Creamy garlic\" was the indiscernible fry dip. Um, what??)  Ok, enough bad stuff, here's what I did like. Root beer (Virgil's) on tap. That's pretty cool. And, my all time favorite part - the prints from Mexican artist Theresa Villegas they had up (though sort of out of sight by the bathrooms). She does these amazing prints inspired by the traditional La Loteria card game (her prints are of the same name). I originally heard of her when she showed at the Mesa Arts Center two years ago and have never talked to anyone who knew about her, let alone seen them anywhere! I thought that was amazing. Also, when the bartender overheard us talking about having ridden the light rail, she informed us that by showing our ticket we got 25 percent off our entire bill! Wow, that's a great deal (I think that only runs through the end of this month, though).",

    "text": "Every hotel restaurant I have ever been to has had sub par service.  Couple that with reviews heralding the bad service here and I wasn't expecting much.  We had dinner on New Year's Eve before a show at Dodge.  We let our server know we had a show and that we'd like to be done with dinner in about an hour.   He said it would not be a problem and definitely delivered on that promise. Considering it was a five-course dinner that was quite impressive.  We were out right on time but never once felt rushed.  And our drinks were refilled promptly, water and cocktails.  The food was great. I was also a little worried about that as it was a set menu for the evening.  I wasn't expecting it.  There were, however, plenty of choices on the menu. I ordered the pork chop served with applesauce (pork chops and apple shauce) and mac and cheese. The pork chop was cooked PERFECTLY and it was still juicy.  That's hard to pull off.  The mac was fantastic too. My boyfriend had the filet which he could cut with his fork. We had a duck quesadilla starter that was tasty as well.  I really look forward to coming back for Happy Hour and a sampling of the other menu items.   On a side note, we also stayed at the hotel that night.  The rooms are beautiful, the beds are cozy and the staff at this place is so helpful and friendly.  It was a great experience all around.  If you ever want to make an evening/ weekend of an event downtown, this is the place to do so.",

Food was good, price was OK but made it great was the 1/2 price promotion on a bottle of wine that they were running on Sunday nights. The presentation of the food is really creative and it makes up for the small portions. They give you some cotton candy after your meal. A nice touch. It is a great place to go if you are going to a play at the Herberger or another downtown event. Went back for lunch it was good but expensive for what you got. Will only go back at lunch when someone else is picking up the tab :-). As far as the hotel itself the outside looks like it was modeled after a Moscow public housing development but the inside is incredible. If you keep your eyes closed until you get inside the building you will be pleased.",

One thing I will say though is that their gimlets and gin and tonics rank amongst the best I've had. Sure, it's a hotel bar, but it looks great and the place sets a chill mood. The bartender I had was really friendly and would stop by to make to conversation and to see that everything was good. From the reviews, this seems kinda hit or miss, but  I guess I got lucky.",

We got a bottle of wine that was really good, then the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. Our dinner was the chicken and biscuits and the meatloaf. The chicken and biscuits was really good, but the meatloaf was actually quite gross. It's fried which makes it crunchy, but there wasn't much flavor to it and the fried greens on the side were drowning in salt. I was disappointed, then we got the creme brulee which was amazing. Also, we loved that they brought cotton candy at the end. It was a really fun touch that we have never seen before. Overall, we enjoyed it. I just wouldn't order the meatloaf again.",

That's a really good deal for $9.    For Dinner I had the Ribeye Steak, Brussel Sprout Hash (AMAZING), and Scalloped Potatoes.  Every thing was cooked to perfection.  The Brussel Sprout Hash was such a nice dish to try.  I might have to figure out how to make that.    This isn't a bad restaurant at all connected to the Sheraton.

It was caramelized with a maple glaze that was sweet and delicate and added the perfect touch of flavor.  I thought it was large for a lunch portion but better too much than not enough.  My waiter was Kaleb. He was very friendly and attentive. Well, as attentive as he needed to be for a table of one. I'm pretty low maintenance.  I definitely recommend eating here!  Food, atmosphere and location were perfect. It helped that I was staying at the Sheraton Grand which happens to be adjacent to District. And I opted to go green and give the maids a break from cleaning my room. That earned me a $5 daily credit that I used to pay for lunch. I DID tip my waiter on the pre-coupon total. Never forget to tip your wait staff. They work hard for their money.  Oh yeah, and I'm coming back for dinner tonight with my girl friends. The Pretzel Fondue is calling my name.",

I arrived there Saturday night along with a large group of authors. Unbeknownst to us, the kitchen was about to close. To our delight, they were willing to stay open to serve us. Wow. The food was surprisingly fast--especially considering the circumstances. I just wanted a snack, so I shared the hummus. The cracker-bread, the vegetables, the complexity of the hummus: good all around. I was happy to leave a generous tip in light of how they treated us.  Sunday morning, I visited again with a friend. District was advertising a $10 all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet during Comicon, so we had to try that out; plus, this gave me a chance to use my green program vouchers from the Sheraton. Our server was bubbly and enthusiastic. My friend was plied with plenty of coffee refills while I had water.  The buffet itself is small, but the quality makes up for the quantity. They serve up lots of local products like Schreiner's sausage. But here is what we need to talk about: the pastries. Whoever the chef is, they have training in French methods, because the layering technique in those little pastries and croissants is perfection. I asked the server where they got the pastries, and she said they were all made right there in the restaurant. Wow. That made me even more impressed with District, which is really saying something.",

The staff, although pleasant, seemed to be \"penny pinching\" due to the lack of hotel guests.  The menu was equally uninspired, even for a breakfast menu.    When my \"granola\" and yogurt finally arrived, the granola looked like broken up bars instead of the breakfast cereal it professed to be.  Even worse, looking more like dog kibble, it tasted like cheap granola bars broken up into a bowl, dry and uninviting.  Not suitable for humans.  Skip breakfast (probably lunch and dinner too if they cannot get breakfast right), its not worthy to be associated with the Sheraton name.",

I couldn't really tell you why. I didn't have the problems some people have with service. We went there before a concert and service was outstanding. We got martinis prior to our meal and they were made exactly how we asked. Perfect. They even have blue cheese olives. For some reason, everyone in our group was attached to the rib tips and grits with green chili I believe it was. So, that's what we all got. A couple people got a side of creamed spinach. The ribs were to die for. Not a huge portion but not the usual stupid large portion to get at a lot of restaurants. About the perfect amount.  They give you cotton candy when your dinner is over. Kind of unique and kind of weird at the same time.  Nothing would keep me from going back yet there was nothing so unique that I'm dying to return. It's a solid choice.",

The manhattan was absolutely sensational.  Who would've though I'd like a mushroom drink.  The old fashion was tasty and drinkable.  The mai tai was a definite pass - way too sugary.  The sangria was nice, especially for summer and hot months, and the District had a variety of flavors to choose from.

    "text": "This past week I had the chance to attend a performance of The Glass Menagerie performed by the Arizona Theater company.  The show let out too late to consider eating afterward so I hustled out of work somewhat on time and headed downtown.  This place had been pointed out to me a while back when I met somebody at Arizona Center.  And just this past week I had read another brief article about their happy hour.  Got there about 5:30 and picked a high top in the bar area with a view of the street figuring I would people watch.  I was greeted fairly quickly and put in my beer and food order.  Little did I know I would end up stuffed on just a couple of appetizers.  I ordered the buffalo sloppy joe sliders ($4 for 2) and the macaroni and cheese ($5).  I was afraid the spiciness of the sliders would make the macaroni and cheese bland. Not to fear, with the addition of andouille sausage the macaroni and cheese was anything but bland.  While both items were tasty I am not sure I am a big fan of either as I don't do heat well.  It was also nice to note that somebody else's cheese sauce breaks down and looses the proper smooth texture.    About the time I was done eating I changed my seat to the other side of the table and watched the second half of he Suns game while enjoying another beer.  The place is definitely a hotel bar and most of the patrons were business guests which has a particular vibe to it.  The happy hour pricing, which goes until 7 and again at 10 is quite reasonable, I spent $15 plus tax and tip for two beers and 2 good sized appetizers.  The service was good.  I would go here again for happy hour if in the area.",

Went on a Tuesday night, the place was almost empty except for a few singles at the bar and one other table.  The food: one word - PHENOMENAL!  Hands down best short rib stroganoff I've ever tasted. And I'm an extremely picky beef eater. Wonderfully creamy mushroom sauce and perfectly cooked fresh pasta. The short ribs were oh soooo tender and well seasoned. My other half had the salmon. It was very good, very fresh. But, my dish blew his out of the water.  I still crave that stroganoff ...almost daily!    A little on the pricy side (about $65 for two entrees after tax and tip). We didn't get fancy drinks, appetizers or desserts, but we were full.   I'll be back for my beef stroganoff!",

Everyone always worries about parking for a downtown spot and their parking lot is super efficient and they validate if you patronize.   The hostess and any staff we encountered upon entering were super friendly and we were quickly seated.  I was a little worried that we would feel underdressed considering we actually planned on diner-casual and not really brunch-casual but we were fine.   We took to the buffet and had some fun.  They didn't have the pancakes I was looking for but $29 a person for all you can eat and drink mimosas AND bloody mary's??!! Holla!  The omelette bar featured local ingredients (Schreiner's sausage) and some fun alternatives to the norm.    The seafood buffet had oysters, smoked salmon, shrimp cocktail and some gazpacho shooters (weren't my fave but worth a try).   Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and I would definitely go back.  I could see this as a great client lunch and am going to keep my eyes peeled for those specials.  Oh and McKenzie the server was fab! He was super efficient, friendly and fun.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I have to update my review with a downgraded 3-stars.  There have been service issues the last 3 times I went to the District, which I address below:  1. A group of 4 of us went to the District yesterday for Mother's Day.  My friend had called and made a reservation earlier in the week.  When we showed up, they had no trace of our reservation and tried to seat us outside (it was 100 degrees outside).  Then they tried to seat us in the bar, which only had tall 3-top tables (again, there were 4 of us).  They finally sat us at a 5-top table, which wasn't ideal because we felt so far away from each other, but better than sitting outside or at a table for 3.    2. The time before that, I ordered a glass of wine (simple enough, right?), and the wine glass they gave me had a sticky stem, and it was covered in tiny pieces of white cloth (that clearly came from the cloth they used to dry the glass).  So I sent it back and asked for another glass, but the second one was also covered in pieces of white cloth, so I sent that back also.  Finally the manager came over and he had personally dried this glass with something that didn't rub off on the glass.  3. The time before that, I had ordered the nachos off of the bar menu, which, because of the little \"D\" next to them, were part of the happy hour menu and were 1/2 priced.  When the waitress brought my bill, the nachos were on the bill full price.  I told her this was wrong, as the nachos were part of the happy hour menu, and she told me that they had been removed from the happy hour menu, but the menu hadn't been updated.  I told her that wasn't my problem and that the menu I ordered from said they 1/2 priced, so she said she would fix it.  She brought the bill back again and it still wasn't fixed.  So the manager had to come over and for whatever reason, it took them quite sometime to get the price corrected.    Individually, these events aren't a big deal, which is why I didn't feel a need to update my review.  However, 3 service issues in a row is indicative of some bigger service problems they are having.  I don't know if there is a new manager or what, but they need to get it together.",

Prices were a little expensive. You can order cereal for $8.00 a bowl. I can buy 2 Wheaties boxes for that price. Anyway I had the the freshly squeezed orange juice and the Sonoran Scramble. The Sonoran scramble had Schreiners chorizo so I couldn't turn it down. It came with a huge tortilla. You definitely get your monies worth here. If you're in downtown Phoenix and looking for a place for breakfast/brunch that isn't so crowded, I would go here.",

Nothing memorable, specially for a Wednesday in an almost empty place, but was OK.  We started sharing dates wrapped in bacon. They were good but after trying them I can tell you that bacon and dates don't match at all.  The honey chicken wings weren't good either. The meat was dry and the honey was... honey. It came with a mix (lime and salt?) which was super salty like in I-already-had-my sodium-intake-of-the-day salty! I didn't try the 5 slices of pepper that came with the dish.  I tried the short rib that one of my friends ordered and it was dry. I also tried the steak that another friend had and it was pretty decent. Although both of the friends who ordered steak said that it wasn't cook the way they requested it.  I had the salmon. It came with an extremely watery risotto that lacked flavor. The salmon, let me just say that I left half of it. My friends tried my salmon and din't like it either.   For desert I had the carrot cake. It was OK.  Also I have to say that the place is not cheap.  When I left I was thinking: So how does it work that my friends liked it but they complaint about how cooked their meat was? And they didn't like the salmon? And they didn't say anything positive about the wings and dates? Oh well, that's the beauty of opinions!  Cheers.  PS No wonder why they will change the whole menu within a month (according to the waitress)   Random fact. The door next to us (that goes to the patio) was opened several times and it did an uber annoying squeaking.",

The place is pretty sheik but you still feel like you're in a hotel.  Service was fast and friendly but I think it was our waiter's first night or something.  He was very awkward but it was ok.  I was pissed we couldn't get the happy hour menu/prices in the main dining room.  I know it is common practice for crowded places full of douchebags, but the bar and the main dining room were pretty empty so wtf?  I'm a vodka guy and their vodka menu is pretty neat.  They have 8 or 9 unique vodkas from around the US and clearly list their name, where they are from and the price.  What I didn't like was their martinis.  Pretty much the worst I've ever had anywhere.  Tiny pours and full of ice chips.  It was like a vodka slushy (oh snap I think I just invented something!!!).  Here is a rundown of the food:  * bread to start - excellent...love the lightly buttered and salted top * tomato and mozzarella salad - excellent - one of the best i've ever had.  great dressing and ample balls of fresh mozzarella. * pretzel fondue - the pretzels were excellent but the fondue and mustard were no bueno.  the fondu was gritty and the mustard lacked the kick that I love on pretzels. * burger - pretty solid but nothing special * mac n' cheese with Shriner's sausage - very unique and very tasty.  it was worth having once but I wouldn't get it again. * tater tots - perfectly cooked.  salty/crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  The only thing that would have made these better is some type of aioli or other special dipping sauce other than ketchup.  The main dishes of the other people in my party looked excellent.  I should have been more adventurous and gone with something more than a standard burger.  Maybe next time.   I was going to give this place 3 stars but I just can't.  They try to think out of the box to create dishes that are unique, have fresh ingredients, and have a local twist.  I will return.",

    "text": "Someone here had a mac attack!  Things have changed here, specifically the happy hour/bar menu, and all is not well. I once reveled about the food in the wine bar(WB). The creativeness of the dates wrapped in bacon, and their delightful macaroni and cheese(M&C). About 2 years ago I wrote about how wonderful their food was and how it reminded me of some of the great tapas of Spain. As downtown dwellers, we were in constant search for a place we could relate to, great wine and quality grub. The bar in the Phoenix Sheraton was hitting all of our checkmarks.  For 2 years all I ever heard from my better half was let's go over to the Sheraton and get some M&C...and we did many times. In fact we had been in there about 2 months ago with a grand daughter so she could try the sensational macaroni and cheese. It was elbow macaroni, crushed cheese-its, golden cheddar cheese, and sliced sausage. Mmm mmm good. If you think back to your macaroni and cheese experiences it probably conjures up memories of some buffet line you were in. Blah blah blah. This is where the WB had taken a macaroni and cheese dish to great levels. From what you remember, as a sad side dish somewhere else to, well, a main dish there at the Sheraton. Yes, it was that good! Nope, not any more, forget that. I am afraid to say, that after it was delivered, we did a full nose turn-up. Yup, I even asked for the manager to come over and explain why they destroyed such a sumptuous meal and turned it into a bland side dish. The Gray Coat explained to us that the Chef was changing the menu and trying different things. Well the menu stayed the same, but the quality of the food didn't. This latest rendition arrived as shells with a gooey off-white sauce, void of any taste other than cardboard jubliee. There were pretzel crumbs instead of cheeze-its and no meat. If you wanted meat that was extra.  Ok, I would be willing to pay for the meat, if they would go back to the old recipe.  We had invited a couple of our children and had raved about the M&C. What an embarrassment. After trying it, our kids thought we must have been experiencing an old age mental breakdown. They could not eat theirs either. We replaced ours with their tacos, very good! The Gray Coat made sure this was reflected in the bill. The 2nd order of M&C, was still on our bill when it arrived. Apparently the server thought if there was no complaint on the 2nd order, it must have been ok, even though none of it was eaten. What world was she in? There are some positives with the WB. They give you an extremely large pour of wine. That is correct, they do not measure it out for you. Thank you so much for that. Their wine is not cheap crap, it is most name brand labels, even for their house wine pour. You will not be disappointed with that. For the M&C in the WB, I say go elsewhere until this place gets their stuff together again. I will return to check up on this place because it is close to our domicile. Will let all of you know. For now, get your M&C at Old Country Buffet in Phoenix, you will be a lot happier. Shame on you Chef Sheraton.  For the rest of you, happy travels!",

Ordered at the bar, because that's what I do.  Duck confit quesadilla and a house salad.  Food was surprisingly good for a hotel restaurant.  Service degraded quickly.  Watched one of the bar servers sneeze into his hand with no wash to follow.  Got ignored after receiving food.  US/Mexico soccer and Clippers/Suns seemed to have full attention of the staff.  If I rated on food only, they would have gotten 4 stars.",

They have several premium dinner dishes priced at $22 for the summer. I had the fried calamari appetizer which came with a peanut butter sauce that I didn't care for but our waiter brought out cocktail sauce for me. The portion was large enough that I had it as my meal. The finishing touch of cotton candy \"compliments of the chef\" was a little out of place but we enjoyed it. As did the people at the tables around us...it was actually hilarious to watch a neighboring group shoveling it into their mouthes and passing the batch around.",

    "text": "I've been here several times for both dinner and happy hour. Although I have usually had slow service, this Friday was the worst.  I came in with a group of friends at about midnight for reverse happy hour. We didn't leave until almost 1:30 and not because we were having so much fun enjoying happy hour. It took us 30 minutes to get our food after we ordered, except my boyfriend. He had to wait another 10-15 minutes for the manager to come out and tell him they actually ran out of the corn dogs he ordered. Someone else in our group had also ordered the corn dogs and gotten them, so I don't understand how it took another 15 minutes for the kitchen to realize they were out.  The food that we actually got just wasn't up to par. My friend's potato chips were kind of soggy. The beef tenderloin nachos I had didn't even have beef tenderloin! Instead, it had scoops of the meat from the sloppy joe sliders.   I understand it was a busy night downtown with the Sade concert and First Friday going on and that District was busier than normal. I appreciate that our server was super apologetic about the service. But the manager seemed like she could care less, and as an apology she offered us a free appetizer. After waiting for over 30 minutes for food, the last thing we wanted was more food. When my boyfriend asked if she could just comp his beer instead (which was cheaper than any appetizer) she made a face before agreeing.  My overall experience with District has been good, and I will be back. Their happy hour food is usually delicious! But if they can't figure out how to improve the speed of service and make consistently good food, I may have to rethink my decision.",

    "text": "I almost didn't go to District. Almost. The maitre d' over the phone was pompously insistent on reservations...which on a very nondescript early Sunday evening seemed a tad preposterous. Huh, really? Okay, he's going to squeeze us in. \"Ten bucks says that place is EMPTY when we get there.\" No takers. I would have won too. When we walk into the almost entirely empty District I had to hold back my laugh when the same maitre d' sort of snobbishly queries our reservation status.  I have a really low tolerance for pretense. So, the whole evening started off on the wrong foot...but it did quickly improve. Every other staff member we encountered was great: good attitude; helpful. The ambiance is really nice inside District too. And on Sunday evenings they were having half off bottles of wine...well you don't need to tell me twice!  The food was way better than I was expecting too. Tell me how this place in the desert somehow managed to have the BEST Calamari appetizer I've ever had (...and I'm from the Pacific coast!) Amazing. The Filet Mignon was cooked to perfection and rivaled, dare I say out-classed, many dedicated steakhouses. Amazing. Everything on our table was great! The Short Ribs, wow. Oh, actually the Scallops were too salty. So, ALMOST everything was amazing. Still, overall, a very good gastronomical experience.  Besides the needlessly snooty maitre d, everything about my visit to District was top-notch. I can't wait to return. Hopefully the management will have a good talking-to with the maitre d' before then.",

The machaca was a bit too salty but other than that the combination was surprisingly good.  They also have sausage mac n cheese that was very tasty.  I had both during the late night reverse happy hour after 10pm. HINT: If you stay at the hotel, DECLINE room service, and they will give you a 5 dollar voucher you can use here.  I spent 2 weeks at the hotel.  Needless to say, we had plenty of drink for the 2 weeks my group was here (not too bad selection of beer) and i probably spent a total of 20 bucks The bar area never gets too busy, and they have lounge bands playing sometimes.  GREAT vibes, and some great memories were had here by me and my colleagues.",

I gave up and just ate the fries... which were cold. Our drinks were always empty, we spoke with the manager, who moved us to different tables (?) and the service did not improve, so after about an hour of this, we literally got frustrated and called it a night.  ....and I left so thirsty that I had to stop at a c-store, and buy a bottle of water for the drive home.",

    "text": "This review is for last night's Thanksgiving dinner.  It might not seem fair to write a review about one bad dinner after having had many other positive visits to the District.  However, while I have been amiss in positively yelping the District, I have verbally raved about this gem to my friends and coworkers.  That ends today.  Our family of three had the District's Thanksgiving fix prixe dinner with wine pairing for $50 per person.  Our expectations were realistic especially since we had had their Thanksgiving dinners at least three times before.  It is just a matter of soup to start, turkey with trimmings for the main course, and dessert to finish, with a wine option for each course.    My complaints:    1) Seating was horrible.  We had reservations and there were a lot of tables available.  Yet, they tried to seat us outside with the smokers and homeless people.  Then they seated us right by a door going outside resulting in our dinner being interrupted with cold gusts of wind sometimes accompanied by cigarette smoke.  (We did not protest right after we were seated as there was a row of glass doors and we did not know that the doors right beside us would be used as entrance ways.)  We were also seated right beside a busy beverage station.    2)  The servers were awkward.  They seemed to know what to say but not how and how often. Each different server (and there were many) that came to our table greeted us with \"Happy Thanksgiving.\"  They also seemed very eager to take plates away when we paused from eating.  Odd though that one server took our half eaten desserts but left a stack of dirty side plates on the table.   3)  They couldn't even get the food right. The green beans were undercooked (super squeaky), and the bread was dry and served without butter. (But the turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy were delicious and plentiful.)   Dessert was gussied up in looks but was so unsatisfying on the tongue, like sweetened whipped canola with pumpkin flavor.    4) The wine pairings were undrinkable.  My husband and daughter are not as picky about wine as I am and even they had to wince after each drink.  The port served at the end was drinkable, but far from good.  (We had plans to go directly to the movies right after dinner.  To get rid of the bad taste from the wine (which we barely drank), we went home to brush our teeth and tongues.  This is something we have never done.)   At $150 +tip, last night's dinner at The District is the most expensive crappy dinner  I've ever had.  It failed on all counts (food, beverage, service, ambiance, value)  and I will never return.",

However it's 96 degrees out side and I walked a circle of almost 20 blocks. The options are pretty limited to say the least.   Anyway I decided to try the restaurant in the lobby as they are having a lunch special. Nothing is over 9 bucks.   Let me say the place looks awesome. Super friendly staff. Relaxed no pressure atmosphere.  And yes yes yes. Good cold beers.   Now I looked the menu over and decided on a flat iron steak with old bay fries. The steak was cooked perfectly mid rare and the fries were lightly dusted with old bay. I can tell you that I will be at this hotel till next Thursday and this is not even close to the last time I will eat here. That's for sure.   Oh and bonus time. Some of the ingredients are so fresh and so locally grown. That they actually grow them on the roof top garden. Yes. Now how can you get more fresh than 18 floors above the restaurant. I'm super excited and pleased.  Adding to the review. Here for my second day and the beer is still amazing. Service is still 5 stars. And the lunch calamari with specials sauces is 5 star.",

The service is hit or miss, and I've been disappointed by the last two dinner experiences we've had there, so we'll probably stick to this as a lunch spot.",

We ordered bar food instead of the fancier dinner foods which seemed a bit pricey! We ordered several appetizers to share. Pretzil fonduemeatloaf sliders Crabcake sliders homemade chipsrolls at the table the brownie/cookie was too dry The drinks were good, but moscow mule usually comes in cool cup and it came it in a glass.  I don't know I would really go back there, but still a fun time with friends.",

After 25 minutes, we flagged down the waitress to ask for an update. She said the food would be out shortly. Another 25 minutes later, still no food. I caught the waitress' attention again and she looked surprised, as if she had forgotten all about us. We waited a full hour from ordering to get our meals. Also, we did not get a water refill ONCE during the meal.   The worst part: the waitress brought me the wrong entree!!! When I said, \"This is not what I ordered!\" she had no reaction other than to say that she would pay for our meal. That's nice, except I just wasted an hour of my workday waiting for my food. And I wanted a sandwich, not salmon. There were many tables around us that got their food before us, despite arriving at the restaurant after us. I have a sinking suspicion that our waitress didn't put in our order.  I wanted to discuss my terrible experience with a manager, but unfortunately already spent 90+ minutes in the restaurant and had to get back to my desk. I'm very disappointed in my experience today and will not return for awhile. Management, if you're reading this, please get in touch with me.",

Our server, I believe her name was Angela (I will edit when I find out, if this is wrong), was truly amazing. She got our food right in and made sure we had plenty of refills on our drinks and even gave us to-go cups.   The next day, service wasn't too great. We explained to our server, once she came back to us finally, we were on a limited time and we knew what we wanted. Instead of just letting us know what we could order that wouldn't take as much time, she responded with \"Well we can't rush the chef.\"  We understood that, but that wasn't something you should tell your guest.  Our orders came out wrong for most of the table but management did try to make up for it.   Tip: If you are limited time, make sure you make a reservation, look over the menu ahead of time and let the server know, as soon as she comes to greet you what you would like.",

It was literally 2 cups of quinoa with some beats and not anything spectacular as spices or sauce. I couldn't believe it. I checked the menu on line after leaving. They have the same bowl on the dinner menu but it has portabella mushrooms- which maybe if they did that for lunch it would have changed the taste (maybe?). I thought the menu wasn't anything crazy special and I felt like you were paying more for the atmosphere than food.  They have a $9 menu for lunch. Check it out once- see what you think.",

I came back to District with a group of coworkers on 12/10 around 12:15pm to find that the majority of the $9 menu is gone. No more steaks :(. I decided to take a go with the brisket tacos.   When my food came out, I found a black short HAIR in my taco. This has never happened before, and it didn't help that it happened on the day that I discovered the menu has changed. I got the waitress (which she is great, typically always remember my old order), and she quietly switched it out with a new plate of brisket tacos.  Now, at this point, I expected the manager to walk out, and provide a sincere apology, and maybe even take it off my bill.   No manager stopped by. In fact, I still paid the full meal.   If I had been anyone else, I could have made a massive uproar, and brought attention to the issue, but I didn't. My order wasn't just messed up. IT HAD A HAIR IN IT. It's mistakes like these that can ruin a business.  Unfortunately, I will not be coming back, and my company is aware of this gross experience. :(",

I was wrong on both front, not your average hotel restaurant and defiantly not Uber upscale. I had breakfast here two times, both times having the buffet which had a great selection. There was scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, gravy, fruit, pastry's, all very fresh and rotated very frequently.   I visited for lunch as well and had the brisket Mac and cheese. Let me tell you that it was probably one of the best Mac and cheese meals that I've had. Each individual ingredient was not overwhelmed by the cheese, standing out in its own unique way. All in all very good spot, hope to come back and visit again.",

From the instant, I walked through the door, hostess nowhere in sight and waiters seemed not to care that I was standing in the lobby for a good 5 minutes.  The hostess returns and appeared unapologetic and apathetic of how long I was standing there.  Strike one.  Fast forward, the menu did not offer many selection but I ordered what most appealed to me.  My waiter, John, took my food order after waiting another long 7 minutes for him to introduce himself as my waiter.  10 minutes passed, food finally served shortly followed by the check.  He didn't ask if I wanted anything else as I barely had two bites to eat off my plate. Not sure reason for the hastiness as tables were barely occupied. Strike two. As I was finishing my food, my waiter wanted my PIN number for my debit card.  I told him he would need to wait for me to finish my meal as most well-managed restaurant would do.  *sigh* Ordered dessert, waiter handed me a revised check before the dessert arrived.  Dessert arrived,   a few short seconds later, John circled my table at least 3 times to see if the check was completed. As soon as I signed it, he grabbed the check before I finished eating. Strike three.  Very disappointed in my dining experience at the District.  My suggestion to management is to re-train staff on the do's and don't's of providing excellent, hospitable service to customers.  I highly doubt I would return and may advise co-workers and friends to skip this restaurant.",

While we were eating, we noticed that every single thing we were eating seemed to be sweet. I had the Devils on Horseback which are dates wrapped in bacon with maple syrup.  The sweet was supposed to be balanced by a Chili pepper sauce. There just wasn't enough of it and the sweetness was almost overwhelming.  Had there been more of the chili sauce, they would have been pretty incredible. The short ribs had a slightly sweet after taste, but they were sexy delicious regardless.  The only \"off\" note, was the creamed corn  and potatoes under the short ribs.  It didn't mesh well--I suggest you ask for different sides.    Our desserts were both excellent as well.  I had the S'mores creme brulee and my friend had the Orange Coconut Creamsicle.  The chef and his or her sweet tooth hit a home run with both  and to top it off, at the end of the meal, they provide complimentary cotton candy.  On another note... The salmon my friend had (she said) was possibly the best salmon she's ever had.  So what if the chef has a sweet tooth?  Don't let that stop you, we enjoyed our meal very much.",

    "text": "I've passed by this place dozens of times when I'm in downtown for a ballgame so a friend and I decided to give this place a shot during Arizona Restaurant Week.  The place was PACKED.  We happened to come on a night when the State Bar of Arizona was having a big event which took up more than half the restaurant.  Still, the seating area of the restaurant was sequestered enough for my friend and I to chat.  As for the food?  The appetizers were probably a 2.5 out of 5.  She got the baked tomato soup and I got the honey lime cilantro chicken wings.  The wings were pretty good but had almost no meat on them.  The soup was okay but fairly predictable and bland.  The main courses were an improvement.  She got the short rib stroganoff pasta while I got the salmon with shrimp risotto.  The short rib stroganoff was actually much lighter than either of us expected and the risotto was an outstanding compliment to the salmon.  But the dessert was what really impressed.  She got a trio of ice cream sandwiches (banana with peanut butter, mint and oatmeal, and cinnamon and sweet cream).  They were small but bursting with flavor.  Mine was the berry cheesecake brulee.  Wow.  Might be too sweet for some, but the multitude of fruits in that dish was incredible.  I probably should've shared more with her.  Oh well.  All in all for $30/person (including a free glass of wine) during restaurant week, a pretty good deal.  At the time I write this, yelpers have given this place an overall rating of about 3.5 out of 5.  Thats about right to me.  The courses we had started off slow, but finished strong.  The place is probably more of a happy hour hangout for downtown workers than it is a sit-down restaurant, but the atmosphere is still pretty cool.  Worth a try at least.",

We sit in the bar area because the menu looked better and much more reasonably priced. If you sit in the dining area, you get a different menu that's more pricey. The \"bar food\" is only available in the bar. Okay, that makes sense I guess.   I looked at the menu and was a little put off.   My wife had the mac and cheese that was sprinkled with Cheez-Its. Um, that seems like something you'd serve a 5-year-old. She liked it. I had a bite and thought it was just okay.   I ordered a burger and got what I expected I suppose. It was definitely over-priced. I ordered sweet potato tots and it arrived like 15 minutes after the mac and cheese and burger. Totally disappointed. It's like, come on now. No one is here! You can't get all the food out in time? And the drinks were horrible. Almost akin to gasoline.   The waitress was nice though. Poor thing, we were probably her only customers that night.   Not going to recommend or come back.",

Interesting flavor combinations (the glazed, think pork chop with chimmichurri and a 'hash' was excellent) and attentive service.  Oh, and the complimentary cotton candy was an over-the-top treat! (especially after the S'mores Creme Brulee in the dinner options) Much better and more interesting food than expected for a restaurant in a hotel. Good modern American and the deal was a steal!",

I cannot stand a mandatory 15 minute speech by the server or host about how awesome the place is, or how special the food is. It is pretentious and cocky. Just let me enjoy. And enjoy I did. The food was spectacular. All by myself I could have tasted the quality of the food. We did order espresso, which tasted like watered down coffee, but it was a Sunday, and I'm sure it was a skeleton crew. This place does get my recommendation, but it might have to be a Sunday for me to return. I dont want to be preached to again.",

There was nothing bad about my experience: waiter was friendly, wine list was lovely with plenty of glass options for a solo diner, and the service was quick. At the same time, nothing was exceptional. I ordered the summer vegetables and tortellini (which might have been my first mistake... the people around me that ordered steak seemed very pleased with their meals), and it was a bit heavy on the pasta and tomato sauce. I expected more vegetables, which didn't seem unreasonable given the name of the dish. Again, not bad - just not great. Overall, this was a somewhat above average hotel restaurant that's perfectly sufficient if you're in the area, but probably not worth a trip out if the way.",

The table next to us also mentioned the discrepancy with the menus. They didn't apologize and the waitress acted as if she had no clue what I was talking about when I showed her the picture of the menu out front.

First of all, they have Oak Creek Hefeweizen there, which is one of my favorite beers. Its kind of hard to find here in the valley, for me at least! Anyway, the beers on tap for HH were $3!! Thats a great deal in itself. We were with a group so we tried quite a bit of the food off the menu. Let me first just say the two best things are the Mac and Cheese (phenomenal and addicting), and the Buffalo Sloppy Joe sliders. The pork sliders were also good as well as the sweet potato fries. The fries came with this yogurt/tzatziki type dipping sauce which was really great too. After about 9 beers, and a bunch of food, the total bill was only $54!   Parking downtown is hard to come by, another plus about this place is that, because it is at the Sheraton downton, you can valet your car for free for 3 hours and just get it validated by the restaurant. I just gave them a few bucks for a tip.   The service is also pretty great here, the servers are attentive. It could also be because there weren't many people there. Oh well, I wasn't there for the crowd as much as I was the food/drinks.  If you are looking for a great value for HH, this is the place to go. Parking is not hard, prices are great, and food is awesome!",

I had no energy to drive for my dinner meal so I decided to go against my own rules and dine at the Sheraton Downtown Phoenix Restaurant. The Bar and lounge is ample, live music that is not blaring in your ears and nicely lit were you can actually  see what your Food. Thus far it had my attention.   I was in the mood for some protein and nothing too large. I decided on the Kobe sliders. The portion is adequate with two over sized sliders. The beef was perfectly cooked to where it needed no condiments. The lettuce and tomato slaw had a piquant vinaigrette that formed flowing juices to the palate. Every bite was like e first bite.   The bread is a home wade brioche and lightly seared with a roasted garlic/pesto mayo. I ordered one slider with the cheese and one without as I like to taste the Kobe. The cheese is perfectly sliced and added a hint of smokiness. The flavors for this dish are a perfect balance in size and favors. It's the perfect bite and I can't believe I just wrote this coming from a Hotel chain restaurant. Kudos to the District Chef!   Menus and Wine list is reasonably priced. Wine choices are adequate and I paired it with a meritage from Santa Barbara. Will have to come back to try more menu items.",

The food and service are decent and they have a some great beers on tap, and at very cheap prices for a Sheraton bar, but you can never count on them being open late night. They have a reverse happy hour that starts at 10PM, but on a recent Thursday night, with about a dozen people still in the bar, they called last call at 11PM, 2 hours before the stated closing time. Another night they stopped serving around 10:30. This happens often. This is highly unprofessional for a major corporate hotel that states they are open until 1AM. Maybe the manager wanted to go home early?   Thankfully, local bars like the Lost Leaf are open when they say they are open. A great beer selection, walking distance from the Sheraton, and you can get late night food next store at JOBOT.",

Because I'm here for a convention, we get a small discount on food and drink which makes the prices reasonable. Lunch here can be a good deal, with their $9 specials (plus discount). Several of my acquaintances also here are whiskey and scotch aficionados, and I've seen them frequently at the restaurant bar (and smaller hotel bar in the lobby area), so I assume they enjoy the whiskey selection, for which they also get a discount.  My lunch option was one of the salads, with an interesting add, roasted squash. I liked the content of the salad, but I thought the dressing was a bit bitter/sour and excessive. Note that if you get an add-on to the salad, such as salmon, it is beyond the cost of the $9 deal.  Service was fine, and from what I saw, very good at the bar. This place is definitely an option if you prefer to stay indoors.",

    "text": "My husband and I had lunch here every day while attending his recent IUG conference at the hotel, and he had breakfast here every morning.    The food was undeniably good, it's True.  However the service was extremely spotty.  The waitstaff often seemed overwhelmed, and we received minimal attention most of the time.  Refills for drinks were hard to come by.  On one particular occasion, the waiter took our order, a food runner brought it out, and the next time we saw the waiter was him delivering our bill - never checked on us, never asked if we wanted coffee or dessert, just a silent bill drop off and never seen again.  It wasn't particularly busy at the time, and made us feel exceptionally unwanted in the restaurant.  My husband related to me that service at one particular breakfast was particularly disarming as the waiter kept his back to him while taking the order, which made for a decidedly strange experience.  So, while the food is good, and the kitchen obviously well-run, don't expect friendly or even standard service here.  We never had a meal with what we would consider good or friendly service during our stay, although some was more pleasant that others.  Their lunch prices - nothing over $9 at noon - are a bargain for sure, but be aware that sides are a separate cost, which changes the game to a pretty standard or somewhat pricey lunch, depending on your order.",

    "text": "District is just fine for a hotel restaurant. I had a work dinner here with a larger (8) group and there was plenty to like and some things that need work.  The space is great - appropriately dark, a great bar area, comfy seating. So it would be good place to have happy hour, or try to chat up that Regional Sales Manager you met at the conference.  (Why yes, those ARE Dockers!)  The wine list is extensive and includes some local AZ wineries (surprisingly good, you guys!). If you aren't a wine person they have a great cocktail list plus local beer options.   For dinner, our server recommended the duck, which came out \"duck and waffles\" style. Beautiful presentation for sure, but sadly the waffle was stone cold and rock hard and thus inedible. The duck itself was good but again was barely lukewarm. I think it may be a dish better ordered with a smaller group.   Service was pleasant but SLOW with very long waits between courses. That's fine, I understand group stuff takes longer but our guy disappeared for long periods of time meaning getting drinks, etc was a challenge.   Overall, it was fine. If I was staying at the Sheraton I'd probably pop down for a drink. I'd likely go elsewhere for food though.",

    "text": "HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:  SITREP: District American is a Hotel bar near the Herberger Theatre, across the street from Hooters and the Arizona Center. HH is Monday thru Saturday 3 to 7pm, with a Reverse HH after 11 pm.   AMBIANCE/MOOD: District American tries for a slightly modern southwest feel. The bar is off to the right as you enter. You see a lot of Mexican \"Day of the Dead\" ~ Dia de los Muertos artwork (photos).  The clientele is mixture of Sheraton hotel guests, walking with convention IDs around their neck and a somewhat older crowd.  MENU: Like most places in the Valley, the Happy Hour menu is a jumping off point for the Dinner menu or so I thought. We were told that we could sit in the bar area and order from both. But our server however quoted some obscure AZ liquor ordinance and said we could not.  Go figure.   The HH Menu (photo) is somewhat basic, but has several tasty items that you should definitely try:  Texas Brisket Tacos for $11, their signature Mac 'n Cheese for $12, and the Waygu Meatloaf Sliders for $10. All were really very tasty and delicious.   Other items that looked interesting, were their Crab Cake Sliders ($13), Downtown Dirty Fries ($9) and Buffalo Drums ($10) as they went by to other tables.   SERVICE: Our server was very nice, but maybe a little too happy to please. If I had a dollar for every time she came by and said \"is everything okay here?\"  There were also a few order mixups, but nothing too serious.   PRICES: Our bill came to $48.87, including taxes, with two cocktails, but before gratuities. The prices are slightly on the higher side for HH, but inline with downtown PHX overall. I would say District American is a solid Three and a Half Stars.    I have rounded up my Review to Four Star, due to the very tasty appetizers.   Enjoy!",

Craft beer is only $3 a glass, cocktails and wine are $5, and several of their appetizers are half off.  I had the Camelback IPA to commemorate our hike of Camelback Mountain earlier that day, and my wife ordered a glass of sangria. To eat, we shared an order of Downtown Dirty Fries and Buffalo Drums (both of which were half off during happy hour).  The Dirty Fries were covered in every satisfying ingredient you could ever want to go with fries: melted cheese, bacon, and jalapenos. I also liked the addition of the green onion (to offset the heaviness of the previously mentioned ingredients with some freshness) and the pickled chilis (to add some acidity to the dish). The Buffalo drums were fantastic too. The sauce was a little bit spicy and the chicken was juicy.   Both dishes and our drinks totaled less than $20. I'm really surprised that this happy hour is not more popular. If I lived in Phoenix, I would go to District all the time. If you are by the ASU campus downtown, you should definitely stop by District in the afternoon.",

I would even argue the best happy hour in the valley of the sun. Wings, fries, mac n cheese, hummus with veggies, and chips with dip each for about $5-$8 (1/2 off for HH). Cocktails, beer (try the Achocalypse!), sangrias, and wine each under $7. Everything on happy hour is delicious! Customer service is always great which is definitely a plus.

This is my first time having a po'boy and did not know what to expect and I did not google to find out since I like to be surprised. I totally loved the idea of serving shrimp with other tomatoes, lettuce, inside a bread. The highlight of the entire dish is the flavorful po'boy sauce.

    "text": "I was looking up weekend happy hours, and I stumbled upon this place. As I walked up to it, I realized that it was connected to a hotel and it looked really fancy, so I was slightly concerned with the portion sizes.  When I say fancy, I mean I felt underdressed.  Anyways, the hostess greeted us and said we could sit wherever we like and take advantage of the last hour of happy hour. We sat at one of the high tables, but we couldn't help but notice how dark it was. It was an awkward hour where the sun was going down outside but not enough to where the street lights and sidewalk lights were coming on. Only some of the surrounding tables had a light directly over them, and our table was one that just didn't.  The happy hour menu includes sangrias, a mixologist cocktail of the day, and rails for $5.  Five of the appetizers are half off which makes them around 4 to $6 during happy hour. Choices included mac and cheese, chips and dip, vegetables and hummus, french fries, and wings.  We ended up ordering everything but the hummus, and we were shocked by how big the portion sizes were.  The french fries and the mac and cheese came in skillet pans.  I got the mac and cheese for myself and I noticed that there was slices of sausage in it, and it was topped with cracker crumbs. It was absolutely delicious. As a matter of fact, everything was delicious. The chips and dip came with two dips: horseradish dip and onion dip.  I definitely preferred the onion dip, but I enjoyed both. We were all stuffed by the end and the strength and taste of the drinks just made everything better.  There was a live DJ spinning while we were enjoying our meals, and he had a good mix going. Despite being a little dim where we were sitting, I really enjoyed the place and I would definitely come back. It definitely seems like it could be a nice date spot, and I would definitely dress a little better for the next occasion. If you are ever in the area, drop by this happy hour. You will not regret it.",

The chicken was good but the salad and chicken portion size was so small, it was almost comical. I would say it was barely 2oz of protein there and maybe a cup and a half of greens. Of course they messed my dressing order up as well. They gave me a balsamic vinaigrette. I survived. I don't think it was a good value. $25 for not much food. Greens are cheap people!

The menu is small, way smaller than expected. And not that impressive. It is kinda pricey, but that was to be expected. The food was super nice presented. And it makes me happy that they really think it through before they serve. But taste-wise, I was not impressed. Not by our appetizers, and not by our dinner. It was bland and kinda boring. The servings are small, in a nice way..  So very very close to a perfect dinner experience, but fell on one of the most crucial parts. Sure when one go out, you do not only pay for the food.. but the whole experience, ambiance, service and the fact that you don't have to do the dishes. But I cannot accept a 'eh' meal.   That pulls it down. I have no urge to go back.. even if I realize that I could have had a singularity in mediocre experiences here. It is a possibility.",

The Cobb Salad was made with iceberg lettuce. I thought I was at McDonald's.  Our server was nice but a bit ditzy.  The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is the Calamari appetizer was good and the cotton candy free dessert was a novel idea.  I would never return.",

    "text": "Horrible service and down right dishonest staff!!!  I am going to attempt to simplify this review to make it as brief as possible. I took my family of 5 (all adults) there before the Eric Clapton concert on Thursday night. Our waitress was horrible. She took extremely long for every drink order, small requests such as silverware, plates, water, etc. you get the point.  We were drinking fairly quickly and between 5 of us there was always a new request when she visited our table so I understand we weren't an easy table, but that's no excuse for the horrible service.   Fast forward to the bill being dropped off. $176 and she casually mentions as she is walking off she included automatic gratuity of 18%. Last time I checked automatic grat is for parties of 6 or more and it was also posted on their menus. I explained to our waitress she was not as efficient as I would have liked and I would like her to remove the automatic $30 tip she decided to give herself. Now this may not translate well but when she brought the new bill back she handed it to me without even stopping. She continued her stride and no stop to apologize or say thanks for coming in. It was extremely rude. I then look down at the bill and notice a $26 service charge. What the heck is a service charge at a restaurant? I asked another waitress and she had no clue, so this was my cue to ask for a manager.   20 minutes later a manager shows... no joke! And keep in mind we are trying to catch a concert. He gives me some excuse about how the regular waitress got in a car wreck and didn't show up to work so we were the lucky table that were awarded her incompetent replacement. He mentions he took 20% off my bill and I appreciated the attempt... until I notice he only discounted the happy hour priced appetizers. On a $176 bill we only had a few small apps. The 20% discount was 5 bucks. Long story short, this place is a joke! I don't recommend them at all.",

Everything we ate was solid. We will definitely be back.  Of note: Duck is at its best at Chinese restaurants. Everywhere else I've tried it, it tends to be tough and bland. Not here. District has the best duck I've ever had outside a Chinese restaurant. So flavorful and delicious. The short ribs are also not a disappointment. For dessert, the salted caramel chocolate bar is heaven. So rich. So good. They capped off our evening with lemon-flavored cotton candy, which was a fun treat.  What we ate: -- Appetizer: Duck Quesadilla with pickled Fresno peppers, Crow's Dairy black pepper goat cheese and apple jelly -- Appetizer: Butternut Squash Soup with chipotle and mint crema  -- Nimbus Brown Ale Short Ribs with cheddar jalapeno grits and locally grown carrots -- Hudson Valley Duck Breast with celery root puree, braised duck leg ragout and mission fig vinaigrette -- Pumpkin Whoopie Pies with bourbon malt shake -- Salted Caramel Chocolate Bar with vanilla chocolate crunch ice cream and burnt marshmallow",

Let me start off by saying that we were on StarHot, so all of the food was half off...which I believe made a huge difference in our experience. The food was absolutely delicious, as was the bottle of wine that we ordered. Unfortunately, we waited over 30 minutes to get our drink orders taken, so that was a huge bummer and definitely tainted our liking for the restaurant. Once we were served, there was no attempt at compensation for our long wait. If we had to pay full price for the meal, I would have given District 2 stars. The experience for us was good, but only because of the perks of being on StarHot.  Overall, if you want a deliciously overpriced meal, this is the place for you. If you're staying at the Sheraton and are on StarHot, definitely come here--you'll most likely have a 4-5 star experience.",

The place works well for a formal business meal as well as for a nice romantic night out.  Food is just a tad overpriced for eating here frequently (at about $25 per main course) but that's expected for this type of restaurant. Bread was warm and soft and came with a sweet herb butter. Their cedar plank salmon was cooked medium rare with honey glaze on top, truly delicious. But I think the real rock star was the seafood risotto that came with the salmon, so creamy good with generous amount of shrimps and asparagus, mmm....For dessert I got the bread pudding sundae. Unfortunately by that time I was already stuffed to the gills and couldn't finish it. But I thought the horchata ice cream they used for the sundae was preeeeetty delicious.  p.s. park at the hotel (entrance on 3rd street) and get validated for 3-hr free parking.",

Everything about our dining experience was extraordinary!  We sat on the patio which was lovely, our server was excellent and the food out of this world.  I had the scallops which I would highly recommend.  Our friends are \"foodies\" and loved everything about this place. Additionally, we have traveled extensively and have eaten in some great places so know good food!  This is great food! Everything is fresh and the produce is local!  Clearly the staff is well trained as the service and the friendliness was abundant.  This is clearly not your typical hotel restaurant in any way.  An experience to not be missed if you are downtown Phoenix and want the best the city has to offer!  Loved it!!!!!!!",

Well, I've been here three times and every single time the service has been terrible. One visit I actually had to get up from my table and find a server (we'd been seated for about 15-20 minutes and no one had said boo). The other two times we sat in the bar and it was about ten minutes before anyone appeared. In my mind, at this price point, this is simply inexcusable. The bad service was so extreme that it dominates my complete memory and impressions of the restaurant and bar.  It's probably a fine place to go if you are traveling, staying in the hotel and don't know any better, but otherwise, central Phoenix has much better offerings!",

The first time I was there I had the pork loin with the mac n' cheese.  After being the last one getting her food by a few minutes, the pork loin = not cooked on the inside.  I told the server and he said, no that is the way that it should look and went on about how they cook it back in the kitchen.  When I showed him the meat...he then said \"Oh no!  That isn't how it should be at all!\"  Takes my food away.  20 minutes later...new pork loin.  With my waiting (everybody was done by then) not having it done the first done, etc...I should have thought that I would have been compensated for something.  Nope nothing!  Oh! And the server kept on forgetting to refill my iced tea...HUGE pet peeve.  2nd time was last night and my friend and I were sitting at the bar.  We ordered off the happy hour menu with the cheeseburger - no onion (me) and plain Hamburger with nothing on it but grilled onions for my friend.  And we ordered sweet potato fries.  After a half hour (and we had tickets to see Conan in another 45 minutes) our food comes out.  Mine with onions and my friend with cheese and no onions.  Oh, and no sweet potato fries.  We tell the manager the mistake and took our plates away.  We also told the manager and the bartender that we had tickets and had to leave soon.  10 minutes later...our burgers came out again.  Mine was correct, my friend didn't get her grilled onions.  The manager told us that they do not grill onions.  Ooooh-kay!  And still no sweet potato fries.  Uh, where are our fries?  The bartender never put it in the system so the manager made him do that before we could get our fries.   Running late....we scarfed down our food.   At least we were only charged for our iced teas for this catastrophe.  The end!",

In the beginning of October, I approached The District to see if it would be possible to bring about 70 to 100 people on a Thursday night at around 10:30 p.m..  Not only did they say it would be great, they would have drink specials and have the happy hour menu available to our guests. And also, the manager had told me and another colleague there's hardly any business on Thursday, so it was great to have an organization interested in having a mixer at The District.  Thursday night came, the level of customer service and professionalism that the manager gave us was HORRIBLE!  The way he treated me, others and the fact that we brought about 70 to 100 people there itself was definitely something to remember.  NOT only did they lie about accommodating our large group obviously The District could not do so, nor did the management team care to do so.   The place was already crowded with other guests which is great for them HOWEVER, the manager never tried to accommodate all our guests which they knew we were coming! ...for seating, passing out menus..the only way people were able to order if they were seated which they couldn't,  some individuals were waiting a very long time for a drink that cost $15, there were no drink specials besides the beer and possibly the wine, I never I saw the menu, but I do know people were not happy with purchasing a tiny drink for $15 a pop! The manager did speak to another individual with my guests at one point and had told him, individuals can not get drink specials at the bar, however, there was nowhere to sit , the majority of the tables were already pre occupied.   Also, the executive director of the non profit organization that I work for had ordered just a Dr. Pepper, he gave the bartender a $20, received the drink and never received his change, when he asked the bartender, the bartender took his name down and did not give him his change.  HE HAS YET TO RECEIVE HIS CHANGE FOR A DR. PEPPER.    I never received a thank you for bringing people to The District that night.  IT WAS VERY DISORGANIZED AND VERY UNPROFESSIONAL TEAM AT THE DISTRICT.   Also, the manager had said to me and the executive director  that we would receive free valet parking since we were at The District, we had to pay over $40 for parking.   It was a very frustrating night.   Bottom line, we truly did not feel welcome at The District.  I was put in the predicament where I had to clear up confusions and make my guests feel welcomed.  At one point had considered having a kickoff party and/or mixers at The District, bringing over 100+ guests, but after the customer service/treatment everyone received from the management team and wait staff, I am now reconsidering ever utilizing The District and the Sheraton. As for myself, I was very disappointed and had expected great service. THIS IS THE FUNNY PART!  I did receive (a week later) an email from Heinrich Stasiuk, District GM.  Very insincere apology, THE FUNNY PART...he attached the email to the ongoing inside conversation between the managers stating I was difficult (sorry but you promise me certain things, should be able to keep it!) also stated in the email \"but they made good money from us\" .if you are a business or non profit organization trying to find a place to hold your mixer or dinners, I hope either you reconsider or let them know you've read my review!  Since I was difficult, I'm sure they will remember me and the fact they probably made about $3000+ off of my guests.",

I guess I should have seen it coming though.  I have come to the conclusion that I must look very gullible.  Why else would they try to pawn off a brioche bun sprinkled with sea salt on it with the cheese fondue as the pretzel fondue appetizer which was one of the items that we specifically came for. The other was the Mac-n-cheese with Shreiners sausage which was just under lukewarm.  Lukewarm is also a good adjective for the service, we were a very easy going group but our presence seemed to annoy our waitress.  I feel this is more a reflection of the management though, the staff doesn't seem to have much support as the few times I have been there I have seen the lounge waitstaff look overwhelmed and weeded while the female manager is chit chatting with the hostesses who are not busy at the time.  Why not help out?  There is no sense of urgency from the management so why should the rest of the staff care.",

As evidenced by the steam that poured out when I cut it open, my salmon spent too much time under the heat lamp (I had asked for it to be medium-rare, while another in our arty wanted his well-done), so I told our server immediately, who graciously offered another. This one came out, literally and totally raw in the center. Though I like my food on the under-done side, this was disgusting. It felt like a \"gotcha\" from the kitchen; wholly uncalled-for, and it felt very insulting. Not to mention inedible. I flagged down our server, who of course apologized profusely (it was not her fault). She took it away. Time passed (a lot). I ordered dessert. Our server said she would \"comp\" it to make up for the salmon fiasco. 15 minutes later we told her we just needed our bill as it was now 6:40 and we needed to get to the Herberger. So all in all, it was a pretty disappointing experience.  And their website doesn't provide any way to email them directly:  uncool.",

    "text": "I've been here twice, both times I ate at the bar.  This place is a generic hotel restaurant.  I've had the shrimp po boy sliders and the meatloaf sliders.  Don't even bother...while tasty, each dish comes with two sliders the size of half dollars.  The shrimp was especially meager as each slider had a single fried popcorn shrimp.    Last time I was here with my wife and a friend, we tried to sit at one of the high top tables next to the bar, but apparently for no good reason you cannot order entrees at the high tops (though you can at the bar).  So they forced us to squeeze into a space at the bar instead of allowing us to enjoy our meal in comfort.  The bartender had a better than thou attitude, also for no good reason.  My wife got the lobster pot pie which was nothing like a real pot pie one would get in New England.  My friend got the salmon which she did not like.  Neither of them finished their meals.  To top it off, some creepy old drunk dude who was there for a conference was obnoxiously hitting on my friend, to the point where he was physically groping her.  This continued to happen right in front of the bartender who did nothing to stop the situation.  I was forced to literally take the guy  outside and tell him that if he touched my friend again he'd spend the rest of the night in the hospital.  Hopefully I don't have to spend another sorry minute in this place.",

The wait staff is friendly and professional. The food is fresh and phenomenol. We've been there numerous times and every time is the same, a wonderful experience. Their managers are the best in the business and make sure their customers are taken care of but they don't have to worry about it. My husbands steak melted in his mouth. My pork chop was delish. Save room for dessert or you'll be sorry you didn't. If I could give more stars, I would have!!",

From beginning to end our experience was exceptional. The hostess was pleasant and the service outstanding. EVERYONE was so friendly and there wasn't one thing that we had to wait for from refills on drinks to promptness taking our bill. The buffet was very nicely displayed and the food was exceptional especially for a buffet. The fillet and salmon were prepared perfectly. The dessert display was so beautiful and each dessert so individually prepared it made it hard to eat instead of just look at. The prices were very reasonable for the buffet and bottomless mimosas (which servers made sure your glass remained as full as desired) and they even charged us for child buffets on our 13 and 15 year old and didn't bother to ask ages!! Management checked to make sure we were satisfied and gladly took the time to snap some family photos. Just an exceptional experience. Thank you District staff for making our experience so memorable. We will be back!",

Both have been pleasurable experiences with surprisingly good food and drinks, yet it is pricey. I like the ambience too. Overall, it has a good feel to it. The only reason I didn't give it a 5/5 is for the clientele/crowd. Being that it is a part of the Sheraton, there seem to be a lot of conference/business folks there. I wouldn't say this is a place to go if you wanted to be seen. Cheers.",

    "text": "So it may be a hotel restaurant, in a convention hotel, downtown... but this place is for real. The atmosphere is decidedly W, or painfully Scottsdale. It's got the color scheme of Sushi Roku, the vibe of a big city restaurant, and food for gods.   It is connected through the lobby of the hotel, but also has it's own entrance, something the other hotel restaurants in the area cannot say. District is also privately owned, so you won't fall victim to any Sheraton miscues in the restaurant here, just thier own which I have to say there aren't many so far. The restaurant is dark and mysterious in the lounge area, and completely open in the dining room, which makes for a great social atmosphere all around. They also feature local artists with the wall art changing monthly, and it's for sale too! I'm glad someone had the foresight to do that, rather than buy some mass produced crap from Malaisa. There is a private boardroom style dining room in the back, with two large semi private dining rooms, and another large dining table overlooking the restaurant, so large parties would be great in this space. I'm thinking the large table in the dining room is the best as you are almost on a king's throne above everyone.  The food follows the same cues as the atmosphere. It's familiar, but fun and exciting... they call it \"American Comfort\" and thats exactly what it is. The menu features Shrimp Po' Boy Sliders, Mussels which come in a ginormous bowl with an incredible sauce, Short Rib w/chipotle grits, salmon, steak, and other familiar dishes with a little local taste. Our table enjoyed everything including the Organic Berkshire Pork with Memphis BBQ sauce, Mac & Cheese, and Applesauce. Also on the table were the Mussels, and the Caesar Salad which might have been the only dissapointment. I ordered the Short Rib, and we all agreed it was one of the best we had ever tasted. They even made Grits delicous. It's obvious that quality has been taken into account as all of the vegetables and meats are locally produced and purchased from small farms. Queen Creek, The Farm at South Mountain, and Schreiner's are just some names that come to mind. The chef was kind enough to come out and introduce himself about mid-meal and I asked him where he came from, the answer pretty much explained the entire evening to me. He is the former Executive Chef of the late Mary Elaine's, Mr. Belosic, and he explained he was just having fun doing something people would be familiar with. There was a dish on the menu that literally everyone would be familiar with, from Fried Chicken or Cod, to a Ribeye.   The drink list is pretty standard on the wine side, but the beer list is much more unique, featuring almost solely microbrews from New Belgium, Oak Creek, and Widmer. There is even an organic beer on the list. Though I wasn't drinking last night, I thought $3.75 was enticing enough for a microbrew that I'd go back another day to enjoy.  Perhaps the highlight of the night for me was when the bill came, not because I wanted to pay, but because like other restaurants they bring a little something with the tab. Most places do the apropos mints, chocolates, etc. Not District, nope, this place brings you a big cotton candy on a stick, a la the state fair from when I was a kid. How cool is that? The bill came out to about $60 w/o drinks for 3 people, which honestly we felt was very fair, almost as though it were an underpriced Mary Elaine's meal. My only, and I mean ONLY gripe with the restaurant is more with the narrow visioned architects who designed the space. The patio has about a 3.5' cement wall, which is just high enough to make the diner feel disconnected from the street. It would have been really nice to do something glass, or steel, to engage the street and encourage people watching... plus it would feel much less confined, but oh well. I'll go back again, and probably again after that, especially now that I've learned they feature live music Thursday through Saturday.   Keep on Keepin' on District, and heres to hoping you open the floodgates of trendy, chic, urban hotspots in Downtown Phoenix.",

    "text": "I was one of the 100+ guest with Michele's mixer. It was crazy!! There was already a handful of people from a convention staying at the hotel in the bar area. Michele group came in and was just standing around all over (host station, bar area, circle area, hallways, etc), the District not enough tables or chairs ready. Problem is the District knew of this event and the area was suppose to be reserved. Instead we had a sea of people just trying to get drinks from the bar, because they had no table for the servers to take their order. I stood in the hallway near the restrooms and watched 4 managers (their had their name tags on their blazers, very important people) do nothing to solve the problem except for just watch the sea of people and their drowning servers. They were there for 20 mins and just left. I noticed there was another part of the place complete empty with plenty of tables and chairs, but that portion of the District was not opened for the 100+ standing guests in the bar area. I did not get it??? In this economy, doesn't the business want people to have chance to SPEND money? After 1 hour later, I got a dirty table in the circle area, but no server in sight to clear off the table or to see what is on the menu. I had to stop a server to come clean up the table and provide menus for us. The drinks, food, and dessert was fabulous!! It was not the servers fault for being inattentive, it was the managing team's FAULT for not being prepared for a reserved mixer.",

Having previously been an employee of the hotel, I was looking forward to being a patron of the restaurant.  It didn't disappoint. (mostly)  I enjoyed their hefeweizen. (Seeing a pattern here?)  I was feeling a bit peckish, so I ordered the cheesy corn dogs, because there is never a bad time for a corn dog.  I was not aware they were only half corn dogs. Alas, there were three halves brought out on a plate. (slight disappointment)  They were served with three types of mustard; horseradish, coarse deli, and dijon.  The mustards were VERY tasty, but I didn't care much for the color of the horseradish mustard; kind of purple-ish.  Had a couple more beers, and decided I was still hungry. It helped that it was now happy hour. :)  I was pondering the buffalo sliders, but I decided to get a hamburger. I was glad I made that choice. Turns out the corn dogs only made me more hungry than I thought I was.  The burger was delicious! (thanks, guys!)  Filled me right up.  I am glad I finally had the opportunity to patronize the District, and I look forward to returning again, and again.  Also, as I arrived too late to be seated in the dining room, I sat at the bar. Matt was the bartender, and I commend his service; my beer never went empty without the question of \"Another?\" being asked, and my food was delivered promptly. Matt also made great conversation, when there was a moment.  Only other thing I'd say; the coffee in the carafe at the bar was not terribly hot.",

The ambience was great.  Very modern and nice. The food was GREAT.  My boyfriend and I loved everything we got from the drinks to the desert.  The fresh berry drink was amazing and the bartender let us have vodka rather than gin in our drinks.  I got the scallops which were some of the largest scallops I've ever had.  They were cooked perfectly.  My boyfriend had the salmon with the shrimp risotto and loved it.  We also ordered a small side of the mac & cheese I had read about and it was one of the best I've had and I have had a lot of mac & cheeses!  Since it was our 4 year anniversary the server surprised up with a free dessert.  He brought us the devil's food cake.  We were so stuffed at this point but still had to try the dessert and it was also very delicious.  The marscapone push-pops were an amazing compliment to the dessert. The place was pretty dead for a Thursday night but most of downtown Phoenix is always dead!  I really loved this place and will definetly return!",

That's worked out so well for us that we think District whenever we need to meet up downtown. I've been there twice this week because they keep posting great specials on twitter. Monday they had a bowl of chili and beer for $5, Thursday they had a $3 cheeseburger that was killer. Watch for the specials.  Service is always friendly in a genuine way, I haven't had anything I'd say was bad, and the food is always presented beautifully. The best things I've tried so far are the po' boy sliders and the burger. I was meh about the moon pies, but they came with a shake that more than made up for it.  The restaurant validates the hotel's valet parking for three hours, so you don't need to worry about parking downtown.",

I had previously been to District for dinner and enjoyed the crab cakes. This was my first time going there just for the bar area. On Friday night, the place was hoppin'. People seemed to be coming from either the Suns game or the Arizona Theatre Company production across the street.   Great ambiance. Nice wine list. Yummy food.",

It has been about a week and I am still craving the Mac n' Cheese I inhaled during my Happy Hour visit. The Macaroni was cooked to perfection, the cheese was the perfect consistency and texture, and the addition of spicy sausage really set the dish apart.   While the service was impossibly slow, every waiter I came in contact with was extremely nice. But nice or not, I was sucking on melted ice for half the night while I waited to get my drinks refilled. No bueno.   The atmosphere was relaxing and casual, and the bathrooms were fabulous!! Well lit, great aroma, and my choice between cloth hand towels or paper. The bathroom had well placed mirrors which made the space feel big and clean.  I will definitely come back, but next time I might sneak in my own drink.",

    "text": "Decided to take a road trip from south Scottsdale and have dinner downtown.  Within walking distance of our next stop, District fit the bill.  I was really impressed with the design of the restaurant.  Great windows, lots of trees, inside and out, nice patio complete with a hungry kitty I spotted.  I was surprised by the lack of customers on Saturday night, but it was Halloween.  I decided to try something new and not have a meal before the meal, so we skipped appetizers.  They do serve bread before the meal, but it's just a standard dinner roll that really should be served warm, but isn't.    For my entree, I had the cedar roasted salmon with risotto.  The salmon was served on the plank with crispy shallots.  The preparation was simple, no special sauce or anything, but the fish was cooked perfectly.  The risotto was filled with shrimp, asparagus, and parmesan cheese.  Although maybe just a little on the salty side, it was delicious.  My husband had the lobster pot pie.  When it's presented, you will think it's ginormous, but it's really just the puffed pastry.  Once you pop it, it's a manageable portion.  We opted to share a dessert and went with pecan pie spring rolls.  These, too, were served on a plank with a caramel dipping sauce and bourbon chantilly.  Quite good, although I thought the plank made it awkward to share this dessert.  And speaking of sharing, you may want to ask about portion size before opting to share.  Our dessert was three small rolls that was perfect to share if you just want a little something sweet.  But if you expect to completely indulge, might want to order your own.  Unless, you're going to stick with the complimentary cotton candy at the end of the meal.  If they had a carousel out front, you could save a lot and skip the fair!  As far as service, it is a little slow.  But it's slow as in \"relax and enjoy your evening\" slow, not \"where the hell is my stinkin' food\" slow.  And the server did ask if we had a theater performance to catch, so it appears they make the effort to ensure you're out on time.  Definitely worth coming to again sometime!",

Since I had to return to work, this was a great deal (for my friend!).  Initially, waiter brought the incorrect entree out for my friend but immediately offered to comp it & get whatever we wanted in substitute; while we simply suggested we switch our plates.  Another server then came out w/correct meal & all was solved.  Evidently, water picked up the wrong meal in the kitchen?  Both entrees were extremely tasty (I had the stroganoff, friend the petite sirloin - done just a tiny bit more that requested).  Service was extremely attentive - perhaps because the full staff was there for the opening there were only about 5 other table occupied?",

Got there about 5:30 last Saturday so they weren't busy. The hostess first sat us at one of the horrible small two person tables but we had to move over one table because there was some syrupy food on the bench. I told the waitress when she eventually got to us and she said she would get it taken care of but it sat there the entire time we were there.  We had to request a wine list!!!!! HI!!! Isn't \"Wine Bar\" in the name of the joint? Seriously, it just went downhill after walking in the door. It took about ten minutes to actually get a bottle of wine once ordered. Then the busboy brought some freshly chilled dinner rolls. Why bother wrapping them in a napkin and putting them in a pretty bowl? To keep the cold in?? The calamari was actually good, the two sauces they brought to go with it were blah at best.  Entrees. Scallops still frozen in the middle! Crab cakes were barely above room temperature. Too bad, they could have been something. The best thing: french fries. It took at least ten minutes for the scallops to come back, what the hell? Scallops shouldn't even be cooked for ten minutes.  Will never return unless there's a giant \"Under New Management\" banner hanging out front!!",

Was greeted immediately and shown my table for two.  Has a nice bar near the entrance which you pass in going to the tables.   Sat down near the window with a nice view.  Server came to us and was very pleasant. We ordered some wine from the extensive wine list.  Nice selection and we had a Zinfandel and Cabernet, both of which were very good.   Ordered our meal which consisted of the Buffalo steak ribeye and the 72-hour short ribs.  Added mac and cheese plus the green beans as sides.  Started with the Arugula and Walnut/Pear salads.  All food was prepared and came out very nicely.  Salads crisp and tasty with nice dressings.  The ribeye was tender, tasty with great spices. Short ribs were not fatty and a delight served with a scrambled egg (my request).  Sides were like great comfort food.  Very tasty.    Just a very nice dinner experience.  District had it all: ambiance, service and great food.   Nice for the special occasion and/or romantic dinner destination.   Recommended for sure!",

    "text": "For a hotel restaurant, 5+ stars.   For a freestanding restaurant of this price range, 3.5 stars.  Surprise Best Part - Complimentary Cotton Candy at end of meal!  I went here on a Sunday night for dinner.  All the food we ate was good to great.  Downside was portions were smaller than almost any other restaurant we've eaten at.  They are almost \"tasting menu\" sized portions.  For a starter, we each had the mixed salad, which was outstanding.  One of freshest, best \"side\" salads I've ever had.  It all comes from local sources, including 4th floor garden.  Marinated onion was mind-blowing.  For entree, we both had salmon.  It was a perfectly great dish.  The problem?  It was about 3 ounces of fish.  No way it was 4.  I mean, it was tiny.  Did it taste good?  Absolutely.  But it felt like it was gone in 3 bites.  And for $24, I expect more than 3 ounces.  Come on, chef!  Don't be a complete cheapskate.  For desert, I had the berry cobler.  It was great.  Not outstanding, but definitely top 25% of any cobbler type dish I've ever had.  So, final verdict?  If you are staying downtown on a corporate travel budget - GO!  If paying yourself?  - Go to happy hour and partake, or maybe go here if not looking for a hearty meal, even at 3 courses...  I live downtown and this is one of the 2 best restaurants downtown for \"fine dining.\"  The other, if you are curious, is Nobuo Teeter House.  Which makes District look cheap.  Enjoy!",

The Beef was of high quality and full of flavor.  Just the right portion size too.  Next I had the Veggie Calzone....I have to admit, I was a little skeptical of that part of the dish, but they delivered....it was awesome.  The best part of the dish though was the Potato Salad w/Bacon.....that's right folks, it has BACON in it!!!  It tastes as good as it sounds.  The Bacon does not overwhelm the flavor of the Potato Salad, it compliments it.  It also has very sharp flavors and rounds out the trio dish well.  Well done chef, well done!  I can't wait until our next lunch downtown!  Return Factor - 95%",

The restaurant was nearly empty when we came in, which was fine, but it was 6pm and we expected a little bit warmer of a welcome. The host greeted us without a hello; simply said 'Are you interested in dinner?', which was a little off-putting. My fiance and I are both in the service industry, and know when it is and isn't acceptable to go into a restaurant (as in, we would never go into a restaurant ten minutes before closing time and demand service).   Our server was nice, but obviously very inexperienced. She brought our drinks quickly, which was nice, but after she took the order, we didn't see her again for probably 40 minutes. I liked the sangria, and my fiance's cocktail was pretty good, too, but not really worth more than the $5 happy hour special. The food was subpar; we had some chips and dip and meatloaf sliders. One of the dips tasted like Cheez Wiz, but the other one was fine. The chips were good, and the sliders were okay. The sliders came with what I assume was supposed to be onion strings, which were tasteless and pretty much 100% fryer grease. Most of the apps that sounded best were not discounted, and $12 for 2 sliders was a little much.   Our server never asked if we wanted a second cocktail, or even filled up our waters. We didn't see her again until everything was completely empty and stacked. Again, she was very nice, just not very attentive. We had to ask for change when we left cash, and when she dropped off the change she didn't really say anything. When we walked out the door, the host was too busy talking to a server at the host stand to say goodbye.   The place is cute, and the atmosphere is nice, but the food is overpriced for what it is and the staff really needs to be retrained. We won't be back.",

They also have $9 lunch deals and $22 dinner deals if you go at the right times. Pretty cool considering you can get a well-cooked steak for $9 at lunch. My main gripe as many others have mentioned is the service.. just always sub-par every time I've been.  At happy hour the restaurant bar has a $9 mixologist cocktail of the day, some reasonable house wine deals, and $3 beers, plus many appetizers are half off! You can have a few beers and an appetizer for like $10 basically, not bad at all. They also have one decent brand liquor for each category on special at this time too if that's what you prefer.  I work downtown so I've also been over here for lunch, and for $9 some of their fancier dishes are a bargain. You can get a great steak or salmon filet! The food quality is excellent, especially for the price. However, depending on when you go be prepared to wait. I've come to the conclusion that the lunch hour is just perpetually understaffed. Maybe its only for the summer, but it takes awhile to even get regular drinks out (iced tea/soda), let alone the food. With 8 people, our session once took an hour and a half from start to finish, though another time we were in and out in a half hour. Not ideal if you have to get back to work.  The main shortcoming of this place, now that I've been a handful of times, is that it takes awhile to catch a waiter/waitress for something no matter what time of day you're there. Even with a larger group of people, they'll often disappear for 15/20 minutes at a time which is a little frustrating.   Overall its a decent place if you're in the area or staying at the hotel, especially for happy hour or their locked-rate specials at lunch/dinner, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. Where they really shine is the food quality, and excellent mixed drinks. Service could really use some work. Rest assured I'll be back anyway, I work across the street.",

Nice amount of mini shrimp within the corn tortillas with accompaniments of guacamole, a spicy red sauce and onions. Good guacamole, I'm not a fan of too spicy nor onions. Overall nice savory and slightly sweet flavor with a lime.   The hummus was more liquidy than what I'm use to but still had a subtle spice I liked. Fabulous, huge! crunchy flat bread with sunflower and flax seeds along with what seems to be an afterthought of veggies pieces: cucumber and a random, tiny carrot sliver.   Very good drinks! I had the cocktail of the day which was vodka- based but I asked for a rum substitution which was gladly given. Also solid glass of Riesling available.   If I'm ever back in Phoenix I would go here again.",

Since this is connected to the Sheraton and we weren't quite ready to call it a night, we stopped by to have a drink.  It has an upscale lounge type of feel to it, with music to match.  Ordered a few beers, the sweet potato fries and bacon wrapped dates  The beers were both cold and tasted great.  I got a recommendation from the super nice waitress, and she called the right beers for each of us.  The bacon wrapped dates were awesome, but they back a lot of punch.  I had to eat them in tiny cut up pieces since they were so full of flavor.    Definitely try them during happy hour.  Our bill for three drinks and the food was $18.  Yeah, we did a double take as the appetizers were half off and the beers were $3 a piece.  Can't beat that...anywhere in downtown.",

All of my friends and I opted to do the breakfast buffet.  We were concerned we wouldn't be able to eat $18 of food, but considering that most of the other breakfast choices cost around $15, we figured the buffet would be worth it.  I tried a little of a lot of dishes, and there wasn't anything I didn't like.  Except for the fresh strawberries.  They were a little mushy.  The standouts to me were the REALLY CRISPY and not overly fatty bacon, the cinnamon roll with maple syrup, the fresh pineapple, and the gravy that was served on top of the biscuit.  That gravy was amazing - chunky with tiny chunks of meat in it and seasoned just right.  I would definitely come back here again to do the buffet, although maybe just as a special occasion treat, since $18 for breakfast is a LITTLE steep.",

It's a great place to meet if you are heading to the Herberger for a show or if you find yourself in the heart of downtwon PHX either hungry or thirsty.    They make a great burger and have some really awesome happy hour deals on both food and drinks.    I will mention however, that the service isn't so spot on.  Most recently, I sat at the bar with my dad.  We had just over an hour to order and eat before heading to see ATC's production of Lombardi at the Herberger, so we weren't super rushed, but I also knew it wouldn't be the most leisurely meal.    The bartenders didn't address us when we sat down.  After more than five or ten minutes, I finally got their attention and was told they'd be with us in just a moment... I went to the hostess stand to grab menus, and several minutes later, they finally addressed us and took our drink order.  We both went with burgers and I also ordered a Caesar Salad.  My salad never arrived, but I didn't mention it... I was just happy that our burgers came out with enough time for us to scarf them down before the show.  I will say - the burger was cooked just right and worth the wait!  Bottom line: From my experience, District is A-OK for their location and happy hour, but I probably wouldn't suggest it as a destination for the evening on its own!",

The tenderloin was juicy with a mouth watering glace. I could not get enough nor rave enough about this find.

My expectations were tempered and I wasn't disappointed, but will be more inclined to venture out as the experience was mediocre at best.  I knew I made a mistake as soon as the salad and bread was served. The rolls were stale and unimpressive and the salad and dressing barely ranked diner quality. The salmon entree was well presented but was grossly overcooked and failed to deliver on the menu description promise.  They have a fair wine list with some decent choices that are reasonably priced.  I also appreciated the chilled bottle of water that was left on the table and the service level was at least average.  Overall, a satisfactory meal, but wouldn't have anyone clamoring to return.",

We placed our drink and food orders and everything was brought over promptly. The food was quite delicious and everyone at the table was happy with their choices. And then it went downhill fast. Marcus brought us our check all on one, and after attempting to split divvy it up ourselves, he offered to split the check. Several minutes later he came back with split checks, very few of which were correct. One of my friends' bill had wine on it that no one at our table ordered. He didn't split the bottle of wine they shared or any of the other things we split, which wasn't a huge deal. When we asked to have the bottle of wine split and the incorrect wine taken off, he then left to go do that. Several more minutes later and the thrice revised bills were brought over. We then paid in our methods and gave him our bills. Several more minutes later someone else came over, confused at one person who wanted to pay part cash part card. That was clarified and we also asked for the change of the people who paid in cash. Several more minutes later, he came back with their change and our last friends bill to sign, which was again incorrect. However we had been waiting for over an hour just to pay for our food, so she signed it and we left. The food was delicious, but for a restaurant so close to the convention center to have such a difficult time producing bills for our group, it left us disappointed. Additionally, no one apologized for the confusion or delay, not in the 4-5 times they brought over our bills, nor when we all exited the building. Its one thing to have such chaos and confusion in the whole process, but to not even apologize is unacceptable.",

The mac and cheese is creamy and cheesy as it should be (they could add a little spice/pepper to it). The drumsticks are like lolly pops and have a slight Asian flair from the honey and crispiness. The meatloaf sandwich is good- slightly crispy on the outside, but fluffy on the inside (the consistency is not your average meatloaf).   Ambiance: Nice setting, more business casual  Service.  This was the downfall, and caused a removal of a star. Our waitress, Marena S. was below par due to a lack of people's skills and willingness to fulfill standard requests. It really changed our experience, although the food was good, this was overshadowing. She could normally be amazing, but we definitely got her on a bad day.   I still recommend you visit.

The decor has an interesting retro look to it and some of the seating is a combination of couches with tables and seats all together with Mexican Folk Art adorning the walls.  I ordered a Harvest Chop Salad. All the greens were fresh and the Chicken seemed prepared a head of time and didn't seem fresh made to order and was very bland tasting. The dressing was also bland. The salad wasn't a bad salad it just wasn't a salad I'd ever order again or recommend unless you were on a special diet prescribed by a doctor.  My husband had the Mac-N-Cheese. He enjoyed the Hot Link in it but said the sauce was very thin and had almost no flavor on it's own but did pick up it's only flavor from the hot link.  I also noticed that some of the lunch items are very large plates of food and others are very tiny so you might want to ask about the size of your platter.  I had a hard time deciding between two and three stars.   Dinner is probably better.  2.5 stars",

    "text": "A friend chose this restaurant for a pre-concert dinner.  I was surprised when we arrived at the Sheraton because I don't typically think of Sheratons as \"fancy\" hotels.  However, the hotel is beautiful inside and the lobby is quite high end.    It took much longer than it should have to receive our cocktails.  Our waiter explained that it was taking a long time on our drinks because they were serving a large party.  While I appreciated the explanation, it doesn't make my time or money any less valid.  If you can't serve other patrons, close the restaurant for the night.    The drinks were tasting but the size was disappointing.  A $12 non-martini cocktail served in a small juice glass...  No.    I had the herb roasted chicken which was really good but mildly disturbing because there was a bone sticking out of it (I have serious case of meat denial and do not like reminders that it was once alive... but that's my issue).  The chicken was cooked well and the flavors were tasty.  The grilled bread was also delicious as was the broccolini.    While our server was very nice, service was very slow.  It took a long time to get the check processed and we started to get nervous about missing the start of our show.    As I've said in previous reviews, there are just too many other good options downtime to come back here.  It's a shame because the food is actually quite good but the service and cocktail value needs work.",

Got water and bread right away, but then I just sat there at idle for 10 minutes watching 7 people go by me & no one to take my order. The place was not busy at all. Anyway, I approached a waiter (Ryan) and he gracefully/expeditiously took my order and turned things around. I ordered the tasty Cedar Roasted Pacific Salmon. It was glazed with maple bourbon...also served with sweet shrimp & asparagus tip risotto, which was equally tasty. This was a delicious dish, the best salmon I had in a long time.   The customer service was certainly rescued by Ryan. Outstanding job!! I'll be back.",

Craft beer in downtown Phoenix isn't the easiest thing to find.  You'll find Stone, Rogue, Black Dog, San Tan, Four Peaks, Nimbus, Lagunitas, plus I'm sure I'm missing a couple.  Nothing abnormal in the beer world, but in downtown it's rare to see an establishment like this moving away from the 'big beer' trend seen so many other places.  The craft beer movement is here & the District knows this.  The bartenders that evening, Mitch & Amanda, were quite knowledgeable about what they were pouring.  I learned some history about Black Dog I hadn't known.  No food this time around, but I'll still support anywhere that supports local like their menu does.",

    "text": "I have been to the District previously for Happy Hour, so my Husband and I decided to try out Dinner to celebrate our Anniversary. We had a great time, and will definitely come back again. We started at the Bar to enjoy some cocktails and an appetizer before sitting down for Dinner. I had made a reservation since it was a Holiday (Jan 1st), but the restaurant was surprisingly empty.  At the bar, we both ordered the sangria ($6 during happy hour). I ordered white and my husband red, we were not a fan of either and it was really disappointing. We ended up switching. My husband also ordered a seasonal cocktail. It was a house made cinnamon eggnog with bacon infused rum and candied bacon ($9). Not being a fan of eggnog myself, this drink was amazing! Well crafted. We also ordered the pretzel bites with fondue cheese and red wine mustard. I wish the District would bring back the old pretzel bites. The new ones are more like pretzel toast as opposed to soft chewy pretzels. However, I do think the red wine mustard is an improvement (not that the old stone ground needed improving).  The District was having a special for dinner and all entries were$22. We were seated by the window and the atmosphere in the dining room was very quiet and romantic. We were served complementary house bread and herbed butter (tarragon grown at the Hotel and local Honey). The butter was so amazing, I found myself wanting to lick the knife! I ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon with risotto. It was okay. I make the mistake of ordering Medium salmon when I should have gotten it rarer. The risotto was not as creamy as I would prefer. My husband ordered the chef's special of the day. It was a 12 oz. rib-eye with winter root vegetables, a cauliflower pure and blueberry demi glaze. I think my Husband thought he had died and gone to heaven. The dish was absolutely perfect! For dinner drinks, I ordered a 602 Mule ($10). The menu listed prickly pear as an ingredient, but it looked more like a standard Moscow Mule. MY husband ordered a glass or red wine ($10). Our waiter was so helpful and even offered to let my husband taste the two wines he was considering. Nothing worse than getting a glass of wine you don't like!  Our waiter brought us a slice of cake since we were celebrating our anniversary. It was very good, but we were so full we had to take it home to enjoy later. The District also give each table cotton candy as an after diner treat. This was unexpected and very enjoyable.",

It def needed more bechemel (sauce) but it was good. We also ordered the wings, and man were they hot as hell! I had a basil mojito, which was also awesome.

I met Amy and Korinna here for lunch one day during the week between Christmas and New Years.  It was a nice little walk from my building at 100 W Wash.  I didn't realize until I got there that I pass District everyday on my bus ride to work and I've always wondered what their food was like.  And I love that their menu is locally sourced.  The decor is a little more upscale looking than most of the downtown eateries.  For eats I got the baked tomato soup.  Tomato soup with croutons in it and fontina cheese melted over the top.  Perfect since it was a cool rainy day.  Totally hit the spot and I loved it.  For a side I got the cheesy baked cauliflower.  It was a bit bland but generally pretty good.  Service was OK, not great but again, it was the week in between 2 holidays so I'm sure everyone was in relax mode.  I'm thinking the next time happy hour is suggested for the office I will be requesting District.  So much more food I wanna try!!",

They weren't terribly busy, but the service was abysmal, the wine (I had the Oberon sauvignon blanc) tasted as if it had turned very, VERY bad and had a funky, skunky aftertaste to it. YECCCH! BLEH! Life's too short for yucky wine. My friends had the Louis Martini cabernet and said it was ok, but we, as a whole, were not impressed that day. One of my friends had been there earlier in the week and said the food was good, so we looked at their menu.  That being said, it looks tasty, but from what we saw being delivered to the tables, it is a bit overpriced.   It would probably be an ok place for date night, but I won't be in any big hurry to go back to give them a second chance.",

I had the buffalo ribeye per the bartender's recommendation and it was quite nice... a bit on the fatty/grisly side but it was seasoned and cooked to perfection. The mac-n-cheese side was a little underwhelming, especially because it had some wilted spring mix as garnish. The flavor was good, but my mac-n-cheese would dropkick this one to the moon.

I was excited as they were close to our business location and they offered plenty of gluten free options.  We seated ourselves and waited patiently for our server.  When she finally did arrive the first and last good thing she did was recommend a glass of Riesling that was fabulous (albeit $10 for the glass during lunch).  We placed our order, I ordered the chicken chop salad and my husband ordered a burger with fries.  When the order finally came, his came without fries.  We asked the person who bright the food (not our waitress) and he said we don't serve fries with our burgers.  Interesting because several people had sandwiches and burgers with fries.  Our waitress finally came to check on us and my husband, now halfway through his burger, complained about the lack of fries. She said she could put in an order for them because they don't come with fries.  He declined. But let her know he was displeased.  What restaurant doesn't serve fries with burgers?  Especially at lunch? Especially when the burger is $10?  Anyway, the food was extremely bland, as if they used no seasonings.  I was so excited about the blueberry vinergrette but it had no flavor at all.  We finished and requested the bill, I immediately handed her my card as we were in a bit of a hurry.  She had our card with the bill for over 15 minutes.  When she finally decided to go to the register we saw a stack of bills she was running cards for (probably 10 or more) that had accumulated.  Not a good idea for business people at lunch.  I would not recommend District.",

The service was very good, our waiter made great suggestions based on what we'd like and was very attentive. Best of all was the food. I had the Caesar Salad, which was decent, but the baked tomato soup was realllllllyyy good.

This restaurant is within walking distance from my work and when I have gone for lunch, I have never had to wait. The host is professional and poised. Unfortunately, the hostesses are not as much. But again, you can quickly look past that. The menu has already changed at least a couple of times which makes the dining even more fulfilling because you can keep trying new things! The food is definitely not average or casual cafe style, yet you can find things on the menu such as homemade chips, baked macaroni and cheese and a buffalo sloppy joe. The bar is beautiful and they have live jazz on Saturday nights.Great for a business lunch, a romantic dinner or tasteful happy hour.",

Happy hour from 5-7, then reverse happy hour from 10-midnight, featuring great discounts on craft beers, house made sangria, select wines, and amazing appetizers! Resident DJ Jared Alan sets up shop here around 10pm every Friday night to get you in party mode!  The District has a simple, yet modern, elegant feel to it. High class, but not overly stuffy or full of itself. The menu is the same: simple foods with elegant twists! The staff is nothing short of perfect: extremely friendly, humble, and professional. The crowd is a fun mix of rowdy tourists and laid back locals.  Looking for something new? Start here!",

    "text": "Yippie!  That is what I was thinking when walking into District for the first time.  Corny as it sounds, I was pretty excited to finally get to try it out.  After many, many months of my bus passing it every morning on the way to work, and drooling over their online lunch menu, I was finally on the other side of the glass windows.    The idea of their lunch trios makes me want to sing.  I am all about trying a little bit of everything so this is right up my alley.  And the happy hour snacks really had me hungry.  Sloppy Joe Sliders?  How could we go wrong?  The vibe is fancy, but not too fancy.  I was a little bummed that they were out of Pyramid Apricot Ale as that was one of my top five reasons for wanting to go there, however, I was quickly consoled by the creamy, delicious Oatmeal Stout (not Four Peaks, but it was still good).  The Sloppy Joe Sliders were good, but too good to share.  The order cam with two small sliders and I wanted them both!  Had to try mac and cheese and was not disappointed!  Beer hots, by the way, are slices of spicy sausage, in case any one else looked and the menu and wondered.  Buffalo bites satisfied my wing sauce craving and as far as the chips go, I would pass on queso and double up on the onion dip! The servers were nice and attentive.   I will most certainly be coming back to District for our after work happy hours (or Professional Networking Session as we like to label it on our Outlook calendars) and when the weather cools off a bit, I'll be walking over for their lunch specials!  See you there!",

    "text": "Well, our initial plan was to go to Tuck Shop as I've been wanting to try it out. Unfortunately two ladies got there 1 sec before us and got the last table, the waiting area was packed with a group just hangin' and they had a 16 ppl reservation for later. There had sitting available right away at the bar but I'm pregnant and my back is killing me so bar stools were out of the question. They were very apologetic, which I thought was nice considering if wasn't their fault. I'm glad they're doing well. So I asked my husband if he wanted to try District and off we went. Actually, I made a reservation in case something happened and well, we ended up there.  Nice and spacious, not crowded at all.  They were part of AZ restaurant week and we ordered from that menu.  Shrimp sliders- I loved them! They should have a big version of it! Duck quesadilla- Very good as well, but I'm partial to anything with goat cheese.  We both got the country chicken steak and it was really good. Mine came 1 med, 1 small pieces instead of a big one. The med piece was a bit dry and the breading was slightly burnt. The smaller one was perfect, juicy and crispy. The breading flavor was really good, slightly  spicy. The biscuits were awesome!! More of a cake-bread texture, light and fluffy and kind of sweet. Green beans were tasty as well.  Strawberry shortcake whoopie pies with lime basil sorbet ( I think it was a sorbet)- It was good, but not something I'll order again. The pie filling was too sweet, even the tartness of the sorbet couldn't help it.  Service was prompt, no hovering or having to wait for too long and our food came at a perfect pace.  Great dining experience and it made me forget about Tuck Shop. I still want to try it though.",

For lunch they do a chef's trio that is usually good, always changes so the server should tell you the soup, salad, sandwich combo. The quality of ingredients are higher end and they have some unique choices. Oddly enough its their tator tots and sweet potato fries I like best. Just had the Tuna salad, whole tuna in it, not canned chunks which was good, overall though it was just ok, needed some more kick to it. Pricing isn't bad for downtown, you will pay close to the same at lesser restaurants.",

I have never seen this place even 20 percent full, which is kind of sad.  The food presentation is very nice and it tastes good, too! They have some happy hour and late night appetizer specials, too, which are varied and yummy. The sweet potato fries and chips and dip are 2 of my faves. The service is a little slow, which always throws me for a loop considering it's never crowded when we are there? I usually have to ask for water about 3 times before they actually bring it... So I knock a star off for this. Also for the fact this place can get really expensive if you have a full meal! Better hope you are somewhat rich, or it's payday!  Onto the the main highlights! The wine flights! And beer flights! They are ginormous and have a great selection. The wine \"flight\" pretty much gets me drunk. Everything here is \"American\", so if you like some type of non- American brand booze, you are SOL. Besides the wine and beer flights, the drinks seem grossly over-priced, though. Stick to the flights!  I always recommend this place due to the location (bottom floor of the newly renovated Sheraton), decor, varied menu, swanky ambiance, and flights. Perfect place for a first date, any date, or a nightcap.",

The entrees are interesting, made from generally fresh ingredients and (usually) cooked as requested. When I've had to send something back, the server did so with an apology and absolutely no attitude.  The chefs are inordinately fond of salting the food, however. I always tell them to add zero salt, and then put just a tiny amount on some of the dishes.  The wines by the glass seem a tad expensive (for Phoenix) until you realize it's a \"glass and a half pour\" -- which means that a single glass can easily last through the meal. The choices aren't spectacular, but they work well with the food.  One item that has disappeared from the menu was actually a favorite: excellent french bread with olive oil. It's been replaced by a soft, buttery, pull-apart roll that I don't even touch. Apparently the bakery that supplied the bread went out of business; I hope the hotel will find a new vendor and return to what was always a great way to start the meal.",

The food was creatively imagined, but the execution was uninspired. \"Risotto\" was merely overbooked rice with something - shrimp in one dish, what tasted like chicken stock in another - stirred in. The salmon was likewise overdone, although salmon is at least sturdy. The roasted chicken was bland - it tasted more like stock than actual chicken meat. Side dishes are sold a la carte, but be warned that they're single portions (spinach was about a cup of food - and the garlic was barely perceptible). The service was excellent, and the specialty cocktails at the bar were very nicely made, but the food just fell short. With more focus on cooking technique and more attention to flavor, District would be great. As-is, there are far better options within walking distance. Caveat: if you -prefer- less flavorful, \"quieter\" food, this might be a good place to try. As always, different folks like different things - the many positive reviews suggest there's an audience that likes what District is doing, but I prefer a bit more refinement and attention in a meal. I won't be returning.",
