There was so much mayo in the crab it left a coating in my mouth (YUK!)  The Phili roll was warm including the cream cheese.  The only good thing was the bartender.  I might go back to try the tepen grill but won't be getting sushi from here again.",

I have a friend who works for Intel with a lot of Asians and they frequent this place a lot, which is how I came to discover this place.   The prices are good and are much cheaper than the RA or Kona when you take into account how big the portions are.",

We eat there several times a year and when my mother-in-law came in to visit last night from Nebraska, we decided to show off our favorite sushi place. We were told that they were just cleaning off a table that would sit 5. We watched several parties of two get seated, then a party of 4, then 6,  (4 and 6 came after us). I then went to ask where we were on the list and was told they were just waiting to be able to put tabled together to sit 5. They were able to this for 6, but not 5? After waiting for a while with two hungry kids, we decided to leave just ad they were calling my name. The young hostess goes to the other one, \"OMG, they are leaving? \" One of them looks at my mother-in-law and says, \"Byeeee!\" That's not the end, I later called to speak to a manager and spoke to Jen, but said it was pronounced as, \"Jun,\" when I started telling him about our experience, he cut me off by saying, \"Call back later. Thank you. Bye.\" So I guess it is, \"Byeeeee, Sakana!\"",

    "text": "I randomly get the worst sushi cravings known to man, so I found Sakana on Yelp and decided to check it out. We got there for happy hour, and obviously that means it's going to be busy, I get it. We walk up to the hostess and let her know there will be 2 of us. She responds, \"It's going to be at least 30 minutes until there's going to be a table, so...\" This is normally where said hostess would put your name on the list and tell you to have a seat, but this girl just blankly stared at us like they didn't use the crazy advanced technology known as a waiting list, which requires crazy things like a computer, or even paper and a pen. We awkwardly looked at each other for a few seconds, until I finally said, \"That's fine...can you put my name on the list?\" She actually responded, \"Oh, you want to wait?\", as if no one in their life ever waits for a meal at a restaurant. ...Darling, what is the purpose of the chairs in that little area in the front of the restaurant if not for waiting? I've never had a strong urge to eat my dinner there while people waltz in and out from dinner. She then asked us if we wanted to sit down immediately at a \"shared table\", which I thought might be something similar to the tables at Benihana - but no, it was literally a table we would have to share with two people already sitting having their dinner. Nothing says romantic date like 2 randos coming over with the hostess and sitting down to eat dinner with ya! We declined and waited however long it took, then went back to our own table. The food was pretty good - not the best sushi I've had, but certainly not the worst, a little overpriced even with happy hour and most of my review was just based off of how completely inept the hostess was, but I won't punish the food. :)",

    "text": "After many years of searching(with no luck), I was searching for a nice place to take my wife for a date when i came across Sakana. The site where it was listed offered no reviews or information besides a few pictures and location. I decided, being the risk taker that I am, to give it a whirl. We arrived at a little hole-in-the-wall place tucked into a small strip mall. Outside we found a packed parking lot and a line at the door... on a tuesday.   Sakana was just opening for dinner service and despite the tuesday dinner rush(still makes me chuckle) we were seated swiftly and with choice as to where we sat. Once nestled comfortably at the sushi bar we were greeted by Ramon, not my idea of a sushi chef, but boy was i wrong.    Itamae doesnt quite describe the skill level Ramon was on, he was masterful, and strangely I was not put off by him at all when he engaged me in conversation(I am not a public people person). Ramon you are great at what you do!   Now we are at the most important part of the journey, the food, which was delicious. We ordered sever different types of sushi: Eel, Blue Fin, Egg and Octopus. Lets start with the bad first, Octopus... I personally hate it, always chewy, tough and so citrusy i cant bear it. So thats the bad, now for the good. Blue Fin melted in your mouth with the consistency of firm butter and was excellent. The Egg was great aswell, sweet with a back end of head dizzying sake(not over bearing but noticable if you dont drink.)   Now for my favorite part of the meal, Eel, saying that I am an eel lover is an understatment, I dream of good eel, all I can say is that I was impressed and thats the highest compliment I could ever give to eel because I've never had bad eel. Also had a crunchy eel roll that was superb.   My wife ordered Calimari and Ramen both of which were delicous aswell, the sauce for the calimari was my favorite part of the plate. As for the ramen, if you want good authentic ramen with a smell that will cause people to come up to you and ask you what that is that you ordered, look no further.   All that for under $40 WHAT?! ive paid over a hundred for far worse!   After years of searching I have finally found my sushi destination. Thank you Ramon for the many wonderful times you have provided us with we will be back soon!  P.S. I have never left that place with out atleast one thing gratis(fish ribs were great but im too lazy to eat them...)",

They make a habit of bringing one order a full 15 minutes before the other. I am funny that way, in that eating with my fellow diners is expected. This is a recurring theme with them. Our waitress today never bothered to ask if we needed drink refills. (we did) She was AWOL most of the meal. I do not recommend you visit during the lunch hour rush. The sushi bar is very slow.",

The Cali rolls looked and tasted like they had been made 30 minutes before I arrived. The Unagi was outstanding! Huge pieces of eel, served warmed, tasty and filling. Service kinda sucked, waited a long time for a drink refil. Overall, average. Will return for sushi lunch special.",

Sakana has some specials on sushi during the week and also offers discounted apps when you buy a 20 oz beer. I tied the gyoza, which were your standard, probably frozen, gyoza, but they tasted fine. I also tried a couple rolls, their vegetarian jungle roll was alright, though it was not rolled tightly and mostly fell apart. I tried the roll with salmon skin which was odd. They had some more imaginative rolls on the menu, but they were really pricy. I would possibly come back, but it wouldn't be my first choice.",

The nigiri was powerful in it's simplicity, and the rolls were incredibly well constructed and  beautifully presented.   On top of that, the wait staff here really has their shit together -- like WHOA. Nobody missed a beat, everyone was helpful, and the sushi chef's were chopping and going through order tickets like wildfire, smiling the entire time.

I had a lunch special--the Sakana Lunch which was a tuna roll (with about 8 good size pieces) seven pieces of sushi, miso soup and salad.  Needless to say, I didn't finish the tuna roll.  My friends ordered off of the menu, and their food looked good.  I rated this four stars for these two reasons: #1--from the outside, the place looks a little scary.  It's in a strip mall, and the windows are dark, and there's a neon side that says \"open\".  Once inside, however, there were lots of customers, a welcoming staff and an open table or two to choose from. #2--the other reason for four stars was we asked for separate checks.  I paid cash--the other two paid with credit/debit cards.  It took forever for the waitress to come back with their cards and my change.  Evidently, what she had done was charge my food to my friend's card.  Then she had to figure out how to credit the card back.   In my opinion, an error like this is inexcusable.    If you check in on Yelp, you get free edamame.  Be sure to show the check in to the waitress.",

It's topped with a ton of crab with some sort of sweet sauce, maybe a mayo of some sort, and tons a little scallops. So delicious! They have a great selection of rolls to choose from; classics like the Vegas, Philly and Rainbow rolls and then some specialty ones like their scallop roll and the Sahara Rainbow roll, which is really spicy! Service is always friendly and the food never takes too long. They have a teppanyaki area too which I still haven't done because I love their sushi too much, so I can't vouch for that but eventually I'll try it! This is a definite must try sushi place.",

If I were to give any negative comments it is that the service can be just average sometimes, never bad enough to warrant a complaint.  I suggest the Garlic Parmesan Edamame to get you started.  Shrimp Tempura is also one of my favorites.",

The garlic Parmesan edamame was one of the worst things I've ever had. We sent it back and got plain. A good portion of their rolls are very similar and their base is shrimp tempura. My husband and I both felt like we were eating the same roll even though we got 5 different ones. It was not worth the $60 we spent. Despite the food, the service was great. The server even agreed with us on the Parmesan edamame and said she didn't like it either. Maybe that should be taken off the menu??",

The quality of the fish was very poor. Obviously once frozen and not fresh. To make matters worse they give you huge chunks of fish that really drive home how bad the quality is. Almost all of the rolls have krab meat (gross) and the rice they use is below the sushi standard. Every thing was just a mushy mess. This is also the first time I've had sushi and felt like I was in a TGI Fridays. It was a really unpleasant atmosphere. AVOID!",

    "text": "Until a year ago, I'd have given this place ten stars! My family has been eating here for well over 10 years. I have lucky-cat polaroids from almost every birthday. Plus, I can't even begin to guess the number of out-of-towners I've brought in or locals I've referred here. Sadly, since about ten months ago, I have had something negative occur with EVERY visit. This is not an exaggeration. In the 6-8 times I've gone in or ordered out in the past 10 months I have NOT ONCE been satisfied with my experience. Whether it was forgetting soy sauce and chopsticks in the to-go bag, messing up the order, or--my personal favorite--FORGETTING TO EVEN PUT MY ORDER IN until I arrived to pick it up, I've been consistently more irritated with the \"service\". To top it off, no one ever seems concerned when I ask for things to be fixed. Today my handroll was made incorrectly even though I repeated my order several times over the phone and the waitress REPEATED IT BACK to me. The best part was, when I drove back to have it remade no one apologized for the inconvenience, and I even saw the sushi chef chuckle and roll his eyes over the request. Rude and unprofessional. Then, the new roll sat on the bar for way too long before the waitress brought it back to me, letting the rest of my order get warm in the car. Even now as I write this and eat, I'm noticing that my salad lettuce is turning BROWN. Pretty gross. It breaks my heart that after so many loyal years I'm going to have to look for a new sushi joint. I hope Sakana's staff decides to improve their customer service before they lose any more long-term clientele.  P.S. Drives me crazy that they have no helpful menu on their site--just a list with no descriptions. I'm uploading the sushi menu for everyone.",

He spent a great deal of the night explaining where the fish was sourced, when they get their fish in, the difference between quality vs quantity ect. Once I ordered Mackrel, he told me it was from Norway, asked what other kinds of fish I liked --- Then offered me two pieces of Tuna to taste (as comparison) completely GRATIS!  Also, and I have no idea how this even happened...I was thinking out loud \"I wonder if they have fresh wasabi?\"  I see the owner walking toward me, and before I have a chance to inquire, he puts out a small bowl in front of me \"Tada!\" ...fresh wasabi!\" HOW DID HE KNOW!?  The meal continues to be amazing. The fish is super fresh (he showed me a picture on his phone of the tuna he brought in that day) and the service spectacular. These folks WILL take care of you...and make sure you leave happy.  Other points of note: It was someone's birthday at the table next to me, they brought out a drum and a sang a song for her, which I thought was cute. Also, the oranges after the meal, a wonderful touch. They're cut into small segments, placed back into the orange, and served with a little toothpick to pull out each piece.  The ONLY issue: The restaurant is small, and tables crammed. But again, when we sat down at a small two seater, I think I made a face because he took our menus, and said \"let me put you here...\" and gave us a larger spot. Very intuitive folks who care about the quality of their product, and the people eating it.  Nicely done Sakana...very nicely done.",

I come to Sakana on a semi-regular basis for lunch because it is rare that you can find a $10-12 sushi lunch that won't leave you disgusted or with stomach problems later. Sakana has the wonderful Sakana lunch which is $10 comes with miso soup, small salad, a crunchy california roll thing, like 6 different nigiri pieces, and a spicy crab jalepeno popper thing. Yeah you read that right all of that for $10 at lunch time. I am a hungry dude and it's rare that i can finish all that food because there is so much. They also have a very good sashimi lunch special that is miso soup, 4 pieces of 4 different fishes, bowl of rice all for $11 and again very good.   The fish quality while not gonna make you mistake it for fresh catch or the best california or Seattle sushi joints is still fresh and tastes like it should and not like its been sitting for days or gonna be confused with the stuff sitting for hours on end at Fry's. I actually think it's pretty good and they do a good job at switching up what is in the lunch specials for what is in season and fresh so you do get good stuff and not just plain stuff as they mix in stuff like blue fin tuna or toro belly. I like the sashimi because usually it is Tuna, Salmon and 2 other fresh catches that rotate.  Also try the scallop dinamite as it is pretty good for cheap at lunch.  Like i said though don't expect to be wowed as it won't happen but you want a good lunch for cheap this place is as solid as you can get.",

This place always has the freshest seafood. I am an Uni lover and get this every time if they have it.  Sometime based on CA weather they may not get it in but most times they do.  It is the best an most consistent. Their yellowtail is melt in your mouth delicious. I love their specials too whether it's bluefin toro, Spanish mackerel, oysters, it is very consistent and very good. Friendly staff, great sushi chefs, fantastic executive chef. I can't say enough about them.  It is usually busy so sometimes service can be slow but the flavor and freshness of the sushi makes up for it.

Finding high quality sushi in the Phoenix area has been a challenge for me as most of the places I get referred to are a bit too \"Americanized\" for my liking. Sakana is thou the worst offender of doing this. My husband and I went the other evening and ordered what we thought were 7 different rolls...nope-they all tasted the same.  Fake \"krab\" minced up and doused in mayo- minced tuna..again doused in mayo-and what didn't have mayo had cream cheese or was deep fried-ick.   Even when asking the waitress what was in the rolls (we like to try different things) she at no time said \"krab salad\"-she just said crab...so when I get rolls that have this stick all minced up with mayo you can certainly understand my frustration. The head chef came over and apologized-however stated that it was their \"style\" and that's how most of the rolls are.  Dinner was atrocious and you leave here with your clothes reeking of oil due to the teppan bar that they have. So money wasted on something I could have done myself with a jar of Hellmans and a package of VandDeKamp Krab and additional money wasted on a dry cleaning bill.  Save your palette and your money and go elsewhere if you are looking for good, clean, sushi. If you like all the mayo & cream cheese rolls then this is your spot.",

    "text": "Crazy busy place with lots of \"regulars\". It seemed like everyone was friends with the waitstaff. In fact, one of the waitresses was doing shots with a customer. Anyway, now to the food. I sat at the sushi bar since I was by myself. I had my usual which consists of Hamachi, Tuna and Unagi nigiri and a roll. The nigiri selection was fresh and tasty. The roll was a little disappointing. I can't rememer what it was called but although it was disappointing I still enjoyed my dinner and would definately return.",

Will definitely be going back.",

As a matter of a fact, I have been here 4 times for lunch in the past two weeks! Since I'm a bargain shopper I usually get the $10 lunch special which comes with a salad, miso soup, an assortment of nigiri, 2 stuffed jalapenos, and a California Roll. All of the lunch special is delicious you can even upgrade the regular Tuna for the Big-eye tuna for $1 more on special days. This place is so good I literally dream about eating here and I can't stop thinking about it until I go. The fish is so tender and fresh! This place is kind of small and Lunch is only served from 11am-2pm, so get there early if you want the special. One of these days I'll make it here for dinner to try the Teppanyaki, but right now I'm committed to lunch.   **This place does not have silverware on the table so if you despise chopsticks (like I do) you will have to shamefully ask for a fork or pretend like you know how to use chopsticks***",

    "text": "I'd like discussed my most recent experience at Sakana! I made a reservation in advance Incase this place was busy. I had never been there before so I wasn't sure what to expect going in. When we were sat down we were greeted by host that found my name on the reservation list and sat us down and gave us six menus total. Not sure why when my party was for two people. 15 minutes later I asked our waiter if we could order and he said we couldn't order until the rest of our party got there when it was already discussed there was only two people in our party and that these menus were for no one. After 17 min Of waiting for our so-called party that we didn't have we finally ordered our food when 25 minutes past and our soup and salad still wasn't brought out. I then asked for the manager and he came out to our table. I expressed to him that since the moment we came in nothing had gone right and that we have been waiting quite some time for our salad and soup to come. He apologize on behalf of the server and didn't do much else after that.  We were then greeted by our chef who felt really bad for the situation that had happened. So bad that he decided to give us both an extra breast of chicken for our meal. He felt bad that this had happened and was trying to do right by us by making it up with extra food. Once we were finished with our meal the waiter then came around and apologized after the fact and said they were a server down and that's why things were so hectic. He said he was going to try to get one of our meals comped. A few minutes later the manager Hong, gave us our bill and expected us to be happy with the fact that he gave us 10% off of our meal which equals six dollars. Not only did either of us take more than five bites of our food, we chuckled at the fact that a manager such as Hong would not go out of his way to make a customer feel like These types of mistakes don't happen often and that if given another chance they would show us that what happened today was not normal.  Or chef was extremely nice and sweet however the quality of the food was not the best and I don't blame that on the chef one bit. He was great at what he did but the quality of the food was extremely poor. My mom and I decided that we were going to try something new today because we typically go to Benihana. We both learned a very valuable lesson today and that lesson is this, when you find a good thing you stick with it. Don't venture away from a good thing! I can say with  100% certainty that I will never be back to that restaurant again. Not even if a gift certificate was given to me would I eat there. The moral of the story is that Hong the manager should have rose above the situation and did what he could to make sure that the customer felt valued and that they would be back. Hong, if you're reading my mother and I will never be back to your restaurant again due to your lack of hospitality and professionalism.",

Everything just seemed dirty. It looks like it hasn't been updated in 20 years. But I was starving. We still had to wait a minute or two as the place was pretty packed.   Once we sat down, service was prompt and friendly. No attitude when I asked for gluten free sauce. I got a hot green tea and it was very good. I also got a vegetarian roll, I can't remember the name, but it was super cheap (it was off the yellow sushi roll menu - we were not there during happy hour but the rolls on that menu were like $1-3!), and very tasty. I also got the yellowtail kama and the portion was HUGE! It was delicious.   My husband's experience was not so good. He got an iced green tea and it tasted like fish. It was so gross. I'm sure they store the iced green next to the fish in the refrigerator. Every item he got was overloaded with crab mix and drowning in sauce. Disgusting. Luckily my Kama was so big I shared it with him.  Oh, they don't have Splenda. That annoys me. No one has used the pink stuff in 20 years.  I'd say this place is a hit or miss. Likely won't be back because of my husband's bad experience and the place is outdated and seemed very dirty. The food that I ordered was very good though.",

Ramon is the best sushi chef I have ever known and Will tell you everything you could ever know about sushi and all the different types of fish. This guys just the man. I always sit at the sushi bar unless my parties too big and I'm forced to sit at a table. The owner or manager is always around making sure everything's always on point too. Sakana has ruined all other sushi places in Arizona for me. Get the large chirasi bowl. The rolls are amazing too, but this place knows SASHIMI.

The first time I came here the fish was fresh and the portions large and prices good.  Friendly staff, nice atmosphere.  What's not to like.  You know what?  i'm coming back.  That's right.  Probably the very same week.    Well... that was a mistake.  I sat at the same bar.  Ordered the same food.  The sushi chef was different though. Every piece of Nigiri I ate made me tear up.  I'm not always a complainer (vocally) so I didn't say anything and just assumed the chef was new and learning the ropes.  Well, the next day my stomach told me otherwise. I now realize the chef was hiding bad fish with massive amounts of wasabi.   I never went back, nor will I.  Also, I eat a ton of sushi.  I'm surprised I don't have mercury poisoning.  I say that to point out that my stomach never gets upset from even decent sushi.   The second star is because it's a game of russian roulette here.  You might get lucky.  If you'd rather not play the game, go to Sushi Ken.  I've eaten at about 15 sushi joints around here.  That's the go-to spot.",

We visited there this evening and ended up canceling our order and leaving, along with a few other tables. We waited almost an hour for our food that never came. We were told it was because the broth for our noodles needed time to cook as well as the meat for the fried rice. Ridiculous! When we received our check (finally) we were informed that the items we cancelled were removed from the check, as if it were a favor done for us. We will be looking for another weekly sushi restaurant.",

I've been here a handful of times and have had excellent service, save one visit. Everyone I bring here thoroughly enjoys it as well. Try the Vegas Rolls, but don't expect them to be the same as RA. They have a dark beer here straight from Japan, it's delicious. The cold sake menu is tasty as well. Takeout from here is a good deal too if you want to avoid the crowds.",

The best thing about this place is the delicious food at a great price.  I have been to a lot of places in the surrounding areas and I ALWAYS go back to Sakana.  Also they have a ton of daily specials and wait for it............. HALF SHELL OYSTERS!! Yummy! Ok now I'm hungry!",

I prefer to be seated on a regular table so that the conversation would be better. It's just odd that they don't have a table for 5 people. Brushing that off. The sushi is not bad and their ten spice salmon is pretty good. It took awhile for us to get our food after ordering. If not with friends, I'll be cranky as hell because of that wait time. Check-in so you can get the complimentary edamame! The servers are awesome. Friendly, funny and helpful. You also get free song and ice cream on your birthday!",

If you are looking for great food and great service this is the place to come, its like finding an oasis in the middle of a desert. You could go to one of the many run of the mill sushi joints around town but you would be missing out on what life truly has to offer.  As previous reviews have stated, there are excellent appetizer specials when you purchase a Japanese beer such as fried calamari, chicken yakitori, edemame and of course pot stickers (fried or steamed) for $1.  My favorite dinner item is the big eye tuna, they cut a piece right behind the cheek or gill of the fish and call it the big eye kama. The meat is extremely tender and ample, like having a steak except incredibly nutritious. The fish is served with a sweet sauce which is delicious and when eaten with Kirin Light it creates a perfect pair, just ask for it you will not be disappointed. Rolls are excellent as well, some of my favorites would be the Cajun wild fish roll or the crunchy eel roll. The sashimi is always made fresh and promptly, the shrimp, salmon and eel are some of the tasty items I enjoy.  The Bartender Wes keeps everyone quenched and always has positive energy. Management likes to interact with their guests to ensure satisfaction with all orders, which equals great customer service.   Thank you Jun, Taki and April.",

I grew up in Monterey Bay & was often able to enjoy sushi grade seafood right off the boat courtesy of my fishing family.  Sakana has impressed me since I moved to Phoenix in 1999. They always have impressively fresh fish. I highly recommend ordering from their specials board because it is usually the freshest & best quality fish being offered. Oh, and did I mention the portion sizes are ginormous compared to higher priced, lower quality Phoenix sushi joints?  Well, they are!  Also, don't be afraid to ask what the sushi chefs recommend, they've never steered me wrong.  For my 27th (again) birthday, my friends & family joined me for dinner at their teppanyaki tables. We got dinner & a show! Ramon, who takes great care of us at the sushi bar, was cooking that night and got all my guests into the action. Food was very good, but the ambiance made it excellent.  Jun, a manager, was also very accomodating when I invited my vegan friend to try sushi for the first time. Eee gads you say?!? Not so, Jun was able to have a batch of rice made without the benito flake seasoning, ordered us some fantastic veggie rolls using it, and added a great veggie tempura sans animal product.  My bottom line is this, if you want good quality sushi and excellent service & attention, then Sakana on Elliot is the place to go. Just leave two seats at the sushi bar open for my husband & me!!",

The service is excellent - our server came by often and was very friendly and accommodating; we ordered a few dishes to share, and she had them plated separately without us specifically requesting it.  My elderly uncle has trouble walking and balancing himself, so when we were helping him get seated, another server rushed over to help us.  Aside from that, the food portions and quality are simply amazing for the price - even the dishes that were split were more than sufficient for each person (namely, the large Chirashi entree and udon).  To boot, they have many items that are not on the menu, so ask about those!  I also thoroughly enjoyed their specialty margarita (generous with the alcohol), and appreciated the oldies and other retro tracks they were playing throughout the evening.

    "text": "Yeah man,...I don't really know all that much about sushi or sashimi.  The things I order are bastardized American versions of a long forgotten cuisine steeped in traditional intricacies and guided by the hand of custom.  But I don't mind.  I like it.  And when my wife wants to go out and have something nice, it really looks like I did my homework if (and when) I take her to sushi.  \"Oh my gosh, I love sushi.\"  Yeah baby, we're gonna wasabi this shizz up.    So it was Saturday and we were invited to a birthday party at a lounge where $250 dollar bottles of vodka were awaiting us in cozy confines of some random V.I.P. area where hundreds before us have made it rain on hostesses spilling out of their corsets while working that bottleservice.  What could be better than to segue into our night's exploits with a little sushi and where better than Sakana?  I'm not sure the answer to that question but since I live in Tempe this place was the ace up my sleeve.  We didn't want to get too full but we wanted to eat.  I was hungry but cautious.  So we ordered accordingly.  \"My wife will have the house martini and I'll just have water (ahem).  We'll have the Rainbow Roll, the Lobster Tempura Roll and the Gyoza appetizer.\"  The inside of Sakana is pretty dark at night and I like that aside from have to hold the menu closer to my face to read it.  Our waitress was competent enough to bring the food quickly but not enough to get my wife's drink order correct.  It's alright.    We were hungry and we ate and we didn't get too full but definitely were satisfied.  I know my wife won't let me pass this place up again.",

The servers checked on us once after we received our food. We literally waited more than  20 minutes to get the check and another ten to get my card back.   The rolls are so oversize and we did not even get a plate to put our rolls down. I am pretty sure most of these reviews are fake or these people have never had semi-decent sushi. The rolls were just a huge mess and fell apart if you tried to move them. Each bite of sushi here was equivalent of three bites of normal sushi. I was really excited because this place had such amazing reviews. I just wasted 40+ dollars on a terrible experience. I should have just gone to a supermarket or gas station, because at least they are honest about ripping me off.",

Our server was really helpful and had some great suggestions. We ended up trying the a specialty roll of the night and they were both super tasty!  I don't know about you, but I'm not one to try a new sushi place without a recommendation... so consider this as me recommending Sakana to you! :)",

We were seated immediately and our server brought our drinks and took our orders right away. I don't eat any meat or fish, so I ordered the firey edamame and a tofu appetizer with a couple veggie rolls. My husband got quite a few different kinds of sushi. My appetizers and about half of his sushi came out fairly fast and everything was delicious and good sized portions. Then we waited for about 35 minutes for the rest of our food. Our server even asked if we wanted dessert, then realized we were still waiting for our food. Finally my husband had to flag her down and tell her we were still waiting. He also had to ask for water and she didn't fill mine when she filled his and acted put out because mine was empty too. Good food, but very poor service.",

As a result, our server was running around frantically and messed up our order 3 times. I was forgiving under the circumstances until she gave us a rude attitude when we inquired about the appetizer orders she had clearly forgotten about. Yikes.   The sushi was surprisingly decent (see: edible) for the prices. My standards are a little high and cheap sushi always concerns me a little. The rolls seemed to sacrifice quality for quantity and they all more or less tasted the same. I think I might have actually gotten food poisoning but who knows (I definitely got sick later that night). I was invited as a guest so I didn't want to be impolite and refuse, but I probably wouldn't come back here again on my own volition.",

People serving alcohol need to be in compliance and need to know when someone has had enough to drink!!  I was there Sat to pick up a take out order. Place was busy . Bar wasn't so while I waited for my take out I decided to have a beer. Two guys at the bar were loud and using foul language. This place had lots of kids with their families so it's no place to have to listen to this. I observed the two guys who both had drinks in front of them. I was drunker then the other but neither should be getting in a car. By the way , having been in the restaurant business and having to watch people who were getting drunk it was very plain to see these guys needed no more.  I mentioned to the bartender that the AZ liquor license board could serve some serious violations as to why these guys were still being served. The bartender replied. She'd only served them one drink ! This may have been the case but I doubt it but all they need to do is get into a car and drive and get into an accident and it wouldn't matter if they'd only had one drink there or not. Usually the place that serves them last is the place that THEY end up suing. It's sad but that's the case.  The wait staff need major compliance and it's up to The Management to provide it.  I speak from experience as I've been in and around the restaurant business for 20 plus years and was hit head on in a traffic accident by someone leaving a bar in Phoenix. That person left the scene of the crime before the police arrived even though our two cars were left totaled.",

Usually a good server would tell you what on the plate when he or she bring it to the table.... Then a chef showed up to our table and admitted that Tamago was all out, however he insisted that he put Toro plate and made us pay for it. Because we did not want to make a scene so we did pay, but I was 100% sure it was never served. Because I know Exactly what Toro is and I immediately noticed it was not on our plate as soon as our plate was placed on our table. I guess I should have pointed out to the server then, but I thought Toro was coming later. When you go to Sakana, I urge you to make sure we are served everything you ordered.

    "text": "My wife and I have had some enjoyable meals here but I think this will be our last.    My salmon sushi was a strange warm temperature and rather pungent.  I only had one of the two pieces and no one inquired why.  The teriyaki chicken was so so, my wife enjoyed her calamari and seaweed salad.  Our waitress completely disappeared on us.  She never checked on our order nor refilled our drinks.  different waiter cashed us out while our waitress stood by the bar.  The worst part of the experience though was the music.  Several songs that included the f-word were played loudly (the f-word was bleeped out but it was still clear that it was part of the song) and the lyrics were sexually explicit and had racial elements that were offensive.  This was at 5pm.  The manager said he had recently switched to Pandora and may have to review his filters.  All in al it was a bad anniversary experience for us on a rare night out.",

We had to order these since my wife is pregnant. First, i was very surprised by the Las Vegas roll. It was really tasty and the price was cheap. The Salmon bomb was good except the spicy sauce was not my favorite. The biggest surprise was the mixed tempura which were freshly fried and fried shrimp were sooooo good. Thumbs up!!!",

    "text": "Went Sunday night with my boyfriend and his mom. It was my first time and my last. We waited for about 15 minutes to be seated but they were busy so i understand. However the hostess was extremely rude and couldn't keep track of who was next even when she wrote it down.  We she tried to skip us and seat other people who got there after us, we had to tell her that we had been waiting. And she responded by telling us \"You don't need to get mad\", no one was mad she just wasn't doing her job and got called out for it. Next we were seated and took about 15 minutes for our waitress to come and order our food. When we asked her questions about the menu she would give us short answers and seemed rushed. It took about 20+ minutes for our food to come out and people who were seated after us received their food and were done by time we got ours. When we finally got our food we weren't given any napkins, chopsticks or any kind of silverware. And to top it off our rolls were falling apart, so it wasn't an enjoyable experience at all. I'm not sure if this it how it is just on Sunday's but i won't be coming back to find out. For anyone who is looking to eat here, don't. Go to Ra off ray or another sushi place. This was suppose to be a nice dinner and it was completely ruined from start to finish. Don't waste your time or money here.",

You can get the sake bomb for a cheaper price too if you get it w/ the beer.  I didn't; my cousin did.  For each beer bought, we could buy an appetizer dish from the options listed.  We got the calamari, the dish w/ jalapeno and zucchini and batter I think I forgot the name, the spicy tuna roll, and shrimp tempura roll.  All of these were good.  Most of these were split among 3 people; we got full fast and walked out of there buzzed.",

Such as, California rolls, tempera rolls, and Las Vegas are good, but they are extremely basic. They have lunch specials, like the poke bowl, that are fairly priced and a good amount. Billy our sushi chef was very helpful.   I would recommend the teppanyaki for large parties...and sushi bar for couples.  It does get busy- go early!  The only downside is the entrance/waiting area to be seated, because the design is not smart. It gets extremely packed. When people are entering/leaving they cannot get out, because everyone is waiting to be sat. A redesign is NEEDED.   Beside that, it is the best local Arizona sushi place around.",

    "text": "So their tagline is Friendly Staff. Generous Portions. Quality Food and I think they really did a good job of that.   Staff - everyone seemed to enjoy their jobs from wait staff to the chefs to even the owner. We sat at the sushi bar and they toasted us any any new arrivers up as a welcome to the bar acknowledgement.   Service - I redeemed my check-in offer with a smile...had enough attention and plates were cleared away quickly to ensure we had room for more goodness coming out.  Quality Food - The rolls were unique and plentiful. Someone mentioned order light and work your way up to new rolls and that is so True. And the prices to quality and portions is surreal. I would only get half of that for more in Chicago. We had the Smokey Bear (Shrimp Tempura, Smoked Salmon, Habanero Sauce) and the Crazy Roller Coaster Roll (Tuna, Yellow Tail, and some other goodness). You didn't feel heavy after eating them.   You can pass on the edamame.. it seem undercooked and packed with table salt.  Lastly and most importantly, don't judge this place by the cover. It's probably more on the divey side of things or just random placements, but the food doesn't disappoint.",

My motto used to be all teppanyaki is good, after my dining experience here I am forced to alter that saying. Everything that came off the grill was horrible. They messed up the fried rice, how do you mess up fried rice? It had a funky flavor that began to permeate through every other piece of food that was delivered. The rib-eye was extremely fatty, essentially like gum. The scallops were overcooked and went uneaten. The veggies were forgotten until the end by our chef and once complete burned and inedible.  My advice to you, go to Benihana, go to Arby's, go anywhere else except here. It's the worst of the worst.",

I went and sat on one of the end chairs because my legs were hurting and she VERY rudely said \"I'm gonna need a minute to finish\" MY BLOOD PRESSURE WENT UP LIKE CRAZY and I answered back \"you don't have to be rude about it.\" I hate bad customer service, it's my biggest pet peeve. She was the WORST I've seen in the service industry ever. No wonder she's just a hostess and not a server, she would never get tips.

Salmon dynamite is good as well. Always something new, though the \"crab with a K\" in everything is a little disappointing but it's usually out shined by great toppings.   The miso soup and iced green tea are good and you can't go wrong with a sake-bomber!!",

They have the freshest fish in town, decent prices, and really good service. They even have the grills to do it up Japanese steak house style.  Try the mahi mahi tempura roll, it's my favorite. The baked scallops roll is phenomenal too. I definitely suggest sitting at the sushi bar the first time there, the cooks are really entertaining and a lot of fun.   Also, if you're a big beer fan, this place has asahi black, which I normally can't find at many restaurants.",

I walked in, towards the hostess stand, past 2 small parties in the waiting area.  I saw most of the tables full, and 3 empty seats at the sushi bar...one at each end and one in the middle.  An employee greeted me and I said, \"Just one, please\".  Before he could reply, a lady from one of the parties said loudly, \"THERE'S A WAIT FOR THE SUSHI BAR\".  The employee said, \"I'm sorry, those three people want the sushi bar\".  I replied, \"There  are 3 seats at the sushi bar\" and the lady said loudly, \"BUT THE'RE NOT TOGETHER\".  I said to the employee, \"All I would like is one of those empty seats\" and he said, \"I'm sorry, she already complained because I sat a person before her.\"  I asked, \"Are you the manager?\"  He said, \"I'm Ray, the owner\".  I couldn't believe HE SAID HE WAS THE OWNER...running his own business this way..!!!  He didn't estimate a time for me to be seated, didn't offer a glass of water while I wait, and DIDN'T EVEN OFFER to write my name on a waiting list.  I asked, \"Ray, I come in here all the time...are you turning away my business?\"  He said, \"I'm sorry, Sir\", broke eye contact with me and instead spoke with 2 people who had just walked in behind me..!!!  I regained Ray's eye contact and said, \"Ray, this is really bad, and I'm not going to forget this\".  I TURNED AND WALKED OUT...it was the most ridiculous and upsetting situation I've ever encountered in any restaurant, anywhere.  I drove to SUSHI KEN on Chandler Blvd in Ahwatukee, where I had a very enjoyable lunch, from people who understand hospitality.  Afterwards, I glanced at some of Sakana's 1 star YELP reviews and now can relate to the BAD EXPERIENCES of the other customers.",

    "text": "Now here's a really shining example of what turns me on in a restaurant. First off, love the subject matter: I love sushi. Second, go with next to no expectations because the only reason you're going there is because it happens to be close to work, and you can't remember the name or location of that other sushi place your buddy took you to that was really awesome but what's its name again? Oh heck, I can't remember, let's just go to that Sakana joint across the street. Third: realize, with joy and shock that you are being served very competent sushi at reasonable prices by pleasant people.   When you walk in the door, they wisely set out example plates of the $10 lunch specials. One is a teriyaki/tempura-leaning set for the fish-challenged, the other a typical - if generous - sushi set featuring various popular cuts of fish coupled with California rolls (k-rab, but what can you expect?). I'm not kidding when I say generous. There were six noori sushi rolls, two california-style rolls, each about six pieces and one tempura roll - eel I think, definitely sweet. To get this amount of food for ten bucks would be enough, but add a nice little asian green salad and miso soup, and you're talking more food than you can actually be reasonably expected to get through in a single setting.   I'm certain that they pre-make the lunch set, but the fish was as fresh and delicious as one could be expected to find in a place whose annual rainfall is about seven inches (I'm sorry, I can't help myself). The help was swift, the service was swift and the atmosphere was very relaxed. Everyone was pleasantly surprised at what a great little place we'd found so close to work. Can't recommend this one enough. Cheers!",

However, this last time I have to say I was really unimpressed.  One tradition I know from Japanese culture is that its considered amazingly rude to eat before the other members of your party. Mind you, this is not totally your fault if your food comes out 20 MINUTES before your date's, but none the less, its bad karma.  The service here was HORRIBLE. Our food came out 20 minutes apart for our entrees. The girls serving were way more interested in chatting with their friends then they were in doing their jobs.   I get it, you're 18, its important to sit and gab with your friends.  BUT NOT ON MY TIME! Do your goddamn job. I was mortified that my girl tipped on the check. Normally I just write \"learn to do your job and tips will come\" or \"tips are: To Insure Proper Service\" but I think she felt bad.  I won't be going back any time soon. I'm all for jailbait eyecandy, but I'd much rather get my food brought out at the right time...",

There is not a huge air of pretension surrounding this place. And it is definitely not trying to \"keep up with the Joneses.\" This is EXACTLY why I love this place!",

    "text": "I have been going to Sakana for years and years. I've been here for the best of times (hour long waits) I've been here for the worst of times (teppan tables that set fire to you). I've seen the amazing bang-for-buck quality degrade (shortly after those best-of-times) and then slowly return. Now they seem to have settled into a nice even groove.  This isn't the best sushi you will find. But you will get about 90% of the way there for about 50% of the price...and that's why I come back time and again.  1) Try the special habenero sauce. It's AMAZING. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. Especially good on yellow tail sashimi. OMGWTFBBQ so good. Seriously. Bottle it and ship it to me in SF please!  2) The Chirashi lunch special is the best I've seen anywhere, and I mean ANYWHERE. I travel a lot for work, and I have never seen such a great lunch special, let alone for sushi. For several years I worked down the street...I never felt a diminishing return and never stopped looking forward to my lunch special.  3) The portions are ENORMOUS. Maybe you won't be blown away if you haven't had sushi around the country, but compared to restaurants here in San Francisco? Sakana's price-per-pound on their rolls and sashimi is more like 25-30% of what I see on a regular basis.  So if you are a sushi lover like I'm a sushi lover, you will enjoy this place a lot and will feel great about the savings. However, if you want to take a client out someplace nice, or a date, or simply want the best sushi in town, I would recommend Shimogamo out in Chandler, or one of the other high end spots.  Sakana is a sushi bar for people who like to eat sushi all the time, but don't have a millon in the bank...or maybe even for those who do have a million in the bank but want to keep it there.  Enjoy.",

For starters try their spring rolls, crunchy and delicious! Their sashimi melts in your mouth. Like budda, baby. I normally get salmon and yellowtail. Good stuff.  I have never had a roll here that I didn't like. If it looks like it will be good when you order it...it'll be even better on the plate.  Try 'em all.  \r \r After 6:00 or so on the weekends, look for hour waits. But it will be worth it.

    "text": "Service: Seated promptly in the booth section but was left along with several other patrons at different booths to find our own service after waiting over 4 minutes. Once we got the attention of a server, we placed our order for the lunch special rolls. Even though this place was very busy (~12:30pm with lots of business lunch patrons), you could watch as some servers stood around not doing anything. Rolls came out at a reasonable pace but we weren't even given a small plate to eat each piece off of and had to eat over our roll plates. We were only checked on once (not by our original server) and that was because she was resting her elbow on the booth section divider and casually asked us if everything was good. When we were done eating we waited for at least 5 minutes to see if they would bring a check, then we started making eye contact with servers hoping they would get the point but they would continue with whatever they were doing. We had to flag someone down to get our check. Unacceptable level of service from start to finish.  Food: You could tell how they could offer such good deals on their lunch special rolls when they overload the rolls with rice and fake crab/mayo (I have no problem with either ingredient, but they pack the rolls with it to the point where many different rolls tasted very similar because they were so dominant with the fake crab mix). Each piece was extremely large and cumbersome to eat, often falling apart before you can find a way to fit it in your mouth. The rolls weren't even in the shape of a circle, but more like a rounded triangle. The sushi chefs were either rushed, new, or incompetent. I'm also suspicious that the spicy tuna uses canned tuna as filler along with chunks of real tuna. I'll let you decide if that's acceptable for sushi.  Ambiance: It's ok. You won't pay attention to it when you're trying to get a servers attention.",

If you are like I was, you might be carrying an unfair bias toward seafood prepared so far away from the sea. Sakana is WONDERFUL and very reasonably priced! Get the Baked Scallops sushi. It is DELICIOUS! The Mango Saketini's are very very good. The age-dashi tofu is yummy.  This location of Sakana is especially good to party in. It really gets rollicking and is a little bit loud. If you are in the mood for a more elegant subdued experience, I suggest the other location of Sakana in Scottsdale. This place is a party and you might have to yell to your date.",

Good selection of items on the menu and pricing is average, but the food was underwhelming. Most of my rolls were poorly done and fell apart either when it was plated or when I picked it up with my chop sticks. Fish and rolls were flavorless- did not seem like good quality sushi at all. Seaweed salad too chewy to eat. Waitress never checked in after food was delivered until we were long done and/or over it. I ordered a green tea ice cream (as I was still hungry after not eating most of my meal) - and the ice cream was freezer-burned and tasted like dirt, there were also weird white chunks in the ice cream- not sure if that was more freeze burn or an unmixed ice cream ingredient, but it was unappetizing.

It's literally around the block, and we couldn't be happier.   My SILs are all about the Happy Hour specials, which are quite good. I'm more of a sashimi and occasional nigiri kinda gal, so I usually offer a la carte from the special board. The lunch specials are reasonably priced, and service easily gets you in and out quickly enough to cover a break.   Fish quality is good to excellent on some of the specials, they don't have uni or live items, but high grade fish is available. Rolls seem to please the yum yum sauce crowd, too. They have Teppan tables which have to be reserved, and we are definitely going to try that soon, Scott loves it!   Yelp check in yields free edamame. The joint seems to be jumping nightly, and we are jazzed to have them in the hood.",

I can make a direct comparison to ramen bars in which I've had exceptional ramen. This place doesn't even come close to measuring up.  One of our rolls never made it to the table and was forgotten. The California roll was acceptable but not great. The Ahi Ahi specialty roll did not come as ordered. It overall had a fishy taste to it which would not indicate freshness. After one bite we sent it back.  Service: Also quite bad. The place was very busy on this Friday nite but that is never an excuse to provide bad service. Our app never came along with one of the rolls. The one of the two rolls that made it was incorrect.   Our server kept stopping on the way to attend to other tables but overall neglected our needs. She said she was getting the manager but never did. I had to flag the manager down myself to explain what occurred.   Overall: I have been to many different Japanese restaurants over the years from coast to coast. Some were exceptional and some were disgraceful. This place definitely ranks amongst the bottom in terms of food quality and service. Furthermore, the prices were above the norm with quality that does not measure up.  I certainly would not return.",

    "text": "So, my husband and I went there and we were seated at the bar. We've never sat at the bar before and wasn't sure if the sushi chef was our waiter or not because we sat there for quite a bit, with no service. Well I wanted to ask if there was something specific, something called Chirashi, on their menu so I waited for the waiter, while my husband found what he wanted on the sushi menu and gave it to the sushi chef.   Well finally, the waiter came, we ordered our water, and appetizer and I ask my question. (By this time my husband has already gotten his rolls and was chowing down) The waiter had to ask someone, which is fair, but he forgot our appetizer order, which became quite apparent 10 minutes later and he asked me what I had ordered.   Meanwhile, I ordered the Chirashi with the sushi chef and he did and AMAZING job. It is SOOOOO DELICIOUS.  Seriously, anyone reading this if you like sashimi, order the Chirashi. It is a fraction of the price of when you just order sashimi, and it is essentially sashimi on rice with some other good stuff.   I'm giving my review a 3 simply because of the waiter's service. The food was great.",

In fact, after my first visit I was hooked, and have had the pleasure of visiting countless times.   I'll keep it very simple and provide you the order to end all orders. Why is Sakana better than any other affordable sushi option? Quantity, quality, price...amazing service is the cherry on top. Instead of being subjective I'll focus on a more objective view. Here's what I order EVERY time with my girlfriend:  Drinks $14: Large Kirin and sake x2  Appetizers $2 ($1 each with Kirin purchase!):  Jalaccini (fried zucchini and jalapeno) Fried mushrooms (best you'll ever have) Both come with \"miso mayo\" the greatest sauce I've ever tasted!  Sushi $7.65:  Spicy tuna roll (the biggest roll you will find, bar none. I kid you. not, these things are stuffed full of tuna)  Mexican Caliente roll (jalapeno goodness, just as gigantic as the spicy tuna!)  Grand total for 2 sake bombs, 2 apps, and 2 giant rolls:   $23.65 + $5 tip  This is the best of the best, and for a price that can't be beat. Oh and here's a bonus: they have gluten free soy sauce!   Other tips: ask for the happy hour cocktail menu, they don't have it out, but most of the drinks are incredible and affordable.",

Once I went in there and asked for an itemized check, it took them 25 minutes to bring the check back AND it still wasnt itemized. In fact, I still don't know what it was. I love their sushi but its about time for me to find a new sushi restaurant after how many times I've had waitresses be rude and even ignore me.   Their redeeming quality that kept me coming back so long was their happy hour prices Sunday-Thursday. Its a lot of sushi for a small cost.

I liked the light tempura batter, and the fry on the calamari and accompanying jalapenos was good. We also had the edamame, which were a little undergone to me. Still, everything was such a great price that you can't complain too much.  The Sakana lunch special is a really good value - big plate of sushi and rolls for $10. A friend and I split this, along with 2 additional rolls. The fish portions were good, and I thought the rolls were very fair for the price. Alaska roll was nice, as was the Mexican caliente roll.  Portions were generous, so we weren't able to finish everything even after indulging ourselves into a food coma. For the lunch prices, I think Sakana was good.

We thought dinner would be better, a lot of sushi places don't exactly shine for lunch.  We judge a place based on the nigiri.  It just wasn't that... great... it wasn't that fresh, wasn't that flavorful.. just not up to par at all.  We took people there for a business meeting and the people that are just used to tempura and California rolls seemed happy.   Basically.. cheap rolls and tempura.. okay for lunch. If you are a sushi snob, find somewhere that showcases the fish more.  Oh! And this place plays 90's pop music loudly.  Weird.",

Our waitress, although thorough and attentive, made me feel really rushed. The 50 cent appetizer deal is awesome, and the fried scallops are great! (I love all things fried--their 50 cent appetizer menu is awesome for other fried food fanatics). The sushi tasted pretty good, but felt a bit soggy and fell apart. The teppanyaki steak was absolutely delicious, but the chef did not do any tricks or anything interesting. He just chopped up our food, cooked it, and calmly placed it on our plates. I'm used to flames and excitement when I go to a teppanyaki place. Their birthday song is pretty funny--a loud drum, a Japanese birthday song, ice cream, and a Good Fortune cat are enough to embarass almost anyone! All in all, decent food but mediocre service. I'll probably do take out if I bother with this place again.",

In fact, we would call it one of our \"go-to\" places. Over the last 6 months or so however, that has changed and as of today, I will not go back. Craving fresh sashimi and being consistently disappointed has not been good for my loyalty nor my pocket book. Today, my son and I tried yet again, wanting to give Sakana another chance. Today the albacore was fishy and mushy, some of the other fish was \"borderline\" and my cucumber roll lacked any substance or finesse.We were told nothing would be done in terms of compensation (i.e. taking something off the tab) because we did not inform them in enough time. Poor quality food, poor service...big bummer.",

My boyfriend and I are always on the hunt for good sushi places and were thrilled when we stumbled upon this place!   The location was a bit difficult to find and park at when it's busy. The atmosphere is quaint but cozy. We typically sit at the sushi bar where service is great.  The rolls are unusually large (it takes me two bites to finish just one piece!) and the price for these rolls are inexpensive. I recommend the philidelphia roll. The salmon is always abundant and you can taste the smokiness.  In comparison to the chain Ra Sushi, Sakana's rolls are fresher, larger, and cheaper.   Best. Sushi. Ever!",

The place was lively and the sushi that kept passing by me looked amazing!  There were some pretty good deals for happy hour including appetizers for 50 cents with the purchase of a Kirin.  We ordered a few rolls including the Miami roll which was one of their special rolls of the evening.  The rolls were ok, standard fancy pants rolls.  I guess for my personal taste with sushi, less is more.....I tend to appreciate the more simple sushi in which the taste of the fish itself really shines.  For this reason, I really enjoyed their yellowtail sashimi above all else.  The presentation of everything was very nice and the sushi chefs made the ambiance very fun and authentic as they took shots with some sushi bar diners.  I would definitely visit Sakana again, especially for their sashimi.",

    "text": "This used to be my favorite place when I lived in the Greater Phoenix metro 5 years ago.  I have revisited Sakana on a business trip and now I am wondering if this is the same Sakana that I used to frequent... To start with, the kind of sushi is certainly not the traditional sushi that you usually see in real Japanese restaurants. Real traditional Japanese restaurants offer smaller, well-cut and well-wrapped pieces  with a small amount of rice and high quality fish meat.  If I remember correctly the sushi in Sakana used to be like that 4-5 years ago.   Now the current Sakana offers huge slices of fish meat and huge amount of fish eggs but they may easily fall apart.   The quality and freshness are also mediocre at best, or to be more exact, close to the quality you find in all you can eat restaurants like Todai, Minado...,etc. The rainbow roll that used to wow me is still the same price...but I am not sure if it is the same quality. The interior is certainly getting old and the carpet is really worn out.  All of which make it less and less attractive.  The best dish I had was the clam miso soup, but the sushi was really disappointing.  If you want \"volume\" at a more affordable price, I would recommend Todai or even Pacific. If you want \"real\" traditional Japanese sushi at an affordable price, I recommend Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale.  If you have a good amount of money to spend, you might as well spend it at Sushi On Shea, though you are really paying more for the atmosphere... I am sad to say that I would  not come back to Sakana again...This is definitely not the Sakana in my memory.",

Closest to the resort with an atmosphere we figured we wanted was Sakana.  We ordered way too much food, but it was all very tasty.  Berkeley is a foodie haven, and we are admittedly food snobs.  Sakana was good stuff, and we'd recommend that you give it a try.",

I have had some other good sushi.... but this was the best priced and the best portions for your money.... if you like sushi (sashimi in particular) check this place out. I have also tried their 7-spice.. or 10-spice Salmon with spicy mayo sauce.... delicious!",

California Rolls and Alaska Rolls also on this trip.. Very good, and FRESH...  Wife - Teriyaki Chicken,, very good even though all places only sell breast meat on chicken entrees... Portion size was huge comparative to the lunch pricing..  I had the Calamari Jalapeno salad,, lots of Calamari, seriously was more Calamari than salad,, the dressing is unique and matches very well to the dish.  Iced Tea was definitely not china mist or nestle, or lipton,   very good also.  2 appetizers with beer, and 2 full entree's for about 30 bucks out the door.. simply great.... Will definitely be back,, often  Thanks!!",

I always go with family who are regulars and they always do the ordering.  Let me just say, I've never had a bad roll there, though!  Some are very different - but so incredibly tasty!  Seriously, if you like sushi - go here!  Remember, the place is nothing fancy!  But the food is GREAT.  I've done the teppanyaki here, as well.

I was told it was the best sushi in the valley, but the fish wasn't quite the right temperature, and the rice didn't have that subtle sweetness I look for.

The boyfriend got the sashimi lunch special which was a good price but tasted pretty average. The last dish we ordered was the baked scallop roll which took foorrever to come out. I wish I could say it was worth the wait but again not much flavor. I recommend they give  a warning on the wait time for that dish.

Everytime we come we receive our sushi before our apps and end up with a super full table. The ramen bowl we ordered ended up out before our calamari and super mussels (both delicious!). It was truly all very good, the Philly roll had awesome salmon and the roly poly roll had amazing eel sauce. Having the half off apps with the large sake bombs? Brilliant. The only thing that's keeping the 4th star out is pacing of the food. This may sound hoity-toity, but timing does matter. Especially with meals like sushi, you gotta build or you end up taking half your rolls home. The servers were also very nice, the food runners too, I think it's just a communication kink.",

The jackpot roll - which is a MUST have if you love Las Vegas rolls, you will love this roll. Its a Las vegas roll on the bottom (house smoked salmon, avocado and cream cheese roll thats tempura fried and it has spicy tuna on top with a miso mayo and eel sauce dressing. yum!  3. The dragon roll - will have you leaving full.  I do order Mochi sometimes, but it's really just from Trader Joe's so I would just buy it from there. Lol. But overall, great place for sushi, teppan, and sake.  Note: I really love the waitress Toon! She's served me and my family a couple times and she's so sweet and prompt!",

If you sit at the sushi bar they will hand you fresh wasabi which is neat especially if you haven't had it before. Sakana is a little more expensive than some sushi places but a few more dollars will get you good quality it is totally worth it.",

Friendly service and wonderful specials.  I recommend stopping in for lunch and enjoying the Sakana Lunch Special. Comes with me so soup and a ginger salad; it is my favorite sushi lunch in the valley.  Actually frequent all of the locations; however, each location has a different spin on the Sakana lunch.  If going for dinner, be sure to check out their Salmon Bomber roll; It is peerless.",

    "text": "The reason I'm giving this place two stars is the combination of lackluster and slow service from our server George. A super nice guy and I really hope this was just a fluke, but going so long in between checking on us, drink delivery after we had already eaten half of our food, appetizer coming shortly after the delayed drink delivery, I'm wondering what really went wrong. On top of that it took about twenty minutes just to get cashed out. We had some hiccups in what we were charged which is understandable, we originally wrote something in then crossed it out to pick other items instead, but it took another ten or so just to remedy the wrong items and cash out for the appropriate ones. I could honestly overlook that but because the service was painstakingly slow, inattentive and just kinda poor overall it made it hard for me to be understanding. Meanwhile the guests next to us were waited on attentively by another server.   I really love Sakana and this won't deter us from coming back, but as another restaurant professional I made every excuse for this until it just became too much.   The saving grace though, was Steven. And the other sushi chefs (Hong?) and one other young guy. Steven was probably the best part of our meal aside from the food itself. Quick, personable, funny, and incredibly accommodating with super sharp hearing and even sharper knives. I can honestly say we'll be back way more often just for him. I cannot say enough nice things about Steven and that whole sushi bar deserves endless praise. Thank you guys! You were amazing!!!",

    "text": "Sometimes, when you are in the midst of conversation and start sharing places to dine among friends and you get recommendations to try this place - \"you'll like it! \"Too me, sometimes word of mouth and even reading reviews whether it be on Yelp/google/trip advisor/through a friend and etc it is totally a \"Hit and Miss\". I must say Sakana Sushi & Grill has very friendly customer service and our waitress was very gracious. However, their dishes we had were a disappointment being that it was recommended to come and check this place out.  We ordered the calamari, baked super mussels, baked scallop rolls, and their spicy & regular tonkatsu ramen. Calamari was okay - it wasn't anything that was a WOW factor - the batter was tasty, both the baked super mussels and scallop rolls was stuffed with a mountain of mayo/imitation crab and usually it is supposed to be marinated with mayo/sirracha/masago/green onions - baked/flared on the top...Yahhh, it wasn't nothing near to that and same thing with the scallop rolls...I felt they put a lot of the imitation crab/mayo as a filler/Scallops are definitely from frozen food packets you can pick up at the store - you can tell what kind of scallops they use because it's not fresh/semi-fresh at all but, solid hard when biting into it or it just could be how people in the community like to eat their sushi - not authentic but, I am not entirely sure! Because it was a packed house tonight The tonkatsu ramen was meh - Broth was good, but the cha siu (pork meat) was ALL FAT and very tiny bites of little meat on it - maybe like 2 tiny pieces I found and the rest I just threw it out on the side.  I think the waitress knew I was disappointed in their food tonight because she saw me scraping all of the imitation crab to the side, trying to find these scallops and eating my roll, she also saw my cha-siu fat on the side as well.  It was a \"miss\", will I come back again! I don't think so...It was a one time deal for us.",

Yes they do have quite a variety of sushi. However in comparison to places you'd find in Hawaii or California, the flavor does not quite compare.  We are probably not likely to return. Not because it was bad, but just because it's not quite what we're looking for.  With that said, we've heard a number of people rave about this place, which is why went to check it. So give it a shot and see what you think.",

It came with not enough broth to cover the noodles and the noodles were....from a package?  Ever buy ramen at the Asian market and the noodles are in a baggie, all clumped together?  Well that's what these noodles were.  And parts weren't even \"unclumped\".    I mean...you just....you just can't do that.  That being said....it was freaking amazing.  I don't know how they pulled it off, but they did.  It came with pork that was hands down the most flavorful pork I've ever had in ramen.  It had a kind of seared taste to it that spread into the broth and just made a wonderful flavor overall.  By the time I was done I was over the noodle part of it (but, damn).  Easily the best tasting, worst looking ramen I've ever had.  The miso soup was just OK, too salty for my tastes.  It's a nice place to visit.  They had families around the grill where they have chefs to cook in front of you.  There's a bar, and it's quiet and dark enough for a date but social enough for just hanging out with friends.  Easy to find, good parking, friendly staff.  I'll probably give the ramen another order and ask for some extra soup.",

Some had never been to a sushi type place where you place your order on little menus, like my kids and husband.  Portions are small, which was good so that you could try a variety of things.  We were aware of the no wasting food and I'm in agreement with this.  Some of the sushi rolls are a little smaller than you would get at regular sushi places, but that's fine because we were doing All You Can Eat Sushi Dinner.  At our table, all adults, we ordered a variety of specialty sushi rolls of which I forget what all different ones they were, but they were good.  The reason for the 4 star instead of 5 stars is because I've had much better sushi before.  It's not bad.  The service was great.  Kept refilling our waters regularly as getting what we needed.  They were nice, but not overly.  My mom liked that they were Chinese.  She's not big into Japanese food, but if the people that own it or work there are Chinese, this wins lots of points with her.  This is a little further than I would normally want to drive, but at the time we went, it wasn't crowded.  Would I come back?  Possibly.  No real complaints.",

We were not sure what to expect, but we were looking for a nice inauspicious place that had a good, calm mood and respectful patrons. This is not the place.   The atmosphere left much to be desired. 'Dive' is a really good way to describe it. It was noisy, the lighting was very dim, the menu's were floppy & faded, as tho they'd been washed one too many times, the floor is a copious amount of what looks to have once been blue carpet, now stained and faded. In addition, you have the TV's over the drink bar and sushi bar which does little to add to any ambiance besides a sports bar feel. It was loud, like everyone was talking at once and didn't care who overheard them. It is a sports bar sushi restaurant.   The rolls were... Meh. They were generously sized, but that was a bit of a turn off. It's hard to enjoy the flavor of the roll when your entire mouth is busy focusing on chewing so that you don't choke. If you took 2 bites of the large pieces, they were messy and fell apart as expected.   We ordered 4 rolls:  - Philadelphia - Mexican Caliente  - Las Vegas - Blood Orange  The only one we really liked was the Blood Orange, and it was the most expensive roll of course.   We also ordered ice tea & Perrier. Kinda hard to mess those up.   The staff was very friendly. No complaints there. A gentleman walked around asking how we enjoyed our meal. That was nice.   Overall, however, we don't plan on returning. We appreciated the great service, but the food and atmosphere is enough to keep us from coming back. We like our quiet dinner date nights, and this experience did nothing for that.   (Side note: as we were leaving, a couple came in with a small child and was sat directly next to us. The child was given chopsticks by the man that he promptly used as drumsticks on the nearest plate for long periods of time before he was moved to sit between the adults and his new 'toy' taken away. Again, didn't add to the dining experience. Not the fault of the restaurant, but that was our experience in a nutshell.)",

The sashimi plate has 3 pieces of salmon, tuna, albacore, and maybe snapper. They are pretty thick cut and tasted fresh and moist, not chewy. Scored!  After I finished my lunch within 10 minutes. My waitress was no where to be found. I sat for another 10 minutes before she can give me a check. I probablly will not come here if I am in a rush",

I always got to order the fried shrimp heads and of course my octopus with some lemon zest is a plus.  I can't rate this place an \"out of this world\" experience, but if you need your sushi fix I would recommend this place.  Overall the sushi is good, but the rolls could be tighter.   I think their drinks and appetizer combination special is a great idea and I totally dig it; buy a drink and get an appetizer for $1 -- Cool!    Ambience is chill and a night bar feel.  Decors are erratic and I don't know what to say about them. Service is good and the birthday song in Japanese is always a delight and welcomed.  I want to hold the lucky cat! - Enjoy!",

I love this place: full bar, teppanyaki, and my favorite sushi that will not be named for fear that they will run out of it.   The rolls are pretty awesome too.  I am a Las Vegas obsessor and it was not my favorite (too much roll, not enough cream cheese), neither was the Smokey Bear (delicate flavors, but I wasn't in the mood for that).  The Blood Orange Roll was heaven (and unlike anything I've ever had).  Then there was something with the Habanero sauce that I DID NOT like, but my boyfriend loved.  The Habanero sauce is all the heat and not a lot of flavor, but I'm less interested in super spicy.  I now know to not order stuff with Habanero sauce.  I gave it 5 stars because nothing was BAD, but was just did not fit my flavor needs. Everything was super fresh and awesome in terms of portions.",

For the more specialty rolls they were able to make imitation crab taste amazing which is pretty difficult to do. Ginger was very fresh and you could taste the difference. As for presentation and cut, my tuna roll was very unevenly shaped and looked like a dog chewed through it which was surprising because the other dishes looked great. One of the specialty tempura rolls was HUGE on both ends like 1.75x of a regular piece so it came apart when I picked it up (and i was careful) but falling apart sushi is one of my pet peeves so that did not sit well with me. Price cannot be beat!  Overall though a great experience. Free miso soup when you sit down too.",

    "text": "We sat at the bar and waited for our 7:30 teppan table reservation while drinking a warm (not hot) sake.  We were seated and I requested an extra hot sake.  Several minutes later still no sake- so again I asked our server who came to check on us for an extra hot sake.  A minute later we received another warm sake.  The standard ginger-dressed salad was decent and also the miso soup but nothing to write home about.  I ordered salmon \"rare, just seared\" and my companion ordered the New York steak \"medium rare\".  Our chef Jose' did his thing and was ok... somewhat funny but not a good or impressive performance by any means.  When he put my salmon on the teppan table, I reminded him \"rare, just seared\" because it was a nice piece but thin and I knew it would sear within seconds.  30 seconds after it was seared and now overcooked, I asked him politely to please remove it.  He doused it with something, waited 10 seconds, doused it with something else and waited another 10 seconds before serving it to me, at which point it was beyond well done.  Ditto for my companions NY steak- VERY, very chewy, tough and well done.  Flavor was good but horribly overcooked.  I won't go back there!  For reference, I have eaten at 25-30 different teppan restaurants all over the country and several in the Phoenix area. The sushi looked good and fresh, but we didn't have any.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place, at first. I had high hopes, mostly because the reviews were good. However, in a nutshell, service is shoddy.  I was in a group of four in total - my boyfriend, myself, and his two roommates. We arrived at a particularly busy time (7:30 PM on Sunday Night, which doesn't sound like a busy time). There was a bit of a wait as they cleaned up a booth for us - however they left some things on the floor, a napkin and some crumbs on the seat - so it wasn't really as clean as I would have liked. That's just me being critical though.  Anyway, on to the actual food and service.  The menu was strange, and was pretty barren. There were only two ramen options, two udon options, and four miso soup options. Entrees were mostly tempura too. There wasn't a lot to choose from if you didn't want an appetizer or sushi.   I ordered a bowl of miso, a cucumber roll, an avocado roll, and a rainbow roll. My boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki. One roommate ordered the udon, while the other ordered the ramen.  My miso came out first, and fairly speedily. It was absolutely delicious, although I was disappointed there wasn't any tofu - however that's silly of me considering I didn't order the tofu miso. It was delicious regardless. I loved it.  Then was the waiting. The udon came out second, after around 15 or 20 minutes. Then came the chicken teriyaki, which was another 5 or so minutes - the udon was already half gone at that point.  Then, ten minutes later, came the ramen. The udon was nearly gone. The chicken teriyaki would have been too, but my boyfriend was eating slowly and very little as a sort of respect thing for me, since I had been waiting for my sushi for what seemed like forever.  Finally, after what felt like forever, my cucumber and avocado rolls came out. I will admit that they were to die for, although a little tiny bit salty. I don't mind saltiness though! I ate most of those before my rainbow roll came out. The rainbow roll wasn't actually that great - the crab mix inside tasted too sweet, and they used way too much.  The rolls themselves were fairly big and hefty, and I got full from the cucumber and avocado, and half the rainbow roll. I was really pleased with the first two, but that rainbow roll was a little \"bleh.\" I was actually really surprised at how the avocado tasted - it was firm, creamy, cool and very, very yummy.  Throughout the night, there was in total of 4 waitresses waiting on us. It was very busy, which I completely understand, but I would have expected food to come out together rather than all separate. I had also heard complaints from my group on how dim the lighting was. \"We aren't vampires\" was a good comment.  All in all, the food itself was very good (aside from that crab salad filling, but it might be good for other people), but the service was spotty and spread out, and it was noisy, busy, dim and not as clean as I would have liked. Me and my boyfriend's check came out to be around $40, which sounds a little steep to me, but drinks weren't included.  I don't recommend this place, and I don't plan on going back, but I do commend them for their cucumber rolls.",

It would also be helpful once they seat you toexplain the papers they give you with the sushi. We waited a good 5-7 minutes for our waitress to come back so we could ask her a question.  The actual sushi was good though. The meat was very fresh and had amazing color (wish I took some pictures). The individual pieces were a little big though- especially the ends, which made it difficult to eat in one bite.  Overall a good sushi place- just don't go there if you're on a tight time table with somewhere to go afterwards, we were there for almost an hour and normally we only take 30 minutes in a sushi place.

Never refilled my drink, and almost forgot one roll which I reminded her about which she finally brought after we were done and ready to leave. To top it all off when paying she gave me a pen that would not mechanically write. You had to try to hold the button down and write at the same time. Of coarse she never came back by so I never left a tip. Could not write anything.   The food was ok the sushi was maybe a 7 out of 10. The teriyaki dish was barely a 3 out of 10.

    "text": "We haven't had such great experiences with Teppan places around these parts. Either the service is terrible, or the food is dreadful - or both.  However, we really wanted to try some Teppan since we were in the area. So, why not give this neighborhood establishment a try?  I'm not sure if this Sakana is affiliated with the Sakana in McCormick ranch. Now, that place had awesome Sushi. Perhaps, it was just coincidence that they have the same business name. But, the reviews looked just as promising.  Typical Teppan places are normally spacious and expansive. This place is more compact than what we were accustomed to. However, the smiling faces of the servers, and the friendliness of the bar tender allayed any reservations we had about how this place would deliver.  We were the only ones seated at the Teppan table. It wasn't that busy of a night, and most of the patrons were either at the bar or at the Sushi area. This was great because that allowed us to have the chef's undivided attention.  The first thing we noticed, upon being seated, was the impeccable cleanliness of the grill. On our last Teppan experience, at their competitor down the street; we were presented with a not so pristine (and even slightly dirty) cooking grill. It wasn't appealing at all to see.  To top it all off,  the food was dreadful.  Not here. I mentioned my observation to Steve and he agreed with my assertion. The owners are quite particular of the cleanliness of the food preparation area, in spite of the smaller size of their establishment.  My wife had the sirloin steak. And, as always, I had the Steak / Shrimp / Lobster Combination. Steve was meticulous in his preparation. He did ask if we wanted the full experience. We opted for great conversation with our chef, and him focusing on food preparation without the revelry.  My wife's steak was  tender and amazingly flavored. It was well prepared and marinated beforehand.  Steve's masterful and artful cooking, plus his attention to detail,  ensured that outcome  My lobster was good. It wasn't as sweet as I was accustomed to, but good, nonetheless. The shrimp was a little bit tough, but still quite flavorful.  My steak was just delectable.   The accompanying rice was not too salty, which I despise in Teppan places. Most places tend to be very heavy-handed with the soy sauce. The various added vegetables were well cooked, and they were rich in texture and flavor.  We were quite surprised as to what this little establishment delivered as far as our meal was concerned. Their service and their product were both exemplary.",

When it comes to sushi, there are plenty of unique and fun options to choose from! I wanted to order them all! My personal opinion, spicy tuna rolls are a must. They weren't as spicy as I was hoping, but still a fun thing to have.  We also had their tempura udon bowl, which was also filling, and had a bunch of deep fried veggies, such as zucchini and sweet potato, with crab meat and shrimp tempura.",

I am from California where Sushi is a staple and this  is NOT quality sushi. I don't know what you call this. Poor customer service. Never got a menu, had to flag down someone took over 6 minutes. Never got a napkin or setting. Sushi chefs were talking badly about other customers and cussing. Got something called the \"happy salmon Dynamite\". It looks like dynamite exploded out of a diaper. Took leftovers of it all to take home to give to my dog but I don't think I'm going to be that cruel. I will just throw away. Wish I could get my money back. What a waste of time, effort and money. Fish is not even kept well, (photo attached). Fishe was just tossed in there all together. Maybe this is what they give people I have no idea? Not neat, no pride.",

We loved the texture of the noodles. However, the broth lacked the flavor we were expecting. We had to add lots of soy sauce to get better flavor but it still was disappointing. We also ordered the Shrimp Tempura rolls and the Scallop Dynamite. They were both really good!  The Scallop Dynamite was loaded with scallops and crab meat. Delicious! Although, we were disappointed with the flavor of our Ramen, we would come back and try a different type of Ramen. We'd definitely come back for the sushi. The service was pretty good too.",

Since I knew we were going to be about a party of 7 I arrived a little earlier than our normal time to get our name on a list to get a table, only had about a 15-minute wait time, so it wasn't too bad.  Monday thru Thursday all day is Sakana Happy Roll, which offers 17 rolls at discount price starting at $3.45 and up to $5.95 I think. And if you're thinking the rolls are of the smaller size, think again, they are full rolls! Cant beat those prices!  I ordered the California roll, Alaska roll and the Mexican Caliente roll, I was told the caliente roll was spicy, but found it lacking in heat, but overall, I did enjoy my dinner.  Another great diner for the ISCUYE!",

Good prices! Friendly service  The Bad: My bf ordered the teriyaki chicken lunch special. He found some of the pieces raw - still not cooked enough. After he and I saw that, we could not eat anymore. We did not want to make a scene, so we just left the pieces on the plate.  I ordered the sashimi plate. The sashimi were not fresh. The salmon pieces tasted salty and had a rubber like texture.

And the service which used to be amazing has become uncaring and rude 3 mistakes to run up my order they charged my card 3 different times for three different prices. spent the last 20 minutes trying to rectify the situation.  The food I'm pretty sure they don't have any real Japanese chefs making sushi or food in the kitchen considering the teriyaki chicken was more like fajitas worst teriyaki chicken I have ever had in my life. Hands down no joke. I mean who put the sauteed bell peppers with teriyaki chicken? The only thing that was missing what's the Tapatio. couldn't make heads or tails of that dish awful. then my daughter had some sort of sushi roll tasteless and disgusting. There's no way a real Japanese sushi chef would have made this. As for the service well the waitress never cleared one dish from our table while we were eating the dishes are way too large for the table it was a cluttered mess she was tipped appropriately.  The fried rice was fine. the yellowtail hama was a bit dry. But all in all whoever is running the place has turned from a place I used to want to get to the minute they opened to avoid the huge crowds to a place that we will from here on forward avoid with sadness. Used to have to wait there would be a line to get in at the sushi bar right when they open.  But now 9 o'clock on a Friday night the place is half empty I hope they read Yelp and I hope they see the changes that made are not for the best. Goodbye Sakana we won't come back.",

The bad: Employee turnover, and with that comes the inevitable drop in customer service quality. They used to greet me by my first name, unfortunately it's no longer the case. It was nice while it lasted. Not a huge deal, after all it's just the way it goes nowadays, isn't it?",

The first thing one notices about the food, is ....the -ginger-!ZOMGZ, if the ginger is any indication of what the food itself will be, then WOWZA.  I do not understand where the negative reviews concerning the quality of the fish come from. I had the yellowtail nigiri, and the yellowtail booty roll[made by the legendary Ramon, I was told by our lovely waitress =)], and both were superb.[I WILL be back for more yellowtail, I'm addicted to it, must.have.more.]  The eel[unagi] nigiri was amazing;best eel I have had in Az for sure, with none of that rubberry, gross greasy, floppiness[cough Teharu cough].  We then tried several speciality rolls, all of which were super fresh, creative and huuuuge-I was stuffed, and usually a sushi dinner leaves me not exactly full.  Wil ldefinitely be back for the sashimi lunch!",

That said, for Phoenix, this place is right up there with Ra in regards to quality and freshness.  The service is what impressed me right off the bat.  There is something to be said for a place that hires pretty and friendly girls in a location where you wouldn't necessarily expect it.    The $10 lunch special is quite a value, and when you consider the free edamame for checking in via yelp (I love those little perks) and then get a delicious beer to go with it you're spoiling yourself for lunch at this place.  The miso soup and salad that come with the lunch are equally delicious and it is safe to say that I will be back at least once a month going forward.  Bravo Sakana - you won a fan!!  My plan is to go at some point for dinner to get the tepanyaki - I imagine the quality will be right there with Benihana at a fraction of the price.",

    "text": "GOODNESS (DAILY) GRACIOUS.  I did it.  I fucking did it.  Finally came here for dinner to try the teppanyaki and it did NOT disappoint.  While we were waiting for an available chef to finish up on some other tables (sometimes people are so selfish, hogging a chef all to themselves), I couldn't help but notice that one of them was quite animated while the other was kind of...uh, robotronic (?).  After pregaming with some soft shell crab rolls (UH YEAH) and salmon sashimi, I was quite in the mood for some grilled awesomeness.  Luckily, we got the animated chef as our entertainer/cook.  LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL!  I don't want to spoil the experience for anyone who has not yet been here, but I felt the inner child in me exploding in awe-inspiring wonder and hunger as the chef went through the motions of throwing eggs in the air, skillfully chopping veggies, making DELICIOUS fried rice, and finally the greatest moment ever - frying up the rib eye steak I ordered.  I wanted mine rare and that's exactly how I got it served!  Excellent food and an even more wonderful show to boot.  I'm 100% sure that my buddy and I were at least 8000x more excited about the dinner experience than the lame-ass* kids sitting across from us.  They didn't even take the swig of sake after getting the broccoli tossed in their mouths!  Psh, amateurs.  *Here I'm using lame in place of \"un fun\" as opposed to \"unable to use their legs\" (like FDR Jr!  Okay I'm done).  When I factor in the quality of food, the value of what I paid for, and of course the excellent show on top of it all (not to mention that I'm in Phoenix), this is an easy A to give out, even if it's not to Emma Stone (ooooo I want to have a taste of her teppanyaki, wassuuuup).",

    "text": "Came to Sakana in Ahwatukee tonight because we were in the area and I had a great experience at the Scottsdale location. I regret that decision.  The music was very loud for dining, the galley style dining area in which we were seated was sort of cramped and was the only access to the bathroom so my shoulders were rubbed by people's behinds three times as they passed. The waitstaff started to clean the dining room and flip the chairs as we ate, although there were at least 4 other occupied tables in the restaurant and they did not close until 10:30 (we paid our bill and left at 10:40).  This brings us to the food; I was extremely disappointed in the sushi quality. We ordered whitetail and unagi to start and the unagi was unusually fishy in flavor and was over cooked. The cut of the whitetail was generous, but not the knife skill I am used to. It was not trimmed on the thin side of the filet and wasn't a consistent thickness all the way through.   About this time we were delivered a mug of hot green tea, which was odd because we didn't order any, were told they were bringing us another, then about one minute later a server came by and said sorry and took it from our table. This only seemed odd because when I waited tables I would never think of taking something from a table, even after serving it to the incorrect one. We then had the Roller Coaster roll and found the spicy tuna on top to be mushy and flavorless.   The best thing about the meal was the tempura calamari. It was crispy and flavorful and not greasy. I expected more based my previous experience, not sure if it was just an off night but the number of issues were off putting.",

I try to eat healthy on the road, so was happy it was a quick in and out option. I went on a Sunday, so it was nice to hit happy hour. I'm not sure of times, but we got a menu with lots of rolls at half-price. Naturally, we went for the Vegas roll, which was delicious and the Spicy Tuna.  Both came out super fast and tasted very nice. The service was quick and we were basically in and out in less then 30 minutes. I was able to get the free edamame with my check-in on Yelp, which was nice! They had lots of sashami, but unfortunately, none of that was on the happy hour menu. Over all it is a nice, all be it, very darkly lit sushi restaurant to sit in, with football playing for those interested.",

Now this isn't always bad, but it's certainly a red flag. We got 4 rolls - Alaskan, rolly polly, spicy tuna and Vegas roll. First of all, it should be illegal to mix fake crab and salmon - that's typically NOT how Alaskan rolls are. The general quality of the fish was sub-par, but that's okay since there was way more rice than fish so I didn't taste much of it. When we got the spicy tuna roll, it was pale. That's not how spicy tuna is supposed to look. We didn't even touch it because it looked gross. The waiter brought us a to go box anyways but we just left it since we didn't want to ever eat that crappy sushi again. I need to drink enough alcohol to forget ever eating at this place.",

I have a ton of beloved sushi spots in CA and Sakana surpasses many of them - I am a sushi lover and now that I live in AZ I am somewhat of a regular at Sakana.  (And will not try any other sushi spot in AZ because I love this one so much!!)  There never really is a time that is not busy, which says a lot about the place.  I can only speak for the sushi as I have never had anything from the grill - but the fish is fresh and the flavors of the rolls are well balanced and not laden in sauces.  I appreciate that the service is always friendly and efficient as well, literally every time we go and no matter how packed it is.  If you go for lunch, I highly recommend their poke bowl - it is a fairly large serving and is absolutely delicious!  Also, a must for lovers of spice - you HAVE to try the flaming edamame.  The spicy salmon hand-rolls are another favorite... the amount of fish served is generous compared to many other places that load up on the rice.  Other favorites include the salmon sashimi and the blood orange roll.  The best part is that all of this comes at a very reasonable price.",

Somehow though Phoenix remains without a great Teppan restaurant.  My nephew is an Asian food junkie and loves Teppan, so for his birthday we really wanted to give him a great experience and Sakana remained one of two places in town we have not tried so onward...  We were sat immediately about 15 minutes prior to our reservation and quickly ordered drinks and sushi.  After reading other reviews I walked over to the sushi bar and looked at the day's specials.  We ordered two types of Nigiri off the special board and then Uni and Spicy Scallops.  For my nephew we got a spicy tuna roll.  There was nothing wrong with any of it.  The sushi had a clean taste and was very good.  It was a pleasant surprise.  The teppan started with a decent soup and salad.  The show itself was good, not great.  The portions of the meats were astonishing, absolutely huge.  Same with the veggies.  The rice was good and came in the standard cup.  A little odd was that the rice and veggies were an add on for an additional $3.  Not a big deal but just different.  Overall all the meats and the shrimp were okay.  I took a piece of my husband's steak as Teppan steak I always feel has the best flavor for steak from my perspective as a non steak eater, and it tasted like typical steak.  So basically the whole food experience was a standard.  Nothing really standing out, nothing bad.  On the other side was the service.  Lackadaisical is the word that comes to mind.    My sister said she felt she bussed our table.  Since our party of 4 was alone at the teppan table we kept passing her our dishes to put on the other end as not one thing was removed from the table.  Think about the number of items I mentioned having and how many dishes that means!  I had to ask to get water and tea refills and my glasses were removed and returned in the most bizarre way.  A pitcher could have been so much simpler.  It took a good 15 minutes for my sister's beverage to come from the bar.  It was almost an hour before the teppan chef came over.    The server though was personable enough that the non-service service was less irritating than it might have been in other circumstances.  I doubt I will be back, but it wasn't a bad experience and for someone in the Ahwatukee area i would say if they have time and don't have a ton of money to spend on Teppan or sushi it is not  a bad choice.",

Actually, my nephew once said that he preferred Sushi 101 on University because their nigiri were smaller and fit into your mouth better.  What kind of American is that? The portions at Sakana are pretty big, he does have a point... but I'm all about maximizing my buck and the quality has NEVER disappointed.  Try the salmon (NOT smoked) and the yellowtail nigiri. Melts in your mouth.",

The moment you walk in the door you are happily greeted by basically everyone working there.  Its very pleasant and I was a bit skeptical about the sincerity of it.  It only took a few min to observe that everyone working here was genuinely happy to have you as a customer.  Some of the sushi chefs are shouting jokes with the customers and staff and everyone, including customers, are laughing.  This was so odd to me but it made for and EXTREAMLY enjoyable dinner.  I had a great time, so did the rest of the customers.  The fish portions are very generous here.  The sushi had a clean taste with just the right amount of delicate flavoring.  Some of the best I've tried...period!    I highly recommend this place and I will be back for more.  I really did leave with a smile =)",

    "text": "I'll say it.    There is \"sushi\".    And then there is \"SUSHI\"  What most people consider sushi is some form of rice-rolled fish in a seaweed wrapper.  Maybe some cucumber rolled in if you're feeling inventive.  But what Sakana serves is so far beyond what I've had anywhere else, its almost sad for them to have to downgrade themselves as serving the same cuisine as some other throwaway joints around town and hell, around the country.  When you find your favorite sushi spot, you just 'know it'.  Its like reading your car manual and discovering you have a sweet feature you haven't even been utilizing.  Then you abuse the fuck out of it.    I want to abuse the fuck out of the Sakana yellowtail, both in Nigiri and Maki form.  It is the freshest I've had anywhere, and (pardon the name dropping) but I've eaten at Koi in LA and Miko in Vancouver.  How they do it in a land-locked dustbowl is a mystery to me.  Whatever magic they use works, which they also must use to enlarge the rolls because they are a GREAT size.  Not too big so you can't get em in one bite, but almost.  For their size, the prices are VERY reasonable.  Go here for your every-day-sushi and stop throwing it away at shi-shi celeb ventures like SeaSaw and Stingray (disclaimer: There is CERTAINLY a time for celebrity sushi, but IMO, not appropriate for everyday dine-out sushi)",

    "text": "My husband and I just moved to the Phoenix area from Ohio. We really enjoy our Japanese cuisine and thought that our native state had some really great places to offer.   However, we are now fortunate enough to live within walking distance of Sakana. We figured we'd give it a try on a random recommendation, and we are so happy we went.   You wouldn't expect much out of this place, being shoved into a tiny strip mall, but the restaurant is of fair size and has a very moody/laid back atmosphere. The hostess greeted us in Japanese, which sort of took us aback, but it was a nice touch. Everyone was really friendly and the wait staff was very knowledgeable about the items on the menu.  As far as the food goes, it was excellent. I had an Alaskan Roll which was some of the best sushi I have had in a while. My husband had equally good sushi in a dish that I cannot remember the name of! We tried the spring rolls as an appetizer and enjoyed those. They tasted nice and fresh.  The only negative, and it's really not that bad, is that it is a little pricey.Especially if you are trying to pinch your budget as my family is, but it's not an extravagant price. It is affordable if you have extra cash for dinner out.  All in all, it was really enjoyable and good and I am looking forward to returning.",

Don't get adventurous here because they'll make you hate all the good stuff that you would enjoy otherwise. One such example is their uni which is not fresh and served in too large a portion.  The service is also terrible. They have a lame attitude and last time I got the caterpillar roll, I told the waiter that it tasted bad so he laughed and walked away not offering to exchange it. I ended up paying for it with part of his tip.  Their rolls are humongous so if you're a glutton who doesn't care about taste, this could be your sushi place. Most rolls contain lots of fake crab.",

    "text": "Coming from California you can feel my snub towards desert sushi.  Also while visiting Arizona a while back was the first time I've ever had BAD sushi. BUT-how much longer could I have avoided such sushi cravings I've been having since I moved here? I need sushi in my life...  AMBIANCE:  Its interesting how sushi houses in Phoenix take orders by having a paper menu which the party can mark themselves. (Highly efficient btw.)  Located in a random shopping center, Sakana has a comfortable atmosphere with a little more real estate than you would figure this spot to be from the outside. Family & hip(ster-ish) oriented (patrons & servers alike) instead of the familiar K-pop cover ballads they played some 90's pop hits from MJ to Prince. Nothing like your 'HE HEEE'S!' & purple rain while you're scarfing down some good fish. Its casual.  SUSHI & SERVICE:  I went with a party of 5 on a Sunday with most of the tables occupied. Even so I was surprised we got our drinks & smoked salmon sashimi  within 5 minutes. We sampled 6 different rolls-from baked scallop to the tootsie roll to the fried Californian. All which I should say is pretty LEGIT. Not the straight out the water fresh but the THIS-IS-AS-GOOD-AS-IT-CAN-GET-SUSHI- WISE-OUT-HERE fresh. Which is all I can ask for! Really, it was DELICIOSO.  -The rolls are your standard size for (Americanized) sushi about 4-6 pieces. -If you ever order the baked scallop roll they bless it with an abundance of crab meat/chopped up scallops & topped off with sprinkled fish eggs-no room for dissapointment here.   Though Sakana has 2 other locations in the valley it does not have the flavor of 'chain' sushi. Also they mixed up an order of a massive sushi plater & placed it on our table then had to quickly take it back right when my cousin was about to pinch one with her chopsticks. Well 2 minutes later we were served a plate of another Vegas roll-on the house. To compensate for the possible emotional distress you may have caused taking away  that triple roll platter-compensate you did. NOTED.  BRAVO Sakana for your timely & friendly service, being open on sunday & the complimentary sushi. I shall return to this sushi house in the desert! Finally a place for my sushi fix.",

The chefs are very flexible and friendly and are able to make any suggestions necessary as long as you ask politely.  Happy hour Sunday-Thursday and beer specials with discounted apps every day!  Very affordable and tasty, they have something for everyone.  Still have yet to try their teppanyaki, but I've never heard any complaints.  The baked scallop roll and Fiji Tiger roll are a must have!  PS- be nice to servers, we make less than minimum wage and more than half of the income comes from tips.  We try the best we can!",

Ada G. and I love the Baked Scallop roll and their Ahi Tetaki Salad is a favorite too. We've smartened up and gotten the toddler his own ahi roll on occasion so he wouldn't eat all of ours and peace was maintained. (How do they do this in the UN? It's exhausting!) When you order a large Sapporo you get a 50 cent seaweed salad too! Don't you love a bargain?   When I came here when I was gainfully employed, lunch would always take an hour and a half so don't expect something quick, but it's always good. My husband doesn't care for it as much because he considers himself to be a True connoisseur but I like the rolls so I'm right at home here.",

The place was crawling with people and the restaurant offers sushi as well as teppanyaki so there were quite a few people who opted the teppanyaki.  There was four of us so since I was the only asian person in the group and no one has dined here before other than myself, they let me order for the table.  I ordered edamame, tempura, and three specialty rolls(The Jackpot roll was one and two other ones). I wish I could tell you the names of the other two - all three were <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>.  If they updated their menus online, I could of told you what we had.  Two of the group were amazed that sushi can be so flavorful and this good!  They said they have never tasted sushi like this before.  My response, \"You are missing out!\".   Two in the group ordered japanese beer and they were pretty big bottles.  The bill with tip came to $60 ($15/pp).  Not bad!",

Anyways I was greeted by this really nice young girl and was sat down immediately. They give you a paper with a list of sushi to choose from. I ordered the shrimp tempura roll, California roll and spicy scallop. It came about 5 minutes after my order and I was very disappointed with the taste of the sushi. I did not like them at all. It was so bland and there was no taste. The shrimp tempura roll had very little shrimp in each bite and I could hardly taste it. It wasn't crunchy. It was cold and soggy. I am starting to realize that a lot of the sushi places around here probably won't be as good as California's sushi places cuz their closer to the ocean....bummer :/   They only get 2 stars for the excellent service.  Therefore other than that, I will not be returning.",

I will say that all the rolls we ordered were quite delicious, but got way too full too early so save room! Spicy tuna, Las Vegas and Toostie Rolls were the winners that evening.    We came here for a late dinner, and they were very forceful with us after last call for sushi. It made us feel like they were rushing out to pay the bill. I wouldn't mind coming back here to grab a couple rolls again.",

Only a few though, so we basically picked them out and set them aside. The sushi that we ordered was mostly just OK. The ingredients seemed fine but nothing was particularly good. Sushi is one of those things where a bad experience could be because of what you ordered though so maybe there are better rolls to get and we just chose poorly. Not sure if I'll hit them up again, but maybe I will to give them another chance since there are mostly good reviews. Our server was very nice, helpful and kept on top of everything.",

Waved another server down and our first server saw that someone else was taking our order so she swung by told the 2nd server something and just ignored us.  I get that people forget but if you don't try to correct the situation it doesn't seem like you value your costumers much.  After we were done eating we waited a while for our check and a 3rd server came by and asked if we ever got our check.    We had 3 servers and the only time  someone came to check up on us was when we waited for our check.It wasn't even busy and it felt so unorganized.    Food was good but based on the service I received,  I probably won't be going back.",

There is no reason that should be like that. On top of that, the fish itself was not fresh at all and came out WARM. Everyone knows raw fish is not good warm. I was disappointed with everything I had sushi-wise. Fried rice was good though. Also, the restaurant itself is very small, cluttered, and seems a little dirty overall. I personally feel there are other, better sushi options in town. Like  I am genuinely confused as to how this place has such a high rating.",

Teppanyaki was flavorless, under performed, and way overpriced. They pressure you to get the add on costs for veggies and rice (which typically comes with teppen). The salmon was good but the sushi was a little odd tasting.  But I'm picky about my sushi too. Will not return or recommend this place to others.",

    "text": "I should have known better when I walked in, because the place looked like it was a pool hall that had been converted into a sushi joint...carpet on the floor and all.  Where there once was a full bar, bottles of alcohol have now been replaced by raw fish behind the counter. In the place where pool tables once were, are now teppanyaki grills. This is all, of course, my imagination running away with me, as I have no idea what the place was before.  Needless to say, the quality of the sushi matched what you'd expect walking in. Again, I should have known better, because when I asked if they had any sashimi platters, the waitress told me they only serve sashimi at lunch. At a sushi restaurant. Really? Ok...  Whenever I go to a sushi restaurant and I'm a bit suspect about the quality of the fish, I usually will order some rolls along with the sushi, just to be on the safe side.   Unfortunately, everything was bad. I ordered a few nigiri pieces, along with a specialty shrimp tempura roll (I think it was called something like the Crazy Roller Coaster Roll). The piece of shrimp tempura was so thin and small that it was basically like they had just put fried batter in the roll. The rice was too sticky, like they just used plain white rice instead of sushi rice. Which leads to the next item: the nigiri. Too sticky rice with cuts of fish that were just too bulky and fishy... I really couldn't get myself to eat more than the first trial piece.   The service was fine, so I maybe should have given 2 stars...but since I'm still hungry an hour after my meal, my hangry side just got the best of me. Maybe I should go eat a Snickers now.",

    "text": "The Sunday night happy hour here is amazing!  I'm not sure how long the happy hour lasts, but we came at 7 pm and got to take advantage of it.  They have about 10 rolls on their HH menu for only $4-5 each.  We thought the rolls would be really small bc the waitress told us they would only come with 5 pieces (instead of the 8 pieces from the regular menu) but they were just as big as rolls that I'm used to eating.  I ordered an appetizer and two rolls and I actually had to take one entire roll home because I was soooo full.  For appetizer I got agedashi tofu.  It was different than I'm used to, because the tofu pieces were pretty small, but there were a LOT of them. I'm used to larger, but fewer, pieces of tofu.  The sauce they had it in was delicious and spot on.  But I think that they do not dip the tofu in potato starch like other places do bc the outside wasn't that slippery chewy texture, it was straight up just fried tofu.  I probably would not order this dish again.  For my rolls I got spicy tuna and scallop dynamite.  The spicy tuna was what you'd except, but VERY large pieces in the roll!  I couldn't even fit a whole piece in my mouth at one time.  The scallop roll was a california roll topped with a LARGE mound of krab and scallops (cooked).  It was a warm roll.  I enjoyed it, although I was expecting the scallops to be raw!  I think I would've liked it better if they had been raw, but it was still good.  p.s. - if you check in on yelp you can score a free edamame appetizer!",

    "text": "In an effort to try something new on a monthly basis, my daughter wanted to do our monthly dinner and her birthday dinner at Sakana in Ahwatukee.  I made sure to make reservations for the teppanyaki because it was on a Saturday and I didn't want to wait very long.  However, when we got there, we were seated right away.  Never having had sushi before I relied on my friend that we do our monthly dinners with, to help me pick out something that I would like.  There are so many sushi rolls to choose from, it was very hard to make a choice for just one or two.  Considering that I was still going to have something from the teppan grill I hoped I chose wisely.    My friend ordered 2 of the spicy/hot sushi rolls, I had the Alaskan and Philadelphia rolls, along with the chicken from the teppan.  My daughter and her friend had the chicken as well.  We also ordered spring rolls for my daughter since she really didn't want sushi.  Of course, we made her try it; but her opinion doesn't matter in this review, lol, since she rarely likes anything.  Suffice it to say, that although she thought it was okay, she will never go to out for sushi.  As for my friend, he thought his sushi was excellent; it had a nice bite to it, and the heat was just right.  My sushi was actually quite good, considering I hate fish.  I couldn't taste the salmon (which is a good thing) in the Philadelphia roll and the cream cheese was a little on the heavy side, but still quite tasty.  The tuna was yummy; normally a hater of canned tuna, this is NOTHING like that swill.    Now here's where the 3 stars come in.  I wasn't impressed with our teppan chef.  He did his utensil tricks while the grill got hot and the oil heated up, but other than that, I wasn't impressed.  The fried rice was great (for an added $3 you can get rice and veggies with the chicken); the veggies were great, but the chicken was not only bland but dry.    I've read in other reviews how the service was slow; that was not the case for us.  Granted, we were not on the sushi side, and we were there at 5 when it was basically bare (when we left though, there was a line waiting to be seated).  I would say, give the place a try.  I had a great time with my daughter and friend, and it was fun trying something new, that tasted nothing like I expected it to.  The atmosphere is the same as any restaurant you find in a strip mall, but don't let that deter you.  I do believe if I go there again, I will just order off the menu and not get teppan.  I'll definitely try more sushi though.  **Side note: in order to get a chef for the teppan grill, you must order 2 items from the teppan menu.  I believe it starts at $11.99 just for the meat/seafood.",

She had brought another table our order and their order to our table. Another 15 minutes of waiting to get our order re-made, and we finally got to eat. We arrived at 7pm and left around 9:30pm.   Again, the quality of the sushi was great. I enjoyed the rolls and the prices were excellent.  I'd give Sakana another chance, in hopes that the waitress was new or training.",

They were just greasy little poppers of deliciousness. In between the appetizers we ordered a little bit of sushi, which was tasty, but definitely fell apart like other reviews have mentioned.I think the problem was overstuffing; the paper was just barely wrapped around all of the sushi. After that came the teppan steak. It was prepared perfectly and the cook was great. He tried to talk to us a bit but the restaurant was a bit too loud and crowded so that didn't pan out.  Lastly, I'll just mention a bit about the service. Our waitress was very kind but man did she seem in a hurry. I know the place was busy but I didn't get to feel as relaxed as I wish I could have. If I go back I'll try not to hit a peak time in service just to see if that was a fluke.",

    "text": "It pains me to write this review.  I've been going to Sakana since grad school in 2007, when we'd hit up the 59th Ave. location regularly.  When I moved, I was happy to find this location was close to the house and it became my 'take-out' sushi joint.  Probably went there 20 times in the past year - mostly with called in orders, but often dragging the (non-sushi-eating) boyfriend along for a dine in.  Rolls are big and stuffed with fish, esp. for the price, and the quality is pretty good.  So what happened? 2 terrible experiences in a row.    In May, I had a hankerin' for take-out, called in my order, and got the usual \"It'll be ready in 30 minutes.\"  Perfect.  Enough time to drive over, stop at the Safeway and get some beer before picking up the delicious yumminess.  Did that, got the sushi, paid and was halfway home when it occurred to me that there were fewer boxes than usual.  Pulled over, did a check and... sure enough, they forgot my nigiri.  Darn.  Called them up, told them what happened, and headed over to pick up my food.  (I had been charged for it, I was going to get it.)  Head to the hostess, tell her who I am, \"Oh, ok.  We'll put that order in for you.\" Uh? You didn't already? \"You're going to expedite it, right?\" \"Oh, of course.\"  So I wait.  And wait.  And wait.  How long does it take to make up 8 rice balls, wasabi them and plop pre-cut fish?! Talk to the hostess... it is coming? My other sushi IS sitting in the car.  \"I'll go check.\"  Ok... so I wait some more.  I've been irritated for a while now, but apparently it is becoming visible.  It has been 30(!!) minutes since my \"expedited\" order was put in (70 minutes since my original order was phoned in).  The manager sees this and comes over, asking what is wrong.  I tell him.  To his credit, he gets the order handled and gives me a $10 coupon to come back.  Still annoyed, but mollified, I head out.  Fast forward to last night.  I have my coupon and a hankerin' for sushi, so wrassle up the boy and head back to give Sakana another chance.  I put our name on the list (30 minute wait) and, because it is crowded & noisy, head outside to wait.  There are several other folks out there and, periodically, the hostess comes out calling names.  Once. Twice.  Three times.  She comes out, calling names.    After a while, someone comes out and lights up a cigarette within smelling range (ew!!!), so the boy and I head inside to wait.  Names are called.  New people come in and get their names on the list.  More people are seated.  It can't be long now! Then the hostess goes out and fetches some of the new people, happily taking them to a table.    WTF?! The boy goes and looks at the list.  We've been crossed off.  WTFF?! Our name hadn't been called - we were in earshot the entire time; why was it crossed off? Forget this - I guess they don't want us to eat here.  So we got up and went across town to my True favorite sushi place.  (If it weren't such a long drive to Scottsdale, we'd always go there.)  Which worked out much better, since the staff recognize us, the fish is better, there is more non-sushi variety for the boy, and it is much less noisy and crowded.  I'll be back to Sakana one more time.  I still have that coupon after all and $10 of sushi is $10 of sushi.  But now I'm on the prowl for a new sushi place close by to become my new \"take out\" place.  It's too bad... I DO like them a lot, but to receive execrable service two times in a row is unacceptable.",

This was what the birthday boy wanted to do with the rest of the kids for his birthday.  They always wanted to go to a Teppan so we picked this place. We were seated right away. We had the whole Teppan table to ourselves since there were 8 of us. Our waiter, Josh, took our orders right away but once he did, he was MIA for most of the evening. We barely could get a hold of him. A friend and I had to help ourselves to getting napkins, utensils, emptying the table when we were done with our soup and salad and getting to go boxes for our leftover food. He forgot to bring my bf's Kirin so we had to hunt him down for that. But he, also, forgot to bring us our appetizers which was included in the Teppan Special. We were busy with the kids and watching Moonie, our Teppan chef that we didn't get a chance to hunt him down for our appetizers. I understand that he got busy but it is uncalled for when we barely saw him nor came to our table to make sure everything was good or if we needed anything else. He should have had the manager assist him. I had to hunt him down to get our 4th sushi roll. Our Teppan chef, on the other hand, was awesome! Moonie totally entertained the kids so that helped make our dinner somewhat special. Overall, I wasn't happy with the service but the food was good. If it wasn't for Monnie, I would have told my bf to not tip Josh but we felt it would be unfair to Moonie...good thing we gave him a little tip earlier after he cooked for us. Every adult in our table have been in that kind of industry - we've all waited tables so we know how it is when you get swamped. A good waiter should have asked for help. We were appalled with the kind of service we got. I know we weren't the only one because the table behind us were griping about Josh's service as well. He forgot to bring the rest of their sushi and they waited a long time as well.",

They were busy when we got there so we waited a bit which wasn't terrible but consistently the service was slow and another waitress had to basically take over our table. Worst of all, the sushi was bizarre. I ordered an Alaskan roll and spicy tuna and the Alaskan came out as a gigantic roll with piles of salmon and mayo-filled fake crab salad and no avocado. I appreciate the value I guess? but having the huge roll with that in it was inedible and I have never not finished a sushi roll. The spicy tuna had tons of mayo-y spicy tuna and then more fake crab mush. Our tofu tempura appetizer came out after the entrees. The music was also strange- loud 90s music. The hibachi chef clanging in the corner with a gaggle of women yelling 'woohoo!' didn't add to the experience. Not sure we'll be back.",

Our orders all came at different times, so none of us were actually enjoying our meals together.  2 of us ordered the exact same thing, only 1 order was never placed by the server, so an extra 15 minutes went by before it was served.  The Las Vegas roll we ordered was not very palatable and part of the salmon used in it appeared to be tuna.  A calamari salad was ordered and had way too much dressing in in, drowning the calamari and lettuce.  What struck me as strange, is that for a full service Japanese restaurant, there is really only 4 entrees to choose from for dinner, the rest is sushi.  Probably wont be coming back to this place.",

The portions are VERY generous, the atmosphere is quiet and cozy, the staff is happy and friendly and the focus is on good food, not a cool image.   While it appears they don't have a \"happy hour\" at Sakana, they do have a special \"Customer Appreciation\" menu (Mon-Thur) with discounted prices on the most popular rolls. Plus, last night when we went, there was a special of \"order a Kirin or Kirin Light and get an appetizer for 50 cents.\" What a deal!  Also, this is a great place to go with a group because of the Teppanyaki Grill tables, and that is always a fun time! Sakana is one of Ahwatukee's best kept secrets for True sushi lovers!",

Knowing that have a huge daily special for only $10 I thought it would be perfect to share with my daughter, I think it comes with 5 pieces of assorted sushi fish, a crunchy California roll, crab tempura and a stuffed shrimp egg roll thing plus soup and salad, definitely a lot of food!   That's what we planned on ordering until we sat down at the sushi bar and saw them pre-making the CA rolls and setting them off to the side on a large tray...UGH you know how I HATE pre made stuff!   I decided on a tuna/avocado roll and Val got a shrimp tempura roll, I also ordered a cucumber salad.   Well I'm much more for quality over quantity and Sakana seems to be the other way around, yeah they give you a lot but it's really not that great.   My tuna roll was OK, the Shrimp tempura roll was filled with an enormous amount of mayonnaisey Krab meat and my cucumber salad was a giant bowl, probably 3 cucumbers worth, of just plain cucumbers WTH?   I tried to explain to the guy making the sushi but he didn't understand my English because he spoke mainly Spanish and I don't think the waitress understood to clearly either when she returned to me with another bowl of less amount and less fresh cucumbers, plain again but with a drizzle of something foul.   There is much much better sushi to be had and I'm more than happy to pay for it elsewhere because Sakana's sushi isn't quality sushi to my standards.

    "text": "What a difference a guided tour and 24 hours can make!  Upon learning of my less-than-stellar reaction to their favorite sushi and teppan spot, the insisted I return. And am I ever happy I did!  This time I stuck to the small board of \"specials\" in the back, enjoying some incredible smoked salmon and albacore. I nibbled on a little of the white toro and even had some of the teppan others were enjoying. Outstanding!  So if you go, ignore the rolls. It's as if they are made for the average schmo who doesn't really like sushi and was brought there on a dare. In fact, skip the whole menu and look behind the sushi bar to the little white board. That's the good stuff.",

    "text": "One might call me a \"sushi whore.\" So it's safe to say, \"If there's good Sushi in town, it's been in my mouth.\"  I'm from southern California where the sushi is plentiful and the quality is world-class. SAKANA is by FAR, my favorite sushi spot in the valley. The atmosphere lovely, the sushi unparalleled,  They have customer appreciation Monday-Thursday for all you penny pinchers and starving college students out there. Equally as notable, if you buy a large Kirin, you get a .50 cent appetizer; so \"bottoms up\" to the ultimate place to grab a cold one.  Oh, and Keep this under your hats, but here's a little insider tip for all you \"rock stars from Mars\": If you're looking to have some real fun- SUSHI BAR. These guys are bitchin. (If you want to find out just how \"bitchin\" they are, grab a seat and prepare to get swash buckled)...  \"Meh\"- Teppanyaki is decent, but EVERY sushi item is Perfection for the taste buds. They offer daily roll-specials so make sure to check em out when you arrive.  Eat well, live well and surround yourselves with ones who do. - Cheers.",
