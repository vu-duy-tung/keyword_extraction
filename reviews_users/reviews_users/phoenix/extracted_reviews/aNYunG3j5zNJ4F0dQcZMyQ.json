After being told that the kitchen could still function, but never being told that it would actually take orders, we left after 20 minutes of being ignored and headed to Tomaso's.  That was the best decision of the evening.  The service at Tomaso's was excellent.  The wine and food were absolutely delicious.",

I was able to secure a table without a reservation, though that may be always possible, especially on the weekends.  The wine list is extensive and impressive, including a nice selection of wines by the glass. Unfortunately they do not stock any of the great craft beers coming out of Italy. I started with a Tuscan bean soup that was good, though lacking in anything exciting. For my main, I had a daily special that was a house made swiss chard and kale ravioli stuffed with ricotta cheese, with a balsamic demi-glaze.  Service was attentive, but not smothering. Overall very good dinner.",

The decor was quietly distinguished and gave a warm upscale impression.  Two of us each ordered the Osso Bucco that had been removed from the bone. It was very blah and the pasta it was on was overdone and stuck together like one big clump of dough. How does an Italian restaurant not know how to make good al dente pasta?  Definitely won't be back.",

    "text": "I must give a shout out to this lovely restaurant. I was in Phoenix visiting a friend in the hospital and eating on my own. The hotel food was dismal, didn't want fast food, and everything else was Mexican, burger, or chain.I was craving pasta. Drove a little away from the busy section and saw Tomaso's. I thought it was a mid-range pizza place but was tired of driving around an unfamiliar city in the dark. So I walk in wearing jeans and a T-shirt (after hanging around a hospital for many hours) looking the worse for the wear. A lone oldish woman. It turns out to be a white tablecloth place with a very nicely dressed staff. A waiter greeted me and led me without hesitation to a nice table. Treated me like a valued guest and service was excellent. I had great pasta with prawns and broccolini in a light tomato based broth. Excellent rustic bread, herb butter and a perfect Chianti. I'm so grateful to have found such a respite after a long day. Thank you, Tomaso's. Highly recommend. Glad CPK had no parking!!!!",

My youngest sister also flew in as a surprise. The dinner started fine and service steadily declined. At one point we didn't see our waiter in over 20 minutes and our food took an hour to come out. These two factors combined really killed the mood at our table, as my grandfather was upset which in turn upset my dad. Additionally, the atmosphere definitely lacks compared to other restaurants of the same price caliber. In all, for the price, mediocre food, and terrible service, I would not return. There are so many other restaurants with fabulous food and service that would have made our celebrations what they should have been.",

    "text": "Eight of us dined at Tomaso's on a Sunday evening in March. Our table was understandably a large one, but soon after we were seated a few other large parties arrived as well.  Our waiter was pleasant but unattentive. He frequently forgot to collect everyone's orders as he went around the table. On more than one occasion, he placed drinks or dishes in front of the wrong person - something you expect at Denny's but not at a restaurant of this caliber. We had to search for him frequently to refill water or iced tea glasses. He failed to deliver promised second glasses of wine to two in our party, but somehow did remember to put them on the bill.  Before the meal started, we had asked for the bill to be split in half, and he gladly agreed. But he delivered a single bill. When we reminded him that we requested two bills, gave us a sour face and took a long time to bring split checks. However, the way he split the checks was incorrect and quite frankly (despite several college degrees at the table) unintelligible.   When we FINALLY got him to come by and explained that the split was done incorrectly, he blamed us, made it seem like we were being unreasonable, and then brought back the check split differently - but still incorrectly.   In the end, although the food was good, we left with a bitter taste about the restaurant. What kind of wait staff makes the customer feel bad about a problem the wait staff has?   The food was good, but none of us will subject ourselves to this terrible service again.",

They have a few private dining rooms which is what I was looking for. Out of all of the 15+ places I contacted, this was the only one that did not have a minimum amount to reserve the room! I was shocked! Especially considering how nice this restaurant is & that smaller places were requiring $800 - $1500 minimum amounts. I worked with a lovely lady named, Vincenza, who responded to me quickly, stayed in touch throughout the weeks leading up to the party & made sure it was everything I wanted & more! All of the staff here are incredibly friendly & personable. Making all the guests laugh & feel comfortable! & of course I have to talk about the food! Amazing, homemade Italian dishes that are to die for! Thank you, Tomaso's & Vincenza for making the night so special & one that we will never forget! I will recommend you to everyone!",

    "text": "Tomaso's is classic (northern) Italian in an old country setting, straight up. I was concerned after hanging around Little Italy for a month that Arizona's fare would not measure up. I was wrong.  Granted, we did not have the standard experience as we came on Christmas Eve, but the staff was friendly and warm. As we watched food being served, it seemed the same dishes kept coming up over and over again, which is good since our rookie order overlapped:  - Tuscan Legume Soup ($8): Enjoyable but otherwise unremarkable. - Mozzarella Caprese ($13): Sized for two and executed excellently. - Fish Roulade ($29): Special of the evening was fish rolled with crab and lobster meat over spinach with lobster ravioli. How can one go wrong? One can't. - Scampi Caprese & Lobster Ravioli ($28): I'd call this a miss but I'm in the minority as my parents both enjoyed it and most of the restaurant seemed to agree. - The Best Lasagna Ever ($24): A bold claim, but this really was the best lasagna I've had in a very long time - balanced flavors and not too heavy.  For dessert, an adequate tiramisu was heavily overshadowed in both size and preference by a monster cannoli.   Tomaso's is a little on the expensive side but one is clearly paying for quality of atmosphere, service and food. It meets the difficult bar of somewhere on which both my meat and potatoes parents and I can agree. For a special occasion (or on an expense account) I'd definitely drop in again.",

With regards to the food, the order consisted of the below: BEEF CARPACIO CHOPPED SALAD TARFELLE PASTA AND MEATBALLS (SPLIT INTO TWO ORDERS) VEAL CHOP LAMB CHOPS. ICE CREAM  The two appetizers were both enjoyed and the size was what you would expect. Not large nor small.  The pasta dish was shared and tasted amazing.  My companion had the lamb and he typically gets that at restraunts.  He said the meat was a good cut and cooked perfectly.   I had a veal chop not found on the menu and due to my improvisation no sides are listed.  They decided to give me a gnocchi pasta and potatoes.  I thought the chop was a bit small; however the cut (taking into account fat ratio and placement to the meat) was amazing.  I have to also give credit where credit is due in mentioning it was broiled perfectly as well.  We went to The Missiin, Different Pointe of View, & Tomasos during our stay and I have to say while the others were both great...Tomasos would inch out ahead if I were to make a suggestion to a friend.",

My husband and I both work in the service industry and were super excited to FINALLY be able to spend Valentines Day together ON Valentine's Day, instead of having to work. I've told my husband numerous times about how Tomaso's butter squash ravioli brought tears to my eyes because it was sooooo amazing! I haven't been here in several years, so when he surprised me with dinner here for Valentines Day, I was so excited! The issues started when we were seated. We were greeted with water and bread in a timely manner, but everything else seemed to take FOREVER. We sat with the wine menu closed for a good 20 minutes before our server finally came to take our drink order. He walked by us several times in these 20 minutes, so we started to think that either he forgot we were his table, or he assumed we did not have the money to dine here because of our age (mid 20's and early 30's), therefore he simply didn't care to give us good service.  We ordered a couple glasses of wine, the calamari appetizer, the chicken parmigiana, and the nights special, cioppino (which I had to ask our server about because nobody informed us about specials, yet every table around us was ordering it). The calamari was bland and soggy. My husband ordered the chicken parm and was confused when it came out with broccoli and potatoes, when the menu specifically said it came with rigatoni (I even checked the menu on our way out). The sides were lukewarm and he found a hair in his food! I ordered the cioppino and it was boring to say the least. The shrimp were sandy and the mussels had a very STRONG fishy taste, which turned me off to the dish completely. Why didn't we send our food back? Because our server was nowhere to be found during our ENTIRE meal. Not once did he touch the table other than to take our order and bring the check. This was supposed to be a special night for us and was a total letdown. For $130 we expect decent service (at the least) and hot, fresh, hairless food. It's safe to say we will never come here again.",

He helped us with the decorations, gave recommendations, and happily took pictures of us when asked. He felt like he was part of the birthday celebration! We had fantastic food: appetizers of calamari, squash blossoms, meatballs. I enjoyed homemade pasta with lobster and shrimp in a spicy tomato sauce-Scialatelli with Lobster, Shrimp & Pomodoro Piccante-what a treat, so tasty. There were so many yummy things to choose from, it was a hard choice! I enjoyed bites of other people's  Rigatoni Amatriciana & Meatballs, Tortelli Di Michalangelo Buonarotti, and Linguine Del Pescatore. I didn't have anything to drink but the cocktails, etc looked great. Aaron was also great about cutting the birthday cake. Did I mention what a fantastic waiter Aaron was?! Tomaso is lucky to have him on his team. In sum, this was the perfect choice to celebrate my dad's birthday. The whole night was impeccable: Delicious food, atmosphere, and service (i.e., Aaron). I'm glad we celebrated at Tomaso's and will gladly come eat here the next time I'm in town.",

Some places only put a few squirts but this was on all parts of the salad. I wanted to sip it up with the bread. The pasta course also had a delicious sauce, pasta a nice al dente with gave beans, artichokes and fresh peas. Moving on to the entree another delicious offering. The eggplant piled with ricotta and a marina with 3 delicious homemade butternut squash. Just the right amount of heat to balance the eggplant. The desert was two HUGE strawberries with a dollop of marscapone and a sprinkling of white and milk chocolate what tasted like a small malted milk ball. The waitstaff was attentive and kept all the glasses filled, the room temp comfortable, and the food delivered timely. Tomaso's has been here for years and the only thing that is hard is on a busy night if you don't valet parking lot is super small. But I would walk blocks to come here again!",

In the end, they comped our meal and wine brought dessert and a lovely chocolate liquor.  Tomaso came out and apologized at the finish of the evening as he was busy in the kitchen.  We were told we had a new waiter which added to the problems.  Such a disappointment for us locals because this is a great location, nice ambience (although a little too bright in main dining room).   We will stick with L'Amore, Franco's or Christos which offer a similar Menu but much tastier and more organized!!",

Waiter was quite good, the braised short rib adequate-overly salty the accompanying gnochi very tasty, but the off menu special of butterflied shrimp and risotto with logostinos  was superb.  The MAJOR disappoint was the drinks.  I ordered vodka on the rocks with onions. I have had stronger water.  The vodka was clearly watered down.  In fact the only taste came from the 3 onions.  AND it was expensive.  Went to Tomaso's after seeing the chef on a local tv station. The restaurant was founded in 1977.  Being in business almost 39 years indicates acceptance by the going out to eat crowd.    Today I was told Tomaso's is known for watering the alcohol depending upon the owner's then mood.  Order wine can't water it down.  Go for the food not the bar you should be ok.",

Service is exemplary, attentive without being intrusive. Meals are paced well, and whether I have an hour-long dinner or a three-hour dinner, it never feels rushed.  Menu items change regularly, though cult favorites - spaghetti and meatballs, for one, and the sole - are almost always available. A particular joy is the fresh-daily ravioli, which is tremendously wonderful each time.  Off-menu items, both specials and requests, are often available. Our waiter summed it up one time by saying \"If we have the parts, we'll make the dish.\" We've put that to the test a few times, and they always deliver.  A really good wine list, particularly rich in Barolo.  Highly, highly recommend.",

Explained with precise detail how plates were prepared and even offered to modify any selection to our taste. I nearly slipped off my comfortable chair when he stated \"if any of you have a favorite Italian dish and you don't see it on the menu just tell me and I will make it for you.\" All 5 of us had different menu options with each of us so in love with our meal choice we were passing spoonfuls of our meal to another saying \"try this-it is so good.\" May be a bit pricey for pasta meals, however you will not feel taken, but blessed to feel special by being in an old world Italian home for a Sunday family meal at grandma's table. I will be driving from Surprise across the valley to dine here again. Great place for a romantic meal with your special friend where quiet conversation, hand holding, and staring at each other's eyes seem very much appropriate.",

We have been visting Tomaso's for many years -whenever we come to Phoenix, and Tomaso's remains one of our favorite Italian restaurants in the entire country. I am from Brooklyn, grew up in an Italian neighborhood, and have traveled the US extensively, always looking for great Italian food (so rare in the West).  It happened to be restaurant week, so I did not order my usual veal chop caprese. Saw one gentleman eating his monstrous veal  bone (under $40), and I was jealous. But the restaurant week deal at $33 was simply too good to pass up.  Starting with a stuffed zucchini blossom and a slice of buffalo mozzarella with tomato and basil, with their crisp bread - awesome. Our entrees were lamb osso bucco with risotto - so good, and a duo of layered eggplant parm and butternut squash raviolis with sage butter.  Every single component of our meals was amazing.  Dessert choices were the angel's kisses and tiramisu - we tried both and were in heaven ourselves ending this wonderful meal.   Tomaso himself was in Italy leading a wine tour, so we missed him, but did have a DOCB Tuscan chianti which while pricy was superb.  Bravo! Tomaso's has been doing their magic for over 40 years. Enough said.",

Our waiter was Gabriel. Our table no 13. Maybe that was the reason I was served orange tagliatelle instead of spinach??? And a thick sauce that had no truffle flavor whatsoever??? Maybe that's why the waiter did not come back within the traditional minute to check whether we were happy and basically ignored our table until I had one noodle left on my plate? And when asked why the spinach was red said because the pasta was from Valentines Day (5 days ago???). It tasted ok but was not what I ordered at all. No apologies, no prior warning about the pasta, which because of its wide shape does not work with a glue paste like sauce??? My husband liked his dish. We spent 38 bucks on a lunch dish I can whip up in 12 minutes flat for 5 bucks. I am shocked by the unprofessional treatment most of all. Lastly, I wanted just Gelato for dessert. They have it as a component in one of their 10-12 dollar desserts, so just serving a scoop should not be a problem. Well, they couldn't do it. The restaurant had about 4 parties to serve at the time, so why not get things right? Huge disappointment! BTW, I happen to be Italian. And no, this place is NOT. This is evident from the fact that they serve Alfredo sauce in the first place. Definitely not a dish any real Italian restaurant in Italy would serve. And they wouldn't dare to make that sauce out of the ingredients of Cesar's salad dressing, which, BTW is Mexican. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is that my husband 's food was good. Overall, feel ripped off.",

Another half an hour went by, and we barely got the second course. The main course around in another half an hour. We finished our main dish after we spent 2 hrs here, and still haven't had the dessert yet. I understand that it is a busy day, however there are a few tables that came after us and got food served before us, wtf??!! Will never set my foot back in this place again, don't recommend it!!  Take your money elsewhere, Phoenix has too many great restaurants and good service to deal with all of this bullshit, bye Felicia!!",

I was there mid week around 8 and the place was almost empty. Two friends and I ate at the bar because it was a little too quiet in the dining room. I've been coming here for 10-15 years and the bartenders are always great.   Martinis to start. Big honest.  Caesar. Parmesan bowl. Killer croutons. Anchovies on request. Awesome.   The bartender recommended the lasagna with a side of homemade sausage. Un fn believable! So so so good. Cheesy. Lots of meat sauce. Home made pasta.   I've had almost every main dish and have never been disappointed. The pasta dishes are perfectly al dente and the chicken veal dishes are perfectly cooked with excellent sauces. The service is old school and always excellent.   The decor is a little dated but that's the only negative.",

    "text": "Dined here on Friday June 9th. Had made reservations, but no need as the restaurant wasn't busy. Many empty tables! A shame!  Started with drinks & ordered the Friend Calamari. They also offered a special which was an artichoke w/ zucchini flower. We ordered that as well but unfortunately they were out of artichokes. Ended up getting that special minus the choke with a few extra zucchini flowers. Those zucchini flowers were amazing, stuffed with mozzarella cheese & deep fried. Calamari was standard.  Caesar salad nice presentation, served in a Parmesan cheese bowl, no croutons. Again, standard in taste! I had the ravioli trio: which was an evening special. Three different samples of three types of raviolis. A tortellini in a butter sauce, a mushroom truffle w/ truffle oil , & a pear pecorino. This pear pecorino was heavenly! My husband has the seafood pasta with squid ink pasta. He seemed to like his meal- However, he sampled mine & would have preferred that! Our colleague had the lobster bisque soup which he enjoyed and the Paccheri Amalfitani.  A downside to the experience. The wait staff wanted to CLEAR our table constantly! We were relaxing, enjoying conversation with our business associate during all the stages of our meals. We were interrupted often by the many bussers that where either trying to grab our plates we hadn't finished, taking plates without asking or asking if we were finished when we clearly weren't?! Our butter was swiped off the table before we even got to taste the complementary bread, had to ask for another.To many employees on staff for how unoccupied the room was. Our waiter was fine; with that said, paying for the atmosphere & fancy flare is another. In our observation  it's extremely pricey for the portions & was not as memorable as we would have wished for.",

I just figured he must not have a high respect for women due to his age and accent. Im not going to pick this review all apart but I did like the lady who sold us our bottle of wine and I liked my orange roughie. The balloons on the ceiling looked tacky and would have looked nicer if a curly string was at least attached. It was just a bad valentine decor, bad valet, bad service but great wine.

I sat at the bar which had the football game playing. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable of the items only the menu. Tomaso was in the house as well. Always friendly and comes by to greet the patrons. I was given some warm fresh homemade bread with some of Tomasos own brand of fresh olive oil. By the way it is the best. He makes his own olive oil and various types of wines which are presented in a full stocked bar.   What I like most is he offers more then he typical Italian resturant options and seasonal dishes. There is something for all dietary needs. I have some food allergies and this Resturant will customize your order.   There is a small room for private parties that can be closed off to the patrons. Decorate classy with top notch customer service.",

    "text": "A few friends joined me at the bar last night and we had a very nice experience.  Tomaso was there but spent most of his time watching over the kitchen and serving staff - as he should.  After 40 years he has opened this second location in North Scottsdale.  While we have a handful of other Italian restaurants in close proximity, I can comfortably predict this will become the local favorite.   A few kinks need to be worked out, but that's perfectly understandable being open for just a few days.  We saw a server move the bowl of grated parmesan cheese from one person that just finished his spaghetti to another that just had some arrive.  That's not like a bottle of ketchup and should not be shared amongst customers.  I know fresh grated parmesan reggiano is expensive and shouldn't be wasted - but the server should sprinkle it on the food for the customer and take it away - unless that customer requests to keep it.   Everyone I spoke to loved their food.  His prices are about 10-20% lower than Spiga, Pane e Vino and Gianfranco's nearby.  The only complaint I hear over & over again was his high prices for cocktails.  My rum & coke cost $11.00.  Only nearby Mastro's charges that high a price, but it's a much more generous pour at Mastro's.  Most other high quality restaurants in the area charge between $7-$8 for the same drink.  Tomaso needs to address this because his 30+ seats at the bar will generate at least 20-25% of his business in this part of town if he does it right. Finally, I noticed a few staffers that came from other restaurants in the area.  The waiter John was with Pane e Vino for 15 years.  I stopped going there a few years ago because of the new owner, but missed having John wait on us.  I was sure glad to see him again.  A True professional!  Good luck Tomaso.  We're glad you're here.",

I've had far worse in this state. We ate here in 2014.   I've eaten at a number of Italian restaurants in the Phoenix Metro area, but have decided not to anymore. I grew up in the New York/New Jersey Metro area, and the quality of Italian restaurants in that part of the country, whether a famous  place or a ma and pa hole in the wall, is absolutely outstanding. Arizona has quite a number of Italian eateries that impress people here, but to me, given where I grew up, it's just a disappointment. I love Arizona for a vast number of reasons, but Italian food is not one of them.   I suppose this statement may anger some people in Scottsdale, the West's most Eastern town, but it stands. I have had outstanding Italian food in the Phoenix metro area, but home cooked in people's homes, none of them chefs, and not all of them Italian.",

Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day or any day, this restaurant always amazes me with their menu.  There are many choices and they are never boring.  It is truly a favorite of mine.  If you're a sports nut, you will find many familiar faces at this establishment.",

    "text": "Loved this restaurant. Ate here with co workers one night when it was recommended by a friend that lives in Phoenix. The place is in a strip mall with decent parking but likely easier to valet than self park. But when we walked in it reminded me of an old New York Italian restaurant. The building itself appeared to be quite old and I fully expected to smell that faint smoke smell that you get in those old NYC restaurants. It did not smell like smoke but the ambience was cool. When you first walk in there is a bar in front of you with some seating and a large dining room to the right. We sat at a table for 10 in the dining room. What hit me immediately was our waiter you could tell was a professional. He knew everything on the menu, could comment on how it was all cooked, and gave a lot of suggestions. He was an excellent salesman also. We found out later that night he had worked in Italian restaurants (or this restaurant) for 30 years. We received excellent customer  service the entire night.  The food was excellent also. I can't comment on the entire group but I had homemade pasta and red sauce. My two neighbors had veal and praised it as much as I did my pasta. Really top notch spot that I will return to next time in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Tomaso's has just taken the spot of my number one Italian restaurant this side of San Francisco. I was lucky to have been taken there by my husband a week or so ago for a date night. Tomaso's was booked solid so I was excited he scored a reservation. We decided to arrive a little early and have a glass of wine at the quaint bar. The list is ample with lots of varietals of wines. The bartender was very friendly and accommodating. At our reservation time we were shown to our table. I was surprised how large the restaurant was when our table was in the 'back' of the restaurant. It just seems smaller from the street! Tomaso's is all class with white linen tables and napkins and squared tables. Our waiter greeted us and shared the nights specials: Cioppino and a Veal Chop served Parmigiana style over pasta. Being from the bay area, winning me over with cioppino can be difficult.. so, in truth, I was skeptical. We started with the Charcuterie Antipasto  plate with various Italian salumi; Italian cheeses; olives and amazing grilled artichoke hearts.Our waiter also brought us a basket of house made warm crusty bread and a garlicky basil butter; this was divine. Despite Tomaso's being full on reservations this particular night we were not rushed while we sipped our Super Tuscan wine and nibbled on the charcuterie. The grilled artichokes are knock your socks off good! Finally, after much deliberation, we decided to order. I had to have the Lobster Bisque that was described as having diced lobster within it.. This bisque is heavenly if you like creamy, hearty soups like me. It was rich and filling and full of lobster. On this particular night a Chicken Parmigiana was being served and as much as I wanted to try the Cioppino, (as it was served next to us and it was amazing looking with what looked like an entire lobster tail !), I went with one of my favorites! My husband ordered my second favorite : Maialino Osso Buco. I can't even begin to describe how amazing both dishes were . My meal was very ample in amount and my husband's shank was so tender it was falling off the bone. We both had leftovers to take home! We were so full we did not have desserts and continued to enjoy this very relaxed and mainly, unrushed romantical night out at Tomaso's. I simply was amazed by how great the service was; how we were never rushed on this very popular night ; how awesome the food was and it's presentation, as well. Tomaso's was all I had hoped for on a night out to celebrate a milestone in our relationship with my now husband and they helped make it perfect! I can't wait to return to savor more Italian food here soon!",

You don't have to be super dressed up to come here, but I wouldn't recommend walking in with flip flops and a tank top.  Everything that I tried here was amazing. Even starting with the bread with the herb butter. I could not stop eating it!! It was so good, and the bread stayed warm the entire time we sat there. I order the short rib with the mushroom risotto, while my aunt ordered the caesar and the lasagna. My 7 year old cousin ordered spaghetti and meatballs because well she's 7. Everything we had was so flavorful. The caesar salad is made with the a parmesan shell, so you get that nice bite of crisp cheese.  The short rib was fork tender, there was no need for any knives at this table. The lasagna....OMG perfect mix of tomato, cheese, and meat. This is probably the first time that I can remember in a long time that I didn't need to add salt and pepper to a dish. It was perfectly seasoned from the first bite. The hardest thing I would say here is to decide what you want to eat because everything looks good.   Of course, we had to do a dessert so I had a cannoli, while they shared a bombolini (?) . Whatever they had was great, but it didn't hold a candle to my cannoli with espresso.   I can't leave this review without mentioning that the service from start to finish was amazing. They were very kind, welcoming, and informative. I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Phoenix.",

We really wanted a nice Italian dinner on our last evening in town, and Tomaso's did not disappoint! It's not the trendy American-Italian (which I actually really enjoy) - its more old-school, white tablecloth style. Both are awesome in their own way!  Our server, Arturo, was amazing. He was really helpful with recommendations and we didn't feel rushed at all. We were probably there for over two hours... which is fine by me when doing this style of dining. Our appetizer, Crudo Carpaccio, was a steal at $12 and a great way to start the meal. We each ordered different items with the Osso Buco being the favorite at the table. It was so flavorful and unbelievably tender.   For dessert we had cannoli, profiteroles, and tiramisu - you can't go wrong with any of them. They were all so good!  If you're looking for a traditional Italian spot, check out Tomaso's! We'll be back!",

I couldn't tell you the waiter's name because he never told us.  Although he made a recommendation of one of the daily specials, he barely spoke to us and always seemed to be in a hurry to leave our table to do something else.  We actually had to try to find him to order a second round of drinks and dinner and he never once came back to see how we were doing or if our food was ok.  He didn't come back until we were done and the bus boy had cleared our table.  Truly unacceptible.  I will say the meatball appetizers was great!  They clearly do veal well as there were four or five veal options.  I had veal medallions which were one of the daily specials.  They were extremely tender and great taste.  The potatoes and asparagus were so-so.    Normally we order desert, coffee or after dinner drinks, but opted to get the check and go since the service was lousy.    It was also frustrating this parking lot had one handicapped parking spot right in front of the restaurant (family member in wheelchair) and right were the valet parking attendants stand. I asked if I could park there and the attendant told me he would park the car. A little annoying I have to tip someone to move my car five feet.  And a little surprising the two valet attendants stood there chatting while I got the wheelchair out of the trunk.  We valet the car often and most of the time the attendants help me with the chair, especially when we are dressed for dinner at a descent resteraunt.   To sum it up, good food, but with all the options we have in Phoenix now, we won't waste our time going back to Tomaso's ever again.",

If you enter from the Camelback side you might have to squeeze through a sign and a cement column to get to valet. The interior of the restaurant is ok, seems a bit dated but not too bad. Our experience seemed to be a bit rushed. It felt like as soon as our plates were cleared then next course was on the table. The bread and I assume pesto butter was delightful. The service was OK  but the waiter seemed to rush us and did not really explain any of the menu or tell us the daily vegetable. We had lobster bisque was decent, not the best I've ever had. The dish was so hot that it burned my tongue. For our main dishes, we had the mixed grill and the ribbon pasta with mushroom and truffle. The mixed grill comes with a link of in house made sausage, lamb chops, and a filet. The portions were decent. The waiter neglected to ask me how I would like my filet when I ordered, so it came out well done and the taste of the beef not pleasurable. The best thing by far of the night was the lamb chop. It was seasoned well and cooked to perfection. The sausage link was so-so. My fiancee's dish was interesting. The mushroom-truffle part was tasty, but the ribbon pasta tasted like something from Hamburger Helper. I know they make it in house, but the pasta was not what I was expecting. For dessert, we tried the pistachio cheese cake and caramel chocolate cake. The dishes were respectable but nothing to elevate it from the crowd.",

To our surprise, the  restaurant had a great atmosphere and really authentic  Italian dishes. Even though we arrived quiet late at the restaurant, the staff made us feel very welcome. The waitress provided us with incredible attention and service, with a super friendly approach. She basically helped us decide what would best please our craving for italian cuisine. We are both looking forward to our next visit to arizona and of course to Tomaso's since its italian dishes as well as  service are exceptional.",

We wanted something good to eat and fast food was not going to cut it.  On his first visit here he met a guy who recommended a few places to eat and this was one of them. Wow, great food.  We were under dressed and looking haggard, so we ordered takeout. We had some sides, I know broccoli was one of them for sure and bread was included with the meal. I had the best veal ravioli in a delicious, tasty sauce. Very light, with tomatoes, sage, garlic, onions and possibly veal broth and olive oil and butter. My cleaned off my plate. My bf ordered fettuccine with grilled chicken. Serving size on that was amazing, he didn't finish it all that night, and guess what I had for lunch and dinner the next day, so good even reheated. I would have loved to go again and try the beef carpaccio. Highly recommend it!",

I have never been in a situation where my wishes for two drink coupons per guest was not honored. My company has been willing to purchase two alcoholic beverages per person and any other drinks ordered are from a cash bar purchased by the guest. This restaurant had bottles of wine free flowing without a drink coupon. They actually took over how the alcoholic beverages were dispersed. One waiter even told a staff member, \"don't worry about it, your company is paying \". Unfortunately, it was a family member not someone that felt like that was a positive thing.  Very poor management of my contract and wishes for 40 people.",

We called this restaurant when they were scheduled to close in a half hour, but when we expressed how excited we were to enjoy a meal there the manager agreed to stay open until we had finished.   Upon arrival the door was held open and we were warmly greeted and seated amongst a few other late night diners who were finishing up. The waiter had just finished rowing his gondola from Venice, his accent thick like a finely formulated Bolognese sauce. He delivered the fine red wine we ordered like a master sommelier and took our requests for appetizers patiently. La vita bella!  After we sampled four of their finest appetizers (which were all prepared to perfection), we decided it was time to move into the main course. There were many different dishes ordered: seafood diablo pasta, grilled fish, steak, lobster tail, shrimp, lamb, sea scallops! Everything was cooked with an excellence that could only be matched by the almighty himself. I enjoyed the Tuscan Mixed Grill, which itself was one of the greatest dishes I've ever had. I did, in the tradition of Italian family-style dining, HAVE to try a little bit of everything though...  Topped off with a little dessert dessert wine, this meal could not have been served or prepared better. Tomaso's is a great place to go if you want to get the best Italian food possible.",

This place is in the Biltmore area in the same strip mall (strip mall in Phoenix? Shocking!) as Sportsman and Tarbell's which leads to my only complaint--parking.  There is a free valet (tip them you cheapskates) so that problem is partially mitigated.  This place is a real throw back. The waiters are all pro's and have thick Italian accents.  The garlic butter offered with bread is out of this world so even though it's green and strange looking, enjoy it.  I was craving simple spaghetti and meatballs--it's not on the menu but they'll do it for you if you ask nicely.  Coupled with a few Morettis (decent Italian beer) it was a great experience. One place I recommend with confidence and will return to at the earliest opportunity.",

And it was much more than I was expecting to spend - all together $50+ for a glass of wine, a salad, and pasta.    I should have known when I pulled up to the place, which looked like a closed-up men's club.  I think I was one of the few women in the place and certainly the youngest person in the room.  Most tables seemed full of older couples and older men doing power dinners.  I think I confused the wait staff, walking in by myself (I was in Phoenix on a business trip and craving pasta).  I scanned the menu, hoping for something light and fresh...which was a no go.  I ended up ordering a special, black linguine with seafood.  The linguine itself (and the sauce) was actually pretty tasty.  However the amount of seafood was overwhelming and I had to dig out the pasta.  The salad was okay - a Caesar served in a parmesan shell, which was a nice touch.  Overall,  I would give Tomaso's 2.5 stars.  The service was great (although my waiter seemed unsure what to do with a single woman at his table) but the food was only so-so for the amount of money I spent.  Like I said, disappointing.",

The waiter forgot to bring the oil until much later in the meal. The service was good in this place and really fast. I think it was the quickest meal I have ever had. We started out with the calamari. It was very bland and could have used one more minute in the fryer but the marinara sauce that came with it was great! The salad bianco was really good. The dressing was super lemony. I loved it. My main dish was ok. I got the special which was homemade penne ala vodka with langastino shrimp. It was ok. It didn't rock my world.

Meanwhile, I was working on my $28 kobe ravioli, which consisted of 4, count them 4 raviolis... yeah, definitely not gonna cut it. The service is ok, but there are issues now and then with small irrelevent things. They have a very old clientele from the area that I just get the feeling have been frequenting the restaurant for a very long time, and wont dare change what they order. That being said, they don't want anything to change from the menu to the ambiance, to the staff that works there. The whole staff is Italian, and they know how to cook pretty well, but I can't shake that feeling that I'm about 40 years too young to be there, and the portions are just way too small.  +1 for great wine list +1 for homemade pasta -1 for the old people atmosphere.",

It had not been pounded thin.This is the best Italian I've had in the valley in over 10 years. And trust me we have tried many Italian restaurants, especially having a brother-in-law from Italy. Even he agreed! Ended with the cannoli. Do not skip dessert. Be sure to save room!",

The zucchini and caprese appetizer was equally as good. To end the meal we had the tiramisu was so good. You never know what you can get with tiramisu but it was the real deal. Gino was a fantastic host to boot. I highly recommended stopping by. Tomaso's will not disappoint!",

    "text": "5/7/19 - I wish I could grant this establishment more stars but we had such a terrible experience tonight.  I know this may not affect anyone's desire to visit this restaurant as it seems to be a very busy place with a good number of regulars.  We happened to be on that side of town and I looked on their website and saw they had Happy Hour until 6:30.  When we arrived, we verified with the staff at the host stand if happy hour was still in effect and she said it was at the bar.  We sat down at the bar which was empty at the time.  The bartender approached and I asked if he had the happy hour menu.  He said happy hour was over at 6.  He showed us a menu and pointed at the time.  I told him the hours on the website were different and he just shrugged his shoulders and said it was 6.  He then left us to tend to the service bar.  I'll just say, he was very unfriendly from the get go.  I pulled up the website on my phone just to be certain I did not make a mistake and when he finally came back to us after serving up a few drinks at the service bar, I showed him the website.  Again, he just said happy hour was over at 6.  I asked if he could honor the happy hour because of the website and the fact that we came there for that reason.   He said no because the kitchen would not allow it because it was getting busy; he pointed to the direction of the dining area.  I do not like to do this, but I asked if he could see if the manager would honor it since it was a discrepancy on the website. He shrugged his shoulders again and went to get the manager.  The manager turned out to be the person who greeted us a the door when we first walked in and told us that happy hour was still in effect.  She, of course, honored the happy hour price for us.  She was very professional and polite and came around to ask if everything was okay when we ordered food.  The bartender continued to be very unfriendly to us and he never asked if everything was okay.  We felt very uncomfortable during the entire experience and we did not dare order another drink as we seemed to be a bother to him.  Other patrons sat around us at the bar and he was very friendly and attentive to them.      Additionally, as my dinner guest finished her wine, there was a huge sludge of sediment at the bottom of her glass.  We tried to get his attention but he went about tending to other duties and we did not feel like sticking around.  In hindsight, I should have taken a photo and we understand that wine will do that, but still , it was just salt on the wound. After we left, I called the restaurant to get the bartender's name, but I think he answered.  When he answered the phone, it was hard to understand his greeting.  I apologized that I had the wrong number and he just hung up ... again, very unfriendly.  It had been ages since I dined at Tomaso's and my guest had never been there.  With plenty of other great authentic Italian restaurants, this is one we will not make an effort to return.  I understand this was just happy hour, but this one was certainly not happy by any stretch.",

His personality was warm and welcoming. Upon arrival, the happy feeling continued, as he greeted us by name and personally walked us back to the perfect table for our party, which included our 3 year old. Our server Aaron took over and proceeded with the impressive service and recommended the perfect dishes and right amount of food for us to be completely full and take no leftovers, as we have someplace to go after. The veal and filet mignon bolognese and the lemon veal scaloppine were amazing and we will definitely come back to try the rest of the delicious looking menu.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I dined on Thursday 2/28 for our anniversary. We were extremely underwhelmed and it was very disappointing.  The evening started ok, except we didn't get menus when we were sat. The host had them then walked away. She didn't even say, \"ok I'll be right back with better menus\" or something.... So, after we waited a couple minutes, my boyfriend got up and the other host said, wow give us a minute*jokingly* but it wasn't funny, we knew what she meant. But sitting without menus we couldn't even get started. Then everything slowly went down hill. Our waiter brought me a sample of wine that he thought I would like. It was good and I ordered a bottle. It was opened when he got to the table and he said he just opened it to get the sample. Shouldn't that be a \"by the glass\" bottle (because it was offered by the glass as well) and then do a proper wine service at the table? He poured generous, which is fine, but when I went to pour another glass, the bottle was empty! The waiter did not come and top our wine off at all, so it was literally just the initial 2 glasses poured, so was that even a full bottle? 2 glasses and it's empty? We'll never know since the bottle was opened before it got to the table.   The kitchen clearly crashed. 45-50 minutes for the scallop appetizer, which was ok. Another 45-50 minutes, at least, for dinner. I could see guests around me getting frustrated as well. I think we were told 5 times, \"Your food will be right out, just a couple more minutes.\" Our waiter brought us 2 glasses of wine on the house for our food taking so long. Or was it the 2 glasses we didn't get with our bottle? Who knows. The food was good. I liked mine more than my boyfriend liked his. He thought his food was way over cooked. Not great for having to wait as long as we did.  Our waiter was hard to find towards the end, so my boyfriend put his card on the table. He ran his card and when he returned it there was no itemized receipt. As someone in the industry, that made me so mad!  As a whole, the experience did not compete with my expectations. It was a very upsetting anniversary dinner.",

Since it was part of Arizona Restaurant Week, I was reminded to finally try it.  In summary, the food was solidly good, the service was impeccable, and the ambiance was quiet but not stuffy.   I had the stuffed zucchini flower for the appetizer and it was perfectly fried and very tasty. The sole piccata was flaky tender and had just the right amount of caper sauce. I was also pleased that the vegetables were not over cooked. The tiramisu was light and had a good amount of cocoa powder but wasn't too heavy.   I definitely recommend Tomaso's for fancier events -- it is not chasing trends but just providing a great service-oriented product that has allowed it to be in business for 41 years.",

We will never be back.  After reading several other reviews, the POOR and SLOW service seems to be a trend. Melissa seems to respond to all of these with the same state of shock and surprise. I see her email address is part of the Maggiore group. I see this means we also need to avoid Hash and the Sicilian Butcher. As a piece of advice, when running multiple restaurants as part of a group with your namesake-- fix a problem when you get MULTIPLE REPEAT reviews all saying the same thing!",

For those that are connoisseurs of Italian food, you know that with the possible exception of New York City, there is simply no better place in the country for Italian in terms of volume of choices and quality of food.  Demographically, CT has one of the highest percentages of Italians in the country (18%... second only to Rhode Island)  Wooster St. in New Haven is a must. (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FAttraction_Review-g33851-d1145360-Reviews-Little_Italy-New_Haven_Connecticut.html&s=dac767bf2c40b272f2fbeeb4540bfb3afb45af16c7847017af2cfb1321a7d0b5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/Attracti...</a>)  With all that said, Tomaso's rivals the quality of food and service that I would get at Wooster St. The Veal Saltimbocca is my \"main stay\" and the wine list features the best of Italian wine imports.  The portion sizes are perfect, enough to fill you but not overwhelming.  If you get one of the desserts (which would be the only thing that is not top-notch on the menu)you will leave full.   The service is excellent... all of the servers have been there for many years and know the menu inside and out.  The are excellent with new people unfamiliar with Italian food or wine pairings.    Lets be honest... Arizona is a desert in more ways than one... it has to have the worst ethnic food in the country with the exception of Mexican.  It is filled with Chain Food that people have convinced themselves is good. Olive Garden, China King, Carrabas etc. etc. I have not been to an Italian restaurant, or any restaurant, for that matter in AZ that even comes close to this place.",

I rated it a 1 because I was charged an additional amount on my card then what my bill actually was. This is a sneaky trick waiters do to see if they can get away with getting extra tips with hopes you will not check your bank statement, will not want the hassle of disputing with your bank, or not recall the amount charged and accept it for what it is.  This is dishonest and unacceptable; dishonesty is never the way to go. The service was exceptional up to being charged an additional $30 dollars after already including a 25% tip. Our total bill was 196, we left 50 in cash in the bill sleeve. 196 x 25% = 49. We were not a large party, there were only three of us, so an added gratuity would not be assessed. After putting zero on the credit card slip, and writing cash near tip on the receipt. I was then days later charged an additional 30 dollars. That is an 80 dollar tip for a dishonest waiter; albeit the service was great it was not worth almost 50 percent. I loved the food and family feel but will not be going back due to the business practices. I understand you are in the business of making money, but not at the \"added\" expense of the customer. It's not the money, it's the principle.",

I have always heard great things about Tomaso's but had no idea it would be this good!   We started off the meal with a shrimp appetizer - the shrimp was sauteed in a lemon caper butter sauce and tasted so good.   Then we ordered our lunch entree -  rigatoni Amatrciana and veal parmiggiano.  The pasta was cooked to perfection, sauce was amazing and the veal was so tender it practically melted in my mouth.  We even decided to splurge on dessert - a wild berry tart which was light and delicious - perfect with an espresso.  If this is what lunch is like at Tomaso's, I can hardly wait to check it out for dinner!  Definitely my new favorite Italian restaurant!  Tomaso's is perfect for a business lunch and I know it will be the perfect date night dinner spot.  The wait staff in the restaurant was very attentive to our needs and made sure we were well taken care of without being overbearing.   Tomaso even came out and introduced himself and asked how everything was which has never happened to me before. I can't wait to come back - very highly recommended!",

    "text": "Tomaso Maggiore, Has run Tomaso's for 35 years, since 1977,  this well know (voted best Italian Phoenix yearly) restaurant on the Camelback corridor has the goods.  You can find great Tuscan or Sicilian wines. The food is fantastic. During our meal this evening with a AZ Restaurant week pri fix menu we had the Burrata & Dates as well as the Pasta Pillows drown in a sage butter sauce. For the Entree we had the Sweet potato gnocchi and stuffed veal. Dessert we had the tiramisu and chocolate crunch cake. The food was perfectly cooked. Often gnocchi can be over cooked, gluten chewy. Ours was perfect.  The veal was stuffed with cheese, accompanied with a mushroom demi glaze which was so awesome.  All was delicious! Our bottle of wine with dinner was the Super Sicilian Luxus 5. Tomaso, On one of his many trips to Sicily, he met by chance Giovanni Maggio, who shared the same dream. In 1994 in Agrigento Sicily, a vineyard of 150 acres was born featuring wines with the bold, natural flavors of the land, and a complexity that ensured its success. Maggiore's Luxus 5 Meritage is a blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Nero D'avola, 13% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot and 7% Syrah.  A dry, medium intensity. The flavors are quite complex and include red cherries, red plums, vanilla, black pepper, clove and liquorice. The service was great, it pays to have employees with longevity who are dedicated to the task. Here are some facts from Tomaso's web site that makes you appreciate him even more: Tomaso's opened its doors on September 10, 1977 at 3:59PM Tomaso's has served over 10 million locals & visitors over the past 35 years Hundreds of thousands of Arizona residents have celebrated their birthdays, anniversaries, first dates and even weddings at Tomaso's. Tomaso's has supported 100s of local non-profits, schools and charities. Year after year, Tomaso's has been voted the Best Italian Restaurant in Arizona. Over the past 35 years, Tomaso's has provided employment for 1000s of Arizonans.  Many of our past team members have gone on to become successful  restauranteurs, lawyers, doctors, business and community leaders. At Tomaso's, the best is yet to come!",

I also felt pressured to order appetizers and desert when I wasn't hungry enough to want those. Go to North if you're looking for great Italian good and great service.",

The appetizer we wanted was no longer on the menu, as Tomaso likes to change the menu regularly, but we asked for it anyway and our request was happily granted. We ordered a bottle of Tomaso's own red wine, Luxur 2004, fabulous! Our appetizer was lemon caper shrimp. Filet mignon was perfection, and for dessert we had fudge truffles. I asked for strawberries with the truffles and again, wish granted with zero hesitation. Everything was perfect as always. I wouldn't bring a girl here on a first date cuz it's a bit spendy for a girl that has no guarantee, but the place definitely drops panties.",

We were walked through the entire restaurant into their sister restaurant. We were told there were so many reservations they had to open up the other restaurant. They sat our party of 4 at a small hi top bar table. They said that's all they had.  During our entire meal they kept trying to sit people at these hi tops and people kept complaining.    Our service was good and the food was good.  We had the linguini seafood which was good, but lacked that flavor.  Another person had the filet ravioli. It tasted like a meat sauce on top of the ravioli, but was good. The two others had the eggplant. My wife liked it and thought it was delicious.    Overall I would say good food, but I would probably not make a trip from Gilbert again.",

    "text": "I wanted to take my boyfriend out to a nice Italian restaurant for his birthday rather than doing a steakhouse. I got a recommendation from a coworker to try Tomaso's and I was excited to try a new Italian restaurant that wasn't Olive Garden.  The parking lot was small and we had no choice but to do the complimentary valet.  I'm not a big fan of valeting my car because I've had things stolen from my car before and then I feel obligated to tip.  The atmosphere inside is really nice and cozy and has a romantic feel to it.  The menu items sounded amazing but I was actually pretty disappointed when we got our meal.  Before going out to dinner, I had scoped out the menu online and decided on what I wanted to eat which was the \"scampi and risotto\".  The description of this dish was \"Grilled Giant Prawns with Garlic Scented EVOO; Served with Seafood Medley Risotto\" and I was expecting giant prawns and what I got were 4 little prawns with risotto that wasn't cooked all the way and the rice was hard and dry.  I was really disappointed and I really wanted to like the food but it just wasn't what I expected at all, especially for a high priced dish.  The bread and butter they give you before your meal was delicious.  The bread was warm and fresh and the butter was good.  My boyfriend ordered Sea Scallops, Blue Lump Crab, Scampi & Nero di Seppia all'Arrabbiata and he said it was ok but the sauce seemed bland but the seafood seemed to be a generous amount.  The service I will say was exceptional.  They filled our waters and was very attentive.  When I made the reservations to the restaurant, I noted that it was my boyfriends birthday and during dinner, the owner came by and wished him a happy birthday.  When we finished our meal, without even asking the server, the manager and three other servers came with a piece of cake and lit candle and sang him happy birthday.  It was great to see that their service was on point but as far as their food, it's nothing to rave about. I probably won't be back anytime soon.",

So I ordered a medley to different things so I could try out different menu items.  The salad was very good with the pistachos.  The bread and butter was even a wow factor.  The place was very nicely lit and amazing wait staff.  Geno waited on us amazing they way he spoke to us, he treated us like royalty.  The tables had white linen cloths on them, very upscale establishment and not at all noisy you were able to have a conversation without yelling.  We ordered the wild caught pistachio salmon which was very good, the seafood pasta with sea bass amazing and the trio of fist size raviolli's  The butternut squash homemade raviolli was amazing.  Very nice atmosphere, great wait staff, nice ambience everything you would want in a upscale restaurant.  Plus the melt in your mouth Filet is always an added advantage!!! Yum Yum Good!!!!",

    "text": "Just visited Tomaso's for the first time, and regret that I hadn't dined there sooner!  The tiny parking lot has free valet parking which made entry and exit very easy. Yes, my party tipped -it was hot outside!  My party arrived at 5:30, which is early, and there were just a few tables seated. As our meal progressed, the place filled to capacity and we dined on a weeknight.  We were greeted at the door with genuine warmth by several employees and were quickly taken to a table by our server. Our server was very warm, patient and gracious. Other servers kept our drinks filled and plates removed quickly and efficiently. Every need was filled immediately.  The herb butter and fresh bread were perfect. The bread was warm, chewy inside and crispy outside.  The salad with pears and gorgonzola was served in a baked parmesean bowl and featured slices of fresh bartlett pears, gorgonzola cheese, candied nuts and a house made vinaigrette. It was crisp and delicious, with a nice contrast of tart, sweet, nutty and cheesy.  The hazelnut risotto was delicious, as was the past trio. Please note that the pasta and risotto dishes are modest in size, and designed to be one course in a meal. These are not huge heaping plates. They are artful servings of great handcrafted food. Traditionally, one spends a lot of time at an Italian meal, so, courses are reasonably sized.  The pasta trio was just right for my mother who is a senior citizen and eats modest portions. She had a salad and the pasta and was very happy.  The Osso Bucco was delicious! The portion was very large and I wound up sharing partly because it was so good, but, also because it was a big plate of food. It was served in a sauce with chunky vegetables and plated on mushroom risotto.  We enjoyed the house Chianti and it was a perfect complement to the meal. Coffees were fresh and very good. We did not have dessert because we were stuffed!  Overall, this was a very solidly great dining experience; a perfect example of the best Italian fine dining.",

We went there last night for a special night's dinner; my husband had the Alaskan Halibut with Lobster Ravioli and I had the Alaskan Halibut with Blue Crab over Squid Ink Pasta: the halibut was over cooked and dry for both dishes, the blue crab tasted like it was from a can, and the sauce for my dish tasted like it was from a jar. The squid ink pasta was under cooked, less than al dente. They served regular tap water. The server was distracted, inattentive, and never checked to see how we enjoyed the meal. The temperature of the restaurant was too low, myself and other guests were freezing.  Two things that were good: the lobster ravioli were excellent and the manager tried to adjust the temperature. Needless to say, we were more than a little disappointed! We expected more from a restaurant that charges these kinds of prices! Keep your money, go somewhere else, this place isn't worth it!!  We probably should have tried Tarbells in the same strip mall.",

You have to park in an awkward lot arranged so that you have to turn out and then back in before you find the Valet. Our waiter vacillated between hovering at the hostess station while staring at us to ignoring us completely. The salad turned out to be canned pears atop wilted lettuce with an odd topping of fried onion strings. The pasta was good, but not worth the $20 asking price. The dessert and coffee were served with no spoons, so we were forced to go foraging for extra silverware at a neighboring empty table. Finally, we had to wait at least five minutes at the valet station for the attendant to arrive back from his break.   On a Saturday night the restaurant was more than half empty, so the waiter really had no excuse. Luckily, his counterpart who was serving the next table over took pity on us and refilled our bread basket and water glasses, offered us fresh ground pepper for our appetizer, and  answered our questions about the dishes our own waiter had abruptly plunked down in front of us before bolting back to the hostess station.   While the experience here gave us a lot to laugh about, we will not be returning to Tomaso's.",

From the moment you walk in the door until the time you waddle out, stuffed to the gills, you are reseated as family.   Visited with my family and had the best meal of the week. Started with fried calamari and carpaccio. Both were perfection. Main courses included a lamb shank, prawns & fettuccine, seafood gnocchi and a knock-out mushroom & corn busiati dish. The sauce on the busiati was the richest mushroom flavor I've ever tasted.  All the dishes were cooked with love.   The manhattans were stand-out drinks.   Get yourself here post haste for a lovely evening.",

I was in the mood for a nice Italian meal and was not disappointed.  This establishment has an old-school look and feel - in a very classy way. It provides for a formal, upscale experience (despite casual attar being perfectly acceptable).   The wait-staff was personable, professional and extremely helpful. We started with wine. Our selection was a Cabernet Sauvignon  - Frog's Leap from Napa Valley. As always, absolutely delicious.  Then we enjoyed carpaccio, czar salad and a bone-in veal parmigiana. The carpaccio consisted of tasty and tender, thinly sliced beef tenderloin accompanied by arugula, capers and parmigiana shavings. The czar salad was supplemented by a parmigiano basket that added just the right flavor and crunch. The veal portion was enormous ... a meal in and of itself which was backed up with asparagus and potatoes.  This meal, while not inexpensive ...... was memorable. I shall return.",

We felt very pampered.  The food was about the best Italian we've had. My husband is picky and loved the lasagna. It was the best we've had.  They also make their own wine that is more affordable ($56 for a bottle) that was very good.  Price is what to expect for a nice Italian place.  Family of 4 we had appetizers, unlimited bread, 4 dinners, 2 desserts and a bottle of wine for $212.  We will definitely be back!",

Next to my old gym and another great restaurant, it is a historic spot that continues to charm.   Service is spectacular and I could not gush enough about their staff. Apparently, the bottles of wine we drank also made me forget my server's name. He was uh-mazing and spoiled my girlfriends and I when we came to celebrate my home purchase. It's quaint, yet sophisticated enough for your discerning palate. The bar is intimate and welcoming if you rather sit alone or meet some wonderful patrons. While we wanted to start off with cocktails, we ended up ordering bottles of their unique wine the Monte Olimpo Cabernet Sauvignon/Nero D' Avola. If you want to be transported to Italy, you have to partake in the vino correct?!! As I have said before, a glass of wine is a lie. You know you will drink the whole bottle, or two or more in our case. I highly recommend it as it paired really well with everything on the menu my little appetite could devour.   My favorite dish is the Michaelangelo and befittingly so named as this dish was a beautiful marriage of veal, beef and carbs. If you can't get enough, ask for more bread and slather that rosemary butter for an extra kick of goodness. I am especially appreciative that Tomaso's was accommodating to my vegan friend. Naturally, we finished with several desserts such as the tiramisu. The Angel Kiss is a lover's kiss on your lips. Trust me, it will leave you wanting more. Occasionally, they have wine dinner nights where you can sample their specialties with wine pairings. I encourage you to come, sip awhile and dine often to enjoy Sicily here in the valley.",

Since I was flying solo, I sat at the bar. Anthony the bartender was very attentive, made a killer Manhattan and also gave me a great wine recommendation. The veal roulade with ravioli was outstanding. I'm really looking forward to returning for some of the other menu items that sound equally mouth-watering.   But in addition to the food being great, I was really impressed with how Anthony and Gino made me feel at home - treatment that you might expect a regular to receive, but I was a first-timer! So I really appreciated the friendliness and the great customer service!   Grazie, Tomaso's!!! See you again soon!",

    "text": "Went there last night for Valentine's Day.  I am thinking the tip off to it not being good is the fact we could get reservations when I called the evening prior.   I asked for a 6:30 reservation, and I was given the options of 6:15 or 6:45.   I picked the 6:45, got there early, and we didn't have to wait.  In fact, there were empty tables. ...  Oscar was our server.   Nice guy.  Professional.  The thing I saw that was a bit disturbing is the fact that when he opened a bottle of wine at a table close to us, the top of the foil fell to the floor.   He kicked it under the table.   Huhhh??  Is that what servers do?    Also, another table next to us had a folded napkin under one of the legs.   I would imagine to keep it from wobbling.  I would think, if they are going to do that how about a less conspicuous color since it readily stood out.  On to my meal.   I ordered the house salad.   I was thinking I should have ordered the dressing on the side.   I mean, it wasn't bad but there was so much that it made me cough -- maybe cause of the vinegar? -- and was completely saturated!  I think I was having salad in my dressing. ...   My table mate had the caesar's salad.   I am thinking I should have ordered that.  I ordered their Silver Oak cab, which is a 2013.   Not a bad bottle of wine.   I looked it up at Total Wine to see what the markup is.  Not bad.  A nice heavy body wine.  We perused the menu.   He decided to get the RIGATONI WITH VEAL & FILET MIGNON BOLOGNESE and I got their special, which I think is similar to the LINGUINE AMALFITANI.   It had all kinds of shell fish: shrimp, lobster, clams, mussels.  I can't remember what else.  I tasted his.   He didn't particularly care for it and neither did I.   It sort of looked like a bad version of spaghetti with meat sauce, and the taste was, well, interesting. ...   I thought not at all palatable.   And I mean it.  My dish, I think had the same sauce.   I concentrated on eating the shell fish.  The shrimp was tough as was the lobster.  Cooked a bit too long??  Thankfully, it didn't have much of the sauce.  He is Sicilian; therefore, I asked if he would return.   He said no.  He would like to give them the benefit of the doubt and say maybe they were busier than normal cause of it being Valentine's Day.   Uhmmmm.   No.",

Though our table sat down first, we were the last of the three tables that our waiter visited. Even when he was finally at our table, he was clearly not appreciative that we wanted to put in our drink and appetizer order. We asked him to please put the order in as we were starving. He still did not and I watched him walk around the restaurant chatting with tables. When the appetizers were finally brought, he'd forgotten the pear salad. After I said something, he apologized and put in the order for the pear salad. We asked for some olive oil to have with the bread and he brought red pepper and another condiment and said he couldn't find the olive oil. Eventually he found it and brought it over. The food was quite good. Later, he brought out an espresso in a giant cup. The busser remade it for my husband and put it in an espresso cup. When my brother asked the waiter for an espresso too - he was also given his tiny espresso in a giant cup. The busser was great btw - super attentive regarding the waters and bread and dishes. With the espressos, the waiter brought a broken glass container with the sugars, etc.. We had to search again for our  waiter to get the bill. Food was good but service was way off for the $300+ bill for a party of 4. There was live music.",

We did not have a good experience last night. The four of us were placed at a table for 2. We waited 10-15 minutes before anyone came to offer us water, drinks, bread or a menu. Our waiter was rude. He barely had time to talk about the menu or offer his suggestions. We had to ask for bread and additional drinks. The wrong soup was delivered. When the second bowl arrived it was cold. Our entrees were not hot and the fish did not smell fresh.When our entrees were served, we had to ask if they could remove the 1st course plates. When we finally had to ask for the bill, the waiter shook his head in disgust.  We heard that this was the first year Tomaso's was open on Christmas day. I don't think they were prepared for the volume of business, but I would think the number of reservations would be an indication. They have been in business long enough to know. The owner was hanging in the lobby the entire evening and never looked around at the tables to see if anything was needed. Needless to say, it was NOT a good experience.",

Although our waiter was not Italian (I believe he was South American), he was pretty good.  I think he tried to give our large group time to chat so it was nice not to be rushed (which seemed very European).  The meals served were beautiful, but I don't think any of us thought the food was that amazing (we also ate at the Capital Grille and Frank & Albert's-see those reviews-and really enjoyed the food).  I thought the restaurant had priced its menu well for the ambiance and plates served.  I would not be opposed to returning, but there are other better options in the area.",

They politely told us to come on by. The host was so friendly and had the best sense of humor. He joked around with us but remained professional. Our server was awesome. He was friendly and didn't seem agitated that we got there later than we would have liked to. He served us in a timely manner and gave us just the right amount of space. I had the chicken parmigiana. It was the best I have ever had. Toward the end of the night they were cleaning off tables for closing but they assured us to take our time and that there was no rush. I really appreciated that. My dining buddy had to use the rest room so I waited and spoke to the bartender who recommended dishes to try the next time we came in. It was an all-around awesome experience and the staff was not only friendly and personable but they made us feel at ease even though I felt so bad about coming in close to their closing time. I would recommend them to all my friends.",

They are one of the few places in town willing to cater to you, even creating special dishes. I want give a huge thank you to the kitchen, Robin and entire staff for going above and beyond on our to go order Tuesday evening. They specially made several dishes for us. They even made my favorite gnocchi, which I hadn't had in a couple years. Spinach ricotta stuffed gnocchi in a Truffle pistachio sauce, I could eat that dish everyday. The veal chop was excellent, as well as the Veal Parm. The trio of ravioli and lobster ravioli were outstanding. We really enjoyed the delicious surf and turf creation. Desserts were excellent as always. Thank you so much, we absolutely adore this place!!!",

If you like to feel like you just discovered a gem in Sicily for the first time, definitely come to Tomaso's.  It's nice enough to celebrate Valentine's Day or an Anniversary here, but also cool enough to go with a group of guys to get some drinks and eat for a few hours ... Yes, you can literally spend hours here eating and drinking. They always make you feel like family.   Jason",

    "text": "A rehearsal dinner I went to was hosted here this past weekend - I have to say overall I was impressed with the place. Italian food in the middle of the desert seemed like a questionable choice to me, but I remained with an open mind, open and mostly dehydrated...  The party of 30(+/-?) arrived with a fairly good clip, there were a few stragglers, and a few people who were there before the main group of us. We were all graciously welcomed and directed to the back/function room.   The waiters were (THANKFULLY) quick to replenish all of our water glasses as soon as we emptied them, and since we are from a way different climate, we went through a TON of water even before everybody else had arrived.   I had forgotten to mention in my rsvp that I had a nut allergy, and when I looked at the place setting and noted the included menu had an almond dessert the waiter was very good to work with me and get me something that I could eat - three flavors of gelato, very tasty.   The pasta dish was fusilli carbonara, which is one of my favorite dishes (to make at home, and to order) and they did pretty well with it, I have to say, I've seen some places mess it up royally, but this had a good balance and when I got some extra grated cheese from our waiter, it gave it a little bit more of a \"bite\" or \"kick\" that it was looking for to really fill out the flavor. If it had been homemade fusilli, Tomaso would have won my heart!  There was some confusion or miscommunication between the waiters, us about wither or not wine was *part* of the meal, or if it was by the glass, and added to a tab for our table. Regardless, it was good wine, and I'm glad I had it for my meal, it was a small price (confusion, and in dollars) to have a nice glass of wine to compliment my chicken, and everybody else's steak.   The service was excellent, they catered to our every need, and assisted even the more bizarre requests. The one thing that could make this private function room THAT much more functional, in my mind is a bathroom that is closer than the polar opposite side of the restaurant.   If I ever find myself back in this part of the world, I'll try to make it back and try some of their other dishes - and hopefully be better prepared for the heat!",

The restaurant reminds me of old Hollywood- kind of glamorous and classy. The waiters are dressed in crisp white shirts with ties. Our waiter was very Italian and very gracious. Nicely set tables, great ambiance, and great art on the walls. We ordered several different things and please forgive my spelling of some of these dishes. If you look at their menu you'll be able to figure it out. I had the lobster bisque, 2 had the minestrone soup and one had a beautiful salad- all were excellent. The Asso bucco (sp?), eggplant Parmesan and lasagne were all first rate. I had a noodle dish with prosciutto that was fabulous. We had tiramisu and a nonna cake thing that were amazing- especially the tiramisu. A little spendy- probably someplace for celebrations- but great value, service and food.",

Tomaso's gets his seafood from Santa Monica Seafoods, who has a high-level reputation for quality and sustainability.

It had no pasta, which is unusual for a wedding soup. Instead, diced white meat chicken took its place next to traditional and delicious little meatballs.  I came specifically for the zucchini blossoms, and they didn't disappoint! Beautiful, tasty, even the stems! Though I think they could have used a bit more salt. And after all that, I forgot to take their photo!  The shrimp on the shrimp and lobster ravioli was amazing!! Very meaty, no fishy flavor whatsoever, and the lemon sauce was perfect! The ravioli had a clear clean lobster flavor and perfect tooth bite.  #eatARW",

After my arrival, the place filled quickly; ranging from couples to eight member parties. Noise was at a minimal.  I began my dining experience by having a glass of resieling as I admired  the artwork, lighting, furniture, etc. and soaked up my surroundings. I noticed that every occupied table had a bottle of wine on it... except mine.  Meal options: I chose to start with the Fiori di Zucca - stuffed zucchini blossom with organic ricotta, basil & mozzarella. Talk about a treat for your palate! For an entree, I chose the Menage a Trois -  lobster, scallops, and shrimp in a savory fresh tomato sauce, olives & basil; served on linguine. Yum. Yum!  Everything was on point and served in a timely fashion.  I was please with the entire experience. I recommend Tomaso's for special occasions or for those that missing True authentic Italian food.",

I had not had lobster that I have liked since we went on our trip to the Breakers and that was a 5 star restaurant and you are walking away with a $600 bill. Tomaso's was very reasonably priced and their food was 5 stars! I will definitely be back",

    "text": "Sadly, I did not find this place to be as tasty as I hoped or for the prices either.    However, I thought it was going to be uber good because of menu choices and descriptions...and the prices.  But prices lie sometimes...or a lot!  Oh and perhaps because their pesto butter that they give with their bread basket was yuuuuuuuuuumy!    We went for a friend's birthday dinner and so we shared the fried mozarella balls with anchovy sauce and capers.  Now that was tasty!    I got the filet mignon ravioli with veal demi sauce, aromatic vegetables, truffle, and parmaggiano.  Sigh.  The raviolis were good, but I was expecting parmaggiano melted on top and more of a taste variety.  The first few bites were tasty, but I quickly became bored with it.  I did nosh on my friend's seafood ravioli (which were pretty good since it had a cream sauce) and a bit of another friend's veal.  I've had mouth-watering melt-in-your-mouth veal in Sorrento, Italy...so that is what I was hoping for and expecting.  Not so much. See my attached photo...there certainly isn't much to it, very 2-dimensional.    This one was a definitely let down for sure.  And for the pricetag, I'm not happy to not have enjoyed it more.  There seems to be a very old crowd here as well.    Our server was very friendly and helpful as well.  I was afraid not to finish off my last ravioli though, even though I was full, because he would give us a hard time if we didn't finish things on our plate.  Gotta love Europeans!  I remember that happening often when I traveled all over Europe awhile back.  LOL",

Of the five items my husband and I ordered, two were prepared specially for me (oh my, the gnocchi with meat sauce was pure heaven). Our server was knowledgeable, courteous, and funny. We had such a pleasant experience. My only regrets are that I did not ask our server's name and I didn't leave room for dessert!",

But I can share with you the \"silver lining\" to this dreary day: The House Made Sicilian Sausage ~ The most flavorful sausage served with a sauteed mixture of bell peppers, onions & pine nuts all in this wonderful, hearty, robust glaze!!!

We were disappointed with the choice made by the hostess to seat us at the last two top by the rear door. Worst table in the resto. We were entertained by the staff hanging in the service alcove by our table grumbling lol. Our waiter was clearly not their best. We observed other waiters who were polished pro's and wished we were enjoying their service. Cocktails were generous, wines by the glass, so so.  The Capresi appetizer is terrific with Heirloom Tomatoes that were very tasty. I had the veal chop saltimboca and it was terrific, if too much food. My partner had the lobster and seafood pasta and it was very very good. All in all I would say there are other choices that I would make before a return visit, and if I return I will insist on a central table and a better waiter.",

    "text": "I'm so disappointed with the service here. We made a reservation through Yelp for 8pm last night, and when we got there the hostess promptly seated us. However, the room they sat us in was extremely cold, and I'm a baby when it comes to cold, so my boyfriend went back to the hostess to ask if we could get another table. She told him we'd have to wait 10-15 minutes, which we were fine with, so we headed to the bar to sit and wait.  About 30 seconds later, the hostess came back and said she had another table for us. We thought this was awesome since we were expecting to have to wait. What we soon realized is that she just wanted to get us a table quick so she could have better tables for other guests. So she proceeds to walk us to our table... And sits us at literally the worst table in the entire restaurant. It's the kind of table that you wonder why they even bothered to put it there because the location is comically horrible.  To my direct right was the kitchen. I could literally see into the door. And every time a server went in or out all I could hear was the severe loudness of the kitchen.  About 5 feet behind me was the busser station. And if you're unfamiliar with a busser station, it's where the bussers put all the trash and dirty dishes after cleaning their tables.  I can't believe this is where you would seat people in general, let alone people who made a reservation! The pasta dishes are an average of $20 per plate, so there's no way I'm going to pay around $150 for a meal for two people when I can practically reach out and touch the kitchen garbage behind me! We ended up leaving and didn't even order food, and the hostess didn't even say anything to us when she saw us leaving. Talk about a terrible experience and some really bad customer service.  We will not be back.",

First before we ordered, then our food took forever! Like it was over an hour after we came in that we finally ate what we ordered. We did get some bread though, so that helped.   Our server was weird, one girl in our party said she wasn't sure what type of wine to get and he just said ok and walked away, no help. She also was still eating bread with delicious pasta sauce and he tried to take her plate away.   The food was really good, I got the ravioli pasta combo and it tasted great, small portion but I wasn't necessarily expecting Olive Garden. And I sort of feel like if we knew what to order at the start, the food and everything would've been faster but I don't know, four stars because the service just didn't really try and it took so long and I was so hungry!",

I've been to Tomaso's numerous times and I always kick myself for not going more often.  Last time I was there I went with my father. And, like always, as I was looking over the menu I couldn't believe how low some of the prices were for the quality of the food I knew they had. We started with the Fillet Mignon Carpaccio, with I could've eaten ten of. We ordered the Osso Bucco for the main course, which was $22. It was out of this world! It literally falls off the bone it's so tender - to the point I was wondering how they got it on the plate without it falling apart.   Everything was wonderful. The only knock I really had was the price of our after dinner Limoncello's. Our Negroni's during the meal were the typical $10 which is perfectly normal. But when we got the 1.25 oz Limoncello's they were $10 a piece as well. A price I was taken back by but perfectly willing to pay for the quality of the meal we had.   I highly suggest you check out this world class gem! Tomaso has been there every time I've dined there, and even though I'm not a regular, he always stops by to talk and ask how things are. A very nice man. This place will continue to be my suggestion for when people ask me where to get good Italian food. It's also one of the best \"date night\" restaurants I've ever seen - very romantic.",

As soon as our group walked in we were greeted with dirty looks from the manager and older servers. Yes, we were the youngest people in the entire restaurant.

We get seated and wait 20 minutes before deciding to leave after watching tables who arrived after us be greeted by a waiter, presented with a wine list and already had orders taken. Do NOT eat here if you are younger than 50 because the entire service staff will assume you don't have enough money to dine there. We came in there with intentions to spend but apparently our 20 something selves were not welcome. As we left, even the server in our section did not bother to ask what was wrong, he just said have a good night. Well, I hope Tomaso's continues to thrive off the retirement community.",

We ended up parking in a lot around the corner, behind the restaurant, and it was a very short walk to the front entrance.   The interior is cozy, with tasteful decor. Our dinner had some preset options, including a salad, your choice of entree, and dessert. I opted for a prawn dish. The presentation was well done, the prawns were excellently cooked, with a very delicate flavor.   Service was very attentive and drinks were refilled as needed.   Despite the parking hassle, this is a great place for a nice night out and I'll definitely be coming back if I'm in the mood for upscale Italian cuisine.",

    "text": "Having lived in the Valley for 15 years, we finally made it to Tomaso's, a restaurant I have heard about for years. It was not a special night, just a Saturday date night with my husband. We walked in at 7:30 pm with no reservation. That should have been a sign that we shouldn't eat here.  The food was way over priced, especially for what it was. I had the spaghetti cacio y Pepe and my husband had lemon shrimp. His was delicious, but mine tasted very basic. (Yes, it is an easy dish, but I have had carefully crafted ones at other restaurants and been blown away).   The wine poor was generous. We went with the recommendations of the waiter, but was disappointed when he tried to pass off a stale glass of wine. When I asked him how long the bottle had been open, he made a scene to send over the bartender, tell me it was not stale and pour a new glass 'from the same bottle'... It was a completely different wine they poured us the second time. Tired, I didn't want to make a scene, we accepted it and let it sit on the table.  By the end, we just wanted to leave and our waiter was slow to bring the check. Other tables that he was serving were all eyeing one another as well, looking for sympathy.  It was a sad way to spend $100, I wish we would have gone to North or Hillstone, where the food is always good.",

They will accommodate any dish you ask for without the slight hesitation. I enjoy my conversations with Tomaso when I visit.  Superb!",

Service was a tad slow but it was Saturday nite and very busy. The food was the star with two of us having the halibut,scallop, and risotto special. Nero d'Avola wine was good accompaniment. Finished with the chocolate mousse and cannoli. A Phoenix classic!",

He had the filet ravioli and I had the pasta platter with a variety of three different raviolis. Everything was cooked to perfection and service was on point with a smile. I can't wait to come back here again and devour their tasty, creamy, flavorful dishes. Yes.. It's on the pricey side.. But worth every bite. We left with our bellies full and happy. Thank you Tomasos for being an Italian staple to Phoenix!",

Food was good but not \"wow\". Perhaps, it's not fair since I didn't pay for dinner. I would like to try this out on a more casual date...and freely rating this place. One thing was cool that the owner had his own wine labeled. Some free sample...then a bottle later between three of us - it was good! Cheers!",

Whether you consider yourself an aficionado or simply one who loves excellent Italian Food, and you are seeking a very special dining experience, we would like to suggest you treat yourself to an evening at Tomaso's. You will be very glad you did!  Tomaso's on Camelback is beautifully appointed and provides an elegant environment in which to thoroughly enjoy the creations of Chef Tomaso and his Staff. The Restaurant Staff is extremely professional and welcoming, very knowledgeable, and unobtrusively attentive in catering to their guests.    I was a guest of an old friend who had invited me to partner with him in a golf tournament and I wanted to treat him to a special dinner in appreciation. We both happen to share a special affinity for \"Pappardelle al Cinghiale\" (a Wide Noodle Pasta in a Wild Boar Sauce) that is very difficult to find outside of Tuscany. Just on a whim, I went on Tomaso's Web Site to inquire about the possibility of them making us  \"Pappardelle al Cinghiale\" one evening - Quite frankly, I didn't expect to even receive an acknowledgement of my inquiry, much less a response and that would be positive - so, what a delightful surprise it was when just a couple of hours later, I received a very warm response from Ms. Rosie Delgado, the Restaurant Manager, saying \"Chef Tomaso would be delighted to....!\" I was grinning from ear to ear and when I told my friend what was in store for us, he was as every bit as excited as I.  We arrived 15 minutes before our Reservation and when the waiter who greeted our entrance checked the computer, he grinned and said \"Ah \"Pappardelle al Cinghiale\"- my favorite!\" and as he led us to our table and seated us, we both were immensely impressed that, not only were we expected but it was known for what we'd come!   Shortly after we were seated and even before we had selected a bottle of Chianti from the extensive Wine List, Chef Tomaso came to greet us and genuinely made us feel special. In addition to the requested Pappardelle, we deferred to Chef Tomaso's recommendations and we were treated to a fabulous meal that consisted of five separate courses -  an Appetizer of molten Mozzarella in a crust of perfectly seasoned bread crumbs, our specially requested  \"Pappardelle al Cinghiale\" (just like I remembered from Tuscany!), a perfect Lemon Veal Entrata, a delicious Sauvignon Dessert, concluding with a Chocolate Digestivo - each course presented and served elegantly.    Chef Tomaso returned a couple of more times, even sitting with us for a few minutes, checking in on how we were enjoying ourselves and Ms. Delgado did the same. In True European Style, we lingered in very relaxed fashion for over three hours!   Both of us have traveled the world extensively and agreed that nowhere have we experienced a better meal!  In summary.... For Fine Italian Cuisine, an Elegant Environment, Impeccable, Attentive and Accommodating Service, I highly recommend Tomaso's on Camelback.  Buon Appetito!",

    "text": "The only good thing about this restaurant is their delicious herb infused butter.  Where to start...I absolutely detest restaurants that do not keep online menus current.  We sat and the menu was nothing compared to what was online.  The service was okay...our waiter tried...but honestly we had to crumb our own table etc.  the staff never removed plates or utensils from courses etc.  It was like stepping into a Service Bermuda Triangle.  I saw the older couple next to us was treated normally.  Which is odd...my wife and I do not look poor...at all.  So it's not an age vs wealth discrimination as mentioned in other reviews.  I think they depend on \"regulars\" who they cater to.  The crowd was geriatric.  We really wanted to leave but the waiter convinced us to stay.  Despite ordering surf and turf with no breading or cheese due to voiced dietary restrictions we were served battered & fried lobster as a substitute.  The lamb osso buco was inedible...which I ordered due to recommendation.  The caprese salad was served sans balsamic vinegar.  Homemade pasta was also really not good.  My wife had to cut her steak with a butter knife because no one brought a steak knife.  On top of that the restaurant was half empty.  I'm sorry this place just has absolutely nothing going for it.  By the looks of the crowd, menu, food and service, this is where people and cuisine go to die.",

Food was good and service was not good, not near enough staff for the amount of tables, our waiter was very busy the entire time doing his best. This is where I have a value problem, I don't mind the big ticket, but I had better get the whole package and Tomaso's disappointed us.",
