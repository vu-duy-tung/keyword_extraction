The meat had a real meaty quality with a good flavor and very juicy.   Had a black and white malt shake that was much better than the shakes at In& Out.  I wish we had a Shake Shack in the bay area.   Want to complement the manager on duty for being super professional and personable,  going above and beyond in the service department.   She gave us a taster of the shake since I asked about it.   (It's called a \"custard\")   She checked on us while we were eating to ask how we liked our food.   Really impressed with her and Shake Shack!",

The burgers have a unique taste that you cannot get enough of. I strongly suggest getting a double! The cheese fries were very good, and the shake was excellent as well.   The only reason I give it a 4 is because the prices are a bit ridiculous. I spent over $20 for a burger, fries, and a shake, and even though it was very good I could go have a nice sit down dinner somewhere else for that price.",

I love InNOut but it just can't compete with shake shack. InNOuts animal fries are definitely the best, but their shakes suck! Shack fries are good enough. Shack shakes are very good! As for the burgers, they are both great, but the shack burger gets the W.  Tip: order the peanut butter bacon burger from the secret shack menu. It's good.",

I might not be the best person to review this place since I don't eat meat, but the other stuff was worth reviewing I'd say!  The service is good and the atmosphere is nice. It is clean in there too which wins points with me. The first time I went I got the 'shroom burger, which is a fried mushroom stuffed with cheese on a sandwich. It was ok, but not great. I thought I'd like it a lot, but it was just meh, I don't think I'd get it again unless I didn't have a choice haha. I got the French fries which I greatly enjoyed! Crinkle cut fries are yummy, these don't disappoint. The shake on the other hand did disappoint. I love chocolate ice cream, I never get shakes but decided to try one today and the chocolate shake was not enjoyable for me. I'm sure other people would like it, but for me it just seemed too chocolatey which sounds ridiculous haha but it was! But I tried the salted caramel shake and enjoyed it. I'd be down to return and try a different shake. I think this places deserves more like three and a half stars, there's stuff I really liked but the food and shakes weren't quite as good as I had anticipated. I'd come back though!",

I was really excited about their lemonade selection though!  It was a good burger overall. Meat looked really fresh and well cooked. Here were my beefs (haha) with their burger: 1. The bun was good, but it wasn't cut through. So when it is packaged and wrapped, the grease all runs into the bun. I think some people may like that, but a soggy grease bun for me was not tasty. 2. The bacon on my burger really didn't stand out flavor wise. Bacon on my burgers is a huge deal.  The other thing about the cost and food in general for me was that they didn't have any subs for fries. I always want onion rings with my burgers instead of fries and there was none to had here. So that was disappointing.  The Watermelon Mint Lemonade though was amazing. It really was the saving grace for me on the meal. This place is overpriced, not unique enough to compensate for price, and had some things I didn't particularly like about the burger. Probably won't go back again just because of preference to other burger places.",

A real breathe of fresh air. Especially because it's down the hall from a massage parlor, so you may want a change of scenery after a manicure, pedicure, or whatever is your poison. But Jesus Roosevelt Christ I digress.  I went basic as a ham sandwich and just got a burger with some ketchup and lettuce with a side of fries. It was like someone poured love in food form into my mouth! All the answers to life were in that hamburger. It was so good. Even the little things like getting water were cool - they've got these little handles that look like they are from a Speakeasy. I like details.  Hit up Shake Shack before you make a dietary choice not to eat meat for personal or health reasons. You won't regret it unless you eat like 8 in a row, and even then you probs won't, but will just have a tummy ache.",

Furry children are welcome. Even have treats for them.  Just fyi, this IS NOT a fast food restaurant. Good food isnt put in a holding bin for who knows how long and pulled out when time to make a burger. The beef here is Angus beef. No antibiotics and No GMO's (Genitically Made Organisms).  When the burger comes out, it is presented with a smile. Fresh, fresh, fresh Lettuce and tomato all organized for great eye appeal. Bun is awesome. All burgers are prepared to a cooking temperature of \"Medium\". Like that. No more hockey pucks here. The SmokeShack is fantastic. Love the chopped cherry peppers and bacon. Chicken sandwich made with buttermilk looks delicious and is 100 times better than Chick Fil-A from what ive heard. And I like their chicken. I heard the chicken has a special cooking process that most European and very High-end restaurants use. Sous vide, its a vaccum sealed method of cooking to keep juices in,  please look up. Im running out of space here.  Great beers, Froggleap wines, Root beer from the south and custard in cones or Handspun Concretes for dessert. The CamelShack is my favorite. Management great, employees happy equal happy customers. Place is very clean considering the non stop flow of people. Order your food and drinks, get a table, play some foosball and kick back and relax until you get buzzed for your food. Enjoy, I did.  They also donate 5% from the sales of the CamelShack Boston Creme Pie Custard Concrete to the Childrens Hospital.",

For the price, the Bacon Cheddar burger was honestly about the size of a Wendy's Jr Bacon Cheeseburger. Was nice to go there to see what the food is like, but more than likely won't go again",

The fries and the chicken had this strange similar flavor...probably both fried in the same oil which was sort of pungent in a weird way. Not bad, exactly, but not good either. You may like it, but I'd pass. The ice cream is another story. I really liked that, and especially the 'Dust Devil' sundae, so I might go back for ice cream only, but since we had to drive about 1/2 hour to Scottsdale, I think I'd much rather go to the Sugar Bowl. Overall, meh.",

I ordered a Double Smoke Shack which is a double bacon cheeseburger with diced red peppers and delicious sauce. I had to get a shake so I ordered the original chocolate milkshake with whip cream. The shake is made with real ice cream and tastes like a real, thick home made milk shake. I have to say that Shake Shack is officially better than In-n-out burger now - sorry to all the In-n-out fans but seriously Shake Shack is the new leader. I'm looking forward to going back and trying something else on their menu! Highly recommend for a cheat meal day or for a milkshake.",

The workers usually are gossiping, but will talk to you if needed.  Food- I love their chicken sandwich. By far my favorite of everything. They also do specials and they never ever disappoint. Fries are crinkle cut, it brings me back to the good old days. The shakes are expensive and small, but they pack lots of flavor!

I heard a mix about this place how it is so much better than InNOut or its eh. Well the time has finally come and it is here in my very own backyard! So definitely had to try it when I got the chance. We got there and the line looked super intimidating because it was pretty long, but of course we decided to stay anyways. Suprisingly the line went by pretty fast, which was great! I was excited to finally try the famous Shake Shack!   It has an open concept which was pretty cool and the dining room opens to the patio where you can definitely dine in the perfect Arizona spring weather. But too bad we had to take it to go since we are meeting up with some fam in a different part of the mall. I do love the decor though!  Anyways we ordered: ShackBurger (single for me $5.29 and double for him $8.09) Woo $8 burger....dayyuuummm. And we got 1 regular fries and 2 cheesefries...and a couple of small drinks...all for the small price of $32. Wow...it feels and looks like fast food, but the price tho haha. Better be worth it.  Finally eating: The burger was delicious! There was a taste to it that is a little something extra special so def enjoy that burger. The fries were okay tho. The cheese was good but since it was to go, by the time we ate the fries it was a little bit cold as well as the cheese...but it was still not too bad.  Definitely would come back, but is it worth the hype? Not sure yet, I got to go back and try it a few more times ;)  For now...3.5!",

The prices here are double that of In-N-Out, but the burger size is relatively the same. I know I really shouldn't compare the two, but just thinking about that made me regret coming here. Also, they definitely put less vegetables on their burger so just ask for extra onions or tomatoes when ordering. I wish I had done that. But their signature sauce on their burger is a definite winner, it's very sweet, creamy, and cheesy.",

Couple that with the employees being as uncaring as possible, and it's a wonder this place is so popular. The burger was so disgusting neither me or my wife could eat it completely. And our bill? $28. Just wow.   The workers looked like they were forced to be there against their will. Depressed, sad, uncaring. Mumbled their answers back. Was like being at the worst Burger King in the world, except the food wasn't edible like it is there. Look at the pictures we've attached of this stuff. It's THAT disgusting!  Dollar menus are better than this shrill, and I can't believe I'm saying that. It might be gmo free and antibiotic free, but it tasted like they used the squished bun to clean the cooktop with.   For 30 bucks you could get Red Robin, or four meals at In and Out or Smash, all of which taste much better and actually fill you up. And they'll be so gracious as to give you ice in your water. At Shake Shack? Nah, you get warm tap water out of the self serve dispenser . You apparently didn't pay enough for ice.   Abysmal. Go anywhere else. Seriously. Any low end place in the world that's in your mind. It's better than this severely overpriced garbage. You'd be better off with a stick of gum.",

Given the prices, the portions are small compared to what you usually get at a restaurant serving comparable food.  There were two of us ordering and our total bill came to $26.  That's for two hamburgers, one order of fries, and two shakes.  The burgers resembled sliders, they were that small, and the shakes looked like we had accidentally ordered from the kids menu.  As for taste, Red Robin has them beat, and I'm sure I could think of others if I thought for a bit.  We won't be coming back.",

These are quality ingredients!  I almost added pickles to my SmokeShack and am so glad I didn't, the peppers are pickled and spicy.  I don't usually like bacon on my burgers but they use superior (Niman Ranch) bacon, it's crispy and flavorful.  This place has ruined \"fast food\" burgers for me and I couldn't be happier about that.  GO NOW!",

The ambience is great for all ages - from 5 to 100!  We are all here - and the hamburgers never disappoint.  I get two doubles - because they are so yummy.  The first one is to inhale, the 2nd to savor.  The fries are clean, not oily, and made with the freshest potatoes.  Seriously, I come back over and over again for the hamburgers but the custard is an added plus.  To find them in Fashion Square:  across from Harkins Theater in the mall.  Delicious!",

I ordered fries with my burger - they were what you want fries to be, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Yum!  Once I got to the restaurant, the person I spoke with was friendly.  The place itself is nicely laid out and has outdoor seating.  So why only 3 stars? The burger, while very favorable, was cooked rare. I could only eat around the edges. Thank goodness I didn't pay full price for it. Some people may like their burgers rare, but not me.    Will I go back?  - yes.

Husband ordered a second one and said he will order a double next time. Peanut butter milkshake is excellent. The whip cream must be Cabots from Vermont, creamy and delicious. Best milkshake I have had in a long time. The fries were disappointing, crinkle type,very generic, no taste. Will skip these next time. Good seating, TV's in the eating area. Very clean restaurant. Restaurant faces Camelback Road not Scottsdale Rd as others said. Good parking.",

In terms of price no way is it in the right ballpark, the burgers were super small and buying everything separate really sucks because you end up spending way more than with a combo. Service sucked the employees weren't very friendly or caring about a question I asked regarding the food. The manager seemed to be friendly when she was doing refills though. I will say the burger was pretty decent, I was just shocked by how small it was, especially for 6$. The shakes were absolutely abysmal. If I knew that the red velvet shake was just a strawberry shake with red velvet cake chunks in it I probably would've passed, but I guess you have to learn the hard way.  This place is just a combination of Smash Burger and Steak n Shake just double the price for not really adding anything new or exciting into the mix.  Really disappointed I didn't go elsewhere.",

    "text": "For my first review of 2016, I'm going to shake things up.  See what I did there?  Now that I got the bad pun out of the way onto the review.  I guess I'm out the loop cause I've never heard of the Shake Shack.  I just happen to drive past it the day of its opening and then heard about it later on that night. So I went there the next day to see what all the fuss was about.  There was a pretty good size line going outside.  But they were very efficient at handling the line.  I got my order and food in less than 30 minutes.  Cons:  The fries I didn't think were that good.  They were just too hard like they were overcooked and I didn't like the taste of the cheese sauce.  It definitely is a acquired taste.  Pros:  The Black and White shack was fantastic!  I felt that It compliment the burger quite nicely.  As for the burger itself...Amazing!  If I could describe the burger it was as if In & Out burger, Five Guys, and SmashBurger had one big threesome and had a baby.  The burger is the size of a In & Out, The meat has the look of a Smashburger.  And the patty has the moistness of FIve Guys...only better.  But the taste from this piece of beef is all Shack.  I can't recall having a burger that was as juicy as this burger.  Each bite was juicier than the last. I didn't try the custard or the chicken sandwich.  I heard those were really good as well, so I will be back to try those next time.  They also serve beer there as well.  The girl working the counter told me as I was waiting for my food if I ever had Shake Shack?  I told her that I haven't.  She told me that I will not be disappointed.  She was absolutely right. Welcome to AZ Shake Shack.",

Look, everyone had varying tastes on what the best burger in 'Merica is, but when it comes to fast food burger, Shake Shake for me is it.   I've had the Shack burger in NYC multiple times and now in Scottsdale. I've also had plenty of In n Out in California and Steak and Shake in Indiana.  For me, the combo of the bun with the fresh Patty and the shack sauce make Shake Shack, in all locations, the place to beat. It's a wonderful combo of flavor and freshness, every bite savory and indulgant. Some may day is on the expensive side and I will have to admit it's a bit on that, but for me, it's worth it. I eat a burger once every so months, so I budget money (and health) around a shake shack burger.  Burgers are very controversial, that's never going to change. But don't let anyone tell you you shouldn't at least allow your taste buds on glorious sampling of a shake burger. Try it for yourself.   The Shack Is Calling.",

    "text": "Finally! Phoenix (well Scottsdale, technically) has it's very own Shake Shack! I've always equated it to being the In-N-Out of the East Coast, and in a way, it is, but it also really isn't. It has a fairly simplistic menu, at least on the burger side, but they do have some alternatives that In-N-Out does not.  For one, the 'Shroom Burger. It was actually a lot better than I was expecting. I was forewarned that it was a vegetarian burger, but even though I'm more inclined to beef on my burger, it turned out to be pretty darn tasty! Melted cheese, sandwiched between two portobello mushrooms, deep fried in batter sitting below two tomato slices and a lettuce leaf, all within my hamburger buns. Diameter-wise, it was small, like an In-N-Out burger, but also delicious. Be careful of that melted cheese though, cause it definitely oozes and explodes out on the other side of the portobello patty when you least expect it.  The Bacon Cheddar Shack looked small (again) but amazing, with a white cheese sauce threatening to takeover the entire burger. And bacon, of course. However, it seems like it looked way better than it tasted cause the hubby was less than impressed. He was rather disappointed that it wasn't actual cheese and that the bacon and cheese sauce essentially overpowered the entire burger, so much so you couldn't taste the meat (pun intended) of the burger.  Now, the damage was about $7 per burger and $3 per side of fries. So basically, you're paying restaurant prices for fast food. Worth it? Eh...I'm on the fence on that. Maybe if I tried a shake or custard, I might be more partial towards it, but with this experience alone, I think I'll stick with my usual haunts of Five Guys or In-N-Out.",

(Peter Piper would be thrilled!) This is the burger that changed my view on burgers, the master of all burgers. I have tried a variety of the burger choices, which were all very well made and fresh each time. Never disappoints (have visited about 20 times and counting)! I am also a big fan of the crinkle fries, I love a good soft inside and a crispy crinkle! Even better with the cheese and/or bacon added.  Dessert: Smooth custards and concretes, their specialty flavors are a MUST.   Drinks: The root beer on tap is my favorite (which mind you, I'm not much of a soda drinker)! So much flavor, just better than any old root beer. I recently tried their wine by the glass for the first time (red), and it's very smooth! Would order again! Next time I'll review the white wine.  As always, can't wait to come back. If you haven't been here, you're missing out!! HURRY!!",

Portion wise, the burgers are small. Crinkle Fries were good and crispy. The 'shroom patty was different. Glad I tried it, next time when I go to a restaurant that charges $14, I won't complain.  The Shacago dog was really messy. They just shoved a lot of condiments onto the dog. Wasn't enjoyable. What a shame. Better stick with Portillo's or Sonic's Chicago Dog.

    "text": "It's difficult to gauge a burger place on the west coast of the USA once you've had competitor burgers like In N Out or Gordon Ramsay \"Burgr\". Shake Shack's origins are in New York City, but its principles have carried over dutifully to the west coast, and through those principles, the food really shines on its own.  I came here a few days ago to pick up a to-go order, consisting of: Shroom Burger SmokeShack Shack-Cago Dog Fries  While there, I noticed they had beers on tap and dog treats. Since I don't have a dog and I was driving, I can't comment on either, but I will say that I saw other customers with dogs eating dog treats and other customers drinking the good stuff!  Anyway, when I got home, the food was still hot (I have one of those hot / cold bags that you see food delivery drivers often use). I dug in, and here were the results:  - Fries are crispy on the outside, soft in the middle. Similar to ordering fries \"well done\" from In N Out. - Shack-Cago Dog is really unique, it's got a clusterfuck of vegetables including peppers and cucumber and tomato to pair with the hotdog itself. - The SmokeShack is a unique pairing of chopped up spicy peppers and bacon. Quite a flavorful punch! - The Shroom Burger is vegetarian, and the \"burger patty\" is packed full of flavor. What I liked about this in particular is that it doesn't try to pretend it's a meat patty, it really just tastes like a damn good garden burger! Props to Shake Shack for authenticity points!  Here's where things get a little interesting, I looked at my bill and saw it was $23+. I didn't even order any drinks. So I can understand how other Yelpers have pointed out how the prices here seem a bit steep for burgers, especially considering the burgers themselves are about the same size as an In N Out burger, but stylistically carries themes from SmashBurger in terms of flavor and food presentation.  I could sort of see this from a different POV: Maybe you're paying for the experience? The customer goes to the counter to order their food. The kitchen behind the counter is open face, small, and is on a roll with production non-stop during the busiest of hours (when is Shake Shack not busy?) There's booze and ice cream on tap, and treats for the dogs. The ambiance is modern with dim lighting and trendy background music.  Does this really justify the high price point that other Yelpers are pointing out?  What ultimately saves this place in my opinion is the uniqueness of said experience. I don't know too many burger places out there that are this \"fast-casual\" AND serve alcohol. You might be able to name a few, but not on the national brand that Shake Shack is quickly becoming.  And to think that once upon a time, Shake Shack was just a shack that sold burgers.  So, I'm left to give you this takeaway, readers: Shake Shack is certainly a unique experience, it's fun, the burgers are good albeit pricey, so I give them four stars there alone, not to mention the options for dogs allowing man's best friend to feel included in your dining experience. There's booze and ice cream available on tap. You should still go to at least say you've been to a Shake Shack, and you can make your own takeaway judgment, but for me, Shake Shack is a seldom experience, not a frequent habit (I've been three times in a year if that gives you a point of reference). But to say \"I'm just going to In N Out\" would be equally unfair, since neither joint is trying to be like another.",

    "text": "I'm normally a burger and fries girl.  I'm such a cheap date.  It was a beautiful Friday afternoon when we stopped by Shake Shack for lunch.  The line was long but it moved pretty fast.  I think we waited 10-15 minutes before we were up front and ordering a great meal.  We shared a SmokeShack, ShackBurger, shared some cheese fries, washed it all down with an Abita draft root beer, had a couple of bites of the Shack Cago Dog, and a spoonful or two of the CamelShack.  I really enjoyed my SmokeShack which had bacon, cherry peppers, and Shack sauce in it. It had a good char and it was juicy and flavorful. The peppers had a nice bite and I dumped any remnant peppers onto my cheese fries which were amazing. Crinkle cut fries with all their curves and all their edges, all their perfect imperfections, smothered in cheese sauce...Aw yis! *kisses fingertips*  In my opinion, the burgers are the perfect size.  It's certainly not a fork and knife kind of burger where you have to slice it in half just to eat it but it filled me up all day.  Being happy and full is what you pay for, right?  The ingredients were also of good quality so it justifies our $30 bill.  Yeowch!  In the mood for a sweet treat?  You can't forget dessert!  Get the CamelShack [vanilla custard with salted caramel and a slice of The Bakery Phx banana cream pie].  5% of sales for the CamelShack gets donated to the Phoenix Children's Hospital.  All in all, in my opinion, Shake Shack was worth the hype! I just wish it wasn't over the river and through the woods. Third AZ location in the east valley please!",

    "text": "Ive heard so much about this east coast hype, I had to check it out  I ordered the regular (single and double) shake burger, fries, and a frozen custard. We waited about 10 minutes for our buzzer to go off to pick up our food.   The burger was good. The buns were so light and fluffy (I'm sure that a lot of people love this, but I'm a toasty/crunchy type person, I wasn't the biggest fan). The ingredients were fresh and the cheese was perfectly melted. But a single burger DID NOT fill me up at all. Their crinkle fries were perfect. Hot, toasty, and just the right amount of salt. It wasn't until I finished my fries was I moderately content with my meal. I can't remember the frozen custard name that I ordered but it was the one was peanut butter. OMG IT WAS TO DIE FOR. Thick, creamy, sweet, didn't melt while I was eating my meal. I highly recommend this!  If I was to compare this east coast goodie to our west coast rival, I'd still choose WEST COAST. Why?  - Cost: I paid $27 for 2 burgers, 2 fries, and 1 frozen custard. Thats too much for just burgers and fries for lunch. The price would have been higher if I ordered a drink/shake too!  - Burger: Was a little disappointing. A single didn't even come close to filling me up, a double didn't even come close to filling a man up either (weren't not even crazy hungry eaters). The taste was good, but nothing crazy special which would make me crave it in the future.  I don't think I will go out of my way to come here, but if I am in the area, I won't hesitate to come here again.   Recommendations:  - Fries  - Frozen goodies  Environment: 4/5 (lots of people may not find a table) Food: 3.5/5 Price: 2/5 Service: 4/5",

At this time of the year, sitting on their outside patio is prime time people watching and is very desirable.  I highly recommend giving them a try.  Definitely a good burger.  But the fries are the stunner here!  Oh their fries are but pure perfection!   Crispy salty outside with a delicious moist center that makes for an amazingly delicious pomme frite!  If you are into a traditional kind of burger (ie lettuce tomato onion pickle) then heed my warning.  When you're done paying $10.61 for a burger and fries, only --- no shake, no drink, I say go back to Five Guys and pay ~$6 for a burger that is just as amazing or better in the same mall with less of the \"Wow-factor-of-an-overrated-chain\" line.  Return Factor: 30%",

    "text": "I don't think you can really call anything at Scottsdale Fashion Square a \"shack.\" ;) Especially this modern looking behemoth of a building! I had heard of Shake Shack in various parts of the country, so when I heard they were opening up a location here I knew I had to check it out to see what the hype was about!  The menu consists of various burgers, fries, hot dogs, and various shakes. Each menu item has the caloric count on it so you know exactly how much you are cheating on your diet :). I tried some of the chick 'n shack, had a 'shroom burger, and had a black and white shake.   The chicken sandwich was delicious, with crispy and tender meat, soft potato bun, with toppings that went well with each other. The 'shroom burger had a batter that was light and crispy, with a well seasoned portobello mushroom. While overall it was a good tasting vegetarian burger, I didn't really like the gooey cheese that went with it.   The burgers themselves are a bit small but the quality of the ingredients make up for it.  The shake was a perfect thickness, easy to sip through a straw, with rich chocolate and vanilla flavor.  My order took only a few minutes to be made and I was out the door in no time!  Overall it's a tasty option for a meal if you're at the mall.",

    "text": "I've had my first Shake Shack in NYC four years ago and was in love with this spot.  When I was I Arizona last month for a week for work, I was delighted to see a Shake Shack location in Scottsdale, so we gave it a shot and ordered the same burger and fries we loved from our first meal at the NYC Upper West Side location.  The restaurant itself is nice, plenty of space for you to sit indoors or outdoors and there's a Disneyland line type of queue for you to stand in (as you wait to place your order at the counter) if they get busy during peak meal times.  When we arrived, there were only two customers ahead of us, so we were able to order right away.  Between my hubby and I, we ordered the Smoke Shack and cheese fries, but asked for the cheese on the side. When our order came out, our fries were covered in cheese, great.  When we looked at the burger, we didn't realize we ordered a chopped cherry pepper burger, there was an abundance of it in our burger.  After scraping off most of the cherry peppers in our burger, we enjoyed our burger, but wasn't in love with it.  The fries would have been great if I had the option to dip my fries in the cheese sauce I wanted on the side (I didn't want to deal with returning it to get the sauce on the side).  Overall, our Shake Shack experience was just okay.  They're opening their first San Diego location sometime next year (where I live), but I'm not as excited about that news after getting my fix at the Arizona location.  Oh well, on to the next burger.",

Anyways, someone provided a helpful tip on this page to park in the garage and take the elevator up (we took the escalator) and it was right at the end of the wing. The line was out the door around noon today and I placed my order at 12:23, took 10 minutes until my food was ready. I ordered chicken shack burgers, a single shack burger, and a shroom burger. I also ordered fries with cheese on the side and the Dust Devil concrete with added chocolate chunks. The latter two are the winners in my book! That cheese sauce is something else, and the mix of flavors in the frozen custard worked well together.   Really great customer service, one of the employees gave us samples of the custard while we waited in line. My big order was executed correctly and the to-go bags were easy to carry away. Lots of seating and in a good location at the end of the mall, next to the outside parking lot and Thirsty Lion. I want to try some of their shakes so maybe next time.  Definitely on the pricier side for fast food, but my mom remarked on how good the chicken was and the experience makes it all worth it. They have calories listed next to each item but don't pay attention to those.",

We ordered the smoke stack burger which is a Single or Double Cheeseburger topped with applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper and ShackSauce. I had the single and thought the burger was no bigger than a McDonald's regular hamburger.  Also had the Shack-cago Hot Dog which was very good. The mixture of peppers and pickle made the dog tasty.  Also had a chocolate shake, regular fries and a mango lemonade.  The chocolate shake was a little melted and could have been a little bit more solid frozen.  The French Fries were crispy the way I like them and not soggy.   The Mango Lemonade sounded interesting enough to order and was good but definitely had a tang to it at the end.  Overall we had 2 burgers, fries, a chocolate shake and a mango lemonade which cost $31. Those might be New York prices but thought it was on the high end which you could get a gourmet burger for similar cost.  Rating it a 3 for high cost compared to what you get.",

I tried my girlfriend french fries and I guess maybe I'm not a fan of criss cut fries, because they didn't taste any better than the ones you can put in the oven at home. I should have tried a milkshake here since they're well known for them, but I wasn't that hugnry this time around and just wanted to try the burger.

Service was perfect, food spot on, and everything screamed of Shake Shack's high quality.   It's expensive if you are accustomed to paying less than $20 for fast food. This isn't typical fast food though, it's made from the best quality ingredients. I've seen reviews that complain about the price....yes, it's higher than McDonald's but they aren't even apples and apples. Can't say enough about how great it is to have a Shack in Arizona!!!",

The spiciness of the SmokeShack really appealed to me. The regular crinkle fries were good. To finish, we shared the CamelShack frozen custard concrete, which is basically like a soft serve ice cream, the flavor was good, a bit tad too sweet. Overall, ShakeShack fills a niche in the fast food industry. It's a little higher end than In & Out and Carl's Jr but not as good (or as expensive) as the closer to \"gourmet\" burgers joints (e.g. Hopdoddy).",

    "text": "Decided to put this to the test against the king \"In-N-Out\". Let me start by saying the staff was friendly and helpful, the kitchen area looked organized and clean, and the rest of the restaurant was trendy modern and pleasing to the eye. I felt like the music was to loud, but to each their own. I ordered a single patty shack burger with cheese, lettuce, tomato, shack sauce, pickle, and onion. I also ordered a side of fries, and a strawberry shake. This came out to $15.13!!!! This is quite literally double the price I would pay for the same thing at \"In-N-Out\". The first thing I tried were the crinkle cut french fries, and they were burnt. After tasting them, I took a closer look at them, and you could visually tell they were over done french fries. Considering the price I paid, they should have somebody in the kitchen paying attention to these details. I have been going to \"In-N-Out\" for 20+ years, and I can count the number of times on one hand that this has happened there. The burger was actually very good. It tasted fresh, light, and almost healthy. The shake was also very good. Was it worth 15$? Absolutely not! Honestly, I do not understand how they get away with charging these prices? I do not see this business model penetrating the market as far as its main competitor \"In-N-Out\", especially when \"In-N-Out\" has better quality control, consistent friendly services, and quality ingredients. \"In-N-Out\" wins 10 out of 10 times. If I wanted a different burger that has a somewhat lighter healthier taste I will go to \"The Habit Burger\".",

The Burgers have layers of flavor, fries are crispy, fluffy and perfectly seasoned (cheese sauce on the side is a must), shake quakes are \"outta this world\" yummy!   My friend and I each had the classic cheeseburger and it was so good. The burgers are smaller in size compared to most restaurant burgers  (bigger than sliders though) which was perfect for me but I know my husband would want two.  We also shared the chicken sandwich and it was crispy and juicy, similar to chik fila but turned up a few notches on flavor and quality. The vanilla custard was simple, utterly creamy and perfect.  Last note, the team at shake shake represents the brand well. They were friendly and were world class in serving us and other diners.",

We made a special trip to this mall, just so I could try SS.   I have to say the burger was 4 stars. I asked for it cooked medium, but it came out just under well done. If you cook BURGERS for your business, this is a BIG DEAL and something that Inn and Out with the smaller burgers has ALWAYS done right!   I tried the Custard, sounds amazing, did not deliver in the flavor department. I was expecting something to WOW me, and it was okay, probably would never order again.   I tried the Fries at $2.99, I thought they were pricey, but hey I need to get the whole experience, and okay, not sure if they are fresh on site or frozen, but at that price point if I had a SS in Reno, I would only order the fries sometimes.   My burger was definitely the best part at just under $6, I was a Fan, and would dine there again, and try the different versions, like bacon, mushroom, etc.",

If you are one that likes to know what place it compares to most, I would say the patties are like the ones at culvers and are kinda crispy.  I got a mint chocolate shake flavor of the week. For $5.59 it was pretty small and did not taste that good. Earlier in the week I had a mint oreo shake from qt and it was way better for $1.99.   All in all, its sad to say this place is a little over hyped for the price and quality of food. Two people with one shared shake cost $24.79. Get two drinks and you are over $30 for fast food.  The inside of the restaurant kinda had a funky smell too. I will stick to culvers, five guys, portillos, chick fil a, and in n out for my fave joints.",

Burgers run between $5.50 - $9.50 and are pretty small, fries are 4 bucks, again small, and a 5 dollar hot dog looks great. We hit the magic $20.00 per person check average with some drinks, burgers, fries and a shared CamleShack. Heck lot's of people are paying it so if they can get it?!?!.

The burgers are tiny & are extremely overpriced, $8.55 for a single burger with no sides. The buns look like they were purchased from the dollar store.  It isn't that the food is bad, just really overpriced & underwhelming. If your looking for a burger place there are plenty of better cheaper options out there; Five Guys, In N Out, Habit, Culver's, etc...",

    "text": "Ok so I am an in-n-out girl through and through so I went to Shake Shack tonight with a really open mind. I was excited when I saw it first opened and couldn't wait to try this east coast staple. We ordered the Smoke Shack burger, Shack-cago dog, cheese fries and a drink. This all came out to about $20.   Pros: the fries. Omg the fries. I would come back for the cheese fries alone. The burger and hot dog were also both pretty good as well. But the fries were the standout for me.   Cons: we came on a Friday night around 6:30pm and they only had 2 out of the 3 registers open so we had to wait in line for quite some time before ordering.  Next would have to be the size and pricing of the food. I was shocked when we picked up our dinner at how small the portions were.  Like I said, the food was good but if I'm going to pay $20 for cheeseburgers and hot dogs dinner I would at least like to get my money's worth. We were hungry again by the time we got home. :(  All in all I would like to come back just to have the fries again and to try a shake, but if I'm going for a burger I'd rather go to in-n-out for the same amount of food for half the price",

    "text": "Arrived on opening day!  Got in the monstrous line at 8:26.  Ordered at 9:01.  Food was served at 9:13.  The cashier was thoroughly trained on the register.  Not all the registers were open but I'm not sure if the kitchen could keep if they went any faster.    There are two sets of smallish flat screens mounted on the upper wall of the dining room.  The patio was very large (they took Modern Steak's entire patio space looking out into the parking lot) and had a lot of larger capacity communal type seating (lots of benches, long tables, ring of seats around the fire pit).  The brand new wood-decorated interior was a perfect temperature when they had the front open to the patio.  The salted crinkle cut fries ($2.99) had a great texture, and are best when they are fresh and hot.  They become less crunchy and fluffy as they cool.  The chicken sandwich ($6.29) has a noticeable yet mild kick and a really great crunch.  The bun was toasted well.  The chicken was somewhat oily, but very juicy, and you can tell it is non-processed white meat.  Compared to Chick-fil-A, this chicken's crust was much crunchier, and the bun also had a better texture thanks to the toasting (CFA's sandwiches tend to be very \"soft\" though their seasoning is always spot-on.)  The black and white shake ($5.29) was incredible and actually tasted like the cookie's frosting.  I couldn't really place the chocolate flavor, but it was unique.  It was not too thick, but not watery either...just perfect.  Nitpicks: The ketchup dispensers were empty, but they had large plastic Heinz bottles out for customers to use.   It's quite loud inside due to the louder volume music and all the hard surfaces, and because it was very busy due to the opening day rush.  Their water comes from a self-serve dispenser on the condiment table, so there doesn't seem to be a way to get ice water.  They front the valet lot, but for parking I just used a parking garage and walked through the mall.  Overall: The employees are what push this to a 5.  I was surprised at how helpful and hospitable the employees cleaning up the dining room were, even offering to take my trash and throw it away for me.  Many employees made friendly small talk with customers, and a gentleman who I believe was the manager was on the floor.  This is also a great location for younger people, as it's more relaxed and quite a bit cheaper than Zinburger, while offering a more upscale (nicer decor, serving alcohol) atmosphere than Five Guys, The Habit, and Smashburger.",

    "text": "My husband and I wander all over the valley to try restaurants. Prior to a movie, we stopped in at the Shake Shack and we were not impressed.  I stuck to the basics - the single cheeseburger. I was never asked or given options as to what I wanted on it (5 Guys) - and when I ordered grilled onions (In-N-Out), was told they don't offer them \"because of other people that may have onion allergies.\" The counter person also never asked me if I still wanted regular onions.....I had to ask.  Let's review the \"no grilled onions\" excuse: ~How many MORE people want to order grilled onions than the rare person having an allergy?? ~Do you have more than one grill? ~Can you grill onions at the beginning of the day and clean the grill? ~Do you own a skillet you can use separately for onions???  My husband had a bacon burger. Exactly what grill did they cook that on and do they have a \"halel \" grill?? Someone seems to be lacking in basic critical thinking skills.  The single cheeseburger I ordered was hardly larger than a slider - with very pink/medium rare meat. It was just average. Fries were good - very crispy, although not that hot when served.  Lemonade was great.  Bottom line:  The food did not equal that of either 5 Guys OR In-N-Out and certainly didn't justify a $26 bill for 2 burgers/sm fries/drinks (no ice cream drinks).",

The burger is thin, but moist inside. It's \"well-seasoned\" (some might say \"salty\"). The bun is fresh and fluffy. The sauce is tangier than the usual 1000 island sauce on most burger. Tomatoes are small, but very red and firm. Lettuce is crisp. It's a nice package. Note that I left off the onions and pickles.  Crinkle cut fries are good, but a bit dry. The cheese sauce definitely adds flavor!  Vanilla shake was very good, as well.  Need ice, though, to go along with the water dispenser.

Truthfully, I'm apparently the only one... but here is my review.  I'm vegetarian and really love a good veggie burger. House-made ones are my jam. When I see portobella mushroom burger instead, I automatically assume-- no, KNOW-- they are writing it in. It's not unique or fun or at all delicious. Does any vegetarian truly say, HOORAY, a GIANT mushroom on a bun! My lucky day!  NO. We don't. I can tell you things vegetarians like: effort, good veggie burgers made with nuts, legumes, grains and spices.   We also like fries. These crinkle-cut fries are obviously from a bag and truthfully, In n' Out, Burger King and INSERT YOUR FAVE CHEAPO GREASE JOINT HERE have better. Not playing.  I ordered a grilled cheese. At In n' Out, they give this to you with all the toppings. Not here. It's child-sized, almost $4 a la carte (!) and made with peelie cheese.   The burger-eating people and my hot-dog eating kids were fine with the place, but admitted it was no better than In n' Out. And in fact, it was not AS good either. Not coming back. Resisting the cute ambiance and fun atmosphere and cool firepit (which earned it some stars).   Goodbye $40. I legit came home and ate a salad because grilled cheese and fries wasn't enough for my belly.",

Their most basic burger is the Single ShackBurger, which is about $5 and surprisingly filling and delicious. They have some basic crinkle fries that you can either get plain or throw some melted cheese on. It takes about 10 minutes or so for them to get your food ready, and they give you a little buzzer so you can know when you can pick up your food.  I'd recommend this place if you're confined to this the area and in the mood for a tasty burger. You can probably get a larger burger for a lower price elsewhere, but these burgers will not disappoint.",

My favorite items are the concretes which are out of this world and understandably how this restaurant gained a cult following. Made from frozen custard, it is no wonder the shakes and concretes stand out from the main stream.  Shack Attack: Super chocolately goodness, almost chocolate overload.

They seriously taste like frozen Ore Ida French fries you would buy at the supermarket. Again for the price of the fries I expected a much bigger serving.   Lastly, they dont trust you to get your own drink refills so you're forced to bother one of the workers everytime you need a refill. Just put a drink station in your dining room! It will save your employees time from refilling drinks all the time.  I got a double burger, fries and a drink for 14 dollars. It's just as expensive as five guys but nowhere near as good. If your looking for lots of different toppings...you will be disappointed. I was still hungry after paying 14 dollars because the portions were so small. :(",

Lets start with that soft potato non-gmo pillowy bun....just great quality ingredients in every layer.  Yup that's right I don't never ever overlook a set of great buns hun.  Personally I would pay $15 for this burger....Yes!  It's a burger.....this ain't no stinkin' buffet....so whenever available hell yea I'm choosing quality over quantity.  Even the fries......YES the ever so popular crinkle cut fries...even the artificial ingredients and preservatives are removed.  So they ain't your run of the mill crinkle cut fries.  So when add this burger + fries combo at SS.  You got a 4 star winning combo!  So bottomline here's the deal.  If you got a big appetite or perhaps your on a \"budget\" than well.....what I'm trying to say is the Shack just ain't going to cut the mustard.  If you appreciate a premium product and your OK eating a relatively pedestrian burger that isn't the size of your dome piece.  Oh did I not already mention they have fantastic soft buns of steel?!",

I do like how the buns are cut only partially so your burger and condiments don't fall out. Other than that, Sorry. Just didn't cut it for me.  The fries were great though :)   The milkshakes in my humble opinion are not worthy of the price tag. They are good but not blow your mind good. Maybe I'm too partial to my other burger joint favorites..facilities were clean and service was great. Which is a definite plus!",

Both Smash Burger and Five Guys are both way better values and have a taste advantage. In-N-Out is cheaper and better as well. And for less money you can get a fresh quarter pounder at McDonalds instead of a tiny beef patty at Shake Shack.  Fries are good and the concrete I ordered was good. But for nearly $14 for those and almost slider-sized burger it was about $6 overpriced.",

As I had skipped breakfast, I was definitely hungry and could not wait for that first bite. It was good, but it did not stand out to me (or my husband) as anything special. If we had to rank the burger, it would come in behind In N Out and Smashburger. My favorite thing was the shake - delish!  Also, our bill was over $40, which I thought was a lot to spend on lunch at a fast food burger joint. Otherwise, the staff was super friendly and efficient, the dining area was clean, and I enjoyed the decor/ambiance. I may stop in again if I'm back in the area, but wouldn't make the drive from Gilbert just to experience Shake Shack.",

Last time I ate at a shake shack was at city field in queens, when the mets were still the mets (meaning they were in their rightful place getting smashed by a sub .500 Cincinnati Reds team). The menu looks to have expanded and improved.   I don't remember hot dogs being on the menu, so I indulged in a chicken dog that was very juicy and completed the set of cheese fries very well. Bonus points for throwing calories on the board (this is something az eateries are very hot or miss on).   Revolutionary? No, but this is one east coast influence I won't mind eating at again and again.",

The \"Crinkle\" shaped fries are delicious and I end up eating too many of them!  My mom is a big fan of hot dogs and this is her favorite place to get one.

I got the Chick'n Shack with fries and it was everything I had hoped and wished it to be: amaze. The only reason that I am giving it four stars has nothing to do with the food. It was because 1.) my drink had a single cube of ice in it and there was no open soda fountain to fill it to the top with ice and 2.) my friend and I sat outside and the sun was glaring into my eyes and there was no way for me to shelter myself. Aside from those two minor inconveniences, everything was great!",

My personal favorite is In & Out, followed by either 5 Guys or Smash Burger. This is a softer bun like 5 Guys (best fries ever). We ate at Shake Shack in NY so we were glad to see it come to the valley.  Although you are way to many hamburger joints around, this is a good one... It all depends on what you are looking for but don't pass Shake Shack up. Cheers. JJ",

And some items were really expensive. I haven't tried their shakes so we might go back for them.",

There's something about the combination of crispy chicken, pickles, & mayo that is great!  And these cheese-fries...a mouthwatering guilty pleasure!  I splurged and also ordered the Shack Attack. I have to say the Shack Attack concrete ice cream dish is a bit overrated and I expected more since it's description on the menu makes you want it instantly.  The food is made-to-order and fresh.  I liked that at this location, it was very open to outside but enough that you were still inside the restaurant; perfect for when it's too hot to eat outside but you still want some fresh air.  If you are looking for a typical greasy American meal, this is the place!  Too bad there isn't one near me in Wisconsin! :(",

The only redeeming quality were the fries, which were so tasty and the half decent black and white shake. Taking all said into consideration, it would be highly unlikely if I were to ever return.",

    "text": "The mushroom burger is delicious and crispy on the outside while soft on the inside. The bun is soft and more of a brioche type. A downside is that the burgers are pretty small and not very filling (and that's what I say as a short European girl who doesn't eat massive portions!) The fries are average.  The concretes (something between a soft serve and a milkshake) are good but nothing special. Mainly pretty sweet and plain in taste. All in all it is alright food but comparably pricey for the size of the serve. In that price range I'd rather choose Five Guys because of more reasonable portion sizes. In the range of the burger I'd rather choose In n Out because of similar quality and portions size to remarkably lower prices. But it is still  worth a try!  Fun Fact: The Camel Shake was created for the Phoenix region and is only served here. 5% of the money from the Camel goes to children's charity in the valley.",

When I asked about doing a bun less burger for my daughter who can't have gluten, the young lady taking my order was really helpful and conscientious about getting her order dialed in.  Despite a hectic atmosphere and total inundation of high school  and junior high students, our order came pretty fast and it was all delicious. The place didn't feel chaotic; just lively.  Our burgers were awesome; just the right size.  We loved the crinkly fries and the shakes were great.     I wanted to say all that before I tell the next part:  When the cashier rang up my order, I realized I didn't have my wallet.  In a panic I brought out my phone and asked about using Apple Pay.  The regional manager walked over and told me they weren't set up for that and then smiled and told me, lunch was on him.  I tried to hand off the little bit of cash I had and offered to go home and get my wallet. It was such a huge kindness, and I am now officially a loyal customer ,who promises to double check she has her wallet.",

We've already gone twice in three weeks.  Obviously, the burgers are a must. The burger itself is a high-quality meat, nice and juicy and I love their shack sauce. But perhaps the best thing is the bun - it's like a little pocket so the burger doesn't slide out the back. Genius.    I also love the cheese fries. One order is big enough for my man and I to split.  On our last visit we tried the Chicken Shack. I will say the chicken was really juicy which is always a challenge on a chicken sandwich but it lacked a little something. Next time I think I would add a slice of cheese to it. It was good but the burger is way better.  And of course there are the shakes! Really yummy and thick. We like the black and white.  Next time we're going for the hot dog. I can only assume we'll have tried everything on the menu by the end of the year - haha!  Both times we went it was dinnertime and the line was long. This may be because it's still new. But considering the locations in NY always had lines too, only time will tell.",

It's my husbands first time, and mine.... I've lost count.  We go wild here, shackburgers, chili dog, chicken sandwiches, cheese fries, apple pie shake and a blonde beer.  HEAVEN on earth.  They hand us the buzzer machine.  The wait gives me mixed feelings of impatience and hungry anticipation. Hunger is a real thing for me.  Finally, a few minutes later, we get to dig in! It looks beautiful. It smells delicious. The apple pie shake tastes like thanksgiving day desert in a cold glass.  We eat every bite with no regrets. There are no photos, no evidence, no calories.  Just bliss.",

The entrance is nearby the uncovered parking at the very end of the mall (that, if you keep the main entrance to the mall on your left, drive forward and the uncovered parking will be on your right hand, and then at the very end of the parking, the restaurant is over there.)  I had the shroom burger with no tomatoes, and cheese fries. The cheese fries was very good, fresh, and hot. The shroom burger was good too. A good choice for people who only eat halal beef. The only thing I didn't like, and that's why I gave this review a 4-stars, is that the cheese wasn't spicy. It was hot but not spicy. I asked to have a spicy food, but that choice is not available. They only offer spicy spice on a side. Other than that, i really liked the food.",

I love frozen custard and was craving something chocolate-y after spending the day walking around, and the \"shake attack\" definitely fit the bill - chocolate custard with chocolate cookie/brownie bits and chocolate sprinkles.. I don't think I've eaten that much chocolate in a few years!!  I'm not the biggest chocolate lover by any means, but this was perfect.. and perfect for the hotter weather we've been starting to experience!  In a previous visit I've also tried their burgers and \"black and white\" shake, which were also delicious :)  I might've liked everything simply because it is a bit of a novelty, since shake shack isn't located in many places out west, but I'll buy into the gimmick :) Try their custard for sure tho, or their shakes.. definitely worth the calories and time in line!",

A friend that lives in Phoenix recommended I try out this place, and I'm glad that I did! I liked it as much as I did for In-N-Out Burger. (I know this will offend some people, but whatever...)  I'm not gonna lie, I thought it was super pricey having to pay $19 for a cheeseburger, cheese fries and a small salted caramel shake. But it all tasted great, so that kind of made up for it. The place didn't seem like your average burger joint, which was a good thing. Quality was what they promised, and I got it, so I guess I shouldn't complain.   Can't wait till the company makes their way to St. Louis....",

    "text": "My family has been coming to this Shake Shack since it first opened... we've had a few less than desirable experiences but overall okay. Yesterday, after a long day with my daughter and 3 month old son I decided to treat us to Shake Shack through Postmates. I was excited, the delivery was free and it was only going to take 35 minutes. I am notified on my phone that my order is at the door, only to discover I have been given the completely wrong order and on the bag it's for an Anna R. through Doordash. I try messaging the number I was given from Postmates but that's not how that works so I try to call Shake Shack hoping to reach the manager to clear it up. I call six times in fifteen minutes, the voicemail states they're on the floor and I can leave a voicemail and I will hear back within 24 hours. Obviously that does me no good in this situation so the only thing I can do is load up the kids in the nasty heat and drive down to the store, which defeats the entire purpose of using Postmates. When I get there I ask to speak to the manager so she calls out for who I believe is named Logan, but I can't remember because I wasn't introduced to him. I explain the situation, and mention that the only way to fix the situation was to get in my car and come down there (he chuckled and said \"right\" with a smile on his face) and he very quickly just asks what my order was so they can make it. I'm given my food to go and a \"sorry that happened.\" That's it. My food wasn't comped, I wasn't offered any sort of discount, not even a milkshake. In my opinion, this is very poor customer service. They screwed up with Postmates, I'm beyond inconvenienced and nothing is done about it. I'm not one to make a scene and at that point I was over it, so I didn't push the issue any further - but this has left a bad taste in my mouth and I won't be returning any time soon.",

Needless to say, I'm pretty impressed with the Shake Shack franchise and how they've done.  Food wise, I just ordered their regular burger with fries on the side for my first round ever.  I'm thinking what makes these burgers are the butter buns; soft with every bite and melts away on your palates!  The burger itself is cooked to perfection and just the way I ordered it.  I was very impressed since it's like a fast food chain popping out burgers through a line, but with enough care and attention to make it a burger to remember!  The fries were crinkle and cooked to a good crispy bite.  I'm not a fan of crinkle fries; weird since it's just the shape.  I've heard about of their shakes, but man my belly and love handles said NO!  Maybe next time when I want to splurge a bit!  -  Enjoy!",

I got a cheeseburger, the crinkle cut fries and a soda. I went back later after the newness settled (ha!) a bit with my family and brought my puppy (dog friendly patio!).  First time food: delicious but not my favorite burger...maybe I'm just too west coast but I definitely prefer in'n'out FOR THR BURGER. The crinkle cut fries were to die for. Pretty expensive though for a lunch burger that you stand in line to order and pick up.  Second time: 3 cheeseburgers, crinkle cut fries, cheese fries, a shared black and white shake, a house draft ale, and on soda...$40+ but they brought us a sample poochini for Duke...his first soft serve experience and he was in love.  Service is incredible, everyone is so sweet and they are efficient with the daunting lines. The food is good...but expensive. And I definitely never need the cheese fries again. And to be honest, for a business with the word shake in the name...I wasn't overly impressed with the shake.   Verdict: I'll go back from time to time because it's close to work and was good overall and I'm obsessed with crinkle cut fries. But I don't think it's going to be a must stop in my lunch rotation.",

Their menu is extensive in options and they give you a restaurant pager to let you know when your order is ready.  I ate their Shackburger, regular fries, and had a vanilla milkshake as well.  The burger was very, very tasty, albeit small as others have noted.  The quality and texture of the burger makes up for the size however.  The bun and burger meat was just perfect and it is a softer hamburger to eat in comparison to other restaurants (which is not a complaint).  The crinkle cut fries were also delicious, though not my favorite fries.  (I prefer mine not as crispy and with a softer potato interior, more in like with in'n'out style fries, but I think I'm in the minority here.)  And the milk shake was also fantastic.  Vanilla flavor was very well done and the serving size was great as well.  If Shake Shack was next to an In'n'out, I would maybe go to Shake Shack maybe once for every six visits to In'n'out simply because of cost in comparison to portions.  Still absolutely five stars, and I would definitely recommend going here as the only con would be the serving size.  You will not be disappointed with the flavor and quality.",

Everyone was making sure that we were satisfied with our food and that everything was right. Felt like I was at an Apple store. They got the details right from the food to the actual location. Simple, elegant, and delicious both to be taken by mouth and visually.   Love this place!!! We will be making the drive from Mesa more often now. This was the only real pregnancy craving my wife had, she is more than satisfied! I just hope they open up a location in the east valley!  Thanks again Jared!",

The employees do not greet you or even smile.

    "text": "Came here on their grand opening day at around 6:10 PM and proceeded to wait in line and for my food to be ready around one hour later. I don't anticipate the lines to be that long going forward but either way there will probably be a wait for quite some time until more people try out Shake Shack. Anyway I have to say that I was fairly impressed with both the food and service. The people working here were super friendly despite the opening day rush and it was great to see people excited to try out Shake Shack for the first time.  After looking over the menu and what they have to offer I ended up deciding on the Shack Burger, Chicken Shack, Crinkle Cut Fries, and a shake. I know that was a lot to eat through in one sitting but I really wanted to try out as many of their offerings as possible. So far I would have to say that the Shack Burger was my favorite as the burger was of very high quality and it was everything that I expected. I was also impressed with the fries as the outside texture of the fries had a nice crunch to them that most fries don't have. The Chicken Shack was very good as well however I would still prefer to get the Shack Burger over it. Lastly, the shake was nothing too special and will most likely not get a shake next time.  I know a lot of people do compare Shake Shack with In N Out. In the end I do prefer Shake Shack for their burgers and fries however their prices are on the higher end which will deter me from coming here more often. While the burgers here don't look that big they were actually quite filling, so do keep that in mind before placing in the order.",

    "text": "I hadn't been to a Shake Shack before and have always heard it's the East Coast version of In N Out, so I was in the area and thought I'd give it a try-especially because of all the high ratings on yelp. Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out how the ratings are so high and positive. I ordered the Smoke Shack single burger, cheese fries, and the Shack Attack concrete. The burger was ok, but the cherry pepper gave it an extremely strange flavor and the entire burger was pink inside. The cheese fries were the biggest disappointment. I waited probably all of one minute to eat them and by then the cheese was already congealed and turned to nasty chunks. I wouldn't have even ate them but I spent $17 for the whole meal and hated to waste it. The concrete is an absolute rip off. I was expecting it to be like Culver's where it's actually in a shake cup but instead it was like a sad melted single scoop of custard with 5 little pieces of brownie and a few giant chunks of dark chocolate that's so bitter it almost doesn't taste like chocolate. Overall, this is by far one of the worst, waste-of-money meals I have ever consumed. Maybe it's better on the East Coast, but I'll never be back here.",

While the strawberry milkshake was killer, the burger and fries were just ok. My boyfriend loved his Chocolate Cheesecake Milkshake, but we agreed that the quality of the food wasn't worth the price. We both tried the SmokeShack burger, which had spicy peppers, bacon, cheese, and the usual lettuce/tomato/pickle on a potato bun. I appreciate the peppers and the nice pickles they have, but the burger itself left something to be desired. The fries were crispy but lacked flavor or freshness. I would come here for another milkshake, but I'd rather have a burger and fries from somewhere else (like Five Guys), especially considering that I spent $16 for my burger, fries, and milkshake.",

I frequently go to the movies at the Harkins theater in fashion square, and almost always come eat here prior my movie.   My favorite menu items are their ShackBurger (add pickles!) and Chick'n Shack (add cheese!). They somehow manage to perfectly cook the meat and melt the cheese so they are to die for every single time I eat them. The fries are yummy, and they always have interesting lemonade flavors. I'm not the biggest fan of milkshakes and such, but their shakes and custards are actually really good.  The only downside is that they're a liiiiiiittle costly, but I'll happily pay a little more because the quality and taste of their food is excellent.",

    "text": "Hi Shake Shack!!!!   First time Shaker. Certainly not my last.   I'm a lifelong In-N-Out fan.   And the verdict vs. Shake Shack? They don't even compare!!  Seriously - the burgers are worlds different. Shake Shack has a rich potato roll style bun that is vastly different to In-N-Out old fashioned sponge dough. SS even doesn't cut all the way through, which is, quite frankly, brilliant! No more bun sliding!  SS has fresh leaf lettuce and uber fresh sliced onions. The sear on the meat is just perfect as well. Everything just screamed: freshly made burger!   But what really set SS apart was (like In-N-Out) was their service. Even though there was a line, it went quickly. And the guy manning the register was beyond kind and helpful. When my boyfriend asked if they had root beer his response was (oh, let me tell you about this awesome draft root beer we have...) Kind and knowledgeable employees are invaluable!  Shake Shack - I'll be back!",

I love pretty far from this and the drive was nice, now would I say I'll drive 40 mins just to eat here.... ah, I don't think so. However, the meat was very flavorful. They have a sauce on the burger that's like a \"secret sauce\" with red tomatoes in it. The cheese fries were not the greatest. The cheese was similar to cheap nacho cheese that you get at circle k. Now their french fries for themself; tasty. We chose to sit outside because the weather was great. The food was nice, cant go wrong here.",

We both got Shack Stacks (cheeseburger with breaded cheese filled Mushroom patty), fries, fountain drinks, and shared a milkshake. Their burgers were very fresh and good quality ingredients. While the Shack Stack was really tasty, I probably wouldn't get it again. All the cheese coming from the mushroom patty was a little much for me personally, I ended up pulling most of it out. The fries were good, nothing spectacular. The only thing that was disappointing was the $6 milkshake, not worth the price for what is was. The total came out to $40 so this is definitely not something I would get often. I will be back sometime for a regular cheeseburger!",

My husband and I actually first had a taste at the Wine and Food Festival in April and have been meaning to come back here ever since. I dislike that this location is in the mall, simply because parking sucks and no one seems to use their hazards when running inside. Luckily it has its own entrance, and patio seating. I love that the buns are connected on the bottom to make sure that all the goodies stay inside.   I had the \"chick'n shack\", and it was probably the one best chicken sandwiches I've had. We tried the shakes and concretes as well - amazing. Worth the price tag, not something I'd go back to often but would cash out on if that makes sense.",

I have too many good memories of Shake Shack from my time living in NYC - waiting in line from the Times Square location, upper east side, LaGuardia airport, Madison Square Park... so it was so nice to be able to get the same burger in Arizona!   The cheeseburger has high quality meat, the Smoke Shack has awesome bacon in it, but my fav is always the Stack Shack which is the cheeseburger plus fried portobello mushroom! The fried portobello surprisingly has cheese inside the batter, so the cheese would flow out of the fried mushroom and melt in your mouth with the cheese burger. Heaven!   We only waited for less than 10mins in line and there were seats available right away at around 7pm on a Saturday night. Good treat after a movie!   We were too full to have the frozen custard. I usually get the coffee or vanilla flavor! Highly recommend! Don't think about calories and just enjoy.",

They do put a sticker on the outside of the burger warning you that it is going to be HOT.   The employees were friendly and there are a ton of tables to eat at. They even have an outside patio.

After our long wait in line we finally got to order and our meal together for a burger,fries, and a drink was almost $40 alone. Both of our meals were over $15 just for a burger, fries, and a drink. But the food was really good don't get me wrong. But I'm not reviewing the food I'm reviewing the customer service.   They gave us our numbers and they said they'd call the numbers when the food was ready. So about 10 minutes later I hear my number being called so I go up to grab my food and then they called my girlfriends number which was right after mine so I went to grab both to save my girlfriend the walk and the worker slammed her hand on the tray and pulled it away from me and said \"sorry that's not yours\" I simply replied back saying \"it's my girlfriends and you were the one who took our order and gave us the numbers\" and she said rudely \"well she can come get it herself\" and right after that the manger walks over and asks the worker if she's ok like if I just assaulted her or something and not even asking what the problem was. As my girlfriend and I sat down to eat their employees kept walking by us making eye contact and just flat out staring at us, making us uncomfortable.   I have not been back since but I hope the customer service has improved for the future.",

For that price I expected much more in terms of quality. The burger itself was tasty but it was ridiculously small, and the bun was a soggy mess. The crinkle fries were below average and the soda fountain is behind the counter, meaning you have to wait for refills. I did not have a shake and I'm willing to try them, but I'll never waste my money on the food again. Smashburger has much better food, far more toppings, better fries  and is a bit less expensive.

Nothing fancy.  I enjoyed the cheese fries and they had a lot of flavors of shakes/frozen custards. The burgers were pretty good as well.  They have cheeseburgers, chicken burgers, and hot dogs. They do serve beer & wine also.  Overall, it was a-aight, not bad at all.",

There was a little mayo with a hint of paprika in it. The fries were crinkle cut and had some saltiness to it. The strawberry shake was yummy and was easy to drink with a straw. I also had the smoke shack burger, which was spicy and had bacon in it. The restaurant was open to the outside and was very windy. Overall the service was great and the food was outstanding.  I'll definitely be back.",

I ordered a meal consisting of a hamburger fries and a shake, and paid over $20 for it.   It's always hard to compare two places, because it is based on taste, but I know that the five dollar in and out double double tastes better to me then the $10 hamburger from this joint.         I definitely want to say that the staff who was working was awesome, the ambience is really lovely, kind of like an upscale sporty pub kind of vibe.       They have some very interesting food, and if what I had was any indication, it will all be amazing, but be prepared to pay for it.",

    "text": "The Shake Shack started as a food cart in Manhattan just over 10 years ago. Now there are over 60 locations across the U.S. This is the Valley's first location. I have been to ones in both Boston and Chicago and have had mixed reviews. I thought I'd wait a few weeks after their opening to dine here. The service definitely wasn't up to par. The server never smiled and looked very unhappy to be working here. He messed up twice placing my order and each time had to walk away to get a manager key (I was overcharged an extra sandwich). This place is pretty pricey. 2 chicken sandwiches, 2 shakes and an order of fries came to just under $30. My son mentioned the bathroom was trashed (his words). My positive is that the food came out relatively quick and was pretty good. The chicken was still pretty hot and tender. The fries are mediocre but the shakes are really tasty. The restaurant itself is nice looking with indoor and outdoor seating. It wasn't too busy when we got here (Monday night), but I hear the lines can be pretty long on busy days. Thumbs up on food and speed, thumbs down on price and service.",

The burger was small, and I definitely did not like the sauce (In & Out is so much tastier). The chicken sandwich was okay. The fries fine. The shake was nothing I haven't had in the past, and was not overwhelmingly flavorful, in fact is was quite sweet. Perhaps the only good thing about this place is it's location- beautiful outdoor patio seating area, where Modern Steak used to reside. Will not be going here again but needed to provide friends and family with our personal review of our disappointment.  Go to In & Out or Smashburger. You'll be WAY more impressed in the culinary experience.",

East Coast friends who had raved about this place for most of the last decade either have awful taste or must've been talking about somewhere else. Or maybe they never had a burger before.

All the food we had was very good. The chicken might be better than the burger, with the house-made sauce and the breading! The fries were very crispy but still soft inside, it's like fryer magic!  Still, I prefer Culver's to Shake Shack. For one thing, both restaurants have thin patties with crispy edges due to the Maillard reaction, but Culver's are juicier. Then, Culver's has a larger variety of custard flavors (vanilla-to-vanilla comparison, they are comparable but SS is better). And, for the $8 pricetag at Shake Shack for a double cheeseburger, you get a full double cheeseburger COMBO at Culver's!  Still, no complaints whatsoever about the food, so 4*.",

    "text": "I have now tried three different items on the menu and all of them were okay. During my first visit, I obviously ordered the shackburger which was super cute and tiny, a little bigger than my palm. The meat was thin and their sauce is pretty good, but nothing too crazy. On my second visit, I tried the chick n' shack which was also pretty good, but kind of reminded me of Chick Fil A, just a smaller version of it. This last time I tried the shack-cago dog which was honestly super bland. It was falling apart during every bite because the bread was too soft to hold everything up. Their crinkled fries are alright, but they reminded me of the frozen Ore-Ida fries my grandma makes for me.   Overall, this place has a crazy hype, especially in California and the only reason I keep coming back is to take visitors from Los Angeles since we don't have too many locations there. It's worth a try just to say you've had it but there are better burger joints back home. If I end up coming here again I will be ordering one of their shakes!",

Came here on a Saturday when the outside enough was 115+ so the mall was packed and SS was paced as well. Quick ordering a nd we found a seat right away which was very lucky.   Shake shack burger: standard not customer. Lettuce tomato mayo. I should have gotten it with what I like. Be sure to do that. It was kinda bland.   Bacon cheddar: much better. The smoky bacon was very nice and this was a much better burger.   Chicken shack: the best of the bunch. Not as good as chick-Fil-a but good in its own right. Piping hot. Crispy crust. Fresh tasting. Very good.   Regular fries: sort of bland. Could have used more salt or seasoning. Good Potato flavor.   Cheese fries: best of the 2 fries. The cheese was good on these fries and made up for the lack of salt on the plain.   Salted Carmel shake with malt: wow really good. The malt came thru so well. I love that they have a small size. Just right for a desert after burgers and fries.   Place was paved but clean. Service was 5/5. Food was 5/5. The food was 4/5 overall. I feel hopadady burgers is much better.",

Salted Caramel malt shake flavoring was too strong to enjoy, like drinking concentrate. Fries are better than In-N-Out, but I don't like natural fries. Go figure. Docked stars due to price. Would have been less than half this price at In-N-Out.",

It reminds me of In n Out except the meat seems to be a lot bigger and seasoned. I got their double shack burger and i just fell in love. I cant really tell what the Shack sauce is supposed to be and i couldnt really tell it was there. The bun was buttery and soft. The cheese just oozed everywhere. 5/5!  As far as the french fries im not much of a fry person. But these were crispy and perfect. Ugh, you can tell just by looking at them that they are going to be perfect. 5/5!  Try their strawberry mint lemonade its different but soo good!  What i will say though is this place is really over priced.. my meal for a drink, fries and a burger was $17. You pay for everything on the side, nothing comes as a meal which is what makes it so pricey.. be ready to PAY because you most certainly will.  Will i come back? Yes!",

The fried buttermilk chicken sandwich could put chic fil a out of business if it was cheaper. The bun was soft just a little too much lettuce. Although cheese fries were good they can definitely stand on their own without sauce, I will order plain next time. The lemonade was also tasty. Plenty of seating, chill decor, and outside seating.",

The line at this location was pretty long, 15-20 minutes, and I noticed the cash register people are pretty chatty, so that explains it. We got 1 Shackburger ($5.29), bf got a Double Shackburger ($8.09) we split a fries (one size - $2.99), a small soda ($2.30), & fifty/fifty (Arnold palmer essentially - $2.55). All of that $22.91, not bad for lunch for 2 people.   I think for the size of everything though it was pretty pricey, adding one burger patty to make it a double for an extra almost $3, meh. The burger itself was very good, but small, I could have eaten another one.  The bf and I both said we probably would never crave it, and if you wanted more bang for your buck you would go to In-And-Out or something similar.",

    "text": "I happened to stumble upon the infamous Shake Shack while on a family vacation to Arizona and so when I saw this I was so excited to finally get the chance to try it out without having to go to the east coast!    Being from California I've only known of In and Out (and other burger joints smash burger....burger lounge etc) and I've read several comparisons between Shake Shack vs Five Guys vs In and Out.  Upon reading the menu there were several items to choose from.  All their ingredients are all natural no hormones no antibiotics etc etc the new trend in \"natural\" foods.  They use a potato bread which is very soft and in addition to the burgers they have chicken options as week as a shackago-dog.  Shake shack has several shakes to choose from in addition to the standard chocolate, vanilla and strawberry flavors and they sell several custard dessert concoctions to satisfy anyone's sweet tooth craving!  Shake shack also serves a variety of adult beverage options.  I loved shake shack's fries probably because I love crinkle cut fries even though some may say it's similar to eating them straight from a bag of frozen crinkle cut potatoes from the grocery store.  I feel like I'm betraying In and Out by saying that since they have the fresh cut in house fries!  To each their own!  Everyone has their own opinion right?  Shake shack's cheese fries are good but it just tastes like cheese whiz to me nothing fancy but I enjoyed this also!  The meat patty was so juicy and definitely a lot bigger than the other fast food joints.   However, it wasn't as flavorful as other burgers I've had at other fast food joints.  Nonetheless I still did enjoy the burger.  A little pricey in my opinion for the burger, fries and a drink (~$10+) but I guess it is what i would expect or a place that sells fresh high quality ingredients.  I love love loved their strawberry mint lemonade which was their featured flavor of the month.  I hope they open one in San Diego soon because I would definitely want to have it again!",

Update review here.  Tried the new burger - the bacon cheddar burger.  I contend that this burger is superior to the regular Shackburger.  So there's no veggies on this thing.  Just a meat patty, bacon, and a cheddar cheese sauce, not slices.  This is straight up tavern burger, not a typical burger, but all the elements come together better than the regular burger here.  The beef patty, and maybe it was just this time, was less salty.  The saltiness of the bacon (which was also thicker and crisp) seasoned the burger and the slight sweetness of the bun balanced all that out.  The cheese spread, though only lightly tasting of cheddar, made for a good median between all the components, and they put a lot of it into the burger.  So more than the original Shackburger, I would put the cheddar bacon burger almost on par with their chicken burger.  It is a good, quality burger that comes together better than the original.  Cheese fries and vanilla shake were no different than visits past.",

I had  the shack burger, fries and a strawberry mint lemonade.   All were passable but not great. It's not a place where I would crave their burgers or fries. At least not like I do an In 'n Out burger!  I found the burger to be on the smallish side. The meat was flavorful and cooked to perfection. It wasn't a big fat two-fisted burger like I thought it might be. The fries were decent; crispy and a good sized portion.    When our order for 14 people came up, two servers delivered them to our table and went around asking who ordered what. Nice!  I was dreading picking up tray after tray and trying to figure out who ordered what. Thank you for being on the ball staff!  Way to be on top of things.   Not a bad experience, just not the best burger I've ever had.   I'd go back and try something new just to see if I change my mind and will update this review then.",

I knew there had to be some kind of mistake with my order - but I was wrong - it really is that expensive.  I also asked for two cups of water to wash it down - but all they had was a luke-warm serve-yourself nasty tap faucet, and no ice of course.   They do warn you that the burger is \"hot\", but they didn't warn me that the burger would literally explode as soon as you bite into it. No joke. The burger sauce went everywhere - all over my shirt and hand. It was so hot, it actually burned my hand!  After cleaning myself up, 3 bites later I did end up finishing the burger. I must say, it was good. But definitely not good enough to justify $7 for a burger that was closer in size to a slider. I could have eaten 3-4 of them myself - that is, if I could afford it.   Run far away from this place and eat at your nearest in-n-out - twice, for less money.  Or you may even be better off at McDonald's for that matter. At least at McD's they're so generous as to put ice in your water.",

So I was ecstatic to try this East Coast burger joint in Phoenix.  Greeted by their friendly staff I placed my order and waited for the buzzer to alert me. When my order was ready, the bun was smashed and the patty was flappy, thin.  I also ordered the cheese fries which were good but cheese seemed cold.  Just really disappointed.",

We came in a week after they opened, there was a small line but it went super fast. I let my date know about the whole menu and he ordered the smokestack and I ordered the shroomburger, we shared cheese fries and also ordered a coconut shake. My date thought the burger was really good, but that he wasn't sold on the fries. I happen to still love my shroom burger, but could do without the cheese on the fries. The surprising part was how much we both loved the coconut milkshake, with their custard it was seriously amazing! It was like rum chata minus the agonizing hangover the next day.  I have to say that I love the openness and the patio at this location and we only waited 10 minutes for our food but ah.... It's just not the same as the NY locations! I'm still pleased with it enough to go back before a movie though.",

When I got there, I looked at the menu but didn't really care since I always order the same thing, Bacon Cheeseburger with everything plus grilled onions and avocado.   I ordered a bacon cheeseburger please with everything add grilled onions... \"We don't do grilled onions\". Ok, well, add avocado, \"We don't have avocados\". Man, fine then with fries and a small drink.  They gave me a cool small buzzer that said Oh Snap! Buzzed and got my tray.  It looked really small and thought I had ordered a kid's meal but nope that was it. The burger was the size of a glazed donut from Food City. There was a small 1 inch piece of Romaine Lettuce. I looked across the Shake Shack and saw Thirsty Lion. I bet they would have a more spectacular burger than this.  Burger bun - soft Burger patty - medium with a little raw, I should have mentioned to have it well done. Lettuce - it was a joke Pickles and onions - meh Fries - crinkle fries and I really don't care for these but it was the best food at Shake Shack Drink - Coke, meh  This really bummed me out for the rest of the day, like I was cheated, dupped or suckered in. I am glad I went there and tried it out knowing that I will never ever go there again.   Scratch this off my Burger Bucket List.",

    "text": "I like Shake Shack a lot. It was one of the first places I went to eat with my husband (then boyfriend) and I'm emotional so there's that. They were like just becoming popular when I moved out of NY and the only ones I knew of were the one right by my school in Westbury, the one inside Penn Station, and one random one we found one day walking from the Museum of Natural History. And now I know this one, located inside the Scottsdale Fashion Center. This was my first time in Scottsdale, period, and all I have to say is it must be nice to be rich, lol. Anyway, I love that all Shake Shacks have treats themed around whatever area they're in, that's super cute. But Shake Shack was already fairly pricy so once you put one inside of a mall you're dealing with really overpriced burgers and hotdogs. My husband ordered a Shack Burger with regular fries and I ordered cheese fries and a black and white shake. I remember begrudgingly ordering that shake because I KNEW it wasn't going to be $6 worth of shake but to my surprise  the waitress swiped a coupon and I got it for free so thank you, sis! But for $6 I want a lot of shake, I want a shake and that it was not. It was delicious though, my first time ordering a black and white. I love their crinkle fries and I think their cheese sauce is super tasty, my husband is not a fan but he's picky. I have to really be in the mood for a burger to order one but I had a bite of my husband's and I would put the Shack Burger way above any burger from In & Out, Sonic, McDonalds or Burger King, for sure. It even looks fresher. So yay, I'm still a fan and I love the fact that it's so far from my house because if it wasn't I'd probably go more often and that would make the Shake Shack experience not as special for me.",

We got our cheese sauce for the fries on the side so that we could dip it. They were delicious, my son loved it. We didn't like the shake at all. It's a custard shake and we've come to the conclusion that maybe custard isn't for us. Now, for a burger place, this place seemed kind of pricy. It was $24 for what we got. I would come back here if I was in the area and was hungry but I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat here.",

Did they even put any sauce in my burger? I was disappointed with the flavor. The meat patty itself was fine, but everything else about the burger was underwhelming. The price was the final deal breaker for me.  Perhaps the Shack Burger was not the best thing on their menu, but for their signature name burger, it was rather disappointing. I read that some of their other burgers are better and that their shakes are really good, though, so if you try Shake Shack, take a pass on the Shack Burger and get something else.",

Custard - Either it melted during eating meal or was never solid, but this was a soupy mess with pieces of blueberry pie scattered throughout the custard. Prices - About 2 bucks too high on the Burgers, but everything else is normal price.  There was no line at around 1pm. If at the mall, probably would grab another burger, but nothing to go out of the way to eat especially since this area has alot of upgraded burger choices.",

    "text": "First time here and tried a milkshake.  Had a few questions regarding the ingredients of their custards and mix-ins (toppings, pies, and syrups).  The cashiers and runners were friendly and patient; if they did not know the answers to my questions, they made sure to find someone who did-- in this case, the line cook leader (perhaps the manager).  I didn't encounter any impatience nor condescension, which shows me that they take customers with allergies seriously.  Love that!  Wanted to try their CamelShack**, which was made of their vanilla custard, milk, sea salt caramel, and a slice of their banana cream pie, but no one could get the info I needed regarding the pie's ingredients (mainly, if the banana custard filling contained powdered sugar) that afternoon.  The custard and caramel were corn-free, that they knew.  So, the Fair Shake it had to be.  I also wanted (Mast Brothers) dark chocolate chunks mixed in, but their shake machines cannot handle the big chunks of chocolate, so I had to get them on the side.  I enjoyed the thick consistency of the shake- had to use a spoon in the beginning, and still was using it until I finished- as well as the dark chocolate chunks, but I thought that the Fair Trade coffee flavor could've been a lot stronger.  I wonder if they could add a Fair Trade espresso shot, or two in it?  Better yet, throw in some chopped chocolate-covered espresso beans into the mix?  Oh, yeah.  I'd have to order that on the side...  Note to Shake Shack:  Please brew stronger coffee for the custard flavoring AND offer dark chocolate-covered espresso beans as a topping choice!  I'll be back to try a burger and fries and other shake variations!  I wonder if I could just order a scoop, or two of their frozen custards to enjoy?  **5% of sales of CamelShack help support the Phoenix Children's Hospital!  p.s.  The manager promptly responded to my review and said that scoops of custard could be ordered to be enjoyed and not just in shakes and concretes.",

While waiting in line to order however, I was disappointed to see two employees throwing food at each other back and fourth over the line. This is not acceptable. When I asked to speak with a manager the cashier told him/her my complaint but the manager never came to speak to me. I saw the manager ask some of the employees if they were throwing food and of course their answer was no. The food was as good as it was in NYC but with the excitement and rush of customers it appears more training needs to be spent on who is hired.",

When we called the restaurant to speak with the manager, we were once again disappointed as there was only an answering machine, who does that!! We will wait and see if we get a call back. For this price the serving size was terrible as was the overall experience. Want to like them but right now, it a no.",

I am a burger snob and the ratio of bun to burger to sauce to fresh tomatoes and lettuce is absolutely perfect. Everything is so spot on and how a burger should be: from the soft potato bun, to flavorful seared fresh burger patty, and super fresh tomatoes and lettuce to the amazing sauce (the sauce is a bit heavy, but there is a little zing to it and it is the perfect accompaniment to the burger). This burger is everything I had hoped it would be. And the best part is that it doesn't make you feel gross after eating it like some other burgers do. The shakes are ridiculously over priced but also delicious. It is worth the wait in the line and now I understand the lines. My one suggestion would be the ability to put a cheese other than American on the burger.  I had to update my burger list after eating here though: Best burgers in AZ list: new #1) ShakeShack original, 2) Hoppdoddy good nite burger, 3) Rehab Burger Therapy (all of them), 4) Howie Burger at Chelsea Kitchen, 5) Steak and Shake original.

    "text": "We had to go after all the hype!!! and the haters that would say this place is better than In N Out. OK here it is. When I ordered they advised me they didn't have grilled onions or ranch dressing, already started off in a bad way. The burger was on the small side but had great flavor. The bread was really good. I can see how east coast folk can love this place. However in n out is better, by allot. Where they won me over is the fries. The cheese fries were fantastic. The kids got shakes ( because we are healthy that way) and the shakes were good. Final verdict if your near a shake shack try it out it is worth it. If I walked into a food court and I had to pick a burger place.....1. The habit 2. In n out 3. Shake shack. I may go get cheese fries from shake shack then go enjoy a good burger. Let me know what you think when you go!!!!!  I forgot to mention which is kinda important is that I think it was overpriced. We paid 65 bucks for three burgers one chicken Sandwich four fries, two shakes, and one drink. Yelp needs to add a few more of these $$$$ for a burger........In n out here I come",

    "text": "Went here because of all the hype. Not really good. Very basic. Just a fad that will fade. 2 of our burgers were wrong. Hotdog was very small and cheese fries barely had cheese on them. Jack in The box and Carl's Jr have way better shakes than this place. Never going to go again. Waste of money.",

    "text": "THE BURGERS ARE BOMB!  I'm not a huge French fry guy but the fries here rock, made with 100% Yukon gold potatoes. Cheese sauce on them is a must.  The cheese sauce is way better than that bright yellow processed cheese sauce that most places use.  The shake is where this place lost a star. Granted I've only had one, the black & white shake. It wasn't good at all. Tasted like Dairy Queen quality, even though it's not.  They claim it's much better quality, which I believe, but it still tastes like nasty Dairy Queen soft serve. Gross!!!!  Hagen Daz and even Johnny Rockets make much better shakes. The frozen custard sounds interesting, I'll have to try it next time.  Portion sizes & price is where they lost another star. This place isn't cheap. I got a single burger, cheese fries, small lemonade, and one small shake for $20. Damn, what happened to the days when all this cost around $10-$12. And this was a small burger and a very small shake.",

    "text": "First timer tonight, and I was impressed. I am allergic to the protein in beef, and pork so I obviously wasn't coming for the burgers. I have had a million chicken sandwiches, and turkey in every way possible, and they all usually taste the same...eh! I ordered the Chicken Shack, and it was excellent! The buttermilk/mayo combo sauce was what really made it special. It was put together in the proper order, and the bun was excellent. The crispness was just perfect. I added some of the hot sauce that was available (Louisiana hot sauce) and it was perfection. There was a guy who was answering questions and handing out menus while we were waiting in line...and he was so nice, polite, funny, and an asset to the Shake Shack company. I didn't catch his name, but he was working March 9th, 2016 at approx the 7:00p.m hour. Keep him. I will definitely be back. Im eager to try the custard, which I hear is excellent ( recommended by the guy with the menus) Yay, welcome to Arizona. :)",
