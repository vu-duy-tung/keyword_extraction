    "text": "I really, really wanted to like this place. We've given it 3 shots but our experience has been consistent. The first time we stopped in for dinner on a busy evening and sat on the patio. We really enjoyed our wine and tapas meal but our server was incredibly inattentive and we had to chase her down every time we wanted anything. I brushed that off to a really busy night so we returned for a second visit. This time it wasn't that busy so we enjoyed a nice bottle of wine and food. Again, a really inattentive server. When we wanted to check out we literally had to go find her. 3rd try - stopped in for a glass of wine in the early evening. Unfortunately the 3rd visit was the worst. I asked the server if they had happy hour specials and she informed me that yes and we had just made it with 10 minutes left. When we were ready to order we couldn't find her anywhere so went to the bar hoping to make the happy hour deadline. She then came to the table and took our order. 30 seconds later she comes back telling us \"Sorry, you missed the cut-off for happy hour\".....yeah, we missed it because you never came back! Grrrr......We received our wine and waited for our food (we only ordered two really simple appetizers)...and waited....and waited. No one came by so we went up to the bar again to ask about our food. When our server came back she said sorry but our deep fryer broke today and we had to run out to Kohl's and buy a little fryer and that big table was ahead of you. Seriously???? It's bad enough that they are cooking with a Fry Daddy but never never tell your customers something like that.  After 40 full minutes we received our appetizers, our wine glasses empty. No, she didn't ask if we wanted another glass. She then came back to tell us that her shift was over but no worries, that other girl will take care of you. \"That other girl\" never came by....ever. We had to go up to the bar once again and ask for our check. I fully expected a discount because of the fiasco but no. Not even an apology. So I told them our experience and the manager came over. She said she was happy to take off one appetizer. Great. Except she talked a little too long about all the problems they were having in the kitchen today. So we waited for our revised bill....and waited....and waited. Are you kidding me? We had to go up to the bar to get the check. It's a nice little wine bar with pretty good food but 3 strikes and you are out. We will not return here. Very unfortunate for us and them.",

    "text": "I have to agree with other Yelpers that this place is unpretentious, but it would only get two stars if I didn't admire its chutzpah for staying in business so many years and I honest to god, have no idea how.   My friends and I come in here now and again for a post happy hour glass of wine and that's always a two-hour minimum visit. Not that we're trying to get out quickly, but there's a point where it gets absurd. Here's a little example. P and I came in one rainy night around 7:30. It wasn't too busy and we found some nice, comfy seats and waited for a waitress to bring us some menus. And waited. And waited. Don't forget, they're not busy. Twenty minutes later a friendly waitress comes by (they're always friendly, haven't had a knowledgeable one yet, but they're always friendly) with some menus. Another ten or fifteen minutes she comes back to take our order. P had a question about one of the wines so the waitress offered her a taste of it. How nice! Another ten minutes she brought me my glass and P's taste and mentioned that they opened a bottle just for her taste. Unfortunately, P didn't like the wine at all (if I remember right, it was on the list in the wrong place, and P was looking for something much, much different) so instead of waiting again she russion-rouletted it and just ordered something. It came, we chatted and enjoyed our evening and she catches my eye and nods at the next table. it seems they have ordered the wine P didn't like and the waitress stands at the table popping the cork out with great flourish saying, \"here's the bottle of wine you ordered\". Why no one questioned it not needed to be uncorked, I don't know. It's a classy place like that though (underlying sarcasm). My Wine Cellar I mean. Not the poor suckers next to us paying top dollar for an opened bottle of wine with a pour missing from it.   I guess I feel a sort of affection for My Wine Cellar. The same sort of affection you would feel for your \"special\" cousin. The one that can't seem to move out of your aunt and uncle's house and never seems to make smart life decisions. Oh, I know we've all got one. You want to strangle him in one breathe but the next you can't because he's always got such a sweet grin on his face and small animals really seem to take to him. A lot. Anyway, My Wine Cellar is right here in Ahwatukee and they have survived and you can go and have a glass of wine and just hang out. Reasons like that keep bringing me back. Once I'm there I don't know why I came, but I keep coming back.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try this place out because I had heard such great things. My husband and I decided to pick this place for our date night a few Saturdays ago. We arrived at about 5:50 (10 minutes before Happy Hour ended) We thought we would order a glass of wine each and a brushetta board before HH wrapped up and then order off the menu. We sat until 6:08 before someone finally greeted us. It was super awkward too because every server kept looking at us and making eye contact but no one ever cared to come by and get a drink order. Finally greeted,  I asked the waitress if we could order a few items from the HH menu because we sat down prior to it ending - she acted as if I was asking for too much \"Ummmm I can't access those buttons after 6pm I'll see if that's even possible\" as if I was in the wrong for asking! Our brushetta came out promptly however, it was much less in taste then I expected. They only had 4 selections and you picked 3 to complete your board - not much variety. The tomatoes were slimy to the point I had to undress each piece just to stomach it. Wasn't pleased. I ordered the prosciutto and brie flatbread and my husband had the salmon cakes - both were good.   I most likely will not return to this place due to the lacking service and experience and the food being just OK. Hopefully I was there on an off night.",

The owners are great. I think every time I have been there(a lot) one of them has stopped by to say hi and make sure everything was great. I know this place has just transferred ownership, and MAN they are doing everything right. It was good when I first started going, and now it is GREAT!

Turns out that there really is no need for reservations on a Saturday evening at 5pm.  Place only had a couple people in it.  I do think it is nice that they have happy hour specials on a Saturday until 6.  Woo Hoo.   I tried two glasses of white HH wine.  I did not care for the chardonnay at all.  I felt like I was drinking fruit juice.  Then I was going to try the one from Spain.  The waitress brought me a sample and I hated it - reminded me of baby powder for some odd reason.  So I tried a glass of the reisling.  I really liked it!!  For food we tried many things.  The french fries with no bacon.  They were delicious fries but I did not like the aoli.  I am just not a fan of mayonnaise based sauces.  The chick peas were my favorite appetizer that we tried.  It really grew on me and I didn't think I liked chick peas.  We also tried the bruschetta.  I had the one with brie, carmelized onions and apple.  It was okay.  I wouldn't order it again.  It was skimpy on the bri and the bread was a boring wheat flavor to me.  The onions were delicious though.  Also tried the brussell sprouts and wasn't impressed.  To al dente to me and I am not a fan of black pepper.  Also got  the house made pasta and it was really delicious.  I highly recommend it!  Live music started at 7pm but it was hard to hear from the side of the restaurant we were on.",

We ordered the regular fries with house made Curry Ketchup, delicious! We also ordered a charcuterie board, which came with bread, house made pickled veggies, and we nailed picking out the best cheeses and meats (they have a great selection to choose from), BUT the best thing on the board was the house made jalapeno JAM!! I literally asked Deena for a jar to go!! And of course, their wine selection is great, I love trying new Chardonnays and they have a full selection. We will be coming back to try more snacks and listen to the live music on the weekends. Another great find!",

My Wine Cellar is the first stop. My guest and I sat at the bar.  We ordered a few drinks.... we ordered a few drinks....I said we ORDERED A FEW DRINKS!  Oh there you are! For a minute there I was getting thirsty. Granted big party was \"in da house\" out back rockin' away, but really I'm sitting at the bar. I can reach over to pour my own drink if that is fine.    We ordered some roasted Brussel Sprouts, Classic Pizza, Fries, and Hummus.  Brussel Sprouts were good, Fries were greasy, Classic Pizza -- well was classic and the Hummus was good minus the rock bread we ate it with.  Only thing I dig so far about this place is the ambience.  I love the outdoor patio overlooking the green grass and the band gave it a Jazzy feel.  I think they should invest in more couches, but that's just my opinion. - Enjoy!",

Carrots on veggie plate were both burnt and raw at the same time (this takes True skill at disrespecting food)   The salad was reasonable;but again, chicken seemed to be leftover microwaved bits and pieces from some earlier attempt at drying chicken.  The wine selection is laughable for a place with wine in the name. Some places make their money with excellent food and wine. This place makes money charging $40 for a $8 bottle of wine. Pathetic.

The food is great on par with a bit of everything.  I luv the chicken and Mac of the  day.  Oh and the lobster bisque makes my mouth water.   Their wine club is a good way to try new wines and meet kindred spirits. Her special events are always gorgeous and exceed any expectations. Recently attended the Fall Harvest pairing, who knew, a pumpkin wine!   Beer buffs are not left out.  A great selection and pumpkin porter, while it lasts.   So, stroll on in and be sure to have plenty of time to savor every moment.  Also, music nights are eclectic, each musician will strike a positive chord with you.  Eat, drink and be merry.",

They ran out of the wine that was on special, so our server brought a sample of another wine that she thought I might like. For dessert, we had the affogato, which is ice cream in a little cup of espresso. It was very tasty. We left feeling satisfied, but not stuffed.

Walked up to have an appetizer and all of the doors were open so we walked in. The lady working turned us away because we were 14 mins early before they open. Don't open the doors if you don't want customers! Or at least invite us in to wait.",

They have a reasonable selection of white and red wines, beers and other spirits. The waitress was nice and really attentive although on a Wednesday, there weren't a ton of people. We ordered the cellar fries and the board of meats and cheeses (I forgot the exact name), but they were amazing. That jalapeno jam is to die for and I've now expanded my palette to the cheese realm. Thanks!  They were opening a patio space expected to open sometime this week. I think that's a great addition especially with cooler weather. We will definitely be back again!",

Not much to look at from the outside, so it is easy to miss.  We had a wonderful time!  We each had 2 glasses of wine at Happy Hour prices, 2 glasses of a nice Merlot at $5 each, 1 Pinot Noir for $6 and another Pinot for $10.  All four glasses were generous pours, and we enjoyed them all.  The appetizers were fabulous!  We shared a baked goat cheese with tomato jam as well as the fried chicken.  Both were very generous portions, and the tastes were divine.  There is live music on Fri and Sat nights.  We're already planning to go back this weekend.",

New owners took over November '11 and the vibe has changed for the better.  The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly.  Its the kind of place you can go to alone and make immediate friends with the other customers and the staff.  The wine list has greatly improved and since they brought in a new chef (Sarah) the food is absolutely mouth watering.    They have a great happy hour on food and wine and their regular Saturday tastings are a great way to find new and different wines.  The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the wines they serve, which helps make a great wine bar.  Fantastic patio with live music on the weekends - this is the perfect spot for a group of friends or date night.  I'm starting to become a regular and I don't even live close by.",

I love the bruschetta, particularly the brie, apple and caramelized onions - delicious!  The staff has always been incredibly friendly and attentive. I sit on the patio almost every time and love it. They have lights strung across the patio and it gives a great ambiance in the evening. I've been on a Saturday night before and they had live entertainment - just a guy and his guitar - and it was the perfect touch to the already amazing atmosphere.  I also attended a networking event here for women in my industry and they handled it perfectly. The staff was spot on, offered perfect little bites and made it a very enjoyable event.

They sell wine by the glass and by the bottle, and the prices vary from reasonable to expensive. They also have a small section for wine knick knacks, like wine stoppers, etc.  Selection is limited and small, prices are okay.  They have some glassware as well, and some of it is really expensive...I saw a wine decanter for like $125!!  yikes.   I reccomend this place for a variety of reasons. First, the staff is awesome, and are totally educated.  Its a wonderfully relaxed enviroment, and its someplace you can go by yourself too, take a date, or just meet up with people for wine or beer.  clean, nice etc.  Its a wonderfully relaxing place to spend any evening.  The down side?  Don't bother eating here.  Stick to the wine when going.  Food here, I think, is okay, and overpriced.  Its a wine bar, not a resturant.  Also, I think they lack variety in things other then wines, like glassware which you can get at Ikea or Walmart anyways.  Plus, the owner lady is always there.  She has short hair and is rather loud.  She knows her stuff tho.",

    "text": "I have been to My Wine Cellar a few times since the change in ownership and I have to say I'm still not sure what to think. I love the idea of a cozy wine bar just a few blocks from my house and that is what this place seems to be. I walk in and the atmosphere is quite cozy and even though there is not a huge crowd of people. The bar is usually full enough and everyone is chatting and appears to be having a good time. Even though the staff is welcoming, I still get this feeling like I'm an \"outsider\" and not quite a \"regular\" yet. Can't really place my finger on why.  The happy hour prices and selection for beer and wine are fantastic! Full price would be a little more than I would like to spend, but then again I love a good deal so anything \"full price\" just seems like I'm missing out. We used Living Social coupon a few days before the expiration and were a little bummed that the coupon wasn't good for the happy hour prices. I know this is somewhat typical, however that just makes the restaurants that DO allow the coupons during happy stand out that much more!  In the time that I have had food (after the ownership change and before), I think it is obvious this place is all about the wine and the food is an afterthought. Nothing wrong with that. I think it is necessary to offer food if you want people to stay and drink a while; we've got to have something to snack on! Bruschettas, thin and crispy pizzas, and salads all with great descriptions on the menu, but the execution leave a little to be desired. Some of the appetizers taste like I could have just gone to Trader Joe's or Costco and purchased the same thing myself.  I promise I am not trying to make this sound bad, I will go back to the wine cellar when I want to relax (but not at home, but not too far away either) with a good glass of wine and a calm, cozy atmosphere. I do like to go there, but I think I like the idea more than the reality. It seems as if there is some unrealized potential at the wine cellar, or maybe that is just the optimist in me. The lesson here is that I will be sure to go during the \"happy\" hours and I won't go when I'm hungry.",

I like that I can try something new but also count on that my favorites will still be available. ( I still like to reminisce about the \"Thanksgiving Mac and Cheese\"  special they ran last November.  Seriously, it was that good.)  They have live music with some amazing artists on Friday and Saturday nights and wine club is so much fun too.  I love how welcoming the staff are and you truly feel like you belong there and are treated like royalty.   And if you're looking for the best Al Fresco dining in the area, look no further. I can't wait for patio season!!   If you're looking for your go to wine bar, give them a try.  I really love this place!",

    "text": "I've been to My Wine Cellar previously & wasn't very impressed with the experience. Since our friends wanted to try it out, we decided to go back. It was not at all busy when we went & were told we could sit at any table. We really wanted to sit outside but were warned that there's a golf course behind the restaurant, thus there is a mosquito problem.  We grabbed a table & our waiter came to greet us & take our drink order right away. I thought it was disgusting that he acknowledged that there was a mosquito squashed on the page of the menu but gave it to me anyway. I think that it wouldn't have taken much effort to go grab another menu. It was his first day I guess.  We got the Oatmeal Stout beer & the pink Moscato for drinks and the bistro burger & the salmon cakes for our meal. Both of the food dishes were good. The bistro burger was large & filling and the side of fries was also tasty. I think for the price we paid for the salmon cakes, it would've been nice to get an actual side instead of just the spring greens.  The service was fine. I've been to wine bars before & enjoyed them more so I doubt we will be back.",

The Wine Cellar is tucked away off Warner Rd and the I-10. The welcoming staff, dim lights and display of artwork on the walls gives it a nice neighborhood ambiance. They have a large selection of boutique wines and craft beers. Behind the restaurant is a outdoor patio area with occasional live music. Its relaxing atmosphere makes it a great place for a date night or a quiet night out with friends. I've always enjoyed their selection of wines. They have some wine flights to choose from or you can order by the glass or bottle. I haven't had many opportunities to try their food. I went on a Wednesday and got their bottle of wine and flatbread for $25 (they have different specials on weekdays). I got the brie and prosciutto flatbread and thought it was pretty good. They also offer a wine club for regulars and 101 classes for those wanting to learn more about wine. Parking can a little tight up in the front but definitely a great place to stop if in the area.",

(But not sure they'd be worth the regular price of $8 as it's a small portion.  we paid $6.)  We also enjoyed the mixed olives.   The turn-off was: yelp \"check in offer\" is \"free house snack.\" Sounds special.  It was popcorn. Unfortunately it not only was a tiny portion, (which, as soon as we tasted, was no problem!) but also, it was cold and soft-spongy-stale. Seems if you offer something, you'd make an effort for it not to be an afterthought and disappointment.   We always try HH & then decide if we continue on w/ordering dinner & in this case, we passed.   Great for a nice HH $5 glass (it's $5 & up) & view of lawn. I'm sure live music also adds to atmosphere.",

I love Pinot Noir so every time I go to any wine bars I love trying them. I ordered the Apaltagua Reserva. It went down so smoothly. The good news is when you check in you get a free wine tasting! The second one I chose was the Rainstorm. This one was also tasty but has more of a kick to it since there's cinnamon in it.   I really liked this place. Everything was delicious and the staff is beyond friendly. They REALLY know their wines! Not to mention they have so many other \"festivities there!

Other than that, getting our food was exceptionally slow, like 45 minutes to get a small charcuterie plate with a few slices of cold cuts, some pickles, 4 slices of cheese and some bread.  Ridiculous.  Wen I asked the waitress what the problem was, she had the temerity to say that there were a number of people ordering food and their kitchen could not cope.  Hogwash!!  There were other tables who arrived after us and were served their food before us, mostly foods that required more extensive preparation than our charcuterie plate.  The wine list is miniscule by any accounting for a \"wine bar\".  Prices are too high for the quantity and quality of the food.  There was a young woman playing a guitar and singing.  Late of course.  Give it a miss.",

First, their hours diminished dramatically, so much that, if you aren't there for a happy hour or an early dinner, you're out of luck.  Closing at 9 PM on a Saturday just enticed me to skip over the place entirely and make an evening out of it somewhere else.  Then, although admittedly, their first priority is wine, they took Shiner Bock off of the tap selections.  Finally, their quality of food went from 'notable' to 'forgettable', so much so, that I stopped ordering their specialties and went strictly with pizza.  While their pizza is quite tasty, there is a cap on the amount of pizza-and-wine dinners one can have weekly, which was about the amount of time I put in there over the past few years.  That being said, you should support this place based on their discriminant selections of wine.  While its not a bad place to grab a glass of wine, you'd better get there early.",

We have been going to this place for years both in the newer location and the original one down the street.  The owners Tommy and Kathleen have NEVER strayed us wrong when we look for certain bottles of wine.    Yes you will pay more than if you go to Costco or Cost Plus but I can't remember the last time either of those had a knowledgeable sales staff that remembers that I like sweeter white wines or big full bodied reds but not Merlot.  (Although I do remember the Costco lady handing me a 2nd free sample of crackers once....)  Yes it can get loud.  Yes the owners are warm and friendly.  Go a few times and you will become one of the family.  They have great wine makers who stop in an do tastings.  When was the last time you saw Mark Mondavi (Charles Krug winery - nephew of Robert) at your small wine store?      Their prices range from 7-12 a glass of wine and 20-200 for a bottle.  You may find it cool in there (hey it IS a WINE store and with that much inventory you wouldn't want it to go bad in a warm place!) so bring a light sweater of jacket.",

We order some wine - mind you there was no recommendation or comment on our choice. Whatever. Then we order some bruschetta based appetizers and gnocchi and soup. Bruschetta arrives and i am real disappointed that its just a bruschetta bread sliced real thick and not even toasted. How not cool.  Then gnocchi arrives. It tasted ok but was cold in some parts and kinda skimpy on sauce. Is it possible it was nuked? By that time 2 man band started to play. They were pretty good and played some soft rock and country without overpowering whole place, like it often happens. But wait, why talk of the band if food review if not over, was not there soup involved? Hehe we wondered what happened to that as well. \"Oppps, you right\". Few minutes after our reminder it came. And not it was not worse the wait :( Too bland, too sweet. Not that great after all.  We also got coffee and desert. Both were alright but nothing to write home about. Just ok.  Perhaps, if you come there with a few friends, do not care much about food and just drink the wine and listen to music it would be much better. We came there for a dinner and wine. Wine was good, dinner was not.  This place barely gets 3 stars from me. I am pretty sure i aint coming back either. Bleah.  \"I no like\"  Eugene",

    "text": "Decent place, friendly staff, but poor wine list.  I asked the staff about the list and was told the owners only want to carry wines that nobody else does.  My guess is that they want to carry wines that you are not familiar with so you don't know how badly you are getting ripped off.  I had a $10 glass of a $11 bottle of wine (retail).  It was ok, and I expect high prices at a bar but I at least want a decent glass.",

    "text": "This is my first to visit this place, though I've passed it several times. My friend and I just finished having days from HELL  at work and we needed some vino to soothe our frayed nerves. I suggested going here to give it a try and also for a change of scenery. Upon walking in, we were greeted warmly. We sat ourselves on two really squishy couches (not comfy). Well, we got our wine order and were left to chat. First thing I noticed, the music. I began to contemplate whether or not  \"It takes two\" by Robb Base was a good music selection while trying to unwind and chill with a glass of sauvignon blanc..hmm I'm still thinking no. Second thing I noticed was that the really young servers and bartenders were talking about deep issues of the world, but it was the explicative shouted out by the bartender who was making a very serious point, that caught our attention. I believe my friend said \"Classsssy!\" in response. So I guess that if you want to chill and have a mellow chat, My Wine Cellar is maybe not the place for it. Maybe it was an off day I don't know. On to the wine prices. I've never seen a wine bar that had all one price for all the wines on their list. It's silly. Really. And the happy hour prices aren't that wonderful. The glasses are 10 dollars, but at happy hour they're 8. Not that big of a price break considering 8 bucks is usually a regular priced glass of wine elsewhere. Just an observation. Food... not spectacular. We sent back the hummus platter we ordered because the bread was COLD, I mean out of the fridge, slap it on the plate cold. The hummus was just not tasty at all. And I LOVE hummus. We then got the bruscetta platter, we ordered the basil, tomato,mozzarella, and the sun dried tomato with goat cheese. Both were very tasty. Then we moved on to the chicken sticks with lemon grass. Not my favorite. YES you CAN have too much lemongrass. I don't know if we'll go back to visit My Wine Cellar. I doubt it. At least we gave it the good college try.",

I say that a bit sarcastically - as I always get a bit ahead of myself and pick out a great wine because really, life is to short to drink bad wine!  My husband rolls his eyes when I suggest Lucy's cause I am not a cheap date there, but he likes it too. He even threw a surprise bday party for me there, recently - and it was all perfect. The back patio is super when the weather is nice, and they have cozy couches inside, or a table if you prefer. Check it out, it's fun!",

However- the Moscato I tried was so crisp and refreshing, I was blown away. I tried the lobster bisque, which reminded me of when I lived in Louisiana it was so good. My friend had the Mac n cheese which was rich and yummy. We also tried the truffle fries (delicious!) and yes we tried the bacon wrapped dates- I read so many reviews to give them a try, and l don't even like dates and I'm not a bacon fanatic, but it was well cooked, creamy on the inside and bacon-y on the outside. (Is bacon-y a word? Not underdone and not overdone- just right.) Now I'm hankering for more of that effervescent nectar- of-the- gods Moscato. Can't wait to visit this little gem of a place again!",

Ashley is just adorable and so friendly and welcoming.  I hope her Boss/managers know how fortunate they are to have her.  The ambience is so warm with low lighting,small candles and flowers on every table which makes for memorable moments.  The decor is highly tasteful from the color scheme, the gorgeous view of the patio from inside,  the wall decor to the spotless and pretty restrooms.  I look at everything!   The wine choice is extensive and the menu divine.  Ashley knows everything about the beverage and food menus, so ask her for details! We had the charcuterie and lobster bisque- both amazing!  Presentation of food and wine shows pride and care in everything that I witnessed coming out of their kitchen.  Prices are competitive and one doesn't feel \"spenders remorse\" at all!  It's just lovely and I will definitely be back.  Thank you Ashley and \"My Wine Cellar\"!",

There's a bar right at the entrance and didn't immediately see a greeter or tables for seating. The folks directed us around the corner and we were told to sit anywhere. Since it was gorgeous outside, we opted for the patio which overlooks the golf course.  Very few tables had umbrellas but since it was overcast no big deal. There were couches as well as tables plus gas heaters for chillier weather. Service was prompt and friendly. The Hubs got a beet salad with generous portions of beets, goat cheese and pistachios. I got the charcuterie with two cheeses, toasted bread, jalapeno jam, pickled onions and caper berries. It was beautifully composed and delicious. I could have used another piece or two of the bread since I had a bit of jam left and it was so good. I also got the Sake Mule- it tasted like a limey ginger ale and was very refreshing. I would definitely order it again. We skipped dessert as we needed to be somewhere else and we needed to get going. I would go back with girlfriends or my daughter, The Hubs was unimpressed so that's why it's 4 stars. He's not a drinker or small plate kind of guy but did agree to go where I wanted to, lol!",

And live music?! I was sold. With a thin strand of lights placed above the windows, this was the perfect way to wind down from a day of sightseeing.   Because we weren't incredibly hungry, we opted for a few of their small plate options. We first opted for the Seared Shrimp + Kimchi Salsa, which included a rainbow carrot salad. Realizing we were still hungry, we then ordered a flatbread called \"The Livin' Easy,\" which had chef's barbeque sauce, chicken, red onion and cilantro. It's really hard to go wrong with ordering flatbreads ...  Both were delicious, but we were really hoping the Seared Shrimp + Kimchi Salsa would have been a LITTLE bit bigger considering it was under the \"shared plates\" category. Even so, we were both very pleased.   As for the wine, they had everything your little heard could desire. I'm going say something that will surely offend the wine enthusiast reading this (although I DO love wine!), but I can't for the life of me remember the name of the wine we ended up getting. haha I know I first had my eyes set on The Curator, which was a Shiraz, but they were out. Thankfully our waitress was quick to find an earthy red for us that we both loved. And that's what I'll remember ... it was super tasty!   All in all, it was a lovely experience and the live music really topped off the night.",

The menu looked quite amazing actually. I walked in here with absolutely no expectations of food but that quickly changed when I scanned through a rather comprehensive list of food items that they had to offer. We both picked a glass of wine each, which were $2 off because of happy hour. We decided to start with an order of French onion dumplings and truffle fries. The dumplings were perfectly done.. with crispy edges on the exterior and a beautifully cheesy filling. They serve it with au jus which we chose not to pour on over the dumplings. Instead, we opened them just enough to pour the jus directly inside them individually. Best. Decision. Ever. The flavors with spot on and the crunch from the dumpling wrapper was a really nice touch.   The fries however fell really short. They were cut really thick and didn't get enough time in the fryer. They turned out soggy and limp.. quite easily one of the worst I've had. My disappointment kinda fell on the wayside because I was still savoring the wine and dumplings. We walked out feeling pretty good about this place. I would definitely return.",

Something that was also amazing is that they had folktale winery from Monterey and they did not even upcharge the bottle!  This shows a honest business as well!  Usually bottles are double what they are worth or even triple sometimes.  This place does it right! Their hazelnut chocolate cake is to die for!  (And I am not a hazelnut cake gal).

The wine selection is amazing and the service staff are all very knowledgeable if you need helping finding something delicious! To top it all off the food is out of this world!! You have to start off with the charcuterie board and steamed olives (I had no idea olives were so good served warm!!) And then try any of the amazing starters like bacon wrapped dates, tempura cauliflower or the French onion wontons before moving on to one of the main dishes that are ever changing!!   This place has it all and the perfect ambiance for a fun evening Out!  You must check it out...and, no doubt, you'll be back again soon!!",

Came back here a few months ago, and BAM, fell in love.  I'm definitely not a regular, but for the most part, the staff does remember me (which, hell anyone's gotta admit is nice) and I've brought several new people with me.  My understanding is that there's also a new chef? Not sure, but holyCOW the food is delicious now. Had some salmon patties a few weeks back, and cannot wait to go back for them again.  Need to try the Nutella desserts I was told about too. I will say I generally go during HH, because the prices are a littttlle too much otherwise.",

    "text": "My Wine Cellar is the retail half of Lucy's Place, which is the \"wine bar.\" Together, they offer you a bit of everything - from a plethora of wine to purchase and take home to a menu that sells by the glass. Pair their chardonnay or pinot noir with a bruschetta or caprese salad appetizer, and you'll find yourself in palette nirvana.   The place boasts a cozy, off-the-beaten-path feel. You walk in and are immediately transported to a more relaxed, come-as-you-are, drink-as-much-as-you-want atmosphere that offers dining tables, comfy chairs and couches and a short bar. Inside the colors are True to wine bar standards - on the dark side, encouraging to just let your tense shoulders relax. Lucy's place is a delightful find - a hard throw away from the trendy places you'll find in strip malls or in popular Scottsdale locations. In fact, it's nowhere near Scottsdale, nor does it pretend to be anything except what it is - a wine bar that offers you a wide selection, impeccable service and an atmosphere you aren't quick to leave.   When I went, they had live acoustic music - a one man show playing the likes of Ryan Adams and Wilco. It was the perfect addition to a satisfying happy hour experience.   Plus, Lucy has a couple small TVs hanging in view, in case you need to catch the baseball scores (it so happened to be turned onto the Red Sox game).   I didn't want to leave. That in and of itself tells me Lucy's Place is a rare find. I'd give it 5 stars if it were in my neighborhood. It's a short trek southward, but definitely worth a regular visit if you're in the area or just in the mood for wine that'll satiate your palette, along with a relaxed atmosphere that'll assuage your workday woes.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmy-wine-cellar.com%2Flucys_place.htm&s=075d8e6eeef868f0c61e4cec820251ceb857a93c422e05c81659f35a1546e9c0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">my-wine-cellar.com/lucys...</a>",

Whether you're looking for a fantastic bottle to take home or you want to munch on cheese and crackers while you drink and converse, My Wine Cellar has you covered.  The retail portion of the restaurant is really excellent, the walls lined with a huge selection of reds and whites.    If you're intimidated by the selection or are a beginning wino, the restaurant offers \"wine education\" courses.  My fiance and I attended a weekly \"Wine 101\" course a couple of years back.  Each week, we sampled a different genre of wine including reds, whites, dessert wines, and champagnes.  Also, each week included a guest speaker, usually a sales rep for a wine maker.  Lots of fun and I learned a huge amount of information!",

It's like why would one bring friends, tell the owner throughout the dinner that the food is perfect, and then turn around and write a poor review? I wish I could weed those people and their reviews out of Yelp. So there you have it: I am after you (and you know who you are); after you with my objective reviews. My Wine Cellar is a place worthy of your attention. Tucked away in Ahwatukee Foothills and is worthy your attention. This place has a spirit, a personality, amazing staff and always changing scenery of foods, music, wines, social activities, people from all over the country borough together for the love of company or merely wanting to relax after a busy day in the city. I first discovered this place through Yelp and thanks to your reviews. I am a picky SOB born and raised in Europe and spoiled by wonders of Pacific NW. I am Anton from Ratatouille if you wish, and I found my joy in My Wine Cellar's wine club and meeting its members, participating in all social activities. So shall you! Please come and enjoy yourselves here. Phoenix is culturally a young city. Finding city gems is a treasure hunt for me. Love My Wine Cellar!",

The heat lamps help some, but if its cold, not even the wine can take away the chill! But they have blankets! :)  I have not sampled their food menu but the wine choices I had were great! I sampled all reds I wish I could remember the one wine I tried that had a funny name. Oh well! I will go again and remember what it was from the menu and update this review!   If you want some place different to go, then you will find this place well deserving of a visit! And make sure you you stop inside to look at the huge wine selection they have! It is very well organized! And you will find probably just about anything you are looking for in wine! If its not there, I'd be surprised!",

Our food was very tasty. It all arrived promptly too.  We were on the hungrier side so had a variety of things such as the meat and cheese platter, flatbread pizza, salmon dish and dessert. YUMMMY!

I can get a little bit of everything and not waste so much food.  The ambience is elegant and pleasant. Not too loud either so you don't have to yell to have a conversation.  Service:   Staff was friendly and the people at the wine bar welcome you with a smile right as you walk in. My friend comes here often so they knew her by name, which is nice that they appreciate their frequent customers.   Appetizers:  *Tempura cauliflower* crispy and served with a side sauce.   *Bacon wrapped Dates* - served with a side of grapes, this appetizer is simple, yet tastes so gourmet. It's soaked in a maple sauce that pairs perfectly with the bacon. Even the grapes are drenched in the maple sauce. Yumminess. The dates are so creamy. I ate these with a knife and fork as they're piping hot when they're served. The bacon is crispy and slightly chewy. Not too thick or thin, wrapped securely around a slightly firm date that oozes out when you bite into it.   *Cheese Platter* I ordered the asiago walnut cheese I believe which is a sharp cheddar cheese. The cheese comes out in cubes and is served with a couple slices of bread, olives, and their homemade jalapeno jam that is mouthwateringly delicious!   Wine:  They have specials everyday. They make their own blends of wine and from what I remember of what I had was a Red Blend of Zinfandel, Cabernet, and a few other different types of wine. It had a lovely peppery flavor to it. Not too sweet, which is what I look for in wine.  I highly recommend this place for a girls night/date night. It's definitely a \"boujier\" and popular spot among locals. I'll definitely have to check out   a whole charcuterie board to share with a friend with some glasses of wine.",

The wine selection was broad and the cocktails all sounded delicious. The restaurant was quiet and relaxed. My husband had the Japanese mule (sake, ginger beer, and lime) and he said it was smooth and very flavorful- it also came in a tall stout glass so you get a lot for your money. We shared the panna cotta and it was divine! The thick panna cotta is topped with pistachio chunks and drizzled with honey and I can't recommend it enough! Their happy hour menu looked decent- $2 off wine and beer from 3-6. All in all we loved this place and will definitely be back for more!",

It takes a little for her to respond but being respectful of her time should also be taken into consideration.   The food is always amazing, I love the charcuterie boards and the wines they have listed on the menus.

It spreaded on the bread nicely. The prosciutto and salami tasted good with the goat cheese and complemented my wine nicely since the Zinfandel is a red wine that is fruity and leaves a dry finish.

    "text": "Ughhh...this review has been a long time coming. I have mixed feelings about this Wine Bar, which is sad because I used to LOVE this spot ;/ I'am a frequent customer here and have been for many years. I bring a good amount of business to this place and I really feel like since new ownership/manager has changed to Stephanie this place just hasn't been the same. Zoya the previous owner/manager had a lot more events and was involved a lot more with the community. This was very important to many of the residents who live in the Awhatukee area and I see them now getting less business and return customers due to lack of activities and involvement with Phoenix. Example - current manager doesn't participate in AZ Restaurant Week. Zoya did every year and it was great deal for $33 and included a glass of wine of your choosing. This was always something myself and many girlfriends would look forward to in May and September every year.   One thing that really doesn't sit well with me is the communication or lack thereof. It seems this has been mentioned in several other reviews since management has changed. When you email them to make a reservation, ask a question or want details about something the response time is ridiculous (if you even get one). At least a week, if not more and when you respond back forget about receiving an answer especially if they don't like what you are requesting or don't have an answer. 100% of the time there are two people who will check/respond to emails Stephanie or Shannon Rush.   When you have \"Weekly Happenings\" everyday of the week and it is switched up every month, please update your website or at least let your returning customers know about the updates/changes. Example - Tuesdays they have Blind Tastings. For the month of August it was Rose's and every month it is supposed to change to a different kind/type of wine. I called on August 31st and was told they do not do blind tastings on Tuesdays and I said yes you do, I just did one last Tuesday with some friends. The lady then responds with, \"well we don't know what's happening for the month of September yet\". I'm sitting here thinking to myself how am I telling the person who works there (mind you there is not many employees here, maybe slightly more than a handful) what there own restaurant is doing. This makes no sense and its the day before the month of September?!?! Terrible customer service!  Overall, I really enjoy the food and the atmosphere, It is such a cute place (only reason I'm giving 3 stars), but will definitely be trying other places as I just don't get that same feeling when I'm there, where I look forward to coming back again ;/",

The ambiance is enjoyable too, you can either have a group of friends hanging out together for HH, a casual date or even turn it into a romantic dinner; In this place you can set your own tone for the occasion.  The staff is friendly and tentative. The only recommendation to get the a 5 star rating is for the staff to highlight recommendations of the different wines and highlight any special selections/wine of the month along with possible pairings. However, if this is not a must for everyone, then a 5 star rating would be recommended, i personally appreciate the suggestions.",

After looking over what I would consider the 'Cliffs Notes' version of a wine list (BS on calling yourself a wine cellar), we chose a bottle of the ONEHOPE Red Cab. I was happy to learn that half the proceeds went to the cure for Autism until i realized that the waitstaff could have used the money, as they all had some special needs of their own.   In an attempt to move past the mediocre start to the evening we moved on to the food menu.    The Tomato/Basil/Mozzarella bruschetta had no basil (wtf?), the Orzo and Shrimp starter lacked the red onion it so desperately needed to be a success and who in their right mind serves their pizza on oversized crackers? Just because you throw something 'fancy' on the menu like duck confit doesn't mean you have a license to lack on quality.   Thankfully the music became the highlight of the evening. If it weren't for the 2-man, live band playing a lively rendition of MyGirl in the corner, I don't know if we would have survived the evening ;)",

This mom and pop establishment has a great outdoor seating area with a view of a neighborhood golf course.  We saw one patron bring in a small dog that was very well behaved.  She had a laptop so I assume that there might have been wifi available?  The server was attentive without being intrusive and the manager was very ingratiating as she visited each table.  They want to ensure that everyone enjoys the experience.  There was a TV but it was not in use.  For a sports fan it is not like a sports bar.  We were there for the happy hour but per their website they offer live entertainment.  Parking was easy for us since we were early. If you arrive late it might be more of a challenge; however, there is nearby parking for a short walk.  There is ample handicapped parking.  Groups larger than 4 or 5 may be in for a wait if it is busy.  The facility is small but well worth the visit.  Per their sign they open at 12:00 on Saturdays.  The Happy Hour ends at 6:00 Monday through Saturday.",

    "text": "Our friends invited us to join them at My Wine Cellar for their Wine Club's monthly wine club event.   To join the club you commit to a six month membership at $35/mo for 2 bottles of wine of their choosing or $55 for 3 bottles per month.  If you attend the wine tasting you have to pay an additional $15 for that.   If you're not a member the wine tasting costs $20 per person to taste 3 wines and eat some appetizers that are paired with the food.  We thought we'd sit in on this session and decide to join after the experience.  We were not impressed and we did not join.  This is why:  At each wine club event, three wines are showcased, two reds and a white.  Their wine expert stands on a little stool and yells out a story about each wine, it's origin, etc.  I had difficulty hearing what she said.  Then the servers come out and give you a piece of food to go with the first tasting. We got 2 oz of white wine and one shrimp wrapped in prosciutto.  The second tasting of red was paired with one piece of flatbread with chorizo (2x2 square) and the final tasting of red was served with a ice cream the size of a melon ball.  All that for $20.   We decided to order an appetizer and a bottle of wine (not sure why we did this).  We got a nice red and quesadillas.  The latter came out warm with a blob of melted orange plastic in between two limp tortillas.   There was about 2 oz of steak. Bland, no flavor at all.  The only thing good about it was the lime infused sour cream.    Our final bill for the \"wine tasting\", appetizer and bottle of wine plus tip?  $90!!!   We could have had a nice meal almost anywhere for that.  The owner was very brash--joking let's get them drunk so they will sign up for the club.  She asked us a few times if we were going to join.    I don't recommend joining this club and I don't recommend that you go there.  The food is okay.  There are other wine bars that do this better such as The Living Room.",

I had the creamy shrimp pasta and it was good, but for the price the portion should have been bigger. The hubby had the burger and it looked delish! He asked them to substitute jalapenos for the bourbon mushrooms and the were happy to accommodate. The salmon patties were very good and decent sized. We also ordered a meat and cheese board for am appetizer. We had the prosciutto and the lamb jerky and both were excellent, but again the portion sizes could be bigger. They had a live jazz band playing (it was saturday night) and it was nice, not to loud. We were there on a very rainy night and even still the place was busy. Very friendly service....I can see why this place has been around for so long!",

We usually make it a date night and go on Friday nights because we like the live acoustic music. It's not too loud to still have a conversation, even if you're sitting close to the talent. I love the atmosphere - when it's cooler, it's nice to sit around the fireplace and cozy up!   We seem to always get the same waitress when we go, but she's fabulous! She is very knowledgable and always makes great recommendations.   My husband loves good beer, and they have a really impressive beer selection, too.  The food's great, too. It is a little on the expensive side, but we typically just do a couple apps to share.   Overall, it's a great little gem and I would have never found it had it not been for Yelp!",

    "text": "I have been twice. Both times were great, the staff makes the place a charm to attend and go to.  ~Fud/Drink~ Well, the food takes an obvious second place to the wines in house, which there are plenty of. The staff understands how to interpret your pallet well, and easily helped guide my fiance and self through the options we had. We ordered some Sweet Red they had on the shelf which was perfect with the pizza we ordered. The pizza was a fine thin crust with yummy add-ins like pepperoni and olives, etc. The wines here all are fantastic, we had a hard time choosing from the selection they keep stock of. They also have some beers if you prefer that, although I believe the selection has changed.   ~Atmosphere~  It has a quiet, local and relaxing quality to it. I felt right at home and our waitress on each occasion was welcoming and attentive. It has a lot of homey qualities to the site, the bar area has a TV but its not in your face, allowing me the chance to pay attention to whom I am with, rather than other disturbances. They have an outdoor patio we briefly skimmed over. Next time I go I'll update on it so you have a feel for what it provides, etc. There is a general sense that loud noise is well out of the norm here, so boisterous parties are probably best left for reserving space for an event.   ~Extras/Rating~ They do host events, and they do a great job at hosting them from what I have heard. It is an awesome idea for a date, there isn't a better idea for a first date then some wine and pizza to chill to while you talk. They get 4 stars for having a good blend of food and wine/beer selection as well. Plus on top of that, the ambiance is perfectly romantic and will leave you with a great lasting memory! My fiance and I have a favorite wine bar, BUT this is a very close second!",

    "text": "Date night, wanted to try a new place. Called to see if getting a table at 8 pm on Sat night would be a problem, she said no, come on down. We wanted to love it, as it's not far from home. It hurts me to give a place with a new owner a mediocre review. But I have to be honest.  Happy that we caught Notes from Neptune playing music which is only once a month; they were REALLY good. Relaxing yet upbeat, nice sax & voices, & not too loud to hold a conversation; well-done choice of entertainment.  The blonde server helped me choose a wine, let me try one I was considering, which I appreciated.   My husband got beef sliders. They were tasty & toasted buns were a nice touch. They came with a few (a FEW) fries that seemed to be made from delicious, creamy potatoes, but were sadly soggy even though they looked pretty well-done.   I ordered two apps instead of a meal - the sweet potato chips (server said they are delicious, made fresh to order) and the brussel sprouts.   We did have a staggered order, as I took a while to decide on my food. Slider order went in first. But once I did order, I waited a LONG time for the chips, much longer than the turnaround for my husband's sliders. The menu says \"hand cut,\" so maybe they actually grab a raw potato and start carefully slicing when the order makes it into the kitchen?  However, I would then expect them to be uh-oh hot. When they arrived, they had NO heat at all. Given my history as a server & restaurant manager, I'm guessing then they were left in the window a while before making it to our table.  The sweet potato chips were a shockingly small portion for the $5 price - I had to hide my surprise when they were delivered. You gotta know, we are NOT \"big portion\" people, we often split an entree when we go out, as we are not fans of the \"more is better\" concept.  But for $5, this was ridiculous, a HANDFUL. My husband sincerely said to me, \"I planned to have a few, but I'd feel guilty, as you won't have enough.\" I should have counted, could have very easily and quickly, but didn't think about it before I dove in since I was hungry. They are thin-cut, come in a cutesy little mini-deep fryer basket lined very loosely with waxy paper that therefore holds them up higher than the bottom of the basket (like the gift basket trick of putting in a False bottom to lift up the gift items). Therefore, initially they look mounding out of the little basket, with a honey dip ramekin nestled in there with them (taking up yet more space NOT full of chips). Once I removed the ramekin and looked inside, I could no longer deny that yes in fact this was a - forgive me, owner - rip off. I know what a sweet potato costs, even an organic one bought at retail price at \"Whole Paycheck\" grocery store. I'm all for places making a nice profit, but honestly... I felt kinda \"taken\" by that app. If it had been delicious, maybe if it had \"wowed\" me (I LOVE sweet potato anything), but they were un-warm, not much flavor, and the honey aioli didn't improve them for me at all (I set that to the side after two tries).   The brussel sprouts for some reason took another 15 - 20 minutes PAST the chips to arrive (no exaggeration, the band took their entire break & went back to playing while we waited for the brussels). But when they finally arrived, YUM! we agreed we should have skipped the chips AND the sliders, and just had multiple order of the brussels. (But that would be weird, \"Hi, just 2 orders of brussel sprouts, please,\" - not a reason to return). They were delivered hot, and their weight pushed that little piece of wax paper all the way down into the cutesy basket, no space-robbing ramekin, so I'm happy to say said basket was joyously full. We didn't mind paying $6 for those!  (Surely the brussel sprouts cost more than a small sweet potato?? Don't understand pricing logic here).  Music really saved the whole experience from being really mediocre. Server was very nice, but either she screwed up my order and 1. left my first item in the window and 2. forgot to put in my second item for a long time, OR this is normal kitchen flow (she didn't say anything like, \"sorry for the wait,\" so maybe this is normal?). Either way, unimpressed.   SUMMARY: We agreed nothing to bring us back. However, we could see it's potential. If you hit it for happy hour prices and the music is good, and maybe when the patio is open, and the kitchen and servers are humming along, it could be a fine place to go, as others describe.  Moving on...........  P.S. - Funny, I just saw that \"Phyllis\" mentioned an odor the same night we were there. We were not sitting near either bathroom. I asked my husband at one point, \"Did you fart?\" He looked shocked, swore no (and he's pretty trustworthy on that Q.) A little while later I smelled a waft again... and I realized it was the same sewage smell that happens in public bathroom drains from time to time.",

    "text": "I was searching Yelp for bars with live music on a Friday night and My Wine Cellar came up with having a DJ who spins acid jazz.  It was date night, so I figured why not.  We arrived and the place was fairly busy, but not packed.  We were immediately greeted by all three members of the front-of-house staff. We were able to get a table against the wall in a booth-combo setup.  Katie, the bar manager, arrived promptly and said that we made it for happy hour and explained all the HH specials. The deals are good, especially if you want to explore some new wine tastes at a reasonable by the glass price.  Anyway, she asked us what brought us in and I explained the Yelp search.  She then told us that the DJ wasn't playing but a new young guitar player was going to be doing acoustic blues.  We were totally down with that.  We ordered two beers and a bruschetta combo.  The bruschetta was very unique, on good artisan bread, and topped with well created toppings.  We ordered the Caprese with tomato, basil, and fresh mozzarella; the Spanish, with mozzarella and thinly sliced chorizo with red peppers, and the brie and caramelized red onion.  It was a nice selection, and at only $11 was more than enough food to start our evening.  We took advantage of the happy hour food specials by ordering the tempura green beans with spicy aioli on the side.  The tempura was crisp, but left a little too much grease.  The flavor was really good and the aioli was a good accompaniment.   We were content.  As the end of happy hour approached, we decided to order two glasses of wine and were given direction by Katie, who is also My Wine Cellar's sommelier.  She did a great job of listening to our likes and matched two wines to our flavor profiles perfectly.  My wife had the Redwood Pinot Noir and I had the Crucillon Garnacha, a Spanish Zinfandel.  The music started and it was pleasant, although we were very close to the artist, so we decided to move to the bar.  It was also a little warm back in the corner and the bar was much cooler.  At the bar, we ordered two flatbreads, my wife opting to revisit the brie and caramelized red onion (she loved it), and me choosing the house specialty, The Territorial, a bbq-styled treat with short rib meat and provolone.  It was excellent.  Our evening at My Wine Cellar was thoroughly enjoyable, with each member of the staff conscientiously attending to every detail, engaging in pleasant conversation, and understanding how to take care of their customers.  We will surely return and look forward to sampling some other wonderful tapas and small plates, although I may not be able to get my wife to stray from her beloved brie and caramelized red onion now.",

This place has an awesome vibe to it, great food and wine, and good service.  The pizza is very tasty and filling. The bruschetta options are all amazing. I also tried the antipasto plate and was happy to see it came with a little salad that helped to balance out the saltiness of the meats. The cheese and olives that it came with were a great accompaniment to the wine we were drinking that night.   This place is awesome because their bottle prices are extremely reasonable in price and they have some diverse options. The comfy couches and relaxed atmosphere make it a great place to just hang out with friends for hours.  The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable and they are great at recommending new wines.  I asked about a wine that I had once but haven't been able to find anywhere else and they actually ordered a case of it for me!  Just a really great place.",

    "text": "After enjoying happy hour a couple years ago, I finally had a chance to eat at My Wine Cellar a couple weeks ago and had a wonderful time!  We were greeted by the staff immediately, and were offered a seat on the patio as there was live music.  The musician was fantastic and added the perfect ambiance for a nice dinner.  Our waitress was Sharon, and she had good knowledge of the menu suggesting a great red wine for myself and a beer for my boyfriend.  We decided to order a cheese plate, and I have to admit this was the one thing we were disappointed by.  The cheese was good, however it was a small portion.  The prosciutto was a bit too sweet and neither of us chose to finish the portion we were served.  Onto the entrees...we decided to go with the flat breads and share so we could sample two.  The boy chose the classic, no mushroom.  It was very flavorful and generous on the toppings.  The second was absolutely delicious!  I went with the Bacon and Squash and was impressed by the richness of the toppings without being overpowering.  Definitely a must try!  Next time we will probably go with the bruschetta to start, as we saw a few being served and they looked tasty.  Our waitress suggested dessert, however the meal was filling and we did not save room.  Overall the experience was wonderful for a date night!  The live music was not overpowering, and there was even a large birthday party going on that did not take over our experience.   The restaurant itself was nice, very open and accommodating for happy hour, however the patio really hit home for us and I am glad we sat outside.  4.5 stars for food and drink, bumped up a notch for the live music.    Definitely a must try if you like personal attention from the wait staff, good wine, and a beautiful patio to enjoy your meal on.",

I was one of those people until a co-worker of mine suggested it, been coming here ever since! I'm a fan of this place for happy hour (3-6pm)! They have a nice selection of wines and craft beers and their happy hour pricing is pretty good as well! The owner and wait staff are very friendly and talkative! They are always giving great suggestions on wines and beers to try. If you have a work event and want to do something a little different, this is a great place to try! I had a small work function last fall and it was a hit! They will set up food parings and wine or beer options specifically for your event. They can accommodate decent sized groups and when it's cooler out you can enjoy their patio that faces the golf course.  I recommend the meat and cheese plates or their crab dip for an appetizer and their flat bread pizzas are really good as well! They also have quarterly wine or beer paring dinner events! They usually bring in local breweries to pair their food with. Very cool idea if you are looking for a unique dining experience!",

There can't be more than 5 ladies on their waitstaff who are extremely friendly and knowledgeable about all the wines in house. Some nights they have live music on the back patio which is an added bonus to the great weather we have (almost) all year round.  If you stop in, make sure to try their meatballs... they are simply AMAZING!! Everything else is delicious too, but the meatballs are most definitely one of a kind and I love me some meatballs.

The service continued to be unfriendly. The doors were open and it was very warm and flys began to swarm. Still happy and being tolerant. Then the food began to come. The scones and presentation were beautiful but the lemon curd was like thick gelatin. Still okay enjoying my family. The next course was the sandwiches. They were basically grocery store sandwich meat on cheap white bread. Two of us ordered the tea and on top of the sandwiches were three old tarts and one eclair. Nothing was fresh and there were not even two of each. The mimosa orange juice was from a concentrate. The cost was $55 and it was worth at the most $10. Totally we spent $160.00 for a school cafeteria lunch. I want a refund so that my kids and I can try to have a real Mother's Day celebration.   Oh-the live music was fantastic. He was so good and we tipped him well.",

Very welcoming and unpretentious atmosphere and the wait staff is friendly and efficient.  The food...forget about it!!   Absolutely awesome and reasonably priced (catch Happy Hour and food prices are even better).   I can't say enough about the uniqueness and quality of the food.  Check out the menu before you go.  It is not full-course meals but an array of unique \"small plate\" salads, meats, cheeses and awesome, unique dishes. You'll want to share because you won't want to miss tasting everything.    I was lucky enough to be there when the weather was perfect (typical October weather in Phoenix) and spent time on the patio.  Great spot.  Live music, view of the golf course, plenty of umbrellas for shade during the day and a fire pit in the evening! I had mixed emotions about writing this review.  I don't want too many people to find out how great this place is because I don't want it to get over crowded...yet I want them to continue to be successful because it's such a great spot to eat and drink.  I could tell there were a lot of \"regulars\" there and they were a friendly, welcoming crowd.  Try this place out...bet you become a \"regular\".     Oh yeah, don't forget to say hi to the new owner Shannon.  She's always wandering around making sure everyone is happy and she also welcomed ideas to expand and improve the menu - she's obviously a Foodie. If you don't check this place out you're nuts.",

All original music, great style and feel, and he knows how to control volume and tone so damn well.  Certainly the best musician I have heard in an Arizona bar/restaurant after living here for 15 years.    I will certainly be back to experience an evening without the party.
