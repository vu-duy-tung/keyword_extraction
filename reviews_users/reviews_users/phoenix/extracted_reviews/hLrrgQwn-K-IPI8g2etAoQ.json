They recommended some crispy french toast that were topped with corn flakes to add crunch and yes  they were pretty crispy, they were deep fried like 'churros'!  Service is ordinary.",

I came here after a long weekend of enjoying a Phoenix Yelp Singles event at Wild Knight. After that night of open bar I was feeling pretty drained however my friend was like hey let's cure that hangover with a drink and this was the place he picked.  It was a great and lively place, there was a line, so I knew it had to be great. We were seated outside where you can watch the cars drive by and enjoy the scenery of Scottsdale. There were lots nice cars parked out too like an Audi R8! Alright moving on to the food, I got a simple, 2 eggs, hashbrown, bacon with fresh fruits. Surprisingly it was pretty feeling and fresh. Everything was cooked fresh and didn't have that old oil/grill taste. The fruit looked colorful and fresh as well. Along with that I had a whole french press coffee to myself and that too was amazing. I don't really see much places serving French Press Coffee nowadays. I usually just make it myself at home! It was a great place to just talk, relax, and bring my weekend to an end. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend. Give it a try, it's a great Sunday morning Breakfast/Drink location!",

It's the middle of summer in the desert and like fools we agreed to sit on the patio as it was packed and hoping it wouldn't be miserable.. Given that I am almost 7 months pregnant we had to be asked to move inside mid-way! The hostess handled our situation with a pleasant grace and our original server was very sweet about the change.  When our food arrived they forgot my husbands toast and then he realized that his omelette was not the one he ordered.  So I are without him and then waited for him to eat once his correct omelette came. He also had ordered hash browns but got country potatoes. Both of our egg dishes needed seasoning.. All in all it was pretty bland breakfast.  I highly doubt we will ever return!",

Our order came out in a decent amount of time but my biscuits and gravy as well as the accompanying scrambled eggs came out cold.  No check in from the waitress to see how the food was until I had picked my way through 1/3 of the cold dish.  I pointed out what had happened and received no apology, just a whole lot of \"and I care why?\" attitude.  She retreated into the back room and returned with a zero bill for my breakfast.  That's nice, but still, no apology.  I could continue to ramble on about the remainder of the bad service we received but I'll spare you from having to read it all.  This place is on our \"do not return\" list.",

    "text": "We honestly can't review the food, as having waited for over an hour  and fifteen minutes without recieving  anything other than a \"sorry, ten minutes we promise\" (three separate times), we had to leave to catch our 12'clock appointment. I know breakfast joints can get busy, particularly on a Sunday morning, but since we were sat at 10:15, we figured we'd have plenty of time. Even so, we thought we'd order something quick. I could even understand if we had ordered something super complicated or many courses...we ordered a smoothie bowl and a side of biscuits n' gravy. Like...its a smoothie, over some granola and fresh fruit, no cooking required. Biscuits shouldn't take all that long either (I'd assume as an available side for most breakfast plates you'd have them coming out of the oven regularly), and proper gravy can't be made quickly so it should be handy for breakfast service.  We weren't the only patrons having issues either, many of the other guests there were grumbling about the hour plus wait times. I understand it can be hectic on weekends, but you're a breakfast joint. You should thrive on the breakfast rush, god knows that's the only time you're open.  I wouldn't have posted the review if management had made any attempt to make it right.  Instead he came over and said \"don't worry about the bill, we hope you try us again\"  Don't worry about the bill? For the food we didn't receive? For the smoothie we waited for, for over an hour and never got? Damn right we're not worrying about the bill. And for the record, next breakfast in scottsdale we're trying someplace else.  Dude, get your kitchen in shape. There are so many excellent breakfast joints in old town, if you can't get food to your guests then you're not going to be one of them.",

Our server didn't come back in a timely fashion after dropping the glass on the table and so thankfully a busser overheard me mention to my friend that I was grossed out by it. He retrieved me a new one. We were charged for the dirty one too though. None of our food came out at the same time and one of my friends was left sitting there with no food after we all had ours. When eating his food after it finally came out, he found half of an EGGSHELL in it. Another friend of mine took the plate directly to the manager to make him aware of what had happened and the manager took the plate to the back. He returned a few mins later with the same plate with the eggshell just taken off (we know because my friend had eaten some watermelon prior to turning the plate in and that was still on the plate). The manager simply made a comment about how it was organic - no apology or compensation was offered. We weren't given silverware promptly with our food either. The overall experience won't have me returning any time soon.",

The wait was only about 15 mins, and we got to sit on the open air patio in the beautiful AZ weather.  We actually got a table quicker by asking for a table outside. We started off with a classic bloody, and it was good. We also got an iced mango chai tea which was the winner of the day. Briana was really good, but the food took a long while to come out (not her fault). The presentation of the dishes was completely lacking. One soup of the day (clam chowder) and half BLT, and it tasted okay. The Crab Bennie was also ordered with country potatoes and it was also just okay. Nothing spectacular here. However, the biscuits and gravy were awful. There is a distinct taste to them, that may be for some,  but we could not even eat one half of a biscuit (and we LOVE biscuits and gravy). Briana was nice enough to take it off the bill for us. Overall, not worth the 40 dollars plus tip to eat breakfast for 2... Would consider ordering some different dishes, as we unfortunately struck out on all 3. Would also say, the atmosphere is great for brunch drinks!",

If you're a breakfast place and can't come up with a recipe for whole wheat pancakes that taste decent, then DON'T put it on the menu and don't serve it.  I could understand a whole wheat pancake being a little grainy and maybe a little thick, but it certainly does not have to taste sour! Don't bother going. You'll be much better off at Orange Table near the Scottsdale Performing Arts Center, Daily Dose, or plenty of the other restaurants in Old Town that serve brunch.",

    "text": "Food was ok here. The first round of food I got was really cold, literally cold. First time I have ever sent something back to get the same thing again. It kind of scares me getting food after complaining, but they have an open kitchen. So I really felt ok with doing it this time. The next plate of food was good and hot.  Service is good to average. I sat at the bar with my friend, noticed only female servers and bartenders at the place. It is full of dudes gawking at all of them while ordering breakfast... Almost  creepy. You can tell all the girls here are so used to it they just have these fake smiles and tiring looks on there faces. Anyway they did have baileys and coffee, outside seating, wheat toast.... Which for some reason is rare here in old town Scottsdale. Atmosphere was really nice and modern. They need to work on the food being cold situation, I guess you can't really do anything about all the creeps:) might not come back unless someone else wants to go",

    "text": "I went here with friends for lunch since we work nearby. It wasn't awesome. It's trendy inside, and the waitresses all wear athletic attire, and everything is neon colored, blah blah. Typical Scottsdale trendy stuff. I got the turkey club, which was disgusting. There was ham on it, which it didn't state on the menu, and the ham eventually had to be taken off because it tasted like either over salted balogna, or Spam. The fries were cold, stuff and flavorless. I got a side of ranch to dip my bland cold fries in, and it was so salty I asked the waitress what was wrong with it. She brought me a new side, but it was the same. Salty as all get out. My friend had a breakfast plate she appeared to enjoy, with a side of biscuits and gravy. We tried a bite of the biscuits and gravy, but they were awful. The gravy also tasted like it had Spam or bologna or something in it, and was otherwise without flavor. It has the weirdest aftertaste. There were three of us at the table who love biscuits and gravy, but nobody wanted them. Maybe this place is better at doing breakfast, I don't know, but for the expensive lunch I had, I was very disappointed with the taste and quality of the food, and also the typical Scottsdale attitude of the waitress. Save your nearly twenty bucks and go to Rehab Burger Therapy - or anywhere else but here.",

The menu had a variety of amazing choices and it took all five of us a while to make a decision. Sadly, I made the wrong decision. I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes thinking they would have the chocolate chips stirred into the batter and evenly distributed throughout the entire fluffy pancake. I was wrong. My extra $1.50 for the chocolate chips only got me a 10-12 clump of chips smack dab in the middle of the giant pancake. That means most bites were just plain, boring, dry pancake. It was very sad for a chocolate chip pancake lover like myself. My sister said her build your own sandwich was delicious and my bacon was cooked to perfection. However, the entire menu was a little over priced. Most of us stuck to water because the juice prices were outrageous.",

    "text": "So happy to see this place has very average reviews.  I went today and did not enjoy one thing.  I hate when I come home to review a place tho, and see that everyone else liked it.  Then I have to wonder, is it me?  Am I too particular?  Anyway, judging by many other reviews, it is not just me.  I ordered a very basic bacon and eggs with white toast.  My friend ordered a plain waffle.  Waffle was cold.  Twice.  Butter didn't even melt on it.  There was one tiny dish of syrup, that barely covered half the waffle.  My bacon was undercooked, sunnyside up eggs were broken and the toast was whole wheat, when I ordered white.  And they only serve one slice.  Who doesn't serve 2 slices of toast with breakfast?  Wait, this gets comical.  So I asked her for white toast.  No problem.  She brings back white toast.  Then I see it's not buttered.  I then asked for buttered white toast.  Then she says I'll bring you some butter, as we only serve dry toast here.  If that's the case, then shouldn't they say something in advance?  Not everyone eats dry toast.  I said then the toast will be cold, socan you please make me fresh, hot toast and butter it in the kitchen?  She said they only have a butter oil liquid mix, so I'd probably not want that, but that she would bring me hot toast with butter on the side.  I said fine.  That order comes burnt with rock hard butter on the side.  I said can I please have white toast that is not burnt with butter that isn't hard like a rock, so I could spread it.  She said sure, she will try again.  So I get white toast, at last, not burnt, not buttered, but now with melted butter on the side.  Really.  A dish of totally melted butter.   Anyway, needless to say it took 4 times to get the toast order correct, and even then, it was served with liquid butter.  Pathetic.  If you can't fry an egg and not break it, and you can't serve hot, buttered toast, how can you claim to be a breakfast restaurant?  And who ever said this place is reasonable must come from New York or Paris, because I found them overpriced.  $2.75 for a cup of coffee.  $8 for a smoothie.  $12 for most egg dishes.  This might have become the norm at these overrated, trendy restaurants, but it's definitely not reasonable in my world.  BUT, even at half the price, I would not return.",

That is the only thing I've had there, so I can't comment on any of the other food, but when I've been with friends, they have always been happy with their food as well.  Unfortunately, I don't make it there very often because it's always so crowded on weekends--a testament to how good it is.  I have been a couple of weekday mornings, though, and my complaint was the same each time-- initially poor service.  Both times, I was seated and then waited at least 10 minutes for a server to come to the table.  I must point out that this was not during high-traffic times, so they couldn't even use being busy as an excuse.  The last time, my boyfriend actually went to the bar to get waters after we'd been sitting for so long, and it was only then that a server noticed and came to our table.  The good news is that, for the rest of the meal, she was pretty attentive.",

Need less to say I ordered a berry smoothie as well which was delicious! When our server aisha came back she was rude (i think she overheard us making fun of the fact she didnt know that a restaurant would have bottle water )and when one of my guests ordered a drink she told her know because she reaked of alcohol.... funny thing is non of us had drank yet and had all showered so she said I cant serve you its my judgement call... we asked to speak to the manager who everyone knows is going to back up the server .... after I informed the manager that none of us had drank and she was mistaken she had the nerve to tell me I reaked of alcohol as well.... best part is I dont drink and was the designated driver.... this place got a 2 for the smoothie being great it also gets me informing the world that their uneducated staff and mcdonalds bound management should be replaced and maybe they would be as busy as surounding establishments ... now at the breakfest club and so far its a five star time here",

    "text": "I go to Morning Squeeze periodically and thought I should write a review. I have been there perhaps 5 times in total. Ideally located on a visible corner off Scottsdale Rd in Old Town, the Morning Squeeze is fairly popular. It seems to appeal to a hip good looking crowd that was probably out the night before in Old Town. Not sure where I fit in that description! Nice interior design and vibe. Feels like a breakfast place. The servers here like those at local competitor the Breakfast Club hires exclusively young attractive women (girls) in short shorts or skirts. The men are mostly relegated to the kitchen and bus boy services. I like the food. The dishes are not IHOP. They are creative and tasty. Equal to but different than the Breakfast Club. One of my favorites is the Protein Pancakes. Not too sweet and very fulfilling. Fruit is fresh. Not all of the juices are fresh squeezed. If I would leave it at that I would give them a 4 star rating. My criticism of the Morning Squeeze is the service. While the girls are beautiful and some very nice, they are not on top of customer service. This is I believe the responsibility of the management to better train them. Many of the girls/women come off too snobby. While that is par for the course with pretty young women in social contexts, it is misplaced in a service context. This was the case 5 separate visits something not amiss by other guests. I hope they  sort this out. Overall I give the Morning Squeeze solid grades but due to the modest service quality not outstanding. I will re-review in the future and see if this has changed. I am rooting for the Morning Squeeze!",

The first time I went to the morning squeeze I got the breakfast sandwich with bacon on the side and it was delicious. Bacon was cooked perfectly and the sandwich was an amazing home style recipe. Unfortunately the second visit didn't live up to the hype.   On our second visit, the sandwich was just \"eh\" and the bacon was burnt to a crisp. Being a waitress, why would you even serve a plate of bacon that looks burnt and dry to a customer? I mentioned it to the waitress and she said \"ok I'll get you more.\" She came back with what appeared to be the SAME burnt and dry bacon. It was so hard it was literally inedible.   Hopefully they were just having an off day, or maybe they were training a new cook. (there was a kid who looked 16 in the kitchen)  Either way, if I give them a try again and have the same experience I won't be returning any more.",

No black beans in it lame. The cheese was not even melted on top, it was still cold, what the hell!? I put probably half the container of black pepper on it. We were never asked if we wanted anything besides water or how our food was.  It was insanely loud and hard to speak to others at table. When we were ready to leave, we had to flag down some random staff member and it took a while to get it paid. Ridiculous.

Server was quick, and took our drink order, came right back with water & coffee, next our food order, didn't take long.  The food was ok, nothing to write home about.  Server never came back to fill our coffees.   Sad, cuz I wanted another cup, and really never saw much of her.  So I had to get my Tabasco from another table.  Now I'm getting annoyed.     As I eat, I can see the girls behind the bar chatting it up & laughing.   Then I spot our server, Cami, she does not see me.   As I try to get her attention, I see her literally popping a zit on the bartenders shoulder, right in plain view of God & everyone!   I dropped my fork, told my friend, and we were done.  Cami finally shows with our bill, we take it to the cashier, and walk out.    BTW, I watched as Cami delivered food & coffee to other tables, she never went to wash her hands.

The smoothies were delicious and the perfect texture. I got a build your own breakfast sandwich which was spot on delicious and came with more sausage than I thought it would. One person got hash brown which are cooked in butter and perfectly seasoned. One other person got the veggie omelet which she said was superb. 10/10 would recommend and will be ordering from there again",

We ended up seating ourselves at the outside bar where pretty much all the chairs were open after the host told us there's no room anywhere and we have to wait 25 minutes to be seated. Everyone's food was disgusting. Nothing had flavor but was just covered in pepper. The bartender was rude and paid no attention to us and didn't check on us while she talked to every other person at the bar. Don't waste your money here!",

It's close to home, it's hip, has a decent menu..... but none of that makes up for the fact that I have never had good service here, my food has often times come out cold and is mediocre at best. My roommates and I were coming here on a pretty regular basis, but after our experience today with a server (if you could call her that) named Alexis, we will never come back. I'm in the industry and this chick shouldn't even have a job, I've never had worse \"service\" in my life. The manager, Leslie, attempted to make up for it, and she was very nice but the way Alexis acted left such a sour taste in my mouth, and the food isn't good enough to make me come back. After she got spoken to by her manager, and we were leaving, she had the nerve to run out to the patio as we were walking out the door to \"thank us\" in the most petty way. We all tipped her, and honestly more than we should have, so there was no reason for her to act so inappropriately. If she focused on her tables as much as she did on being a b word, she'd probably be a little more successful at her job.",

The server came over and took our drink order quickly but that was about the only thing that was quick about the whole experience. We ordered an eggs Benedict with hash browns (extra crispy) and a black and bleu burger (medium rare) that was supposed to have caramelized onions, black peppercorn patty, and Cajun spices.  40 minutes went by and there was still no food. When the food finally arrived, the eggs Benedict was actually cold to the touch and rubbery, the hash browns were close to undercooked and very far from \"extra crispy\", and you can tell the entire plate had been sitting there waiting for a solid 15 minutes at least. The burger was warm but was completely gray on the inside, totally missing the caramelized onions, no black peppercorn, and whatever \"Cajun spices\" that were supposed to be on there seemed to be just salt. Burger was overall way too greasy as well and that's a shame because you could tell it started as quality ground beef, I could've make something better on my own grill and that's pretty sad. Fries were also cold to the touch and generally unimpressive.  If .5 stars was an option I would've chosen that, but I guess the only positive part of the experience is that the server was at least nice. I won't ever be back.",

One employee did a check-back without eye contact, and walked away before I could utter a word about the item. The check was automatically dropped, as if they were trying to avoid any further interaction. We would have at least ordered more drinks, but instead left feeling unwanted.",

I had the VW Squeeze - egg, avocado, sliced turkey and havarti cheese piled on a delicious pretzel bun, a side of fresh fruit and a choice of potato. The hash browns were underwhelming. My boyfriend got the breakfast potatoes and they were amazing. Next time I'd definitely get those. Also, the iced nectarine green tea is awesome. Straight up. :) I have to agree with some of the comments about the coffee being super bitter. Dad in law's girlfriend put seven sugars in it and the whole bit of cream and said she couldn't even taste the cream or sugar. Yikes!! Total bill for four people was $37 (before tip-Dad in Law and his girlfriend eat like birds) so not too bad! The little bar/patio was nice, a little chilly after they turned off the warmers, but there were a bunch of two-seaters and four-seaters so there was room. We went at a great time, though. As we were leaving there was a line waiting out the door. Good thing the weather was great :)",

I didn't know what to expect of the food, I went with the jet setter, asked for avocado and an over medium egg. It arrived and I honestly was disappointed. The portion size was legit but to use a full sized pretzel bun for a breakfast sandwich is a little much. We already are getting a carb only option as a side. Top of bun=removed. One could def. Enjoy the pretzel bun if about an inch was cut out of the middle. No avocado  and an over easy/runny egg but didn't want to wait. Mental errors will kill the experience for those who know steps of service. All in all, it was what I had expected I probably won't be back",

    "text": "I will start off with the positive.  This restaurant is in a very nice location.  I love the atmosphere.  They have seating on the outside where you can sit right off of Scottsdale Rd.  Good for people watching.  Me and my wife have been talking about coming here for breakfast for quite some time.  Today we got to eat there and I will have to say we enjoyed sitting outside and our waitress was very good.  Very attentive and did an excellent job of making sure we had everything we needed.  Kudos on the atmosphere and the service.  Now comes the bad part.  I think maybe our cook either was new on the job, and had lied on their resume, or they didn't really care about cooking food that morning.  They could have been hung over too.  At any rate my food was extremely sub par.  My over medium well eggs were extremely runny (I hate runny eggs).  My hash browns were potatoes not hash browns.  I was told they were out of hashbrowns after the fact,  and I guess the cook made a decision that I was getting potatoes whether I liked it or not. My sour dough toast reminded me of the fake food samples that you see in your dietitians office.  Dry and hard as a cracker.  Last but not least half way through my sausage patty I noticed a clump of an unknown substance on the second sausage pattie.  That was it for me!  It's sad that you can actually have a meal that  bad in a public restaurant.",

    "text": "STRIKE 3 and you're out.   Extremely disappointed with the service that was received at the bar today. Usually I would venture out elsewhere since we have had poor service numerous times here, but today I thought I'd give morning squeeze a 4th chance. . I am not one to usually complain, but the service at the bar was absolutely horrible today (and horrible is an understatement).   Being Saturday I figured there would be a wait - not a big deal as it's expected on weekends. We snagged two seats at the bar. Waited 15 minutes to order a drink, not a single gal behind the bar acknowledged us. No boggy again understand it's busy.   We proceed to put our food order in, figure it'd be a normal turn, 20 minutes or so to get your food. Hate to say this, but an hour later, no food, no acknowledgement and I had already asked once as it was pushing towards me being late for work. Kindly ask and the gal behind the bar states it's on its way out. Well 15 minutes later, nothing. No food. Not even an acknowledge me of a drink refill, nothing. Yet everyone around us, happily eating, food received to people who sat down after us.   Foods finally out, I'm running late to work and scarfing my food down that I thought I'd be able to enjoy with my girlfriend as I'm here visiting.   Does it really take 3 people behind the bar to make mimosas for one table?  Not to mention standing there talking with your coworkers seemed to be WAY more important than checking in on your customers late food order. Clearly she forgot to ring our food in, own up to it. It's busy I get it. Bill came, no discount no apology. Still tipped tho, as I know the service industry is based off tips.   Absolutely will not be returning to morning squeeze, period.",

I also recommended this place to my coworkers who stay at the hotel near by. First my tacos came out with no meat, I asked for corn tortillas so they came out again with meat and on flour tortillas. She brought my corn tortillas on the side so I could switch them myself. I know they rushed to get the corn tortillas out so they were cold and not heated up. Super disappointed and glad I paid to make my own breakfast. I didn't expect a discount but she didn't even ask how was everything was or ask me if I'd like something different. I picked apart the inside because I was starving. Glad to know they don't care about customer satisfaction.",

The ricotta was supposed to have lemon in it but that was lackluster and gritty, not smooth consistency. The lemon chutney was sloppily placed on 3 corners of the 4 sided plate. Presentation was clearly not cared for. And the chutney needed to be cut up/graded better during prep. I had to do additional cutting before being able to eat it.  I guess when it says lemon ricotta pancakes, I was expecting to not get a lump of it plopped on top of my pancakes and left for me to put the final plating together.

I am so delighted to report that the service was night and day! Hats off to the manager Leslie for being on top of her kitchen - she is a class act and a big reason the restaurant seems to now be thriving. The food came out way faster than expected, and the taste was on point. I also gave their peach pear smoothie a try and definitely recommend it for a nice, light refreshing treat. Thank you Morning Squeeze! I will definitely be coming back again.    Truly wish I could give them a higher rating, but the kitchen needs to get its act together. The first time I came the service was decent; today it was not. Seems like it's hit or miss. Waited for more than an hour to get food, and had to start snacking on whatever I had in my purse. The server felt so bad she even brought a comp side dish while I waited. By the time the entree arrived I was full and everything was just backwards. While I did come in during a busy day, this length of a delay is inexcusable. If you're willing to wait a long time to get your food, I recommend. If not, go elsewhere. Disappointing, as I really enjoy the ambiance.",

I really enjoyed the pleasant atmosphere with the restaurant open to the street. Our server was very friendly and attentive to everything. I had The Belfer Fit Bowl with shredded pork and avocado. My husband had the Breakfast Tacos. Both entrees were delicious and filling!!! We will definitely eat at Morning Squeeze again next time we're in town and will probably order the same thing because it was so good. I highly recommend Morning Squeeze!!!!",

We had visitors from Virginia and spoke very highly of our past experiences there to  our guest.   Unfortunately, we were very embarrassed by the service and how cold our entrees were when we finally received them at our table. I ordered their famous biscuits and gravy which came out cold 2 times. We still left a 20% gratuity in kindness but we're heavily considering not returning.",

The food was good, but I won't pay that much for an average meal again.  I felt I was gouged due to the spring training time of the year.  We did find better food at better restaurants in the area.   Again, the food was fine, just seemed over priced.",

The coffee was fresh and never had to ask for a refill. The breakfast burrito was very good and a good size to share. It came with potatoes which were cold and we asked for hotter ones but when they came those weren't much better. The pancakes were average and dry. The service was great!",

    "text": "Tried this place for the first time today. Waited for about 15 minutes, hostess was very friendly. Service in general was not that great.   I asked for eggs my way, with cheddar cheese and mushrooms and onions in my eggs. Husband had the fit bowl and we shared the oats and nuts waffle. I asked a few questions as we hadn't ate here, however the server did not know the answer, like what kind of nuts were in the waffle. Not a huge deal but the server did not offer to find out, which is not good service in my opinion.  Waited for about 30 minutes for our food. My dish came out without cheese and onions, missing butter and jam for the toast and no butter for the waffle. Waitress came to check on the food and I let her know I was missing the cheese and onions and butter and jam. She responded that it should be there, although it obviously wasnt. She came back with shredded cheese on top of my eggs, cold. I asked if it can be melted.  She came back again but they then added green peppers to my egg.   My husband asked for ketchup for the hasbrowns. Waited several minutes, no ketchup. I went to the host stand and asked for ketchup, another employee said sure, and then said she'll be right there. I go back to our table, wait a couple more minutes. Our waitress comes by, but just to clean the next table. Still no ketchup. Finally someone else brings it out.  I ask the waitress for our check and she picks up my silverware from my plate, of my uneaten waffle, and grips it by bottom end of the fork prongs. I explained that I hadn't ate the waffle yet, and could I have new silverware. She found this to be a weird request, but why would I eat with utensils picked up in her hand (the part that goes in my mouth) not the handle.   Overall the food was average. I did like the waffle, although it had cooled off significantly by the time I got to try it.",

After too many mornings to count where we were forced to send back a \"toasted English muffin\" because it arrived cold and raw - how is it I asked for a \"warmed\" blueberry muffin and I see it cut in half, toasted and burnt to a crisp? WTF?  What was once a new and interesting place to hang out and people watch has become a victim of their own success.  How many times can you express your disappointment and the only response is to \"comp\" the item. Today I was told - \"I understand why that seems bad\".  I understand too, it's because IT IS BAD! No longer will I not critique  the servers who arrive Saturday and Sunday morning hung over and huddled in the corner reviewing the events of the prior night while coffee cups sit empty and orders sit on the kitchen window getting cold.   When food product arrives with shards of melted plastic in it because someone dropped a spatulate on the grill \"by mistake\" and when this is all served up with a - we just don't care - attitude on the side.  Well, I do care and I am done and I hope all those other regulars and those reading this and looking for a new option do the same. Perhaps it is time to seek out a new option and new place, one actually worth it.",

    "text": "Ever wonder why some people NEVER LEARN? Well, I have to look in the mirror and wonder that myself. After my last experience here I'm wondering why I would go back, but I'm a sucker for a memory. I really love the feel of this place. I loved the experiences and food I've had prior to the last few visits but this may be the 3rd strike. I met my AOB buds here for lunch. And, as fate would have it our experience this time was much the same as the last. First, lets start out with a public service announcement to ALL servers who think it's cool to memorize the customers order in your head. IT'S NOT. No one cares if you can remember ANYTHING. That's not why the customer is at your place of employment. They are there to be served. All the customer wants is what they order. CORRECTLY. And when you don't write anything down and the order comes out wrong and then you blame the kitchen the ONLY person who looks like a schmuck is YOU. Do yourself a favor and all of your past and future customers, WRITE ORDERS DOWN.  So, here's how our lunch went. Our server was AM Bar. Yep, forgot her name which is a good thing for her. AM Bar is what it says on the receipt. Regardless, as I ranted above I'm sure it's obvious that she did not write our orders down. We even told her that it would probably be a good idea because our friend S (female) loves to order stuff and then make so many changes it's hardly recognizable as the original food she ordered. But, this server in ALL her wisdom thought she knew better and did NOT write anything down. T ordered the Cali Bennie ($10). He also ordered the Ham Steak Side ($3.95). His Cali Bennie was fine he said, but the Ham Steak never materialized. By the time he was asked how everything was and he pointed out the missing item, he decided that he didn't want it anyway and told our server to forget about it. S (male) ordered the Breakfast Burrito with Red Sauce ($9.75) His burrito came with green sauce and instead of waiting and having them re-fire another, he gave in and just ate the green sauce covered burrito. S said it was tasty but would have been better as ordered, not as delivered. S (female) ordered the Caesar salad ($7) with oil & vinegar instead of Caesar dressing. She also ordered the dressing on the side. She also ordered a side of Deviled Eggs ($3). A pretty good deal for 3 bones you get 3 halves. S commented that they were pretty good. And guess what? Her entire order was correct. I ordered the Build Your Own breakfast sandwich ($6.50). This really is an amazing deal, of course that only applies if they get it right. Which they didn't, AGAIN. And this is where I kind of insisted that she write down the order because there is a lot to remember. But alas, she thought she was being neat or cool or something. In the end, she was just an idiot. I ordered the sandwich with fried egg, chicken, Havarti cheese on wheat bread and added Avocado, Tomato and Onion. My sandwich came with no chicken. No meat of any kind. Seriously? Our server was kind enough to bring me a side of chicken, which ended up being a grilled chicken breast, but I wanted the chicken on the sandwich, not a side plate. Plus, the chicken was DRY. The sandwich itself without the chicken was ok and was half gone by the time the chicken did arrive. I will note that the restaurant took my sandwich off the bill. BAD service, 3 out of 4 mistakes, adequate food, good prices. 1.5 Stars.",

Yes, it's super cute decor and trendy looking waitstaff, dog friendly patio and fresh and healthy options are all great- I just can't return after the multiple times of sorely lacking and unprofessional service we have encountered. I can take a lot of abuse as a patron and not complain. Yes I will scrape off the cheese I didn't ask for or overlook a slightly burned pancake but today we politely sat for over 30 minutes while 2 parties that order after us received their food. After 5 more minutes we informed our server- and she corrected us first, claiming we ordered after them, then checked her station and realized we were right. Even after going back to the kitchen we waited about another 10 minutes. When we received our food my partner's chicken was so burnt he could not even cut it with a knife. We begrudgingly sent it back as we were starving - we waited over 10 minutes for a replacement and the manager was informed but never stopped by to check on us.  Unfortunately this was the second time I had to send something back here (and only the 3rd time ever in my life!). On my previous visit my chicken sandwich was undercooked and the same manager did do the right thing and got it re made and back to me and came to check up and apologize. That is why I decided to return but unfortunately we were rewarded with being ignored by our server, given burnt chicken then having to wait an inordinate amount of time for a replacement and not getting a follow up with the manager.   Sorry guys but until you have some management changes we are threw.",

Bartender was nice and attentive enough but not overly friendly, which seemed to be the theme for the staff here. We had to tell our waitress a joke in order to get her to crack a smile. I get it... They hire pretty and it's appreciated, especially for breakfast. But the girls could smile a little.  I ordered the burrito, which came highly recommended but I couldn't understand why. It was bland and hard to tell the ingredients because they were so mashed together the inside looked like something I would feed my dog. I also didn't feel very good immediately following breakfast. It wasn't pleasant.  My buddy had an Denver omelet and said it was awesome. So maybe that's a better way to go.  The wait for food was a little longer than expected also.  Overall, I would t recommend it but I wouldn't write it off. Order the omelet, the burrito is overrated.",

    "text": "We visit Scottsdale several times a year and decided to stray from our routine of eating at Daily Dose and try this place on a recommendation we received. After looking at the pictures of the eggs benedict online we decided to give this place a shot. We went to the restaurant on Monday morning around 8:30 am. Service was meh, kind of slow, especially for not being busy. Took about 10 minutes from the time we put in an order for coffee for the waitress to come back and ask what we would like to order for breakfast. She was visibly standing chit chatting with another server. After we were done eating it took about 15-20 minutes to get the check.   We ordered 2 coffees, a build your own breakfast sandwich (English muffin, cheese, fried egg, sausage, and American cheese), and pulled pork benedict.  The 2 coffees were fine, not the best tasting restaurant coffee. It became much worse when I got to the bottom of my coffee and ended up with a mouth full of coffee grinds because they had poured me the bottom of the pot. The build your own breakfast sandwich was good. The \"fruit cup\" that comes on the side can barely be classified as a fruit cup. It should be called a fruit garnish. I received a couple measly pieces of cantaloupe and melon and count them, two slices, not pieces, but thin slices of strawberries and 4 blueberries. The amount of fruit in the cup didn't even cover the bottom of the bowl they serve them in. It'd look better to just put them on the side of the sammie, it doesn't need it's own serving dish. There's not enough in there to warrant it. Now for the worst part of the meal. The pulled pork benedict. I'm not really even sure why they would send the plate out the way they did, but the \"poached\" eggs were not poached. There weren't even egg whites to be seen on the plate, well there were...but they weren't cooked. The plate looked like egg soup, like someone forgot to cook the egg and just cracked two raw ones on top of the benedict. The entire plate was mush. After it took so long to even take our order and not really ever seeing our waitress again we ate the pork and the english muffin and pushed the slop to the side.  Would not go back to this restaurant; not when there are more consistent and dependable breakfast places within 2 blocks. 2 stars for the breakfast sammie and the orange juice which we ordered after the meal because \"there has to be some redeeming quality about this place right?\"",

In that 40 min time frame, the server only came by once to fill our water before coming back again to say our food would take longer. Eventually, the table next to us, who complained about the same issue, left before we decided to just walk out as well. From being sat to leaving it was around 50 mins for two basic breakfast orders before we left without having gotten anything but waters. Oh and the food, way overpriced.  I wish I could say it was worth the money but I didn't even get my food. But based on other reviews, I doubt it would be.  All that being said, if you want to just waste you life sitting around doing nothing, this is your spot.",

    "text": "I'm hemming an hawing between 2 and 3 stars ... The food is A-Ok.  The service could use some polishing!  I wish I could remember who served me this past Saturday, but she was seriously lacking with being prompt and attentive.  Took a few minutes before she hit our table after seating, and she apologized.  Then again when our food finally got to us via a food runner (again she apologized for the long wait...it was probably 20-25 mins), she didn't come back and check on us until we were ready for to-go boxes.  Such a shame because my avocado didn't come out with my breakfast burrito, and I really would have liked more of the green salsa (don't bother with the red... too much smoky chipotle and the flavor balance is off).  I also never got a refill on my water.  My friend and I were at a two top on the patio, and after the breakfast rush around 1130am... Why the lack of attention?? I will say the classic bloody mary was on point. Its what saved this from being a 2-star review.  Perfectly spicy and not at all bitter.  This is probably the only spot in town that doesn't run any drink specials for mimosas or bloodies on wknds.  Morning Squeeze has a large menu, and offers vegan/vegetarian options, which I appreciate.  They have a protein shake called The Jolt that I've had in the past with almond milk and highly recommend if you're looking for a morning boost!   Not sure I'll put this in regular or serious rotation for brunch/breakfast... It could be much better and much more appealing with a few tweaks and some better service training.",

I wish they would keep it clear so we can get our coffee without having to go around people   The food was delicious. I had the breakfast tacos with chorizo and I added the chili verde. This is a must try. The tacos were not skimpy! They were packed full with moist egg and chorizo and spicy and delicious pork in a tasty verde sauce. Add in the sour cream and pico de gallo that comes on the side and you're in for an amazing delicious breakfast!",

I had the Foxy Lox Down Scramble which had smoked salmon, capers, red onion, and tomatoes. I also had the County potatoes which had medium sized chunks of multi-colored bell peppers and onion. For drinks he had the mocha and I had the large Dirty Chai which was creamy and delicious. We sat on the dog-friendly patio which was the perfect temperature for a hoodie mid-December & thoroughly enjoyed people watching and the antics of the local birds. The decor is bright and cheery, yet the bathrooms are very dark and subdued which makes for quite the contrast! Thoroughly enjoyable experience which makes me wish that we lived closer!",

I had a breakfast meeting this morning and suggested we meet at Morning Squeeze since I hadn't been yet.  It was 8:30am on a Thursday am and there was a nice buzz going on when I walked in, but not too crowded. The hostess was welcoming and I like the colorful decor... Shortly after I met my colleague, we were greeted by our servers, who were just attentive enough.  Our drinks were delivered quickly, which I was thankful for too!  I went with their wheat pancakes and a side of egg whites and my friend had the oatmeal brulee.  My eggs were a bit on the salty side, but I dealt with it, and we both enjoyed our breakfast.  The pancake serving size was huge, so I even had leftovers to bring home!    The only awkward feedback was that my \"side of egg whites\" came on two extremely small plates instead of one medium sized one.  They also only had small to-go containers, which wasn't a big deal, but hopefully they'll order some medium sized plates and larger to-go containers in the future.  Other than that, I found prices to be moderate and service spot-on.  Parking wasn't an issue and the location is super convenient to my office and the heart of Old Town, which I love!  I look forward to returning soon.  I hear their lunch menu is pretty good too!",

Pros:  Waitress and hostess were both AMAZING. My husband and I have both been in customer service for awhile and tend to kinda people watch. The staff was consistently great with every table.  Mimosa was good for the price. $6. My husband had fresh squeezed OJ. So amazing!!!  Husband had the veggie omelette. Over cooked, but decent. He opted for all fruit, no potato, and the fruit consisted of watermelon, melon, and pineapple. Also not bad.  French toast was yummy!!!!! I added bacon and strawberries. Bacon was a bit undercooked, but not bad.   Cons: Like I said, I added strawberries to my French toast and for the extra $1.50, I expected more. They looked frozen (even though they're in season) and I think I got a total of 2. Kinda bummed.  The wait for food was pretty long and it didn't seem fresh for the wait, if that makes sense. It seemed like it had been sitting for a bit before it was brought out.   Overall, we might be back. We might check out our other options in Scottsdale next time, but overall it was pretty ok.",

I understand they wanted to skinny down the menu since they had so many items. They left off some of my favorites, peach blossom protein smoothie, Waldorf chicken salad, etc.   I tried to give the new menu a shot but the skinny down lunch had little to pick from and even on item that I finally did select they were out of (Waldorf sand which), fewer menu items should allot for them to always be available. I think got the steak sandwich, MISTAKE. It was covered in creamy blue cheese sauce and a ton of arugula. I knew the sand which came with it but it was over powering the steak and just sloppy. Also the fruit side was a joke. 4 pieces of fruit that were basically all Rhine.   Wasn't surprised that the place was no longer that busy at lunch as I won't be either.",

    "text": "I won't give up on this place......yet.  I really like going here because of the location, atmosphere and generally the staff but my most recent visit was disappointing.    It started with the hostess.  There were no people waiting in line or lingering around waiting for a table.  In fact, there were 2 empty tables.  When I requested a table for two, preferably outside on the west side of the bar area the hosted took my name and that was it.  10 minutes and still 2 empty tables later we still hadn't been seated.  Was there a waiting list?  I don't know since I was never told there would be a wait for a table.  In my 11+ years of working in restaurants I've never heard of NOT informing a patron that there is a wait to be seated.  With 4 empty seats at the bar my companion and I opted to sit there.  Both bartenders working the bar were very friendly and always kept our coffee and waters filled.  The food was okay.  I had the corned beef hash and I wasn't impressed, nor will I  every order it again.  The toast.  What is it with Morning Squeeze and their constant ability to screw up the toast?  Last time I ate here the toast was burnt, hard and cold.  You could also smell toast burning.  This time I ate here it was an exact, and I mean EXACT repeat.  Burnt, hard and cold toast on my plate and twice during our time there you could smell burning or burnt toast.  Obviously their system for making toast needs some serious improvement.  My companion had the Release Grayson and it was good.  As the place became busier and busier I watched numerous waitresses and one of the bartenders get clean glassware off the hanging racks by sticking their fingers INSIDE the glasses.  That is a major NO-NO!  You do not, I repeat do NOT put your fingers inside glassware or carry them from the top of the rim.  That is \"Restaurant 101\".  No, I am not being picky or a \"germophobe\" you just don't do that.  Think of 10 possible places those fingers could have been 30 seconds prior to being inside that clean glass.  Counting money?  Wiping their face?  Cleaning a table?  You get my drift.  I am hopeful my next visit is better and I will definitely specify to the server how I won't my toast prepared!",

(gotta try the morning jolt)  It's the place to be on the weekends for sure (be prepared for a wait) but perfect for doing business during the week or if your just passing through Old Town Scottsdale.  I highly recommend trying morning squeeze out.",

I was actually served cold coffee at one point in the meal and besides that the coffee really wasn't that good, fresh or strong. The stack of choc. chip pancakes was slighly overcooked and the pancakes were tough to cut after a few bites. They did include chips baked in, but not the chocolate syrup I saw on my IG account. Also, the first batch of breakfast tacos were cold and the following batch was good, but nothing like we can recall from 2015. This place seems to have fallen behind the big three of Scottsdale.",

Morning Squeeze usually has a wait line on the weekends but we decided to put our name in. We go there occasionally. The hostess said 25 to 30 minutes. As we were waiting inside I noticed many empty tables, 10 that I could see from where I was standing including booths! I asked the hostess if they took reservations so I would know for the future to call ahead. She said no. I said I wondered because there were so many empty tables. (Many people were waiting to be seated). She said she likes to stagger things. I have to say I was more than surprised. I used to work in the restaurant industry many years ago and I can't imagine leaving 10 empty table for the convenience of the restaurant while guests are waiting. For this small restaurant it was at least 1/3 of the tables maybe more. Even if they were short staffed there was more that one person at the hostess desk. I know when I was in the business the owner or manager would seat or take orders if necessary. It really made me feel like they did it on purpose to make the place look busier than it was by having a big line outside. Server was very nice, food was good. Managing flow, questioning motive/ one star.",

Then we see the same waitress that the food runner asked and she blurts out \"ITS COMING\" before we even got the chance to politely ask again. Then our waitress came and she put the check down with out saying anything. They acted as if we were doing THEM a favor by eating at their restaurant.

As such it fills a void in the market  I thought I was in for an expensive meal when I saw a Maybach and a Vette parked out front, but we're talking Denny's level prices for a meal with good portions, at a place that doesn't skimp on paying serious rent or multiple waitress' wages  I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of the Greek omelet in which I substituted egg whites. The feta and the grilled tomatoes were to die for, and the omelet was the perfect level of fluffiness without being soggy  Hash browns were too oily, but I could live with that  Overall a solid 8.5 out of ten on the food, and perfect ten for patio seating and ambiance. All for a reasonable price",

However, the first time my friends and I dined here, our inexperienced but gorgeous server forgot some parts of our order and never checked on us. It's really important to check back with the guest after food is dropped. My friends and I ofcourse came back and were able to enjoy our meal because we had everything we ordered, and the service was ofcourse awesome. I wish I could remember her name, because she was stellar!  We would continue to come in, but service was always inconsistent, and we didn't want to juggle with it...BUT things MUST be changing because... This morning, I called and ordered a bagel breakfast sandwich to go because our office is very close by and because they seemed so busy, I waited to pick it up, not to mentioned called 3x to place the order. I walked in and the very bubbly manager, Gino, was surprised I took so long to pick it up...He explained that the place was under new management- after he understood my frustration. Not only that, but they were shorthanded, and Gino was totally efficient. Today when I walked in, not only did he approach me right at the door - but the bartender was on top of it too- asking if I had placed a to go order! Im really happy about this because before, I'd walk in...stand around the hostess podium....while the staff stands by the server station and the only one who approached me was clueless about the order... .I know I seem harsh, but I too have been in the industry- and this place has so much potential! I've always been proud or priviledged to work at certain places, like Olive and Ivy and The keg etc. People dine out for the experience...Not just convienience. It's nice to go out and have a server that is full of energy, knows the menu, and cares about the guest. I think Gino will do great job...and when you go in, sit AT the BAR....The day time bartender is on top of her game!!! I would still give the servers a chance too:) The patio is dog friendly and the inside is comfortable...This review is mainly all compliment because today I was really impressed and even as short as the interaction was...it really showed that the new management cares:) Good job Squeezers...",

The menu is filled with an abundance of well put together items that are perfect for those trying to eat healthy. Eggs generally don't sit well with me, plus I'm diabetic, so I ordered a tuna salad. I was informed lunch items didn't get served till 11:00. It was 10:00. I explained my issues and asked if she would Ask if they could do this for me, which they were willing to do. I really appreciate a places willingness to put customers above what time it is. This was a large reason for my five stars. Another reason for 5 stars was the food itself. My salad was fresh, crisp, lightly dressed, and the tuna was also lightly dressed so you tasted tuna. So many times at other places I feel like asking if I could have some tuna with my mayo. But not here. There was a hint of Tarragon that was a pleasant surprise as well. My daughter had an egg white omelet with spinach and other healthy ingredients. It looked beautiful and she enjoyed it very much. She had to take half of it home. You really get plenty of food. We saw someone served a breakfast burrito that looked big enough for 3-4 people. Fresh squeezed OJ and good coffee makes this place worthy of my coming back and encouraging others to check this place out.",

Our waitress, Karissa, offered her favorites and we went with her suggestions:  breakfast tacos with sausage and the billy bob Bennie.  Tacos came out with link rather than pattie as ordered....karissa offered to exchange, no big deal.   The Bennie was good, but the the hash browns could have been warmer.  Coffee was hot and strong.  Not a solid 4 stars, but better than three...more attention to detail and this place can be the best breakfast spot in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "YES!  WAAAAY better and actually this place itself was better than it is now.  What happened?  Love the area-get to walk from our home into town and the view is Camelback mountain.  SO much going for this place and something is missing.  A breakfast place in town should be welcoming and homey so that even out of towners or snowbirds want to go back for more.  We get repeat visitors in Scottsdale so we need to develop joints that last for decades just like cities as New York, Chicago, LA...I have certain restaurants I go back to every time I visit even the smallest of towns... worst thing that happened that may be a cause is lack of accountability of what is expected from the employees.  A manager needs to get their employees to feel where they work is awesome and appreciate them then maybe they would worry about doing things that could cause them to leave their awesome job...for instance...we literally walk away from our table after eating and realize my husband left his very expensive NIKE sun glasses on the table so we walk back and they are gone...the bartender even noticed to tell him that he just saw him with them on his head.  My husband never went to bathroom neither.  My husband immediately asked the busboy and he said no.  Low and behold after looking everywhere and asking everyone I asked my waitress to please ask the kitchen again and how interesting the busboy had them.  It was to obvious and too weird.  Are you kidding me?  Is it worth losing a job let alone your integrity?  I mentioned this to the manager and her excuse was lame...ok...well, now you know why a business may lose its strength and it starts with PAPA BEAR and frankly this restaurant is missing a gut.  A good soul with some depth can survive, but the rest of them will eventually fade out.  I wish this restaurant much luck and hope it finds its way back.  I would start with good help.  Honest help that takes pride in working and is afraid to lose their job.",

Great EXCEPT they then hand me the ENTIRE BILL.  In no way did I expect they would pick up the bill $26, but I did think they would take my breakfast off the bill.  Super angry that he can tell me about how fanatical about he is about his clothes while allowing me to walk out with water spots (where I tried to get the food off) all over my shirt and shorts.  The people watching were amazed that it was the manager who did it and then did nothing but hand me his card.  I won't be back as long as John Gino  Giannini is the manager.",

    "text": "I was taken here by a friend who lives in Scottsdale. He said it was one of the best breakfast places in town. His claim for Morning Squeeze's greatness was supported by how busy the place was and the amount of people waiting for a table. Unfortunately, Morning Squeeze did not come close to what I expected.  Our group of four was put on the waiting list with a estimated wait time of 20 min. After close to the 30 min mark I asked the hostess what the status was on our wait and she said we STILL had two groups on front of us. What we didn't realize is we would of waltzed right in and sat at the bar to order. The hostess could of done a better job by either giving us a more realistic time table, giving us a heads up on how many groups of equal size were in front of us, and/or recommending to us to sit at the bar (provided there was space for four people). Ultimately, we found space for three at the end of the bar. I chose to stand because we did not want to wait any longer and I still had hope the place would redeem themselves via the food.  The servers behind the bar were moderately attentive during our meal. We placed our order for food and drinks with no issue but the next problem was how long the food took to get to us, which was about 20-25 min. I'm a pretty patient person but the wait to sit combined with the wait for food was unacceptable. This is also considering the fact I saw people who came AFTER us get their food first (it looked like one of the workers who might of been the manager of the place knew these people personally). The lachs/lox (smoked salmon) omelette I ordered was good  and my friends seemed to think the food was average for the price ($7 yogurt and granola parfait? really??).  In the end, the ambiance of the restaurant is what I feel attracts people. It seems trendy. You can sit outside and also bring your dog. The female servers are dressed like they just got done with a Crossfit workout session (low-cut workout tank top, yoga pants, and running shoes)...but all of that doesn't cover-up the poor service or average food.  If you are passing through this area, I would recommend looking else where to eat breakfast.",

Got seated pretty quickly and our order taken, however it took FOREVER for us to get our food, other ppl who came in after us had already eaten and left by the time our food had came out.  When the food arrived, 3 out of 4 of our orders were wrong, we let our waitress know and nothing was done about it. We figured we had already waited so long for our food to get here that we just wanted to eat and leave. My food was good and correct thats why im giving 3 stars.   After we were done eating and asked for boxes, we waited probably another 10-15 mins just for the lady to bring us our check.   Terrible service, but good food, if they get your order right. We will have to skip this place next time we are in the area.",

However, they were blatantly flirty with the male customers. I waited 45 minutes for eggs, bacon, and potatoes and it finally came out when I asked about it. When I had asked for utensils to go since I had to run after waiting so long, the server snuck them onto the other side of my table so that I didn't see them, causing me to wait around even longer until I told her I would just grab some myself. She then rudely pointed out that she put them next to me.   Hire new staff and I would love to come back with friends and family (who all agree that there is terrible service at Morning Squeeze). Otherwise, not worth the negative vibes and sloooow service.",

We ordered a chicken waldorf salad and a black and bleu burger with a chicken breast. The chicken in the salad was awesome. In fact, everything in the salad was except for the dressing. It was a yogurt vinaigrette and was...well, pasty? Weird. I asked Amanda, our server to bring some balsamic vinegar and she brought olive oil. Other than that hiccup, our service was fine. We had full drinks and she checked on us frequently. The chicken sandwich was just gross though. Neither of us tasted any cajun on it and it was undercooked. We didnt eat it. When Amanda brought the bill, I said, oh I thought you were doing a BOGO special and she said, \"yeah, If you have the card for it.\" I said to show me where on any of these posts say anything about a card and she couldn't. So, they took off the sandwich we didn't like anyways. I can see this place scratching to stay alive.....sad, considering at one time, this place was so awesome. On a side note, the bartender was so nice, saying hi and bye and he hopes we have a good day etc...",

What was bad was while we were waiting, there were at least 4 tables, that we could see, that were empty but needed to be cleaned. The service was awful, 10 minutes for 1 drink and 45 minutes for our food. The food was mediocre at best. My omelette was cold. The coffee and toast were good, that is the only reason this place gets a star. Save your time and money and go elsewhere. McDs breakfast is at least 10 times better than this place.",

Couple of friends and I went in for a late breakfast on Sunday, there was a little bit of the wait, but to be expected from anyplace nearby that time of day (even Denny's). We all got a variety of items of the menu, from French Toast to Breakfast tacos and everyone loved their food. Couple mimosas for one member of the party as well...  Pros- -Good, diverse menu with plenty to choose from -Pricing was very reasonable, especially for quality of the food -Atmosphere was lively and definitely a laid back feel  Cons- -Can be a wait at popular times (but so is every place) -Kitchen seemed to be overwhelmed at times (one friend who ate here before was served undercooked hash browns, probably from a rush to get food out)  Overall as great of a breakfast place as you'll find around Old Town, especially for the price. Worth a shot to try out if you haven't.",

Other entree, Hillbilly Highrise didn't match the description, no layers of hash browns, a very few laying on the bottom? Chickend Fried Steak was horribly overcooked.  Also was $14.00 with no toast or biscuit or bread of any kind. Large OJ 5.75, think it was out of a gallon jug.  Best new restaurants, thinking NOT. Was excited to go and bummed it is not good.

    "text": "I used to love this place but since moving out to Ahwatukee and Tempe I never got much of a chance to revisit but today I decided to make the drive and have a nice breakfast but I was surely disappointed. Positives first- the atmosphere was super cute. I really like that the patio is dog friendly and even has a doggie section on the menu, way to make fur babies feel like part of the family. My husbands Pitaya bowl was beautifully presented and tasted fantastic. Our waitress was there, not really enjoying being there but enough to do her job, which is all we ask. Now the part I don't like but nonetheless, have to. I ordered a Oreo Mocha to drink, which came out looking like something from a 60's date which was nice but it literally tasted like milky cardboard. I finished what I could and left the rest. I then ordered the Squeeze signature french toast which is made with Corn Flakes and usually very good from what I could remember, but the first batch came out BURNT. Not like one or two pieces but ALL of it burnt. I try to never judge a book by its cover and tried it anyway, see if it tasted better than it looked. BIG mistake!! The char coated the whole inside of my mouth and the taste was the most realist piece of sad I have ever experienced. Eeyore french toast. I had to send it back. The second batch came out a little brighter in color but did not taste like anything that I couldn't have gotten at the hundreds of Jack in the Box's that I passed driving here. Some pieces were hard, some had oil literally oozing out from the butterknife incision point. I should've brought my pimple popping tools. The breakfast potatoes, they were just potatoes, nothing special, ate with ketchup to add flavor. Overall, I feel bad for overselling this place to my husband and probably won't be making that drive anytime soon, if at all.",

I ordered a omelette & so did everyone else at our table. Everyone was happy with their choices. I didn't get hash browns, but I  heard they are great!",

Service has always been great each time we've been here and the staff seems dedicated to the business. If you're looking for something on the healthier side, you're in luck, as they have a ton to offer. If you're hungover and need a rich and decadent breakfast to cure your ailments, Breakfast Club has plenty for that too! Also love the inside/outside feel of having the outside wall open when weather permits (which it most often does).   Will bring guests here when they come in from out of town for sure! Keep it up!",

We were told that there would be a 15 minute wait, but it really ended up being about 25. The hostess apologized and seated us outside (without giving us an option of sitting inside) Our server came out after a bit of sitting outside and took our drink orders. Everything took a little bit longer than we would've liked, but the food came out pretty good. There were a lot of flies outside bothering us, but the food was enjoyable. I recommend the black bean chilaquiles.",

Watched the bartender water down drinks, reserve a Bloody Mary that someone sent back after sitting on the bar for the 20 min. The eggs tasted like they had been microwaved along with the turkey sausage patty, black hash browns (using bad potatoes) and un- toasted toast. Two bites and I was disgusted. I will never walk back into this place again.",

The food was delivered by GrubHub. I ordered the food at 11:04 AM and was told food should arrive between 11:40 to 11:50 AM. Food arrived at approximately 12:15 PM. No big deal.   The woman who delivered the food was very nice. She did mention that she had advised them that I wanted a Vanilla Latte and not a Caramel, so I assume the extra time it took to get the food delivered was due to their mistake. Also, when I had ordered this through the app, it advised to call to get the flavors of Lattes. I called the number, no one answered and it went to a voicemail box which was full. The Latte itself was bland and had no flavor.  My boyfriend and I opened our meals and the first thing we noticed, was the bread was ridiculously stale. He had Rye and I had Wheat. Two totally different types of bread, so you would assume only one of them may have been stale, but both...? Our omelettes we're just average. I noticed what I thought was mold on a bell pepper in the country potatoes...turned out to be a label which was not removed. Poor meal prepping by whomever cut up the bell peppers.   Overall, under-impressed and disappointed. Will not be on my list of places to go in the future...sorry Morning Squeeze.",

Lots of people watching on sidewalk and activity at bars across the street. Only negative is the volume. Acoustics in here make the place very loud when sitting inside, try and get an outdoor patio seat if possible. Considering how packed this place is in the mornings, the service is fast and the servers all friendly.  The food is consistently good. Great breakfast tacos, awesome homemade muffins (snickerdoodle blueberry a favorite!). Their Lox and bagels is served open faced and always fresh and a generous proportion. Their lunch garlic fries, black bean veggie burger and Reuben are some of our favorites. If you love bloody Mary's and bacon, get their Pigs Eye which has bacon vodka and is huge and dressed very cool.   What keeps me from the five star rating is considering this is a breakfast spot, their bread quality is very average and almost always is served cold (by the time it reaches the table) and under-toasted. This after probably 30 plus visits (we live a few blocks away).   Overall, we love Squeeze and love taking all our guests there. Definitely recommend this place!",

The servers are very personable and if you can have some patience you'll get what you need. They definitely care about helping you, however if you don't have a patience cap, go somewhere else.  We sat in a booth next to the kitchen and you could definitely see a ton of the breakfast tacos going out, which I would likely get next time. I opted to get the creme brulee pancakes, which were... Good, however they lacked anything other than pancakes. I felt they were missing something, like you know- another taste of flavor of some sort. Was sort of bored and only ate half of it.  If it weren't for our sweet waitress Briana, being, sweet.. I would've rated the experience even lower however she made the wait, extreme noise level and the marginal food acceptable.",

    "text": "I was excited to eat here because it looked full every time I drove by. My husband and I came through during the tail end of brunch (on a Saturday). We were seated immediately and our server checked in on us. We weren't ready to order drinks so she made her rounds and checked in again. We asked for one more minute.. It was our first time here so we were thorough in reading the menu. We decided what we wanted, my husband went to and returned from the restroom, and still no server. 10 or so minutes had passed before our server came by and asked if anyone had taken care of us because they changed sections. If you are or have ever been a server before, which is the case for my husband and I, you can imagine our list of judgements and critiques was growing. She took our order and that was that. Our food arrived about 15 mins later. The expo didn't even give us a chance to look at our plate before walking off. After waiting more than 5 minutes my husband went up to the bar to request butter for the toast and ketchup for the breakfast potatoes *not impressed that a restaurant wouldn't plate butter and ketchup with toast and potatoes or at least train expos/servers to ask if their guest needs any condiments. A few minutes later our server checked in, at which point we had everything we needed. We finished our food... The southwestern omelet and chorizo tacos, both of which were good but had no wow to them. Our server dropped off our check and comped one of the meals. An appreciated gesture that really would not have been necessary had our server been present especially after discovering that in the section change we were forgotten. No matter how good the food may be, the poor experience is what keeps people from coming back.",

All for a total that was higher than what it should have been. I called them to tell them about what happened and they seemed pretty reluctant to give me any sort of compensation. When I went back to get my compensation (not a refund, mind you), they refused to tell me how much was on the card. I had to ask to speak with the hostess' manager. The manager came up and acted like I was asking the world of her to see how much was on the giftcard they gave me. After waiting 10 minutes and finally getting the amount, the manager handed me my giftcard without even the slightest apology. She simply stated \"here.\" Bad customer service.",

The only thing I'd change is that the fruit has been hit or miss as far as taste and ripeness.

We didn't make a fuss about anything though and our meals were mediocre. The food didn't stand out at all. Also, we waited 30 minutes after being done eating (and nobody clearing our plates) we had to go to the host stand to ask for our check.

I typically opt to bypass the wait for a table and grab a seat at the bar during busy brunch hours and I do enjoy the indoor/outdoor seating options. The outdoor side of the bar was a little toasty throughout the summer, but the indoor side stayed surprisingly cool. Maybe a little crunched if the bar is packed, but not bad.  The food was mediocre - nothing bad or cooked improperly, but nothing drool-inducing. The brussel sprout salad was good, alebit very heavy on dressing which was a touch too sweet for my taste. The omelettes are sizable with good filling choices, but the breakfast potatoes seemed a little...generic. My hubby had a sandwich that was also unremarkable, but the Bloody Mary's were delicious. Their canine menu is cute and I'm glad we have another place that welcomes pups on the side patio.   Overall I like the vibe and the eats are alright. The beverages are tasty and the staff is fairly welcoming (though we've had a couple of inattentive bartenders, no one has been unfriendly). I would recommend this to others and out of towners for a pleaseant meal with a decent price.",

The decor is adorable, with bright, spring colors. Unfortunately it was too cold to dine outside, so we were sat indoors. The booths are bright green and quite roomy-I wondered what this place was beforehand? My boyfriend seems to think it used to be a sushi restaurant.    Our server was Lauren, and she was really friendly and helpful with the menu. My boyfriend and I ordered mimosas and coffee, and drinks came relatively quickly.  The menu is rather extensive with both breakfast and lunch choices. I opted to order the Scottsdale Burrito (egg whites, tomato, spinach, goat cheese and hash browns), and my boyfriend ordered the My Eggs My Way. Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, and was delicious!   Overall, my experience with Morning Squeeze was a good one. Although they just opened, I feel like they are a very promising restaurant. I had realistic expectations that were far exceeded by the excellent service and delicious food.

    "text": "About us:  My husband (hubster) and I live in Scottsdale and go out to breakfast once every weekend.  I try to pick a different place each time because I'm adventurous and we haven't yet found a place to become a regular favorite.    This review is for the:  Morning Squeeze, Scottsdale Road location   Summary:  Atmosphere lacking for me, but food good.  A little spendy for what it is, but comparable prices for Old Town, so that's perfectly okay (total bill for 2 was $30and change, +tip = $37; a little much for standard  breakfast fare for 2, but not bad for Old Scottsdale). Service was decent, too.  Love the dog friendly patios.  Cute to see a waitress carrying a tray with water glasses on one hand, and a dog-bowl with water in it in the other hand. :-)  The atmosphere:  This is a little place on a corner on the North edge of Old Scottsdale.  It's a sit-down breakfast/lunch restaurant.  It is VERY noisy, with the exception of the North patio, which has doors to mitigate the sound of the restaurant but only has about 5 or 6 small (2 person) tables in it.  It was full, so we couldn't sit there, but we were able to get a table outside on the West side, right along Scottsdale Road; better, but not ideal because the West side of the restaurant is open-air with a bar and seating flowing onto the patio - no walls to shut out the noise of the inside (and music a bit much, too).  On seating outside:  While it's a cute, upbeat, trendy environment with nice looking booths inside, it was also way too NOISY.  Seriously - like a night club -  not how I like to start off my Sunday morning.  I want to relax and enjoy my breakfast and Sunday morning, not jump into it screaming like a cold shower.  Even outside, hubster and I had to shout across our little bar topper table to talk with one another.  There's no way I would have made it through the meal indoors.  Fortunately, it's now the end of October, so the weather is finally allowing outdoor seating to be possible.  Service:  They have lots of nice, pretty, young waitresses whose service is just fine.  Ours checked in with us two or three times during the meal and came to the table promptly to get us started with drinks (which was quick) and then take our order.  The only wait was maybe 5ish minutes to get the bill when we were done.  No problem.  That's 4-5 touches on our table, which is perfectly fine for breakfast considering we never even finished our coffees.  Speaking of which...  Food:  Oy, terrible coffee.  Bitter, super hot, and way, way too strong.  So much that, for me, three sugars and the whole little cup of creamer and some ice cubes barely made a dent in taming it.  But, if you like super strong, hot, bitter coffee, you're going to love it!  Hubster and I never even drank enough of it to get refills, though.  I had an orange ricotta pancake (delish - although there's no ricotta on it so it must be in it) and biscuits and gravy. The gravy tastes like the canned variety, but I happen to like that flavor and thought it was good; husband was more \"meh\" on it.  Hubster had bacon, eggs, gravy, chick fried steak; standard breakfast things.  He said it was fine - pretty neutral on it.  I loved that they garnished his plate with fresh fruit, which he doesn't like, but I do - works for me 'cuz I ate it!  Overall, I'd say the food was okay.  Also, the morning alcoholic beverage menu looked really good.  If I had any inclination to drink booze in the morning, this would be an excellent choice.  End result:  We probably won't go back unless we're in the area and see that there's seating open on the North side.",

A couple sat about 20 minutes after us and got their food 30 minutes before us. The manager talked to them and apologized for the wait but ignored us even though we had waited about 30 minutes to order food and  70 minutes from the time we sat down to actually eat.  I am disappointed and I would not recommend anyone to return.  The service was sad and the food was not  tasty enough to compensate for the timing and server attitude.",

The last two times we've been, my fiances hashbrowns were completely covered in salt and pepper to the point that they were inedible, they sent replacements out probably 15 min later after we were done eating. Today they forgot her hashbrowns completely, when they brought them out a few minutes later, they were swimming in oil. The rest of the food has been decent, nothing to rave about. Their service has gone down a bit, like trying to get our server to come back so we can actually tell them whats wrong, and for some reason they crossed off fresh fruit on the menu and don't include that with the meal anymore. Really just writing this to try and help you guys figure it out, but I cant say whether I would go back again at this point.",

Not only do the servers take forever to greet you, but they take forever to bring your drink and they'll leave the food under the heater for 10 minutes before they bring it to you.....all while the place isn't even busy...I've been here a few times in the past 4 years because I work close by.  I swear every time I decide to give it another try, I get a similar experience.  It usually has to do with the servers they hire. I don't know if they all have zero IQ's or what, but I swear there is nothing going on upstairs in a few of those girls minds. The most recent time I gave this place a shot I ordered a sandwich on gluten free bread. The server let the food sit under the heater for 10 minutes before bringing it over with a regular bun on it. When I asked for the gluten free bread again she just said \"oh\". Fast forward another 15 minutes, still no bread....she came to check on us and meanwhile I'm not able to eat my meal. We complained to the manager who was nice to comp the meal. Unfortunately, this place needs to get it together.",

We ordered it after we all had an egg \"dish\".  Everything was really good.  Our friends loved the chicken fried steak and biscuits/gravy, we loved the different eggs...omelets, scrambles, and enjoyed tasting each other's entrees.  Then we split the yummy Tuscan toast.  Delish! Enjoyed sitting on their patio!  We had to wait a few minutes b/c they are quite popular, but well worth the wait.    You must go here if you're visiting Scottsdale!

We arrived at the restaurant before noon and were seated immediately on the patio with our dog, who loved all the attention and pets from the waitresses. The weather was perfect outside, so it was a little bothersome to have multiple blazing heaters above us. But our young and polite waitress came over with waters for us and the pup. Service was very fast and friendly, which is why Im giving them five stars!! We ordered ourselves orange juice cocktails and food (the VW Squeeze was an  on point egg sandwich!) and decided to treat our doggo to the \"pup-cakes and gravy\" and she devoured it! It was all a tad overpriced, but I dont mind treating myself to a quality brunch once in a while, and I'll definitely go back to the Squeeze with my family soon!",

After explaining our situation the owner/manager was extremely helpful and put us in a booth right away. It made for a wonderful brunch and meant a lot to my family. It was a True showing of high class and on top of that the food was excellent. The only knock against the place would have to be the amount of time it took to get our food.

Same layout as before just different color scheme to Jimmy's, there's 2 bars (one outdoors and one indoors, outdoor patio seating and indoor seating).

Our waitress seemed like she wanted to be anywhere but there and was impossible to find most of the time. Two people at our group ordered coffee and she never came around to give them a refill. The food was ok but I honestly could have made the same stuff at my house and I'm not even a great cook. I'm not totally writting them off...I know they just opened so I'm hoping that they will work out the kinks. I'll probably try them again in a couple months...I won't be rushing back next weekend!",

    "text": "I think this place will be around a long time because of the location, hip/cutesy decor, and full bar featuring 92,347 variations on a Bloody Mary. I think you end up paying for style with little substance.  The menu is pretty big. My group had a salad with chicken and a fancy sandwich. The \"local greens\" in the salad turned out to be iceberg lettuce, which was disappointing. The sandwich was okay, but the \"side of fries\" consisted of 14 fries. The coffee, on the other hand, was quite good. We didn't have anything from the bar.  Service was okay overall.  Perhaps the bar drinks are great or the huge menu is has some great options, but I don't think I'll be back.",

    "text": "Morning squeeze is a cute little breakfast and lunch place that when you first walk in is a fun carefree atmosphere. So why did I give it just two stars? We were seated in front of the open faced kitchen in a booth and there were only about two other groups in the restaurant. Briana, our server, came over three minutes later with water. Asked if we needed anything to drink. We asked for coffee and orange juice and waited another 7 minutes for it to arrive. We finally get to order. I got a side of biscuits and gravy for $4 and an egg scrambled for $1.50. My friend ordered sausage patties for $4  and we split a Belgium waffle for $6. We were pretty pleased with the prices. So Briana put in our order and we waited. And waited. And waited. Our food was ready in the window less than 3 feet from our table for 10 minutes while our server was up at the front counter with the hostess. We watched our food get cold and even contemplated going and picking it up from the window ourselves. Finally our server walked up to the window and grabbed our food turned around and handed it to us. My biscuits turned out great and the waffle was amazing. The sausage patties though we're roughly the size oft he face on my watch. Tiny. For the same price as the giant biscuits and gravy. We ate and finished most of it. Then a busser came by and took our plates. We didn't see our server for another 8 minutes after we finished. She finally came by to give us our check and we got our our cards and gave them to her to avoid waiting for her again. She paid us out and said good bye. We gave her a 20% tip that she did not deserve and left. On the way out the cooks yelled from the kitchen to have a great day and that was probably the best service we received the whole time we were there. The food was decent but it really didn't make up for the rest. My friend and I are both servers and we understand a lot when it comes to this kind of stuff. But Briana was terrible. And we can say for sure we will never go back to Morning Squeeze.",

I like that they have a good selection of coffee drinks as opposed to just having plain old boring coffee with cream.

    "text": "Sitting in the exterior portion of the bar this morning in a bustling Morning Squeeze was reminiscent of being on a cruise.  The mild weather and breeze, the tropical colors of the decor, the permeating smell of bacon, and the clatter of dishes and silverware all felt like the breakfast buffet on the lido deck of a Caribbean cruise liner.  The food provided a similar feeling in that it was good to be hard to find specific complaints, but not so good as to be memorable in and of itself.  That's fine on a cruise because breakfast is nothing more than an opportunity to fuel up before a day of shore excursions, and honestly for a hip Scottsdale breakfast spot there may not be any need to have great food to attract a crowd.  For my money, I want better than tolerable for a $17 out-the-door price for coffee, meal, and tip because there are plenty of better, cheaper breakfast spots in the area and many of those have the added benefit of not being the starting point for Sunday-Funday.  Much like a Caribbean cruise, the staff and patrons were all attractive and well put together for a 9:30 breakfast; most being dressed as lightly as politely acceptable.  In a way, it's a continuation or new start to the Scottsdale social scene, with pickups still occurring.  Every part of the service at the bar was prompt.  Quickly provided water and menu, my Americano came out quickly and all the usual barrista questions were asked (which comes down to \"hot or cold?\"), and once I assumed the I've-looked-at-the-menu-and-am-ready-to-order pose a bartender was there to take my order.  I witnessed a food-prep snafu regarding the diners beside me--their order was taking a while so they asked the bartender to check on it.  She promptly investigated and was quite candid in letting them know that the kitchen didn't put together their custom sandwich (a menu option) correctly and redid it.  A minute or so later she came back to let the diners know their meals would be comped.  It was an impressive level of candor and remedy in a situation that could easily have been covered up.  The food, as indicated above, was satisfying but not exceptional.  It's not something I'm in a hurry to return for...  I had the country fried steak and eggs--two eggs any style, hash browns or country potatoes, toast, some fruit, and country fried steak with sausage gravy atop.  The steak could have really used a crisper fry and some more breading to give it a nice crunch and to provide a vehicle for some pepper.  Otherwise, it was tasty and the sausage gravy was a good topping.  The rest of the dish 'was what I thought it was'...which is to say, eggs and toast and potatoes are routine.  My neighbors' dishes looked underwhelming.  3 of the 4 had a breakfast sandwich, which was served without a side.  I'm not sure if that's by choice or design, but it definitely makes for an unimpressive plate.  The remaining person ordered french toast, which looked amazing in that it seemed to have the crispy batter my steak lacked, but also was plated and served with no accompaniment than syrup--the side of bacon had to be specifically ordered separately.  In a way, perhaps, Morning Squeeze is the perfect metaphor for Scottsdale - everything looks nice, but scratch the surface and you'll find the beauty is only skin deep...despite that, you'll still find yourself satisfied and ok with enjoying good looks.  Ok, that's a little dramatic, but I'm more focused on football than metaphor right now.",

My mother was visiting Arizona for the first time so me and my girlfriend decided to take her to a late breakfast. We had never been to this restaurant but I always saw a crowd so I figured we should check it out. After a short 20 minute wait we were seated and Briana took our order. She was very nice and even complimented my girlfriend on her curly hair. At no fault of our server, the wait time for the food was very long. She brought us a complimentary bowl of fruit and apologized frequently. Two of their cooks had called in sick on a Sunday and the kitchen was backed up. Once the food arrived we all were very pleased and Briana asked that we come back so she could show us that the wait times that we experienced aren't typical. I recently purchased a home nearby and now i feel that we have a breakfast restaurant that we can go to when we want to get out the house. Thank you Briana, you were awesome!!!",

The meat wasn't terrible, but no seasoning to speak of.  Not the greatest cut of meat.  And I had to rip through it with the butter knife too which I thought was odd..  My friend got a sausage and mushroom omelet.  It was decent.  I don't think I like the hashed browns but the country potatoes were solid.  I would like to try the egg white omelets they have before final judgement, but definitely never getting eggs over easy again!",

My bf asked if he could get his food instead of it sitting on the counter getting cold waiting for mine.  When mine came out the sandwich was pretty good but i paid extra money for garlic fries which was literally plain fries on top of a couple pieces of garlic that were basically cut in huge pieces and not cooked, you couldnt even see the garlic until u dug it out from the bottom of the plate but even then who wants a huge slice of raw garlic on their fry that wont even stick to it u have to put some ketchup on it first to stick the garlic to it. My bfs biscuit and gravy was hard as a rock and sent it back. I work at a breakfast joint so i guess im more critical to basics. On the plus side the oj and iced tea was great",

    "text": "2 stars for now. I know they just opened but...  First of all, a star for the decor and ambiance. It's so cute and colorful and comfy! We were worried there would be a wait (the place seemed packed) but were able to snag a spacious booth overlooking the kitchen. This may seem like a great idea, but I was able to watch food get sent back (3 different meals in the time we waited for ours) and see how long certain plates were left under hot lamps. Being able to watch the kitchen in action is neat in theory, but if you're well-versed in the ways of restaurant life, you'll catch these problems easily.  Another star for service. Our server was sweet but slow...because I think she was overwhelmed. She would disappear for long stretches (as in, I couldn't find her in the whole place) and it took forever for coffee refills because they were out of glasses. Again, I don't fault her at all. I think that she must have been slammed. Every table in the place was taken.  The food? Well. I ordered the Scottsdale burrito, and subbed cheddar for the goat cheese. Instead, it came with no cheese. The menu promised hash browns inside the burrito...and they were, and they were frozen shreds with no crisp or color to them. They blended in with the egg whites. Dammit.  Boyfriend ordered the Odelay scramble, with a microscopic amount of chorizo. His side of breakfast potatoes was tasty, at least. Why couldn't they put THOSE potatoes in the burrito? Everything was just underwhelming.   The place has a gigantic breakfast and lunch menu...maybe scale back and focus on making a smaller amount of items, but doing them REALLY well? We both agreed we'd give them one more shot if we're in the area and only if there isn't a wait. Otherwise, there are just too many solid breakfast places in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "There is a reason this restaurant has a line out the door on the weekends. It's because they have a good breakfast, a decent patio and they are dog friendly! We've eaten breakfast here a couple of times and have been lucky both times to not have to wait for a table. We came one time with our dog Harley and he had a blast! In fact, they have a special menu for dogs. Yes, dogs! We ordered Harley the Pup cakes for dogs which are pancakes and gravy. Harley gobbled it up in about three bites! I enjoyed the omelet which was also tasty but I think Harley enjoyed his meal more. All in all, this is a great breakfast nook and one you should visit!",

We can early enough, around 8am so there wasn't a wait but when we left at 9ish, the line was out the door.  Here are my pros: - Huge, diverse and well explained menu. There is something for everyone here. I was boring and got the basic eggs and sausage plate, and it was delicious but I should have been adventurous. Mom got the Denver Omelette and she finished it wish a huge grin, loved it! - Pets are allowed! As a dog lover I couldn't be happier that this was a pet friendly place. - Price, very fair! Nothing was really over $12 and the portions were generous. - Healthy and fresh ingredients  Cons: - At times the wait was a little much but it's popular so what can we expect?   Overall, be sure to try it if you're in the area!",

The place was busy with tables but we choose to sit on the patio.  With the hot Arizona heat, it was too bad sitting at the bar.  I would recommend installing some misters.  The service was very good.  We got our Hibiscus Mimosa and Iced coffee within in minutes of sitting down.  I went healthy for breakfast and tried the Squeeze Scramble.  The scramble includes turkey sausage, egg whites, mushrooms and onions.  I added country potatoes and an English muffin to the meal.  My friend tried the Grilled Cheese with truffle fries.  The truffle fries were amazing.    I have no complaints with my visit at the Morning Squeeze and I hope to make many more visits.  They have an extensive menu and I had a hard time making a decision on breakfast.  I wish they would be open for dinner.  I love having breakfast for dinner.",

We were given a 20 minute wait time and probably waited only 10. Our server was very attentive and made a point to let us know that they were busy that morning and the kitchen was a little backed up, but if there was anything she could do to make our wait better to let us know. She checked on us a few times while we waited to give us updates on our food.   I ordered the breakfast tacos and omg they were so good. Really simple with just eggs, bacon and jack cheese with sour cream, salsa and pico on the side but good quality food. I want to go back for brunch again this weekend just to have them again!",

There was a bit of a wait when we got there but the front advised an accurate wait time and you can sit in some chairs in the shade while you wait outside. Pets are allowed on the patio and there were some cute puppies we also played with while waiting. The patio covers most of the different breakfast options you would expect. The mimosa flight was a tasty option, the kitchen was a bit slow so we ended up getting a second one on the house as well. I ordered the bagel and lox which was a full meal with lots of toppings and other table members had pancakes and one ordered off the lunch menu. Portions were large and prices were reasonable, even with the exchange rate it was less than most Calgary spots charge for brunch which is what I am used to.",

A very nice indoor/outdoor restaurant that even has a pet friendly area located in Old Town Scottsdale.   We of course started off with coffee. I then ordered the Mexican Breakfast Burrito which has scrambled eggs, hash browns, black beans, chorizo with melted cheese & salsa. I was given a choice of red or green sauce I choose the red. The wife ordered the Halls Oats N nuts waffle which is also served with their homemade granola, pecans, walnuts and powdered sugar. She also had a side of sausage links.   The service was quick and everyone was very friendly. It definitely seems like a popular place even on a semi chilly morning like today.",

The acai was picture perfect but wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It wasn't layered and just seemed like a pile of yogurt.. there were also some pieces of fruit what were basically frozen..   I ordered grapefruit mimosa and the ratio of champagne to grapefruit was fantastic in my book!",

This place went from me and my spouses favorite breakfast spot in town to making the wait at Breakfast Club worth it. While the food wasn't bad and the service didn't lack, it just felt as though whoever rewrote the menus, did everything they could to make it feel as generic as possible. Unfortunately after countless great visits, something like this isn't as easy to turn around as getting the wrong server on the wrong day. Sad to say but we won't be coming back. Such a bummer man.",

They no longer had the items my boyfriend wanted either. We decided to stay and get something close to our usuals but it turned out very disappointing. The food was flavorless and nothing special. We asked our server about the menu change & she said the new chef decided to simplify the menu. Sad to say we will not be returning.",

Stop putting pork in my food!!!!!!!! --- beware if you don't eat pork or meat for religious reasons).  My second visit, I brought family and each thing one person ordered...several times...was out of stock/unavailable. Later, one person came to clarify an item ordered, then told us one of the ingredients (green chile...) was actually available \"we're not out...that's weird\". So, two people tried to change their order accordingly...only to have it brought it out as originally told. Yeah, that's weird.  So, overall, good but not great food, but incredibly inconsistent. Therefore the ample better options available in the breakfast/brunch scene will get my business.",

I decided to come back today and the same exact meal was less than average (giving it a 3 star because my boyfriend's breakfast tacos were amazing).   The problem I have is I did the check-in offer for a free bottomless cup of coffee and when I showed the waitress my Yelp app before she brought the check, she told me that her manager has told them they can only accept those IF WE WRITE A REVIEW FOR THEM. Uhhh, no. That's not how this works. First off - it's a check in offer and I checked in for the free coffee. Secondly - I worked at Yelp for 3.5 years and this is AGAINST ALL OF THE RULES. What's sad is they're basically paying people to write them reviews and they still can't get above 3.5 stars overall. Well, here's your review that you asked for. Thanks for the coffee!  **** I was expecting a manager to come speak to me while I was in the restaurant but never did. Glad the manager is now gonna tell me I'm misunderstanding when they're lying that anything was said. The only thing that happened was the server felt awkward by my comment and took the coffee off my bill. No one apologized or talked to me about it.",

I also had egg whites, onion, bell pepper, turkey sausage scramble with hash browns and toast. The toast was cold and the hash browns were meh. I love me some good hash browns!

It was a bit pricey and the added toppings were especially pricey, but it was worth it. The only thing I didn't love was the iced white chocolate mocha, it was okay but i've had better. Overall, this is now one of my favorite breakfast restaurants and i definitely recommend.",

The first time was really good but yesterday I ordered \"Avocado Toast\" and the avocados were so rock hard that I couldn't mash them with a fork and they had a really chewy and starchy texture. I think if the avocados aren't ripe enough yet they should just temporarily take the item off the menu rather than serve bad food. There was also a large smear of blood on the barstool seat next to me (I can only imagine what that's from) I know it's not their fault but maybe have a busser circle around periodically to make sure the place is clean. My server was nice which is why my rating is decent. I'll come back if I get invited by a friend but won't do the avocado toast",

Best to go with friends who stayed over from the night before, cuz that's what everybody around you will be shouting about, lol.  It IS noisy, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're in the mood for it.  Fairly inexpensive as well.

Then, they said they couldn't accommodate us at 1 table and tried to sit us in a booth and table, even though we saw other large groups who were accommodated. We had to ask for that before they put 2 tables together. Then, it took 15 minutes before she even took our order. And as I write this, we have been waiting over 40 minutes for our food. Being from New York, I've been to my share of terrible establishments. But this by far is one of the worst places I've ever been to.

Hash browns were not good, and they only served one piece of toast with the CFS, which isn't a deal breaker, but it wasn't a good tasting piece of toast. I want to give it another shot, but Mr. S says no. Bumskis, morning squeeze!",

    "text": "I'm starting to believe I may be a service snob......but I just have to believe it is not THAT hard to give good service! I have been wanting to try this place- always trying to expand my brunch options! My sister and I put our name in and waited on the beach chairs out front (Love those!) and people watched. Our name was called and they put us at a booth inside. We noticed 2 high tops were available on the patio. I asked for one and she sat us out there. (Have no hostesses ever played \"Sally's Diner\"?! Gotta maximize and not use up all your 4 tops with just 2 people!)   Our server was nice....but not very experienced. My sister asked for a coffee recommendation and the caramel latte she got was almost minty. Not delish. I had just a coffee....which was rarely filled unless I asked. At one point I asked her to \"warm up\" my coffee a \"little bit.\" She poured a tiny amount in and asked if it was okay. Haha Gotta get up on your brunch lingo, girl! Plus, I feel like I should never have to ask for a refill. Maybe that makes me a diva. What ever. We waited quite a while for our food (okay it was a Saturday morning-I can understand that.) BUT! When our food came it was luke warm at best. She never asked how our food was and dropped off our check with a \"yep.\" No- we didn't want anything else, or a box, or anything..... Our plates were never cleared. We ended up walking the bill up to our server at the hostess stand....where she was standing and not refilling my coffee. ;-)  The food would have been good if it was hot but the service REALLY killed it for us. It was kind if painful being able to see The Breakfast Club from where I was sitting...next time I'll probably go there.",

We said thank you but we were going to check somewhere else and may be back because we were hungry. We came back about 5 minutes later and I asked her to put my name in and she literally gave me the rudest laugh and didn't make any eye contact and said \"yeah sure I guess\" and then I said \"thank you\" and she RUDELY said \"yep\". What ... Was... Her problem? Won't be back. Don't want to go back. I can only imagine what the rest of the staff was like. I'll take my business elsewhere.",

Many times over the course of over 45 minutes, I was told my order was on its way.   I'd have to think long and hard to recall the last time a patron who arrived after me was served before me but in this instance it occurred multiple times.  My order was as simple as it gets - a fit bowl of brown rice, quinoa and chicken.  So much time had lapsed that even though the hostess mentioned she wouldn't charge me, I felt it was time to get up and leave.  I told her I needed to go and relayed to a colleague to tell the kitchen to put the item in a to-go bag whenever it was finished being prepped.  About two minutes later, after nearly an hour in total, my item came and I exited out the door.  When I opened the box and saw the food, I was shocked at how something that easy to prep could take so long.  The apology I received is appreciated but unfortunately does not make up for this horrible experience.  I have to leave one star.",

The food presentation was beyond bad. Food was slapped onto a plate with no presentation in mind. Ordered a omelet with bell peppers and potatoes on the side. When the plate came out, it had bell peppers with egg residue scattered among the potatoes. It would be easier to deal with bad service with decent food, but that was not the case.

So what makes Morning Squeeze cool?  The location.   Morning Squeeze is located right in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale on Scottsdale Road at 4th Avenue half way between Indian School and Camelback.   The layout.   The main dining room opens up to the patio so every seat has a view of Scottsdale Road. This makes hanging out with friends and people watching super fun.  The menu.  Morning Squeeze combines traditional breakfast with fresh, organic, locally grown ingredients.   There is a wide variety of omelettes, eggs Benedict/poached egg plates including the classic, Cali Bene (with avocado & asparagus), Pulled Pork & veggie patty.   There is French toast, crepes and pancakes including a healthy choice: Power Protein Pancake with protein, natural oats & flaxseed.   Morning Squeeze has all sorts of unique takes on traditional lunch items too - featuring salads, sandwiches, burgers and more.   The menu is outstanding and it would be impossible to ever get bored eating here.

We had eaten here the week before and everything was amazing so we decided to go again. The service was great but the Benedict was barely warm, the toast was stale, hash browns undercooked, and I found a piece of metal in the omelet!!!!!!! We told our server, gave her the the piece of metal, and she immediately went to speak with a manager... but came back only to say \"you're good to go, we took care of the bill.\" This is definitely not what we were looking for... we weren't looking for anything for free rather than just tell somebody about our experience so they could improve and not have this happen again. If it would have been handled properly, I would probably give it another try but we won't be back.",

    "text": "I was there about two weeks ago with a couple of friends, it was a Monday morning. The food was good and our server was nice.  After we paid we decided to stop at the bar on the way out for a round of tequila shots.  We ordered three shots of Jose Cuervo( pretty sure it was gold, gross I know but we wanted something cheap).  The bartender left for a couple minutes to ask a manager how much to charge for it because they didn't have it in their system.   She came back gabbed a big glass of ice and started pouring the tequila. We didn't want it chilled but it wasn't a big deal. I counted her pour, it was no where near three shots. Then she shook it like hell.  She poured what was in the cup into three glasses. The tequila started out gold, and was now clear, and tasted like I was drinking water out of a glass that previously had been used for tequila. My friend had already ran her card, I looked at it and noticed we were charged for Patron, since they didn't have a button. So we are sitting there with our $10 shots of watered down tequila trying to decide what to do. We didn't want to come off as rude, and I normally don't complain.  I have worked in the industry the majority of my life and there are just some things that aren't cool. L  I said something along the lines of I don't think this is a full shot, and she went on to say it might just look small because they are in bigger glasses. I told her I counted with her when she pounded it and it was not enough. And it was a brand new bottle, so we could see how much was poured. So she took a glass and poured a shot of straight tequila and put it next to our glasses. She said \"See you even have a tiny bit more than a shot\".  I had to explain when you shake something with ice for as long as she did the ice melts and the volume increases, a chilled shot shouldn't be one tiny swallow that tastes like water. She responded with \"well I don't know how to fix this\". So we said it's fine never mind. My friend even left her a 20% tip. I'm sure she would remember us if she read this. Maybe the bar staff needs a refresher on the basics, and how to better resolve issues.",

It's delicious and definitely one of the healthier options available from Morning Squeeze's robust menu choices. I've gone with the pancakes a few times as well and they are nearly impossible to finish. Fabulous though, especially with peanut butter chips :)",

It looked wonderful!! :D 4. It tasted GREAT! :D We looked at each other and said, \"Oh yeah!!!' in unison. WE had a new favorite restaurant for delivery :) happy dance :)  Then, a couple of days later, we passed it on the street, turned around, and headed in the glass front door adjacent to the DOG FRIENDLY patio area (another gold star for them!). Cheery people, a breeze wafting in through the open bar windows, and immediate wait staff. It was a friendly slice of 'cafe-style' heaven.  Bottom line: Food was hotter, fresher, and just as wonderful as before :D  OUR new best 'friend' for SURE!!!  We rarely eat out anymore because the foods upset our stomachs AND we're vegetarian - no good choices (your options are: lettuce, peppers, and tofu!)  BUT... this is the place for it ALL!!

I was asking for a time so that could get drinks at the bar.  Food: It's soso. Nothing great like a signature item that would make me return.

    "text": "We were on the hunt for a breakfast place outside of Tempe, and Morning Squeeze caught our attention. There are two that I am aware of: the one on Mill is actually much closer to where I live. However, this one is easy to access right on North Scottsdale, with ample parking available.   Despite a 9:30 AM weekend arrival, we were pleased to find plenty of available seats. I like how the restaurant is set up: there are spacious booths that make up the interior. A large bar takes up the space in the front, and plenty of outdoor tables occupy the perimeter. It's a cozy yet open spot for breakfast.   I am a coffee man; my girlfriend prefers lattes. The coffee was nothing to write home about, but for a first-time experience, I was certainly pleased with a hot cup of caffeine to start the day. As for the latte -- best way I can describe it is that it tasted funny. I thought it was the milk; my girlfriend thought it was the espresso. Might've not been the best call to order a large on the first go.  We appreciated the friendliness and attentiveness of our waitress. Food service was swift. There were a couple things on the menu I was interested in trying, and I ultimately went with the omelet. I wasn't too keen on the menu options for the omelet, so I ordered it \"My Way\" with Swiss cheese, bacon, tomatoes, and mushrooms, a side of country potatoes and wheat bread.   Unfortunately, the best part of this dish was the bread.   The omelet came out quite dry, as if it had been pressed a few times to ensure maximum doneness. The ingredients inside were just fine, but goodness, any semblance of fluffiness from the eggs was gone and forgotten.   Onto the country potatoes. Forgive me, but I did not recognize these creatures as country potatoes. They were airy, golden cubes that captured a hint of potato -- similar to what you might find in the frozen food section. Even the occasional colorful piece which resembled a bell pepper did not rise to the occasion of passable seasoning. Between the dryness of the omelet and the molecular ambiguity that was the potatoes, I cannot be sure which was more displeasing.   I frown in the general direction of Morning Squeeze because I expected more from a venue with a fine location, pleasing setup, and excellent staff; these anchor a sturdy, yet tentative, 3-star review. I am willing and hopeful to change my mind, and I will make a point to return to Morning Squeeze. Until that day comes, I declare, \"Eh.\"",

My husband's breakfast was a total disaster. His toast was over toasted and hard.  He ordered hash browns and they gave him potatoes. And his eggs were not over medium.

Biscuits and gravy were very good.  Eggs Benedict was a little on the bland side. Could definitely use some more flavor. Same with the potatoes.  The hangover bowl was ok, but nothing to write home about.  Overall, good experience. Would likely come back for the biscuits and gravy, but anything else I'd probably go somewhere else.",

It had potatoes, black beans, cheese and green chili with pork.  My husband ordered the corn beef hash potatoes and eggs. They should've called potato hash with a little bit of corn beef, because it wasn't really that much corn beef lots of potatoes and it came with one piece of toast. Needless to say we found the food extremely boring, spiced list, lifeless, and the green chili I was extremely disappointed in because it really had no flavor to it, it did have big chunks of pork.  I wouldn't bother.  To many places to chose from that would be so much better.",

While I don't have the \"old\" menu committed to memory, the new menu appears to be a very limited selection of the old menu.  I enjoy skillets and pancakes.  The Protein Pancakes are awesome, I used to order them with bananas and nuts, neither of which is available on the menu now.  I also used to enjoy the Morning Squeeze Skillet, again, no longer available on the menu.  In fact, there is only one skillet available - the Green Chili Pork menu.  In fact, the menu is limited to a single page with breakfast and lunch items on a single page.    I love the location, indoor/outdoor seating configuration, ambience of the restaurant - it is fun.  The orange juice is delicious.    I will dine here again when location is important, but when I really want range in options, will dine elsewhere.",

Also, tried to tell my friend that her iced coffee she sent back was made properly.  It was not.   After 20 minutes, we finally received corrected tabs.  There was never an apology for confused orders, miscommunications or delays.  Just bad attitude by the manager. It's too bad since it is a cute place and food (that was ordered correctly) was good.",

    "text": "The best thing to come out of our visit to this place was the discovery of the french restaurant next door. Morning Squeeze could have been great had it not been for their hungover, unwashed, uppity clientele.   My husband and I and our infant decided to have breakfast one Sunday morning, It was nice out so we ate on the patio. Their patio is dog-friendly, as are we, even though we left our furry friends at home.  Enter the most annoying man alive. This guy in his late 30s was dining with what might have been a date (probably his last) and his long haired dachshund. He proceeded to talk to every person on the patio except his date. Whether you wanted to or not, this guy was going to talk to you. All about him and his stupid little dog. Then he went on and on about how he knows the manager. Is it Brian? Because that's the name he kept dropping. Like anyone cares that you know the restaurant manager. Seriously. STOP ANNOYING PEOPLE!!!  So the fun happened when two guys and their pitbull mix and sharpei mix sat on the patio. Let me say these dogs were really well behaved. They laid down next to their owners and slept. UNTIL this chatty idiot with the dachshund decided to let his dog off leash. You know the phrase \"Let sleeping dogs lie?\" Apparently this guy hasn't. He let his doxie run right up to these two sleeping dogs that were like 100 times its size. Needless to say a dog fight ensued just  feet away from our infant.   Dear Morning Squeeze: You need to require that four legged visitors be kept on a leash at all times and supervised by their owner.  I had no idea I was putting my child in danger by ordering eggs benedict and coffee on a Sunday morning.  I won't be back. I'll be at the quiet Au Petite Four next door enjoying gigantic crepes.",

Thankfully our server took good care of us and after waiting 40 minutes for our food she took $10 off the bill. The ticket says Alexandra, but she goes by \"Ally\", so if you come in request her because she was really nice and knowledgeable about the restaurant. she remained cool, calm, and collected while we waited. she explained they had to let go a few kitchen staff members and that's why there was a wait. On the other hand, the red head at the bar was the one who ignored me while trying to order, so stay away from her. Their food was great, no complaints really. their iced latte was good after our server finally got it for me.",

    "text": "I have been here twice now, and have experienced sub-par service, and an overcooked omelet.  The first time I went to the restaurant, the place was no more than a couple weeks old. We had to wait for a few minutes to be seated, but that is to be expected, as it is a new establishment.  After being seated and waiting for about 10 minutes, we finally had a server come and introduce herself.  Since we had already sat there for 10 minutes, we were both ready to order, but right after we had placed our drink orders, the waitress just sped off, so we had to wait another 5 minutes. When the server came back, I had ordered an omelet with potatoes.  The food came out about 15 minutes later, and my omelet was burnt, while the potatoes were cold.  I waited for a few minutes, but our server was nowhere in site.  At this point, I had become impatient and just ate the food and chalked it up to it being a new place, and would come back a 2nd time to try it again.  About 2 weeks ago, we finally decided to go back, thinking all the hype should have died down, and we should be able to get some decent service and food.  I was wrong.  We got seated and waited about 10 minutes for a server... again.  This time, we made sure to order the food, and then the drinks.  I ordered the same thing as i did the last time- an omelet.  The food came out while I was in the restroom, so I didn't have a chance to see it while the server was there, but the omelet was burnt... again.  Omelets are supposed to have some yellow to it, but this thing was BROWN.  Anyways, I came back, waited for about 5 minutes, only to see our server playing with a dog on the patio.  This went on for another 3 or 4 minutes, and again, I became a little upset at the fact that we had sat there for so long with minimal service, so I started eating the omelet.  It was a good thing, because she didn't come back until our plates were cleared.  Horrible service, and sub-par food... again.  The atmosphere is really cool, and the location is great.  I love to sit outside and people watch, but I do like to eat a decent breakfast with some service more.  I understand this is the new trendy restaurant in Scottsdale, but its going to lose fast, if it doesn't start taking care of its customers.  There are plenty of other breakfast places in the area that have outstanding service, with better food.  I suggest you look for those places.",

Although our server was very kind and sweet, as well as most of the serving staff - We waited over an hour from the time we ordered until the food was on our table. I understand it's a busy Saturday morning but this was a travesty. I will never go back and will tell everyone I know to stay away. The food was average at best and I was upset the manager waited until we got our food to mention she was sorry and made up some pathetic excuse as to why it took so long. There is no excuse - accept the fact that you screwed up, tell your customer and offer to give a size-able or full discount, period. She did neither and I was clearly upset. My meal should've been free. This place is a disgrace. Zero stars",

When we finally did put our order in it took forever to actually get our food. The server blamed the kitchen staff, but when the food was delivered it wasn't even hot. I would call that a server issue not kitchen. The people at the table next to us ordered after we did and received their food at least 10 min before us. When our food was finally delivered we didn't have silverware so the food sat on our table for about 5 mins before they came back with utensils. After waiting almost an hour for food, this was unacceptable. The food itself was ok. I think we ate it all because we were starving by the time it came. With all the other breakfast places to choose from in Old Town, it's doubtful we'll be back here.",

The runner from the kitchen had to end up taking my order for a drink because Katie R was too busy talking up the hostess. During this time I saw the other waitress check on her table 3 times. Country fried steak was disgusting and dry, English muffin was cold. I have been here several times but this is the last, unfortunately. Management had failed to see any Yelps as I can tell. The internet is the forefront of your business, check local sources and maybe you wouldn't keep running into these same issues.",

Other than that I have no complaints ! Sometimes the service can be slow , but I've always had very friendly waitresses. I think this is one of the better places for breakfast in old town Scottsdale.

As I walk up to the hostess table, I had to get her attention because she was on her phone. Hostess 101, your phone shouldn't even be near you, you're getting paid to greet customers who come in. As soon as I got her attention I told her that I would like to place my name down for a table. Instead of asking what my name was and how many people were in my party, she said, no because your party has to all be here. Her tone was especially rude as there are other ways of saying no without sounding obnoxious.  The food was mediocre at best and took over half an hour to be served.",

We frequent a lot of the breakfast spots here in Scottsdale (Breakfast Club, Daily Dose, etc.), and this place doesn't stack up.  While the service (we had Sam recently, and she was awesome) and the ambience are very good, the food just lacks anything that wows you.  There are two things that we'd recommend.  First, the waffles with the seasonal berries and granola are good (the granola puts it over the top).  Second, the smoothies are pretty darn good.  This place is also great if you wanna bring your pooch(es), as they are very dog friendly, and everyone there seems to love dogs as much as we do. Beyond that, the omelets and other standard breakfast fare are okay at best.  We had a really bad experience with the Chorizo (steer clear!), which was gamey (my fiancee validated), and presented very lackluster on a side plate (I'll post the picture right after the review).  We've also tried the Huevos Rancheros, various omelets, and breakfast sandwiches, and they've all been sub par.  I hope that this kitchen gets it together, as this place shows a lot of promise, but this place unfortunately just doesn't stack up to the local competition.",

Unfortunately though, the oatmeal cold and it wasn't even served with milk. That was disappointing and I figured the whole pot must be that way in the kitchen so I ordered eggs Benedict, California style with veggies. I now have waited quite a while. The Benedict showed up and sure enough, it too was luke warm and so were the hash browns! It was also soggy. Are you kidding me? What are they doing in the kitchen? The man next to me told me he comes there a lot but had a bad Sunday experience himself with cold food. The server behind the bar was very apologetic, twice, and then a manager came and apologized. She did not charge me of course, and was nice enough to give me a gift card to return. I think I will give it to my friend and return to my favorite breakfast place, Breakfast Kitchen Bar in the Scottsdale Quarter. Food made from scratch, not prepackaged and a unique menu.  Everything I've ever had there is excellent!",

We waited only because the other person i was dining with was adamant we eat here to try something new. It was not worth the 25 min wait, and we were rewarded with poor service and bad food. Try the breakfast club instead for better food and a place that will let you sit at open tables.",

My boyfriend had the Eggs My Way, which was, once again, nothing special.  I also had an iced vanilla latte-- it wasn't anything great and, unfortunately, Starbucks would have been better. The regular coffee was really good, not sure what they're brewing, but it was smooth and I wish I got that instead of the iced latte.  We didn't have to wait for a table, so that was nice, but after a while a line did start forming by the front door.  Dogs are allowed on the side patio where there is a separate entrance, so that is pretty neat.  It's not bad, but it is just not incredible or amazingly awesome-- you won't be disappointed.",

People came and went whom arrived after me and were sat before me. I went to check the time and I was told another 25 minutes due to the kitchen being backed up. I understand what it means to be backed up but that is truly poor management and poor planning. My advice... If your kitchen is backed up stop sitting people. I had relatives in town who had time restriction, needless to say nobody got to eat. Very rude staff! I will never eat there again. Poor planning!",

He got the Friends with Bennies (lobster and crab) and I got the classic. Both were good. I got potatoes and he got hash browns, the hash browns were delicious but super buttery. They have a lot of good coffee drink options too (I want to try the orange chai). Our waitress was friendly and it's reasonably priced. I definitely want to go back and I hope this place sticks around because I feel like everything that goes into this building doesn't last :(. Oh yeah and I liked the set up how it was like open to the little patio, it made it feel beachy.

Out of habit, and preference, I always chose to sit at the counter and since the heat was already creeping up I sat inside as oppose to my second favorite location... The patio.  The indoor counter top faces N Scottsdale Rd. and offers a great view as well as A/C ( I'm still adapting to the heat)  I love the eclectic and artistic vibe that old town Scottsdale offers ... it is very much like Laguna's art walk area and a bit old town Pasadena.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy it was really hearty and delicious but more than the food I enjoyed my down-to-earth conversation with the bar/server she was such a sweetheart!  I stayed long after my meal and juice was finished just chatting it up and to be able to feel that welcomed and relaxed was completely appreciated!  A 5 star review for Morning Squeeze!",

The bar and outside seating is ideal for a lazy weekend breakfast, the servers are on point but the food comes to the table consistently cold.   I judge a place by the temperature of its toast and they can't get that right. We're here 2-3 times a month and not once has my toast been delivered hot or even warm. The foods great, but temperature is pretty spotty. We're constantly send food back to be warmed or asking for hot toast. Your a breakfast place, hot food should be in your DNA.   Here's some unsolicited advice. Instead of having 3-4 hostess just standing inside the door, have them running food out to tables. Hot food for everyone and I bet you can turn your tables quicker on a busy morning.",

Every slice tastes freshly-made and is toasted very well. The eggs are cooked expertly and while the fries and breakfast potatoes don't look like much, they pack big flavor into them.   The wait-staff has always been upbeat, particularly Cami. They have added $2.00 mimosas on the weekdays, which is made with fresh-squeezed orange juice. A definite recommend for both breakfast and lunch (where their grilled chicken sandwich is to die for).   My big complaint comes from the last trip there, where they started cleaning the grill during our meal. Some pretty bad odors wafted through the restaurant as a result (and they were seating new guests to boot, it's not like we were there past closing time). It's small mistakes like that which keeps the ever-elusive fifth star from being awarded.  The location is right on Scottsdale Road and parking is very difficult. Be prepared to walk a bit to make it to the restaurant.",

First thing i ordered was a bloody mary because i saw someone with one (monkey see monkey do) and the bacon sticking out of it looked great!  So when i finally got mine, it had no bacon.. no celery either.. just an olive, a lime, and a lemon.. and it was super bright red.  The taste was not too bad, but definitely not what i had expected, i asked about it, and the server said i should have ordered a \"bacon bloody mary\" . oh well, my bad right?  So i did so for my second, and it was pretty good, except the bacon was old, like what you would find at the last 10 minutes of a bloody mary bar.   To eat, i ordered the chicken fried steak/hashbrowns/something stack, it sounded EPIC! like something from Hash House A GO GO!! But.. when it came, it was lacking, well.. everything, it looked sloppily put together, and was near flavorless.  I am so glad that they had a couple different hot sauces at every table, they are gonna need it.",

When we brought up our concerns to the manager, after only a few bites, he made excuses instead of simply apologizing and replacing. Eventually, he said he would take care of it. Then the server dropped the check off with the steak still included. When I questioned that fact, her response was \"yeah, I need to have my manager take care of that.\"  Girl, don't give me a check you know is wrong and hope I just pay it.   Overall, bad experience. Won't be going back to this place as there are many other great breakfast options in old town.",

    "text": "I can definitely understand why this place only has 3 stars. Myself and 3 gal pals came for the first time this morning to place to go orders and were really let down by the level of service especially from the manager. I ordered a strawberry smoothie (add banana) and a side of bacon. (I'm 6 months pregnant and have learned not to argue with my cravings) The bacon of course was fine, who messes up bacon? However, the strawberry smoothie was an abomination. It was made from some form of disgustingly sweet pre-mix that has no business being in their restaurant and had not been mixed thoroughly either. I informed the host of my dislike for the smoothie and asked if it could be remade with fruit and ice only. She came back and informed me the only fruit they have is bananas, did I want that. You can't possibly think I believe that there is no fresh fruit anywhere in this restaurant aside from bananas?! And no I sure as hell do not want a banana smoothie.   She said that she would go get a manager for a price adjustment, and did so. The manager (a woman who I did not meet) came out, did something at the register, and then went about her merry way back to the kitchen. What kind of half ass manager doesn't apologize to the customer or even speak at all? My mind is at a loss for how in the world this woman became a manager unless her wait staff has the misfortune of having her as a owner in which case I could understand. Some people buy titles, others earn it. If she earned it I'd be flabbergasted.  We went to the restaurant at 7:45 am on Friday, April 29th. The \"manager\" was a shorter woman with brown wavy/curly hair.",

    "text": "29MAR  10:00am I am torn on how to rate, so let me start like this: Our service was excellent.  Hostess greeted us very friendly and sat us right away.  Lucky timing because there was a wait when we left.  Our server Alex was awesome.  She was very friendly, checked on food as the kitchen was slow without having to ask, kept water filled without asking, was prompt and attentive, suggested another round of bloodies when the first was gone.  All in all she was excellent, and I would recommend anyone ask for her.  Service = 5 stars Food was excellent, even though the monte cristo was slightly overdone.  Wife had a build your own breakfast sandwich on a croissant that she said was outstanding.  She raved about the garlic fries, and was very happy with the food.  5 Bloodies, sammy, monte, side bacon - Bill total $76.37.  Not your average cheap breakfast for 2.  Food = 4 stars (monte cristo)  Here is where I am struggling.  This restaurant was DIRTY.  The table was \"clean\" (just don't moved the salt and pepper), but the booth seats were anything but.  I realized this is the case after watching the busser.  He simply wipes off the table- Does not move the salt/pepper/condiments - wipes around them, and pushes everything off the edge of the table, onto chairs and the floor.  No bother to wipe off the chairs or booth seats.  This explains the booth cleanliness.  Add to this, where we sat, there was a shelf that ran along the back of the booths, right at the top edge of the booths.  Looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a month.  You could see where people had mistakenly ran their arms or hands along it.  BIG MISTAKE as you would immediately need to go wash them.  Also, on the wall above us was a vase that had lemons and limes.  It too was covered in dirt and dust.  all I can say here is At least our silverware, plates, and and glasses were clean!  Cleanliness - 0 stars  The real icing on the cake was the manager.  I believe I was told her name is Leslie.  She was expediting/running food.  When she brought out ours, she auctioned it off.  This is a big pet peeve of mine at any restaurant.  She dropped off the food and turned around and walked away.  Either she couldn't carry everything, or she forgot the fries and bacon, because a couple minutes later she appeared with the missing items.  Again just dropped the plates and walked off.  No bother to ask if she could get us anything else.  No smile.  No \"Enjoy\".  Nothing.  Thank goodness our server Alex appeared right away as we needed a couple things - ketchup, jelly (this was listed on the menu as coming with the monte cristo, so this was not a special request - Leslie just missed it), etc.  We were seated in a place (table 53) I could look right down the food line where Leslie was expoing.  She never smiled.  Never said please or thank you.  I watched her run food to several tables.  Sure enough, she just auctions stuff off and walks away.  One table actually said \"excuse me\", then again quite loudly, \"excuse me\" to which she turned around and said \"Yes?\"  They asked for hot sauce.  You could tell by the look on her face she was irritated.  She goes and gets it, drops it off and walks off.  No \"anything else?\" or \"Enjoy you food\". Nothing.  This has to be one of the WORST examples of leading by example, and how to treat customers.  How this woman is employed in a service capacity is beyond me.   I was actually going to ask to speak to a manager, about the cleanliness, our awesome server Alex, and the food runner.  To my dismay, Alex told us leslie was the manager when I asked.   Oh well.   0 stars  This is an excellent opportunity for the owner to do some THOROUGH coaching and teaching with the bussers, and with Leslie.  People come to a restaurant for food.  They do or don't come back for a myriad of other reasons.  I would return, only after a thorough cleaning, on a day that Alex was working and Leslie was not.",

Order a $10.25 Bloody Mary with coronita that was mostly tomato juice. Before I even ordered my food I specifically asked if I wanted the Cross Fit but wanted a protein pancake if I can substitute the toast for one. You can probably guess what kind of pancake came when my food arrived.(not the protein) After all that I decided to play it safe and order a beer. There's no way you can get that wrong right? My IPA comes with a \"bottled date and enjoy by date\" bottled 04/2016 and 07/2016. No biggie I can see how a server or bar tender might not notice that. So I take it up to the bar and show the bar tender the date and she looks at it and says \"that's 2018\" I laughed and walked away. Being a bar tender or anyone with common sense knows bottled beer isn't water and wouldn't be good TWO YEARS from now. And the picture I took clearly shows the 2016 date it was bottled and the 2016 date it's good by is the same. Get employees that enjoy working on a Saturday morning.",

Luckily, we live and work in a resort community, so we can go here all the time.  Morning Squeeze specializes in breakfast and lunch. It is brightly decorated with colorful booths inside, a square bar that can be accessed from the inside or from the dog friendly patio. The wait staff are very friendly and are willing to answer all of your questions about the menu, but be nice, they deal with enough jerks who are either hungover or still drunk from the night before in Scottsdale.  I've tried both breakfast and lunch items so far and found everything to be delicious although my coworker noted that her crab cakes could be a little crisper. My favorite so far are the Eggs Benedict.  Morning Squeeze also prides itself on a large selection of Bloody Mary's for those who want a kick start to the day.  If you like to eat out for breakfast this is definitely a place to add to the regular rotation.",

The only thing I didn't like was that they charge extra to substitute fruit for toast. That wasn't mentioned on the menu, nor did our server ask if that was okay. I hate being punished for eating healthy.",

Misters hover in the overhang for when misters are necessary to keep patrons chill.  Servers are in track shoes and pastel sports gear.  Orders do come out of the kitchen quickly, but come on - Do we really need that visual reminder of how that all happens?   I had a pulpy orange juice - delicious.  And a guilty short stack. Also delicicous.  But fair warning.  Food should be cooked, not ready to be spit out.  The sausage links were pink, warm, and as far as I could tell, closer to raw than cooked.  Without prompting, the server took them off the table as well as off the check.     Gotta run.  Hope to see you here again soon.",

Definitely tell that it was fresh and just the right sweetness to start the morning.   She was also really knowledgable of the menu, making a few suggestions and shaving the local favorites.   I ordered the Biscuits and gravy with the sides eggs (scrambled). The eggs were a bit over cooked but nothing terrible. The b&w were definitely a great choice! The gravy has some sausage bits and a little spice but it's honestly more of an after taste of spice than that immediate peppery taste a lot of gravies have.   The only reason for the -1 star: it did take a little longer than expected for the food to come out.   Overall though, glad I made the stop and would enjoy trying some other local favorites next time.",

    "text": "Absolutely love this place, my wife and I come here at least once a week. The breakfast rush is usually pretty crazy so we come after around 11am, we like to eat breakfast a lot later than others. The best seat in the house in my opinion is in the back booths where you get a lot of natural light and a great view of the street, plus the air conditioning is great, and much needed here in Old Town during the summer months.  The bartenders are also very nice and quick when making drinks, and are always up for conversation. Our favorite server is Chris, he served us today at 1230 and was very attentive! He took our order down and read it back to us so it was 100% accurate. He also checked in with us after the first bite to make sure everything was great. If you come here see if Chris is working, he'll take care of you and make sure you get an amazing dining experience.  Now let's talk food, I've had a lot of food on this menu and all of it is exceptional. The breakfast tacos are a must, and so are their protein pancakes with peanut butter on the side. My wife gets the \"Eggs My Way\" plate and it's got all the essentials for a hearty breakfast. If you're coming in for lunch grab the Caesar wrap and fries, delicious.  If you're visiting in the area and are craving breakfast or a great healthy lunch, this is the spot! Thanks again Chris and Morning Squeeze for a great experience every week, we'll be back soon!

Ciabatta bun for chicken pesto sandwich was overpowering (too big for the skinny piece of grilled chicken)  to say the least.  French toast photos looked good on the website, but, when it was finally served...it was soggy and cold.  Eggs Benedict was the worst I ever had...it tasted like I was eating a runny yolk; should be removed from the menu...really!   Would I ever go back?  Hell no.   I think the kitchen staff needs to either coordinate better on timing OR the food needs to be delivered when it's hot.  Probably the worst breakfast experience I can recall.  Management/Owners should try eating the food being served.  BIG disappointment in an area that could use a good breakfast/lunch spot.  Does not live up to the reviews they've received on yelp.",

I asked her a question about one of their French toast items. She literally said they had taken off a few different variations of this awesome breakfast food \"because it tasted so bad\" - huge red flag...whenever a breakfast place can't do Challah French toast...something is up. I settled for the Nutella pancakes and it was these measly 2 pancakes that sort've tasted like Nutella with a huge dollop of whatever topping they put on for a spread. Very underwhelming. As for the coffee, since it was my first time there I just opted for Starbucks afterward. Sad to say that that experience was a lot better than this.",

I don't know if it's the lack of .25 cent mimosas or maybe the portions but I was definitely turned off and probably (sadly ) won't be back.  I ordered the Acai bowl which was amazing and why I'm giving 3 stars.  The avocado toast was so mediocre I had to send it back. There's no way I'm paying $7 for a sliced avocado ( I don't think it was even one whole avocado) , some Italian dressing on top and 2 pieces of over toasted dry sourdough.  The manager was nice to take it off my check. My guest got an omelette but the portions have changed and I was embarrassed that I suggested this place.  I spoke so high of it and it disappointed. The service was just different and not as friendly as it used to be and the whole vibe was just down.  Maybe there was a management change or a decision to cut back but to me not the right choice for a Scottsdale daytime favorite of mine. Hopefully they will read some of these reviews and take notes on some of the not so positive changes.",

It was always satisfying till the change. As anyone who has taken a culinary course understands how the proportionality of the toppings to the bread is key in creating a sandwich, that aspect is completely overlooked here. Indicating the person in charge of the kitchen has never had the required experience in the culinary area or has had a lousy one.",

Understandably, it was a busy Saturday so waiting to get sat was not an issue. It's after we were sat that wasn't that great. We ordered our food within 15 minutes of getting sat but didn't receive our food for an entire hour. We were seconds away from putting cash on the table for the drinks and just leaving. Our server did not come over once to reassure us that the food was even being made or on its way. I had to stop her in passing and ask what the hold up was an hour later. When the food did arrive it was cold and half of my husband's meal was still missing. Very disappointed in the productivity.  And lastly, Morning Squeeze must be in dire need to save money because they traded out basic glass plates to plastic flimsy plates that look like something of a middle school cafeteria.. not quality at all.. and they traded out their nice big white mugs for itty bitty Ikea mugs.. like why? Save your money and walk across the street to the Breakfast Club where its better to wait the extra 15 Min and get good quality everything.",

When brought back my eggs were runny and the biscuits still hard. They offered to try a third time however my husband had already finished his. I expected better.

She had the hangover bowl, a signature dish, and it was served without most of the things in it. When she brought this up to the server, the server brought a side of black beans for her to put in it, which were supposed to be included. It was also not warm. The server noticed that this was mostly uneaten when we asked for the check and offered to take it off, though, which was nice.   I had the build your own breakfast sandwich. Pretzel bun with egg, cheese, and I added spinach and avocado. No spinach, also not warm, and the avocado was brown. The bun was way too greasy. It was served with fruit, which had a hair in the bowl. We brought this up to the server, and she brought a new bowl of fruit, most of which was mushy.   We ordered a bloody mary and a hibiscus orange juice. Juice was incredibly sweet, both drinks were kind of warm. Overall, we left feeling very hungry and disappointed.",

We thought right away this is going to be our new spot. Then it all happened..... the bartender was the worst one I've had. I use to own bars so I know the difference. We had to ask her several times for refills of water even when she saw our glasses empty but yet filled the persons up right next to us. Three other tables who came in 20 mins after received there food before us. We asked the bartender about this and she was rude. Our food came and the tomatoes were mushy and soggy. My dish wasn't even the right one. The bartender took it and didn't apologize or even ask what I would like to make this right. Instead she stammered off mad.     We felt uncomfortable and not welcomed. At this point we were not going to come back. Long story short, we asked for the manager. She came out and was as professional as one should and could be. That is what I expected from this establishment. She was gracious and apologetic. She then gave me a new fresh meal made right and a gift card to come back. Because of her professionalism we will come back and give it another try! Thank you to the two front desk hostesses for being so nice when we came in and after!  Update: My client ( a different one) and I came in after a training sesh to try it out again. Everyone was nice, professional and the new bartender was a doll! Food was delicious! I'm so glad we gave it another try! New spot for us now;)",

The service was ok, right when I got antsy our coffee finally arrived.  Our waitress was courteous, but she was never around to ask the normal questions about the food.  We pretty much were left alone, I noticed at the end she was also working on the north patio which tells me why our service was ok, Morning Squeeze doesn't have enough servers to be efficient and provide that extra mmmphh for the dining experience.  Now to the food, my girlfriend ordered the breakfast tacos and they were pretty good, but not popping.  I ordered the Crossfit with pulled pork, pretty good stuff. Wherein layeth the problem with the kitchen, my egg scramble was steaming when I got it, but my hash browns were damn cold.  So they got done fast and weren't under a heat lamp and just sat.  Then we shared a nutella and banana crepe...it was good, but it was not a crepe.  Crepes are thin, this was just a thinner pancake and, and then it stated on the menu we can put any topping on it...but it was add any topping.  I've paid ten dollars for a crepe before and that wasn't a ten dollar crepe.    As I said, food was good, service just made it, cold hash browns annoyed me and I can see why there are so many poor reviews.",

Come on Mr Restaurant owner you know people love the swine, so stop trying to save and give up the meaty crispy bacon we deserve.   On a positive note they have girls in skimpy outfits serving your needs. So I had that going for me and last but not least the OJ is fresh squeezed and yummy.

    "text": "Stopped by on a Sunday morning at 6:30 hoping to beat the Sunday Funday crowd, but opening was delayed half an hour due to some overnight break in or something or other.  There were cops, and I wasn't asking for details because honestly I didn't care to ask.  But either way, not their fault someone broke in and caused a ruckus or whatever it was.  There were two different outdoor patio areas, and I'm going to assume that both are dog friendly.  I walked in the patio thats parallel to the main road so I could sit at the bar with my little homie.  I ordered a few mimosas, the classic bene, and a side of toast for myself.  Mimosas weren't bad, a bottomless or carafe option would be nice though.  Classic bene came with a side of hashbrowns and an orange slice.  Bene was pretty good, not amazing, but pretty good, and decently priced.  Hashbrowns I thought were a little on the undercooked side.  And toast is toast, although I don't think it came buttered.  But didn't matter to me, I like toast with my bene so I can soak up all the gooey protein/cholesterol goo mixed with the leftover hollandaise drenched in hot sauce.  For my little homie, I ordered him the Chow Hound Scramble.  And he didn't like it.  But then again, he is, by far, the pickiest puppy you will ever meet.  It was like a mix of plain scrambled eggs, cheese, and chicken.  Eventually I picked out all the chicken bits by hand and he happily wolfed them down.  Service: It was a little slow, but it was brunch on Sunday Funday.  I sat at the bar so all my orders went through the bartender.  I didn't catch her name, but she was nice, and I thought the service was pretty good overall despite some of the negative reviews you'll find here.  Wait for food was about 15-20 minutes, even though I was here right when they opened.  Along with the 20+ other people who were there with me due to the delayed opening.    Things that could have been better:  the chow scramble came in a little styrofoam bowl, and I would assume the other options for furry friends come in the same.  I was a little worried my little homie would bite off a chunk of the bowl and swallow it down.  Lucky for me, he only ate the chicken bits once I pulled them out and fed him by hand.  Also, they could have offered a water bowl for the little guy, but I wasn't too concerned, it's a 5 minute walk and he wasn't thirsty anyway.  And the hashbrown thing, just slightly undercooked.    Overall: 3.5 rounded up to 4, because all the servers were super nice and were super friendly.  Probably because my puppy is cuter than your puppy.  My little homie got much love.  I didn't see this place listed as dog friendly, but it is very much so.   One more bit of randomness: they have the little hook things under the bar and under tables, which was nice to tie off the little homie's leash.  And I suppose you could hang a purse or backpack or whatever on the hooks if you really wanted to.",

That and a brunch spot that would meet the needs of some of my favorite ladies (mimosas, moderate prices, deliciousness). This place fit the bill to perfection.   It was a fantastic day for patio dining and the service was splendid. We had a lot of catching up to do and the server was ever so patient while we did. She also helped us work out the best combination to satisfy all of our day drinking desires and breakfast/lunch cravings. The decor of the space was darling and was situated in an ideal locale for people watching. The only downside for me might have been the early closing time, as I could of used just one more hour to take it all in:) That aside, it was a brunch for the books. Yum.",

Of the many places we have eaten in Old Town Scottsdale, this is one we keep going back to. Everything I have had there has been really good, but one of my very top favorites is their Scottsdale's Finest Hash. It's different. It's delicious. It may well be the finest, a fair claim on their part.  Yes, we're fans!",

We were sat, then un-sat because the hostesses were all on their own agenda. Took 20 minutes to get sat. Got sat & waited about 30 minutes to get a water. (Mind you, it's 12 now and we got there at 10:45) it's dead. Our food takes forever to come out. Missing what we wanted & then the manager (I assume) comes over and says she will discount our meal for taking so long. Thank you for the discount of $4. It's almost embarrassing to think that's how you guys take care of your customers. Not to mention our server comes by and says your kitchen messes up on the daily here. Very disappointed to say the least. We drove out from Gilbert to eat here- waste of gas, time and money. At least now we know to never make the drive out here again.",

    "text": "This experience at Morning Squeeze went from \"ok\" to \"EXTREMELY AWFUL\" within a matter of minutes! I stopped in for brunch a few weeks ago hoping to cure my taste buds with a hearty meal and enjoy the sunday funday setting.   Our waitress was resourceful about the menu, full of energy, and brought the food out within a reasonable amount of time. At that particular moment, with great service, I just knew things couldn't get any better than they already were. Unfortunately I was correct...they got worst.   After paying out the tab and leaving the table....I walk out to realize my wallet is still inside on the table. Within less than \"2 minutes\" of being outside of the restaurant near the front door, I went back inside to find my wallet gone.   The employee who cleaned our table, whom also had a history of being accused (info from server) of stealing things had immediately disappeared. I asked for them to review the security system, but was told they didn't have any cameras in their restaurant. Surprising to hear being in their location..you would think they had some type of monitors in place.   Not only was my wallet stolen within minutes, but there was also not one type of acknowledgement of the situation from the general manager who was on site the entire time. She walked passed me several times...no eye contact, smiles, or any type of addressing what just happened. The crazy part is they \"allegedly\" couldn't find the bus boys phone number & personal information.   If you want an incompetent staff who shows up for a daily paycheck and looks the other way when things go wrong, this is your place.",

I normally sit at the bar here and the bartenders/servers are attentive to their guests, while making drinks for the restaurant. They always make sure we have what we need, and are almost always friendly. This is a hard task to accomplish especially when I'm sure they are busy from open to close during spring training.  I took off half a star because I think they could have either a couple more staff on in certain places, and offer pagers for the longer wait days so we can walk around the area while waiting.",

One on the booth near the wall and the other on the table a little below the booth. It's kind of weird and we didn't really get to talk much together.

We waited at first for about 15 minutes before the waitress said our order was 'on they way'. She said the same thing a few more times for the next 30 mins before we decided to just leave.  As we left, I spoke to the hostess and explained that we could no longer wait. I asked her if she wanted to me to pay for our drinks- a coffee and and orange juice. She said 'no' and that she was 'sorry'.  But as we left, and walked across the street, the waitress screamed out to us that we didn't pay our bill and ran across the street to us - bill in hand. We explained that hostess said out bill was taken care of. She argued with us that the hostess was 'not the boss'. We offered to walk back before she grudgingly accepted that we were dissatisfied with our experience. Unbelievable. We won't return.

It's got a open space, lot of light, and bright colors, which I always enjoy.   I ordered the Friends with Bennies (or Bennies with Friends, whatever). It was an eggs benedict with shrimp and lobster, with hash browns and a couple slices of fruit. I think it came out to about $14, before tax. The food was all right, though I thought the eggs were overdone (which, next time, I would just order as poached over easy. Simple fix).  The portions are small. In my case, I'm not sure if that's a bad thing, because I never finish my food (and cleared my plate at Morning Squeeze), but I could see others being disappointed. I guess I would have liked a bit more for $14, but since I was having lobster with my breakfast, so should I complain? Not really.  I have one peeve about Morning Squeeze (and it is nit-picky, I'm aware) and that was that the hostess that sat us down was wearing a see through blouse with a black bra. Typically, this type of styling doesn't bother me in the least, but it's not what I am looking for at 9:30 for breakfast on a weekday. Does this make me a 25-year-old fuddy duddy? Maybe.  In closing, I'd be game to try Morning Squeeze again, but I didn't experience a \"Wow!\" factor my first time in.   Hope this helps, happy eating!",

    "text": "Let me start this review by saying one star is being generous. Maybe it was because it was a slow Tuesday, but all of the staff minus the bartender and hostess looked miserable and stressed, including our own server, who did not take the time to introduce herself and quickly left without any waters or anything.   Now, I am usually very understanding of restaurant  hardships as I myself work in a breakfast joint. But MS was pretty dead and only a couple of other people around, and our food took 31 minutes for a mere cremebrulee pancakes and a breakfast sandwich.   The food itself was ATROCIOUS. We got two burnt pancakes that looked slapped down on the plate in a hurry, a surprise given how long it took to get. My sandwich was just an egg and some avocado between a croissant, that honestly tastes like I could have made it myself in less time and with a better attitude. Given the smaller portions and less than mediocre food, the time took was ridiculous and better spent at a Juliobertos.   Our server than just left the check folded without saying anything and we never got a good bye or anything else. We were pretty glad to leave and I've never wanted to get out of a place faster! I don't know what it is about the decor, the service, or the food but this place is missing a lot of its potential.   The time it took to get us our food could be better used to train all the members of the establishment to cook better, serve better and be better in general.",

Had food brought to us that wasn't even ours it was for a table that got there after us. Mind you we have been waiting for 30 mins now. Then we saw 2-3 tables come in eat and leave still had no food. Then finally the waitress came to tell us it was really busy sorry for the wait. So after 50! Minutes we finally got our food and it was ICE COLD!!! I normally never send food back or make a sense but this is just not okay! Then when we told our waitress about the situation she said she would have the manager come over and talk to us we proceeded to wait another 10! Minutes for the manager she NEVER came so we told our waitress that we weren't going to pay and wanted to leave and how this is totally unacceptable (mind you I work in the industry ). Horrible horrible horrible. I don't even want to give one star",

Would have to place it in my top 5 for this category when looking for a great breakfast place in old town.    Staff is quick and responsive especially when your food comes out wrong or contrary to your liking.  This has never happened to me here personally but I have seen it happen to others around me each time I have been here and it is the reason this review is not a 5 star.  Personally I think they just need a better order system or another cook in the back but still a must try despite their shortcomings with orders.  Also, if you plan on coming here during peak breakfast hours on a weekend, forget it!  You will wait for at least a half hour.  But worth it if you have the time.",

    "text": "One of the worst breakfast experiences ever!     The service was extremely slow and my food came out rubbery and cold. But that probably had something to do with the fact that it sat up on the counter for five minutes... Which we watched happen. Not only did several servers walk by our food with the ticket ready and keep walking but so did the manager, twice!  Finally, since we were in a rush we went and found the server standing at the hostess stand and told her our food was ready.  My friends French toast was cold so she had to send it back. Unfortunately, I had some place to be so I just didn't eat my food, I sent it back. My eggs were rubbery and brown and my hashbrowns (which I ordered extra crispy) were cold and not crispy.  The manager was a jerk, when we complained he walked over and said \"you guys are complaining already ha ha Ha...\" . He was unprofessional, never came over and apologized, and we watched him touch his face at least 10 times while he was expediting food. Ewww! He should not be running a restaurant, this is the reason this place is a disaster and gets terrible reviews on yelp. Luckily all was not lost because I was in good company!   My advice, wait the extra time for the breakfast club or go to McDonald's you have a way better experience either way.",

Just one apology but no drink on the house or anything to compensate. Then the lady that clean the glass door sprayed us with Windex by accident. WTF!?

It was fine , the weather was nice and we were hungry. Then we waited, waited, and waited. The next group of people came over and sat down. Not 5 mins later they got a service!!! Not to mention, the waitress was very friendly with them. Then the waitress finally came over to us. She was short and not friendly.  So we ordered our food. I ordered steak and eggs.  Medium rare for steak. After about, what seemed like, 30 mins the food came but instead of a medium rare,  my steak was well. She did offer to take it back but we didn't feel like waiting for , what seemed like, another half hour. We finished our food and left. Never going back again.",

Fruit was good although kind of warm and English muffin was large-not bad but the bottom was hard as a rock.
