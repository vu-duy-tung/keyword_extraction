It's definitely worth a trip, especially during lunch when they serve dim sum.  C-Fu  not only has the standard menu items such as Sweet and Sour Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Chow Mein, but they also have some unique items such as Shark Fin Soup, several duck and ostrich dishes, and sea cucumber dishes.  Above average taste coupled with good dim sum gives C-Fu an above average rating of four stars.",

I went back for the pork wonton soup.  I added a bit of soy sauce and it was good.  It wasn't the best I ever had but it was good.  Also the staff was HUGE in making up for my last visit.  That is a plus.    10 minutes and  the soup was ready and waiting.  It was hot and good.  I added the soy sauce to add a bit of salty which I like.  It was good.  The pork was fattier than I've had elsewhere but it was good otherwise.  The food was decent and the staff was cool.    Now, I have not tried the in house dim sum.  As it was I have to give props for a great manager.  The duck soup is normally served with bones, according to the manager.  Not my thing but I was glad he explained it.  Tradition can be big even if it is not to my tastes.  I guess that is a good heads up to potential customers.    It was fair goods and very nice service.  If it was less fatty, they would have gotten a 4 but they get a 4 for service and a 2 for chow this time around.  I am not shy about my review.  I give what I get.  If they impress me better next time, I will post so.    However as it was, fair food and great service.  3 out of 5 for now.  Thanks to the staff for being huge and I got fed and was fairly pleased with the chow.  Not wowed but pleased.",

I am delighted to report I have been back to C-fu a couple of times in the last 6 months simply because compared to the rest out there in my local area this is the best choice.  We found that the food has gotten back to what it used to be, along with the selection of items and the service.  There are many of the regular dim sum items along with some interesting tid bits.  The food has been warm or better which is a far cry from the cold it was for a while there.  We went for our tradition Xmas dinner and unfortuantely they did NOT have their act together!  The owner was running around like a chicken with his head cut off.  There was noone to fill water, tea etc.... and the selections were not as quick as normal.  I come here each year for Xmas and usually the service is better....they know to expect the Xmas crowd but I am guessing they were very short handed.  I am glad I decied to give it another shot and will be returning.  My suggestion is to wait until 11:30 or so before going on a Sunday to get the best and freshest selections.  So go..... experience and enjoy!  Bon Appetite'",

I ordered a standard portion of the Spice Hot & Sour Soup--it arrived very hot temperature wise and was kind of bland. As I was on the fourth spoon full, our main course arrived. One order of Mongolian Beef which arrived warm to hot and one order of Orange Chicken that arrived warmish at best. Seems the whole order was done at once with the main dishes left inside the kitchen and NOT kept hot. Since the main dishes arrived, I stop consuming the soup as I figured the main dishes would get cooled off. I was wrong as they were already cooled off. Took all the leftovers home to see if they would be better heated up. Sometimes it just doesn't pay to bring this issue up to the manager. I've done this before as they act as if they don't understand. If you like cooled off hot items, this is the place for you!",

I was pretty embarrassed--brought some co-workers here for their first dim sum experience ever and I ended up apologizing for how bad the food was. They ended up ordering regular lunch entrees after trying their first couple dim sum items (I could have died of embarassment).  Siumai were cold and hard as rocks, ha gao very dry and chewy-skinned, charsiubao filling was odd-tasting, etc...we came at about 1230 so it wasn't off-peak lunch hours or anything. The selection of dim sum was dismal overall as well.   So for regular entrees, this place is ok. But if you're looking for dim sum, check out China King or Phoenix Palace just a few blocks away.",

I don't know if it is or isn't in the top 10 but conceding for the sake of discussion that it is I'm not sure what that says about Chinese food in the Phoenix area.  Since it was our first time here we ordered simple and perhaps overly obvious choices.  We started with hot and sour soup followed up with egg rolls, crab puffs and fried shrimp.  Soup was good.  Crab puff was actually had a crab like substance in it that you could taste over the cream cheese.  The shrimp was ok, but cold.  The egg roll was ok.  The bad thing about the crab puff and egg roll was that the grease they were fried in was very old and discolored the wonton wrappers.  Main course was beef and green beans, sweet and sour pork and fried rice.  The fried rice was good.  Beef and beans were good although the beef was a bit on the chewy side.  The sweet and sour pork was sweet and sour pork...what can you say.  Again, since the sweet and sour pork was deep fried it was cooked in the same old oil mentioned above.    All in all it was ok, but they really need to change/clean their oil.",

I think if I had a choice in the menu I would've enjoyed the food more and given it 4 stars. So I'm really only evaluating the banquet experience.  The room is spacious, servers were friendly (although some seemed clueless and talked very loudly while the presentation was going on), the decorations on stage are terrible and cheesy, the sound system kept giving feedback while people were speaking.  As for the food, I really enjoyed the seafood dishes, the chicken dishes were just kind of meh. The stand out for the night was the sesame balls they served for dessert.  I would come back here again, as the reviews for dim sum all seem favorable. For a Phoenix-area Chinese restaurant it's pretty good, but in general for a Chinese restuarant it's just about average.",

When a 6 year old tells you that his orange chicken is bland, something is wrong. I tasted it and he was right. My 3 year old granddaughter had the chicken fried rice. She ate a lot of it (she is picky so wouldn't try any of the other food at the table). I tasted it and it was quite good. I had the Mongolian Beef--excellent flavor, slightly spicy, and the beef was very tender. My daughter had the garlic chicken and rice. It was OK, but I noticed that she ate very little of it. Service was good. The room was nicely decorated. We had to park quite far from the door. Lunch and beverages for 2 adults and 2 children came to $53.04 before the tip. I noticed that most dishes were $9 and up.",

    "text": "My favorite dimsum restaurant!  I lived in Hong Kong for 8years and know what real Chinese/dimsum restaurants are.   Although we are not Chinese, we do dimsum on Sundays. So when we moved to Phoenix from Miami, we tried different dimsum places in Phoenix area.  We picked up some local Chinese news papers from a Chinese grocery store and tried the restaurants advertised on it. (written in Chinese, so we assumed they are authentic).   We went to Phoenix Palace, Golden Buddha, Mekong Palace, China King and C-Fu and concluded C-Fu offers the best dimsum.  Our criteria; 1. Variety 2. Taste 3. Freshness 4. Service 5. Price  Phoenix Palace might be the second best. They are as good as C-Fu in variety, taste and freshness, followed by China King whose variety is not high. Golden Buddha is the last. Golden Budda is not Cantonese restaurant anyway.   Staff are all nice at C-Fu and dishes categorized as \"A\" and \"B\" are all $2.28 which seem to include most of steamed dishes except expensive ones like shark fin dumplings. We normally spend $25-30 for two including tip.  C-Fu beats all the other places for the super flaky and tasty egg tarts. This is another reason we love C-Fu.",

I had called ahead for reservations as I wanted to be sure they could accommodate all 12 of us at one table.  No problem, the table was ready when we arrived.  Having a lazy Susan as the center of the table, makes it easy to distribute the food.  The various carts filled with goodies are continuously circling the room so you can pace your eating and select the things that appeal to you.  All of the food was well prepared and met or exceeded our expectations.  If there is a negative its that with several carts all with different varieties of food, there is too little time between the carts to select and eat before the next cart is there.  All of us enjoyed the experience and several were surprise at how reasonably priced the meal was. Definitely a fun meal.",

The prices have gone up while the selection had gone down. I only saw one full cart the whole time. One poor server pushed around a cart of the same eight items the whole time I was there - including a sad dish of cold clams.  The gai lan was still delicious but the steamed char sui buns were nowhere to be seen. Since this was my friends' favorite dish, she was left disappointed. The baked buns are now larger but contain less pork.  For what you pay for three sugar cane shrimp balls, you'd think they would be served hot, or warm, or anything but cold. I asked for the haupia (coconut pudding), I wondered why they were now cutting it in wedges. What I was served was a sour milk spongy dessert.   The new owner hovered, and prodded his employees along, which was a bit distracting. The chair covers look nice but that's definitely not the improvement you hope to find.",

They're the only one of the three who have staff who are courteous and make the effort to speak to you in English.  However, food-wise they're more or less on par.  The dishes at C-Fu sometimes look re-heated, but that might be because I'm not a morning person and don't make it in til 1PM or so.  But it's still pretty damn good.  Great Wall has really good barbecue pork buns, but are always jam-packed on any given day, so be prepared to wait outside for about 15 minutes for your number to be called - keeping in mind that 15 minutes in the summer heat feels like an eternity.  Phoenix Palace has pretty good egg tarts, but can get pretty crowded too and have some rather rude waiters.  So if you wanna try dim sum, I'd recommend trying out all three to try their best dishes.  If you don't want to have the experience ruin your day, go to C-Fu.",

Sadly, C-Fu is still terrible. I go by myself once in a while hoping for better news, my family won't go with me - no good news to report.   The other places are better.  But we concluded that Phoenix does not have its dim sum act together. Seattle, San Francisco, New York, even Minneapolis has good dim sum (Chicago not so much).

But after this year, I feel we will not be going back. We came in and got a table pretty quick. However, I had to go to the bathroom. Yuk. Two stalls were out of order and I had to scavenge for toilet paper around the unkept restroom. Bad start to the evening.   So we are waiting for the lion dancers. And soon they came. But they were just sitting there. What were they waiting for? No biggie. We ordered and the food was on its way. But we waited. And waited. And waited. I was hoping for something to happen. Food? Lion dancing? What would come first? A cart full of ice water! Yay.  So then the lion dancers started to stir. Some kids were playing with their equipment. Cute. The dancers were very nice to them and let them explore the lions and take pics and bang on the drums. Then finally they would start. Two lions go to the front. No food yet, but this should be cool.   Then the rudest thing I ever saw happened. The guy who was pushing the water cart runs over to the drummer lady, demands her drumsticks (I distinctly heard her say \"no\") then takes them from her and starts drumming. The people in the lions peeked out wondering what the heck was going on. This was NOT part of the show apparently. Then I see the lion guys doing a ton of hand gestures to the drummer. And this poor girl is just shrugging her shoulders and pointing to the rude older bully man drumming as loud as he can. Wow. Finally he stopped and gave the sticks back to the drummer and marches off. WTF? At least the kids were polite enough to ask to play with the equipment. He just barged in and demanded.  So the drummer starts and the lions start moving. Then our food arrives! It was hot and fresh and crispy (sesame chicken) with good flavor. The other dishes then arrived for the rest of the family soon after. They were just as well prepared. No complaints from all the others. It took a little longer that it should but I guess it was worth it. We really enjoyed the lion dancing. Once they finally got to start.  The prices also seemed a bit more than usual. But we paid and left a small tip anyways.  Bottom line. Rude servers. Dirty bathroom. Awesome lion dancing and ok food. Reading previous reviews I see that they are under new management. I hope they take stock in these reviews to better themselves and live up to the previous reputation of C-Fu Gormet.",

It was one of the first restaurant foods my son ever ate, and has been a favorite all these years.  But today, we have to say goodbye to our old haunt.  It seems there has been an ownership change, and while that would not stop us from returning (for sentimental reasons, obviously), the significant decline in the service and food quality has.  We visited Sunday during lunch, typically a busy time.  The place was almost empty.  The dim sum carts have mostly been replaced with industrial carts, and nearly all of the food we got was cold.  The barbecue pork was obviously old, and made us sick to our stomachs. Based on other recent reviews, I can't blow it off as a fluke.  It was a good run, but all good things must come to an end.

The duck was dry and they forgot to serve any sauce with it.  The spicy garlic eggplant was acceptable, although not as spicy as one would expect.

The organizer's pre-selected the dishes for the dinner:  Miced Beef Soup - It was ok the cilatro over powered the taste of the soup Hong Kong Walnut Shrimp - The walnuts were not fresh Sliced Abalone with Black Mushrooms - Good taste  Whole Roasted Duck - The duck was very fatty (more than normal) Beef and Black Pepper - It was ok, a little bland Pork Chop with Peking Sauce - This dish was the best Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice - The lettuce was not finely cut, so the large chucks made the dish soggy Fish fried and stir fried - This was very good  Why the 2 stars?  The service sucked!  They didn't tell you what dish it is when they bring it out.  And you wait forever for refills.  And when someone on the our table asked for a bag, they pointed to the station for us to get it ourselves.  And the place was SUPER HOT!  The air kicked on every once in awhile.

A friend and I had dinner last week and we ended up at C-Fu because I was in the mood for some authentic Chinese.  Well, he's Chinese (kinda - haha) and recommended this restaurant because he grew-up coming here with his parents.    We ordered some dumplings, which they steamed for us, a spicy pork chop dish and then I ordered my favorite which wasn't on the menu, sauteed fish filet in black bean sauce.  All of the food was good and they were very nice in accommodating my special order.  I'd reorder any of the dishes we had again, and I really loved having left-overs the next day. :)  See ya there!",

I didn't expect much, and that's what I got.  We ordered 5 appetizers: egg rolls, crab rangoons, fried shrimp, crispy quail, and chicken lettuce wraps. Food came out in stages, the first 3 arriving quickly, served with pots of sweet and sour, spicy mustard, and pepper flakes in oil. The pots were dirty. The egg rolls were overcooked but were otherwise pretty standard. The shrimp was cook right. The rangoons were also fine, as far as plain and uninspired rangoons go. The quail came out next, completely dry. But crispy, anyway. The chicken for the lettuce wraps had almost no flavor; you had to pour on plum sauce for it to taste like anything. The lettuce cups were full of water; I shook one off for a minute or 2 and it was still dripping on me.   Service is fast and friendly; prices are decent. Basically a totally average Chinese place.",

During Saturday and Sunday, they offer a pretty extensive Dim Sum menu.  I pride myself in being an adventurous eater, and this is the perfect place for people like me.  They have the usual Dim Sum fare, but they also have dishes like jellyfish, tripe soup, chicken feet, etc.. It may seem a little intimidating to a newcomer, so ask a person at the next table for recommendations if you need it.    The regular menu is pretty good as well.  I have dined here with my family for years.  This is a perfect place to have a family gathering.  You can have a nice hearty and delicious dinner for 12 people for less than $100, and that includes drinks a bunch of food left over to take home.  My favorite dishes here are:  Beef Westlake Style Soup. Salty Fish and Chicken Fried Rice Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles Peking Duck Peking Pork Chops Fried Flounder w/ Black Bean Sauce Spicy Eggplant w/ Tofu  The staff is always friendly.  As with all Dim Sum style restaurants, don't be afraid to flag down the cart lady, and if that doesn't work, flag down the waitress and tell her what you want.  They always seem willing to help in the event that you get skipped over in the rotation.  In the event that you are in need of banquet service, this is a very viable option.  I had 85+ people come celebrate my wife's birthday a few years ago, and this restaurant did not disappoint.  All I actually had to do was call a week in advance, let them know my budget, choose the dishes, and make the payment.  They took care of everything else.  It was nice and easy and I took credit for it all.",

I came in at around 11 am for dim sum (1130 is basically prime time for when all the good dim sum is out) and got my normal order of hargao, shrimp in rice noodles and spicy wontons. All dishes were lukewarm which is astonishing to me. It's supposed to be served hot! My absolute favorite hargao had the disgusting texture of mush which would horrify anyone trying it for the first time, and my rice noodles with shrimp was soggy and had a horrible sauce with it. Honestly this review is a reality check for this restaurant. Get your stuff together!",

There were a lot of lofaan here enjoying it, which is nice since everything on the carts was declared in English, but there was a mix of Mandarin and Cantonese speakers among the staff and clearly some who spoke neither. The calamari had the appearance of being , but it was just fried calamari that you could get at any bar or restaurant.

For some reason, we returned back to C-Fu to try it again, but the service was horrible!! We requested water and tea, and in my water cup and all around it were white residue from a previous mixed drink of another customer. I had already drank half of the iced water and realized there was all over the sides of the cup. I immediately asked for a replacement and even the server was grossed out!

Until today (when we returned to that other place near Lee Lee's), the last four or five times we have had dim sum we have gone to C-Fu. The reason is simple. You go on Sunday, which for those not in the know is prime dim sum territory, and you are seated and served right away. No lines, no waiting on the carts, no \"shu mai is coming\" (it seems like most places run out that early even though they must know it is one of the most popular dishes), and fairly attentive service.   Why C-Fu when they food might be slightly better across the street? Well, the quality has gone down a bit. C-Fu which, by the way, was one of the first places to offer dim sum in the Valley, and one of the first around to offer \"real\" Chinese food, seems to,  once in awhile, rest on their laurels and ease up on yummy-ness. However, the food is still not bad and, because of new competition and the slight decrease in quality, you can get in, get food, and get out quickly. For that, their history, and their quick service, I still give them four stars. I just hope they take the food up a little notch in the future so they can return to their place as the premier Chinese restaurant in the area.",

They have the access to some of the freshest seafood / produce/ ect. available, with there location so close to lee's market place which flies in fish and other Asian inspired staples daily. Plus lee's has special selections for near by restaurants.   They have the whole gamete of edible creatures available. From jelly fish to duck. And there recipes bring them to their best. Everything is family style, so bring friends/family for great food and conversation. There is a bar, but not really a place where your looking to drink. I think it's there just for the wedding/events they put on.   It is a culture shock. So don't get all weird if there is a language barrier or if you not use to a rotating Asian condiment tray iin the middle of a family style table. That is what makes it so special. If you have issues with that buy Rosetta Stone and get over it.",

    "text": "This is a review for dinner. Came here for dinner with a group party.    We chose C-Fu cause it was spacious enough to allow us a private party.  We requested arrangements for karaoke and stage.  We had a blast!   The service was excellent and the food was very good and very authentic.   The owners offered us crab with tamarine sauce, which was a fresh change from the usual ginger garlic sauce.  Crab was excellent.   Now I'm bummed cause I don't know anyone else who makes crab with that secret sauce!  The walnut prawns were delicious and quickly devoured.    Gailon & mushrooms and other dishes were spot on and far better than I would have expected to find in Phoenix.    It was the perfect place for our family gathering.   Will return to try the dim sum and will definitely keep C-Fu in mind for future dinner banquets.",

She was supposed to get back $44 and a few cents. She only gave my mom $40 back. Then as my boyfriend and I were saying our goodbyes, the cashier comes running out screaming at us in Chinese I believe. We couldnt understand her at all. We kept saying sorry we don't understand. She kept speaking loudly. My mother had paid, she got short changed, we walked out the door and she came to chase us down for a tip. Like she demanded a tip right there and then. I should have said no thank you but gave her $10. I feel as that was very unprofessional and a bad practice for such a business. We are not obligated to tip. Our water was not being filled, my main dish came at the end that I ordered and by then I was full eating everything else.",

My top 3 were: 1) eggplant with shrimp 2) rice wrapped in the leaf 3) spicy wonton  I really liked how they actually cook the eggplant, taro cake, and chive dumpling right in front of you. So when you bite it, it's piping hot! Apparently they used to do this back in the day back home but I don't remember.  I thought the other typical dumplings like the hau gau and shu mai were just okay. The Chinese broccoli was also a little over cooked but overall the good definitely out weighted the bad. I will definitely come back and try more.   Don't forget to rub the buddha's belly!",

The muchu wraps on first bite smell rotten vegetable like from a garbage dump. I took the meat filling out separately and it tasted okay. When I mentioned the fact to the waitress, she said it was the flour used in the wrapping. I disagreed. Another server passer-by mentioned that it may be due to the vegetable bat choy, which I agreed is rotten and smelling like decomposing garbage. I believe this would be a health hazard for anybody eating this. A visit from the Health Department would be helpful for the sake of the clients. E Coli or other infectious origins would be likely. Fof the sake of your health, I highly would not recommend this restaurant due to the hazardous food preparation standards putting the public in great danger.",

A table came in 20 min after us has already had their soup. There doesn't seem to be enough workers to cover the entire restaurant. Few kids are constantly running around the place as well as up and down the stage. Rule one of restaurant etiquette, control your kids!  The food was pretty good though, not sure if it was cause we were super hungry by the time the food came. Today being Chinese New Years they had a special treat with some lion dancers.

While the restaurant itself is definitely had better days and has an air of out dated elegance, the food is pretty white-washed and Americanized.    If I am to drag myself out of bed for dim sum on my precious weekend, I expect hot steamy food and delicious steam to waft over me.  Instead, the food is always mediocre and warm at best.  Don't arrive too early for dim sum or you'll get the leftover steamers from the prior day.  While their food isn't downright disgusting, the targeted audience has definitely changed the past few years.  I say come around 11pm so you get the fresh dishes of the day.   I will say that their custard buns are probably the best --- specifically the pineapple baos.",

Beside the noise coming from the other event, when the wedding ceremony is running, one lady from the other event walked to us and complained about the wedding is TOO LOUD (whose weeding that do not play music?). The MC told her to talk to the restaurant's manager but she was just staying there and kept complaining about the noise we are making. WTH. ITS A WEDDING LADY. YOU SHOULD NOT RUIN PEOPLE WEDDING LIKE THAT. After 15 minutes fight, she decided to leave and left the bride, groom and the guesses feeling weird and awkward. The restaurant should not book 2 different kinds of event like that in one night and until now, according to the bride, they did not even apologize or do anything about that event. I will never book any event here nor come here to eat anymore with this poor management.",

The manager convinced me that the other party won't stay long & won't play music, just talking only. I HAD NO CHOICES, BUT ANGRILY ACCEPTED because it was too late to change! But then I WAS TRULY SHOCKED when i came to the wedding. It was crowded & loud on the other side. Additionally, when we started to play music, a lady from the other side came & yelled at us that we had to turn off the music. it showed how unprofessional they were when the managers stood on a side did nothing to stop the fight. Nevertheless, nobody served the beers even when we paid $80 a case. The food wasn't good & a lot of left over, so the service. THE MANAGERS DID NOT SAY A WORD EVEN AN APOLOGIZE. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE that nobody in that night want to remember. PLS REMEMBER THAT Don't ever hold 2 different parties at the same time for any reasons if you don't want this to happen again otherwise just close the business!",

Lots of choices and you don't have to wait long for a cart with a new item to come by your table.  Last night though, I went there just for dinner. One thing I noticed is that the menu is in Chinese and English and there is no explanation provided about any entree.  So, if you don't know what something is or you wonder what ingredients are in a dish, you have to ask your server. Given that their menu is quite long, I think asking your server what each dish is, is a little crazy.  It is definitely an \"authentic\" Chinese restaurant, where most of the conversation amongst patrons is in Chinese. There are also things on the menu that Americanized Chinese restaurants simply don't have--like salted cod fried rice.   For me, it's not the best Chinese food I've had. See my review on Desert Jade for the best Chinese food. But I would go back here again especially for dim sum.",

So I trusted her and went to China King for Dim Sum until they closed down.  I was so sad until our friends said Mekong palace does Dim Sum so we went there few times.  I wasn't impressed but beggars can't be choosers.  This Easter Sunday I was craving for Dim Sum so we got up early and went to Mekong at 10:00am.  This place was so packed and the line was so long we had waiting time of 1 to 2 hours.  I said no way and we left Mekong.  My mood was terrible.  My husband said let's just try C-Fu Gourmet for lunch instead.  He was hoping my mood would improve with some yummy greasy Chinese food...   And it did!!! When these amazing Dim Sum aroma welcomed me to their restaurant.  We set right front of the kitchen door and it was WONDERFUL.  We got fresh pickings of all the Dim Sums.  I was sad when dessert cart came over without my favorite Egg tarts but my disappointment didn't last long.  Wonderful serving lady said don't worry I got you.  When Egg tarts came out she stopped at our table first with these hot and yummy tarts.  I was so full by then but my wonderful husband said let's share one and take the others to go.  I am so happy to find C-Fu Gourmet does Dim Sum and they do Dim Sum every day according to the cashier.  Best Easter Sunday Ever:)",

The server's response, \"We're quite busy right now and we don't have time for that.\" Having experience in the service industry, I was appalled by his response, as were my family around the table.

The thing is, you have to call ahead to reserve this food because it can take some preparing times within 30-45mins. We ordered lobsters first, but then there were all baby minion lobsters so we might as well tried other specialties. I think we hit a jackpot when a party of 5 who ordered this came pretty late, so of course we had a pleasure to shorten the wait time for this one.  We arrived at 7pm, got seated right away in the middle of the pathway. We ordered crab meat and asparagus soup for appetizer, Singapore Mai for the add on, the baked fish, along with some boosters for a fun and warm night with friends.   The waitresses who served us were amazingly charming and friendly. They already knew what we wanted ahead of time without even have to clarify.   The soup is tasty as always, we had the selections of soy sauce, chili oil and pepper on the side in case we wanted some extra flavors. We didn't touch the Singapore Mai because we saved room for the main plate. And here we come, a giant big baked fish with numerous garnishes... My mouth is watery just to think about this delish plate. I forgot to mention the bill was pretty decent too.  Good food, good company, and greatest service ever. We will come back.",

    "text": "They have a good thing going here and they just don't know it or don't care about their customers.  Upon arriving the restaurant was dingy and crowded with people waiting.  I understand most Chinese restaurants are dingy, but some still have great food so I ignored the atmosphere.  We waited for about 10 minutes and were seated.  Once we were seated we saw about 8 open tables, but still a crowd of people waiting by the door.  Obviously, they don't manage seating their patrons very well.  The food was ok, not as good as Chinatown in Chicago.  Their dumplings and siopaio were tasty, but BBQ pork was fatty and dry like jerky.  Their servers were less than friendly and treated us like we were an inconvenience.  I'd go back to try some items on their menu, since some of their items were good.  The only reason I would go back is because it is hard to find authentic Chinese food near Scottsdale.  I will give them another chance also because their owner actually read my review and apologized for my bad experience.",

    "text": "Ever since the departing of the great Silver Dragon restaurant, (formerly located at 19th Ave. and Dunlap) I have been searching the valley for a place that could compare.  After months of salty beef chow fun, sub-par shrimp and walnuts, and no crispy chicken or duck, I was told to try this place.  The weirdo grocery store entrance opens into a strange reception area with a wall of statues.  The dining area is open and there is even a stage for karaoke!  The decor is very oriental restaurant-ish, but the tanks of fish and crustaceans are a nice touch.  It was refreshing to look over the menu and see every dish that I loved from our old Chinese restaurant.  My group ordered our standard Chinese dinner: sizzling rice soup, walnut shrimp, beef chow fun (dry), crispy chicken, kung pao chicken and fried rice.  Our soup arrived promptly and it was like a big warm chinese hug.  All the memories from Silver dragon came flooding back.  We had barely finished the soup when our food came rushing out, but that's what I expect from chinese food.  Words cannot describe the deliciousness that I experienced.  I had a bizarre flashback the moment the warm creamy shrimp and crunchy candied walnut hit my tongue.  I felt a tingle rush up my spine and I knew that I would be hooked on this restaurant.  The beef chow fun was a perfect balance of saltiness, meatiness, and the oh-so good charred/smokiness that comes from a fast stir-fry over a jet engine stove.  The crispy chicken was sublime combination of texture and taste.  And the kung pao was also good, but we order that just for some spice.  All in all, it was a surprisingly great dinner.  P.S. After the fantastic dinner, we went back for dim sum lunch and it was also unbelievable.  The place was packed with people but we got a table right away.  Immediately after we were seated the food frenzy started.  I was surprised at the wide array of dim sum offered, some of which I didn't think I could find outside of San Francisco.  The chicken feet were spicy, sweet, and tender.  The shrimp toasts were superbly buttery and crunchy.  The tripe soup was amazing.  The ha gau were delicate and perfectly balanced.  The Lotus-leaf rice was delicious.  And, the stuffed jalepenos were a spicy surprise, I had only had these with bell peppers but the jalepenos are a nice contrast to the sweet shrimp filling..  If you're searching for a chinese restaurant reminiscent of Grant Ave. this is it.",

    "text": "Just went here on Christmas day. Arizona is not known for having any great Chinese restaurants. I honestly find Panda Express the only better quality Chinese food around locally. Mostly what you find are buffets, and I hate those. C Fu Gourmet is different. It's actually a real Chinese restaurant! It's located in a shopping center in Chandler with a handful of Asian businesses. This is a non-discript place, but once inside, you get the feel of a real Chinese restaurant. It has the fish tank and handi-crafts for sale, but the work force is Asian and the customers were mostly Asian and that's a really good sign. One thing you notice is the servers going around with carts that have daily specials on them. They go table to table and offer you to try the Dim Sum or other option. We ordered off the menu. I had the Kung Pau chicken meal that comes with rice, a spring roll, and  soup. I wasn't crazy about the soup. It was wonton and it was okay, but there was something about it that I didn't like, not sure what though. The Kung Pau chicken was awesome! It had just the right flavor and it was the perfect amount for one person. The spring roll was pretty good too. It wasn't oily which makes all of the difference with a spring roll. Had a great time and a great meal. I found the staff to be friendly and they answered all of our questions. I would go back again.",

The restaurant setting itself was okay and we were seated right away. From ordering our beverages to ordering our food, the waitresses were nothing but short tempered and rude. One thing they need to do away with is their facial expressions, dead give away to your reactions of us needing more time, ladies. I was seriously blown away that we were treated with such disrespect. What really got me, was when my boyfriend was ordering his meal, the waitress wouldn't allow him to have Chow Mein noodles. She strictly told him to get Lo Mein. Which was very shocking and displeasing...and a big no no. Last time I checked it's all about pleasing the customers. If it's clearly on the menu, why isn't it able to be ordered? When it came to clearing the table, the waitress asked if we wanted boxes for the leftovers of our food, we replied \"No thank you.\" But that wasn't clear enough, we got asked a second, third, and fourth time. We still said no thank you, with a few chuckles of uneasiness...and to that we got a nasty look thrown our way. I will never go back to this restaurant. I'd rather starve.",

Since I had been looking for a Dim Sum place in Phoenix (similar to Chinatown in Chicago) we decided to give C-Fu a try. The food was \"ok\" but nothing to write home about (we came for lunch on the first visit). Dingy looking place, the food carts took forever to come around and food was  mostly cold.    The next visit was during dinner and we ordered the family meal from the menu that comes with appetizer, two entrees, etc. Although it was better than the lunch fare, it was no stand-out meal.    We decided to give lunch another try the other day and had a MISERABLE experience. Again, carts took forever, and with the exception of first order of steamed dumplings (shrimp and pork), everything was cold. To top it off, my 5 yr old son and I got terribly ill later that day. I spent the whole night hugging the toilet and was almost sent to the ER to get rehydrated. Needless to say, we are never going back to C-Fu! Oh, and they don't tell you that 15% tip is already added on to the check. Sneaky!",

We loaded up on a few dishes, and I'm glad we did because after we did the carts were nowhere to be seen in our part.  They went around the side of the restaurant to the back tables, ignoring us.  We probably would have spent more money but they wouldn't serve us.  Meanwhile, the staff would keep coming up to us asking if we were done.  I mean this happened like 3 times in 15 minutes.  We kept saying no, but they wouldn't bring the cart by.  In fact, one of them even took my plate away.  Long story short, I'm not coming back.",

I'm a little surprised by some of the negative feedback given of C-Fu, but admittedly the place can seem a little rowdy, with the service sometimes being spotty, and the selections a little sparse (especially on weekdays).  But, on the whole, you're bound to find dim sum classics like pork siu mai, har gow, etc..., and on weekends the place is brimming with grill carts serving stuffed bell peppers, chinese broccoli (kai lan), and a soup vat is hauled around the dining hall with traditional \"jook\" (cantonese rice porridge).  On all counts, (and I've heard that C-Fu's Asian customers have been fleeing to China King), C-Fu still matches up well with its local competitors and has improved as the stiff competition of other dim sum eateries has grown in Chandler.  To answer some other critics, we don't live in San Francisco or Hong Kong, and this place (or any other local restaurant) won't match up to San Francisco, LA, or Mott Street (NYC), but it comes pretty close, and you can't ask for too much more than that when you live in Phoenix.    Overall, C-Fu is a decent place to go, and in the Valley, it is one of the best dim sum places you can bring your custom to, IMHO.",

Yes, it's a little dirty, yes the service is spotty, they are not constantly coming around refilling your water everytime you take a sip, but the food is first rate!  I recommend the Crispy Spinach '2' dish that is on the menu under house specialties; it's a bed of fried spinach with a spicy chicken, shrimp, and vegetable medley on top. fantastic!  The wonton soup is also very good, a little different than I'm used to; the wontons here are filled with meat and seafood.  All the seafood at C-Fu is wonderful, very fresh and prepared the way you ask for it.

    "text": "When I was growing up in the area, C-Fu was THE place for Dim Sum. No matter when we went, there was always a full lobby to wait behind. Parking lot was full from C-Fu alone, and eventually you'd recognize some of the staff, like the guy in the Hawaiian shirt who always had my calamari. It's almost incredulous that after almost a decade in the Bay only a few places could beat my standard.  After all those years, I went back with my bro and I could barely recognize the place. On a Saturday with an almost ghost-like parking lot, I was shocked by no wait, and further with over half the seating empty. With maybe a quarter of the staff I'd remember, there were literally 4 tables occupied. A lot of the staff seemed younger too, as opposed to being completely swarmed by Chinese or Vietnamese speaking staff.  Unlike Mekong or any other dim sum place here, C-Fu swarmed me with literally every cart over the course of 2 minutes. Miraculously even with a much smaller selection they had every item we wanted, and we were off to the races.  Thankfully my faith was restored with the first bite. Everything I've had from the fresh turnip cakes to the ha gow tasted exactly as I remembered - excellent. But it wasn't without issue. Without a full house there was no steady flow in the kitchen, meaning a lot of dishes were sitting out. Calamari, chow mein, fried shrimp balls, green beans - while some of these favorites were cooked and seasoned to point, they were so cold to bite into.   The potential of C-Fu to me has not gone down. Perhaps Mekong or other newer dim sum joints are drawing away traffic. However, I was told Sundays were much busier. I would advise going when it's fuller to get a more traditional experience. I'll definitely be back for that.",

My best friend had hold a wedding in this restaurant and have told the manager in advance that  they want to be the only group on that day. The restaurant manager had accepted the offer.But on the day of the wedding, the manager have accept one more group party next to our group. Both parties have loud music and there was a lady in other group on the other side came over during the wedding ceremony \"yelling and cursing\" in the stage nonstop. She was keep standing there and refused to go back to the other side. I would never go to this place again. Wedding is a once a life moment and you don't want that special time to be ruined. If I was you, I would stay away from this restaurant.",

I was hesitant to pay this place a visit after I read the reviews of how this restaurant went downhill throughout the years. The interior of the restaurant definitely had its better days: the floor was less desired, thundering automatic doors, and a fish tank that screamed to be cleaned (pictures ahead). I ordered the whole roasted duck that came out warm which was odd as most restaurants I have ordered at always served them luke warm. Definitely a plus for me as well as coming with rice, and sauce of the duck. The duck was good, you can actually taste the aromatics they used to flavor the duck- ginger, garlic, onions! The skin was crisp and succulent, paired nicely with the rice. Overall I'll come back for the whole roasted duck again but might have to stay away from eating there.",

The best deal is the Toro (radish) cake.  They are huge.  The are 2 inches thick.  I ordered an extra order, took it home, cut them in thinner pieces and pan fried them so that they are crispy. I highly recommend this place for cheap dim Sum. If you have not been to the AYCE  Lunch Dim Sum buffet at the Casino Arizona, you should try it.  It is off I-17 and McKelips.  They charge $12.  It is a great buffet without Dim Sum.",

Once we were seated it took someone over 5 mins to get our drink order. Drinks were brought out and we told the server that brought the drinks we were ready to order. She said she can't take the orders but would ask someone to come take our order.  The other party that had 10 people in it didn't even get their drink order taken and they were getting a little annoyed that they were being ignored as well.   Well they got the servers attention and she said that she would be right back but since it was well over 15 mins since we sat down I felt that we were being treated not proper. We were calling around to other restaurants seeing if they were busy while sitting inside (no one noticed or cared)  and called 2 places (Phoenix palace and pacific seafood buffet) while we were sitting there We didn't pay for our drinks and just got up and left. From the looks of things the servers and staff was more focused on the other side of the room.  Even though this place is close too our house and it was our first time there we won't be going back there any time soon...   My wife and I went to pacific seafood buffet and had a great time there.  I noticed when I sat down the chairs were dirty / black stained on every chair.  That should have been a tip off too.  C-FU later!!!!",

Our drink order wasn't taken until we were a good 10-15 minutes into the meal.  The sugar cane shrimp was in a pool of oil, the siu mai were mushy with the noodle slipping off, the spare ribs tasted of chemicals, and the coconut custard bread was doughy and inedible.  No sweet rice cakes or custard tarts to be seen.  It's more open with the wall to the sushi bar taken out, but parts of the interior are now very tacky and cheap looking (the rainbow-lit stage, large white floor fans racked on to a light rigging, wheeled partitions blocking off stacked furniture, hand-written \"no outside alcohol\" signs taped to the fire exit door).  The men's restroom had no paper towels and two hand dryer \"shells\" with the actual hand drying machine missing.  I will stick with Phoenix Palace across the street by Lee Lee for dim sum.",

The food is bette quality because the new owner kept best practices of making noodles from scratch and seafood is brought in from cold waters.  The people are always nice and accommodating which is always an automatic star.  Pick up a dim sum menu and order from there if your not comfortable.  The only downside I have noticed is that True peppers and eggplant were well overlooked but I can overlook that because everything else is fresh and clean.",

    "text": "Having been in Arizona for several months now, I have been on the hunt for good Asian cuisine. What can I say... I was pretty spoiled living in LA. (Why can't there be a 24/7 Korean soondubu place here?! But I digress.)  So I consulted Yelp for a good dim sum place one fine Sunday morning. Unfortunately, that morning my friends in town had to drive back to Irvine ASAP, so even though C-Fu Gourmet had the most mediocre Yelp reviews, it was the earliest one open (9:30am while Phoenix Palace opens at 10am) so I brought everyone along to Chandler to see what quality of dim sum Arizona had to offer. It also helped that my coworker recommended C Fu Gourmet, so I had high expectations.   It was.. ok. My party of 5 were the first ones in at 9:30am, so I don't blame them for being a little slow. But the variety of dim sum was underwhelming. Not bad, just nothing spectacular. Plus, their dessert cart was meh!  In the end, we paid about $60 including tip for a party of 5. Service was really slow, even in giving us the check.  I'd come back to C Fu if I really needed dim sum at 9:30am, but if you can stand to wait an extra thirty minutes, I prefer the dim sum and service at Phoenix Palace across the street.  One thing though, the actual restaurant at C Fu Gourmet is much nicer than Phoenix Palace. It looks more impressive and more expensive even though it's the same price in the end. Too bad the food and service don't live up to their looks.",

Even though the mein was covered with aluminum foil, it didn't help. Our Char Siu Bao was tasty and this shrimp ball which turned out to be a ball of rice with stuffed ground shrimp had too much rice and no flavor. Compare that to the fried shrimp ball and the Sugar cane shrimp ball, you lose. The crunch from the both of the shrimp ball's was yummy. We also ordered ShaoMai and HarGaw which was nice and HOT and oh so good. The Sticky Rice was really sticky and COLD. What's happening?? Good thing we ordered hot tea. Our favorite dessert is the Sesame Ball with sweet black bean paste in the center. I also tried their custard which was light and tasty.",

At our table we were greeted by an unfriendly, non-smiling young or welcoming young woman. We all ordered water \"with lemon\" and never got lemon. We placed our orders with difficulty--the girl wasn't explaining the menu items well or didn't answer our questions about certain foods. After waiting awhile the girl brought my entree and set it down in front of me. I was shocked at such disrespect-- went up to the girl at the register by this time. I asked what's going on?!? I've had my food 10 minutes and my other three friends' food has NOT been served! I'll be through eating before my friends even get their food!!! She said oh it's coming out. I said no it isn't!!! Returned to the table and we waited and the others didn't get their food! I'll bet we sat there for 10 minutes or longer before the next entree came which left two friends without their entrees! Waited another 5-10 minutes and then the girl FINALLY brought the other two entrees!!! What kind of mentality do they have there?!? Other people were coming in after us AND THEY GOT THEIR FOOD!!! I wasn't going to eat my meal and then have to watch my friends eat their entrees in stages--at 10 minute intervals! My entree wasn't even that good and it got cold. I asked our waitress for more water. She didn't even look or acknowledge me in ANY way whatsoever! I said excuse me, hello! She just kept walking. I know she heard me! Then finally she came to our table with a water pitcher and filled our glasses. That proved she heard me and proceeded to ignore me. Our weekly lunches together are meant to be fun, pleasant and enjoyable. There are a million other places we could have gone to! I had heard they weren't very good any more but thought I'd give them a try. THERE IS NO WAY ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH WILL WE EVER DARKEN THEIR FRICKEN DOORSTEPS AGAIN! Panda Express at the mall food court  is 100% better than C-Fu!!! I do not recommend this place to anyone! The food tasted bland, not much flavor and I ordered sweet & sour chicken! How do you ruin that dish??? My friend ordered hot tea and got charged for it--there were 5 tiny leaves in the teapot! This place is bad news! Take my advice AND NEVER GO THERE!",

Since leaving my comfort zones of the Bay Area and Las Vegas, I was dying for dim sum.  What a gem this place is.  It's loud, crazy and over crowded on the weekends, but service is fast, nice and friendly.  I love the dim sum.  Dare I say I've found my all time favorite dim sum place ever?  I think I am going to!  We've taken some of my husband's co-workers to dim sum -- we think it may have been a bit too exotic and overwhelming for them.  We didn't care, we still ate.  A definite place to be for cheap group eats.",

    "text": "We just visited C-Fu Gourment this past weekend. We have tried other Chinese places and loved them, but was looking to try a new one. We decided on this location. My husband was skeptical at first (he wanted to try another one) but he finally agreed. I am so glad we went. We had our 4 year old with us and it wasn't very crowded. She loves Chinese food and trying to use chopsticks. One thing we noticed is that the menu did state MSG is used but speak to your server about other options. The other options was basically the server writing down no MSG. They are able to prepare any of the dishes without it. When our food came, the server also brought my daughter chopsticks without being asked. She loved that. She also loved the food and as promised, it contained no MSG (I get sick after eating MSG). The food was not very greasy. My husband had ordered a beef and bell pepper dish but didn't eat all the bell peppers. This is because he personally loves the flavor peppers brings, but doesn't like to eat alot of the actual peppers. The manager/owner came over and let us know they could customize any dish and he could just ask for no peppers next time. When my husband explained he likes the flavor, she smiled and went ah ok. I loved that the manager/owner had come over just to make sure everything was alright. The best thing is that this Chinese place caused no reaction. Sometimes when I eat Chinese food, I make a few trips to the bathroom  (even in places that state no MSG) but this was not the case. I didn't even need to go in once and neither did my husband. This has become a top favorite and we will be back.",

    "text": "Used to go here often for dim sum and have enjoyed the experience each time.  Although dim sum is served daily, I've only visited on Saturdays and Sundays.  Gets VERY crowded after 12pm, so try and arrive by 11am if you want a chance at the fresher selections.    Love their egg tarts, beef tripe, short ribs, mango custard, shu mai, sugar cane shrimp, and fried rice balls (with seasoned ground pork filling).    Be sure to try and ask for a table near the aisles as sometimes it's hard for the ladies to maneuver the carts in between tables.    Prices are decent for each dim sum item.  We sometimes order a couple of dishes off the regular menu, to supplement the smaller dim sum items.    Since PHX doesn't offer alot of dim sum options, C-Fu will remain my top choice for dim sum cravings.",

The second time I went,  we ordered vegetable fried rice...maybe the chef was having an off night, but the veggies were straight from the freezer bag and still cold. (you know, the little orange carrot cubes and peas from that mixed back in your local grocery store freezer?)  That off night turned us off to the place - how hard is to to chop some carrots up and stir fry with some rice..so we never went back.   Its big inside and the entry way has statues and such that are entertaining to look at. Stick with the Dim Sum.",

One of the things I like about C-Fu is that there is a list of sauces and preparations and you decide what you want with it.  You want shrimp, tofu , and scallop Kung Pao? No problem. The combinations are endless.  Best dim sum around also. Lots of carts going around with lots of fresh items.  I went there with a couple of guys from Hong Kong, and they said it was some of the best dim sum they had had in the U.S.  One thing I did notice is that the REALLY obscure and odd stuff (deep fried chicken feet, tripe) comes around early in the service, and the more mainstream items (ribs, egg rolls) tend to come out after 11:30 or so.  Don't know if it's intentional, but it seems to be a trend.  Yes, it's loud and raucous, but from what I was told by the Hong Kong dudes, that's the way it is over there.  If you are looking for an austere Sunday brunch, C-Fu is not the place to go.",

Here in AZ there are many fast food places that dumb down there representation of chinese food.  Orange chicken and Sweet and sour chicken aren't the only fantastic dishes the chinese have to offer.  Broaden your culinary horizons and try something more authentic.  Try Dim sum ... It's awesome and fun!!",

So, I ate some shrimp spring rolls and sampled others. I steered clear of fried stuff, but it didn't seem to matter. My belly was upset almost immediately. Maybe it was the coconut bread. I couldn't help myself; it was super tasty!  After my friends had plucked something off the dessert cart, the server brought us some bok choy. I thought they were out, but I guess they had some hiding in the kitchen? Anyway, I ate that happily. It was the first time I ever tried bok choy. I'm a fan! Not of this place but of the super healthy veggie.   I think I'd rather go to YC's Mongolian Grill again before ever coming back here.",

Mostly I go here for dinner. Their food is good, not the most amazing but they have big servings and the service is always good. The place is HUGE, they even have a karaoke section sort of walled off which I sometimes see people using I am guessing you have to book it or something.   My favorite part is that when they have pastries left over from Dim Sum they give them out for free after your meal, you don't always get one but when you do it makes you think \"yes, I am the lucky one\".",

Sad because the platter was larger when we ordered one lobster in the past. Food was good. But service was slacking. I believe it was the owner that came out from the back.

My clue to have high tailed it out of there should have been when I walked in at 6:15 on a Friday evening with a friend and there was no body else in this giant place!! Service was good(3stars) Hot&sour soup good Steamed Dumplings-tasteless and rubbery House special egg foo young Again,very bland ..3 tiny pieces of pork...5 baby shrimps $22 Ripoff. Mandarin beef and scallops- Served on sizzling plate .. Again...small portion and tiny cheap scallops..  I really can't see a place like this lasting much longer",

The food came out warm and not that great. :/ the staff is friendly but the service is a bit slow. In my experience with dim sum, carts usually move faster and go from table to table.  I was also surprised that C-Fu had the taro cake. I've only had taro cake in Chinatown in Chicago. The taro cake didn't meet my expectations. It was warm and plain.  C-Fu has really good custards and Barbecue pork buns!",

The food looked old, soggy, over cooked (or been sitting out for hours).  I took a small bite of the sui mai and it was cold.  Actually every item was cold.  The color of the items were even off, meaning it's been sitting out and not fresh.  We immediately asked for the check and left without eating what they put on our table.

It was once a place you couldn't get in but for waiting on a long wait list  of hungry people. The wait was well-deserved. You were rewarded on Sunday morning with fresh, warm food and fast, friendly service during the wait, during your meal and when you checked out. The owner scrambled to please. The place was filled with Asian people who knew good Dim Sum and others who enjoyed each bite. And it was so clean that you could eat off the floor. Now, you can't eat off the table!!!!!  The place at 9 AM on Sunday was filled and noisy and wonderful. Today there were a few schmucks like me- visiting now from SoCal and did not know it was sold to some crappy chain. Cold food!Double the price! New crappy owners. I commented and the staff pretends not to speak English.  Look at the reviews.Don't know how they are still open just a few folks there but let's all work together to make this insult to Chinese food and the Chinese eating experience and Put It Down! Don't go there! MAKE IT CLOSE AND SOON. You will be doing Phoenix Metro a favor.",

It is definitely a good venue for a large gathering and the restaurant was appropriately festively decorated for the occasion. The dishes themselves seemed to be hit or miss. The crab claw appetizers were crunchy and delicious. For such an exceptional-sounding dish, the chicken and ginseng soup was unexceptional. The roast chicken was flavorful, as were the black mushroom/bokchoy, mixed seafood, and lobster dishes. The deep fried fish with sweet-sour sauce was overcooked and dry, and the pork chop dish was unremarkable. A refreshing coconut gelatin desert capped the meal. Service was good and the servers were very efficient at bringing the various dishes and clearing out the plates from the lazy susan to make way for the next dishes.",

It's soft and filled with yellow, sweet custard. Other variations of the pastry doesn't cut it with me.

See below for a link to guide you. I've had a lot of dim sum in my life but this was my first having dim sum in Arizona. I'm new here and in search for good dim sum.   They calculate all their dim sum size portions (A, B, C, D) the same price, $3.50. We ate a pretty good amount for two people and the total for each of us is $11.50. Dayummmm, you can't beat that price for their quality of food.   Some classic suggestions if you're new to dim sum (I don't want to scare you off cause things can get a little wild ): baked bbq pork bun, steam bbq pork bun, and pork sui mai.  For the rest of us who aren't afraid : chicken feet, shrimp fun roll, and steam soup dumpling (Siu Luhng Bao)   C-Fu in Chandler was not disappointing but I wouldn't say it was good either. I would say I'm still in search of my go to dim sum place in AZ area.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dimsumcentral.com%2Fdim-sum-menu-guide%2F&s=419872351d8128e3419560d41c559d017082a56b19b84fc96a0851db4bcd7205\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">dimsumcentral.com/dim-su...</a>",

Our bill was $20 and some change, so my husband left a 4 dollar tip on the tip line and paid with a credit card. So I notice on our statement that it charged the $25 something and then a few days later, ran another $5 charge. So not only do they add on 15%, but they added it on to the total of what the bill was AFTER the tip he wrote in....so we paid another 15% of the bill plus the tip he wrote in.  WHAT?   I thought, what the hell is that????  And then I scanned some other reviews and saw that someone mentioned an automatic 15% tip added on. So beware of that and don't tip!!  Your bill already has it in there.  Other than that I did enjoy the place and the Dim Sum is decent, though I have not experienced much to compare with. The decor is dark, dingy and sort of run down looking. The place is huge.  It's an adventure, and honestly, that part was fun, but the sneaky charges really left a bad taste in our mouths.",

Not being of the Christmas persuasion, our typical Dec 25 consists of movies and Chinese food.  We had a party of 16 and although I had called earlier, C Fu explained that they could not take a reservation so my wife and I arrived about 30 minutes before everyone else to start to secure seating.  Upon arriving, we were told that seating would not be a problem, but because of a shortage of staff, it was taking about an hour after ordering to be served.  So I left my wife at C Fu and drove across the street to Phoenix Palace.  The place was 90% empty so I told them I needed a table of 16 and I would be right back. Long story short (you can read the full version on Phoenix Palace's page), it took over 2 hours to be served after ordering.  Other parties were seated, served, and left before we received anything.  So now I feel terrible.  C Fu lost my business tonight because they were honest and that sucks.  Although I didn't eat here tonight, I've eaten here a million times: both dinner and dim sum.  Even held 2 bat mitzvah parties here.  Food is always excellent.  Top picks: French tenderloin, c fu chicken, walnut glazed shrimp.",

Their food is fairly average from everything I had; nothing was bad, but nothing was exceptional either.  I went with 4 friends, and had originally ordered a Mango shrimp dish that sounded fantastic.  About 5 minutes before they brought out the rest of the tables food (after bringing appetizers), they told me that they were out of the dish I ordered.  I feel like if they were out of the dish, this could have been told to me much more quickly so I could have updated my order earlier.  This was just one instance of the overall poor service we received.  One of my fellow diners kept trying to get his drink with just a little bit of ice, and only once did he accomplish this throughout the meal.  Every time they brought him a drink with ice packed to the rim of the cup you could see a look of defeat on his face.  Finally toward the end of the meal, he resorted to illustrating about how much ice he wanted using his fingers on the side of the cup.  When the lady returned with a cup full of ice, and Pepsi filled only to the level his finger  had indicated, we all burst into laughter.  To summarize: mediocre food, mediocre at best service...",

I was at the cashier desk to pay my bill. The lady at the counter did not know I can understand Cantonese. So the lady told customer, who is a friend of her, that the 15% tips is already included in the credit card receipt as total. So there is no need to put tips in the blank tip line.   What a shocking finding. If you don't calculate your total bill, you may be paying double tips! What a shame on them. I don't mind to pay 20% tips, but they should told their customer that the total number on your receipt already includes tips!  I have not visited the restaurant since!",

    "text": "After reading all the reviews here about C-Fu Gourmet being the best place for dim sum in the valley, I am really disappointed to be writing my first 1 star review for the area  Was the service rude and uncaring? The answer here is yes.  Especially the way that push-cart servers call out the food which make you feel like you're in a rowdy tourist market full of cheap knock-offs they're trying to get rid of.    But all would have been forgiven if only the dim-sum being served was any good.  However the dishes we ordered reflected a sloppy kitchen that was focused solely on putting in minimal effort and taking every possible shortcut on the food.   Dishes that made me ashamed to be Chinese (yes, the level that C-Fu dimsum brought it down to was that bad):  -  Fried glutinous rice:  The preserved meat that was supposed to flavor the dish was MIA. We complained to one of the waiters who replied that \"they probably forgot\" (um are you sure it's not cost cutting for those who don't know any better?).  More over, the proper way to cook this classic dish would be like risotto where you're constantly stirring and gradually adding water just a little bit at a time (except of course everything is being done in a wok)...Here the C-Fu kitchen obviously just shoved the whole thing into an electric rice-cooker and try to stir fry the huge sticky mess at the end by adding in gallons of oil.     -  Glutinous rice with chicken steamed in lotus leaf:  Once again that electric rice cooker in the back of the kitchen must be working real hard cause the dish lacked the aroma that it would have had if it had actually been steamed in lotus leaf.  Just tasted of sloppy topping of minced chicken and last minute wrapping in the lotus leaf.  Dishes I was amazed by (and no not in a good way):  -  Deep fried taro dumpling:  Have never quite had it in that simplistic way before where the filling literally was just mashed taro held together by a prodigious amount of oil  -  Steamed bok choy:  How the heck do you get oil into steamed vegetable?  C-Fu managed to accomplish this amazing feat of greasy steamed vegetable...unbelievable  On a good note, the Siu Mai was decent.  We did keep on ordering more dishes hopping that something good would pop up...but nope that was it,...so if  you must go to C-Fu for dim-sum...just order order a lot of siu mai and be careful of all the other dishes.  Dinner here was much better. 1 star is for dim-sum only.  Next time I have a dim-sum craving, you'll be finding me across the valley at China Chan's (Glendale) where the short & sweet dimsum offering is cooked by a man who doesn't cut corners and it shows.  That's where I'll be sticking to from now on.",

    "text": "I am going to visit C-Fu for dinner again and write a review for that separately. It has been a while since I visited this place for just dinner, so I will keep this review to my recent visit for dim sum.  In my humble opinion, C-Fu is the best Dim Sum in the valley. I am a firm believer in having to switch up dim sum joints between here, China King and Phoenix Palace, to keep it fresh. That being said, when bringing someone new into the world of dim sum or when entertaining from out of town, C-Fu is old faithful for consistency and variety.   The owner is constantly walking around with the most exotic of the dim sum dishes, lobster, clams in black bean sauce, calamari, etc.  Plenty of the standard dumplings and spring rolls to be found for the timid while the next cart brings chicken feet, tripe and tofu wrapped egg rolls for the more experienced.   I generally order the 50/50 jasmine flower tea instead of the normal fare, but both are solid choices, no matter what you end up with.  When the meal is done, you simply take your card to the front, tip is added automatically and you are on your way out.  Giving C-Fu four stars for the dim sum and dinner review to follow.....",

    "text": "DIM SUM suckas! DIM SUM.  Dim Sum is the greatest thing to hit food since teeth.  I have been holding off on writing this Yelp for months now.  I just could not figure out a way to wrap my head around the awesomeness that is Dim Sum.  I have been eating here pretty much every weekend since I was first introduced to it by fellow Yelpers Jenn H. and  Scott S.  Joe Crack played a role in the introduction as well.  Joe Crack is not a Yelper (He should be though.) but he is a wizard.  So you should be willing to take the suggestion of someone so wise in the ways of the world. He also coined the phrase \"No Goddamn BBQ pork bun!\" Which turns out to be a useful phrase when having Dim Sum, cause they try to shove that down your throat from every cart that comes strolling by.  The absolute greatest thing about Dim Sum is the ability to be eating awesome food within seconds of sitting down.  From the moment you sit down they are coming by with carts of amazing, trying to get you to try everything from BBQ pork bun to Chicken feet.  You could, if you were so inclined, be in and out of the place in 15 minutes and have a belly full of really tasty Chinese food bits.   Some of my favorite things are: The Chinese Broccoli The Spring rolls The Curry meat Triangles The pot stickers And...  My absolute favorite is the Sticky rice. If you go to Dim Sum you have to get the sticky rice.  It is a ball of rice wrapped in a lotus leaf.  Then Jesus and Buddha get together and cry tears of joy over the amazing creation. Then Luke Skywalker and Captain Kirk bless it with a light saber and Tricorder. Then Kurt Cobain plays a misunderstood song over it. Then right before it gets to your table the entire restaurant does a rendition of \"Be our Guest\" from Beauty and the Beast as Pamela Anderson and Jenna Jameson deliver it while talking in tongues.   It is that good people.",

    "text": "I have been to C FU many times over the years.   Their Dim Sum is definitely not the best, there are better places for that, but I live near here so it fulfills my cravings sometimes . Also I don't really like the usual Chinese American food\" ie sweet and sour and stuff, but I have tried when other people ordered and it's not that good as far as that goes. What is really good here though and what I go for is their more traditional chinese sea food. They have live fish and lobster tanks which are really good! I like the crab and winter melon soup ( but I'm not sure that is for everyone's taste buds) and I don't know who wouldn't like the lobster E fu noodles! I also really like their snow pea shoots for a side. So in summary, if you are looking for awesome dim sum or good typical American chinese food, this is not the best. But if you are looking for some good fresh chinese seafood and more traditional dishes this place is pretty good! Hope this is helpful!",

    "text": "I had my two sons and their families come to AZ for the Thanksgiving weekend so before they left for home yesterday, they wanted Grandpa to take them to eat dim sum.  Well as we were driving to Phoenix Palace where we normally go, we were talking about perhaps giving C-Fu Gourmet another shot since we had not been there in over two years.  The last couple of times we went to C-Fu the dim sum was pretty bad since they had lost their experienced dim sum chef.  So we decided to give them a shot again.  Upon driving up, we noticed a big banner that gave the new dim sum prices, which were lower since I suspect they are now actively trying to compete with Phoenix Palace, kiddy corner across the street.  To make a long story short, the dim sum was pretty good.  There were some dishes that left something to be desired, but all-in-all, I think they did a good job.  I do have a couple of complaints though --- they have some young people pushing the dim sum carts and I think that is good since they can speak English as opposed to the older women who cannot speak English or understand you.  But even with that capability, I asked the steam cart guy for a steamed dish and he said OK, but we never got it.  Then I asked the fried cart girl to get me a couple of dishes from the kitchen and she said OK but never went back into the kitchen.  So my problem here is with that kind of customer service, I am not sure if I want to come back here again if I cannot get what I want.    But the food was good and so much better than I experienced the last time I was here over two years ago.",

I don't know why they would not want to go to each table and get rid of their items, are ashamed of the food or do they think they are in a race for how fast they can make a lap around the restaurant. There are too many other good dim sum places to go to rather than this one. Don't go here!",

Well, in this instance, I agree more with the Yelp average rating than I do with my Aunt and Uncle... Jared and I really wanted to like this place, but nothing about it was that great.  It has an old school Chinese feel to it, but the food was nothing to write home about... we had an order of egg rolls, wonton soup, chicken with Chinese veggies, and a noodle dish... you'd think something would stand out, but unfortunately, it didn't.

I split an entree with my sister, as the serving sizes are quite large, and it was some of the best Chinese food I've had in quite a while!  My sister and I opted for a vegetable Lo Mein, which came with fried rice, egg rolls and soup, so it wasn't the most extravagant meal, but it was still delicious. The egg drop soup came within seconds of ordering, and was fantastic. The actual entree itself, however, took a little while to come out, especially considering that it was 3pm, and there were only three or four other occupied tables in the place, but it was well worth the wait! To start, the fried rice was the best I've ever had in my life. Ever. It was so good, that we actually ended up ordering another side serving of it, and eating almost all of it! (Keep in mind the portions were huge!) The vegetable Lo Mein was amazing as well. It was cooked to perfection, and not drowning in soy sauce (a personal pet peeve of mine). Overall the experience was very good. The staff was very polite, moved quickly, and the food was excellent! My only complaint would be that they had a very modern radio station playing (something like 101.5) which I found to  be a bit odd. Other than that however, I was quite pleased! I will definitely be returning!",

The dim sum was ok.    My next visit was when I moved here, I came with my parents and my boyfriend again but we came this time at 11am.  Peak dimsum hours and I had such a different experience.  The food was SO good and comparable to the dim sum we had at home (San Gabriel Valley).  Even my parents were impressed.   The dim sum is hong kong parent approved!",

    "text": "There are big problems here.  To some extent they relate to previous problems prior to its recent sale.  The previous owner is an NFL veteran, the Eagles, and has had health issues. Saw him recently and he was doing well and wish him well. He had extreme service issues with staff and it reflected itself in a poor experience. We stayed away for one year. New owner, Peter, 0has led such institutions as Big Wongs, great in its day. We came back in early February for dim sum and then a meal. Both were great. Peter was always around running things. We were so excited my wife and I planned to bring friends for a birthday celebration two weeks hence. We came in last Saturday a week prior to the anticipated party and had a horrible experience-hence two stars. The restaurant was horribly under staffed. There were so many egregious  errors of service that it is not worth enumerating except: 1) the wait staff has poor command of English. It's a Chinese restaurant so understandable but it was handled so poorly. As the wait staff and kitchen got further behind, they tried to convince me a 1 and  1/4  lb lobster was 2 lbs( come from cape cod and I know how to grade lobsters). Further they initially made the dish with shrimp because the waitress did not understand us. When the dish was remade with lobster, they used the same sauce without the shrimp. Unforgivable to compromise the food 2) there appeared to be an expeditor on the floor but he only took care of the Chinese speaking patrons as he did not speak English. Multiple parties walked out because of poor service and nobody cared. One party was openly furious at being ignored in favor of Asian parties but the expeditor did not speak English and ignored them.  Given the uncertainty of the meal we will not have the party as planned. Wouldn't take the chance. To Peter the owner I say: You would not leave the kitchen so I presume you were short help. Better not to open than serve a bad meal with a bad dining experience. If your target audience is Chinese speaking , okay I will stay away as you are not the Peking Duck House on Mott street where adequate staff makes up for any language issues.",

There are no windows in the dining room and the lights were out in the 2/3rds of the dining room not considered \"in use\", which created a dark, depressing environment, perpetuating the otherwise dingy interior. Had I listened to my intuition, I would have left as we waited to be seated, because the service and the food were equally disappointing.  The staff was cold and non-communicative.  The food was inferior, both in terms of poor quality and the bland flavor.  We left feeling that we had completely wasted our money and time.  Never again.",

When dumplings are the main thing to try, make sure your ingredients are fresh and flavorful.  Pungent, rubbery shrimp wrapped in a steam dumpling does not go over well for my nostrils nor my stomach.  The servers in the back pushing the carts are rather aggressive and they swarm to your table like hungry pigeons not stopping a moment to acknowledge that you already order 4 plates.  When declining the dish, they seem upset and then vanish when you want to reorder. The cashier, maybe the new management/owners is very unpleasant.  Not a great way to invite people back and I certainly would not go back for both the food and service.",

I've tried more than a few dishes off the menu, and most are alright. The only standout I can think of is the Shrimp Fried Rice. For some reason, that dish is always cooked up to perfection. Some of the others have been \"meh\" but none of it has ever been downright bad.  But what I really like about C-Fu is their Dim Sum service around lunch time. It's a traditional San Francisco Chinatown style Dim Sum, with carts they push around and everything. Even the look and feel of the dining room reminds me of being back home in the Bay Area. Really cool. And the dim sum is great too. I always end up ordering my favorites, but occasionally I'll branch out and try some new dishes. It's really affordable for the small dishes, so it's easy to try something new.  Overall, I think 3 stars is the correct rating for this place. Their off-the-menu items are hit or miss sometimes. But their Dim Sum service is really great!",

They have the standard dim sum items such as siu mai (they have it in chicken here, which was interesting), steamed bbq pork bun, har gow, and deep fried taro dumpling.  Generally, they all tasted OK, albeit quite oily.  I liked the glutinous rice wrapped with lotus leaf the best.  The most exotic item there today was the tripe, with no sign of chicken feet or congee with preserved egg.  I hear the weekend selection is a lot more diverse though compared to the weekday.  Service was very cheerful and friendly, a bit of a surprise since most dim sum restaurants have servers that usually look at you stony-faced while letting you peruse their carts.   We got 7 different items, with a total of ~$20 with tax.",

    "text": "Can we just talk for a minute about how friggin' good this restaurant is? This place serves plenty of fresh dim sum, has fast service and easy to get in if you come early!  But be warned, we have come just as the doors opened only to miss out on some of the choices when they get busier, so your timing to arrive will influence your choices. What's good about dim sum is that each dish is inexpensive and you can sample a variety of food. C-Fu is always pretty busy but you don't normally wait long to be seated.  This place a good spot for decent dim sum.  They are fast, effective, and your dim comes out nice and steamy.  Service for us was OK,  then again, Chinese restaurants aren't always known for having the best service.  Could I tell you the exact name of our favorites?  No. but their food is amazingly tasty, and fresh! Plus the carts actually come by frequently.  The food is delicious and remarkably affordable!  I haven't been to any other dim sum restaurant here in Arizona, so I can't compare to others, but this once is delicious. The restaurant was nice and spacey    \"the food really good\" but \"I can't remember the name of it\",   Excellent choice for Dim Sum.  Busy place, which keeps the food fresh and the carts moving.  Very reasonably priced, as dim sum should be.   They normally don't serve you, they are usually just there to refill your drinks and give your receipt.  Other than that, they go around with carts and you pick & choose what you want.    FOOD: The food was really good. Unfortunately I can't remember  any of the dishes we enjoyed but we did try a variety of their selections.  We didn't like everything on the menu.  But there were lots of things my wife & I really liked. PRICE: Reasonable. SERVICE:  The carts come around quite frequently which is a good thing. Service is somewhat lacking when it comes to getting drink refills.  I had to constantly flag down a waiter to refill our beverage. Also our servers hardly spoke a word of English.  On a good note while the restaurant was packed, we were seated right away  CONCLUSION: My thoughts on a restaurant of any ethnicity is seeing who eats there, if you see many people from the ethnicity of food you looking for you are usually on the right track this place in that aspect does not lie.  RETURN  FACTOR: 100%. I would come back here when I crave for some dim sum.     ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT",

We ordered about six different plates and they only brought out one small pot of cold white rice. The portions on the plates were about half the size as normal, which is still pretty good, but unexpected. Some of the food was good, but the c-fu house chicken in particular tasted like day old shoe leather. We did order a few additional plates later on and they came out hot and fresh - but still NO MORE RICE. Not only that, but we had to flag down the young waitress several times for refills and she had such a dour, annoyed expression on her face - never once acknowledging our \"thank you's\". All this, and we were only one of two parties left in the ENTIRE restaurant! All the waitresses were circled around the other party, who must've been close friends or family - while we were an afterthought. Hopefully they do a better job next time or it'll be the last time for me.",

    "text": "After having more time to process, I have decided that I won't come back, even for take out lunch. I'd rather have Panda or Pei Wei. A chain where I know what to expect.  I ordered online again and they had to call me because the online order form does not have the options that they claim. The lunch special online says that you get tea, crab puff or egg roll, soup or salad and the entree. They said they were not able to include the tea and when I got there, he said as a courtesy, they included the soup and it doesn't normally come with take out and to order the a la carte entree because it comes with more.   I would argue that it definitely doesn't come with more to do it a la carte. I mean, you get more of the entree, but not everything that it claimed online.  That being said, I will continue on and say even if you're concerned about more or less, it's not that great anyway.  The kung pao had some bell peppers, water chestnuts, peanuts, mushrooms and chicken. The sauce was runny and not spicy.  The crab puff is not a puff, it's a folded over wonton wrapper filled with cream cheese.  The soup was not hot or sour, wreaked of white pepper and tasted like nothing. Didn't really end up eating my courtesy soup after all.  Overall, just not really worth it. You pay a little more than a chain with really nothing to show for it.  I didn't eat inside obviously, but there is not even an ambiance to make up for it. It looks like it is falling apart. There is an automated slider when you walk in that sounds like it is going to collapse, a dirty fish tank, and a dilapidated bar and ball room off to the right. As I waited for my food, I looked at the reviews on the wall, all from about 97-98. When I see this, it usually indicates the place has seen better days, which it probably has.  If you've read my review, I commend you and suggest you spare yourself what I have experienced myself.",
