I'm a big country fan and the thought of dancing the night away to country music got me really excited. Unfortunately, this place sucked. It was a Friday night and it was crowded. The dance floor is SO SMALL!! What kind of country bar has a small dance floor?? We literally walked in, walked to the other side, then walked out. My friend perfectly described the atmosphere as a \"college house party\" where it's crowded, you don't really know anybody and you don't know what to do with yourself. All I saw were people standing tightly next to each other, holding a beer and making conversation. Ugh, I came here to dance!",

We were right. Standing room only. But we noted how much room the patio had where at least 3 hightop tables could have fit to be more accommodating on busy days. We also noted that ZERO staff even spoke to us except the security guy checking IDs. The waitresses were busy, sure, we get that. But to completely ignore two people who were attempting to patronize this establishment (we would've come for every game, tip really well & write Yelp reviews) was plain rude. The waitresses all looked annoyed. We were never asked if we needed anything, never directed to an area of the overcrowded bar where we could order, never told when we could expect a table, never even saw a smile or eye contact. We left a little pissed & won't be returning.",

We waited 20 minutes to have my drink order taken. I asked some questions about the Bellini, and was confident about it, so ordered it. I got it and couldn't taste half of the ingredients--it also was not served as our server describe it would be. Supposedly, they were doing quality assurance follow-ups on the drink, but the server didn't come to check how I liked it for 20 minutes. I waited 30 extra minutes to close my tab with her. Not a great experience, service took too long, and server did not go the extra mile to assure we were 100% satisfied. Won't be coming here with our friends again.",

Their tables have taps built in, yet they hire waitresses that do not drink or know beer and could not give valid descriptions of beer on menu. Everyone ordered dinner. 7 plates arrived together. Last meal arrived TWENTY TWO minutes later, after being told by several employees \"it will be right out\". Because the fish went from frozen to deep fried, it was not good, and was not eaten. Comping that meal was a given. But what about the other seven meals that got cold as we politely awaited the last meal of our party? You couldn't offer a discount? A free round of drinks? Dessert? Nothing?  I assumed this was a country bar with country music, country dancing, and a country atmosphere. Not so much. Every television had the UFC fight on.

We were there for drinks and socialization and for some reason, we were told we could not have a server and had to order our drinks at the bar...??  Alright, Party of 8, without a server at one of the tables along the sidewalk. Awesome.  After a few hours we decided we wanted some food...requested a server for that component...after 20 minutes of waiting, we decided it was time to close out our tabs and go elsewhere since asking one of the many young ladies chatting around the bar to take our orders was a bit too much work...As you can imagine closing 6 tabs (some of our party were couples) took another 20 minutes and finally when the last tab was being closed a server came over to the table...  If you are looking for country music and average drinks to sit on a given afternoon? Sure give it a whirl, the seats are comfy, the girls are nice to look at and the beer is cold.",

    "text": "This place was fun for being a country bar.  Food was ok but the parking, seating & services sucked.   Food: we ordered fried Pickens & southern fries. Pickles were ok- I didn't care for the batter beading though I did love it was pickle spears & not chips.  & the ranch dressing was refreshing.  Southern fries (I think that is what they are called) - well. The chicken was over cooked to the point it was pasty.  The BBQ sauce tasted like cheap Kraft sauce & thank god we got the blue cheese dressing on the side because it was no bueno.    Service: so apparently there was a live band playing so they allowed all tables to be reserved 2 hours before the show.   Those of us wanting a quick but was forced to eat at the bar.  The bartenders took 10 min to take my drink order & charged me $10 for 1 kettle One & soda.  When they denied my food they have it to the wrong person next to us. And when we told them, the server just picked up the food from the other person & have it to us.  Gross.. she touched the food!   Great atmosphere & music but I will not easy there and only drink happy hour specials. Maybe sneak in a flask.",

Glad we did. The entire pickle spear was fried, not sliced like most places. Also, liked the interesting cocktails. We stayed for dinner. The grilled chicken was fantastic. While we aren't big country fans, we did like the music and atmosphere. We'd go back.",

It pretty much is a bar , lots of sports on different TV's, and waitresses wearing barely nothing. The service was ok , I ordered the BBQ Chicken Sandwhich hold the onion rings. I guess if you like food with a little kick then this is your place. The BBQ was good but a little too spicy for me , even the French fries tasted odd.  When it came time to pay we noticed the waitress did not take off the groupon so we had to ask her to re ring the check, which she happily did. Overall not my kind of place , but if you like food with a little kick, loud music and lots of beer, then you will enjoy this place.",

My friend was visiting from Seattle and couldn't get over the beer and liquor taps that are accessible at each table. Initially we sat at the bar but he was anxious to get to a table to enjoy the freedom of pouring his own beer.        Unfortunately there were no tables available so we continued to sit at the bar and enjoy the lively atmosphere. The hostess was aware we were interested in sitting at a table and was keeping us in the loop. We were pleasantly surprised when the manager Courtney came over to us and took us over to a table. She was very friendly and made us feel welcome. We then proceeded to order the grilled cheese and tomato soup and it was delicious!!        We had an awesome bar back named Matt that came over to talk to us and see how we were doing. We appreciated the great and attentive service we received while dining at dierks Bentley. I would highly recommend this restaurant/bar to anyone seeking a highly atmospheric location.",

Great. They also have built in taps for table service. I don't like country music but it was still fun to watch people sing along and dance. For single ladies, there are a lot of really tall guys here.   The bartender we had was fast and attentive. My friend ordered some mudslide shots from another bartender. She stacked the three shots on top of each other, put them on the bar and pushed them towards us. Know your bar surface. Things aren't sliding on that bar top. So I was then wearing those three shots. The bartender took off so fast you'd think her pants were on fire. She didn't say I'm sorry. She didn't offer me a towel. She didn't offer me a drink. She didn't even acknowledge it happened. SO RUDE. Then the guy next to me asked another bartender for a napkin and he yelled back at him sorry dude we ran outta napkins three days ago. Then he came back with one he found, unrolled it in the guys face so the fork and knife dropped right in front of him and tossed it at him. Seriously?  They also ran out of coors light.   So some new bar problems they will overcome but they need to teach some of their bartenders some manners. I don't want to let those two ruin the rest of the experience so 4 stars!",

Complete with a dj booth, elevated dance floor, tables with their own taps (you pay by the oz), and tvs everywhere. The music is constantly playing (and is country obviously).  The menu is great as well, something for everyone. I had the fried pickle burger which was fantastic! Even the fries were especially good: crispy and seasoned just how I like em. They also have a pretty expansive beer menu.  Great place for families with children during the day/afternoon, however, I'm not sure about later at night. The place looks like it could get pretty crazy! For those looking for good night life, this would probably be a good time! They were voted best night life in the area and best country bar. I would definitely go back!  Update:: Went back the next day for dinner and it was every bit of amazing as it was for lunch. Try Dierks Lemonade, one of their signature cocktails... So good! Also, the BBQ pulled chicken sandwich is delicious as well. It seems you can't go wrong here!",

    "text": "I am writing in regards to our most recent visit to your establishment on Feb. 2, 2019.  We travel to Scottsdale every year as a group, and always make it a point to visit (out of our way) Whiskey Row because of the fun atmosphere.  We even made reservations months prior for a table of 10 at 7:30pm.  Upon arrival, we were greeted rudely saying we needed to wait in the \"back of the line\", and only after questioning as to why since we have a reservation would we need to wait in the line to get in, did the security reluctantly let us through.  Upon sitting at our table, we all quickly ordered a round of drinks and requested menus for dinner.  Only then did the supposed general manager, Rudy, come over and rudely and abruptly tell us that the kitchen was closing at 8:00 and we better hurry and get in our food order.  Basically seemingly annoyed we were even there.  I might add, that there were no other parties sitting in the large tables on either side of us.  While waiting for our meals, we continued ordering drinks.  Once our food finally came, Rudy once again made his appearance.  He approached the side of the table where the ladies in our party were sitting.  And he told us we \"need to hurry\" since another party had reserved our table for 9:00.  In no way were we ever informed upon making the reservation that there was any kind of time limit for reserving the table.  I don't feel that 1 1/2 hours is enough time for us to order drinks, order food, wait for our food, and then proceed to eat our food for a party of 10.  Again, Rudy's demeanor was very contemptuous, and condescending to us women at the table when we tried to argue our point. The way he spoke to us was unlike any treatment I have ever received from anyone, let alone a manager in the service industry. He made 2 of my friends actually cry by his arrogant, self important, and downright patronizing attitude toward us.   He then proceeded to tell the waitress to take our food and drinks away (which I might add, we were not even finished with yet).  I find it so ironic that he cowardly neglected to talk the men in our group who were busy in conversation as to what his intent was even though he clearly knew they were paying the bill and actually did walk over to them to collect the payment once our half eaten food was taken away.  On our way out, the security guard that was standing by our table even apologized since he heard the way he was speaking to us.  Not that this should matter, but we are not a bunch of rowdy college kids that just happened to drunkedly come in----we are all professional adults that included doctors, teachers, and owners of companies who spent a lot of money with you.  I read that the CEO of your company, Ryan Hibbert, said \"Hospitality has always been in my blood\", and he enjoys \"giving visitors a place where they feel like they belong and they love what they are experiencing\".  Well he definitely missed the mark here at Whiskey Row by hiring employees like Rudy.  We will never set foot in a Whiskey Row again if this is how the company is run!  And not only that, but I will be forwarding this review on to the corporate offices of RHG Riot Hospitality Group and will be telling everyone I know about this terrible visit!!!",

    "text": "Think to yourself, \"What do you expect from a Dierks Bentley country bar in Scottsdale, Arizona?\" And that's pretty much exactly what I got. I mean, we stopped in mostly to say we'd gone there, and the pure Dierks Bentley country bar magic began to flow right away.  It began with bottle service. We didn't get bottle service, but someone did. In the which, a woman with camouflage shorts and a tight top got on some dude's shoulders, and they walked across the bar floor with some LED lantern and shot off confetti. It was so odd and just goofy but it's exactly what you'd expect from a Dierks Bentley country bar.  Then, the real achievement for the night: the band starts playing. There's a loft (?) above the bar, in the which the band set up the LOUDEST sound your ears will ever bleed to. I dunno what they looked like, though. Because the loft is so far up there, it might as well be a Pandora feed of shouted rock/country, as you'll never ever see them.   The real home run, however, was just after the band started playing and two camo shorts girls got up on the bar to dance. And by dance, I mean, completely and totally go vacant while robotically shifting from side to side. \"Did I turn off the iron?\" one is thinking to herself. \"I wonder if we'll see a rejection of the economic policy suggested by Friedman and his pro free trade positions in favor of protectionism?\" the other one considers as her glassed-over eyes focus on the Scottsdale sky. Bless their hearts, they're very attractive and very over the idea of bouncing on a bar. It was horribly perfect.  This place is a perfect tenner. You have to stop in for like, 10 minutes. It's worth the show. I don't drink, but it looked like they're heavy on the row and light on the actual whisky. It's a well drinks kind of spot. Go in for the ironic profile pic, watch some magic, then get somewhere else where you can hear yourself think, and not sit under the watchful glazed-over eyes of the camo shorts crowd.",

And you aren't going to let me in because letting you know I'm drinking water is rude? Get off your high horse, dude. He then proceeded to act super rude... and look, it's not like this place is hopping - there was hardly anyone in there and I just wanted to come in for a beer and a few country songs.

    "text": "I came to Whiskey Row on Saturday night with a large bachelorette group. We had bottle service and an all around great time front of house. The service was very attentive and they made our bride feel like a rock star. We danced the night away on top of the tables with great vibes and awesome music. They did a fairly decent job of keeping random lurkers off of our table and that's respectable because the place was PACKED. Issues arose when we went to use the restroom and realize the extremely long line was caused from a toilet backup which resulted in sewage flooding the women's restroom. By the time we finally got towards the front of the line we're just about to pee our pants and there's about an inch of sewage...and then we see the bathroom bouncer will only allow females that pay $20 to use the men's stall which is perfectly clean and dry. This was absolutely uncalled for and this man was truly taking advantage of the situation. We told him we weren't paying and we were using the restroom when he tries to apprehend us and calls for an employee on his walkee-talkee. He tells them he needs help \"with some bitches\".  Wrong move. We get mean and mad pretty quickly and at this point the entire line of bathroom folk are revolting against this poorly trained employee. Finally the head manager comes in and handles the situation. After getting a grasp of this nightmare he appropriately delegated and defused the situation. I was really quite impressed because it was a bad situation with a lot of heated, drunk women who needed to PEE! Don't mess with a girl who needs a bathroom. Anyways- the manager came and found me later in the night and bought me a shot and apologized for the nightmare. This was a feat because like I said- place was PACKED. What a nice gesture. We had a fabulous time at Whiskey Row and greatly appreciated his management. Thanks!!! Now get those toilets fixed!!!!",

Then one of the employees said that their manager would love for us to sit in another private booth by the DJ and after sitting for less than five minutes, a couple of very rude and aggressive security guards told us to get out of the booth immediately. I'm not sure why they felt they had to be aggressive considering we were five very petite women. Also, when we were out on the dance floor, I was pushed or nudged very hardly by the security guards to make me get out of their way. I understand if they need to be somewhere, but a simple tap on the should would suffice.  I was really excited to come here and it started out great but after being treating like trash by the security I wouldn't ever want to come back here. Like what's the point of inviting us to another booth only to have us kicked out immediately. We just went back to our original booth but still. It was pointless and frustrating. And the security need to learn how to treat other people. Especially women. I don't think I'll be returning and I wouldn't recommend it either.",

I've eaten some of their food items that were good but overpriced in my opinion. This bar is just a kick ass atmosphere and there's nothing like it in Old Town.   The one bad experience I had was when I had an attack of my movement disorder while out one night at Whiskey. The bouncers and manager handled it so unprofessionally. They couldn't get me out fast enough when I just needed a minute. I understand the liability but a little compassion would have gone a long way than just treating me as if I was drunk.",

But overall, the bar is awesome, cool atmosphere, cool crowds, etc. The staff could be better... not impressed by the staff or service.",

This time the location was Whiskey Row, which boasts bottomless mimosas and a yummy menu.  My favorite part of the experience was the huge booth which easily fit our large party. A welcome reprieve from the crazy too-packed atmosphere that I've experienced on weekend nights. I ordered the egg white omelet, which was protein filled, if a little greasy. The mimosas were good to start, though seemed to be mostly orange juice when the refills came around. Please don't skimp on the champagne next time Dierks!  All in all our group had a good time, and it was a good start to this week's Sunday Funday.",

Happy Hour offerings were priced perfectly. In fact the entire menu looked great. I started with a bleu cheese bacon slider ... Omg melt in your mouth. As an entree I chose the Fingers and Strings which was the best wings and onion rings I have had in forever. My friend ordered the ribs. Cooked perfectly with a side of bacon mashed potatoes they were amazing. A few drinks... And off to the concert. Will definitely get back to this place !",

Went to Dierks for a buddy's birthday. Group of 10, east to get reservations, great table set up. Service was very slow which is even expected at a busy place- but our appetizer took 47 minutes. Spinach an artichoke dip! We asked the server if she was sure she placed the actual order because everyone else at the table received and had already eaten their appetizers at this point. She tells us \"there were 30 orders of dip ahead of yours\".....um...yeah right. No one in the surrounding tables was eating this dip FYI. The long awaited dip: gross. It comes in a mini skillet but it was cold...like sour cream cold. Not sure if this was supposed to be warm. It tasted like it came from a freezer and they microwaved it to thaw it out. Blah.   Food: I ordered the grilled cheese and soup; greasy. Nothing else to say. Fiance ordered the mushroom burger: greasy but no other complaints. Others at the table seemed to think their food was \"greasy, but okay\" as well.   Drinks: Smutty nose is delicious. It's $11 so it's somewhat worth the cost.    Pros: fun atmosphere, good music (if you like country music), busy but not annoyingly packed; great bathrooms; good cocktails   Cons: service is not great (slow and not always accurate); food is low quality and greasy  Overall: probably wouldn't ever come back here with so many other options literally next door.",

The server listed way too many drinks they were out of, and when we made a comment, she said this was better than any of the other nights. Then she threw out a comment saying they haven't been carrying most of the drinks on the menu. Again, it's a Tuesday night. I suggest they re-print their menu with the drinks they actually do have, and spell \"Dos Equis Ambar\" correctly. Also, my friend ordered a Dierks Dram, hence their name, and the server came back saying they were not able to make that because they're out of bourbon. As I'm typing this, bartender came by and we thought he was gonna say they were out of another drink, but instead said their French 75 has a strong whiskey taste so he wanted to make sure \"the drink wasn't for a girl.\" French 75 does not have whiskey in it and how offensive was that comment?!!! How is this place open?!???",

    "text": "Never been to a Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row before. As I am a fan of him, thought I'd try it. I was told they have games there too like corn hole, life size checkers, etc. Well, not the case at this location. Apparently, the Tempe location has games but not here. Wanting to hangout and have fun while eating today a little disappointed. I'm not sure why one location has things that others don't. But, I stayed and ordered food. I ordered the kale and quinoa salad ($9). You can add chicken for $4 but I chose not to. I misread the menu an s thought it said grape tomatoes. Not the case, it was real grapes. I picked them out and filled a whole plate with them. Ugh. It was already covered in lemon dressing that was good. However, they then cover it in pesto as well. Complete dressing overload. It was supposed to have mix greens too. I guess one, yes literally one (see the picture) piece of romaine lettuce is considered mixing other greens in too. Lol! Oh, and the quinoa was no where in sight. The manager stopped by to ask how the food was and I asked him if the salad was supposed to have quinoa. He said yes it's in there. I eat quinoa often, it wasn't there. I paid $9 for basically drenched kale with probably 2 tiny pieces of feta. Rip off. My daughter ordered chicken fingers and fries. I took a bite. The chicken outside batter was delicious. Unfortunately, the meat was so dry that I struggled to swallow the one bite and she only ate her fries and struggled to finish just 1 chicken strip out of 5. She asked for BBQ sauce to try to help with the dryness. That tasted sour so she didn't go beyond one dip. Then when I got the bill I realized that I was charged $0.50 for the BBQ sauce. Considering your ordering chicken strips and usually people use sauce especially BBQ, I was confused. But hey it's $0.50 so I just blew it off. The caveat was a 'tech fee' of 3% of your bill that I was charged. Due to my bill it was only $0.74.  When I asked the server what that was I was told that it was for their computer systems. Why should I be charged or have to pay for their computer systems? I'm there to eat food. Again, confused. I paid the bill and when the server brought my change back she handed me the book with it. Well, she shorted me $1.75. I will NEVER go back there. Not only was I charged for ridiculous items but I was robbed. What a waste of money.",

They've got special dishes for fairly cheap on Happy hour that are different to their normal appetizers. Last time we were here we got the small mac and cheese and the bbq wings. The mac and cheese was pretty good, not a lot of cheese sauce. I'm not sure what kind of cheese they use, but it wasn't very sharp or pungent which may be good depending on your tastes. We've shared the regular wings before but went for the bbq wings this time, but both agreed we prefer the regular wings. The BBQ sauce wasn't our favorite (bit sweet) and the regular wings are \"naked\" with the sauce on the side.  One of my favorite reasons for coming here is that they have Magic Hat #9 in bottles, which not many places have it. Hopefully they don't take it off the bar menu like Zipps did late last year! Overall, great place for happy hour, especially if you love country music! The food I've had here is pretty good for bar food. I saw someone bring their dog here too which is nice to see a dog friendly bar!",

    "text": "Although I am not a country fan, I hauled my family from Mesa into Scottsdale to try out Whiskey Row because I heard the food was good and there was an available Groupon. We arrived at the restaurant just as Happy Hour was starting and it was near-empty. We sat down at an enormous camouflage-upholstered banquette table that made King Arthur's Round Table seem puny. My mom, brothers, and I practically had to shout across the table to each other, and when our appetizers arrived, we had to slide them back and forth like an air hockey puck. There are also 4 beers on tap right at your table (a cool touch, but we were not drinking at the moment), so we had to negotiate our food around this island, too.       I was pleasantly surprised that we could get the Happy Hour specials with our Groupon. We ordered a lot of scrumptious appetizers, as well as entrees. We had the fried pickles which came with a creamy cucumber ranch sauce that I could have licked out of the cup. I also had a picnic chicken slider, which was to die for in its fried chicken perfection. To bask in more fried chicken heaven, we also had chicken fingers and rings, as well as wings. All delicious!        For my main dish, I had a whiskey burger with extra whiskey bbq sauce. You can actually taste the whiskey. The jalapenos were a nice touch-spicy, but they didn't kill me. I opted for the side salad, which was underwhelming.        I gave my brother my leftover half of my burger so I could save room for dessert, which I split with my mom. We ordered the banana bread pudding. It is one of the best desserts I have eaten in a long time. The bread pudding was melt-in-your mouth with chocolate chips and a creme brulee finish. It was accompanied by vanilla bourbon ice cream. Again, you could taste the bourbon, which I really enjoyed.        The only draw back was the ambiance. At night, this place seems like it might become a college hangout. I'm not opposed to that, but it probably gets quite loud.      All in all, this was a delicious dining experience, and I am excited that a Whiskey Row will be opening in Chicago very soon.",

I have lived in Phoenix for 17 years and also work at a bar in Old Town. Came here because the crowd was good and music and we were just bar hopping. Went up to an open space in the bar to get a couple drinks..had my credit card out and waited. From what I could see there were 2 girl bartenders that night and it was a pretty busy night for a Wednesday. I'm in the industry so I totally understand being busy and not getting to me right away...no big deal...but what I don't understand is the bartender making drinks for another person RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME ....looks RIGHT AT ME. I smile and wait since I figured she looked at me so she knows I'm waiting. But she does no sort of ackowkedging of me or \"I'll be right with you\" or \"hey I'm so sorry I'm super slammed but I will be right back\" Nothing. I understand if other people were before me and she needs to serve others before me...great...just let me know..all I got was a bartender with a shitty attitude and look on her face...I've worked in Old Town for years and KNOW how busy it gets especially in season...but I also know how to give good service and acknowledge people even when I am busy. If you can't handle it or don't like it..then don't work there. Little did she know I'm a great tipper but after being repeatedly ignored I didn't want her getting any of my money. I can't stand people in the industry that act like that and plus its just super unattractive women who act like that. However the bartender Jordan at Dakota was AMAZING. She was sooo sweet and nice and personable. Their music and vibe was great.",

Took about ten minutes before a legitimate country artist was played on a Saturday night. Drinks are pricey and good whiskey is (smaybe not surprisingly) completely absent from the liquor menu. New mMs for the bar may be \"Bad 80's Hits brings you Cheap Beer\".   Sorry Dierks, your bar gets two stars.   Plus side: anyone looking for a non-country bar with humans drinking alcohol can find that here on the weekends.",

I asked for one tv to be changed to the Cardinals game and the manager said no because the Broncos game was on. So if you come for football and your wanting to watch a game at the same time the Broncos are playing, forget about it. It's an unfortunate situation that alienates all other football fans... If only playing one team on all TV's wasn't an issue it would be a 5 star rating from me.",

Sat down and ordered a drink and then were told we needed to finish our drink and leave because no one under 21 was allowed in!!!! ( my friend and I are late 30's, not talking about us....haha)  I would never take my daughter to a club, obviously, but thought this was a restaurant and saw no problem with taking my daughter here for a lunch and some good music.

    "text": "I am writing this review in regards to an event that happened Saturday evening, February 2, 2019, at Whiskey Row, Scottsdale, Arizona. Problem#1 A group of 10 of us had made reservations months in advance for dinner in your restaurant at 7:30 that evening. When we arrived on time, we were asked to go step in a line and wait for our table. However, we let the front know that we had reservations and we're not quite sure why we were not being sat at the time that we had reserved. We were sat about 12 to 15 minutes later than our reservation. Shortly after that, our waitress came to the table and took our drink orders.  Problem#2  Soon after we received our drinks we were told, by our waitress, that we had to order, our food quickly because the kitchen closes at 8 o'clock. (Why would a restaurant take dinner reservations at 7:30, if the kitchen closes at 8:00. Would you not make your patrons aware of this at time of reservations, or not allow reservations after a certain hour?) We placed our orders and waited for our food.  Problem#3 The 10 of us received our meals,  maybe 10 to 15 minutes after getting our food, I had noticed your manager approach one of our friends at the end of the table, pulling her aside to let her know that we needed to hurry, as the table is reserved at 9 o'clock for bottle service. However, the manner in which he was speaking to her was disrespectful and quite frankly, Rude. Why would he chose to speak to the woman at the end of the table, who had nothing to do, with paying the bill? I find it cowardly, why would he choose to only approach her instead of allowing the whole table to know, that we needed to exit as the table, as it was was reserved. I noticed my friend's  face, as she was visibly upset.  I got up and went over to join her as our husband's were eating and drinking, and did not notice Rudy, speaking to my friend. The manner in which he spoke to her in my opinion was degrading, abrasive, cowardly, and disrespectful to women, for someone who is in a managerial position. As a person who runs her own business and does practice management as a living, his behavior was sub par and deplorable. Had this been one of my employees, he would've been fired. The way in which he chose to speak  to me, as I tried to defend my friend, was just as unsettling, I began to cry. I am not a crier. I am tough and I can hold my own. I have never been treated so horribly in my adult life. When I tried to touch his arm, to get him to calm down. He held his arms up, acting as if I was attacking him. This is laughable. He then proceeded to walk over to our husbands, and had the audacity, to ask my husband to pay the check. The first thing my husband asked him was, why is my wife crying? My wife never cries. He gave him some poor excuse, and my husband paid the check and we all got up and left. Had he explained to us that it was some corporate policy, for your company to make money on bottle service, (may I point out that the tables around us were completely empty) We would have gladly had our table pay for the bottle service. We were not made aware of this until after the fact. Not only that, not one of us, got to finish our Meals. The table was cleared and we were asked to leave. I will never return to your establishment again. I work with the public every day, I could understand if we were being disorderly or obnoxious or not ordering drinks or refusing to pay for our meal , however none of this happened. I feel like this event is very discriminating, I feel it is very unprofessional, and I would hope that you will take this into consideration when reading my review, as I will be posting this review to TripAdvisor, Google, Yelp and to your corporate webpage. My friends, will also be posting the same reviews. With a company so large and with Dierks Bentley's name attached to your company, I would hope that you would train your managers and your staff to treat people with respect. I would hope in this day and age, that whoever is doing the hiring, would look for these qualities in employees. I hope this helps with any decisions, when hiring employees in the future. The 10 of us will never return to your restaurant again. May I make some suggestions? Make your patrons aware of your policies, if you would rather run as a night club, don't take dinner reservations, for 7:30, and not have a open kitchen. Train your staff to handle tough situations, or hire people capable of dealing with the public. I implore you to implement some of these suggestions, when making decisions as what to do in the future.",

We asked the hostess to be put on a wait list for a table because we wanted to get some food and drinks. There were 4 or so tables open and she said they had some reservations but there was a 20 minute wait but because we were part of the taco crawl we couldn't have a table. I explained again that we wanted to buy food and drinks, our 2 little tacos we had at other stops were not enough and we wanted to try this place. She told us we absolutely could not be on the list because they don't give tables to taco crawl people. They clearly have enough business don't want my business. I don't understand why they even participate in the crawl if they don't want people to spend money at their establishment. They shouldn't even sign up.",

The chicken nuggets and the fried pickles which are mentioned alot in the reviews,  then the sliders because the chicken nuggets and fries pickles were very good! Our waitress was there pretty quickly!! Made us feel welcome and offered lots of suggestions on the menu. We also noticed that the age groups varied from middle aged to the young which was nice.

Also don't ever buy bottle service because they have to lock the bottles....and you have to find your waitress to come unlock them and give everyone drinks, and good luck finding the waitress on a Friday or Saturday night.  Good music, cool atmosphere, but sub par service almost every time! Not sure why....understaffed or unengaged staff....",

It was the best bar in Old Town. There was good live country music, actual country dancers, the girls that worked here didn't have sleazy lingerie up their buttcracks... but all that has changed.  The half country half pop crap they play is so bad it makes my ears bleed. Like nails scratching a chalkboard, just awful. Now the crowd is just like many other old town clubs- younger and douchey. So not a country bar. So not what it used to be.",

I was totally amused by the dancers on the bar who either look really bored or like they hate their lives. It's also a spectacle when the servers bring out the bottles for the tables with bottle service. The servers (women) were holding bottles with sparklers while riding on the shoulders of men. Were these guys the bouncers or were they hired specifically just to carry the girls on their shoulders? Lol. I love country music though, so I was digging the uptempo beats on top of my favorite pop country songs. Whiskey Row also plays top 40, so I thought that there was a decent mix of songs I heard while I was there.",

Only reason for the 4 star is cause the wings were slightly dry and the bbq sauce was a little salty but that's just preference!",

So my friend and I came one early evening I think it was a Friday afternoon and it wasn't packed for the night yet of course. I'm not going to lie. I sort of judged especially it being by/on frat row. My friend and I sat at the bar and Morgan was super nice and suggested food for us. We ordered the sliders and boy were they amazing. We asked her where they would be showing the Mayweather McGreggor fight. She said right there! Of course right?! So next day rolls around and we get there super early to eat beforehand. Oh yeah food was super good. Beer, good!!! Lol. Morgan was very attentive as well as Chloe. So if you remember the Mayweather McGreggor fight took forever to start so we were literally there for hours. By that time our asses were sore from those seats at the bar. My friend and I were expecting to pay $50 to watch the fight and they didn't charge anything for females! Sweet! Pays to have a vagina! Lol. Had a fun time here with good service. Will be coming back here when I visit!",

Although this is western themed, you do not have to dress in the garb. Any outfit will due. I never drink whisky so asked the bartender to serve me his favorite and even though I do not like whiskey, I really enjoyed the drinks. This bar is the first bar that I have seen where there are taps on each of the tables so you are able to serve yourself as much (or as little) beer  as you would like (it automatically calculates the total based on how many ounces are served). Also, the tables double as games so you can drink eat and play at the same time.",

    "text": "Let me first preface some of my comments. I am a huge Dierks Bentley fan and actually flew out from DC to AZ to meet with some friends who surprised me by reserving a table and coming out to Whiskey Row. I not only wanted to like this bar, but I wanted to LOVE IT! Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high, or perhaps since I went on opening weekend (July 5th) some of the kinks hadn't been hashed out.   We reserved a table for 10pm- which me and my friend's husband were eager to try to the beer tap that came with the table. We were a bit early so we went to the bar to order a drink. I looked at the beer list which was decent but by no means extensive. I was told that they were out of the beer that I ordered (First weekend open and you're already out of stock...?) so I simply ordered another beer. Drinks were reasonably priced with beer being around $6 a glass. Coming from DC, this seemed fairly reasonably priced.   We were brought to our table where the waitress explained to us how the table would be charged. We had a $200 minimum and then would be charged for and then anything else purchased (either bar drinks or from the tap) would be added on top of that price. There is a electronic monitor that is supposed to identify for your how much you are spending. Unfortunately, a couple of things at our table weren't working. The electronic monitor was tracking someone else's table and our table tap didn't work, which to us, eagerly wanting to use the tap, made the table far less appealing. I requested that we could be released from the table obligation given the issues, but we weren't allowed to but they did reduce our minimum down to $150, although we made the price up by not being able to track the cost of our spending with the broken monitor.   So there's the bad, but there is PLENTY of good. The atmosphere and setup is great. The band on top of the bar was amazing. The music was live and all country. Totally topnotch. Perhaps a bit too loud, but I think that'll eventually get sorted-out. The table (if it was working) was fun especially since it was Foosball table.   Overall it was fun--- I'd go back and try it again. However, given the issues, I'd probably forgo the table.",

This place is surprisingly smaller than I thought it would be or maybe I didn't expect there to be that many people...all people under 30 years old. The food...everything on the menu looked good. But after a week of fried foods, I decided to have \"Veggie Row\" which consisted of raw and streamed veggies, hummus and a chick pea concoction...all on a school lunch tray...I'll post a picture. My husband ordered some sort burger that was considered a speciality because of it's sauce...but it didn't come out with any sauce and when he asked the waitress about it she said \"it's supposed to have sauce on it\" and then she just stood there...my husband said \"well, can I get some sauce on the side now?\" My teenage daughter seemed a bit uncomfortable in the place and when I asked how she liked her fried pickle burger she said \"this place reminds me of a country Hooters\"....very well described.",

    "text": "So we got there at opening on a Saturday morning at 10 AM. We were there for brunch. They weren't ready for us. They were still cleaning from the night before there was cleaning supplies sitting everywhere and they were filling helium balloons right near our table which was very loud and distracting. We asked for two of their signature big ass bloody Mary's for $12 apiece and the bar was not ready to make them as they were still cleaning and prepping for the afternoon bar rush. We got them about 20 minutes later without much of the fruit or olives - which came later. The Bloody Mary's are their own specialty concoction, and while I love a great Bloody, I could live the rest of my life happily without having this one again!  $24 for two regular sized strange tasting Bloody Mary's.   For breakfast we had the big ass breakfast for nine dollars and this breakfast was terrific. The eggs were done right bacon is crispy and  it was very good and came out quickly. We asked for salt pepper and they had one set in the restaurant and it came out to the table covered in some red sticky substance that was very gross. We had them clean them off and we got them back about five minutes later.   Overall it seemed like their brunch was a very forced affair and that they really didn't even want us there as they still had a lot of work to do to get the bar ready for another evening of country-western heavy drinking party fun.   As a clue to us, we were the only patrons in the restaurant for the 45 minutes that we were there.  Our question is, why even have a breakfast?",

I'm a foodie so I was really disappointed (the menu sounded really good with creative items, they just tasted awful). The drinks were better and reasonably priced.   We came back another night to see if it would be a better experience than happy hour, which it was. They had a really fun band that night and the stage is above the bar so it was pretty cool. It was definitely crowded so my only complaint would be the lack of space. There were hardly any tables, so I would think there would be more space for standing and walking but there really wasn't. People were constantly running into me. All in all, I'm sure I will return, as I enjoyed the band, atmosphere (for the most part), and location.",

The food is super good surprisingly, i got the bbq chicken and potato salad. BOMB.   If you get bottle service they have beer taps on the tables, and better yet they have hard alch on tap too. Once table has goose...on tap.... sickest thing ever.   The lines are insanely long, but that should shorten as time goes by so definitely check this place out.",

This is a country bar with live country music bands that play every now and then.  Great thing about this place is the location, smack dab in the middle of old town Scottsdale's nightlife.    They also have a ton of tvs to view any event from any angle in the the bar including a 2 story projection screen on the back wall.    Food is your typical bar food with a hint of country style.  Good meat selection with the traditional BBQ flavors.  Overall good food considering the options around the area but a little higher in price than I would like to see.  However, if you check in here, you get a free appetizer for the table so take advantage while it lasts.    I give 4 stars for being an awesome place to host the Denver Broncos.  Minus 1 point for being slightly overpriced and at times very difficult to get to the bar to buy drinks when it is busy.",

I guarantee many fake id's were being used.   We were there for a bachelor/bachelorette party.  We were kicked out of our table because they said they had other reservations but the tables sat empty and we had to to stand on the patio. Weird considering we were spending money. Don't waste your money on mixed drinks. Over $10 a pop and just a splash of liquor. Stick with beer.   This place was a major disappointment.  If I were Deirks Bentley, I wouldn't want my name on it.  We'll go back to Cave Creek or the west side for a REAL country bar.  Sad because it could be a fun place.",

    "text": "Colleagues and myself had lunch here before leaving PHX a few days ago...we walked in to find only a couple of tables occupied -that might have been the first clue, however it was already around 12:30 pm on a Thursday so we gave them the benefit of the doubt on that one.  The hostess turned out to also be the waitress and the bartender because apparently there was no one else around. It took a good 15-20 minutes before we were able to order drinks, then it took another 15 minutes before they showed up, and that was after I told her we were on a tight deadline to get to the airport.   We ordered the fried pickles as appetizers - HORRIBLE barely describes them. They had been fried earlier and apparently stuck in the microwave to warm up because the coating was rubbery and greasy. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich - 2 small pieces of grilled chicken with barely a smear of buffalo sauce, the fries - no exaggeration here, had clearly been fried earlier and dunked in oil again. They were oil soaked and dark and definitely not fresh.  The only item that looked vaguely decent was the Quinoa salad, however, one of the girls didn't get her shrimp with it as she ordered and it wasn't until she was done eating that they showed up - they were kind enough not to charge us for them.  Overall very disappointing  - service was lacking, food was bad, not a place I ever plan to set foot in again.  I think Dierks should probably stick to music and leave the food to someone else!",

Dont get me wrong, I'll listen to it, I'll sing along to it, and I'll drink whiskey from the bottle like a country girl......... but the crowd at this place. omg.  I wanted to murder whoever invented plaid. WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?! If it wasnt some white boy wearing plaid and boots (some of them attractive, yes) It was some strange girl in a mini skirt, and a sparkle tube top... what? Also, I had never seen a rhinestone belt, before this outing. I am thoroughly confused. Its got a very hick-LA feel if you ask me. lol  Anyways, this place was PACKED on a friday, and I loved the live band. I didnt love the drunk girls trying to two-step ontop of my feet, but was so entertained by the chaos that is WR I didnt complain too much. The service here can be a little slow, because it is so busy, but I guess you cant fault the bar for that.  I wouldnt come here for a mellow drink with a friend, but if you want to get blacked out drunk and wake up in a strangers bed the next morning... I think that this is the place for you.",

    "text": "Being a huge fan of Dierks, I had been wanting to come to Whiskey Row in Scottsdale for some time.  I finally made it out this past weekend, even booked a hotel room.  Loved the way it looked and think the taps at the tables are beyond cool.   This is where my positive review ends.  We came around 6 p.m. to grab a bite, sample the atmosphere and get a drink or two and maybe settle in for the night.  The hostess told me that they were expecting a large party so they weren't seating anyone but we were welcome at the bar.   It must have been a really BIG party because there were a lot of open seats.  Anyway, after standing at the bar for over 15 minutes trying to get the attention of one of the two bartenders or any of the waitresses walking by, we couldn't get any service, not even a drink.  We finally decided to go to El Hefe and Wasted Grain and gave them our money they were more than willing to take.  My friends and I were so wanting to find a place to meet up once a month.  Sadly, it won't be at Whiskey Row.  It's a shame because I have never before written a bad review and I wanted so much to enjoy Whiskey Row but how do you enjoy a place that won't even acknowledge that you exist?",

    "text": "I would consider myself a bit country, and enjoy a good country bar.  Although Toby Kieth's I love this Bar and Grill is a little mainstream, I would consider it my favorite.  I had a lot of expectations because of Toby's, none of which were met.  I should have turned around and left when I got to the bar, ordered a Bud Light and a shot of Jack, and she laughed and said \"we don't like Bud Light here\".  I told her I didn't care what she liked, and she said \"we don't have any Budweiser here\".  HUGGGHHHHHHH?!?!  I get beer contracts and distributorships, but not having Budweiser at a country bar??  I grabbed my Coors Light, against my wishes, and took a walk.  I didn't find much that even came close to impressing me.    I found a tiny, and I MEAN TINY dance floor in the back which doubles as a main walkway to get in and out of the bathrooms.    The main bar in the middle is packed and lacks proper staffing.  It's almost too big.  The crowd is the standard, typical Scottsdale crowd that don't know squat about country, that probably wondered over from one of the other trendy hotspots.  There were more affliction t-shirts and high heels than button ups and cowboy boots.  Even the bartenders could use a lesson in western/country attire.  I couldn't tell who was out of place, the bar or the people.  There was a DJ mixing today's country hits.  Yes, I said mixing.  It's Scottsdale, what do you expect?  We were there for a birthday and had a reserved table, which do have taps in which you can pour your own beer....pretty cool.  However a majority of the space on the sides of the bar was taken up by these VIP tables.  Not ideal, by any means.  Overall I would never go back to this place.  I love Dierks and would have hoped he would have cared more about what he puts his name on, but the bar was packed and he obviously reaps the benefits of a full house.  Although the bar itself looked somewhat cool (if it were empty), it missed the whole country theme that Toby's has nailed.  If you want country (or Bud Light) stay far away.  Sorry Dierks.",

We came in for after dinner drinks on a Wednesday. It wasn't super crowded just a few people at the bar, but the space is huge. You can sit indoors at high top tables or booths, there is a huge bar and there is also outdoor seating. Above the bar is a stage that has live music on weekends. The DJ was bumping some great country music so that was fun.  There are TVs around the bar to watch sports and the decor is very rustic and country feeling. You definitely feel like you're in the south when you're here. I would love to see what it's like on a more crowded night, it seems like it could be fun.",

At first, everything was fine, besides only questioning if we had a waiter to begin with because no one came over for about 10 minutes! However all the sudden things went downhill quickly. Everyone's food was brought out except one dish, my salad! I sat there for so long that everyone in my party was finished with their food before I got my salad. When the salad finally came, it wasn't as I had ordered it and the waitress offered to remake it. She took it back. When she returned, she aggressively asked if everyone else's food at the table was okay, then stared me personally straight in the eyes so rudely that I looked away and with an EXTREMELY rude and disrespectful hateful tone asked me if I was happy with my salad. The moment this interaction happened it churned my stomach upside down and I lost my appetite from the aggressive and rude behavior. I didn't even finish my salad because the waitress verbally attacked me and we immediately asked for checks and left the establishment. Horrible service, I have never been treated like this by any restaurant!",

Ended up with an impressive Mac and Cheese burger. It was that creamy style mac which was laddled thick and a solid well done burger. The onion rings were good, but better when reheated and crispy in my oven. My last beer bottle was three bucks, but my other drafts were like $5, so either she never told me the beer special or undercharged me. Either way, made it out of there for the fireworks.

I am so sad and disappointed because I attend the other locations frequently and have never had worse service. We even went to the bar to order shots and the bartender frequently rolled her eyes at us.   If their employees decide to pull the sticks out of their asses, I may consider going back. Until then, I'll stick to what I know, the Gilbert location.",

We were told oldtown scottsdale was a great area to go have some fun .we go to the first place we see that had  a lot of buzz and beautiful woman . We enter the restaurant and we were sat at a table . We ordered about 12 drinks and after that ... Not ONCE did a waitress come stop back at our table , she skipped our table deliberately and went to the two other tables next to us . We've tried to call out multiple waitresses but they all gave us the cold shoulder. Without trying to make a scene we just left and went to another location where they welcomed us with open arms and took our money happily and gave us vip service ..  Btw we are Hispanics from Los Angeles . This is the first time we've ever encountered racism at a club or restaurant . It's disgusting and they should be ashamed",

    "text": "I happened to stumble past a picture of this bar before our recent trip to Phoenix and immediately looked up reviews. While we were travelling with my parents, the menu looked delicious and it seemed like a unique place to visit. Quite a few people had recently mentioned purchasing a Groupon and so I checked and it was thankfully still available.  Parking was easy for us to find, but it was a Friday at about 12 noon. There are select street spots available but plenty of parkades around per the mall. We were immediately seated and had our choice of booth/table/bar options. We went for a booth for the unique tap service. Unfortunately it wasn't working and the booth was so large we all just crammed down at the end to be able to see/hear each other. It also wasn't the cleanest with dust and mystery debris all over it, but the wall decor and ample tvs are there to keep your eyes busy. I had read about the unisex washroom sinks and had a chuckle as I was at one point joined by a gentleman who wasn't aware and quickly and awkwardly finished zipping up his pants. I made sure my parents were aware for no such surprises for them.  The food here is amazing and wonderfully covers all dietary wishes. My husband loves mac and cheese and there it was. My mom prefers healthy options and went for a chicken wrap with a side of brocolini. My dad and I opted for burgers and the mushroom swiss burger was the best I might have ever had. The lemon arugula made the dish. I tried the deviled potato salad and found it quite good. You need a mint after but it hit the flavours perfectly.  If you check in through Yelp, you also get a free appetizer. We went for the fried pickles as they were most likely to be a hit with the table. We received 5 little spears in a stack, with a delicious ranchy dipping sauce. While they were good, at a reg price of $6, I might recommend skipping them as you're not really getting your money's worth.  Overall, this was the most memorable and enjoyed meal during our trip. My mom talked of it daily and we would have been better off to have enjoyed each meal here. I wouldn't hesitate to return for a meal or to enjoy a little honky tonk fun!!",

Fun environment but on a busy Saturday night they only had 4 bartenders working. 30 minutes went by and we still hadn't even got a drink yet. We just stood there at bar waiting and waiting to get a bartender, nothing! The actual bar itself is huge so that leaves hardly any standing room for guests so everywhere I stood felt like I was in a walk way.  We called our party bus driver and told him this place wasn't for us and we left to another place that ended be much more fun, roomier and quick to get a drink in hand.",

The J.I.M.B.O. was good and served in a mason jar glass.  It didn't taste like there was any alcohol in it, so switched to a beer when it was gone.  The Chips and Dip were delicious!  We also tried the Corn Dogs...expected to receive mini corn dogs, but there were 3 actual corn dogs on the plate with 2 types of mustard and ketchup.  They were really good!  For dinner I had the Grilled Cheese with Tomato Soup.  The Grilled Cheese had 3 different cheeses (American, Provolone and Goat) and I ordered the candied bacon for an additional charge.  Totally worth it!  The soup was tasty...not a plain tomato, but a creamy tomato soup with some cheese on top.  My dining companion ordered the Bad Ass Bloody and the Strawberry Shortcake for dinner.  The Bloody was served with a slider on top.  It's a great concept, but the drink had an over abundance of celery salt in it and wasn't finished.  Overall, I enjoyed the experience.  It's nice place.  I would have preferred to sit at one of the booths...they have taps on the table that I would have liked to try out!  I would definitely go back.",

Great customer service, drinks were well made, the food was not bad, but also wasn't very good. The decor was great. They didn't overcrowd the place inside which I enjoyed a lot, but it also left a huge line outside waiting to get in so get there early. I've gotten bottle service all over the country and would never ever get if here: the tables themselves have a ginormous metal slab table in the middle forcing you to slide almost 10 feet around it and then you're stuck there, the table is so massive you can't interact with the other people at your table and most importantly there's no room to dance, or interact or do anything except sit there behind this huge table. They also open up the entire place to the outdoor elements meaning if it's over 100 outside its over 100 while in there. Also, the identity of the bar patrons were very odd: you had some folks whose were there for the country scene then some who were there for the club and don't like country making the vibe way too weird and lame.",

The first one is delicious and the rest taste like pure orange juice.

Then a few more rounds of blasting a Don Henley song that could be heard for miles. Add in the sound staff walking around the restaurant yelling at each other and it was very unpleasant.   Suggestion?  I know this needs to be done but do this kind of speaker check/sound check before paying customers arrive for lunch.",

    "text": "I think I died and went to country heaven!!! Came here during spring training. We actually grabbed drinks DURING a Giants game, and the place was pleasantly comfortable, with great music playing. Drinks were relatively inexpensive, and apparently, when you have a ticket from a Giants game, you get your first beer free-ish. There was a DJ playing and by the looks of it, it gets a little rowdy. Only way I would want to add to this place would be some corn hole to generate some competition and conversation. They have digital beer taps at tables sitting around the center bar, which of course, has a dance floor ABOVE it. Super fun bar, I will be back for sure very soon. It may even be the location of my bachelor party. I will definitely be back when I am in Scottsdale again, and quite possibly another trip just to swing by again.",

Very unique way of serving these, as the wing had both the drumette and the wingette left attached as one piece.  They were crisp and just the right level of spice.  We then had a burger and a buffalo chicken sandwich.  Both were great options.  We had the deviled egg salad and the brussel sprout slaw.  Unique and tasty sides.  We will definitely come back to watch a game sometime, as the food is much better than the typical bar.",

What many people don't understand is that Dierks Bentley doesn't own this restaurant (well, maybe less than 5% of it), just like Mr Wolfley doesn't own Wolfies. The names are bought like brands to bring in customers. Im not sure about Toby Keiths, but I do know they are very family friendly and one is opening up in Peoria on Northern and Loop 101 before the fall. I hope JD and his family will visit and enjoy.",

When we were seated, we were handed a regular menu and a happy hour menu. When the waitress arrived to the table she said happy hour was unavailable. We questioned because our reservation was canceled for Friday night and the deal for tonight's now reservation was that happy hour would still be honored. The manager was great and honored that, but I was highly disappointed when my bill came to table. Thursday nights \"special\" included \"$4\" Smirnoff drinks. I ordered 3 Smirnoff drinks and was charged $11 for each. When I questioned the charge, I was told by the manager that happy hour didn't start until 9pm; however, nowhere on the menu was 9pm stated for Thursdays night happy hour. The manager gave us free shots for my birthday, but I still feel the description on the menu should be honored. Loved the place and the atmosphere, but menu descriptions could use some work",

We didn't realize there is a Nutella cream cheese, which threw us off. We thought it said Nutella AND cream cheese. Where can we buy this stuff in bulk????? Also, on Sundays they have $15 mimosas with penny refills!!! Which the bartender adjusted to our taste as far as ratio of OJ. Be cautious, we had one mixed drink other than mimosas and it was PACKED with ice, next time we will ask for light ice. Also, I expected more bacon in the cheddar bacon omelette.

What seems like 15 minutes later you're supposed to sit there watching everyone else eat while waiting for your food.  Then right after you finish eating it seems they want to kick you out of your table.  Service needs some schooling in professionalism.  You don't bring out food until everything for the table is ready... and the kitchen needs to learn timing better to make sure it's all done at the same time.  Waitstaff seemed nice, likely a problem in the kitchen.  I don't expect management to respond here as I've read other reviews with no comments... smh.",

    "text": "Whiskey Row is a great night-time spot, if you're going out in Old Town and you don't mind paying $12-$14 for a small glass of moonshine. The tables have taps that are kind of unique - you can pour your own beers, and at the end of the night, they charge you for the volume of beer that's been poured.  Honestly, if I were rating this place on the night-time vibes alone, I'd probably give it three stars. The service is pretty awful, but the place is cool and the honky tonk vibe is unique, relative to the rest of Old Town. (Being from Tennessee myself, I appreciate having what feels like a little vegas'ed-up slice of Nashville out here in AZ.)  Now, the DAY time rating for this place ought to be a single star. The food is mediocre, the service is terrible and no one seems to really care that it's bad. I've been here for brunch twice. The badass bloody mary comes with an awesome slider (probably the best thing I've had there), but the drink itself was WAY too sweet. I have no idea what they're putting in it, but it was almost too much sweetness to drink. The omelette was unseasoned and cool, like it had been sitting. (The rest of our table was pretty disappointed with their food too. about 6 of us had bloody marys and only one person really enjoyed theirs.) The service is slow, inexperienced, and if I had to guess, the girls who spend the night dancing on the bar (no judgement here - it's just that they might be a little better at the bar-dancing than serving. I've been a server - I get that it can be tough... but the place wasn't slammed either time that I was there and the service was still awful).   On our second trip, we ordered some fried pickles as an app. The server that brought them out dropped half of them on the floor and 15 minutes later, brought us TWO individual spears of fried pickles to make up for it (less than what had been dropped). You only get like 8 in an order, and honestly, if you drop half of it, you ought to just bring another order or at LEAST what you dropped! We repeatedly had to flag people down for refills and ultimately, checks. For the price of brunch here, you'd be much better served to go over to RnR, Breakfast Club or Daily Dose. RnR is constantly packed, but at least their servers pay attention to their tables, and you get a decent amount of food. This will be an occasional evenings only place for me in the future.",

After telling them that her purse and phone were inside the bouncer would not let her get her things, nor did they have any employee bring her her things. They did not have to let her back in but it is their responsibility to make sure their customers are safe (according to the Arizona liquor board). There's no one that answers the phone there, so I can't contact a manager. I am disgusted that they would not allow someone to get her belongings and did not care about her safety at all. What kind of establishment makes a girl walk off alone with no phone or purse at 1 am? Still waiting to hear from a manager. I will never go here again.",

    "text": "Here on a Thursday night watching the Broncos vs Cards game ( I was forced into coming here by my boyfriend, as I am not a football fan at all.)   With that being said it's been a pleasant experience. The bar is clean. The staff is friendly and attentive. Drinks are constantly being poured, I only orders water but it has been constantly full.   The ambiance is great if your a fan of the Broncos as this is like their bar supposedly... or just out on the town for a casual night out with friends.  (Keep in mind this is a country bar and the music mirrors that.)   FOOD: was typical bar food, but overpriced for what you get (IMO). The chicken strips were super basic and had no flavor.   They had ran out of burgers for some reason...pulled pork sandwich wasn't the best. Fries tasted like they were fried with fish or something, had an odd aftertaste.   The food took FOREVER to get to our table. A good 40 minuets.",

The server who was training was patient with our whole group asking for drinks and was knowledgeable in what the spirits came in them. The food was spaced out when delivered, we wished that it all came out at once. I saw our server walking to the kitchen mulitple times to check on our food and she was apologetic about the foods delay. The main server was always smiling and letting us joke with her  even after  we asked her a million questions and kept changing our drink order. She was fantastic and will be back for her service",

Our trip organizer reached out to Whiskey Row and they were happy to accomodate us on Sunday night.  They offered drink specials and also were leniant with their dress code so that everyone could wear Chargers jerseys.  It was packed!  However, the service was still fast and friendly, the drinks were strong and everyone left happy.  They played some Chargers videos for us, along with the \"San DIego Super Chargers\" song!  Note: There is currently a Yelp check-in offer for a free appetizer.  I had the Southern Fries, which were amazing.  They were fresh cut fries with white BBQ pulled chicken, melted cheddar, bleu cheese and whiskey BBQ sauce.  They are normall $9 and I would definitely order them again - it was a large portion and filling enough for an entree.  They also have a great beer selection and the music was on point (especially if you are a country music fan).  It didn't seem as pretentious as some of the other nearby bars/clubs.  When I am in the area again, I will make a special visit to Whiskey Row.  Thank you for your awesome hospitality!",

I came on a Sunday night and it was easy to get in. The security at the front were friendly and nice.   My friends chose this place to chill at before heading to Maya, and it wasn't bad. We drank and danced. The crowd there was very respectful and a couple of guys taught us how to country dance, the basic two step - really fun and cute! Better than bumpin' and grindin' at the clubs.   It's interesting just to sit at a table and watch people dance. Really creative moves! Lots of throwing and twirling and flipping, goodness gracious!   It's a pretty friendly and chill environment and atmosphere. Not desperate or hungry like the club or usual bar vibe.   There's lots of free seating outside on the patio, as well as inside around the bar.   The bathrooms were dirty though and unkept, which is usually rare for a place in old town. I found this very odd. There also wasn't an attendant in the ladies room, but apparently there's one in the men's room. Also, odd for old town.   Our drinks were mixed well and I loved their whiskey variety and cocktails, some interesting concoctions! They were priced the same as anywhere else in old town.  The DJ was alright, but since I'm not a connoisseur in country music, there's not much I can say there. :P",

Holy smokes, these are good. Not the traditional small party wings like most places, but the big ones. You know, like the size of real chickens. Anyway, their twist on buffalo sauce was amazing. Not to spicy at all and full of flavor, almost a hint of a tomato base. Absolutely delicious.    The beer on tap is awesome,  you serve yourself. Genius! They charge by the oz. And you never wait for a refill or have to wait for a waitress.  I've never seen this before and think its extremely brilliant.

I ended up making the trek from Sun City to Scottsdale and let me tell you it was worth it. As soon as we walking in I smelled a wonderful aroma of vanilla and bourbon and the wonderful waitress informed me that it's their signature scent and they infuse it in the air. It was awesome!!  As we sat down we were greeted by a very nice server who gave us the run down of the place. I looked at the liquor menu and man was it extensive. It had a really great selection of whiskey's and bourbons which is to be expected. But they also had a really great selection of beer there.   My grandma ended up getting the Dierks' lemonade which had whiskey and strawberry lemonade in it. I tried some of it and it was the perfect thing to be drinking in the dry Arizona air. Now when I went I was sick and I wanted some whiskey. But I also wanted a beer. Luckily, the waitress had the perfect solution. BEER COCKTAIL! Usually when you get a beer cocktail the liquor over powers the beer and all the beer does is provide a fizz. Not this cocktail! It had blackberry whiskey, fresh blackberries, pbr and their house sour. Everything complimented each other so well. It made a fantastic cocktail.   By the time I got my food I was a little buzzed but I was really impressed with the food. It was all down south comfort food presented with a gourmet twist. The presentation was gorgeous and the taste was amazing!! I got a chicken salad wrap with tomato bisque. I think it was the best meal I had in Arizona. What was cool was that everything on their menu is really simple but they do it so well it tastes amazing!!  This is a pretty cool place. When I was asked to described this place I said it was a country gastropub. Which is pretty accurate. I kind of wish I could have visited this place on the weekend. It sounded pretty cool!1",

I've ordered the steak, pretzel w/ cheese, a few of the burgers, and the house salad.... all great choices while watching a football game. And everything has been cooked to exceed my standards. If you're going out to watch the game, listen to a mix of music, or dance - Whiskey Row is great!",

So, I invited a bunch of colleagues to meet after work for happy hour.  I reserved one of these tables online via their website.  We arrived and lo and behold....there are BEER TAPS ON THE TABLE!!! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dierks-bentleys-whiskey-row-scottsdale?select=kiB0dPVKVgs_o1eS0_1xmg#kiB0dPVKVgs_o1eS0_1xmg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dier...</a>  Our server informed us that to activate the tap, we have to put a credit card down and then we can freely pour ourselves or she can pour for us.  There's an iPad on the table that's connected to the tap system that shows the consumption of each type of alcohol on the tap.  You pay by the ounce.  We were super excited and we all grabbed pints and started pouring from the tap.  We were like little kids opening a Christmas present....we had giddy smiles and big eyes...it's not hard to get a group of men excited about Beer.  We watched the meter on the iPad grow as we poured more and more Beer.  There's also a tap that has a Fireball-like Whiskey for shots....later in the evening shots happened.  In between all of the drinking, we tried the Chicken Sliders, which were very good and Fried Pickles, which looked like the Fried Silkworms in China I ate a few years ago. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dierks-bentleys-whiskey-row-scottsdale?select=3qkz8IWe_fjfTsuxy2WO1w#3qkz8IWe_fjfTsuxy2WO1w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dier...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dierks-bentleys-whiskey-row-scottsdale?select=RaSVVf-aofwsYa4wegy2Ag#RaSVVf-aofwsYa4wegy2Ag\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dier...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dierks-bentleys-whiskey-row-scottsdale?select=CXACN95KwUK8G7GoWpWQ-A#CXACN95KwUK8G7GoWpWQ-A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dier...</a>  The service was so/so throughout the evening.  Our server went from attentive to a disappearing act...they're really young and inexperienced here, so it's to be expected.  The vibe and atmosphere is very Old Town Scottsdale....it's a party place.  As the night goes on, the more of a party it becomes.  We left around 8 pm and people were starting to show up for the later activities.  Overall, it's a pretty fun place.  Return Factor - 90%",

And an annoying mix of greasy douches, clubgirls and obvious tourists trying to be country-trendy.  I can't say it was much different the second time around except that this time I was buzzed by the time I got there and I had my crew with me. So we could have been at a leper colony and still would have had a blast.   Georgia Chrome was cranking out live tunes and they had very nice girls feeding us whiskey from the bar. So several beers and some moonshine later we wound up having a damn good time. It turns out I'm a decent two-stepper....who knew?  While this still isn't my first idea of a good time I would come again, but here's some advice:  -Have a few drinks elsewhere first. I don't recommend coming here until you're a little   buzzed.  -Have a sense of humor and be prepared for crowds  -Ladies: There are a plethora of sleazy guys here who WILL hit on you. -Guys: There are a plethora of sleazy dudes who will not hesitate to hit on your girl  -As Blake Shelton would put it, the more you drink, the more fun you will have. The    moonshine is your express ticket to drunken funness but although it's not the real    stuff, you will hurt the next day.  Good times, worth checking out if you take the above precautions.",

    "text": "At the end of the day I think I would have liked this place better if I would have stopped in for HH...or brunch...or a weeknight...or w/just a few friends. Basically, I just think coming here w/14 other girls on a Saturday night for a bachelorette party, although super fun, is also kind of a chore.   I really do like the place itself. It's a really big area, and I like that the bar wraps around like a square and that there's plenty of bartenders. If dancing's your thing the dance floor seems pretty big as well.  Like I said, we came for a bachelorette party, and although I didn't personally take care of any of the details, there were a couple small snafus. First, when we called to book a table (this I was actually present for) we were told that we didn't \"have\" to get bottle service, but would probably have to pay some sort of minimum on drinks. They would contact my friend who personally spoke to someone \"soon\" to go over the details. It took somebody a couple weeks to get back to her, but when they did they did inform her we would in fact have to get the \"minimum\" bottle service. Honestly, it really wasn't that big a deal. Like I said, there was 14 of us, and the minimum bottle service was $200 (we got Grey Goose), plus they would throw in a round of shots.   We got the table for 10 o'clock. However, when we showed up we were told we didn't have it until 10:45. Again, I didn't personally take care of this detail, but they did scramble to get us a table ASAP (it took about 20 min).   Overall, we had no major issues, and I thought this place was fun. When we left the line to get in was around the corner, and if I were to just randomly come here on a Saturday night I don't think waiting in a long line to get in would be worth it.   I'd like to come back sometime to try the taps at the tables.",

    "text": "Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row is the latest and newest place to open in Old Town Scottsdale. It's basically a sports bar / nightclub with a country music theme.   Like most entertainment establishments in Scottsdale the servers are exclusively very attractive females and at Whiskey Row they are attired in outfits that you would normally see at Country Thunder - tight t-shirts, cutoff jeans shorts, and cowboy boots. Guys will enjoy the view.  While the theme is good old country music, the food and beverages are anything but old fashioned. The menu includes burgers, salads, shrimp, flat iron steak, grilled cheese, and chicken breasts.   As for the drinks, Whiskey Row has installed the latest system where each table, and even the foosball table, has a set of taps serving alcohol and beer so you can refill your drinks at your convenience. Just order what you want from the computer screen at each table, use your credit card to pay for it and drink away. I doubt it unlimited though, other places that use this system limit you to a specific number of refills before the servers have to reauthorize you to get more, so you can't just sit there and get hammered.  Also, because the drinks are served in this manner they are charged by the ounce rather than by the glass.   And, if you really want to do shots of whiskey the fun way, there is a dentist-type chair by the entrance that tilts back and allows you to have whiskey poured straight down your gullet. I have a feeling that's going to be quite popular with the Scottsdale clientele.  Whiskey Row features a combination of live music and a DJ, but it will all be country. The band will perform on a stage that is suspended above the bar and there is a small dance floor next to the bar as well.   They are also showing the UFC fights and at least for the most recent one, they did not charge a cover which is a good deal if you like that sport.  I predict that this is going to be a very popular new addition to the Scottsdale nightlife lineup",

A handful of tables were occupied but there was a lot of empty seats as well.  I went with a cucumber cocktail since it sounded refreshing and not overly sweet. It was in fact pretty sweet but still decent (and not cheap either, coming in around $14 or so).  Yes they play country music which usually makes me cringe and complain but somehow it didn't seem to phase my pooped brain or body. The best part of the experience honestly was the cute doggies. One pup at a neighboring table kept scooting along the bench to visit for pets. Yay!  Service was decent, no complaints there. Overall an a-okay spot to stop for a drink or two on a sunny afternoon.",

The sweet potato fries were also delicious but came with ketchup instead of the special mayo sauce. Peach ale was $4 - very light and refreshing. Ladies who don't like beer, if the guys drag you here then get the peach ale for yourself. I hate beer and thoroughly enjoyed this drink.   I hear the Tempe location has all craft beers on tap for happy hour. This place only has coors light and Budweiser. Also note, this place gets really loud at night and sort of turns into a mini club. I'd come back just for happy hour though for some light bites.",

First reason that made me change my mind and give this place another chance came down to my interactions with Kevin.   Last year, after the incident,  Kevin personally reached out to me on behalf of the restaurant to apologize and asked me if there was a way they could make up for what had happened. At the time, I did not think that I would come back again.   Last week, my friends and I decided to visit Scottsdale again for spring training so I reached out to Kevin to see if the offer still stood - although I haven't spoke with Kevin for over 10 months, he remembered me and told me that he would take care of my party.  After being admitted by the bouncers and having our reservation confirmed, Rudy the GM personally greeted us and showed us to one of the best tables in the house.   After we sat down, Rudy came over and offered to take care of the appetizers. We ordered wings, fries and fried pickles, and they were actually really good. We also ordered a few rounds of drinks and each time we got our drinks promptly after our order.   After the outstanding customer service last night, I really felt that the management went out of their way to make our visit memorable and enjoyable.   I'm really glad I gave this place a second chance and will be excited to recommend this place to all of our friends and colleagues in Phoenix!",

Couple of weeks ago I went into Whiskey row on a packed Friday night. Upon arriving the bouncers were very wecloming and checked id's at a very quick pace. Heading in doors the music volume was  set to the perfect pitch and the song choices are on point. The combinaton of  music and great lighting set up an awesome ambiance. Where I was most impressed was with the bartending service. On the occasion I had the opportunity to get drinks from Jordan, Lane and Mimi. Each one was perfectly crafted with a great ratio of alcohol to mixer as well I found them very reasonably priced.  As i sat at the bar the ladies checked back with me on how my drink quality was.  I personally was impressed by this as found this for as more drink orders came in they still knew to come back and check in on the customer.  I ended up staying there most of the night as a local band was playing and the energy inside the bar was extremely upbeat. With good music, excellent service and drinks I highly recommend whiskey row to anyone looking for a fantastic bar in old town scottsdale!",

    "text": "When the wife and I can find a sitter on a Friday night, this is where I like to go.  The main reason I come here is because we like to dance and this is about as \"modern country\" as Phoenix has to offer.  Generally we'll drop in about 9pm and have some food and socialize, then at 10pm the live music and dancing starts in earnest.  The last time we went the band was Georgia Chrome and they play a good mix of country tunes and couple rock tunes (Journey, AC/DC) as well.  It's nice.  If you value your hearing, you'll wear some ear plugs, though.  This place gets very crowded after 11:30pm - as in \"I can't get to the bar\" crowded.  But once I do get to the bar, I haven't had much difficulty ordering drinks so long as you use good bar etiquette and stay clear of the bar dancers.  My only complaint is that the dance floor could be larger.  But we'll sometimes find a less crowded spot away from the dance floor and get our groove on.  When we leave at around 1am, there is always a full house and a line out front.",

Another bartender who looks just like the bartender that took my friend's order comes to me and asks me what I want. Thinking she was the same bartender who took my friend's order and is clarifying what my friend ordered for me I tell her my drink. She brings back my drink and at the same time the first bartender brings the two drinks that my friend ordered. I explain to her that my friend only ordered two drinks and I thought I was only clarifying to the other bartender what my friend ordered for me and she can take the extra drink back. She rolls her eyes at me in a very rude way and says no your friend ordered two drinks and you ordered one so you have to pay for three drinks and I can't take any drinks back! my friend ended up paying for the two drinks and I paid for the extra third drink that I never ordered which I ended up giving to someone else . It goes without saying that I didn't leave her any tips and left the place pretty unhappy about what she did.

Don't get me wrong, it is a great bar/nightclub but the food is totally underrated. They make their own fried pickles from scratch and have mini corn dogs made with CHORIZO sausage! Never tried anything like that before but loved it. For the meal I tried the Shrimp & Grits, and for the size of the shrimp it was surprisingly affordable and the grits had chunks of ham in it (I didn't even know what grits were before but loved it lol. Kinda like mashed potatoes). My friend tried the Whiskey Burger and said it was delicious. Grilled jalapenos and bacon under melted cheddar with BBQ sauce. They also have a great drink menu. I tried their New Fashioned, which was served in a mason jar over crushed ice and had fresh blackberries muddled into it. The bartender told me how they use a blackberry whiskey in it and a type of bitters that really makes the drink. The staff is polite and personable, and the girls aren't bad to look at either ;). The layout is cool; big bar, nice open patio, wood panel walls that give it that country feel and the stage where live music performs is ABOVE the bar. As far as an overall restaurant/bar/club in Old Town, this has to be my number 1 spot! This place has everything and you could catch me here any day of the week.",

Come and finding out we cant bring our children in on a Sunday afternoon to have lunch. there's NO PLACE on the website nor when I called they said anything about no kids r welcome. At Toby Keith bar and grill they let family with kids in until 10pm. My 10 tear old son wanted to go there to see it and have fun and eat. He is a big fan of yours and top it off he is handicap, h a victim of shaken baby. He only has half of his brain working and he's 95% blind in his right eye. also a good friend of mine Ryan played there and plus Chad Freeman. I think its a unfair and untreated place if u put a menu out for a full line of food to people. The people that worked there didn't care at all. They where more about people over the age 21 that was drinking. To me as a Farm raised Rancher and other people will agree with me on this one. Sundays is family day no matter where you live or from. If Mr. Bentley thinks other then that then he shouldn't be in the Bar business. My kids was upset about not able to go in to enjoy brunch/dinner and do little line dancing, listing to good old country music. I have meet a DJ and a promo person that works there. Mr. Diesel wasn't to happy about how the staff handle the problem. I would like somebody to contact me soon about this or ill be filing with the BBB.",

All the times that I have gone they have good music, if not a live band playing, and the Manager that has helped us several times, Courtney, always makes sure that the food and service is up to par... hopefully it stays fun and doesn't die out like a lot of places do in old town....One thing to keep in mind if you get a table inside, is that the beer/whiskey dispenser at the table charges per ounce and can add up pretty quickly!!",

    "text": "Of all places for a country bar to open, Scottsdale is an interesting choice. I like this place particularly because of that very reason. If you've ever been to other country bars in Mesa, Glendale, Cave Creek. Most of the Scottsdale douche bags have given up on the bar and found their way next door to HiFi but I'm terrified they may return now that they're mixing country music with hiphop/EDM. Alcohol prices are very reasonable given the location, still waiting for a reason to try the food. I spoke briefly with a (Manager?) Courtney. I'm pretty sure she is one of the reasons (the mortar to the brick so to speak) this bar does so well after watching her work, as she's pretty on point about keeping it clean, stocking the bar and making sure everyone gets taken care of. Suggestions; next time you build a bar, don't design it so people stand around on the dance floor right in front of the bar. Keep playing the unmixed country music and bringing in Class A/B artists! Also couldn't hurt to try out the local talent!",

I was swindled into purchasing a bottle and bottle service which I was told would be \"comped\" and I was only liable for tipping the waitress and they only needed my card to hold the table but would not be charged. I was told this by the manager named Robert as well as a promoter named Bobby D. When my card was charged at the end of the night I was promised that it would be refunded into my account by the next day and I would only be charged for the gratuity for the waitress. I am afraid to contact the bar over phone as I do not wish to speak with the same people that promised me a refund. Thank you for reading and I'm looking forward to hearing back fro m someone.",

    "text": "Seriously, why in the heck am I updating this review when I vowed to never come back here after blacklisting this place. Well, as you have it I went to Scottsdale last weekend and the group outvoted me so I played along (not without a drunken rant about how anywhere in Scottsdale is better than Whiskey Row).  In general, my opinion still stands of Whiskey Row. There was still three lines but this time we did get in. And as you have it we did try to grease our way in but were denied (just so you know, the going rate is +$20 per person). Just for the record I wanted no part in greasing my way into an establishment that I didn't want to go into anyways but my group tried anyways - you know how much more alcohol you can buy for $20 at some of the \"less popular\" places in Scottsdale? Yeah, I know that I sound like an alcoholic so leave me alone.  In any case we did get in. The place is a swamp both figuratively and literally. When I was finally admitted in I headed straight for the restroom. First off, line for the dudes. Not many places can claim this but WR does it quite well. Always a line, and this is of course completely True for the ladies too. My girlfriend reported that the women's bathroom was flooded. Gross. Nothing like a bunch of catty broads swimming their way through the bathroom - hope you wore a miniskirt and not your $200 boot cut  jeans! In short I can't believe that Whiskey Row has such a small bathroom. No thanks.  The dance floor is an absolute joke. JOKE. It is nothing more than a clusterfuck and I am pretty sure I have more room in my family room than this dance floor. Add in everyone hammmered drunk and this is a bonafide disaster. No thanks.  Once out of the bathroom we tried to get a drink at the bar. Nope. Slow service. And not only that... no Coors or Budweiser. What the hell? Where the hell am I? how the hell do you not have those two domestics... not even in bottle? WTF? What the hell is everyone drinking in here - catfish water? No thanks.  In short, there is still nothing appealing to me about this place - you have long waits to get in, the dance floor is one of the worst (even for bullshit dancing, much less country dancing), the bar is slow, the bar is dry, the bathrooms are dirty, and the drink prices aren't all that appealing. The only thing this place has going for it is that it plays country - and I love country.  Final result - this place is on my perma-perma ban list. If my party wants to go here they can but I'll go somewhere else by myself before going back in here.",

My friend and I both took pictures of our food ... that's how good it looked ... and it tasted even better.  Try the Breakfast Sandwich. YUM!  Their servers are incredibly nice.  Plus they have an amazing mimosa deal for brunch.  $12 for bottomless.  So good.  As a side note, we were impressed how clean the place was.  We imagine they had to clean up a fair amount from the crazy night before.  I feel like it's only a matter of time before this place starts getting packed on the weekends.  For now, it's a nice change of pace from RnR's weekend brunch party.",

And if that isn't a sleazy enough scene for you, then your thirst for the sleaze will surely be quenched when the unitard/booty short wearing bar maids climb up on the bar (Coyote Ugly circa 1997...) and shake it for the folks waiting 30 minutes to get their over priced drinks.  Maybe I am just getting old, but when the girls climbed up on the bar...it just made me feel bad for them and the person that thinks this is still innovative/cool for business.  The DJ plays very little country music.  The drinks are really pricey.  Paid $18 for two 12 ounce beers...  It is a cool set up...but the over arching theme/act in this place, just made me want to go home and shower.",

That meatball slider. ....I could eat 100 it was so good. They use veal and fresh seasonings and herbs. Homemade tomato sauce was a great touch. I loved the cheese sauce on the mac n cheese, it had a bit of a spiciness to it.   My grandpa goes out to eat every day, if you ask him how his food is he always says \"okay\". He got the whiskey burger and he said \"oh my god this burger is awesome. This is the best bun I have ever had on a burger\" and he is still talking about it.

On rodeo weekend they played non stop hip hop.yeah RODEO WEEKEND. Ive been to probably 30 different country bars in my time and this is the only one that doesn't play country music. So now I just want a drink since I can't enjoy the music. I walk right up to the bar and wait about 10 mins before the angry blonde bartender asks me what I want. I order a jack and coke and other drinks for my girl and her friends. I take a sip and it's not jack. It's Evan Williams. I have been a bartender for 20 years and I have drank jack my whole life. I know what jack tastes like and what Evan Williams tastes like. So I go up to the same girl and ask if they have jack Daniel's and she says no we're out. So instead of telling me they are out of jack and asking if I wanted something else she just decided for me and charged me. Well I would never have ordered Evan Williams, that's for sure. So now I have a drink I can't drink and music that is just terrible. After the girls finish their drinks we leave to go to the next bar and realize 2 of the 4 girls can't find their wallets. So we go back and tell the security we have 2 lost wallets and they don't really care. Not a single person helped in any way. 2 girls both losing their wallets in the same place within 45 mins. They were stolen. We looked everywhere in that bar and they are gone. So now we have to go home cause 2 people don't have id now. I will NEVER step foot in that bar again and I will make sure everybody I know knows how terrible this place is.",

Arrived at 11ish and the line was not bad at all (though it was on a holiday weekend, so I'm not sure how it is normally), got in with no cover though there was a live band playing and were immediately served a couple beers at $4 a pop. Music was great - ESPECIALLY when Dierks Bentley himself showed up and did a couple numbers!! The dance floor was great, drinks were delicious and overall, we had a really good time. Would definitely recommend!",

I know we are in AZ, Scottsdale, but I thought it was a country bar and it ain't!  Its a typical Scottsdale crowd bar. I knew, that because it was Scottsdale, people would be in shorts and t-shirts.   I was still hoping it was a little country so I put on my big boy pants (wranglers) a polo shirt and my Dan Post lace ups to try and be very casual. We were overdressed. Most people barely had clothing on.  Most had tanks, shorts, & flip flops.  UGH, flip flops in a bar?  Shoes people, please. The bar was packed and most the bar staff did not look like they were in the mood to deal will all the drunk idiots.  There were a lot of them.  It is not a Country bar like you might think, with Dierk's name on it.  You must check out the website. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdierkswhiskeyrow.com&s=cc891d73cca9f5498de4cfaa476dd161e4dc72acc6fdbc06d01a6968b157a874\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">dierkswhiskeyrow.com</a>     It is more like a sports bar than a country bar, though they do have live scheduled shows.  The food other people in our party ordered was good.  It all looked great. I did not eat, this visit.  I noticed several people giving 5 star reviews, I have a different standard.  The space is beautiful a typical trendy place for Scottsdale.  For God sake, do not wait in line to get in people. There are 50 bars within a ten block radius.",

It seemed like it was a manager who seated us and he had no clue where to put us, so we said a booth was fine, and he put us in a booth that was seriously meant to seat about 12.  Our waitress got drinks quickly but that was the only thing that happened timely.  I had tomato bisque with grilled cheese (SO GOOD) and my husband had their Mac 'N Cheese burger.  We waited about 10 minutes for drink refills and another 10 minutes for the check and had to flag her down for that.  I think she had one other table...   It's probably a great bar at night, but I would not recommend anyone come here for lunch or anything.  I'm not sure why they're even open during the day...?",

I went on a Friday night and the place was packed! It was so packed that the dance floor was full of people just standing around talking. I wanted to get my \"boot-scoot-boogying on\". Didn't happen!  A great band was playing too! Some of the female staff and the lead singer of the band (female) danced on the bar. That was very entertaining...if that's what gets you going. Although it was crowded with the young and old alike, the bartenders and baristas were on top of it! No long waits to place a drink order.

Alittle hip hick if you like. Contemporary redneck swank, fashionable country chic or Hollywood hillbilly, I don't know.   I mean, I had fun here. But it really is an iconoclast and kitsch ripoff of what is praised as country, because none of the clientele would be caught dead in a real country dive. But then again, I might be one of them. Shit, I categorize anyone that vociferate a yee-haw as a degenerate.   BUT this place is happening and it has some of the standard traits of Scottsdale. One is hot vamps dancing on the bar pouring liquor in peoples mouths for tips. There is a dance floor that mostly contains club-hoppers that too drunk to know what bar they are in. But the overall vibe here is still nicer that most of the Scottsdale arena IMO.  I'd come back here.",

Having not done bottle service before, Chelsea was patient and explained everything to me. Thanks to a cancelation, we were able to get a larger booth.  We had 10 in our group and we were very comfortable in our booth.    The crowd is very young and the place was packed (cheek to cheek) on a Saturday night.  We arrived at 10 and I was very happy that we had done the bottle service. The dance floor is very small not very well laid our for a country bar. All of the ladies in our group ended up dancing on the table.  They had a great time.  The bathrooms are undersized (4-holes in the men's room) for a club of this size.  Drinks were reasonably priced.  Our waitress was very busy, as would be expected in a hot Scottsdale club on a Saturday night, but she kept us hydrated.  The only complaint that I have is that they have these cool table taps.  Well the taps have been shut down because of some many problems with the metering device.  Our hostess Chelsea offered to turn them ON, but warned that we would be responsible and that there have been problems.  Kudos for shutting them down and not continuing to screw-people over, but get the damn thing fixed.  This is a very Scottsdale trendy spot (juiced up bouncers, hot little waitresses, too much Affliction-wear and young ladies in platform heels), with a mix of country music.  The DJ did a good job of keeping the dance floor (all 20' x 20' of it) packed all night.  I would recommend Whiskey Row as a great place to party if you like modern country music.  If you are looking for Jennings and Cash / Ropers and Wranglers, Jack Daniels and PBR this isn't your place.",

Everything on the menu looked great and I can't wait to go back to try more of what they have to offer. It's my understanding that their Executive Chef came from the Phoenician and as you can tell when you order from the menu she brought her quality of food with her.   My experience at night was a positive one as well. It was extremely crowded and I had to wait in line for about 15 minutes but it was definitely worth it. Once I got inside Courtney was my bartender. She was not only quick to serve me but did it with a smile. She helped to recommend drinks and made sure that my glass was never empty. As someone who has a customer service background I noticed that not only was she making me feel like a valued customer but she was able to serve many others with the same geniune attention and service with a smile.   The only thing I would change about my experience wasn't the staff who served me or the food & beverages I ordered but the overall layout. I wish the dance floor was bigger and the bar itself had a little more room.   It's a great bar and a fun place to hang out. I will be sure to visit again!",

The fries are absolutely delectable and 1 is plenty to share between 3 or 4 people.  I had the grilled cheese for my meal and substitued sweet potato chips for the tomato soup.  I added the candied bacon to my sandwich and I'm glad I did because it was some of the best bacon I have ever had. I can't wait to go back and have the grilled cheese again the twang of the goat cheese paired with the sweetness of the onion jam is amazing.  For dessert there we had Strawberry Shortcake. It was very good, and not too sweet.  The service was great! The only issue I had was if you're short and they seat you at one of the tables or the bar it's kind of uncomfortable because there isn't a bar high enough on the chair for your feet but other than that, my experience was very good!",

The bright yellow lights on the wall spelling \"TIP IT ON BACK\" were rather glaringly annoying.  The bartenders were not very pleasant, charming or energized.  I had one beer with my friend as we watched two 'interesting' bachelorette parties, some drunk golfers, and some other random gals wearing tutus...like I said not exactly country.  After that we decided it was time to move on to the next watering hole...not sure this spot is for me.",

    "text": "Went here Friday evening after work for happy hour around 630-7ish.  We ended up liking the atmosphere and posted up until like 11PM!  The music they played was actually pretty good, not ALL country music.  The crowd was interesting, 25-30 somethings with a few 50's sprinkled in the mix.  There was the normal Scottsdale crowd...you know, bedazzled jeans/belt buckles, shmedium sized shirts.  Then there were your random camo wearing cowboy hats.  And just your average people.  So it was a nice mix and definitely some great people watching.    We had the Chips and Dip for $7.  It was.....bleh.  The chips were soggy and lip so in order to get the dip onto the chip you had to use a fork and fold it over. Eh.....  On a good note our bar tender was awesome !  She was super attentive (even once it got packed) and funny!  She made killer drinks and chatted it up with us ladies, and if you're a lady...you know that can be quite rare.    Another interesting thing is their band is above the bar.  So, if you're sitting at the bar you just see flailing arms, the end of a guitar and the occasional hair flip.  The band on Friday was not too great so we preferred the DJ over the live brand which is surprising.  The later it got into the evening the longer the line got leading up to the door.  When I go back again I will be doing it the same way I did (happy hour into the night), I don't foresee myself waiting in line to get in.   I am looking forward to going back and sitting at a booth with a little mini tap and ordering some beer and kicking back.  Maybe having food with a little more substance in hopes that it's yummier than the Chips and Dip.  I will definitely be back to this bar!",

Arrived around 930 and I was glad there wasn't a cover (at the time). Not sure if they charge a cover afterwards.  Area is very nice, very clean and tv screens everywhere. Staff was very friendly and I was able to seat myself and 2 other friends comfortably. Ordered the grilled cheese with fries as a side (you can substitute any side for the soup). I was very impressed with the sandwich - it had 3 types of cheese combined with jam and it tasted awesome. Fries were better than the standard bar food. I also tried my friend's tomtato/pesto mozzarella sandwich - I recommend that as well.  The band plays on top of the bar on a stage and they sound really good. Didn't recognize any of their songs but they did play some cover some mainstream songs like \"Don't Stop Believin'\" so I was able to sing along to that I guess. Had a great time and I'd definitely come back again.",

The place was packed and hard to get around, but that's expected on a Saturday night.  Miller Lite bottles were $4, which isn't bad.  The worst part was the 35 year old guy taking his shirt off and flexing for younger girls.  Classic Scottsdale I guess.  Would like to go during the day so I can check out the menu.

I called because the hotel shuttle was late. The hostess said if we were there by 845 its ok but we have to be done eating by 930 as they turn tables into bottle service. We go there at 839... 9 minutes after and the arrogant rude manager refused to seat us. To busy on his phone outside to manage a restaurant.... he turned away a table of 8 bachlorette party because he didnt want to work. He argued with me and was still on his phone while talking to me. We own restaurants were we live and i would never in my right mind act like he did . Dirks he give you a bad rep not only as a restaurant but as a owner and singer. Its sad we had to experience this type of service. We walked across the street and were helped immediately had great food and fun atmosphere.  Wont recommend or go to this place again.",

Not that the food is any good at Dierks, actually probably just average bar food, but I have no idea as they stop serving food at 9pm on weekends. Wtf? All so they can take hooker looking waitresses around for 'bottle service'. Now just that would have been more tolerable seeing as they do actually play country music, which some country bars do go away from later in the evening. But they took all the chairs and tables away so there is no where to sit unless you overpay for a booth on the outskirts. Definitely won't be back and don't waste your time going as there are so many better places to hang out in Scottsdale. What a disappointment coming from My wife's favorite country artist. He could do so much better",

The wings were deep fried and topped with whiskey hot sauce which was a little spicy and a little sweet. It came with a side of Bleu cheese dressing and carrots. These are crispiest wings I've ever had. They weren't dry; they were pretty moist underneath. Good flavor too.   The mac and cheese was really good. The pasta was mixed in a 3 cheese blend with green chilies and sun dried tomatoes and topped with bacon bread crumbs. The flavor was great and it was so creamy and delicious.  The veal meatball slider was good. A little soft though; it almost tasted like a veggie chicken meatball. It was topped with a tomato marmalade and smoked provolone cheese. Not bad.  The fried chicken slider was good. It was a fried chicken breast topped with an apple jicama slaw. Pretty good.  Our waitress was really cute and really nice.

The portion of the chicken was much smaller and the gravy wasn't the \" to die for\" quality we had before. We also got the whiskey sauced wings which were only partially sauced. I was a little disappointed. Maybe a new chef?? Not sure. I'll still go back because I appreciate the staff and I love the atmosphere at Dierks.",

We were able to listen to several sets before they went on break.   The drinks were good and we shared a few appetizers. The pricing was fair. Nothing outrageously priced.  As the night moved along this placed got packed. The staff was anticipating this and started moving chairs and tables. Mostly for what seemed like they were making room for standing room only.   The staff was primarily good looking woman in short shorts. And some of the bouncers were easy on the eyes. One thing that i noticed that the customer base seemed to be more male orientated on the night that we were here. Hmmm.. this place probably turns into a meat market as the time moves along in the evening.   We left and had to wind our way out of the crowd. One thing that I did notice that was interesting is that it seemed like people could smoke inside the bar? Not sure if this was because there was open air seating. However we could still smell the cigarette smoke. Which was strange since I am used to bars not allowing people to smoke.",

The bartenders or whoever those girls are, dance on the bar top like strippers and you put money in their leg garter. This place is a train wreck. Not even close to being a country bar. Change the name to some generic hip hop name if that's the kind of business your going to run.  Summary: It's not a country bar it's a hip hop nightclub. Two steppers go somewhere else.",

I waited 31 minutes for a bartender to address me as I watched them serve every girl in the bar before me. The menu says the beer I ordered was $5, I was charged $11. So I didn't order more because I was lied to.   I left after staying and being miserable for two hours. When we left the music was so loud I couldn't hear anything like I was under water.   I hope I never get dragged here again.  *Update* I recently visited again and I was excited to get my drink almost immediately as well as the two people with me. They still don't serve their signature cocktails after 10 or 11pm, which sucks, but the service has stepped up. The music is still extremely loud but I would attribute that to the noise pollution they have going on with El Hefe across the street.",

You know, those times in life when you don't have a choice and you are a good friend ...   Walking into this place sober is scary AF. All these men with thirsty eyes desperately scanning the room in search of that one special girl to have a one-night-stand with. I was glad I wasn't drinking. I wanted to wear a sign that said: stone cold sober. That way men with half their drinks spilled down their fronts would know to hit on someone else. My vision is perfect right now, yes, I can see how sweaty and gross you are.   There is one thing in this place worthy of five stars, though. There is a dancer on the bar with the best ass I have ever seen. I'm sorry, but it's amazing. My friends and I just stare at it with a mix of adoration and jealousy. How can we make our asses look like that? Can I tip you for workout advice? Seriously, though, how much would you charge to tell me your butt toning secrets? I do squats, dammit. I went on three hikes last week! If I had that ass ... I'd NEVER wear pants. I'd be Donald Duck-ing it all day every day. Ladies, if you come here with your man, do not even think about getting mad if he stares at this girl's butt all night. You will be doing it too, don't lie. It's the only thing about this place worthy of 5 stars.",

We had a large group packed into a curved back booth with its own draft pull, and when people from our party got up to mingle, the less energetic of us could kick our feet up and watch the big TVs.

I enjoy the mini second level area which is perfect for a band to play. The beer table taps sound like a great idea but honestly it had major drawbacks. The beer took about three refills (16oz x .35) to stop foaming and poor properly. If youre there with a group forget about splitting the tab or figure it out beforehand. The waitress were dressed a little to skanky for a chill happy hour for me. Their red bras hung out the side and shirts were tied up high and shorts wore super low. I get it's Scottsdale but I thought they were trying too hard? Lastly, the parking!! Ahh it's impossible to find a place to park where you won't get towed or have to walk a mile. It's a fun place if you plan on staying all night but I would never go out of my way to come back.",

If you enjoy country music this is the place for you.   They have booths with tap handles where you are able to choose 2-3 beers I believe and a liquor to have for your group. Couldn't figure out prices but it seemed really cool if you were with a large group.   Fun place. I would really like to go there with a large group and take advantage of a booth!",

I am a hip hop/R&B girl at heart and I had never been to a country bar before (I don't even think one exists in SoCal hah) and kind of didn't know what to do with myself at first hah. However, the drinks started flowing and the live band began their set and I ended up having a pretty good time! I know I would probably enjoy it so much more if I listened and liked more country music but I always find myself having a good time here. It would never be my go-to place but I will tag along if somebody wants to go. I hope they can get more live bands playing as the vibe of the place is awesome whenever that occurs. =]",

Well when it came to pay the tab they not only charged him the shots but also put on my card to pay. When I asked the bartender why were they put on my card when he already had paid she pretty much called me a liar and said that he only paid for partial, when he didn't I watched him pay every time and plus I not once said I wanted to order any shots at all through the night . The manager got involved and and my brother in law said yes he bought all the shots and guess what that charged him again for the shots that he paid for and shortly after we were kicked out, so this sucks because my brother in law had always wanted to come here with his wife and they finally do because they are Dierks Bentley fans and we are all scammed. So my suggestion to anyone is to just got to the other bars that are around there. I am sure they will treat you right and not try to rob you of your hard earned money.",

    "text": "I really hate writing this review because I've always loved this place. My friends and I frequent Whiskey Row a couple nights a month for a night on the town...great drinks, great atmosphere, music and dancing. I've even seen Dierks himself perform here live twice! It's been my go-to bar in old town ever since opening night. I've had food here 3-4 times total. The food has been great but the service seems to be hit or miss. This is what disappoints me.  Last night, I met up with a friend that was in town that I hadn't seen in years! She'd never been to Scottsdale before so after suggesting many great local restaurants, we decided on Whiskey Row! I knew she'd love it as I do.   The place was pretty dead, as you would expect on a Tuesday night. We decided to sit at the bar and order drinks and dinner. The drinks were great. We ordered an appetizer immediately after receiving our drinks. It took so long to come that at one point we wondered if it was forgotten. We ordered a simple and standard meal, a combination of sliders, fries and a cup of soup. This took approximately 40 minutes to arrive and is pretty unacceptable, especially because of how empty and not busy it was last night. My friend had clearly ordered her sliders with no cole slaw. Our server/bartender recognized that they came out wrong saying \"sorry, they still put the cole slaw on your sliders\". Really?! He had no intention of making her order right...how she ordered it?! He should have told the kitchen this before he ever brought out our food. We were pretty shocked and definitely should have asked for correct ones .... But honestly were way too hungry to wait another 40 minutes. Now for the food....it was barely warm. Basically cold. Fries....pretty cold. It was very disappointing and seemed as if our food had been waiting back there ready for 15 minutes.   This experience was pretty frustrating to us. Our of all the restaurants in old town, we chose this one. I highly recommended it to my friend who's not from the area. We were pretty let down. I think the only thing I'll come here for would be drinks on a Friday or Saturday night. Menu is great, food could be great...but when the service is sub-par and then your food is cold....you are turning customers away.  Thank you for being aware of this situation and I really hope something can be turned around because your customers deserve much better.   Thanks!  Lauren and Lindsey",

I cant explain or compare them to any other spot so your just gonna have to take my word for it and stop in for a sample of your own.  Plus its Deirks spot, who wouldnt be curious enough to check it out.  If you collect stickers, just ask your waitress and she will hook it up..TWO THUMBS UP HIGH FOR ME!",

I loved that they offered a full menu along with s great selection of breakfast cocktails.  Service was awesome and everyone was really friendly.  The manager, Kevin even stopped by our table to make sure we were doing well.  This was my second time there and it won't be my last.",

I was in shock that they would turn away business in the afternoon!  We were always a fan of the restaurant and wanted to share the experience with our family.  We were turned away without a thought and no apology was given.  We will never be bringing anyone to this restaurant again nor will be dining here.  Absolutely ridiculous.  We  went across the street where we were greeted no problem.",
