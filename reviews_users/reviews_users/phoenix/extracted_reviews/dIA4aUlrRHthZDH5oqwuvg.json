And speaking of choices, I was really stuck. I didn't know which one I really wanted. But there's no reason to let that be a hold up - they'll do a sampler, where you get a 3 ounce glass of each of the six beers that they brew on site. Golden Export, Hefeweizen, Pilsner, Marzen, Schwarzbier and the seasonal which this time is the Winterbock.  I decided to sit in the bar area, where they have a few TV's tuned into the latest sporting event. No sound though.  Nice menu of bar foods and decent entrees, but I stuck with something that would go well with the beer. The plate of housemade chips, which were topped with cheese and their winterbock chili. Excellent stuff, I cleaned the plate!  Overall, good good, good service, good beer. I'm a fan!",

    "text": "I've long held the view that Gordon Biersch is significantly underestimated as a player in the craft beer scene. They were one of the last bastions of Reinheitsgebot until recently. Alas, The market has spoken and you will now find various double IPAs and black IPAs and red IPAs... I can't lie-I was hugely disappointed the last time I went in because they did not have the Czech Pilsner on tap. That is one of the best beers going and it's criminal to not have it be a permanent part of the tap lineup. Regardless, their brewers know what they're doing and I would argue that anything they have on tap is a cut above. The food is a bit pricey but very good. Luckily, I go there for the beer and they've got a great happy hour.",

This time I figured I'd try the fish and chips, since you can't screw up something so simple (or so I thought).  Well, it was the blandest fish ever, plus overcooked until it was hard and chewy.  The fries were wet, soggy, and limp.  Barely edible overall, and certainly not anything like you'd expect from a place that promotes itself as an upscale pub.  Don't bother; any random neighborhood bar is a better gamble than this known mediocrity.",

We were there around lunch time and the restaurant wasn't that busy yet. We started off with their beer sampler for $6. It was a lot of fun to try all of those different beers. The hefeweizen was definitely my favorite.  We then ordered the fish tacos with a side of seasonal vegetables and a chicken sandwich with a side of their garlic fries. The portions were big and we were actually full after sharing the fish tacos and drinking all that beer. The tacos were very good and came in a crunchy taco that was hugged by a soft taco. Inside was the grilled fish, salsa, and a remolade sauce. The garlic fries were very good, as well.   All in all we had a very good experience. Service seemed a little slow, considering my husband ordered another beer and we watched it sitting at the bar for about 10 minutes. Other than that, I'm sure we will be back..",

They took our order and 1 hour later we were told the food was just now getting prepared. Several tables around us had the same experience and we all left to get to the concert on time.  The waitress was not apologetic, did not keep us updated on our food order and did not seem to care.  The manager came out to tables around us, ignored us and was not helpful either.  They were not prepared for a crowd although they are located in Westgate where there are events all the time.  I will never return to the restaurant again.  Very poor customer service!",

My husband and son really like the beef. The garlic fries were awesome. None of us liked the calamari. The batter was greasy and lacked flavor. I definitely would not order it again.

When she took the drink back to the bar we then witness the miserable looking, older bartender try to reuse the same drink! The server seen us watching and he poured it out, while making it obvious he was upset about something. Smh. There are too many other restaurants in competition and so far they are not measuring up.

    "text": "My husband and I decided to go out to dinner, and we'd been talking about heading over to Westgate.  We both were in a burger mood, so our decision was made for us.  We've both enjoyed the burgers here in the past, and I was jonesing for some garlic!! (As a side note, neither one of us are really drinkers, so we don't go for the beer.)  It's been a while since we've dined here, so we figured it was about time to go back.  Being a Monday night, it wasn't too crowded, mostly patrons in the bar area watching the basketball game.  The dining room was practically empty.  We were seated immediately, and given the menus to peruse.  It had been a while since we've dined here, and the menus had changed a bit.  Hubby went with the BBQ bacon cheeseburger and I decided on the Kobe cheeseburger.  We both wanted the garlic fries.  It took a little while for our burgers/fries, but it was worth the wait.  The burgers were cooked perfectly.  I'm not a person who likes a big fancy burger, with lots of things on it.  Just give me the bare minimum, with a bun that complements the burger, not overpowers it.  This was that kind of burger.  I added a little ketchup and mustard, then put a tomato slice on it...perfection!  Onto the garlic fries...they are so scrumptious!  The fries were crispy on the outside, yet fluffy on the inside.  The garlic was distributed all over them, not just thrown on top, so there was lots of it.    For dessert, we decided to share the apple bread pudding with ice cream and a whiskey sauce.  OMG!!  It is served warm, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top slowly melting.  We drizzled the sauce over the dessert and dug in.  Let's put it this way, there wasn't anything left on the plate when we were done.    The food was so good!!  My only \"slight\" complaint is that it's a bit dark in the restaurant.  The booth we were sitting in had no overhead lighting.  So, when I first opened the menu, I could barely read it.  My husband really had a problem, because there was a light behind him, so he had a shadow over his menu.  Obviously, we managed, but it would've been nice to have a little overhead lighting, so we didn't have to strain to read.",

We were greeted when we stepped in and were seated immediately. Our waitress was friendly and offered me samples that she never brought over. After taking our order she forgot to mention that my options on sides and would have probably brought me over anything. When the food was brought over we were missing items and the wait for the food was about an hour and half after us being seated. I understand this isn't fast food however giving us notice on time or offering us some suggestions for appetizers or drinks? She even took longer to drop off the bill. Not the best experience I must say.",

But we thought we'd try out the food it sounded good. Went there had a server. who brought us a few samples ; Wasn't a big fan of the beers so didn't order any. After that service kind of dwindled. Especially from her compared to the table next to us that was getting drinks. Took an extremely long time to get food for the amount of people over there. Pretty much walk in and sit down. Food actually tasted good. But I ended up in the hospital with food poisoning ; my wife and I both got sick within four hours of eating there. Her less then I ;  Don't recommend the calamari .",

It started off great, friendly greeting at door, sat ourselves in the bar area and were greeted by our server immediately.  We ordered the cheese curds (which were good, themselves) but the creamy bacon dip that they came with was too much.  The grease had separated from the sauce and it just sat on top, we all avoided it and just used ketchup. For our entrees, I ordered the Cajun Pasta and the other 2 in our party both ordered the California Burgers. They enjoyed the burgers, no complaints other than salty fries, but that can be expected.  The Cajun Pasta on the other hand was extremely salty, inedible.  I couldn't stand more than 2 small bites, I had the others try it to be sure it wasn't just me.  I've ordered this dish before at another Gordon Biersch restaurant and this was completely off. I got the attention of the server and she offered to order me something else, so I too, ordered the California Burger.  The service went downhill at this point, I'm not sure if she didn't know how to deal with the situation but I was very understanding, just ordered another beer and waited for my burger to arrive.  I understand that the food can be off at times, but the servers demeanor changing was off-putting.",

    "text": "I have eaten here a few times over the years and it manages to be edible and mediocre.  We were eating there with a large party before a Coyotes game. We were out on the patio. Our server was extremely nice and very hard-working, and obviously quite overwhelmed by the number of tables she was tasked with. (Meanwhile, the other patio server kept chatting and stalling.) This meant it took a very long time to order, get food, and twenty minutes just to get our check.   My husband loved the beers--though he kept having to go straight to the bar to get drinks for him and friends. The happy hour prices are great. He ordered the Marzen BBQ burger and wasn't too happy with it, as it came out well done, not as he requested.   My son is autistic and a very picky eater. I thought he wouldn't be able to eat anything there, but a friend pointed out they do serve kettle chips even though they aren't on the menu. My son loved those chips! Very fresh and crunchy.  I had the Gorgonzola Pear salad. It was very mediocre, especially in light of the $13 price. The toppings and chicken were good, but it was served on iceberg lettuce with a lot of leaf-ribs. Come on. That's the blandest, cheapest lettuce possible. It's like adding decent toppings to water. I could buy a much, much better salad than this at 1/3 of the price at places like Panera or Wildflower. I am glad they provided me the dressing on the side, as I requested.  I ordered the strawberry soda cocktail to drink as well and I liked it. It had an initial noticeable chemical aftertaste from a sugar-free ingredient, but it was fine after that. The pieces of strawberry and the mint leaves were fresh and delicious.  In all, the dinner here reminds me of why I avoid the place with my family, and only visit if it's at a friend's request.",

After leaving a Cardinals game, my friend and I decided to stop in for a snack and a beer or 3. As we drive up we see the sign...Happy Hour Daily (including Weekends) until 6:30. SWEET!! We took our seats at the patio bar and were quickly greeted and served. The happy hour menu had some great, very nicely priced options. And of course I just want the garlic fries.  The patio was great and casual and the inside was warm and contemporary but still casual. As the sun set the fire pit got going and provided some nice ambiance.   It was also on this night that I performed my good deed for the day....from out of no where came a sharp, shrill SCREAM!!!! Everyone turns in the direction of the commotion. I look over to see a man and a lady in a panicked state, jumping around....What was it? What's wrong? The whole restaurant is looking. They could barely speak, mostly pointing I see it....a very large grasshopper, about 3-4in long sitting on the edge of the lady's chair. Quickly and without hesitation, I offered my services calmly but quickly going up to the chair and capturing the grasshopper and then walking over to release it over the patio wall. The man he was embarrassed but I received a gracious \"Thank You!\" from the lady. And plenty of \"Good Job!\" from my fellow patio patrons.",

Little did we know there was a private event being held inside. There was no staff at the gate to let us know, and we walked right in through the patio. We asked a waitress once inside for directions to the bathroom, and to the hostess station (it was CRAZY PACKED inside). The waitress was super nice and helpful, directing us to where we needed to go... But she didn't mention anything about the private event. My father went to the restroom and my husband and I went to the hostess station to see how long the wait was. As soon as we get up there, the child working as the hostess asks where our wristbands are (and not in a very friendly tone) and when we look at each other and back at her, clearly we had no idea what she was talking about. Rather than politely tell one of their customers that a private event was being held, she literally said (with the most snotty raised tone possible and snarl on her face.... definitely showing her \"ghetto\" side) \"YOU NEED TO GET OUT\". We were stunned by the way she talked to us, and we politely explained our Dad was in the restroom and we would be happy to leave the moment he walks out. You would think that would be the end of it, but then the MANAGER walks up on us yelling and demanding we \"GET OUT\"! The freaking manager! My husband was pretty annoyed at this point so he point blank told her we weren't going anywhere until Dad came out, and then he went on to tell her in no way were we \"sneaking\" in, we didn't know about the private event, the gate was open, there were no employees telling us anything about the private party, and a freaking waitress directed us up front! She seemed to calm down slightly with us but then stormed off on a rampage, apparently all hell was surely going to break loose for whoever \"let\" us in. It was a complete circus and I understand there was a private event happening, but there was no indication as such when we were walking all the way through the place. Had they just politely explained there was a private event going on, we would have apologized for the mix up and left with no issue. Instead they decided they don't want us as paying customers anymore. We will never go back to this location after being yelled at and treated like criminals for trying to give them our money, regardless of how much I like their food.... It's doubtful we will ever step foot in any Gordon Biersch location again, as this experience left a terrible taste in our mouths. Bummer. But hey, we enjoyed our Chipotle instead and had a blast at the Super Bowl.",

BTW, the receptionist was GREAT!  I ordered New York strip (12 oz, med) and a mixed drink.  The steak came out in less than 5 minutes...and before my drink (the server had given me a water).  This was concerning! Well, the drink was good (old fashioned).  The steak was med rare and scrawny (flat, thin and extra skinny). Perhaps the other food is good, but other than conference people (easy to tell because it was on deafness...so signs were flying!) there were only 3 other tables at dinner time.   Another issue was that my server was constantly behind.  I waited about 10 minutes for my check while she talked with a guy staff member by the empty bar.  She was young so I still tipped her OK anyway (not great, but we've all been young and flirty).  All in all I should have went to a place called Flemings where my driver suggested for steak. Improvements: only serve food you do well, don't charge as much as a steak house (for steak) if you can't compete, keep a manager on the floor, and if a conference is in town the staff should know about it and maybe even learn something about that culture if it is so different.  I'm not deaf or hh but I could see that the staff serving those tables had culture shock!",

I was promptly greeted at the door and offered my choice of seating (Bar, cocktail lounge, dining area, or patio)  I chose to sit in the cocktail lounge and wait for my guest to arrive.  I was also quickly presented with a menu selection of dinner selections, craft brews, and wine.    That is the last time I will use the word quick in this review.  It took about 10 minutes for the server to come by and take my drink order.  She did bring a water when she took the drink order which I thought was nice but now realize that it is because it took forever for her to come back with my beer.  From the time I walked in the door to the time she brought my first beer was approx 20 minutes.  I would have understood if the Bar was hoping and they were busy, but there just wasn't anything going on that would justify the 20 minute wait.  After my guest arrived I warned her to order her drinks 10 minutes ahead of time and we were okay the rest of the evening.    The food was on par with the rest of the reviews.  I had the garlic fries, which were interesting and tasty.  She ordered asparagus and mushrooms and complained that they were a bit on the buttery side.  I was pleased with the atmosphere and the accommodations they even have a fireplace outside.  Unfortunately there is really only room enough for a small group around the fire and it was occupied.  I thought the place was pretty clean and kept up until I paid a visit to the restroom.  I can only guess as to how a public restroom in a nice establishment could be so trashed.  One of the Urinals was out of service with a trash bag over it followed by lot of littered paper towels on it.  there was toilet paper and paper towels all over the floor and sink counter.  It looked like a battle had taken place and I was looking at the fallout of TP war II.   Overall, I guess it is what you might expect from a chain attempting to pass as a unique establishment.  It really falls to the staff and management to fix the negatives that I point out.  The Beer and atmosphere were nice.  I would go again but it may not be my first choice.",

    "text": "8 of us went tonight and the service was terrible. I ordered the rib eye and it had so much fat on it that by the time I cut it off, the steak was half the size. It was about as thick as one that I'd get at Sizzler. Instead of 2 sides, I asked for a side salad at an additional $2.00 and for my second side, asparagus. On the salad, I asked for no tomatoes, no croutons, they brought the salad out with both. The asparagus was never brought out. The Kobe beef burger, which was ordered with a side of garlic fries, was given to us with a total of 13 oily, cold fries. When I was paying for the $208.00 meal, I let the waiter know I did not get the asparagus, she brought it out after I gave her the credit card to pay. She said \"here is your asparagus\". Btw, she did not reduce the charge of the salad to be a regular side even though I didn't get the second side. Not once did the manager come by to see how we were doing, even though he passed us multiple times. I am sad the meal and service was so bad because I have always liked GB.",

    "text": "Never before have I ever encountered a restaurant themed after mediocrity until dining here tonight at the Gordon Biersch restaurant. Our server, let's call him Manny, was so lifeless and chillingly disillusioned, I feared for his general well-being. The way he shuffled about on this Saturday night left much to be desired from his service skills. But enough about Manny. To the food.  The food was blandness itself. The only way to reassure myself that I was even eating food was through the mechanical motions of my mouth churning up and down and the swallow reflex. Otherwise, I'm not sure I had any experience with what could be called a meal at all. The sandwich I had was dry, like the Arizona desert surrounding this quaint little community. Its only redeeming quality was the avocado and ranch in my sandwich. However, when the taste of a sandwich stems not from the meat but from the sauces, it is a failure in my book. Condiments should be complimentary, not all-encompassing.   Praise must be given to the garlic fries, however, I was pleasantly surprised to find a whole clove of garlic had found its way into my pile of garlic fries, which I promptly scarfed down. That clove of garlic was easily the best bite of the night.  Yes, I would return to this restaurant. It was not at all a negative experience. Just a shame that the server was a zombie and the food I had ordered was a little bland. I'm sure a couple of beers with some comrades would certainly enliven the experience for a 2nd visit. As for first impressions, the restaurant has made its mark on me, and thus, I mark it back with merely 2 stars.",

Well not today at 645pm, my family 6 adults and 4 children.  When we got to the door they said all the tables were reserved?? There was a lot of empty tables. They someone came and said they could seat us. We had a very short wait of less than 5 minuets. Our drink order was taken delivered is good time. Meals were ordered and about 5 minuets after ordering our waiter came back and retook part of the order as the paper had been lost. Could happen anywhere. Not a problem. Then we waited, and waited. it was an hour before our meals were delivered. It is now 7:45pm. The food was good. Almost. I had ordered a cob salad but wanted to leave out the garbanzo beens. The waitress said yes no problem. The beans had been added. When I told the waitress she said sorry. No offer to remake. Then I said I could not eat the beans and again she said sorry. Almost like saying pick them out. That is what I did. During the time refills or water and drinks were slow to not happening for several people.  Remember we was said all the tables were reserved?? Well in the area we were there was 20 empty tables when we sat down and when  we left there was 21 empty tables.   This was not a happy meal. Service was poor, attitude was poor, food was good. I may try them again. Maybe this was the waitresses first day. It was like we don't have enough staff tonight to serve you. Hope they get it together.",

Now for the rest of the review: Dirty table - yes it was cleaned before we sat down but crumbs under the rolled napkins and on our seats  Dirty silverware. Unrolled my silverware to find food on my knife. Yuck. Food - burger was sub par and greasy. It literally was leaking out while I tried to eat and ended up having to eat it with a fork - use better quality meat -especially for the price The steak was over cooked and that is enough to ruin a good steak dinner for anyone.",

I recieved no courtesy call explaining why the order was canceled.   I contacted Grub Hub who tried to call the restaurant. They indicated that a manager was unavailable to talk. The person helping me did say that the restaurant team member indicated that they would make the order and deliver it.   So if it was possible to do then why was it canceled by the restaurant in the first place? Something is fishy.  Lets hope I get the money I prepaid back in a timely manner.

I ordered an appetizer as a meal, it was a giant pretzel, German sausage and various dipping sauces- a cheese sauce supposedly being the \"star\" dipping sauce. Sounds good right? And I mean how badly could you mess up on such a simple meal.? Pretzel was mediocre- probably the best thing on the plate honestly. The sausage was good- but it was still cold- you could tell they had thrown it in the microwave, it was warm on the outside but still cold in the middle. And the dipping sauces were nothing special, the white one was the best. The cheese dipping sauce was disgusting- almost inedible, it tasted like cheese powder and most likely was. I would only ever come back for a beer!",

The curds were delicious and went fast!  The kids had the lobster and shrimp Mac n cheese while I had the chicken schnitzel and mushroom spetzle. Both were delicious. The lobster and shrimp Mac n cheese was delicious and the kids inhaled it!  Mine was also delicious and was a huge portion. Of course you can't come here without trying a new beer. I had a mango Hefeweizen. It was very refreshing on a hot day. It went down smooth with a nice mango after taste. We only wish we weren't so full so we could've tried some dessert!",

It takes too long to have your order taken, too long for food, and heaven forbid you get any drinks refilled. The waitress acts like she has something better to do then wait on us. I try talking to her, and she is gone before i can even talk! They are not even that busy to get such bad service. The food was very good though.",

We were ready to order our food and he walked by us 3 times ignoring us. When I told the waiter it was the wrong size he said they go by another measuring system but was still charged the 21 ounce for 16 ounces.  This was a very disappointing experience. They need to be better informed",

Called for a reservations lady said they weren't busy and didn't need one so I said we will see you at 5:30.  Got there and waited 20 minutes to be seated.  Hostess wasn't friendly.  She was overwhelmed with seating and getting tables ready.  Entry way was full of people and no hostess for 5-10 minutes.  Our waiter was friendly took our order right away as we were on our way to the hockey game.  Waited a hour,  still no food.   Even prepaid our bill so we could exit quickly.  Ended up getting billed credit back to us because still no food after a hour and 10 minutes.",

I do think some of the menu items are slightly overpriced for what we received. The wonton nachos my buddy got were definitely not what you'd think of when you get nachos, very minimal on toppings. The presentation of the gluten free california burger was slightly lackluster; but still a juicy delicious hunk of meat. Overall I feel as if the effort of customer service has been not up to par as expected. When I thought of this places fantastic German influenced style; I imagined the lively bar atmosphere, this just didn't deliver. What I will say is the taste was amazing and the server did a stupendous job at keeping our drinks refilled. The place is awesomely clean and still deserving of a visit.",

The garlic fries are so delicious you will want more! Beer selection is great and you won't go thirsty! I have had the fish and chips on my first visit and the fish was the best I'd had in a long time! This time we had a double cheeseburger that was prepared to our desire!

The location is ideal --- far away from the bars, stores, and movie theater yet close enough for a short walk.  Parking here is always plentiful.  From all the times I've been here, I would say they're the busiest during dinner.  If you're lucky enough to be here at certain times, take advantage of their Happy Hour and reverse Happy Hour.  Food is generally cheaper and you get plenty of food.  I recommend the Slider Combo~  My favorite things served here:  Garlic fries, lobster bisque, and the ribeye with gorgonzola butter.  Yum!",

Food took at least 45 minutes to deliver and then chicken was missing from two salads that were ordered. Service was super slow and food was just mediocre. Then to really frustrate us they wouldn't validate our parking ticket. We won't ever go here again before a show. Not at all worth the frustration. Only positive was that the food server kept our water glasses full since it was a really hot day.",

The drink menu is extremely extensive (but you would expect that from a brewery) and the food menu seems pretty well thought out. We ordered the crab and artichoke dip and it was delicious!! I honestly hoarded if from the rest of the table and ended up filling up on it before my dinner could arrive. We also ordered the gorgonzola steak and the fish and chips. The steak was superb. Gorgonzola is a funkier cheese, so if you dont like that avoid this steak but the beef itself was cooked a perfect medium and was seasoned perfectly. The fish and chips is why I am giving this restuarant 3 stars. It was over breaded, unseasoned and dry. The fries were dry and barely seasoned as well. So being happy with 2 out of the 3 things that we ordered made for an experience that is still worthy of a redo. Give this place a try, just skip the fish and chips.",

    "text": "I was very unhappy and just downright unimpressed with this meal. I went to a G.B.'s a while ago and really liked it, so I decided I'd try again. Only this time when I went it was after the Cactus Bowl and it was a catastrophe. I was not at the game but was shopping with the family. We figured that we would eat instead of waiting in line in traffic.   This place was trashed!!! The bathroom was destroyed with that looked like urine all over the place and no towels. I immediately informed the hostess, I am not sure if it got remedied right away, but it was bad.   We got seating in a timely manner, considering, and our waitress was very pleasant and attentive. She was great.   The beer is wonderful. I loved it. Still do.   The food was so bad that I sent it back and lost my appetite. This night they had a limited menu and there was not much to choose from. I mean it was like 8-10 items, maybe. It came out fast, which makes me think they are just making it and heat-lamping it until it is ordered. But it was just bad. But for $25-$30 a plate, there is an expected level of quality that was just not there.   Now, I know that this was a special occasion, but I was just really unhappy with a $60 bill where I don't eat. It is just unnerving. I would like to pay and be fed and be happy, that's what the business is all about. I feel like a restaurant that size, in that location, knowing what was going to be happening that day, would really prepare for the tidal waves of people and make the best of it. They just couldn't keep up and it might not be fair to judge them off of this encounter. But, nevertheless, it happened.   I would like to give G.B.'s another try sometime, but it may be a while because this experience has me a little jaded.",

We questioned the server about it, and she insisted it was. We asked again, saying it did not taste like ginger ale, and her response was that she didn't make the drink.

If I hadn't been wearing jeans in 90 degree weather, I would have tried it. I sat down in the bar and immediately ordered a beer sampler. It's 5 brews for $5, but there is always a \"server's choice\" so you actually get 6 samples. I told the server to make all the selections and I can honestly say that there wasn't a beer I didn't enjoy. Then I ordered their Octoberfest special, which was a selection of sausages and olives grilled, matched with cheeses and breads, and a side of pickled vegetables. Who pickles celery!? They do, and it's scrumptious. I was stuffed. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. I only wish this was in my home town, I can guarantee I would be a regular.",

    "text": "Came to this place after an Arizona Cardinals game.  It was walking distance from the stadium and from the hotel we were staying at which was nice.  Went around 9pm which was happy hour.  Their menu for happy hour was extensive both in the amounts of alcoholic drinks and food items.  Our group ordered several cocktails and several of the food items.  Specifically I ordered the mango and pineapple Margarita which was very refreshing.  Sweet without being overly sweet with a (very) nice amount of tequila in it.  The second drink I ordered was the strawberry soda but they didn't have the strawberry rum......  so then I went with the cucumber and lime Margarita which was good but not as good as the pineapple Margarita.   Food wise we had the blue crab and artichoke dip which was just insanely out of this world.  The ratio of blue crab to dip was amazing, each scoop had at least multiple pieces of crab on it.  By far the best appetizer we tried there.  Also had 2 different types.of chicken wings, one was a Spicier blend then the other but was mediocre.  Their egg rolls too were subpar.  The pizza was forgettable.  The fried calamari I'd go back for.  Atmosphere was nice.  Definitely it felt fresh and full of energy.  Servers were attentive and conversational.  Would've given them 4 stars because you csnt run oit of crrtain ingredients for your cocktails and the appetizers were just so-so...but I left my phone there but they were observant and nice enough to hold on to it until I got back which was definitely going above and beyond what they needed to do.    Will definitely be back.",

It's by the sports stadiums so we made sure the football game was away.  Check, it should be ok.  We looked at the menu on-line, looked good. When we arrive at the restaurant, we noticed it was not busy at all.  However in the bar area the football game was on and it was on LOUD!  The host tried to seat us next to the bar area but I asked (ok, yelled so he could hear me over the noise) to be seated farther away.  We could not have possibly had any conversation in that half of the restaurant.  I watched another couple that came in after us ask to be re-seated farther away from the bar area too.  The waitress came and informed us that because a game was on, they only had a \"limited\" menu.  What???  The game is in Los Angeles!  The menu was extremely limited, nothing we had been interested in when we reviewed the menu on-line was on this limited menu.  Our overall dining experience was pretty lousy.  I'm giving two stars, the second one is because the waitress did a good job and the food we did get was tasty.  The overall dining experience rates a one star.  We both agreed we won't be returning to this restaurant.  I expected better from this chain.",

My boyfriend and I went to Gordon Biersch for a quick lunch before catching the Cardinals vs. 49ers game.  Ryan was our server.  He was fun, attentive and quick.  To start we ordered the taster size mussels and calamari, pumpkin ale and a Tito's with a splash of cranberry juice.  I feel like the minute we ordered our drinks, Ryan came back with them.  First good sign.  When he came back with our drinks, we ordered appetizers and dinner.  Our appetizer came out within 10 minutes for sure!  No complaints at all!  For lunch, I ordered the grilled Redfish with garlic mashed potatoes and a house salad with blue cheese.  My boyfriend ordered the house made shrimp tacos and sweet potato fries.  They were out of this world good.  Don't get me wrong ... the grilled, buttery, lemon-ny Redfish was great but the shrimp tacos were so good that I wanted to go back the next day to grab some for lunch.  I couldn't but I will.  I really wanted to try the garlic, parmesan fries real bad but my boyfriend love sweet potato fries better.  Ryan was kind enough to bring me an order of the garlic parmesan fries just because he's a sweetheart.  We definitely plan on visiting Gordon Biersch Brewery again and we'll request Ryan's section :)",

Our very nice waiter insisted to have it changed to a new one with no sauce. Other than the sauce, everything else was very good. Highly recommended plates are baja sauteed fish tacos, cajun pasta, garlic fries, and burgers (any) so far. Will definitely come back to try something else.",

    "text": "In a nutshell, come here if you want to dine or if you only want drinks during happy hour... NOT for the happy hour food.  Let me start off by saying that the ambiance is great: excellent lighting, decor, place settings, etc.  The bar area is like a classy sports bar and the noise-level is at a point where you can still have an intelligent conversation.  The food in the dining area is good and the service is solid.  The GB home brews are also pretty smooth and only run around $3.50 for a 22oz glass during happy hour.  The happy hour food is another story.  The Mediterranean Flat-bread and the Asian Fusion Combination are not only small, but they are also mildly gross.  The service is also very favorable to the regulars.  After you go to the Yardhouse for their happy hour, it's hard not to compare the two due to their physical proximity and since they have a semi-similar look.  However, the Yardhouse has better food, bigger sizes, and better happy hour deals.  But, GB is a decent stop if you need a break from the Yardhouse.",

    "text": "We were in Westgate and then decided to try out dinner at this place after checking out the reviews of the neighbouring restaurants. The menu looked appealing and we were not disappointed by the quality and quantity of the food. We started with Asian Chicken bites and calamari. The chicken were popcorn sized bites which sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds and had a sweet sauce like thing to dip in. The sauce complimented the bites. But the spicy lemon remoulade which came with calamari was amazing. Our server Mini was kind enough to get me another serving of this tangy dipping when I licked my first bowl clean. Next we ordered our entree. My husband had the California chicken sandwich which came with a generous serving of GB's famous garlic fries and I had a Greek flat bread. We also ordered a side of chicken BBQ slider. Personally I didn't like the BBQ sauce as it was sweet but the slider bun was soft. The sandwich was big enough for one person after sharing the appetizers and slider so we shared the sandwich and had the flat bread packed. Overall we were quite satisfied with the service and the food provided. We sure will be back to try out some more of their delicious menu.",

For starters, it's not in the stadium complex so it was easier to actually get a table and have dinner without waiting 40-50 minutes like a lot of the restaurants in the complex. Still easy to then drive over to the complex to catch a movie or get an ice cream or walk around or whatever. The service was terrific. Super friendly and helpful without being annoying. The food was great. We shared the farmhouse burger, the garlic fries, the grilled vegetable salad, and the house salad. It was all delicious. Cooked perfectly. And, again, arrived/dined/got the check all faster than the wait time at some of those other restaurants. Would go again next time I'm in that area",

We tried the beer sampler (which I recommend anyone who has never been here) and there is not a beer I wouldn't order.  My husband had the cashew chicken and I had the chicken/shrimp combo, the flavors had us debating who got the better meal. More importantly I feel that they did not skimp in meat like so many restaurants do  If there was one slight negative, I would have to say the bar was definitely backed up which didn't make sense since there we not many costumers in the restaurant. However weighing that against the positives of the night we will surely be back for more!",

My brother and I, who are very allergic to food dyes, ordered the same burger, but requested cheddar cheese instead of American, which has food dye. When our burgers arrived, they had American cheese. When we asked about this, the chef told us it was cheddar after we stated that we were allergic to American. It clearly wasn't, and sent it back to be remade after even the waiter agreed that it was clearly American cheese. When the new burger arrived, I noticed a small amount of cheese on the side of my burger, and decided to check under the new cheddar slice out of curiosity. It turns out, the chef just scraped the cheese off the top of both burgers, leaving a considerable amount of the cheese still on, and covered it with cheddar. Although the waiters and management were respectful during this ordeal, the fact that the chef could be so negligent when allergies are involved shocks me. If anyone special orders any meal at this location, I highly suggest double checking the food yourself.",

I am a huge fan of garlic and the fries were just heavenly!!!  Crispy fries tossed with garlic, parm cheese and parsley, ohhhhh YUM.....  I NEVER finish my fries, I finished these!!!  Our server was very pleasant and attentive.  The hostess was very pleasant also.  Service was quick. Definitely recommend this place if your in the area.",

The service from Justin and Charlene was excellent and efficient! This was the perfect gathering spot for a small celebration. I've been here before and never disappointed.

    "text": "Well, for a Saturday afternoon I was curious why there were few customers. Now I know.  The food was a complete disappointment. I started with a stuffed chicken breast accompanied by a quinoa rice pilaf and vegetables. The chicken prep was unexpected. Pre-cut into 4 separate pieces and the sun dried tomatoes mixed in with the cheese was overpowering. Reminded me of a pre-cooked chicken dish you can buy at Costco's freezer section. Their sides did not complement the chicken at all and the pilaf was completely cold. Turns out that's intentional.   Sent this back and went onto Round 2 with the fish and chips selection. This was a complete miss as well. The cod was as tasteless as tofu. I suppose they use a Panko breading to attempt to jazz it up but it was a major fail. The coleslaw was the only thing I enjoyed.   Waste of time and money.",

My colleagues and I were in town for a convention all week and decided to stop by last Sunday night due to this restaurant being the closest place to eat. The food was pretty good the first night  but what made us come 3 of the.next 4 nights was extrodianary  service and pleasant conversation by a new server to Gordon Biersch, his name was Matt. When you go to this place ask for him he is the best server we have ever had in any state we have visited.  He told us he had just started there this month and we didn't believe him. His personality, knowledge of the menu and keen observance (remembered my order from the night before to the T even asked me if I wanted no tomatoes like the night before)made us feel he had been there for years. In the 7 nights we were in town we came to Gordon 4 of those nights and I had a Ribeye, French Dip Sliders, Grilled Steak Salad and a burger and they were all great.  I will definitely come back to this place next time I am in town. Thank you Gordon Biersch and Matt for the excellent dinners out in Arizona. See you soon.",

    "text": "My previous visits were colored with lacking luster service. This time, our server, Stephanie was fabulous. She was attentive and treated us like royalty.  When we arrived, we were pleased that even though it was a game night, they had plenty of seating to accommodate us on a Saturday night. Even though we could've taken advantage of the Happy Hour deals at the bar, we chose to celebrate our anniversary meal in the comfort and quiet of a booth in the dining section.   Tip: On game nights, Gordon Biersch does not take reservations. However, we were seated immediately.  Tip: Sign up for Gordon Biersch emails. They have fabulous email coupons and deals. We had a buy one entree get one free that we used that night.  We wanted a beer. Hubby prefers a Pilsner. We asked for the list of GB craft beers. She brought us samples of the Blitzen, Marzen and the Golden Export. Hubby liked the Golden Export best. It was a light, clean and crisp brew. The Blitzen was pretty good. We both found the Marzen a little too hoppy and bitter. Stephanie heard that I liked darker brews and was deferring to hubby so she brought several darker samples as well: Schwartzbier (dark and robust) and the Hefweizen.  Stephanie was kind enough to split our full pour into 2 glasses.  For dinner, hubby and I enjoyed the ribeye steak. I had mine with the gorgonzola butter, garlic fries and crimini mushroom spatzle. I love the garlic fries. It is really crisp and garlicky. I loved how tender my steak was, but I wasn't a fan of the gorgonzola butter. A great steak should not be overpowered by anything. The crimini mushroom spatzle was yummy at first, but got cold super fast.  Hubby had a perfect medium rare steak without any butter. Stephanie was kind enough to fulfill our request for having sauces on the side: au jus, red wine reduction and she even brought out a garlic-gorgonzola sauce. The au jus and reductions were to die for. I enjoyed it so much with each bite of steak. The garlic-gorgonzola wasn't as nice with the steak, but I enjoyed livening up the spatzle. Hubby had garlic mash with the meal and a side salad which he didn't really care for. The salad was unremarkable. We tried the jalapeno ranch which had a little more flavor than the regular ranch.   The shocker of the evening was the garlic mashed potatoes which came out cold. We told Stephanie, and she remedied it immediately. I told you our server was fabulous!  We ended the evening taking home a Growler of Golden PIlsner as a gift for our neighbor.  Tip: Old Black Friday, GB had an amazing deal of $50 for 1 year's fill for Growlers. That's a refill of a Growler per week. What  a deal! Bad for the waistline but great for the soul!",

I'm Giving them three stars because of The food . It's very basic . There is nothing on the menu specifically the burgers that scream unique . I got the Gb burger and had to add bacon and avocado because there wasn't any burgers that came with that already , the burger was cooked well. But it's too dry it needs a some sort of sauce they don't have chipotle mayo not even a thousand island dressing",

I was impressed with the chicken as it was not fried to a crisp and was juicy and different than most other si called Asian chicken. The beer selections were more geared towards IPA's and such. I had the Marzen and found it very refreshing. 3 stars for now as I have yet to sample the regular menu.",

I'm not a fan of their whole menu and how expensive everything is, but I don't mind sitting up at the bar, garbing a few small bites and chasing them down with some craft brews. But if you are looking for a nice meal and maybe a date night this place isn't bad for that either.",

She forgot a drink and we didn't see her for awhile to remind her for it. Then one of us had tacos and asked for flour tortillas but got both a flour tortilla wrapped around the hardshell which kind of defeats the purpose... plus the flour tortilla tasted a bit stale. I had ordered the ahi nachos and asked for no jalapenos, i have a slight jalapeno allergy, luckily my allergy is super minor because she left the jalapenos on the nachos and i had to pick them off. Also one of us ordered salt and pepper fries but ended up getting garlic fries... so overall some of our food was excellent some not so much, service was sub-par. I would try it again to give them another shot but i definitely don't suggest the lobster and shrimp tacos because at 20$ for a plate, it was not good.",

    "text": "Here's a short story about a beer... A really good, delicious, seasonal beer.  I was invited to join some friends for dinner at the Gordon Biersch Brewery in Glendale this past week. When I arrived, they were all drinking, but no one was eating. I've dined at a few different Gordon Biersch locations, so I already know the food is good. This review, however, is just about the beer.  Gordon Biersch beer could, and did, suffice for my dinner. And it gets better every time I try it. The beer that caught my eye, and delighted my taste buds, was the seasonal Pumpkin Ale. It's light, spicy, and refreshing with a hint of cinnamon. In fact, it was one of the best ales I've ever tried.  One thing I highly recommend, is to enjoy the beers on tap at the nearest Gordon Biersch. It's way better than purchasing the bottles in the store. Plus you get the atmosphere and camaraderie of your friends. Or the manager, Amy, who came by our table to see if we were enjoying ourselves. We were. And we will be back for more. Cheers!",

    "text": "I'm going to be honest, the food looked delicious when it arrived and I was super stoked to eat it. That being said, it was barely edible. All the food fell into one of three flavor categories: overwhelming garlic, overwhelmingly dill, or overwhelmingly salty. I literally could not taste any of the entree's, sides, or appetizers that we order as all of them were burning underneath the seasoning. The garlic fries would have been amazing with about 1/5 of the seasoning. There was literally so much garlic and salt on them that you couldn't even see the French Fry. Even the ranch dip that came with my daughters carrot sticks was disgusting, as all you could taste was the Dill that they added to the dressing. This meal left me hungry, dying of thirst, and wondering if we weren't just the victim of an unhappy employee in the kitchen who was trying to get on unemployment.",

Darn, did get the Super Hostess's name....rides the cute mini bike, but our waitress, Renee, was amazing. Their patio is doggy friendly and our Sadie enjoyed napping under our table. The Mediterranean Pizza....oh my goodness!! Even our Amazon Parrot, Cisco sez the pizza crust...yummy! My Sweetie had the fab sausage plate. Everthing....OUTSTANDING, we shall return. Our only suggestion would be to hose down the Patio, our Sadie....got a tad dirty. But hey, she and we ENJOYED!",

When we sent one thing back (no one wanted to wait any longer for theirs) the kitchen blamed it on the cheese being placed on top.   Not sure how a few chunks of mozzarella cheese make Chicken  and rice ice cold.    We watched half of our food sit in the pick up window for over 20 minutes.  I would blame the slow kitchen on the place being busy But 3/4 of the restaurant was empty.  They had maybe 5 tables with customers.   Positive Our waitress Andrea was good.

First part of the party shows up on time but they advise they won't seat us until entire party is here even though the section where we were eventually seated had multiple open tables. We were finally seated at about 5:30. They told us we would have 2 servers, ok great. So we wait for the servers and we wait and we wait. 20 minutes after being seated they finally arrive for our drink order, we place that as well as the order for appetizers. The servers brought the drinks fairly quickly and we ordered our dinner. Servers advised us the appetizers would be out shortly. We continued to wait. At 6:30 after being seated for an hour and being at the restaurant for over an hour we have no appetizers or food. At this point we're all hangry, we just tell the server to bring the bill for the drinks and cancel our order. Ridiculous! They at least comped our beers but very disappointed. I have been to other locations and this has never happened. Needless to say we won't be back. My parents enjoyed popcorn and pretzels at the coyotes game for their anniversary dinner. I would have given 0 stars but it wouldn't let me.",

It was overall a positive experience, I gave one extra star because of the great customer service experience, I really was impressed by the initiative they took to keep us happy, they didn't even wait for a complaint or a frowny face, they just remedied a situation that they knew wasn't acceptable... good for them.",

I was immediately greeted by the hostess as soon as I came in this evening as I headed to the bar. The venue was not crowded with a steady flow of customers that could easily be managed. The two minute bar rule was a total wash this round because I was finally approached by the bartender five minutes later. He was extremely friendly and quick to make me a drink. I ordered the house Rootbeer which was not anything special to sip on but I accepted the drink anyways. I started with an appetizer that came out quickly and tasted well but my main entree was wrong. Since I am not a fan of sending food back I decided to slide my plate over to a friend who met up with me to munch on. Instead of placing a completely different order I decided not to eat at all. I realize I am just not a fan of this place. My last experience was the worst Resturant experience I have ever encountered I guess I can't let it go.   I gave this establishment one more star for being clean and really trying hard to get things right.   Some friendly suggestions to make this work in the future. The manager walked the venue but never checked in or said hello to the guest. That was odd. As slow as it was I feel the manager should have checked on the tables. Two if the food is wrong and you clearly noticed the order is messed up FIX IT.",

They had just rolled out their new cheese curds appetizer and the waiter was new himself and was just as amazing as the appetizer. It was golden and crispy outside with gooey cheese inside and big chunks of this spicy bacon to die for. The food and service was soo good that we went back every other Friday night for about 2 months or so. We sometimes got our server and he always remembered us and the kids and it was a great feeling to come to a place and be known. We did notice however that the food wasn't always the same going back. They took off our oldest son's favorite meal and the cheese curds (which we ordered every time) were smaller and sloppier and the bacon was non existent. We have not been back since then. Oh, and one last thing for all you restaurants that serve this: STOP PUTTING KRAFT MAC AND CHEESE ON THE MENU!! I CAN MAKE IT AT HOME FROM A BOX FOR LESS THAN $1.50!! I REFUSE TO LET MY KIDS ORDER THIS, HOW HARD IS IT TO MAKE YOUR OWN!",

They used to have a vast beer selection that was affordable ($2-3off happy hr) but now during happy hour you only get $1 off beers which is such a misleading \"Happy Hour\".  Being the brewery that it is I would have expected to come in and get the pilsner I always get there, but now they don't even carry a pilsner... What kind of \"brewery\" doesn't carry such a common type of beer??  I never thought I'd be leaving a negative review for Gordon Biersch but they have forever lost my business.",

I should have taken it as a sign that we got seated immediately on a Saturday night and there were plenty of empty tables. The service was slow, they offered to bring ranch dressing and never showed up. The portion sizes are tiny and over-priced. One fish taco for $5 was smaller than I've seen at any other place. The grass fed beef sliders were $14 bucks and the size of silver dollars or maybe even smaller.  Bottom line: we won't be back. There are too many other places to eat that are way better!

    "text": "Updated 6/7/19: I updated my review to just 1 star because regardless of what was on my credit card receipt that I signed, they submitted a higher charge to my company. I put in a dispute (and I have my signed copy as proof). I originally had given them 3 stars for the food I received, but after the crappy and lazy service received and the fact that they charged my credit card WRONG I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone going here. I am leaving my original review below in case anyone plans to go and pay cash so they can see what the atmosphere and food is like. I personally will NOT be back.   I went here today (6/5) for lunch with my employees. (Week day right around 1115am) The place was not crowded at all and the hostess was missing from the stand when we walked in. It took several minutes for her to show up. When she finally sat us, it took the waitress awhile before she came and took our drink order. The waitress seemed a little scattered because when she brought our drinks out she said I will give you more time (when we didn't want it) and walked off and took the drink AND food order of the table next to us. Then when one of our party asked for sweetener for her drink she said \"sorry we don't have that.\" Total Falsehood, I could see it at her server stand and went and got some for our table when she walked off to figure out why it was taking 15 minutes for the 1 beer we ordered. After we were able to order it surprisingly did not take too long for the food to come out. The fact that the food was pretty good is what honestly saved this review. I ordered the BBQ Burger with regular fries and it was really good. All in all the service was subpar and very disappointing, but the food was good. I am undecided on whether I will be back or not. Not really sure it is worth the cost to have crappy service.",

Sat in bar and had to wait for server(finally stopped someone cuz wanted to get on the happy hour deal)... Someone finally came took our order, brought us water... Was also helping 2 big tables... Our appetizers came(plates were hot, food was warm)... We ordered our food(Asian chicken bites & baked salmon)...and it took FOREVER to get to us... To the point I asked waiter if they were plucking my chicken and catching my son's fish... 15 min after that convo... Our food came AGAIN just warm food... Was tough getting refills. Was extremely frustrating when asked for our bill and waiter told us to wait, he be a few minutes straightening other tables Bill(the huge 2 party table)... Instead of getting me our bill real fast we sat and waited and waited and WAITED!!!! I then asked another server to get manager... Which he came, told him issues and he offered to take off an appetizer(oh big deal, they was cheap from happy hour)... So $9.00 was taken off and bartender had come over and cashed us out... I am so disappointed in not only the service, food and the manager... I mean seriously something more shoulda been done... I'm not sure if we will come back... This place is our favorite to go spot when wanting to chill & enjoy the evening... This visit was BEYOND stressful... Oh, and I have a Gordon's club card that I mentioned several times and I didn't even get my points for our meal... Step it up Gordon's!!!!!",

    "text": "*Update. Second verse, worse than the first.   Place was empty during Holiday season, still took 20 minutes to be seated (should have left then). Ordered my food & wine as a pair. 10 minutes later, \"We're out of that wine\". Forgot my husband's beer, told us the dish I ordered came with a free side, charged us for it on the bill. Food arrived, over cooked, super soggy vegetables smothered in salt & butter and overall disappointing. A HUGE waste of a $140 family Christmas dinner.   Bottom line? Gordon Biersch, the new Red Robin. No offense Red Robin.   It's   prime patio season here in The Valley of the Sun which means it's time to head outdoors for lunch. This location is in the busy shopping center at West Gate in Glendale, AZ. Today there happened to be a Coyotes hockey game here at the arena so service was a little slow. Friendly and accommodating but slow.   We were seated and greeted promptly and our drinks were brought out fairly quick. Our food took a long time to reach us however.   My husband & boys age 11 & 12 ordered custom grilled burgers. I ordered \"smoked\" chicken Tostadas which turned out to be grilled chicken with smoke seasoning in lettuce wraps. I was happy with the lettuce instead of corn tortillas but disappointed in the over grilled, not smoked chicken. They proved to be pretty tasty otherwise especially with the pickled red onions, yum!!  The hamburgers were huge on fresh, grilled, buttered buns and came with advertised \"endless fries\" either garlic or salt and pepper. They were thick cut and delicious but ran out of the small side serving quickly and waited over 20 minutes for another batch to arrive by which time we were over it.   Bottom line?  Good quality food and beer, nice patio, very friendly customer service, much too long of a wait for food!! Would I come again? Probably not to this location on a weekend",

Service could be a little better, they were quite slow at times and was hard to find when needed them.    The food was not bad at all.  The portions were way too small for the price.  The legendary garlic fries was quite delicious, the steak tacos were decent and the grass-fed beef sliders weren't bad at all.  We also ordered a pizza and a few other things I can't seem to remember. Their coke was quite good, the glass was sweating all over the place.  Must had been warm in there.   After I finished my food I used the loo.  The loo needed to be picked up, toilet paper and paper towels could be seen lying all over the place. The design of the loo was horrible.  When you walk in and make a turn left there the urinal is.  All out in the open.  Now I am a rather large guy here, and if I had used the urinals the whole world will see me and I'll probably end up on America most wanted show.  And if someone was washing their hands in the sink the mirror will reflect and hit the open urinals too, who the hell made that bathroom.  I couldn't risk it so i used the stalls instead.    Overall a decent place, but probably will not return to this location.",

Had the crab & artichoke dip for an appetizer. Had the lobster & shrimp Mac & cheese for the meal. Both were tasty (Mac & cheese could have been a little cheesier, but I'm from Wisconsin where we like our cheese!) Also had a stout beer that was great!",

They were both exceptional and the portions were large. For our main course my husband had the sausage platter and I had a cod.       The cod was so good!! The batter was perfect, not too thick and cooked to a perfect gold brown. I paired it with more of the garlic fries because they were so delicious. My husband had the sausage platter with rice and slaw. He said he really enjoyed the sausage and rice. The only thing that was not a home run was the slaw. My husband did not care for the sweet undertone.       The wait staff was also on point. He was very attentive and on point. Can't wait to go again and try more of the appetizers!",

    "text": "My friend MM and I came here for dinner since it was close to our hotel and we figured it would be a safe option as a popular franchise restaurant. It is located in the Westgate entertainment complex with multiple other restaurants and plenty of parking. We were seated rather quickly at a booth, which was nice. But then the waiting began.  My theory is that one of the servers cancelled their shift at the last minute, because that's the only explanation I have for the amount of waiting we did. We waited a long time to order food, we waited a long time to get our food, we waited a long time to get our check... there was a lot of waiting involved. And the restaurant was not even packed! Therefore I think that someone cancelled their shift at the last minute and our server had to handle more tables than normal and that is why we had to wait so long for everything. If this was not the case, then it was just shitty service and I would prefer to give our server the benefit of the doubt, especially since she was quite nice every time we did interact with her.  I started off my evening with their BOURBON PEACH SMASH ($8.99), which has Maker's Mark, peach puree, and lemon lime sour. I thought I had taken a photo of it but I guess I just really needed a drink and I forgot to. Sorry! The drink was decent... I don't really have much to say about it.  For my meal I got their CALIFORNIA BURGER ($11.99), which has crushed avocado, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, 1000 Island dressing. It also comes with either your choice of side of their Infinite Legendary Garlic Fries. With a name like that, of course I had to get the Infinite Legendary Garlic Fries! I was happy with my burger--I love avocado and all the ingredients went together quite well. The garlic fries were delicious; I love garlic and they were quite generous with it. Since they are Infinite I also got a second serving of the fries, although I felt bad that I didn't finish them.  My friend ordered a burger as well, and he added bacon to it. The burger came out without bacon, so we flagged our server down and asked that she make sure that we do not get charged for the bacon. MM heard her tell someone to take off the bacon charge, but I guess that someone did not listen, since the $1.59 charge for bacon was there on the receipt when we got the bill! So we had to wait some more to flag our server down again, then wait some more for her to bring the corrected bill, and then wait some more for her to bring back the bill and our credit cards. All the waiting left my friend pretty bitter, so he was definitely not a fan of this place. He would probably give them 2 stars, but I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and I did enjoy my food and drink, so I will give them 3 stars. They were okay.",

Gordon Biersch has HH every day and night of the week!!   I HIGHLY recommend the following: *Apple Bread Pudding!! AMAZEBALLS!!! It seriously tastes like french toast with spiced maple syrup which in actuality is their whisky sauce. *Garlic Fries. *BBQ Chicken Pizza w/light bbq sauce. (SUPERB!)  I very much love the atmosphere and the outdoor fireplace. Its so comforting and relaxing.",

The fries had to be returned because there was hardly any garlic on them. Previous visits around the country usually had too much garlic, so this was strange. The second version was better, but the garlic needed to be cooked, not thrown in raw. Pizza was decent, but undercooked.       The outdoor patio was the best part as we had the fake Fireplace area to ourselves after 10pm. Kelsey was also very nice as our waitress. The new beer that they featured also was tasty - something with an M in the name. Join the passport club and get $10 credit for next visit.      My date was Jolly from YELP - my first yelp pickup.

The bar area was full, but not packed, and had maybe 3 or 4 servers, which wasn't quite enough.   We couldn't get anyone to actually approach our table to take our orders. The two times we were able to actually order anything, we had to flag someone down. It's like we were invisible. The tables around us were getting service, but no luck for us.   When my friend's drink finally arrived there was a bug floating in it. Again, when we FINALLY were able to flag someone down and tell her that there was a bug in the drink, she looked at us as though she pitied us for not understanding the value an insect can add to a cosmo, gave us the sympathetic head tilt and said, \"ummm...it's a fruit fly.\" Oh, well then. I didn't realize. I thought it was a bug, but now that I know it's a FRUIT FLY, I'd like to keep it. In fact, do you have a few more you could sprinkle atop my beverage? Thanks.  At least they didn't charge her for the drink. Oh, wait. THEY DID. Yes, we got to pay for the fruit fly cosmo, because, well, FRUIT FLY.

I tasted his garlic fries and they did,t have much flavor,but most of all were not real hot and not crispy, Just a kind of hardness.  Nothing to look at or tempt me to eat more. I had the Kobe burger and will never have another. It looked hard and dark and was not juicy at all.  Maybe a burger  really should have some fat or they don't know what they are doing .  I never use ketchup, but had to drown this burger in it for some flavor.  Yuk! I so wish I would have sent it back, but our server was so nice.  This place is over priced and could take a lesson from Cheesecake Factory where everything is consistently GOOD.     Thank God we had a birthday coupon and got a break on the bill.  Free chocolate cake that was not moist except for the frosting.  Will never go back.    We don't care about the beer.",

However the bread was (almost) rock hard...talk about \"day old bread.\"   The server was very attentive and was super knowledgeable about their selection of beers. My hubs had the beer flight and she very clearly and concisely offered the details of each brew. He enjoyed all of them...but the Schwartzbier was his favorite. And those garlic fries...for a garlic lover like me...they are a delight!  Overall the experience was just fine...but I honestly think YardHouse is SOO much better!",

I was hesitant they would be able to accommodate our group because I was given short notice but was able to make a reservation the evening before. Knowing very well what to expect from GB, I dealt with a young lady named Becca who made my whole experience so great that I had to hop online to write up a review! Becca was incredibly helpful by answering all my questions and assured me the server would be notified and able to give us all separate checks (ugh so annoying I know, but corporate insisted on it for individual expense reports). The evening was a breeze and because of her willingness to deal with us, all 25 of us are expecting to return when we all meet back up in town. While I'd assume this location is generally busy with its' location to the stadiums, it's nice to know this customer service still exists and we all walked away talking about our great experience well into the next day during training! Thank you!",

    "text": "We came here after a (very) long day trip to the Grand Canyon... didn't walk in until close to 10 PM. The bar was fairly dead due to the U2 concert being held down the block, which was A-OK for me. Obviously with a name like Gordon Biersch, German-style beers are the mainstay, including Hefes, Schwarzbiers, and others.  For beer, I started off with the Golden Export (which went surprisingly well with my very large pulled pork sandwich) and later had a Schwarzbier. Both were pretty darn good.  The food was made pretty quickly, though I don't know how much of that had to do with the U2 concert and/or the time of night. Our server was friendly and even asked if my dad wanted only half a slice of double-fudge cake since it was so big. The pork sandwich was very flavorful and the coleslaw lining the lower bun contrasted perfectly with the tangier barbecue sauce. I wasn't sold on the chips, though. They were hot, but they were bland, even with the bit of seasoning they came with.  I'd go back, sure, but I think I prefer Four Peaks more. I'm willing to give GB the benefit of the doubt on the chips, as maybe it was an off-night or just with being so late or whatever. But even though I like the styles of beer they have, I like the wider variety the Peaks locations have.",

I had the kobe cheeseburger which was a little bland and the fries seemed as if they had spent a few  rounds in the deep fryer. If I had known they didn't have the capability to blend my margarita I wouldn't have bothered. My boyfriend had the steak frites which looked like it has been regurgitated by a baby bird onto some fries. Towards the end of the meal the waiter was getting a little short tempered and we had to ask another waiter to bring us the dessert menu. Took 15 minutes just to get two desserts. Will probably not be going back. This is more of place to have some beer and watch a game. We called the manager and were told that he would be giving us a gift card for $140. I also did the online survey and received an e-mail from the district manager, I told him that the restaurant manager was taking care of the problem. 3 weeks later and I receive a gift card for $50, umm ok that didn't even cover what we spent on two out of four people. Food and management could use a renovation. If you are looking for a really good meal go to The Yard House right across from the theater.",

Our beginning of the evening started off very pleasant and the server/bartender was excellent!  After an hour and a half she informed us that she would be leaving as her shift was over!  We wanted to settle the bill with her since she had handled our orders and had provided excellent customer service.  The three of us continued to stay for another hour and half and not once were we approached by a server to ask if we needed anything else.  We needed another drink and our water glasses were empty the entire time!  As we left I asked to see the manager as I wanted to bring this to his attention.  As I explained the situation to him he didn't seem at all concerned and just said \"I'm sorry\".  The place was practically empty and he didn't even care about good customer service!!!!  Needless to say we are going to be taking our once a week venture someplace else where they are concerned with customer service!!",

The first visit was a nice surprise, and we were very pleased with our meals.  Today, not so much.  The New York strip steak was hardly pink at all and was dry.  A restaurant of that caliber should not have to rely on customers to send back their over cooked food.  The Stir-fry with shrimp was way over drenched with Teriaki sauce and the small shrimps were tough.  The house salad was very good and the mashed potatoes and chopped vegetables were good.  The crab artichoke dip with garlic toast was very tasty.  So it was not a total loss.  We had the $10 gift card given out on our 1st visit, but the waiter did not take it off because, \"we had to tell him it had $10 on it\".  So watch that if you go for a second visit.  Will we go back?...well, there is still the $10 credit...maybe.",

I am not sure what the happy hour prices were but lets just say that the martinis were $5, according to our waitress. I asked what kind of martinis they had and decided on the lemon something or other. My husband ordered the house brew that was recommended by the server.  When the drinks came mine was very yummy. The husband took a nice big drink and thought it was yummy too ( not his words, though). After he put the glass down after taking a drink I noticed that there was some things floating in the glass. We were not sure what it was...it looked like just a bunch of debris floating around. He almost lost it. We showed the server and she was very sorry and returned with a new one. I ordered 2 martinis and he finished his beer and did not feel like having another so we asked for the bill. When I looked on the bill I noticed that the drinks were not the prices that she had stated when we came in and aasked about the specials. The beers was $2 more than she quoted...and my martinis were not $5...they were $9.50. Just at that moment the manger came by and asked how we were doing, I asked about the bill and was told that the happy hour price was for a smaller glass than what my husband had and that only the house martinis were $5 and mine were not house martinis.   When the husband ordered the beer he asked what is the happy hour special...what do you recommend...and that is what she brought. Same thing about the martinis. I felt schwindled. He adjusted it. Thanks .  We did not order any food, but the menu was very pricey. That better be some good eats!!!",

I hate to be overly critical of the service at restaurants when they're slammed, but I felt the delays here were beyond what is expected.  We were told the wait time would be 35 minutes, but it was really 45. This is one of my biggest pet peeves--I feel a restaurant should never underestimate wait times, so that customers can make an informed decision about whether to wait or not.   One of the diners in my party is a vegetarian, and ordered a veggie burger. Thirty minutes after we placed our order, the server came back and told her the restaurant was out of veggie patties.  I can see no reason why the restaurant would not have discovered this for thirty minutes, other than that the restaurant did not start to prepare our order for thirty minutes. It then took about another thirty minutes for our food to come. I think it's unexcusable for a restaurant to take sixty minutes to serve food to customers once they're seated, no matter how busy. However, the beer here is always delicious, and the food is fine.",

We had a special \"deal\" of $17 because we were such a big party.  There were soft drinks included in the price, but alcohol was more.  I have no issue with this, but the food was not very good.  I had a pasta dish and it was fine, but I am not dying to eat it again.  Then, we get our bills.  The price was not $17, there was additional tax and tip added on (which again is fine, but deceptive when we were told it would be $17 per person).  Then, my pregnant friend had a cranberry juice and sparkling water.  This apparently was not on the included menu and she was charged a $2 alcohol fee for her non-alcoholic beverage.  It just seemed a bit fishy to me.  Had it been an excellent meal, I wouldn't care about a few bucks, but it was just ok.",

    "text": "Talk about a disaster! We arrived after the Monday Night Football game, so we assumed the wait and service would be suspect, but this place made a joke of our already-low expectations.   The host told us the wait would likely be 20-30 minutes, unless we wanted first-come seating in the bar. Nothing was open in the bar at the time, so we figured the wait would be reasonable. We put our name in and took a seat in the waiting area.  During our wait, we watched various people come up to the host from the bar area saying they hadn't had anyone wait on them. One waitress came up a few moments later huffing and snatched two menus to take to the one couple's table.  One guy walked by us on his way out and said they sat him and he sat there for 30 minutes and never even saw a waiter or even got a glass of water. His words? \"The service here is HORRIBLE.\"  At that point, we had already waited for 20 minutes, and with no improvement on our status, combined  with those customer warnings, we decided to just order food to-go. We placed an order with the host and he ran off to put it in.   We had hoped that would work out. Well, 30 more minutes goes by...nothing. We ask the host how long the wait would be for our takeout order and he said \"probably another 30 minutes...\" For salads? Wow. We left.  The overall rating for this place should've been warning enough, but as one of the places open later on a Monday, it seemed a fair risk for some post-game food. Apparently this location has no idea how to run or staff a restaurant for such a busy area. By far, the worst experience I've ever had...and we didn't even get a chance to taste the typically-average fare GB is known for. It's a shame we can't get a refund for that wasted hour of our lives.",

    "text": "Stopped by before the Coyotes game the other night. Place was bustling and initially the host wanted to seat the 2 of us at a 6 top table. There was a nice little booth in the next section over and I asked if we could sit there as I'd hate to waste a big top table like this on just the two of us. We were accommodated but warned that the server in that section had a big table and so there might be a wait. We didn't mind. We weren't in a hurry.  Well thank goodness we weren't in a hurry because we never met the server for that section. Not once. Luckily husband struck a repoire with the manager when we asked about the smaller table because after 20 minutes of no contact whatsoever from anyone, it was he who came and took our order. The food runner was the one to fix our incorrect order and find the beers at the bar for us that we'd ordered. I guess we shoulda taken the big top after all. It was the food runner who brought us our bill. And it was the food runner who we tipped in cash because he deserved it. But not once did the actual server for that section come to see us.   It was an ok visit and the southwest nachos were delish. I'd go back if only just for those. :)",

Ambiance- very nice upscale place. What you would expect.   Good- fiance got the Gastro pub burger that was delicious! It had bacon jam and arugula and blue cheese. It was cooked perfectly. I got the artisan grilled cheese. It said it had avocado mayo and like four different kinds of cheese. This thing was CHEESY! A little too cheesy without enough avocado flavor to break up the heavy cheese and butter taste. I couldn't taste the mayo at all. It needed some tomato or arugula or actual avocado to break up the cheese. This paired with the garlic fries was just too much. I could only eat half.   Drinks- the Belgian ipa was very good! It was hoppy but not toooo hoppy. The house made root beer was delicious!   Overall we liked this place ! Next time I will order the cioppino which sounded amazing.",

GB has a relaxing atmosphere and I admire  the decor on the inside of the restaurant,  with all the subtle references to beer.  The server's at GB are always very helpful and take the time to review the menu and explain the various selection of beers offered. The menu at GB is large with a great selection of appetizers.  If you like fries, then you should sample the garlic fries. These fries are addictive, made with fresh pressed garlic, and pair nicely with  beer. If fries aren't for you, then the Blue Crab Artichoke Dip, or Ahi Tuna  is an absolutely must.  I enjoyed several of the Marzen Beers and we finished our meal with a delicious Warm Apple Bread Pudding. I look forward to my next visit to GB in the future. The prices are fair,  the menu is appealing, and the customer service is great.",

I was not expecting so much garlic but they turned out great. Our meals were equally satisfying. (Pictures posted)  I ordered the schwarzbier, being a big fan of trying new beers. And I figured it was a brew house so why not. Easily one of the best I've ever had.   Price. I expected the price to be a bit high. It was, but for the price I can say it was worth it.   Ambience. Fresh. Modern. Clean.   Service. Here's the only disappointing part about our visit. The waitress talked very little to us and hardly spared a smile. She was not rude per se, but not overly friendly. It was not enough to damper my experience.   Overall. I can't say the trip was perfect, but l was very satisfied with GB and will return in the future.",

I liked how they knew what each beer had to offer and they gave suggestions based on things you like. My dinner was delicious. The garlic fries are totaly amazing. They were refillable which can be a dangerous thing for me lol. I would eat and eat them all night long, even though I was stuffed with just one serving. Thankfully I have a little willpower.

First when you order drinks they should be delivered at the same time. I ordered the California burger with bacon, I received a small burger tasted ok not outstanding at all. The bun was burnt and burger patty was very small. There was support to be thousand island  dressing but I don't think there was even a half teaspoon between both buns and had to ask for mayonnaise just so I could swallow the burger.The fries were the best part of the meal. I had to ask for my drink to be refilled. My husband ordered the chicken and pasta dish he said it was so so not the best by far. The fact that we both walked right past the manager who never even acknowledged that we were in the restaurant was sad. I was not impressed at all..",

    "text": "This place has so much potential however the attitude of the female servers coupled with the inefficiency of the kitchen with timing during a rush is bringing this place down. I was in Arizona for a conference in Glendale at the arena which is about a 10 minute walk from this place. My colleague and I made reservations through OpenTable for lunch to ensure we could get in and get sat and eat and get back to the conference on time considering there was over 10,000 people at the conference. We entered for our 12:30 reservation at 12:25pm the female hostess was very unwelcoming however Martin and Kenny were nearby and extremely friendly and accommodating. We were offered a HighTop table in the bar area (worst decisions EVER). Our waitress came over PIST and the only reason I can think she was acting such a way is because of the rush and they didn't get the memo that our organization was in town and it would be super busy. My colleague mind you is pregnant and we nicely let the server know that we were on a lunch break and we would like to order soon. She rolled her eyes and said okay and walked away only to return about 10minutes later. We ordered: Mushroom app Shrimp Mango taco Side Salad  FastForward 49 minutes later, WE HAVE NO FOOD. We ask our server several times and she says \" it's busy\" we are like \"ok we understand that but a side salad and a shrimp mango taco appetizer and mushrooms don't take that long\" She disappeared again for 20 minutes, now we have been here for over an hour with no water, no drinks and no food. I walked up front and spoke to Martin who immediately grabbed Kenny who magically got us our food in the next 6 minutes and comped our bill. This was nice however we lost all the time we had for lunch and to take a walk waiting on 3 small items for over a hour. The food however was AMAZINGLY good which is why we returned the next day for dinner in hopes that the staff was different and to our liking it was. David the host was the FUNNIEST and our server MATT was a True ACE. For dinner we had Lobster tacos and chicken tacos which both were so fulfilling and flavorful. Again the food is good and the service is HIT or MISS, all the people I listed are AMAZING but the women there are just OFF.",

The cheese curds were $15 and they were bland... seriously nothing special.  Even the soda pop was low on flavor and tasted blah.    Last night was my one cheat meal for the week and it was a waste, I was totally bummed I wasted it for this place.

First impression was that our waitress hated her job! She wasn't friendly or didn't have a smile when she came to our table. I felt like she didn't want to be there. I ordered Grilled Redfish and what I received was a dried filet of fish that was total salt! My kale salad was the opposite! No flavor at all to it. The best part was the vegetables! For a price of over $15.00 I would have expected something tasty. The waitress NEVER asked me about my meal and since I didn't eat it I think she should have said, was everything ok??  My husband asked me not to complain as he just wanted to leave an not make a scene. I was not happy at all.  In fact, I probably not go back again.",

She saw us coming in so she opened the door for us, she then walked over to the podium, grabbed menus and silverware, escorted us to our table, all without washing her hands after changing the trash can.  After we were seated we were not greeted or acknowledged by our waitress.  One dude was too busy dancing around , one waitress was sitting at a booth too consumed with her cellphone noticing nothing around her.  Several people were just walking not concerned about my table. After sitting there for almost 10 minutes we walked out.  I will never visit this particular location again.  Terrible service, unsanitary and terrible customer service at this location.",

I'm a sucker for Schnitzel with Spatzle, and it was on the menu so I ordered it. It was horrible. It was covered in capers and drowning in lemon juice. So much juice I could have poured it into my water, added a pack of sugar and had lemonade. There were more capers than Spatzle itself.  I will not be back. Sad, because the Czech Pilsner was pretty good. It's kind of like meatloaf. If you have it on the menu, it better be good. This was not, and was not even authentic in any way.",

Someone tried to lead us to a small rectangle table in the darkest area of the restaurant....I said no thanks, we'd rather have one of the round tables in the light, bright area.  We were early 11:30 am so the lunch \"crowd\" hadn't arrived yet.  Of course I ordered the wrong item.  I selected what they called the seafood salad plate.  It consisted of a HUGE amount of lettuce, a few tiny canned shrimp and perhaps two tablespoons of crab salad....some chopped up cucs and a sliced egg...small chopped up tomatoes.  All this for $14.99. Never again!",

They have really good Happy Hour specials, which we took advantage of since we got to Westgate early. Beats getting stuck in Rush Hour traffic and also having to pay the outrageous prices to park for the hockey game!   I had the Blue Cheese Chips, which were kettle chips doused with melted cheese, blue cheese dressing, bacon bits, and green onion pieces, and they were so good! To drink I had a Diet Coke, which they gave me free refills of. My friend got an order of Sliders and some Garlic fries, which Gordon Biersch is known famously for...and the fries were delicious and not overly caked with garlic like they are at Chase Field. Until last night, Chase Field and Salt River Fields were the only places i'd ever had GB's Garlic Fries...so add #3 to this list.   Small, easy to eat items and I got full on the Chips and Garlic Fries. My friend was still hungry since his Sliders only came with 2 and then we split the fries, so he ordered the 8-inch Veggie Pizza. GB's version of the Personal Pan Pizza. it was cut into 6 slices and looked really good! He also had a Fat Tire beer to drink.   We were there for about an hour and a half, since we had time to spare before the gates opened for the game. We left around 5:30 and walked over to Jobing, walking by the shops and restaurants. Last night was a great night to be out and about. Westgate was hopping and not just because of the hockey game either. The movie theater was jam packed, as were a few restaurants and some stores. Some people I noticed were doing holiday shopping as well.   I enjoyed the whole experience of Gordon Biersch. The bar staff was awesome and very cool. Our meals were pretty good, and the whole atmosphere was full of Colorado Avalanche and Phoenix Coyotes fans.   I recommend giving Gordon Biersch a try if you haven't already.",

That was the one and only thing I truly didn't enjoy about the items I consumed during my visit to the 'Biersch.  The shrimp and lobster tacos were the closest to seafood heaven I've come to this far inland and in a chain joint. Fresh lobster and shrimp tossed around in some amazing cream sauce and then put between a hard shell, it was REALLY REALLY good. The rice and beans my meal came with were pretty bland, but I don't care. My fanaticism about my tacos probably comes from the price to quality ratio; you see, I'd have paid much more for these tacos in a nicer restaurant and they still probably wouldn't have been as good. The garlic fries we shared as an appetizer were good, but some of them were overcooked and others were soggy.  Our server was trying a little to hard, to the point that he was becoming more of an annoyance then a real help. We'll forgive him, he still did a decent job.",

And no, I was not one of the 40-something gals that looked like my dress was manufactured in a scissor factory hobbling around in 6-inch stilettos hoping to attract the attention of the god of 80's rockers.  But I highly recommend attending such a concert, if for nothing else, the people watching.  And not just for the women.  I thoroughly enjoyed the guy in front of me and his air drumming skills.  Anywho, back to Biersch's.  It was packed, but we did find a seat on the patio.  I liked that the bar was open to both the restaurant and the patio, so that you could sit at the bar but still be outside.  I was concerned about being late, but my husband, who is apparently way cooler than me, schooled me in that it's perfectly acceptable to arrive late.  Uh, when it's over $300 for 2 tickets, I want to see EVERYTHING.  In spite of the crowds, our server Michael, was on top of it, as was the bar.  Drinks came really quickly.  The kitchen was a little slower, as was expected, but still reasonable.  We ordered the Brewer's Feast ($17) which included Kobe sliders, garlic fries, southwest egg rolls, and hummus.  The sliders and fries were 4.5-star good IMO, egg rolls 4 stars, and hummus 2.5 stars since the crostini was not very good.  We also ordered one each of the mini dessert tasters...strawberry cheesecake, chocolate cake, brownie mousse, and apple bread pudding.  None were outstanding.  I think the mousse was my favorite.  Not sure a full meal would garner my 4-star rating, but for drinks and appetizers, I'm a fan.  And we were on time!  BTW, when did a t-shirt become 50 bucks?  I'm pretty sure they were not that much in 1986!",

We split a chicken cashew salad which was ok, kobe sliders which were good and homemade potato chips with blue cheese, scallions and bacon which were well...finger licking good!  Great prices for the food and beverages.   Great staff.",

    "text": "We decided to try this restaurant for the first time a litte over a month ago. The waitress was very polite and the food was ok, I think it was a bit over-priced for simple dishes. When we were finished, the waitress offered to take our food that was left over to box it up in the kitchen. The next day when I warmed my food up in the kitchen at work, I noticed a piece of glass in the food. Not knowing if there was any more that I was not able to see, I threw the food away and contacted the restaurant to speak to the manager to make him aware. He asked the basic questions like when we came in and who waited on us and what we had to eat so that he could look up the receipt. When he came back on the phone after looking at the receipt, he mentioned that the dining room should have been closed at that time, not sure what that had to do with my complaint. Maybe to kindly tell me that if we had not come at that time to eat, we would not have had the problem?? I don't know. He proceeds to ask what I wanted him to do about it...I would think that he would have had some sort of courtesy in mind already considering he already had me on the phone for almost 10 minutes to do his own research. I asked if he could at least comp the plate that had to be disgarded and he says that he couldn't do that because we had already left the restaurant and it was the next day. He instead offers a $10 gift card for our next visit (I think that only pretty much covered what we left for a tip for the waitress). I was not going to argue with the guy so I just said yeah that's fine. He asked if I wanted to stop by and pick it up or if he should just mail it my house. I asked him to just go ahead and mail it so that I wouldn't have to make the trip down there since it is out of my route from work. Well, this was almost 5 weeks ago and needless to say, he never sent the gift card. I'm more disappointed in the lack of care that he showed for something that could've been hazardous had I not spotted the glass in my food. I will not go back to this restaurant and waste my money there when there are plenty more restaurants that are next to this one that have much better food at more reasonable prices.",

    "text": "Looks like  solid twos are the thing here.   Was seated quickly,  order taken quickly and  first round of drinks all appeared. Going quite well.  The garlic fries  came out shortly after and  that's when it started to go from  4 stars  downwards.    Cajun Pasta :  Nothing original or subtle,    I should known better.   Monotonous taste with all the right shapes present but it's a hit of their sauce and that's all you get for the rest of the meal.    NY Steak Sandwich  Massive,  but dry. The sauce was minimal and  the lack of drinks stopped Erin from getting through more than a third of it.  Also had those wonderful garlic fries but they either need to revisit the sauce  and  perhaps trim the gristle off  come to think of it this was a lame $14  sandwich.    Coffee :  Tepid,  like it's being heated by a lamp.  Only had to suffer two of these.   Service: Started out great but  the drinks stayed dry for most of the meal. This was not on game night, rush hour  so it looked like the usual mis match of staff to customers that seems to be Phoenix area speciality in casual dining.     Mediocre   to the point that I can't even  make fun of the place   it's just not worth it.  For non beer drinkers I can't see this being a place to seek out when  their close, but tastier analog that actually has hard cider, Yard House, is within a mile away.",

    "text": "We stopped by here on Sunday late afternoon after a movie at the AMC.  I've driven by here many times and was always curious.  I love a good brewery.  Usually the food is good in breweries as well...but not here.  I should have paid closer attention to the 3 star rating on Yelp!  Yikes...  It was cool and raining outside so we both ordered the Lobster Bisque...it was really nasty.  It was very slimy and mucusy tasting.  We were served bread, it's a kind of flat bread that is usually served with herbs and oil, but this bread was cold and served with cold hard butter.  It wasn't very tasty.  My companion ordered a chicken sandwich with the garlic fries...I ordered the daily special for a hamburger and garlic fries.  Both sandwiches were mediocre at best. Honestly it's a tastier hamburger at Sonic.  I didn't taste the fries because by this time I was just disgusted at the whole meal.  On the plus side, our server was very good as was the beer. Unfortunately for our server she made the mistake of asking if everything was good.  Now I wouldn't have ever said anything if she hadn't asked, I would have just left and never went back. But she asked and I told her how it just wasn't very good.  She did everything she could to make amends, offering us free dessert etc.    We weren't there to take advantage or to try and get a discounted meal, it truly wasn't good and I truly won't go back.",

I was dining alone and waited over 10 minutes to get any service in the bar area.  I was given a glass of water and told someone would be with me.  Another 5+ minutes went by before the waitress came.  I could understand if it was busy but there were 2 waitresses and 5 tables with customers. I ordered a salad and the lettuce was brown and the tomatoes were mushy and rotten.  I would not recommend this GB to anyone unless you love bad service and bad food!",

There was a one hour wait for those who hadn't. However, those who had these special \"Passport\" memberships got bumped to the head of the line. Anyway like all event related establishments it cleared out quickly after the rush had settled.  However, we waited an hour after sitting to get our food, and even then it didn't show up all at once.  The poor waiter kept apologizing to not only us but everyone saying they had been backed up in the Kitchen quite a bit, to which a regular customer doesn't understand if he/she sees not many people around. I ordered the Chicken Marsala, which was good except the pan fried noodles it came with were way too oily! After complaining we got our whole ticket comped except one drink, total bill for 4 people was $6.75! I certainly would not recommend this place to anyone, unless you are going to a game.  The ambience was great, plenty of outdoor seating, the beer fantastic (I had an excellent Maarzen) but the traffic lines, the mad rush of the event crowd and the relatively small kitchen make this place unsuitable for proper entertaining and dining.",

But the great thing is, even though the place is going to be packed, they still have happy hour (and HH prices) right before the game.   For less money than going inside Jobing to eat, I get great beer, great food, with great service in a nice sit down restaurant.  And yes, even thought the place is packed with hockey fans, you still get great service.  The wings, calamari, garlic, tacos, and almost all HH food is great.  Even though it is a chain, it is still one of my all time favorites brewery restaurants.",
