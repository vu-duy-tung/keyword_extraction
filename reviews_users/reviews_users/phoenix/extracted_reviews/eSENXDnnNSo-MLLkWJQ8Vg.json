    "text": "Sometimes you buy a groupon and then you accidentally don't use it your first try.  So you come back.  That happens.  It happened.  With my two visits to La Santisima, I'd say they know what they're doing.  The offer some dishes that were new to me.  Lonches, for one.  I know what lonche is in Spanglish practice, but what_a_ lonche is, was news to me.  And it was good news.  All around, the food was good.  Salsas are even better.  I did order horchata my first time...but I've totally forgotten what that was like.  That seems to have happened to much of what happened during my first year on the job.  This isn't the only thing I've forgotten.  I've blocked out a lot, apparently.  The service was fine.  I've never seen the place hoping, but maybe the weekend dinner crowd is bashful or something.  Our water cups stayed pretty full and our server was otherwise attentive.  The wait for food was never long.  Cost was fine. It is a gourmet taco shop, after all, so you get what you pay for.  Portions are not huge and style comes with a cost.  The decor is lovely.  I could steal some of their paintings for home, I like them so much.  That is, if they weren't so darn big.  I'd likely give it another visit, that is if we're in Glendale downtown, just walking around, or something.  It seems to be one of the best options.",

    "text": "This place has classic tacos from Mexico D.F. and a really great salsa bar. The peanut salsa is unexpectedly spicy, and the cilantro salsa is a personal favorite of mine.   I'm a fairly unadventurous eater. Once I find my favorite, I like to stick to it, but that's pretty much impossible here. I want to try everything, and think that over time, I'll eventually get there. Until then, my top recommendations are the street plate with at least 1 mole taco. You'll be upcharged, but if that's your only reason for not trying this piece of delicious, message me for a stronger sales pitch. The point of this place is that if you know what you like, or even if you don't, you'll find something here. Everything tastes like a really good version of what you'd expect at a price point that can't be beat.  Pro tip: toss some cilantro salsa in with your rice :)",

Very impressive menu but I just stuck with the 3 Taco mix & match plate for my first visit. I will have to say the flavor in these tacos were the best I've ever had. I have been craving them ever since I've tried them. The salsa bar is beyond flavorful. Probably the widest variety I have seen. The artwork and atmosphere is very welcoming. This is definitely a MUST TRY place. Lunch rush can be busy, but that's a good sign!!!",

Server changed twice and more than 10 servers were standing around while cups and chips were empty.  The bar tender stood in the bar and was eating while behind the bar.

Oddly our table was falling apart, literally the pieces of siding was broke and hanging on, was just hoping it would not pinch our arms. I was ok with the broken furniture; but was very disappointed in the temperature was the adult beverages.  Initially ordered a glass of the house white wine and it was served warm, decided to grab a beer in hopes the beverage temp would be different sadly it was not. The beer was a hair colder then the warm wine, beverage refrigerator may need to be checked. Will try again if see coupon.",

It was very uncomfortable as it felt like we were a bother. If you're looking for a great experience this place is not it. Not anymore. It seemed the table next to us was also upset and placed a complaint but she disregarded it and even joked about it the her next table.

My beer dos xx it was warm and bitter. We were given chips so we went to the salsa bar only to be disappointed with the salsas taste some where even a little spoiled. Are food arrived it looked really good on our plates my wife got the chicken mole tacos  meal. The tacos were really good! The beans were also starting to spoil and the rice was less then average. For my order I got the \"santo Plato\" pastor burrito and a pastor taco. With calabas on the side the calabas was the only thing good on my plate! My pastor burrito meat was burnt and I know they do it intentionally to give it a little flavor but they over did it. It tasted like I was eating coal. As for the service it was good they came to you with a smile. As of now I will maybe try there other location in the hopes that it will be better.",

Which is another mexican food place but has been around for quite awhile. So here you go.... If you are looking for a mexican dish enchilada style that can be eaten with a soup spoon?? Go to La Perila, which is good don't get me wrong. But if your looking for a flavor party of some really good authentic mexican food go to La Santisma. There is a good chance you too will be excited to share this place with others. Don't want to forget the staff was very friendly and helpful. The layout of this place is cool and family like. Nice front patio that would be pretty cool come sundown. Welp Enjoy I sure did and will again.",

The 2 waitresses have a very poor attitude... Last week we went the girl waitress had an attitude and told my sister in law they were out of rice & michelada's!  Went back today and the waitresses would not even wait on us! Another couple sat next to us and they give them menus & chips!!! We waited 20 minutes before walking out! Mind you have been loyal customers since they opened their doors! The food was great but has gone down hill!",

I was a loyal customer coming in once a week at least. The previous staff this restaurant had were amazing. You can tell they really enjoyed their job. They made me feel like I was at home. I was always taken care of by one particular server every Thursday night. Stacey, she was an outstanding employee and I enjoyed her attentiveness with us. Stacey was a hard worker and she put dedication to her job role. I decided to continue to go after she resigned but it just wasn't the same anymore. The new servers aren't polite with you. They don't listen to your concerns. They simply take your order bring your food and never check on you again. They don't ask if you need a refill or another basket of chips (most simple things a server can do). They are simply rude. It seems as if they simply want your money and want you out of there quick. Even though their food is delicious, if you don't have good service then it makes your experience horrible all around. For this reason I will not be returning but I hope this gives them a heads up to make changes and improve their service.",

We waited about 5 minutes before I had to walk over to the bartender and ask if it was self seating. I was told that they have to clear the tables which were full and that's why we weren't sitting yet. Thanks... I guess? So we finally sit and its 15 minutes before were asked what we want to drink and are given menus. About 10 minutes later the bar tender walks up and says \"I'm not your waiter but I'll help you\" the girl that was supposed to be our waiter was in her own world staring at the POS system like she was having problems creating people checks, but I think she just didn't want to face all the mad diners looking impatient around me. People that walked in 15-20 minutes after me are already getting Togo boxes and pretty much the same issue was present with the table next to us. We came in five minutes after him yet finished eating before he received his food. There was no order or massive issues in the kitchen or both. Even a walk up Togo order was in and out quickly, but the man was complaining about receiving the wrong food. The waitress seemed to argue back with customers or give excuses. It was very unacceptable customer service wise. I will never go back or recommend this place even though the food was good. Near the end of the meal we were told the food was great (which it was) but the service was horrible (also True) by a staff member. Why can't you fix it if you know it's wrong? If you order take out I would suggest the street tacos as they are all very good. If the restaurant isn't busy I'm sure the service doesn't struggle (as I've experienced the first time I went in) but when I returned on a date to careless and horrible service I know it's not worth my time to return.",

This taco was one of the worat tacos I have ever tried. The fish was covered in a thick beer batter and was so dark and smelled awful. I should have known better when the server said she'd never tried it because \"she's very picky about her fish\". We also tried their Gaucho quesdadilla based on a suggestion from the server. The quesadilla tasted like a deep fried blob of cheese with some pieces of steak.  The strawberry salsa from the salsa bar was the only thing that made the quesadilla palatable. The salsa bar should be labeled by spiciness. There are tons of options, but most of the salsa is so spicy, that you couldn't taste anything else (I imagine that whoever said the fish taco was a \"top 100 dish\" smothered the fish in a salsa that made tasting the actual fish impossible).  The horchata was very good with fresh fruit and nuts, hence the 2 star rating.",

We tried to be patient and understand that they are short staffed and actually felt sorry for the servers, we even had to go get chips and water on our own because we were not waited at all.  Customers kept coming and we noticed that 2 different tables got their food before us even though we were there wayyyy before them, so  we asked the server what's going on with our food and stated that the kitchen was just grabbing tickets randomly.  One lady was  clearing tables while food was waiting to be served.  We were obviously disappointed!  Not sure what kind of management they have or I wonder if they even have one.  The servers are new ( that's  what we were told) and I am not blaming them for last night's disappointment,  the OWNER hopefully is reading this.  Will not go back ; as note to owner- Hire some help and train your staff .  We left after almost an hour of waiting.  No, we did not get our food after all that wait.",

Our food was fresh, creative, authentic, and oh so delicious.  They have plenty of vegan and vegetarian options that are clearly indicated on the menu.  We all had burros.  I wanted to try every burro on the menu since they all sounded amazing.  The fresh salsa bar, with it's selection of mild to hot salsas, was a added bonus.

    "text": "Omg. Amazing!  The food here is so rich and filling, i couldnt get it into my mouth fast enough.. i seriously was in heaven..   The salsa bar is to die for. All their salsas are amazing. Im a sucker for salsa that has a good garlic taste with a kick. These were perfect for my taste buds. I enjoyed EVERY single one! They are not overly spicey either where you can enjoy your food. Also you get free chips and you bet i got every single salsa to go with my chips and meal!  I ordered the asada street tacos. It came with rice and beans. They were AMAZING. Beans were rich and creamy, rice was salted perfectly. The meat was not fatty at all, which is huge for me because most resturants have such fatty asada.   The place was decent and extremely clean. Artwork was amazing too. There seemed to only be one waitress in the whole resturant which was fine she was nice and attentive. The place is decently priced and well worth the food if you enjoy mexican. Honestly i wasnt even done with my meal and i was already plotting when to come back and tell everyone how good it was.",

    "text": "This bartender from Souhern Rail recommended La Santisima.  I read some of the reviews and went in a bit knowledgeable.  First let me say, the service is very very very slow.  But the reviews mentioned that.  About 10 minutes of sitting before anyone came to the table.  There were only two other tables.  Ordered drinks and they arrived ten minutes later.  Ordered our food when the waiter came back another 10-15 minutes later, and more chips.  Our food arrived another 15-20 minutes later.  They brought our trio taco plate and a couple of other tacos.  The food was delicious!   We enjoyed our meals and about 20 minutes later when the waiter came back we placed an order for take out for someone at home.  Another 15-20 minutes it came with the bill.  The waiter brought out a tablet. Which he used for ordering, and just had the screen to the \"fixed \" tip amount.  I had to ask him to show me the bill.  All good I guess.  Soooooooo, don't go in like you're starving. Know it will be like one of those looooong five course meals and enjoy.  I will go back again knowing how the service is and more likely be more precise in tipping since the service isn't reflected in the \"fixed tip\" amount.  Next time I'll customize it.",

    "text": "Wow!! The place does not lie! The name says it all - gourmet tacos!!   Upon arrival, I noticed the authentic touch with the outside doors - 3 to be exact. Check out the pics! Then coming inside, I see vibrant colors with matching works of art affixed on the walls. A patio is also available if you're looking to soak in some sunshine.   Once seated, we got a basket of warm chips. They have an amazing salsa bar with a variety of flavors to try. Some of the ones we tried were the: pecan, cilantro, La Santisima salsa, chipotle, radish of some sort, guacamole, and more. So fun to try different spicy kick flavors!  Today I tried the Aztec Tinga taco (a Mexico City specialty), which is shredded chicken with tomato, onion, and Aztec chipotle salsa. It's got a little spice, but balances out with the double corn tortilla. This taco was meaty and juicy!   The other one I tried was the Mayan Cochinita Pibil taco - a Yucatan speciality! This was a True fork tender pork shoulder with achiote rojo topped with lime marinated onions and salsa Habanera Maya.  Lots of meat!! Love!   I also had the chance to try the La Santisima special taco with chicken and cheese and a steak filled taco. Both were amazing as well. Each of these were ordered a la carte ($4-$5 each). If you order 2 of the same, you get it with a side of rice and beans. The beans have a bit of spice and the rice included kernels of corn. Yummy!   Finally, I ordered their version of a horchata. It is unlike any other horchata I've tried! It's my first one that included fruits and pecans! Quite unique and refreshing!   I'm looking forward to trying the other gourmet tacos and hopefully will make room for the flan!!",

My party was going to give her more than the gratuity rate, but because of that, we decided not to give her anything. I shouldn't be asked to give them tips.

I give respect to the guy that works there solo, but he's so busy hustling and bustling that it's hard for him to give adequately good service when he's rushing through our orders. We have been there 3 times and each time it is the same, 4 or 5 tables and we end up waiting 20 minutes to get a drink order.  I love the atmosphere and food too much to stop going, just hope they hire another waiter in the near future!!  Definitely recommend this place to others!!!",

I really like the jicama, cilantro, peanut and of course traditional ones.  The menu is a little confusing but once you kind of figure it out, you're good.  I was suggested to try the grapefruit margarita by my friend and it as so refreshing.  Usually most places margarita's are loaded with that awful sour mix but this did not give me any weird after taste or belly aches :)  So of course had to get it again at this location and just the same, good!  Then last time I had tried two different tacos.  One was pork the other beef and the beef was incredible.  I then tried the beef yesterday in their quesa version and oh my.  Such a neat presentation and so good.  Loved the fresh sliced avocado on the top.  Even took half home for leftovers.  Can't wait to go back and try other items too.  I have heard about the horchata's but have not had enough room at the end of my meal to try them but maybe next time.",

The decor and styling of the restaurant is great. I loved the paintings and lighting throughout. There is ample seating although we came on a very busy night.   Now for the bad news. We waited nearly an hour for a total of 8 tacos between 4 people. We were told by the manager that he was sorry and he was missing two servers and a cook. Sadly I did see people leave prior to getting food due to service. I can only hope this gets addressed.   On the good side the tacos were excellent. I ordered two steak tacos, while my friend ordered one steak and one shredded pork. He also described the steak taco as good but he said the pork was delicious.   Great menu with lots of choices.

I would have given it 5 stars but it was warm in there. In AZ you do not want to go from baking outside to eating in a warm restaurant. There was also only one server working.",

We had to grab her on her way back to ask to be seated as she didn't seem to want to even acknowledge our presence. The place was maybe 60% full, so it wasn't busy by any means. After a while, she came back and said it'd be at least 5 min before they could seat us as they had to bus a table. While waiting, another couple came in behind us, was helped immediately and was told the same table would be available soon for them. The waiters were chatting away and a couple of them were even flipping through their phones. For being behind, there was no sense of urgency from any of the staff to catch up. We left as there were way too many warning signs that it'd be very poor service for our meal. I shouldn't have ignored the other reviews that said the service was going downhill--don't make the same mistake.",

The margaritas are definitely spot on too, definitely a must try if you are in the area!",

Either way my biggest complaint is customer service. We waited a good 15-20min and no one ever came to give us menus let alone take any drink order. We ended up leaving and I'm pretty sure no one even noticed. It's disappointing as I was really excited to see a location open closer to my house. The service is great at the 16st location but normally has a wait for seating as it is a smaller location. Needless to say, I won't be returning to the Glendale location.  I'd rather wait for a table and have better service and food.",

First off i ordered a horchata, which was the second best i have ever had, they put a good variety of fruits in there that perfectly complemented the flavor..   I then ordered some street tacos, and before they came out i walked up to the Salsa Bar.. oh man, i need more than just a spoon for this place, they have every flavor you would expect, and an delicious peanut salsa.. it was soo tasty i don't even know if the tacos themselves were any good, guess i gotta go back!",

I also like that when I get my plate the food is piping hot and you can tell the ingredients are fresh. I find their prices to be very reasonable and their staff was kind and attentive.

They have this thing they call a quesa, which is raw corn tortilla dough that they roll out and stuff with the meat of your choice (we tried the Sonora Arrachera Quesa), close it up and deep fry it. OMG, what a flavor explosion! We also had the Carne Asada and Aztec Tinga tacos. Both were delicious, but fair warning, the Tinga is a tad messy to eat, so don't wear white. Their list of taco and burrito options is lengthy, (including meatless) and there has to be something for everyone. I was a little dissapointed in their salsa bar. It has tons of tasty choices, but really, most of them are what I think of as sauces (no texture) and not salsas. Great for the tacos, not so much for the chips. Besides the chips, there is nothing with any crunch (i.e. flauta, crispy taco, chimichanga) on the menu, which is odd since they do fry the Quesas (they have a light crispiness, but the thickness of the dough prevents them from being crunchy). For those two reasons, I am giving four stars rather than five, but don't let that fool you. The food is top notch!",

They serve beer and margaritas so they are perfect as a late afternoon destination.  The salsa bar is well equipped with different tastes from all over Mexico, and the owner Felipe is a food guy at heart.  He made it a point to come over and say hi and introduce himself.  We ended the meal with a Horchata to go, and I have to say I couldn't have left any happier!",

The other ordered a lunch plate. Two margaritas & one beer. The total was over $80!! For lunch!! The margaritas were not as good as previously. It's such a shame.

Any reviews in attempt to describe La Santisima, or otherwise are as follows: Effutiation.   It means \"Useless words\", before you ask.   And what I say, what We say about La Santisima, is futile.   Do you know they've been in the news? They've been on national TV.   They've been hit on by the platinum porcupine himself, Guy Fieri, or whatever his name is. He, like Pamela Anderson, is only famous for His Triple D's.  So...  There is nothing we can.   They're like a living mythological land you can visit.   Ive eaten at both locations, hell I've eaten here before they were \"La Santisima\" and were named something else. Didn't know that shit, did you?   Yeah, huh, Little trivia for ya.   Ive opened both locations  & and I've closed both locations. I've had every Salsa the bar can offer and I've had 16 menu items -- multiple times -- and fuck what I'm saying and just fucking go here!   . . .   Why are you still reading?   Go!   Ok, still don't get it?   So i'm giving you another word ( It's real before you ask ).   I'll just call La Santisima eellogofusciouhipoppokunurious.   ( You can look it up. I'll wait. )",

Do yourself a favor and try the queso fundido appetizer (I added in shrimp), the bean dip (I mean whaaat, since when are refried beans good?!), literally any quesa, the shrimp taco, lots of rice (I literally never eat the rice at most restaurants) and, last but not least, the horchata!",

My reaction 0_O really grade 1 star. We finish our chips server just looks at us doesn't bring us chips I get up give him the basket to see if he can bring us more he says yes grade 1 star. He comes back I want to order some tacos he says no you should eat the quesadilla my reaction o_0 grade 1 star.  We ask for napkins he responds \"oh they are in the hallway next to the restroom my reaction \"wtf\" I get up and grab them myself. Grade 1/2 star  The deep fried quesadilla was so chewy I couldn't cut it \"this is what they are known for\" yeah.! They need another cook.! Grade 1star  The meat was delicious.!!! 5 stars  The salsas 5 stars  The tacos were too big my advice keep them small and don't do double tortilla we get it you guys want us to leave satisfied but are doing a mistake serving your tacos with two huge tortillas.! We will not be going there anymore want so good tacos 7 ave and camelback next yo Charlie's \"tacos Yakis\" delicious tacos and not as pricy!

I ordered two of their carne asada tacos with pickled onions and chimichurri sauce which came with rice and beans with fresh cheese on top, it was fantastic. My boyfriend got the bullet burro which he absolutely loved. We'll definitely be coming back to try more of their salsas!",

    "text": "Luckily we learned about the small taco shop on Groupon. We drove past the Glendale location and we thought it was closed. Had to call to double check the hours. Once we walked in, we were greeted by the manager or owner, very welcoming. He offered us some chips and guacamole. Came to find out there was no refill on chips and we had to pay for the guacamole...  I would have liked to enjoyed some chips throughout my meal, not just the first 10 minutes. Me and my boyfriend don't drink soda, so he offered a drink we took water. He brought us the water, but in a PLASTIC CLEAR CUP. Like the ones Circle K gives you. However the tacos we ordered were AMAZING. I had the Carne Asada street tacos. They were delicious. We ate and talked. about 20 minutes later, still no waiter for a refill. I had to get up and walk to the bar for more water. Finally the check comes... we paid in cash and we had decided what the tip was going to be. The change came and the waiter/manager/owner took some of the change as his tip...   So if you can get past the bad service, getting offered something that should be free, small plastic water cups, then you'll have a great meal. We're going to go again, but to the other location.",

The queso cheese dip is NOT dip, rather just semi-melted shredded cheese burnt onto a plate (for $8). It literally took 15 min for us to get a Dixie size cups of water. Our server 'Ambar' didn't know anything about the restaurant nor how to serve. I asked about margarita specials and she literally said \"idk, Thursday's we have specials but idk about today.\" After finally bringing us our food and water, I asked for silverware and she told me \"they're inside by the salsa bar.\" I've never been to a restaurant where you have to go get your own silverware. The food was under seasoned and chewy. Finally I asked for the manager and Ambar said \"she doesn't speak english.\" I am a server too and I realize every place has bad days, but this experience was unacceptable and I will never be back.",

I tried the la santisma taco with arrachera carne and the shark taco. Both were incredible. Really like the shark taco with its sauce.  And the santisma taco was right on. Real Mexican sodas with real sugar straight from the glass bottle. And don't forget the salsa bar. Seriously, so many salsas to choose from. Try them all, I did and simply went back for those I liked, no loved!  Oh. Did I forget even the rice and beans were good and I only know this because they mistakenly added them to my plate, the chef was being generous the waiter said. Thank you I said!  These are definitely better the average rice and beans.",

After visiting a few more times i realized the cool factor and individuality here just doesn't really match up to the much more traditional tacos you find at other spots.  The tacos are not bad, but overthought, and the flavors in many of the \"gourmet\" tacos just don't really do it for me.  Too much going on at once.  Another thing that causes my 3 star review is the salsa bar.  At first glance it looks very promising with lots of options and colors.  Once again the taste of the numerous salsas is lacking something.  Its like 10 salsas that are just OK when you could have knocked a simple red and green sauce out of the park instead.  They're drinks are good and i really like the vibe inside, but i don't think it lives up to the hype that the many reviews will lead you to believe.",

The rice and beans side was also delectable. My husband ordered green chile burro and he also said it was very good.

    "text": "My salsa prayers have been answered!! They have a ton of options for flavoring your chips, taco, or whatever delicious food you may be eating here. I tried their peanut salsa, jalapeno, chipotle, and all the others I could get my hands on. They each had their own distinct flavor and they are all uniquely amazing. I was so pleased to find a True delicious salsa bar on this side of town.  I grew up with salsas from my mom and she makes some DELICIOUS salsas. These were all so good and up to par with my mamas.   When we first got here, it was dead. But within 20 min, there was a big wait. We were lucky to have gotten there when we did. We were graciously greeted and served fresh hot chips! I ordered a coronarita and it was ok. Not the best but decent. A little too high priced for me at ten bucks. I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said the quesadillas since they are deep fried. I ordered the vegetarian one. Oh my goodness. That was the most delicious quesadilla I have ever had in my life. I probably wouldn't call them quesadillas. They were more like gorditas. But either way, AMAZING.   I look forward to coming back and tasting their tacos, tortas and burritos. And stuffing my face with more chips and twenty different Salsas. :-) can't wait!",

    "text": "La Santisima, known in a past life as La Condesa, makes some of the best...THE BEST burritos and salsas in the valley. It looks like fast casual food, but it's a sit down restaurant that costs less than competitors while offering way higher quality eats.   Like the 15+ varieties of salsa, ranging from a spicy, smoky chipotle to a light, creamy cilantro. Your food is going to take forever, so you might as well enjoy as many as you can. They all come across as very fresh--none of that canned crap.   My burrito, the Gaucho, was up there with the best I've had. And I've had a LOT of burros. The grilled white cheese, rich steak that had a faint wine flavor, cucumbers, and some peppers. Amazing. Great! The portion was huge as well, and I could barely finish it. I have a HUGE appetite.   The coolest part was that it was only around $9. That's somewhere between fast-casual and sit-down prices, but with better quality than virtually any Mexican restaurant. For about another $4 you can add some awesome aguas frescas like the horchata, complete with a touch of strawberry. I actually don't like that type of fruit infusion in something I expect to be straight up rice and cinnamon, but I can appreciate the quality ingredients.   I'm sold on this place, and I definitely recommend you should go, but that doesn't mean I'm going to overlook a few flaws that irk me. The first is that I'm not sure the furniture is either comfortable, tasteful, or clean. The high wooden tables are much obliged for taller patrons like myself, but they were sticky...despite being actively cleaned as we walked in. Gross. The seats are shoddy as well. The airbrush-on-canvas Frida Kahlo paired with the \"no no THIS IS HOW MEXICAN FOOD IS DONE WE USE PROPER NAMES\" motif on the menu give this a unique, yet eyeroll-worthy vibe I can best describe as try-hard and totally hipster.   Service is questionable as well. Although I appreciate that everyone who is not American actually takes their time at restaurants, I don't find anything particularly complex that warrants 20+ minutes for a burrito, and tacos/beans/rice for my dining partner. This is on top of the 10+ minutes it took to get a menu. We actually had to get up and grab them ourselves! They were not really paying attention.   Oh yeah, and then there's the warm tap water. Gross.   Anyway, Santisima comes across as a place with great cooks that don't know how to run a restaurant. I can't say I enjoyed any aspect of dining in besides salsa sampling, and so I've gotta deduct points even though that was a 5-star burrito. Fortunately, you can avoid these issues by just ordering something to go, which is probably what I'll gladly do when I undoubtedly return.",

The server was actually nice and was doing her best, but she had no help and was running the entire restaurant by herself. Seating, serving, busing all done by one overworked server. We waited 45 minutes just to get our drinks. About an hour to get out food.  Third, food is not bad, but not worth the wait.  The horchata and the salsa bar are the only saving graces to this place, but honestly it should be shut down.",

    "text": "La Santisima is a Mexican Restaurant with a unique menu that features many tacos some interesting and hard to find Mexican Foods like the Stuffed Chili with Walnut Sauce and the Mexican version of stuffed calzones called Quesa. Another one of the other unique features is  a very large salsa bar that has about 15-20 different salsas to try. The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating and it's done in a really cool Day of the Dead kind of theme. This location is in Old Town Glendale and they have their own parking lot.  I've been here a couple times since my first visit and a few things I loved before have been slightly different so I have to get that out there.  The Marlin Taco I had on my first visit tasted very similar to the Marlin Tacos I had in Mexico. They have a unique smoked flavor and were delicious with a similar flavor. On my most recent visit the Marlin Taco was still good but lacked the smoked taste and had little flavors on it's own. It was still good and packed with a very generous amount of filling but not the same.  I also tried the Whitefish taco. It was also packed with a generous amount of crispy battered fish and lots of cabbage dressed with a very mild cilantro dressing. It was good but also needed to be kicked up with things from the salsa bar. I added a squirt of lime juice, a little cilantro salsa and some strawberry salsa and then it was really tasty.  For me and the majority of people out there two tacos is all you can eat because they are double shelled and fully packed.  My husband had a three taco platter that comes with rice and refried beans. He got a pork taco, chicken tinga and a brisket taco that was grilled. The most perfect and favorite taco was the Chicken Tinga. It was very flavorful and made with moist dark chicken meat. The brisket had good flavors but it was stringy.  We were both really full so we took out a vegetable quesa (like a calzone but the dough is made with masa and it might be fried) to have latter because the quesa is usually really delicious and is a treat here. I don't remember what vegetables came in it on past visits but this time it was mostly just onions. I did find traces of spinach and mushrooms but it was filled with mostly onions and cheese and was still a tasty treat but it wasn't the same.  I still really like this place and service was ok too but some things aren't up there where they were before so I had to get it out there.  3 stars according to Yelp means A-OK",

I got a torta/lonche and street tacos and everything was okay.   The customer service was what brings this from what could have been a 4 star review to a 2 star. We were not attended properly. We had asked for 2 items on the side and never got them... told the waiter and he only brought back 1 thing. I had to go up to the counter to ask for the last item. We never once got a drink refill or got checked up on until the check came. It wasn't busy that day and the waiters were just standing around so being occupied wasn't an excuse. It took so long to receive food and the check. Another couple there got there after us and also left after us, which meant that fast service could have been done. Once time came around to pay, I had asked the server if he could split the check and he stated it was too much work and that he had already input it into the system, which made it so difficult. I ended up paying $40 for a 2 entree lunch, which was extremely overpriced and not worth it.",

The chairs are comfy and they have a wall with bench seating which is very cool a gets a thumbs up from me. They have beautiful paintings on the walls. They have a small bar with a good selection of hard alcohol, wine and beer. They also have a outside patio which is pretty large.   The food was pretty good. We ordered our tacos a la carte because we wanted to try different ones. The street tacos have a good amount of meat in them. Not skimpy like most places. And we also ordered one of the signature tacos and they are big. No wonder why they are $4+ a taco lol.   Over all this place is a nice place to hang out at. I can see them having a great taco Tuesday. My reasoning for only giving them 4 stars is because I can't give half of a star. The reason for hall a star off Is because they serve can drinks instead of fountain. I hate when a restaurant gives you can sodas.",

We got out our phones and decided to check Yelp reviews for a good Mexican restaurant. La Santisima Gourmet Tacos popped up:)  We were welcomed immediately when we entered and received outstanding service. The restaurant has a cool vibe with colorfully striped chairs and large, vibrant paintings of Frida, Diego, images of Dia de Los Muertos and other iconic images.   A lot of Mexican restaurants have salsa bars, but not with this many freshly made salsas and in such flavorful varieties. We had to stop ourselves from eating chips so we would have room for our lunch! I tried the combination plate of three street tacos with rice and beans. All were fantastic, but the spicy pork was my favorite! My husband had a quesadilla that he raved about. And he grew up in AZ, so he is picky about Mexican food! We'll definitely return...with friends:)",

I'm still craving it -- it's that good!    I'm a Southern California native and am blessed with great Mexican food, but La Santisima is a different category.  They serve Tex-Mex and their quesas (their version of a quesadilla) -- straight foodgasm in my mouth.  I just wish we had more time in Az this time around to go back and try their fish tacos.  (Yes, it was that good that I would've gone back consecutive days!)  So many salas to choose from, all were spicy but delicious and peanut was my favorite.  Thanks for upping the bar and you've made the quesa my last wish meal.  Can't wait to be back --- or open up in Cali, haha.",

    "text": "I've driven by La Santisima many times but never stopped in. The decor on the outside intrigued me so I Yelped it and was impressed by the reviews. We decided to give it a shot on my moms birthday with a party of 5. We were seated quickly got our chips and drinks and started trying the various salsas from the salsa bar. It was pretty cool having more than a few choices and some were really good.  There is almost to much on the menu. All 5 of us had a hard time deciding on what to sample. I decided to go with the shark quesa. It did not disappoint. It was great. All 5 of us enjoyed our food immensely and were talking about when we could get together to go back.   The service was good. Not great but the one waitress was pretty taxed because of how busy they were. We ordered my daughters quesa with no sour cream and it came out with sour cream. It was noticed by the waitress as soon as she put put it down though and she took care of it. My wife's tacos and my daughters quesa were brought out quite a bit later than the other 3 meals. No clue why the tacos took so long but it is what it is. Also it took a bit of effort to get the chips refilled and I still haven't got my drink refilled.   Notice I've mentioned that we had a party of 5 quite a few times... La Santisima automatically adds 18% gratuity to parties 6 or above. Well when we got our bill it was marked as a party of 6, with gratuity added. The waitress took my card, ran it, and low and behold the itemized copy that showed the added gratuity was gone when she brought the customer/store copies back. You know, that's the part when you fill in the tip. If I wouldn't have noticed beforehand I would not have had any idea that the tip was already included. Because we didn't have a party of 6, only 5. I kind of felt like someone was trying to get over on me and get double tipped. Just a suspicion. I don't tend to be the conspiracy theory type but it just seemed a bit fishy to me.   I would definitely go back. The food was fantastic, 5 star territory, but the service snafus and the gratuity mystery cost them a couple stars. When I do go back, and I will, I'm just going to keep a really close eye on my receipt.",

    "text": "Finally visited La Santisima.  Thought I would really really like the food, but I didn't.  Although I did finish my plate, it wasn't spectacular in any way.  Before I get to what I ordered, let me make note on how important it is for a restaurant to have an eye soothing menu.  The online menu is great, but the restaurant menu is much more extensive than the short list on the website.    Unfortunately for me, the menu was much too busy.  The colors were awful and I didn't want to look at it for more than two minutes.   Red and black text looked crammed and didn't stand out the way text on a decently designed menu does.  I barely read past the tacos.    Ordered three tacos a la carte ($3.99 each). The mesquite cactus taco (I can't remember the dish name) with no queso, La Condesa Veggie with no queso, and the fish taco.  Also a side of guac which cost about $4.  Honestly the guac was the most exciting thing on the table. The food was filling but all three tacos needed some DIY spicing.  Ranking: 1. guacamole - made with dried cranberries and mango.  A bit tangier than I prefer, but palatable. 2. spinach taco - wished the spinach was chopped smaller 3. cactus taco - slabs of cactus made my mouth work overtime  4. fish taco - too much breading on the fish, and just plain cabbage with bland white sauce drizzled on top.  Wish I had asked for no white sauce.   The salsa bar is okay.  There were only a few salsas that I thought looked appetizing.  Most were watery and needed some DIY mixing of two or three to get a fantastic flavor.  And with the serving cups being so small, I couldn't grab a decent serving of a favorite salsa.  I refilled at the bar three times and then just gave up.  Our server was kindhearted and brought a sample of horchata.  I have tasted something similar to it, but didn't like it.  Sweet drinks with cinnamon flavor aren't my thing.  If I'm in the area and feeling hungry I would go back.  It's a decent restaurant, but not one to where I would plan a night out.",

We visited on a quiet night and had attentive service, since we were the only other guests other than a large family gathering in the center. The number of patrons, however, is no reflection on the food or experience.   We split two, two-taco plates for maximum sampling--chicken black mole, la santisma with shrimp, chicken tinga, and pork pibil...all of which were delicious. The la santisma, loaded with veggies and cheese was the overall winner (and was the one recommended by our waiter). Also, being a mole fan, I was excited to eat a REALLY good mole!   I only wish there was one closer, because I would eat here wayyyy to often. The salsa bar is out of this world if you are a salsa nut like myself. Sooo many options, all for the tasting. Ever had a delish jicama and cilantro salsa? How about the less common radish salsa, which was outstanding? Not to mention the other 10+ salsas on the bar, including a spicy guac. Many of these have quite the kick, so this may not be for the faint of heart.   Lastly, the house margarita was tasty and we both loved the mixed citrus, including lemons, limes, orange and grapefruit. This is not a \"knock-you-on-your-a$$\" bev, but probably the tastiest mixed drink I've had in a long time. So fresh, crisp and well-made for enjoyment.   I will be making the trip back again and again. Yum...",

It's no frills, no fluff, just great Mexican food for a price you can't match. I'd rather pay 9 bucks for an amazing burrito and eat my salsa out of a plastic bowl than visit a snazzy upscale place with food that's no better but have to shell out twice the price.   Go. To. La.

Biggest offense - serving beef in the veggie tacos and burros - more than once to the same table, and other tables.  The scene: Friday evening ~6:30 pm. There are six 4-tops available, a long both (seating ~15) reserved with no one there yet, all but 1 table unoccupied on the patio, and the long table with 6-8 seats left. In other words, they were not full, no one ever waited for a table to finish before being seated. Despite this, the hostess (and waitress) looked around curiously wondering where to seat us? Anywhere would have worked, and so we were seated. As is custom, we quickly received tortilla chips and were welcomed to the salsa bar.  However, 20 minutes passed before our waitress returned to take our drink order. Based on this, we also placed our entree order. The waitress either has issues with getting the orders correct, or just likes to correct guest annunciations. For instance, the menu says quesa, so we say quesa and she has to repeat oh you mean quesadilla? Not sure why but we rolled with it.   Another 5-10 minutes pass before everyone's drinks arrived (and some of the salsas are very spicy!). We had to ask for waters and were served warm water in clear plastic 12 ou solo cups. The table next to us actually received iced water in real glasses with beautiful blue rims.   We witnessed another table receive their food, only to have half the food removed before two new entrees appeared They were served the wrong items. Huh. Kinda weird. That happened to me last time we were there, but they caught it before I could even take a bite. These people had begun eating and had to point out to the staff that there were issues. Wanna know the issues? BEEF in the VEGAN tacos. How did we find that out you may ask? Guess!  So, after at least 15 minutes (all our drinks are empty and were never asked if we wanted another cerveza or margarita or even sip of water), two of our four dinner entrees were served. Here's where I believe you Yelpers probably have guessed it - one of those was a VEGAN burro - served with BEEF! When we mentioned this to the waitress 7 minutes later refilling the tables drink order next to us. She apologized and mentioned that happened at another table too. She returned with a new (not grilled, kinda gross looking) burro.  Apparently there was a new chef. Yes, let's blame everything on him! More time passes and my entree (taco plate) contained a veggie la santisima taco (missing several listed ingredients such as onions and spinach) but only with cheese, mushrooms, and peppers, and BEEF! Yes there was beef on this too. Not much, but at least one piece is something suppose to be meat free. My shrimp cabo was SPECIFICALLY requested without sauce and it was covered. The waitress actually asked me if I could just pick it off. No, I cannot because the sauce is touching all the cheese and cabbage and I paid for an entire taco. The beans and rice were horrible too, the rice tasted plain, no flavor with bland corn. The beans tasted like watered down gruel - no taste, no seasoning. And last time - I devoured the beans and rice because they were tasty. No amount of salsa bar could fix these tastes today.  So, how about that fourth entree? After the first two people FINISHED their entire meal (one Churro in the Quesa section) then the 4th entree appeared. What about that replaced veggie burro - BEEF in it AGAIN!  You can blame a chef for mixing up orders at a table. But, can you continue blaming the chef when you serve the wrong food to every table? We watched as 2 more tables received incorrect entrees. Oh, and the large party arrived after our troubles began. I can't forgive a wait staff that doesn't know how to handle these situations-wrong food, long wait times, inconsistent timing, beef served to vegetarians. You cannot serve vegetarians meat in the burro - twice. Come on now! Why are all the veggie la satisima missing half the ingredients and containing meat?????   There were some rushed apologies, but no call to action. Asking me if I'd like another taco after we pay is more like salt on the wound than a bandaid. I loved this place our first visit. We couldn't wait to take our parents here. We REGRET deeply what they had to endure and wish to warn others that the salsa bar is NOT worth all the other troubles. We were charged for all the food - even the food that couldn't be eaten (Shrimp cabo, Veggie Burro) and for food that appeared after most people finished their meal at our table of four.   We will NEVER, EVER return to this location and cannot think of how the manager would even attempt to rectify this situation.",

    "text": "We almost did not enter as the place was empty about 7pm, but I had read about the 16 salsa's and we pushed forward just as one other car pulled into the dimly lit parking lot. The Mexican restaurant next door was packed, so we probably should have went over there. This regional brand of Mexican food might appeal to non-gringos as most of the food was quite unusual and hot and some food was just downright bad. The 1/2 order of guac had large chunks of avocado, but also has raisins and a liquidy kind of taste. It was not what you would expect in a normal Mexican joint. The steak tacos I ordered had to be sent back due to excessive fatty pieces and the chicken tinga tacos were way too spicy for a normal palette. The spicy theme continued as nearly all 16 salsa's had a version of heat that ran too hot. This was a sweaty experience, so gringo's stay away. On a positive note, the pregnant waitress was very nice and helpful.",

It is fun to order and share among friends since there is such a variety on the menu - definitely many flavors to suit every palate.  The salsa bar is eclectic and amusing and brings a great point of conversation to the table.  This is a great addition to downtown Glendale.  I was disappointed by the slow service provided at both visits.  The staff plays music from an mp3/iPod but we had to ask several times to turn it down because we could not even here each other talk over the volume of the music.  It was a feature that I could have done without.  These are easy fixes for the management and staff.",

We arrived and it was just being put together so we had margaritas which used to be great... they have since started using brand x margarita mix where they  used to squeeze fresh citrus.  The real problem with this place is the inconsistency I asked for them to make sure the order is proper because I do drive 50 minutes round trip to get get there food which I believe is some of the best in the area. I got home and opened the order and it was incorrect we ordered 8 tacos a quesadilla and. The correct items where the quesadillas 2 tacos and the guacamole. I called immediately upon  opening the wrong food and they asked me to bring it back I let them know that's not a possibility and I informed them what was wrong and asked if they could just credit my Amex. They said no and that there manager would call me to review the issue. Well they haven't so hopefully this review will garner attention so I can speak to them about there awful customer service and inconsistency. After being a valued customer for 6 years including the location at 16th street I will no longer come here and I will stop telling people to go here. It's unfortunate but it's the truth this place went straight into the gutter.",

Though, in reality, it feels like nothing is close to anything in Phoenix.  She said that she sends people there regularly, and she gets good feedback from those she sends.  One of the things I loved about it: it's not just another Tex-Mex restaurant pretending to represent the cuisine of this vast country called Mexico.  Their menu features dishes from all around Mexico and unless you can't break your non-adventurous self from burritos, then you'll probably experience something new and delicious.    By the way, our party of four did not experience any of the others' comments about poor service.  The young woman who served us was prompt, cheerful, courteous, attentive, and was happy to take a group photo of us using my phone. She was even rather easy on the eyes for us four men.  I'd recommend the place.",

Our drink order was taken care of right away and our food order was placed .. we waited a while for our food .. be prepared for a long wait and they weren't crowded or busy..  The food however when it arrives, is full of flavor and the portions are generous.  On today's visit I had the three taco plate with rice & beans.. the tacos are served with double tortilla, the filling has great flavor (the pickled onion although pretty to look at on top of the tacos did not compliment the tacos, way to acidic).  Try the salsa bar there are plenty of delicious options ..",

    "text": "Dropped by La Santisima on a Friday afternoon around 1:00 pm to grab a late lunch. Initially, I had a bit of a hard time finding the place, but it was bit easier to see once I located the parking lot behind it. There was plenty of seating inside and we were given water and a giant bowl of chips after we were seated. In terms of food, I literally cannot start talking about anything else before I rave about the salsa bar. There are literally 10+ selections of salsa from guacamole salsa to sesame salsa and more typical salsas like salsa verde. I went berserk getting a bunch of the salsas and tried a good deal of them. It also helped that they gave us a giant heaping pile of chips to try all the salsa with.   In terms of actual food, I got the La Santisima Veggie taco and the Mexica Ahuacatl taco. My friend on the other hand had the 3 taco plate with rice and beans. Both of the tacos I ordered were guuureat though I did like the La Santisima Veggie taco a lot more than the Mexica Ahuacatl. I did steal a bite of my friend's rice and beans and it was also super delicious! My friend enjoyed all 3 of his tacos (2 meat, 1 fish) even though his order was slightly incorrect. Overall, the food was great and service was good. The only downside was that they didn't have the guacamole when we went! Definitely need to go back and try it!",

The best taco was the chorizo and potatoes, there was a lot of flavor and soaked all of the taste buds. Will definitely come back for more. Keep cookin la santisma!",

    "text": "Oh, La Santisima. I had this placed bookmarked as one of the places to check out when I was in town. I knew about the downtown location, however due to the parking and the location I was pretty iffy about it. When I learned that there was a second location with a private parking lot behind the shop, I jumped at it. I came here with some coworkers that were hungry for something new so as always they accompanied me in my food adventures.  So let's see, this building is right off a main road and it basically looks like a house. I got a little lost and turned a street early and had to get back on the road to turn again.  Inside the restaurant there were a lot of portraits of Dia de muertos (Day of the Dead) artwork and other artworks such as Luchadores on the walls which I thought was very interesting and it's something that I usually see when you go to a Mexican restaurant. It gives the restaurant an identity and something memorable when I think of the restaurant. There's indoors and outdoor seating, we sat inside as it was getting dark and it was still 100 degree weather outside.  I ordered the Al Pastor Burrito, which I can say wasn't really on the menu because I basically asked for it and wanted to see what they had. They obliged, and when it came out it was different as it had pineapples in it which was pretty interesting. I think even if they left out the pineapple, it would've been tasty. It was good. The restaurant also sported a full salsa bar, and you could get as much as you wanted and there were so many options. I didn't really use it other than to add some heat to the burrito. However, this burrito was pretty awesome, and one of the best that I had when I was in Phoenix (out of the limited amount of places I went to).  The Mahi Pastor Taco, was just okay. This was ordered after I finished the burrito, and we were just talking. Why not keep eating? So, the taco was pretty simplistic which wasn't bad, but I think it lacked a little bit of flavor. There wasn't really any special about it, but I keep thinking about the burrito. So if you're deciding to get this taco compared to the other ones, I say pass on this as you're probably missing anything.  And well, a margarita is a margarita. Nothing unusual or special there.  Overall, it was great. I think I would come back here if I was in town. The amount of food that you got compared to other places were comparable. We came here on a pretty empty night so the service was pretty good. I can't say for all times during the day, but my experience it wasn't bad.",

The tacos mole are my favorite of all time.   Their guacamole, featuring mango chunks and raisins, is addictive. And yeah, most of the salsas are hot, but they're made for adventures. Hot strawberry salsa? To die for! If you're the tame type, try the cilantro, or pecan salsas. Both are fairly bland.   I also love the decor and service. Lovely paintings by talented Latin American artists, sculptures indoors and out, a pleasant, cheerful wait staff -- what more can you ask for? My wife and I had lunch there last week, and both of us left stuffed to the gills. All told, our appetizer, two entrees, soft drinks, and salsa plus chips, set us back only $25.

If it were up to him we would be here at least 3 days a week. We had no idea this place was on Trippe D we just knew Jason V. and many of my fellow yelp friends really liked this place. We decided to give it a try and now it's our go to spot. Not only do they have some really great taco's as advertised but their, burritos, salsa's, margarita's, and horchata are some of the best I've ever had. So far my very favorites have been their Cabo Shrimp Taco: Corn tortilla stuffed with beer battered shrimp. Shrimp was giant, crispy, and tasty. Their Green Chili burrito and their horchata! I usually dont like horchata at all but this one is addicting. It is topped with a drizzles of caramel, strawberries, and pecans and you can just taste that it's home made. We have a had great service, and I find it strange that there has never been a wait. But hey I'll take it, more for me!! We recently brought my mom and her husband here and they too loved it. So I will be seeing you next Friday!!",

    "text": "Well the horchata was ok.  I guess the first issue.. ordered street tacos a la carte that were supposed to be 1.95 but somehow they decided the bring out the plate w/ rice and beans because this was supposed to save money.. well it didn't.. I didn't ask them too.. but hey.. thanks i guess lol.  Stay away from the carne asada tacos. The meat is poor quality.. too much fat and it makes for a greasy taco..this in my opinion is a pretty bad asada taco. The mountain of cabbage doesn't help it's overall lacking in flavor either. Pile on the salsa, those are really good. Also it's reheated which is standard practice i guess but some of these pieces were pretty black.. living in a mexican household you know this happens when you reheat the meat a few times. I could not tell the difference between the street taco and the more expensive arrachera taco. Meat quality = same.  Burro was solid. Salsa's great.. no chip refills. All in all for 70 bucks.. not worth it. That's 12 tacos rice and beans, 1 burrito, and 5 drinks.. this at Los Taquitos would cost me $40ish. However those tacos are ridiculous good unlike here.  Don't get what the fuzz is all about.",

I ordered the al pastor burro and was disappointed, little meat with alot of al pastor sauce, and to much secret sauce. I like the whole concept of mixing spicy with sweet as I got chunks of pineapple in my burro, as stated on the menu. And my michelada also came with a sweet and spicy rim, which i loved. The michelada was delicious but a bit pricy, $18.00 for two. Overall I was disappointed, would I go back? Sure, just for a couple drinks.",

The server was by herself handling the entire dining room and bar at supper, and as a solo diner, I was last priority. It took me all of two minutes to choose what I wanted--a single taco--but it took fifteen minutes for my order to be taken. If I hadn't been given the chips, I would have given up and left. In the meantime, I saw people who came in after me get complete service because they ordered drinks.  The chips were excellent--very fresh. I like the salsa bar but the lighting was poor back there so it was hard to see what was what.  Finally a male server joined her and he took my order. My Aztec chicken tinga taco came out about five minutes later. It was excellent. The chicken was very tender and tasty. Just the right about of spice. It only took about five minutes to catch the server's eye and soon enough I was on my way.",

    "text": "Really disappointed in this place, the two stars were  only given because the restaurant and bathroom was clean and the only saving grace I would recommend is the \"cochinita pibil\" taco. Let me begin by saying we came in sat down restaurant was empty waitresses were talking amongst themselves for a good 8 minutes before we were greeted. Cool not a big problem they are only human. The menu had a terrible background which made it hard to see the selections and I kind of wished our waitress interacted with us and suggested some good eats. It was like a hi here's the menu Be back in 10 kind of service. I ordered the Hochata because of the good reviews husband ordered a sprite. The hochata had walnuts with strawberries, but the strawberries tasted very acidy which threw off the drink and the hochata was very watered down. The complimentary chips were cold,stale and burnt.  It was nice they had a salsa bar but they weren't anything special the cups were so tiny you had to go multiple times(not a deal breaker as I can see it as cost effective for them I suppose.) The restaurant was cute but very tiny. My husband's order was \"meh\" from what he said  he ate only  half. I ordered the three taco plate because I wanted to try the selection here's where it gets interesting: the \"cochinita pibil\" was pretty good if there's one stand out thing I can say in that menu it's that! Tasted as good as authentic. It was the only solace for me. The other taco I ordered was the \"Al' pastor\" guys this taco was so bland and dry and fatty not in a good way but when you bit into it it was literally chewy pieces of pork fat there was more fat then meat. The worst taco after this was the Mahi A'l pastor\" it smelled really bad. I've had mahi before and it wasn't the regular smell it should smell like however I thought well I'm pregnant so I thought maybe it's just my hormones and smell sense. Well I decided to give it to my husband because it was giving me nausea and I thought nothing of it til we left and I asked him what he thought of it. Now mind you my husband is not picky and loves fish loves the outdoors eating deer wild things etc. but he said \"I took one bite and almost threw up\" it tasted like the smell of cow manure I couldn't swallow the first bite.\" So we both guessed late that it was spoiled. He didn't want to make a fuss and I thought it was just me. But nope we were right. The only thing that crosses my mind is as a cook as a server why would you think it would be alright to serve this to someone if it smelled awful? We paid 40 dollars for three tacos,beans rice and one burrito and two non alcoholic drinks. Which was pricy for the quality to be so disappointing. That was enough for me to say on to you guys that be very cautious in going here. I do not recommend it and we will not come here again unfortunately.",

Iist not like they didn't have space in the restaurant. It's really a good size. But for some reason they thought it was smart to put a large party right in front of the entrance door. I ordered to go and it's taking a while for me to  get my meal. So much for to go. Not a great part of town, just a bit of blight. Safe, tho', just the environment of this part of town leaves a lot to be desired.",

I got a few of the cochinita pibil tacos as well based on another yelper's comments, and those we indeed excellent, but the burrito for me was the real standout. The pairing of tahini and smoked pepper sauce is a total winner, and is very interesting given the history of middle eastern food in Mexico.   Also, don't skip the horchata. It has strawberries and nuts, and is devoid of the chalky horchata mix that many places had. Best horchata I've ever had - and like burritos - I've had my share.   My only complaint was the chocolate mole taco - it was far too sweet for my taste, and had too much mole on it and ended up being overpowering. However, if you love super chocolately moles, you'll probably like!",

If you ordered anything else you gone screwed up. Leave, come back and order El Gaucho Quesadilla. As you consume the best thing on the menu you will instantly feel regret for ordering anything else as well as regret for never being able to order anything else on the menu. I wanted to give this place 4 stars but El Gaucho is well worth the 5th star alone.  (Update 3/21/16) They seemed to have ditched the reggae for Spanish Rock!

They have a strange salsa bar, a lot of \"novelty\" salsa. Interesting for sure.

Incredibly pleasing choices ranging from mild n' smokey to furious, flame-grilled. Warm chips are served and the menu is brimming with delectable, hot choices including burros, quesas, and super-tasty fillers.   Firstly, the pecan-fruit filled horchata is like a cold, lingering dessert. And it's huge, perhaps +32ounces of deliciousness. Spoon, please!  The Mole Chicken burrito was on the *sweeter* side and although super complex and dark choco-infused, it called for 3xpinch more spice to counter the sucrose.  The beans and rice are fair to fairly good, but nothing special. I've had great refried beans in my life and La Santisima could improve on this. I'll admit.   The melted queso dip pleased the eye but must be consumed ASAP, prior to cooling down. Order prior to entree.  The la House burro was very savory, filled with shredded, grilled chicken and finely chopped fixings.  Service was genuine and sweet. Hoping to have a party their soon!   A clean, cozy, artful gourmet taco shop is what you can expect from La Santisima.    Next visit:  margaritas and tacos .",

I didn't like any of them.  The menu was unreadable. It needs to be simplified and made more readable  We didn't order the tacos $14 for three taco plater  We left and had a $7 meal at Big Heng wonderful",

I will tell you this - don't bring your kids here and expect a standard Quesadilla for your kids. The quesadilla was something that I have never seen and it was tastiest thing I have ever had.  I could only finish 1/2 of it and barely that.   They have an incredible salsa bar. Every single one of the salsas are home made.  My friend said that her margarita was the best she ever had.   Absolutely amazing",

Now, where, do I eat!  Let me help out a friend. Go to LA SANTISMA and order the following:  1. A ginormous margarita (double strength = hair of the dog); 2. Order the guacamole and chips (don't be scared off by cranberries and mango - they make the guac AMAZING); 3. Order the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco; 4. Order the Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Shark Taco; 5. Order the El Gaucho Steak taco; and 6. Inhale as much fresh salsa from the incredible salsa bar.  You can thank me later...it's later.",

We browsed online and found this place, though it wasn't supposed to open for another 45 minutes at the time. So we did the obvious thing and drove there and waited in the parking lot until it opened. Totally worth it. The decoration in the restaurant is Day of the Dead I believe and it is amazing. The server was 1 girl who took care of everyone and even made all the bar drinks. She killed it though and was super friendly. I got the Blue Demon Margarita and drank it before I thought to take a picture but it had little blueberries in it and oh god it was the most refreshing drink I've ever had. Never thought I'd say that about a margarita but it was delicious.  My meal was a Burro with red enchilada sauce on it. Normally green sauce is hot for me and red isn't but boy this red had some kick to it. Then again I'm a wuss when it comes to any kind of hot so eh. Was still delicious though. Everyone else really enjoyed their food and drinks. The only thing was that portions were huge so we probably should have shared everything hah.  Great first meal after a hectic flight to Phoenix.",

The customer service was great, we were greeted and they brought our drinks and chips in a timely manner. They have agua de horchata, which is made with strawberry and other fruits that are \"secret ingredients\", however overall it is delicious (it may not be for everyone though!). The food itself though is where it went down hill. Don't get me wrong this picture may look good, but the taste was lacking. The meat and shrimp lacked flavor, although they use spices the taste was very plain and I was not satisfied, I was full just not content. The only thing that was good were the rice and beans. Other than that, I would not recommend coming to this place for tacos.",

    "text": "La Santisima might be a lot of things to a lot of people, but to me, they will always be the restaurant that set the \"gold standard\" for horchata in Phoenix. Seriously, order one, and you'll quickly realize that no one else does it quite as good as they do here.   The original La Santisima, over on 16th Street, has always had a reputation for great Mexican food, which is why most people are willing to forgive their notoriously slow service and long wait times.  This location eliminates a lot of the service and wait time issues. Sure, the setup might not be quite as charming, but the food is largely consistent with what you'd find at the original location. It's nice to be able to swing by here for a horchata and some tacos, without having to make a big \"event\" out of the whole thing.  Santisima's guacamole is quite memorable, being filled with so many fruity chunks that it straddles the fine line between a dip/spread and a fruit dish. Additionally, their street tacos, including one of the better pastor options you'll find, are all very well done. Perfect? No. But consistently good.  Santisima's menu has always kind of intimidated me, because there's just so much stuff that's worth trying. My girlfriend and I are usually a bit afraid to deviate from favorites, but the few times we have done so, such as the time we tried their quesadilla, tells me that there's a lot of great things to be found on their menu.  Out of all your options in Downtown Glendale, this is definitely one of your better ones.  Recommended!",

Rice and beans on the side. Beans were homemade no question about. Not typical, every item we ordered was flavorful, fulfilling, and left us wanting more!   We were most surprised by the Horchata, family recipe with strawberry, melon, cinnamon and pecans! Guarantee you've never seen anything like this. The taste is amazing and a must try!",

I was pretty disappointed this time.   When we walked in we noticed a weird, burnt smell, like burnt meat. It was a little off-putting but not enough to leave. The place was empty but service was still slow. One girl working the bar and serving.   We ordered margaritas and when they came they were almost clear. We thought maybe it was going to be all tequila or something, but when we tried it, it tasted like salt water. We asked for more triple sec thinking that would help. It didn't really. I've never had such a weird tasting margarita before.   The salsa bar was still amazing, but the food was pretty average this time. I'll probably go back next year (if it's still there) to try it one last time.",

Let me start off by saying that there are a LOT, and I mean a LOT of Mexican restaurants in Phoenix; but La Santisima is by far my personal favorite. While many places are good, most Mexican restaurants don't really stand out as they are very slight variations of others in the area.   Their salsas are awesome! And the selection seems to be ever-changing. There are almost always new varieties when I dine in.  While their menu isn't as (comparatively) large as competitors each dish is, their dishes are authentic, distinctive and DELICIOUS. Their horchata is even made in a way that you won't find at most restaurants, and it's fantastic (refreshing,compared to the beverage typically served from a concentrate).  If y'all haven't already given this restaurant a try, I recommend it!",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Phoenix metro.    I ate at this location (never been to the 16th St one) many times because it is close to my square dance club at 59th Ave and Dunlap. I discovered it thru Check Please.  I highly recommend the Marlin Quesidilla, about $15. Sooooo good, crispy outside, like a huge empanada. I can make 3 meals out of it, as some of the salsa bar items can be a meal in itself. Marlin tacos are great too.   I suggest you bring your own little salsa bowls to bring to the salsa bar, because they only provide little plastic sauce take-out things that are so small and shallow, you cannot dip anything in them, and you have to go back to the salsa bar get more again and again.  There is something in the salsa bar that looks like pickled sliced green tomatoes with onions that is really delicious.  Fruit horchata is delicious too.  I suggest you have them put the ice in separate cup, or your drink will be all watered down.",

Also, because the baskets have paper covers on top there is no way to use as vessels for their amazing salsa bar, so you have to use the tiniest little plastic cups to try out the salsas and make about 10 trips to get enough of every kind you'd like.  I would have given this place 5 stars but I do not like paper bits on my food.",

First we were given a can of soda and charged $3 for it. 2017 let's get a fountain system you cheap bastards. We tried the tacos and I was really excited after reading the other reviews and wah wah, flat and not filling. After we left we went to another taco place because we were craving good tacos. I love to spend money on good food and this was not it. The quality of the food does not match the high prices. If you are a foodie you are better off at a taco truck, any taco truck.",

I have only had the carne asada and al pastor street tacos, with beans and rice, and have no complaints.  Perhaps my favorite thing is the salsa bar, I am really partial to the Seven Chili's and the Salsa Mexicana, but there are so many great choices.  My only complaint is that on 2 of the three occasions we have been there, they have been understaffed on the front end.  Food comes out quickly, but not always the best service.  We never had our water refilled, and it took three requests to get a beer brought to the table.  Can't blame the server, they have been busy, but management may want to reconsider how they staff.   Overall, this is becoming on of my favorite go-to spots for tacos.  If the service improves, I would bump it up to 5 stars.",

We understand that servers and cooks come and go but if all you can do is offer excuses then don't offer anything. Just stay quiet and try to bring the delicious food you serve as best you can. 1 hour on a Tuesday night just to get chips and order a drink? 3 tries to get an order of mole tacos correct? Order a mojito and get a margarita? Anyone that has spent time in and around the service industry understands that some nights are tougher than others. This now makes 4 tries in a row where your service and professionalism were quite frankly....disgusting.  We love your food but until you can somehow prove that your attitude towards service and quality relationships has changed we will not be back. Very disappointing.",

It seems like they just decided to hang ugly paintings instead of actually painting the walls, they are very dirty.   Our service was ok, but I assume she was new. I ordered 2 tacos a la carte and my boyfriend ordered a meal which comes with beans and rice. We then headed up to the salsa bar to accompany our chips. There were sooo many to choose from. I loved the green salsa and who would have known salsa made from radishes would actually be really tasty??  Our tacos were great, the beans didn't taste like they were from a can and the meat was cooked perfectly. The only issue I had with my lunch were the taco shells, I feel like they were a little too soggy.",

Parking seems like it could be a hassle at times.  Another Yelper says they park at the school when it is not in session.  This time I noticed the back gate was open with an empty lot on the other side of the alley but my server could not tell me if it was ok to park there.  The salsa bar is always a delight and I try to limit myself to two per meal so I can keep track of what I am having.  Service both times has been OK but sort of an afterthought.  I will certainly keep this place in the lunch rotation.",

The servers are friendly and you will be seated promptly, but beyond that  expect a bit of a wait.   Atmosphere is not the best, its actually a bit dull.  But I do like the decor, which is dia de muerta and graffiti type canvases on the wall, and beautiful solid wood doors that I wish I had at home.  So why four stars?  The food is good!  I have had the Sonoran Carne Asada Taco, Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, Cabo Shrimp Taco, and the Sonora Arrachera Quesa.  They were all very good, but my favorite was the Sonora Arrachera Quesa.  Very fattening, but well worth all the calories.  They have a salsa bar with a diverse array of choices, and I do enjoy the all the exotic options.  Oh and the Horchata is decent.  Unfortunately, I believe they will not last too long.  It is always empty, and they are closing earlier every time I visit.  Maybe location is not the greatest, and the service is sluggish, but I really hope they stick around.",

It just so happened that we were already coming back to this area for vacation, and this was the first place we ate at in Glendale because she previously had such a good meal.  So my expectations were very high because it's all she has been talking about.  And I was not disappointed! First of all, the salsa bar is huge and offers so many diverse flavors. Pecan? Peanut? Radish? Along with the more traditional salsas. Here's a tip, try mixing the Pecan with the Rabano Pibil (Radish) for a great combination. My personal favorite was the guacamole salsa, it definitely has some heat.  I had the El Goucho Quesa and it was amazing. It's like a deepfried quesadilla, with amazing argentine seak with tons of other goodness inside. The Oaxaca cheese is so good sprinkled across the top along with avocado slices.  Another thing that beat my expectations - the house margarita. A little sweeter than the usual margarita (flavor comes from grapefruit juice) and if I weren't driving I would have had 2 during the meal.",

Maybe because I'm Mexican, I wasn't falling over myself about the salsa bar  Horchata was good, although I'd recommend asking for light ice since its 4$ for a 32oz cup, and they throw in nuts and fruit in it also. Finally got  a quesadilla. I basically paid 24 bucks including tip for a soft drink, Horchata, rice and quesadilla. All of which weren't outstanding, service wasn't and since this is my hood, I know that the surroundings aren't worth the price tag either. Recommend you NOT go here and seriously if a salsa bar is where u get ur rocks. Then u obviously don't mind paying for it w the normal tasting food, that is waaaayyy overpriced.",

My hubby got 4 different tacos to try and couldn't pick a fave he liked them all so much!  I got the veggie quesa, a twist on quesadilla made with a crispy corn shell - it was delicious yet huge I couldn't even get through half!    I'd highly recommend checking this place out!",

But this place seems more like a gourmet taco place you would find in Mexico. Real  authentic ingredients put together in different ways. I had the shredded pork tacos. The pork was so tender and flavorful, they didn't even need salsa added to them. speaking of salsa, this place features a salsa bar with around a dozen different salsa varieties: jicama salsa, peanut salsa, radish salsa, just to name a few of the crazy ones. To top it off, there's some pretty amazing artwork on the walls. Even the bathroom doors are beautiful. This place is a must try! I'll definitely be back",

I had NOTHING bad, or even average here, it was all amazing.  Cute, trendy/rustic decor, and the food is outstanding.  The mole was so smokey and rich and flavorful and the Mayan cochinita pibil taco was so tangy and tender.  Seriously, I ate until I literally could eat no more.

This place fills the niche for good Mexcian food that isn't heavy and greasy. It was empty when we walked in but there was a steady trickle of people in and out. The waiter was extremely friendly. He explained portions of the menu to us, chatted a bit, and the service was prompt and polite.  The salsa bar wasn't all that I'd hoped for but it was interesting. Lots of different salsas but many of them were spicy and I didn't really love any of them. Hubby did though so that might just have been my issue. The food, on the other hand, was delicious. Hubby had mole and it tasted like mole is supposed to taste. Like chili and chocolate and all sorts of yumminiess rolled together. I had an Arabic burrito which was much more delicious than it sounds. They happily made it without onions for me and it was awesome.  Oh, and order the horchata. Trust me. They make it in house and if horchata tasted like this all the time I'd drink it way more often. Parking is in the back and there is a surprising amount of space considering they're on the edge of downtown Glendale. I also appreciate that the parking area is VERY well lit.",

The guacamole with mango, cranberries and jicama seemed odd but I was intrigued. Ended up being the best guacamole I have ever had.  The beer battered shrimp and baby shark tacos were delicious. So good. And last but not least, the quesadilla was amazing. Very similar to an empanada in that they took raw tortilla, stuffed it, then deep fried it. Blew my mind. So good. I might order from them again tonight. It's a little bit of a ride from where I live (25 minutes) but definitely worth it.",

I always fill up on chips and salsa because there are SO MANY - my favorites are the cilantro and chipotle salsas and guacamole; tip: mix the chipotle salsa with a spicy one for a kick because it's not at all spicy!   Service: usually good. The credit card machine was out once... Not a huge issue for us or anyone I saw walk in but would have been disappointed if we didn't have cash.  My only complaint is that they serve the food in baskets and I would prefer plates (I think this is new... I can't remember) but I can work around that if I must... And I haven't asked for a plate, which I could also do",

    "text": "Was very disappointed with our last visit here. Now I can be very honest, they had two large parties but was not jam packed. I was in the restroom at the time of the drink order and my family did not order me anything. When the waitress came, she took my order but never came back with anything. I waited around 20 minutes for someone to come back and I once again placed my order.  From the time we sat down we knew it would be busy but never expected we would have to wait over am hour for our food to come. Not once did a waitress offer to refill our drinks and when someone did come by to offer more chips, they were given to the wrong table. Okay, we understand that stuff happens and large parties can throw people off but once the food came, we asked for 2 small plates as we were sharing with kids. Once again, the waitress never came back and the kids ended up sharing our plates and eating off of napkins. A more seasoned waitress came, and we expressed our frustration, the most she could offer was an apology and to discount our drinks.  My husband and I made an observation and the waitress who would leave a table after taking an order would go and clean tables instead of bringing what we asked for. It was a very disappointing experience.",

    "text": "This is hard to write because every other time I have been here I have been very impressed.  Unfortunately it only takes one bad visit to ruin it for me entirely.    The menu finally changed, I am not sure at what point but everything on the menu has gone up in price.  I ordered a quesa which I was used to at a cheaper price.  I get it, things get more expensive as time goes on to a degree.  The service was astoundingly poor and this one hurt us the most.  The waitress barely paid any attention to us and we were the only ones who were inside eating.  There was a large group of employees who were all conversing and we were definitely left on the back burner when it came to attention.  I asked for silverware and she just pointed to the plastic knives and forks over by the salsa bar.  Five minutes later I witnessed the waitress placing the rolled silverware on all of the tables...except ours.  We also were never given a water refill or even checked up on.  We sat for about 10 minutes waiting for our check until I finally lost my patience and had to ask for it along with a to go container.  The last element that I really did not enjoy is the fact that the food is served on straw trays with a cheap wax paper on top.  When you are paying $14 for a menu item and eating with plastic knives and forks on a thin piece of paper...it just does not feel right.  It's too cheap for what you pay for.    Overall the food really is very good but has become much more expensive and when you are eating with a plastic knife and fork on a bogus plate along with a staff who could care less, I just can't justify giving my business there anymore which really is unfortunate.  This is a hard one to let go!  But the good news is that there are plenty of other spots around here in Phoenix that want your business and will appreciate it so go forth and discover them !",

They have a salsa bar with a multitude of labeled salsas you can try, our favorites were the peanut salsa (creamy with a hint of spice), the tomatillo and the chipotle.

(I trust her opinion...she was born/raised in San Diego, and she knows what's up when it comes to Mexican food!)  We finally made it down here the other day for dinner.  We parked in the back lot, and walked inside.  We were greeted immediately and shown to a table.  We were served a basket of chips, browsed the menu for a bit and then placed our order.  I went with a plethora of tacos which included a fish taco, a mole taco, a cochinita pibil taco, an al pastor taco and a carne asada taco.  Here is how they were.............  Fish Taco-  They make these with dogfish.  It was a hefty sized taco and it was mighty delicious.  It had 2 pieces of perfectly fried fish inside.  I had never had dogfish until today.  It was a very meaty and chewy fish.  Most fish tacos are white fish that break apart easily.  This fish was almost like a steak!  I would definitely get this one again.  Mole Taco-  Shredded chicken with a rich mole sauce service on top of a double corn tortilla.  It was good, but not my favorite of my selections.  Not sure if I would get this one again.  A tad messy, too.  Cochinita Pibil Taco-  This was roasted pork shoulder topped with pickled red onions.  The pork was nice and moist, and the onions gave it a nice bite.  I would get it again.  Al Pastor Taco-  This taco came topped with a a decent amount of pork, some hot red sauce, some cool avocado sauce and also some pineapple.  It was definitely tasty.  Maybe not on par with my Tacos El Gordo in SD, but still a good al pastor taco.  I would get this one again.  Carne Asada Taco-  This was my favorite of the day!  This taco came prepared simple with just steak and some cabbage (It's an AZ thing..the cabbage).  This steak was so well marinated, and so tender, it was a pleasure to eat.  I wish I would have ordered maybe 3 or 4 of these things.  It was by far the best carne asada I have had in AZ, and could hold its own vs any asada back in SD.  It was incredibly legit!  I may come back and get this in a burrito from here.  Winner, winner, carne asada dinner!   Besides the great tacos, this place has a super awesome salsa bar!  They had at least 10 different, home made salsas on display.  I tried about 5 of them and each one was unique and tasty.  They have great chips, too!  Thin and crispy!  They went well with all the great salsas.  We got 2 baskets full.  Service was on point and all the young ladies working in the place were on top of everything!  I'm glad I went here and will definitely be coming back...soon!  Best Mexican food I have had in AZ so far!",

They had one waiter who was trying to take orders for all of the table. I won't speak on behalf of anyone else so our experience: it took our food 45 minutes to come out and when it did, my tacos were so dry I could barely swallow it. As the waiter set down our food she asked if everything was OK. After that, we didn't see her until I had to send my food back. My mom and I both had to send our plates back. In the 45 minutes we had to wait for our food, we asked for chip refills.. those took roughly 15 minutes each.. and they charge per basket. When our chips came out, we had little pieces of chips and our basket wasn't even full. The ONLY positive was the salsa bar.. when you had chips to eat it with.   Bottom line.. not a great experience.",

That's not my Mexican food at all. La Santisima is.   The location is across 59th. Ave from Old Town Glendale so not exactly walkable from Old Town because who wants to cross Grand and risk death by car. There's a small parking lot in the back of the restaurant though.   It's never very busy when I've been for a weekend lunch or dinner. La Perla next door can be packed with patrons and 20 tables will be empty at La Santisima some weekends. That simply means less hassle to get some of the best food you can find in Glendale.  I would recommend trying anything with arrachera in the description and the al pastor tacos. Their seafood choices are bangin' too.   Their salsa bar will challenge your ideas of what a salsa can be made of.   If you want to go for lunch or dinner at La Santisima and you can't find a date, I'll go with you anytime.",

I'm not going to give it 5 stars now, even though 6 months to a year ago I would've given it 5 stars (is 10 possible?) For some reason the prices went up and the quality of the food feels like it has been steadily declining. Everytime we go its just not what it used to be. Maybe there's new management? A new cook? I'm not sure. But if you had asked me 6 months ago about the place I would not have hesitated to recommend it.   Its definetly authentic though I'll give them that. I love this restaurant and really hope that the quality starts going back up because I miss eating there. It was the only restaurant my family and I would go to. And with the new vegetarian options. My goodness, I would eat here every day!",

I'm always reluctant to give negative reviews but I have to be honest so that we spent our money in the right places. I liked in on a positive note so I will  start with what went wrong. As soon as we entered we were confused as to whether to wait by the door or see ourselves. Turns out we were able to see ourselves but upon sitting I noticed a lot of the chairs were stained so I felt a little uncomfortable. I managed to find a somewhat decent chair and my husband and I ordered tacos which is normally our first go to at a place where unfamiliar with. I like that they had so many different sauce the choices that was really great. We ordered cups of water with lemon which came in cheap throwaway plastic cups. When the tacos came our plates looked cracked like they were ready to be retired. I had three tacos And out the 3 I ordered I only liked one...same for my husband. We were pretty much done at that point. I thought it would be hard to mess up street tacos but apparently not. On a good note the salsa and chips were good and the waitress was kind.",

My boyfriend order a large salad(mind you, the last time we ordered this salad we shared it with three other people) when they brought it out it looked like a side salad! I couldn't believe it. The waitress said that they changed the sizes and that she would bring us more because we weren't told this. We waited and she never did.

Exterior was really original and set a good vibe, then we stepped inside and I felt like I was in a tattoo artists bedrooom.   Took about 5-10 minutes for someone to come out of the kitchen to greet us and seat us which was not a good first impression. The salsa bar had good variety but was set up very poorly. The \"togo\" salsa containers you use to grab you salsas were so small you couldnt even fit a tortilla chip into it, We had to get a plastic spoon to get our salsa onto our chip because there was no metal utensils on the table. They didnt provide us little plates either so our table was a mess before we even started ordering.  As our tacos hit the table the first thing we noticed where that both mine and my husbands plates had big cracks on them. Flea market much?I got the smoked marlin taco which had the texture of canned tuna fish with a minestrone like vegetable concoction on top and the shrimp tacos, pretty decent. The corn tortillas were pretty flimsy though and resembled the storebought el paso brand.  Service was not the best either, our questions about the tacos were answered with finger pointing at the menu and blank looks like...uhh you dunno what achiote rojo is?   All in all, the fact that we said we should have gone to chipotle instead says everything.",

We had everything from Burro's to Street Taco's to SPECIAL Taco's.  The overall opinion was just OK. Let me speak on my 3 Carne Asada street Taco's with beans and rice. Taco's were not even close to being hot. Not even warm. Meat quality and tenderness was poor. Beans were GREAT. What the hell is white rice doing in a Mexican restaurant? Had better at the same price. Had to ask for chips and more water. Poor teenage waitress was worked. I realize they add 18% automatically but then don't ask for another tip on the check. Service and food was not worth 18%. Would we go back NO. Too many Mexican restaurants in the valley to have poor food. Oh well you go you might enjoy it. It's your money .",

The people are new and are being trained so that should improve. I swear one of the servers also works/worked at the original. This location is just as hard to spot though. Small building, but plenty of parking in back.  I'm a huge fan of the original. Been there multiple times. I was much more impressed by the mole being served here, but not so much the dogfish. It was still good, but seemed to be more batter this time around. Cabo shrimp and marlin are good at both locals. Two taco plates with rice and beans and two horchatas = $25-30  I finally have enough experience with these restaurants to complain just a little bit. 1. Go back to putting the rice and beans in cups or bowls please. I am begging you! I'm so tired of my tacos getting soggy from my beans spreading across my entire plate. Get plates with ridges and sections or something. Something! Anything! 2. The music IS REALLY LOUD at both locations. I'd like to not have to yell at my dining partners. 3. No pecans in the horchata anymore? Did I miss this menu change or was it just a hiccup at the newbie?",

I liked the chips, salsa bar (because of the variety but I only tried the Mexican salsa and guacamole salsa), avocado salad side and decoration portraits but the tacos, burrito and horchata were not good. The tacos were plain, the chicken in the burrito didn't have flavor and it was served on a broken plate and the horchata didn't taste like actual horchata. Also, there was only one another party so I don't understand why the service was so slow. I definitely would not go back!",

Meats I chose were carne  asada, mayan pibil and the Aztec  tingi. The carne asada was dry and not flavorful and i didn't enjoy the taste of the tingi taco.  the last taco made it all worth it the Mayan pibil was delicious and I can't wait to have this again. They marinate the red onions in lemon, this simple touch makes the tacos so much better.  Javier had the red beef burrito this was very spicy but he enjoyed it.  We also had the house Margarita. They put lemons and orange slices in the drink.  This was an excellent margarita and for 8.00, I think this was a great deal. Our total bill for 2 meals, 2 beers and a Margarita was 37.00. The only down side to this place was the old plates. They were not the glossy ones and had chips and paint missing. I know it goes with the decor but i think this could be worked on.  We will be returning to try more food from this taco shop.",

Nasty standing water by salsa bar. This food better be good! Weird way to get to the salsa bar where you have to twist and turn. No utensils or napkins on tables. You have to ask and wait.    Positive.  Music and atmosphere is good. The outside patio looks nice. The prices are decent and they look to have a good vision. They have really nice art work but walls need painting.  Seating is good and looks nice wooden tops and cast iron details.  A bit more attention to details and some training will have this a destination for Glendale folks who want authenticity yet do not want to go near the hustle and bustle of Westgate.",

I sent my food back twice and it still came back to me wrong.  The waitress didn't speak a word of English and could not understand at all what I wanted. I ordered the exact same entree I had the last time I was here but it was a totally different meal that was delivered to me. I even showed them the picture I posted in Yelp as to what my food should look like. They tried to match the picture, but they had no clue. So disappointed! I could go on and on, but I won't. Again I don't recommend going on the weekend.  The thing that shocked me the most was even after the horrible experience with the food being sent back, I had to pay the full check. If a customer sends something back twice and it still comes back wrong, they should not be charged.  The food should be the same no matter when it is ordered.",

Maybe 5min after I arrived, a pregnant girl walked by and held up a finger in my direction as if to say \"I'll be with you in just a minute\". After about 15 min, I was finally acknowledged by someone and given some chips. At least 30min after I arrived, I still hadn't been greeted or spoken to by an employee. I counted at least 4 other tables of people who had arrived after me and already had drinks on their tables. One of them even had their food already. Still, no one came by to take my order. I felt like I was on a hidden camera tv show at this point. There appeared to be maybe 3 servers, and the restaurant has maybe 10 tables inside, with a handful outside. It was busy, I understand that, but this experience was ridiculous. I finally gave up and left. It's hard to imagine a business that operates this way being able to survive.",

We had the Gaucho, which is an Argentine marinated steak taco with fresh avocado, and the Oaxacan chicken mole taco- unbelievable!  The best part is the salsa bar- amazing flavors and textures.

The menu was large with very different types of tacos and burros you don't often see.  As mentioned by others,  the salsa bar was excellent with lots of choices with a surprising (and tasty) fruit salsa!  I was slightly put off as we ordered our iced teas at lunch and they were delivered in wax paper cups which was not what you would expect in a sit down restaurant. Then the meal came in baskets like you might get at a Sonic drive-in which was also a little disconcerting.  However, the meal certainly made up for these drawbacks (which in the end is the most important quality!).  We had the lunch plate with a small paper cup of beans and another with rice but believe it or not, I was very full at the conclusion of the meal and even took one of the corn tortilla off one of the tacos as I was 'stuffed'. Overall, I wish they had served on regular plates and regular glasses but the food was excellent. The service was also attentive but not intrusive. Will definitely return!",
