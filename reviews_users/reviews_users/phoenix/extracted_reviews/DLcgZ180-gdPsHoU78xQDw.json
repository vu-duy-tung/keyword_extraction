This is a place to go maybe if you live really close or have some sort of emotional connection. I personally prefer other breakfast diners.",

The corned beef had no flavor, the gravy tasted like flour, the biscuit was chewy. I ordered the number two. My eggs were cooked as I ordered them, and the pancakes were decent. But my bacon was another failure. I like it extra crispy. I ordered it that way too. It came out not crispy at all. After spending a few minutes attempting to flag down our waitress, she took it back. They cooked it some more, and it looked crispy. But it was still not crispy, which is a sign of bad/cheap bacon. Their sausage was also not good.  To make it worse, my food was either cold or lukewarm.   We got prompt service - the drinks and food came quickly. But once that happened, we were ignored. Water glasses were empty and remained that way. Coffee not refilled.   Also the staff seemed very inexperienced. We were sitting near the computer, and it was clear that the staff didn't know who was taking what table.  The servers also didn't know what table food was assigned to.   Their prices were too high and we did not care for the food or service, so we will not be returning here.",

Regardless of when you eat it, I would suggest you eat it at Joe's diner!  They may have moved locations, but you still can't beat their breakfast sandwich!  I have never had anything that I could say was bad at Joe's.  I once said that I could close my eyes and point at the menu and end up with something yummy.  I am still pretty sure that holds True.  Portions are large and probably not the healthiest but if you are going to splurge on breakfast, you might as well have one of their fabulous buttermilk pancakes, or biscuits and gravy (which you can have with spicy chorizo if you choose), or one of their combos, or that breakfast sandwich that I literally dream of...  like I said close your eyes and point.  You won't be disappointed.",

I was stoked so today the hubby and I went there for a Sunday morning breakfast; something we used to do a lot when we were first married.  We got there right before 10 and had no problem parking and were seated right away.  The owner was our waitress and the staff was friendly.  We gad some delicious Arbuckle's coffee which was hot too!  Love they had Sweet N' Lo too.  The hubby had the Western Omelet which came HUGE with a generous side of seasoned home fries and toast or buscuit.  He had whole wheat toast and enjoyed the homemade apple butter as well.  I had 2 eggs over easy (perfect ) which came with the same huge side of home fries and toast or biscuit.   I had the toast and homemade blueberry jam which was FANTASTIC! So glad we went and tried this great local breakfast place and we will be back!",

However, every time I come in the wait time to be seated is a little long (that's important because I always have seniors with me). One visit we were told to seat ourselves and after five minutes asked to move because the section we sat in by the entrance was closed. The atmosphere is classic American comfort, yet the staff does not match the setting. It makes for a bit of a tense and uncomfortable mood. I know it could be overworked staff or low pay so I tend to give restaurant employees the benefit of the doubt. I will continue to come to joes but if the service stays the same I will convince my family it's time to choose a new diner",

His fresh buttermilk pancakes are the best pancakes I've ever had. The hostess is lovely. She's autistic and Joe has given her a wonderful opportunity for her to learn, grow and work. There should be more community restaurants like this with people who care but aren't caught up in anything but good food, great values and good people. Thank you Joe. Your restaurant is a Phoenix institution and will be for years to come!  Go get yourself some pancakes!",

My dining companions tried the burgers and pronounced them delicious.

I ordered the scramble, meat lovers and it was more than enough for one person! I probably could have split it with someone; I did end up taking half home. Mine was a little dry so I asked for a side of sour cream.  My sister ordered two eggs, potatoes and toast-hers was a little greasy for her liking so she soaked up some of the grease with napkins. Jason ordered the chorizo omelet, very tasty!  Good flavor.   One nice touch, the owner came around to every table and made people feel welcome and asked how their meals were.",

The chorizo gravy and biscuit waa better than expected; I am not a biscuit and gravy person but theae were good, pretty sure someone who enjoys it would find them fantastic. My all time fav, corn beed hash was nice and crispy   Their coffee is amazing, not bitter, no gimmicks, just a great cup of Joe.  Read many reviews complained about the price. Not sure what other people are looking to pay for good quality of food. If a chain restaurant is more of your liking, avoid this place, you may be dissapointed about their menu selections and great flavors. I'm from NY, and paying $8.75 for corn beed hash is actually a bargain. Can not put a price on good comfort food and friendly service.",

The food isn't going to be as fancy pants as you might find at some of the breakfast joints in the valley but that doesn't mean it isn't delicious!   Joe (I think?) was making the rounds and gave me some additional hot sauce that wasn't on the table (cholula/tabasco). I thought it was too vinegary personally but I appreciated the gesture and being referred to as \"hot sauce guy\" was amusing.  Of course, I finally came here the week before I'm moving farther/further(seriously which is it?) away.....I suppose I can suck it up and make the 7 minute drive.",

    "text": "I had noticed this place a few times at it's old location and thought it was in an odd location. I drove by the current location and didn't realize it was the same restaurant until I looked it up online. The location is a much better one than the old one however they still have quite a bit to work on if they are going to make it over the long term. The Owner/Manager was waiting on tables and there seemed to be no managing of the restaurant. People were waiting to be seated or to cash out and no one seemed to be in charge just who ever was free. They seemed to have enough help, just poorly managed. The workers were all friendly and once we were seated we received prompt service. I noticed the Biscuits and Chorizo gravy and decided on the \"Number 1\" as they were included. My partner chose the Chicken Fried Steak which was covered with Sausage Gravy. The Chorizo Gravy had an ok flavor but the Sausage Gravy was much better. I was told that you could choose either and I would go with the Sausage if I ordered them again. Also, I thought the Chicken Fried Steak was a much better value as it came with Homefries, eggs and a biscuit for just a bit more. I noticed some other reviewers commented that the Ice Tea was not great. I ordered it knowing this and I agree. It was very weak and had an off taste. The Coffee was very good though. I understand the menu is limited (as are the hours) but maybe they will work through their Management issues and can expand both their hours and menu as I would love to see them make it and they have most of the parts to make a successful go. I will certainly be back as the Country Fried Steak was very tasty and overall it is a good value. I suggest giving it a try and read your fellow Yelper's tips as many were spot on.",

    "text": "When we first walked in we didn't know whether to wait to be seated or seat ourselves, being our first time there, so we just stood there.  We waited long enough to consider leaving and going somewhere else.  There were under 10 people in the restaurant and no one was up front to greet us.  Finally one of the employee's told us, from the back of the restaurant, that we could just sit anywhere we wanted.  We were given a high chair that had to be wiped off first before we could even use it.  The server wasn't very friendly, my husband asked how she was doing and she said nothing then said, \"what would you like to drink?\"  We both ordered the number 2--- two bacon, two sausage, two eggs and either home fries or two pancakes - we got the pancakes. We got our eggs scrambled with cheddar cheese added.  The star of the breakfast was for sure the bacon (nice and crispy) and the pancakes.  The eggs and sausage were good, but they were nothing to write home about,  just the everyday eggs and sausage.  For the little one, I got a scrambled egg and some buttered white toast.  The toast was nice and thick, perfectly toasted.  The cost for all three of us to eat with a $5.00 tip was around $32.00, not too bad and the food was good and the portions were  big, especially the pancakes.  The inside was a bit drab.  Considering it was a diner, I expected a more upbeat 1950's vibe with bright colors and some music, it did not deliver and the bathrooms were kinda scary and had a bad odor to them. They have been at this location for about 6 months now and I would like to recommend a sign for when customers first come in that says \"seat yourself\" to avoid confusion on what to do, spruce things up a bit to look more like a diner and work on de-funking those bathrooms! Overall, it was just o.k. I don't know if it left enough of an impression for us to think of when we are looking for somewhere to eat.",

During my meal I was never asked how was it nor was my coffee refilled. After I was done eating it took another 10 mins for someone ( not my waitress) to clear my plate. It was another 5 mins I had to wave someone down to get my bill. I was given the wrong bill and told the lady its not mine and was promptly asked if I was sure. WTH!? Yes I know what I ate. She just said just pulled up my seat in the computer and that's what is was. I told her what I had and she went and got the correct one.

    "text": "We visited Joe's on Tuesday, July 7th at approximately 11:00am.  Wow!  Seriously...Way over priced and some of the food was terrible, not all.   First off, price. You can get almost the same amount of food and decent quality at the local chain for at least  a 1/3 less the cost.  Almost all the breakfast selections were near $10.00.  We like to support the local merchant, so this is a big part of why we decided to try Joe's.   I see that they have gotten pretty good rating here on Yelp, but our food was so bad I literally could not eat it. Two of the 6 of us ordered the corn beef hash and eggs.  The hash was seriously the consistency of runny oatmeal.  Hidden under the over medium eggs.  I can eat just about anything.  I literally could not gag this down.  When I called the server over she immediately agreed.  I said I would have the same as the person sitting across the table form me, the other person who ordered said she would pass on another choice, lost her appetite. So I waited and waited and finally my meal came out.  They did take the corn beef hash and eggs off our ticket, but the added the meal that was my second choice, for $2.00 more.  So not only was my first meal absolutely awful, my second meal that I had to wait for cost me $2.00 more than I planned on spending.  Not good customer relations in my opinion.  We will be hard pressed to visit again.  Only giving 2 stars because the pancakes were good.",

Original review for July 2017: We just moved to the area and came here for breakfast on 4th of July, hoping to find our new go-to breakfast spot. Unfortunately, this isn't it.  I'm not sure if they forgot about the holiday or just weren't anticipating that amount of customers, but it was busy and they were understaffed. Despite that, our waitress was very sweet and really on top of her game. She keep our coffees (which were excellent) and waters full and noticed when we didn't receive our toast. Excellent service: 5/5.  Although they serve large portions, the food was just okay. Biscuit was dry. Pork chops were low quality and over-cooked. Overpriced for the quality. Food: 2/5.",

It was clean and it was busy yet I really enjoyed a great breakfast  Joe was a great guy and I am going to return again soon as I'm done with this review... well as soon as my radiator is replaced right now... then I'm going.  Why five and not four stars? Are they perfect? No they aren't however it was a great breakfast on a day I wasn't felling well and that I felt good afterwards it was clean, although busy not too loud at all. I was recognized as a person not a paycheck as I felt I should be treated and joe the owner took tine from other guests orders to sit and talk with me although he wa short staffed and talking orders himself. I felt respected there and I left wanting to just sleep the day away I was so full of good food",

After reading a few Yelp reviews I chose this place, and I was very happy I did.   Very friendly service from both the hostess and server. This place has that old diner feel which I really like. It was very clean inside. It wasn't overly crowded either. And there is even a counter you can sit at if your by yourself.   My food came out and everything was so tasty! I got a waffle, eggs, bacon and sausage. All the food was of decent quality and prepared perfectly.   Plenty of parking in the private lot is available.   On my next trip to Phoenix I wont think of eating breakfast anywhere else but Joe's.",

The diner seems to be one of those places that has been around for a good long while and the Clientele all looked to be regulars. I ordered the pancakes, and there's something about them that makes me nod my head agreeably. They're more on the hearty side than sweet, and you don't even need to douse it in syrup to appreciate them. They stand alone and are good even with just butter. The rest of the food was standard diner food. I can't say I love the place, I don't think it was my vibe, but I can see why they have regulars, and I respect that. They're a plain-jane type of diner that delivers the staples of breakfast food just fine.",

    "text": "5/5 for pricing as the deals and single item options had great pricing. Options for $10 and under even a few $5 or less side items for light eating. 5/5 for food as the quality of food was beyond what I expected from a small diner in Phoenix (came for the weekend from California) and was impressed by the variety of food options and the actual quality of the food that was served was better than expected but the one negative was the speed of the delivery which impacts the next grade on service. 3/5 on service unfortunately. The waitress was attentive to getting me refills so I'm grateful for that but the food took a long time to be served. I understand that it's a small diner and that food is cooked to order but it probably took 20-30 minutes from ordering for the eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon(2,2,2,2)and the waitress didn't  really converse with us  or smile much but those small things can be overlooked. A good spot to check out if your in town",

Like endless hot coffee that's really smooth and mellow? They even sell the coffee they use and I think I need to buy some next time.  3) The corned beef hash. This is not something that jumps out at me on a menu, but it is excellent! Super crunchy and covered in three eggs. My favorite breakfast entree. 4) Chorizo gravy. This is Arizona. Eat some chorizo gravy.  5) The pancakes. These are soooo buttery. I don't want to know how much butter is in there, just let me be happy. Eat at Joe's!",

The bacon, chorizo gravy and eggs  were good, spicy!  Selection  of tea when you get hot tea.  I  won't  go back, too many other choices.when I spoke to the female owner /wsitress/cashier about the eggs, how the boiled eggs were different,  not what I wanted, unappealing,  not as good, her reply was that they cook poached eggs 3 1/2 minutes  because that is the law...that is the minimum, but you can cook them more!!! I explained  that I get them that way every place I go and if places like Dennys ca get it right, there is no excuse for them or to.  It was like  talking to a brick wall.

We drive out from Chandler past 700 other breakfast spots because she used to live in the area and the biscuits with chorizo gravy can't be beat (I've tried).  I don't mind because I always have a good experience.  Joe and Joan are the owners and really care about making sure the guest are happy.  Joe can always be seen making his rounds talking to people and more often than not Joan is serving tables herself.    This past weekend I tried the corned beef hash and my girl ordered the biscuits and chorizo gravy with a side of bacon.  I think we waited about 5 minutes before Joan who was serving us stopped by to let us know that we were going to be waiting a few extra minutes for some biscuits to come out of the oven.  We didn't really mind and the food was great as always.  The corned beef hash was perfectly crispy and the yolk in the eggs over easy were just right.  They were happy to let me substitute toast as a side, and the bacon is always on point.  When we were ready to pay the bill Joan let us know that she was comping that tab since we had to wait, which I assured her was unnecessary but she insisted.    I felt extra bad because I didn't have any cash to tip but our next stop was the Arizona Animal Welfare League and SPCA where I felt compelled to pay Joan's courtesy forward and donate the 25ish bucks I would have spent on breakfast and her tip to the charity in their name.    Sorry I didn't have cash to tip you Joan, but hopefully you know that the positive energy you and your husband put out to your customers and into your food is appreciated. We'll be back!",

My burger was a joke. The bun was mangled and part of it was missing. One piece of romaine lettuce that was 90% rib, a grim slice of tomato that was mostly white core and the size of a 50 cent piece and my fresh mozerella in a weird pile in the middle of the beef. Once probably warm and melty now a congealed blob. My waiter delivered a bottle of mustard and the most nasty bottle of ketchup ever, with dried spilled ketchup from some other diner, i didn't want to touch it. I asked for my onions rings, he left and came back and told me he forgot to order them. I passed on a re-order. The beef was tasty, but everthing else was way below par.

First be careful walking up to the door, the black out stuff over the door doesn't just block out the sun, it blocks out everything. My hand got rammed as I didn't see someone coming out. Don't you go in/out the same way you drive on the road in the USA? Well, she didn't get that memo.  Two young ladies greeted me and told me to sit anywhere. I sat and was quickly greeted by Amanda. She asked for my drink order, I really wanted coffee, and asked if she had FuFu coffee. I liked that she understood what I was asking for because I like the sweet/creamy/flavored coffee, but she said No, just regular coffee. So I got a soda.  When she came back with my drink I ordered the Chef's Special Corned Beef Hash. I wanted my yolk to be runny and asked if that was sunnyside up. She suggested the eggs to be flipped, I assumed it was the same thing so said yes. Not sure what happend, but one egg had some runniness, the other one was cooked through. The hash was well done and tasty. The biscuits and gravy was okay... the gravy had a few sausage pieces and when I say few, I really do mean 3 pieces. Its one biscuit and it was okay. I guess the meal as a whole was okay. Maybe my expectations were a bit high but I could have made a bit better biscuit & gravy with eggs how I wanted.  As I waited the diner quickly filled up with people. I noticed the lady who took my order was pointing out to the other waitresses, a bill was ready, a table to clear, a coffee cup needs filling, etc. As it got super busy I waited for awhile to get my check. Leaving the place I noticed that a majority of the spaces were filled, including the lot behind the building.  The atmosphere is casual, the tables will be changed out with advertisements from other business', so if weren't bombarded with ad's everywhere in your life, you'll be eating with more in your face.  Would I be back? Not sure....",

    "text": "Went for a quick bite while waiting for my puppy at the vet.  -my wife ordered scrambled eggs with bacon and potatoes. The eggs appeared like the powdered eggs patients receive at the VA (tasted like them too). The bacon was barely warm. It was also dry as though it had been resting under a heat lamp. For the price, I expect fresh product rather than food that was clearly sitting out after being prepared.  I had a burger and fries. The fries were fair, however the burger was greasy and sloppy. The worst part was the bun which was also greasy, not crisp and was dense. Less than 20 minutes later as I write this review, my stomach already hurts.   On leaving, my wife stopped in the rest room. She reports that it looked like a bathroom from a carnival or truck stop.  Suffice it to say, I won't be returning. Overall, it was a greasy disgusting mess.",

The pancakes are so good and even better as part of the #2 menu item.  Two pancakes, bacon, sausage and eggs prepped your way. It's a big tasty meal!   My friend ordered the biscuits and gravy and said he really liked them.  I think I've just discovered I really do not like country gravy. On the other hand, I really like turkey gravy on anything.",

We were all very happy!  Everyone else said that the eggs were exceptionally fresh-tasting, and then spent the rest of the meal trying to figure out how 'fresh' tastes--apparently, it tastes great!  I was happy with toast and fruit, especially since there was homemade cherry and strawberry jam on the table.  Amazing.    Service was fast and very friendly, and prices were very reasonable for breakfast (about 7-10 per person; less for my fruit/toast).  The space was clean and seemed accessible if you use a wheelchair (large open space near tables at the front of the restaurant).  Thank you, Joe's!",

Food was out in a flash, yet the eggs were obviously cooked fresh and my request for over easy was cooked properly.   As an ol country boy from TN, I have made the search for decent biscuits and gravy in Arizona a personal mission of over 7 years now.  These were good contenders. The gravy is primo.  The biscuits were good but not quite as outstanding as the gravy.  An extra minute or 2 too long in the oven can make a great biscuit reduce to good by making the bottom a little tough instead just firm.  Therfore, 95% of each biscuit was actually great as well.   Coffee was also excellent. I drink it black and I don't love $tarburnts.  If you like old school black coffee with coffee in your coffee, then Joe's has that ebony nectar your grandparents loved.    I will be coming back.",

My husband ordered the corn beef hash served with three eggs over easy, and biscuits and gravy. Our food arrived after about 20 minutes: fresh and hot. Everything tasted wonderful, with the right amount of seasonings. I tasted my husband's biscuits and gravy--and the gravy was not overpowering--I could taste the sausage in it, and it had a nice blend of spices. The service and food is outstanding. The prices are reasonable because they feed you here--the portions are large, you shouldn't leave hungry. I like it when I can go into a restaurant and have excellent service along with delicious food. Its the best of both here at Joe's Diner.  We will return in the future.",

Our waitress Carrie made you feel like an inconvenience for being there and she was not pleasent at all. When we sent back the waffle twice she was no where to be found. If it were not for Joe coming by our table and another waitress named Layla helping I would be rating one star. Joe is the owner and introduced us and made us feel very welcome. If this was based off of Joe and Layla alone I would be giving 5 stars! The pancakes were VERY good, the waffle was sent back twice till it finally came out crispy(thank you Joe and Layla for making sure we left happy). As a fellow server my advice is for Joe to get more severs like Layla and your reviews will be all 5 stars. Definitely asking for her if we end up coming back to try this little place again.",

I was really hoping to find a local diner with delicious breakfast that I could go to with three of my best friend, my Seinfield diner if you will, but unfortunately, this just wasn't the case.   The inside is like a small Village Inn. very typical, very boring, and no pie.   Our server seemed extremely overwhelmed, even though it wasn't super busy (we came in for a late breakfast). She was pleasant, but nothing exceptional about the service. We ordered pretty basic breakfast items, and it took an exceptionally long time to get our food.  I ordered the number two, which had sausage, bacon, pancakes, and eggs, which is a lot of food. Unfortunately, it wasn't great. Both my pancakes and sausage had been burned. I was happy to have the bacon as a back up which thankfully, was cooked perfectly. The eggs were pretty basic, but I didn't have to make them so they were worth it. I stole a few potatoes from my boyfriend, and I will say, they definitely know how to make breakfast potatoes. this should 100% be your side choice.   The best part about this is they definitely don't skimp on the orange juice. I did get a giant glass of OJ which was ..orangey.   In my opinion, it was a little overpriced for the quality of the food, but you will definitely get a lot of food on your plate.",

    "text": "Go to Joe's Diner if you want good food because they've got it. Especially breakfast, which is excellent. Everything I've tried at this place (and their original 16th St. location) has been great. It's not cuisine, it's diner food and it's done right.  On the other hand, if you also value good service with your delicious chow, forget this place. On previous visits, the service has often been spotty, but it's easy to cut them some slack because the food's good and, after all, it's a diner. This morning I spent an hour and ten minutes sitting at Joe's counter, with only about 20 minutes devoted to actual eating. And I never got a second cup of coffee.  After the folks sitting next to me -- who came in after I did -- received their food, I flagged down another employee to inquire. Apparently, the server failed to give my order to the kitchen. Eventually, my breakfast bowl arrived, hot, delicious and, maybe even worth the wait. The server mumbled an apology for its lateness but had to be asked to provide me with utensils.   About that coffee: The personable young woman who took my order was careful to explain that they were out of their special cups for decaf drinkers, so I should watch out in case someone tried to give me a refill with regular. Indeed, the VERY SAME SERVER came back to me later with regular coffee and tried to put it in my cup. As instructed, I stopped her and said I was drinking decaf. My cup remained empty and that was the last I saw of my server.   And this was the last time I'll visit Joe's. Great eats just aren't worth the aggravation of being ignored.",

There were 4 in our party we ordered.  1) #2 Two eggs* with two sausage patties, two bacon strips & a short stack of pancakes - (Eggs cooked well, bacon & sausage patties warm but need to cook bit longer, pancakes tasted good more like a flap jack)  1) Breakfast burrito - Made of three scrambled eggs, chorizo, potatoes, Cheddar cheese & a side of sour cream & salsa - (Lots of flavor and filling)  2) Eggs Benedict - Hollandaise sauce tops two poached eggs on Canadian bacon sitting on crisp english muffins - (Great taste eggs done well, hollandaise nice flavor but needed to be more on the plate, canadian bacon and muffins both needed to be cook/toasted longer)  Over all not bad for a first try. Worth giving it a second shot we all have bad days.",

    "text": "So I had an extra early am appt before work and was done quickly. Consequently I was way early for work and wanted to stop and have a sit down breakfast. Of course I turn to yelp since I was in an unfamiliar area. It's hard to find a good old fashioned diner instead of coffee joints these days. The first place I stopped was a coffee joint...*strike* the counter guy was nice but that'll be another review lol. Next I found Joe's Diner. I walked in about 0645 and there were about 4 other diners seated. It smelled slightly musty probably because they just mopped so I can't complain about that. It's nice and clean inside. The smell didn't last at all and wasn't overbearing The server was very friendly.  I received a menu, items are very well priced ($ as posted on yelp) I decided on the corn beef hash because it came with 3 eggs and 1 biscuit and gravy. When the food came I received the eggs and b&g but got a slice of ham instead of the corn beef hash. She was apologetic and took and replaced it. She left the biscuit and gravy so could start with that, which I might say was *awesome!* I asked for the chorizo gravy, and so should you :-) then the eggs and corn beef hash came and I almost passed out out was so good! I only wish I lived closer to this place so I could come here more often!!!",

    "text": "so DISAPPOINTED!!! I was visiting Phoenix from Seattle. I was excited to try Joe's Diner and support a local business. Unfortunately, our waitress got my order incorrect, so I re-ordered. The waitress suggested a subsitution with my original order, which sounded better so I accepted her suggestion. She then brought me the wrong food, AGAIN!! I didn't want to cause a scence, plus I was hungry and my friend had already finished eating.  I tried to eat the item she brought out but I couldn't because it has an ingredient she said it wouldn't come with. Needless to say, I asked for my orignal item. Finally, my \"breakfast burrito\" arrived... I was happy and about to start eating when  gentleman approached our table. He said to me,  \"The next time you come to our resturant , can you please read the menu\".  I WAS SHOCKED!!! I couldn't believe one of the employees was saying this to me. I tired to explain there was a miscommunication between myself and the waitress. I was trying to be diplomatic about the situation and did not want to say she got my order wrong TWICE. This person continued to say (all smug and righteous) \"please read the menu the next time you come in because I've never had a customer return two meals before\". At that point, I asked the gentleman if he was the manager/owner and he said he was. I then told him, I've never experienced something like this before. I then told him I was shocked that we were having this conversation. I told him, his approach was making me feel like I did something wrong. He wasn't listening. He continued to smile and smuggly say \"all I ask is that you read the menu\" ... he then said \"this waitress has worked for me for 16 years and she has never made a mistake\". At that point the table next to us said, \"She got our order wrong too!\"...   I really hope that Joe's Diner reads this and that gentleman thinks about how he approached the situation.   I totally understand if an employer wants to stick up for thier employees (I applaude that) but when the \"manager/owner\" attacks the customer without understanding the situation, well, I had to post this review.   I hope the Melrose area gets more restaurants in the area... I would love to support them. ...   I'm so sad that this experience has left a nasty taste in my mouth for Joe's Diner.  One last note... not only did I receive the incorrect meal 3 times, I paid the bill for the food my friend ate and the final breakfast burrito.   The waitress seemed scared of this gentleman.  I don't know what was going on with her that morning, that caused the mistakes. I left  her a $2 tip.   I'm not a jerk.. I worked in restaurant business for many years.  As those of us who have worked in that industry know when you are dealing with a \"bad\" customer AND we know when we are being \"bad' customers... no way was I being difficult.   As I'm typing this review up, I'm still shocked with my experience at this diner :(",

Only open from 7am to 3pm, offering breakfast and lunch. One would assume, they have some skills making traditional breakfast fair. We ordered eggs over easy with bacon, and hash browns and some pancakes. The eggs were barely runny, almost lukewarm. The pancakes were just ok. I totally would have sent back the eggs, however our waitress never came back after dropping the food. Never made another appearance, much less to ask how everything was, or to refill our waters. We actually ordered milk, but it was never delivered. It's disappointing when the meal goes bad, and the service isn't there to make up for it. I tried to catch a server, any server to at least get our bill. Ok so, I would understand if the restaurant was busy, and our server was zipping around working her butt off...but no that wasn't the case. I had to get up and walk over to the first employee I saw, and request our bill. By this time, I had almost forgot what she looked like haha. Finally! She makes an appearance to drop off the check. Unfortunately, the bill had the 2 glaases of milk we never received on it. By this time we just wanted to leave our cash on the table, and go.But instead had to make another trip to find the server on the way to the register. At last, I am up at the register getting the bill straightened out....and finally she inquiries about our meal!",

    "text": "Sunday 11/24.  Out for a Birthday lunch.  Been to Joes several times at old location, but this was my first time at the new location.  Missed being greeted at the door and having to seat myself.  After sitting for 10 minutes without one person acknowledging the fact that we were there was very disturbing.  Mind you there was 4 waitresses on, only 4 other tables in the place and two of the staff were doing their side work on the booths on each side of us. Sooo after waiting for 10 minutes I finally went up to the front register, I think it was \"Joe\" who appoligized and promptly came over and took our drink order.  BTW, we still have no menues.  When he came back to the table he did have menues in hand.  Not even 20 seconds later, one of the waitresses who had been doing the sidework around us but failed to acknowledge us came and asked if we were ready to order.  Ugh No, we just got our menues.  Once our order was placed we thought we were in the clear until another waitress came over with a Ice Tea picture full of sugar and sat it on our table while grabbing the sugar dispenser and proceeded to fill it at our table without saying one word to us, then walked away. \"AMAZING\" not to mention rude.  Of course when the food came everything was wonderful as always.  When we received our Bill, I proceeded to the Restroom while my Friend went to pay the bill.  To my surprise when I came out, he was still standing at the register.  I waited another 5 minutes, so now were talking almost 10 minutes at the register while two staff members are sitting at the counter eating.  I actually called their phone and a waitress came from the back with broom in hand and I told her I'm at the front waiting to pay.  Joe also appeared from a side room and asked the waitress what was wrong, and she told him that we have had a horrible experience since we arrived, \"JOE\" I presume, groaned and walked away.  The waitress did comp our Beverages without asking because she felt bad, but then to top it all off, she said we should come back when they are bussier, their much better then.  Not sure if I'll give it another try!!",

If I didn't know they had only been here a few weeks it would have been a one star review.  For starters Joe assumed my mother in law was my wife, which started things off a bit awkward, but then it took roughly 30 minutes to get our food.  This was attributed to there being 'half power'.  I ordered the chicken fried steak with the cherizo gravy and when it came out, it was undercooked and the breading was mushy, and they didn't put the cherizo gravy on it.  I sent it back and they were quick about replacing but forgot the cherizo gravy again.  I asked for some on the side and it was watery.  Out sever seemed frustrated as well and I had to ask for simple things several times, silverware, water refill, things that should be monitored by a good server. I will come back to Joes, but not for a while, I will give them a chance to get their footing at this new place before going back.",

My veggie omelet was the only thing hot on my plate, but was dry. The biscuits were so cold and hard the butter didn't even melt. My friends got the biscuits and gravy and his was cold too his 2 eggs over easy were so undercooked that the egg white was still runny and not cooked. Giving them 1 star in hopes that the lunch menu is better than the breakfast. I'm hesitant to even waste time and money to try it.",

It's the kind of place you feel comfortable hanging out and chatting even after your meal is done. It was good diner fare food in a welcoming environment. There was a little jar of jam on the table and at first I was excited that it might be blackberry (but it wasn't), but it was still good. I felt very welcome and cozy here.",

I go to pick up my burrito and it was just an average size burrito with no extra salsa on the side.  I had to ask for the salsa and when I went to pay I was charged over $10.00.  Yes........$10.00.  I asked for a manager who did refund me my money but no discount off the burrito. I left.  Beware!  Chaotic and unorganized for sure!",

It tasted ok, but wasn't really an omelet. the ingredients weren't folded inside, they were mixed in with the eggs. Like scrambled eggs. And then cooked and folded over but it was broken it half.   It came with home fries which tasted ok too but they were 8/10 on the grease factor.  The marbled rye toast was flawless. And the coffee tasted good too, although the waitress took a while to refill. I didn't like the pancakes much. Very thin and the batter was a little chewy inside. But the syrup they have on the table was great. Better than average for artificial.   Overall this place was not horrible but the food wasn't good enough for me to return. I honestly prefer the omelets at Denny's.",

I think they found booths somewhere and shoe horned them into the existing layout left behind by the Chinese restaurant that was the previous tenant.  Really this is as bad as it gets.  I get this is a diner but come on.    The food kinda went with the service; uninviting.  The coffee (and I will drink 7-11 coffee) was just bad.  The potatoes were boiled and then warmed up on the flat top - no crispiness at all.  The chicken fried steak was doughy and under cooked.  Corned beef hash was out of a can and under cooked.   The biscuit was the single shinning moment of the day, first rate.  The service was uninspired but fine.  I didn't expect this place to supplant Matt's but there are a half dozen places within a 5 minute drive that will get my business instead of Joe's.",

It always starts with such promise. Time to sit and look at menu and someone brings you a drink. Then you order and the hell begins...  An hour this time (on a Thursday at 10:30) we ordered from the menu no changes. That's when the server disappeared. 38 minutes later she reappeared with two plates of food which she quickly deposited and booked it away.   Want to know why?  Because our food was so cold except the bottom from the heating plate. Butter wouldn't melt on pancakes but it would spread. Ugh really?  Guess what happens then?  Yep 17 minutes of trying to get her to come on by. Finally she does and we get it taken off the bill. Not like we ate any of it. Seriously has this place really given up? Too bad.

    "text": "Me and the little woman love to go to Joe's now and then and I must say it is a great place to meet if you are wanting to have breakfast with a few friends. Excellent round banquet tables, with lazy-susans always make the meetings fun and easy to converse with one another and pass the homemade jellies.  Joe was a big fella like me once and most of the menu is not friendly for us low-carb peeps. However if you order the Joe's breakfast bowl and substitute fresh spinach for the home fries, it is a very tasty zero carb item that will suffice. Get a side of bacon, it's terrific.  Thanks Joe",

Those things were so delicious I could have spent $20 just eating them.   The food was served hot and fast. All at a reasonable price. My one negative is their menus isn't as quite as expansive as I was expecting.   I do have to say the fact that my only complaint is their selection really speaks to the fact that I really enjoyed the restaurant.  I look forward to my next visit and highly recommend it to anyone in the area",

When they moved locations they lost the diner atmosphere and luster.  Not only that but the food isn't the same, seems that maybe some recipes have changed.  I work at a restaurant, over by the old location, and used to tell people, who wanted breakfast, to go to joes and enjoy some awesome biscuits and gravy.  Sad to say I can no longer refer people over there.",

But, I just didn't like the food. I ordered the breakfast sandwich which was eggs, sausage and cheese on a croissant. The croissant was ehhh ok. The eggs/sausage/cheese was greasy and not very flavorful. It came with a side of potatoes which were also pretty m'eh. I'll give this one another shot at some point.",

Not like ihop; the real kind that are thin and griddle-yummy. Biscuits and gravy; apparently I was wrong about hating chorizo because the gravy is about as good as you'll get in phoenix. The only better is the cream gravy at Texaz on the chicken fried steak. The breakfast potato cubes are delicious and well seasoned.  The good: corned beef hash could have been a bit crispier. The eggs I requested very softly scrambled could have been a bit runnier; it seems they were just scrambled as usual. The chicken fried steak was okay, but clearly came from a bag of frozen steaks. Even the delicious gravy it was smothered in could not mask this observation. At the $10.99 price, i expect more from a diner. f you want a genuine chicken fried steak, wait until Texaz Grill opens and get a monster real one for less. I am from Texas soiknow what I'm talking about here.  The bad: the sausage patties. I hate to dis a sausage anything, but the patty was cold and 'gamey'. Go for extra bacon if you can. Bacon was a bit cold and hard, but still better than the sausage.  Overall, I like their food and will return to try the Monte Cristo which sounds fantastic.",

    "text": "Best pancakes in Phoenix. Or as the Fonz aka Henry Winkler calls them \"pancakes from Heaven.\"  Joe's Diner is the local watering hole. The breakfast water cooler of sorts. Where you go to find out the latest news about your town. Or enjoy a morning with friends, chatting over a cup of coffee.  It's not the typical place you'd expect an Emmy Award-winning actor to seek out. Nor a tourist. But that's where I found myself shortly after arriving in Phoenix. Sitting in a booth near the jukebox, listening to the conversations around me, and enjoying a simple breakfast.  When I choose to eat at Joe's Diner, I didn't know that the owner, Joe Seriale was a classically trained chef. Nor that he had cooked at the Fairmont San Francisco and the Boulders Resort & Spa.  Unlike a modern hipster diner trying to be retro, Joe's Diner is the real thing. A Rowe AMI jukebox machine sits against one wall silent, unplayed. Possibly forgotten. A reminder of what once was and is no longer.  It's a seat yourself type of establishment. Choose from a red or green vinyl booth or a nondescript table with stacking chairs, the type you'd see at church or school.  Laminated faux woodgrain tabletops featuring business cards and ads from local businesses. Old gas station signs and photos reminiscent of a day long ago.  It's quiet. There's no music or TV. You can have a conversation and hear the conversations of others.  One waitress running the restaurant, taking orders and busing tables. The way it used to be before big corporations and their franchises rolled in.  Regulars sit in the same booth every day. Men talking about golf, AA meetings, and Bible study. Where it's not uncommon for heated argument between family members. Mother against daughter. They leave for a few minutes and then come back, order their food and enjoy their breakfast in a state of detente. Cold stares across the table. Soundless except for the clattering of silverware against plates.  The food at Joe's Diner is homemade from scratch. Scratch meaning starting from nothing. You won't find a bag of Krusteaz's or Bisquick pancake mix in the kitchen.  Jams, jellies, biscuits, gravy, croissants, pastries, and of course, their pancakes are made at Joe's Diner. Fun tip: They sell 3,000 pancakes a month. Twice a day they make pancake batter and three times on Sundays.  They make every effort to source and use local ingredients. Their flour, coffee, cream, honey, and chorizo are all produced in Arizona.  Despite being a diner, prices were high. Higher than I had expected. This was Phoenix, not San Diego. An $11 meat and cheese omelet? A $10 breakfast burrito? Visions of saving money no longer danced in my head.  The best value items are the:  Pancakes - $4.79 for a short stack or $5.79 for a three stack Waffles - $5.99 topped with strawberries and whipped cream French Toast - $5.99 Biscuits and Gravy - $4.49  Waffles are my go to. But today I wasn't in the mood for carbs. I wanted protein. Something light and not too heavy to tide me over for the two-hour drive to Sedona.  Eggs.  The two eggs special comes with seasoned homemade potatoes and choice of toast or biscuit for $7.99. Tip: Order the two egg special separately a la carte from the sides menu and save $0.22. But my hips didn't need the potatoes so I ordered an egg and toast for $3.98, not including tax.  My over-medium egg was over easy. But the toast. Oh, the toast.  I love a good hearty piece of bread, especially wheat or a multi-grain bread. Gluten all the way baby! The thick slices of bread were almost twice the size of a standard slice. The only bummer. It came pre-buttered, perhaps margarine or ghee.  But I'd order it again, specifying to leave off butter. And send back the over easy egg.",

The place is a bit dated and the silverware is bent but it's comfortable. It's much bigger on the inside than it appears and there are plenty of booths and large tables if you are going with a group. I love breakfast food morning, noon and night but for some reason I passed over that large portion of the menu and ordered a sandwich. I had the Rachel which was turkey, coleslaw and thousand island on marbled rye. It came with a side of crispy fries. The sandwich was just ok. The coleslaw on it seemed a bit off so I scraped most of it off. My friend had the hot roast beef sandwich which came smothered in gravy with mashed potatoes. We also shared a slice of hot apple pie.",

I don't know what it is, but I think the batter is sweeter. Whatever it is, don't change. From there, I honestly don't think you can go wrong. Biscuits and gravy (regular or chorizo) is always a favorite. While corn beef hash has never been a favorite of mine. I find myself ordering this here frequently. I can't say enough about the food, and then you get the mom and pop service from employees who not only seem to care, but actually want to be friendly. You can typically spot Joe rolling up his sleeves and busing tables right along with the rest of the staff. You're welcome, trust me, you'll thank me.",

When we asked the waitress to take the pancakes back because they were too overcooked, she said she would see if the cook would take them back. When she came back to our table she told us that the cook stated that she could not cook them any differently than they were presented to us. She asked if we'd like to keep the pancakes!  Unbelievable! So we had to either accept the pancakes or order something else. I ordered the cinnamon roll and it was okay.

I was expecting more of what their last location looked like. After reading some of the yelp tips, I decided on their pancakes. I ordered the short stack (2 pancakes), added 2 eggs, and a side of corn beef hash. Total was $8.50. Very inexpensive. The food was tasty and I was in a food coma after finishing my pancakes. Typical breakfast fare.   Service was okay. At first the server was very attentive and then we hadn't seen her for like 15 minutes. Our empty plates were stacked at the edge of the table and we waited awhile while waiting for our checks. Finally I went up to the front and asked if we paid up front. She said we could pay but I still wasn't clear if we were supposed to or not.   I think this is a good addition to the Melrose strip. I don't know that I would come back over other breakfast places in the area but I think this is heads and tails over Melrose Kitchen (around the corner) for value and quality of the food.",

They used to have a vanilla or maple flavor don't know what has changed. Also the chorizo biscuits had a sour taste to them don't know if that is a part of the recipe? They are always fast and friendly here so great fast breakfast on my day off. :) Enjoyed my alone time there today.",

The water could use another run thru a filter, I did leave full but like most breakfast spots in phoenix I just kept thinking what a waste of money. I don't understand why for 11 dollars you don't get a real piece of ham instead of the spam like formed piece I received. They do offer a ham steak but its in the please don't substitute section. Just a total disappointment, I don't understand why you cant offer a fresh and favorable breakfast without charging 20 dollars",

The service was not always the friendliest but that just depended upon who served you.  There was one particular server that was always quite unfriendly (we later discovered that this unfriendly server was one of the owners - Joe's wife) but everyone else was friendly and efficient.  One Saturday morning it all changed.  My husband ordered his usual sausage and eggs, eggs over-medium.  When the server asked how our meal was he was honest and said that it wasn't as good as it usually was.  The eggs were a little under-cooked.  The server told one of the owners (Joe's wife) that we were unhappy with our food and my husband repeated that it was okay but the eggs just were a little under-cooked and that it was unusual for us to have food we didn't like (since we had been eating there almost every Saturday for over a year).  The owner's response was atrocious!  She said the eggs are cooked exactly the way they are supposed to be and suggested that we should read the menu so we know how to order correctly.  My husband patiently explained to her that he always orders his eggs the same way and usually the food tastes great so he thought maybe there was a new cook. She didn't want to hear any of it.  She never even apologized!  She was extremely rude and maintained that he just didn't know how to order his food correctly.  I couldn't believe she was so rude to customers, especially regular ones. But she is so oblivious that she didn't even recognize that we had set foot in her restaurant before.  We will NEVER eat here again. We refuse to support a business with such rude ownership.",

I think it could have come out a little faster since it was just lukewarm when it got to me. But it was still delicious! The eggs were fresh and the cheese was melty. I really like the potatoes it comes with as well. They know how to season a potato!   So I would give this place a solid 9/10! They also serve RC cola which is super rad! I will be back for sure!",

The only meat they have is pork no turkey bacon or chicken sausage or even beef so if your not a pork eater you will not be eating meat here. I ordered a combo it had pancakes , eggs and potatoes. The pancakes were really good probably the best thing I ordered. The potatoes were seasoned well but not hot and the eggs were okay. Its not fancy at all but absolutely serves its purpose for breakfast and good service always helps. Our bill was $28 which isn't bad but also kinda high for a greasy spoon. I probably won't go here regularly but when I feel like good pancakes close to home I would definitely think of Joes.",

You will definitely meet the owners Joe and Deb who are gracious and charming.     But back to the food:   The best pancakes and buttermilk biscuits EVER.   Omelets and eggs made perfectly .   House made jams and good strong coffee roasted from Tucson.   Fantastic sandwiches and salads all fresh and tasting of thoughtful and expert preparation.    Wonderful coffee shop!!!!!",

They are literally the best pancakes I have had, and they are for sure homemade no boxed pancakes here. The food is consistently good. The servers here are prompt. Even if you order takeout the quality does not suffer. Joes is always a good idea. I have never been disappointed in all my years of coming here. It is always money well spent. Every time! Eat at Joes!",

    "text": "I'd enjoyed Joe's Diner in its old location and was feeling good about checking it out in its newer, more convenient spot. Huge portions, good food, good service, what's not to like?  After I'd waited a while at the \"please wait to be seated\" sign, a server called out that she'd get to me in a minute, then went off to take the order of a large table. Okay, maybe they'd been waiting a while, and if you don't get that in to the kitchen, things bog down. Then another server came over and asked which of us in the foyer was first. \"Me,\" I said. The father with two kids behind me said: \"She is.\"  The server then looked right past me, picked up three menus, and went to seat the party behind me, the same party that was clearly puzzled and embarrassed to be seated first when they'd said it was my turn.  My strong suspicion, since I'm very tall and had gone for retro-glam in high-heeled mules and a large hat, was that the staff jumped to the erroneous conclusion that I was either a drag queen or transgender. That's an excellent reason for me to not spend money there: I live in a queer-friendly neighborhood because I like those values (whether I need them to apply to me or not) and there are plenty of places I'm more comfortable supporting.",

    "text": "Real Men Don't Eat Quiche.(1)  So fine, I'll just turn in my man card for a month.  Only served on Saturdays and the ingredients change according to availability.  This generous portion of quiche in bacon spinach form was enjoyed by 3 of the 6 people at our table.  It came with a bowl of diced melons.  Not to say it is the only good thing to eat here as everything ordered at the table disappeared quickly from our plates.  Including a shared stack of pancakes of which I had one.  But the quiche alone is enough reason to get there on a Saturday.  This was my first time at the new digs.  The small parking lot is saved by having street parking along the canal.  There are more tables here but on this Saturday late morning there was never more than a couple of empty tables at any given time.  With the layout large groups have to be broken up.  Service was spot on.  And the owner was visible in the dining room most of the time helping out where needed.  (1)Feirstein 1982)",

You MUST eat at least two: one with butter and local honey and one with butter and owners freshly made cherry preserves. The pancakes are the BEST in the valley; (yes, even better than Matt's & Butter). So run, don't walk and Enjoy!",

    "text": "Well we decided to try this place since it's close to home.. The menu is your standard diner food but I was pleasantly surprised to see the Monte cristo sandwich (haven't had one in years).. We were greeted and seated promptly by a friendly girl of about 17. Our waitress arrived quickly and took our drink order then brought our drinks and took our food order. The food arrived quickly and the waitress(Alina according to the receipt) brought our ranch dressing and strawberry jam we requested. Unfortunately that was the last we saw of her. Another waitress asked if my daughter wanted more ice tea. We ended up having to ask another waitress for our check. Right before we stood up to leave someone finally asked if I'd like more coffee.  It was a little to late.. The food was okay but way over priced for what you get. I've attached the bill.",

The biscuits and gravy, French toast, corn beef hash, and sandwiches are yummy.  We were passing through from Texas to California - the biscuits and gravy meets every southern expectation. Highly recommended!",

Ordered the meatloaf and it was barely warm and the gravy was cold and like jello! Two little thinly slices of meatloaf and nasty mash potatoes. I picked at it for a few minutes and pushed the plate away not even attempting to try the vegetables. The check was given to me before I even took my first bite.   $12 for this garbage? No way Jose this place sucks!",
