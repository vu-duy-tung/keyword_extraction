I have read other reviews that said you have to wait on weekends.  Of course you do.  Its not Mcdonalds, but its not 30 mins of waiting either.  Their happy hour food is great and their beer prices during this time are hard to beat.  The wait staff are great and parking is easy to find.  We are helped within a minute of walking in.  The outdoor patio is great.  You will enjoy yourself here.",

They have a spring training menu, which was fine, but very limited descriptions on most of the drinks and food.  Then we waited for over 20 minutes (menus and all) and no one ever came to so much as give us water, take our drink order, etc.  The waitresses wouldn't make eye contact, so who knows who our server even was.  We gave up and walked out after the table that was sat after us got their drinks.  I doubt they noticed or cared.  We landed at another Mexican food place down the road, just as busy, but with much better service! Plenty of food options in that area, so I will continue taking my business elsewhere.",

I like the outside because they have the misters which make the AZ heat manageable.   However our waitress wasn't very attentive to our needs even tho it was slow. She actually gave us another table's ticket and walked off. We asked to split our check in half,  one of us had a card the other had cash; we wanted to leave her a tip in cash but she ended up deducting the cash and charging the rest to the card. Oh well!

The bar didn't have open seats so we sat at a high top. Immediately a server came up and asked if we would like anything to drink and brought us some water. Our server, Amanda, went over the specials with us and talked a little bit about the menu. I asked for some suggestions and she said we should try the guacamole. We did and it was amazing. The crab flautas are absolutely phenomenal as well!!! Amanda was such an awesome server and was quick with everything and answered all of our questions. She made the experience even better! love it here and will def be back and hopefully be in Amanda's section again!",

    "text": "Maybe it deserves a half a star more for a big patio and great location in the heart of Old Town. The name, Salty Senorita with it's cheesy psuedo Mexican theme, should be well, a place for a sort of a reasonably priced place for margaritas. Reality is, it's overpriced, not to mention watered down. Is it so wrong to use real lime juice when I paid $11 for it?   I wanted to like this place and looked forward to coming here after a friend raved about how great the margaritas were. Perhaps, I ordered the wrong kind as the menu for margaritas was basically a book, a large selection of Russian roulette.    Since we got here a little late, we ended up ordering dinner here too. It was Friday night of the weekend of the major BCS game, crowd activity was a tad slow, but respectable, most were here to hangout and have a drink. I ordered a burger with waffle fries, but the waitress came back with my plate and apologized for not having any and brought me fries, cold fries. Half-star downgraded. I wasn't even offered to choose something else as a side.",

The house margaritas were only $4 during happy hour, but they pretty much tasted like a lemon slushie with a splash of tequila. The house margaritas ($7-8) were better though, and I did see people order the giant fishbowl of a drink with a Corona upside down in it.   The nacho appetizer and tacos were decent, but nothing to write home about. The guac was good so long as you don't mind chunks of raw onion in it (I do). Service was inconsistent at best. One waitress was difficult to flag down when we needed her and the other (after the shift change) was attentive and friendly.  Oh, and they added on an 18% gratuity when there were 6 of us in the group. This is one of my personal pet peeves. Besides that, after we split up the bill they tried to tack an extra $10 onto it AGAIN then claimed that was just how the computer did things. They removed it, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.",

I never return to a place I feel like a tourist. I definitely felt this way. Unfortunate for the waitress as it wasn't her fault working for a restaurant they deemed acceptable to offer mediocrity at best for what is a marquee offering for a Mexican restaurant.

It's one of the top lunch spots my coworkers and I head to in Scottsdale. The lunch menu is fantastic. There are at least a few things on the menu I'm still dying to try and I've had a few varying items already. The fish tacos are insanely good and the lunch menu is reasonably priced. The margaritas are some of the best in the area. I typically go with the salty senorita.   The non-tomato based salsa? The shit.  The decor and feel of the establishment is soothing and relaxing in an odd way and I love it. Additionally the insanely wide variety of music they play has my coworkers and I either singing along, embarrassed about \"that one person we can't remember\", or reminiscing about something it reminds us of constantly.  My real beef with this place is that the happy hour service is a little lacking and heading there after work only to find they switch to valet sucked.",

The chips are so tasty. I'm definitely a fan of the paperthin tortilla chips, served with salsa and pico de gallo, both delicious. My drink never ran empty and we were checked on the perfect amount.  The decor of this place is so cool. It's like a place where a mermaid who's a little rough around the edges would get her drink on. Maybe some sirens too, after a long day of luring in sailors. The bars are adorned in shimmery blue stones and jewels and cool folkartsy paintings hang everywhere.  Our orders arrived, and first thing I noticed: PERFECT PORTIONS! Wooooo! I love going to a place that serves up meals that aren't going to force me to take half of it home to rot in my fridge. I had the chicken enchiladas, and they were delicious. I wish I had more sour cream initially but I just asked for more. I'm usually not even a fan of meat enchiladas but these were fantastic and worth a try.   Another plus: the people-watching. There was a guy talking on the phone by the hostess' podium to who we guessed was a girl.. it was kind of funny because it was pretty heated.   No 'snobs' here, the staff was awesome, food is great!  Four stars until I'm old enough to experience the bar. [;",

I've never had the food here (one of the most common things I have to type on Yelp when I'm yelping a bar/restaurant combo establishment.), but the Margaritas aren't bad.  They often times have really good specials ranging from normal like 1/2 off margaritas to a little on the crazy side - think margarita and manicure for twelve bucks.  Salty's is king of the happy hour and if you work in the old town area, it's a great spot to enjoy the cooler evening temperatures on a happenin' patio.  I'd recommend it.",

However, when we arrived, we were greeted cheerfully by the hostess and didn't have to wait more than 5-10 minutes. We went to the bar and grabbed some margaritas. They weren't great, but they weren't bad, either.  As far as the decor goes, it reminded me of the Saddle Ranch, but with a little less \"cowboy.\" They had a nice outdoor patio area where smokers could sit at tables and they even had an outdoor bar there.  We were finally seated and and the server came by to get our drink orders. She was not the most competent server, and the service as mediocre, but not bad. She would forget drinks, forget to bring things that were requested, and didn't come around enough.   As for the food, it was your standard mexican fare with some unique standouts like the ancho pork tamales or pablano and cheese tamales. I had the carne asada burrito, which was good, but not anywhere deserving of the term \"delicious.\" And at $12.50, not great value for the money.  It was nice to have TVs in there to watch March Madness, but the screens were so small that if you weren't seated near one, you had to get up from the table and walk over to a set in order to be able to see the score.  If you are in to people watching, there is a wide range of demographics that patronize this place. It was neat to see different styles of people from old to young, rocker to preppy all converge on this place and have a good time.  Overall a cool place to get some mexican food. Great name, too!",

Because their ONE blender was broken, and the waiter told us that it was 'always broken'.   Funny though, for all the horrible service we were getting, the suspiciously too-young looking girls in low-cut tank tops were getting more then their fair share of attention from our waiter. Too bad too, because he probably would have gotten a better tip from us if we'd gotten the same service.",

    "text": "I was visiting Old Town Scottsdale for Fiesta Bowl weekend and looking for a fun place to grab dinner with friends. The outdoor patio caught my eye (I'm from LA, I live for the outdoors). Almost every other place in the area had 4 stars on yelp so we just stumbled in without checking yelp's warnings. Big mistake #1. Big mistake #2 was ordering the shrimp and mango quesadilla. It sounds great but new rule - at a bar just stick with the safe food group - chicken. I usually love shrimp but the shrimp in this quesadilla did not taste fresh at all. The taste of it made me feel sick and after trying to pick at it and avoid the shrimp I gave up. I am not usually the complaining type but this was a different story. I needed to warn them to stop using this bad shrimp. Bad fish is no joke. So when the waitress came at the end of our meal I told her that I didn't think the shrimp was fresh. She looked at me almost concerned and replied \"you know next time you should just stop eating right away\" and here I thought she must be concerned for me getting food poisoning up until she added \"because that way it'll be more believable when you leave it on your plate\".   Wow! Really?!",

Things are overpriced because of the location and you need to sit outside as indoors brings nothing to the table.  The crowd is a bit cheesy although that could have been due to the particular night we were there.  Overall there are probably better places to head to especially if you are looking for mexican food.",

The food is as expected at a college bar posing as a restaurant. So we'll skip that part...   Mexican theme + Bar = Margaritas, right?  I'm seriously not sure what they use in their mix, or what's happening to the tequila between the bottle and the pitcher, but something is amiss. We even ante'd up for the premium pitchers and the result was this vile, watery sweet limeade. Barely cold and ice seems to be treated like gold there. No tequila flavor, no hint of fresh juice. Are they using Sysco mixer or something? You could buy Bone Daddy's mixer at safeway and throw in some hornitos and kick the smack out of these. If you have a margaritville mixer, you can even make frozens, if that's your thing.  In any case, skip all around.",

    "text": "Just to preface... I am new to AZ, transplanted from the Chicago area, and this is my first review...  Went there on a Friday night with a group of about 8.  I started with the \"house\" margarita on the rocks, and it was pretty weak, but I asked the waiter for something stronger, and he obliged.  The prices were very reasonable, and the service was prompt.    As far as atmosphere, there was not much to it.  Basically a Mexican themed bar, with a mediocre crowd.  There were definitely some lookers on the patio, but also some Scottsdale trash, so I suppose it has diversity going for it.    The music was all over the place, which I am starting to see is a trend in Scottsdale.  If you are going to play rock, stick with rock.  If you are going to play hip hop, stick with it.  I don't want to hear some lame dude's Ipod on shuffle.  Sure there will be a few good songs interspersed, but come up with a cohesive playlist!!  The place is a nice place to grab a drink outside, and enjoy their late night menu (which is the same as their happy hour menu, with a selection of appetizers for $5).  When my group left at around 12:30 AM, the place was 90% empty, so I would say it is a decent place to start off a night, but definitely not a place you need to run to.",

The margarita was very mediocre. I like the thin chips they serve (extra charge) but the salsa had weird flavor.  While we waited for our food to arrive, we had two different food runners try to serve us someone else's order. Many times we watched as food runners seemed lost and didn't know where to deliver the food. Then our food arrived after a bit of a wait but we weren't in a hurry.  My fish taco did not taste fresh and I was worried it might make me sick because it was so fishy tasting.   The Fajitas were BORING with no seasoning on the meat, weird black eyed beans that were undercooked and hard.  The most offensive was the rice ball that they served. Literally it was so over cooked, you could stick a fork in it and pick up the whole serving as a lump. It was like Japanese sticky rice.  This place has great potential if they get a decent cook. To be this close to the border and NOT have excellent Mexican food is really disappointing.",

She made no effort to \"sell\" us on anything and no real personal touch to the service. A real disappointment. The food was excellent. We had queso fundido and fajitas. No complaints there.

    "text": "I wanted to like this place. I've driven by it several times and it always looks like fun - the patio fronting Scottsdale Road is often packed.  After a wedding last night (May 11) we decided to stop in for some chips and margaritas. We got there about 9:00 pm - there was a decent crowd but plenty of empty tables both inside and out. Unfortunately what wasn't there was a hostess. Yes, that's right. While you are supposed to have a hostess seat you (as several signs indicate) there was no hostess. This meant the servers had to pull away from their customers to get people assigned and escorted to tables.  Maybe I expect too much but when I sit down at a Mexican restaurant I expect the server to arrive take my drink order with chips and salsa in hand. Not here. You have to ask, they aren't complimentary, and in our case we had to ask four times. The chips and salsa are pretty good but this place needs to up its game on service.  The margaritas were not very good and definitely not worth full price. Maybe at happy hour there is some value.",

The old Salty's was amazing, one of the few places in old town I could enjoy because it wasn't full of rich yuppy's and the prices were actually decent and not over priced. They got rid of the best part of this place which was the extensive drink menu with all the amazing flavors of frozen margaritas. Not to mention one margarita was strong enough for me.   Their food also isn't as great as it was, the nachos are now mad with Queso cheese dip instead of cheddar which makes them horrible in my opinion.  This place is just not the same as it was, I really wish they wouldn't have changed the location or how it was set up because it was really one of my favorite places to drink and go to in old town.",

Party of 6, and we are ready to enjoy our Sunday with great friends, enjoy some drinks and food.  We waited 30 mins for our first round of drinks. We waited an hour and a half for our food. I requested a glass with my beer and did not receive it. Our food came out wrong. Multiple food runners came coming to our table asking if we ordered this or that. The balding tall ( he thinks hes really buff) blonde manager came by- he had quite the attitude !  We mentioned how horrible the service was and how we didn't really care for the taco presentation( 1 guest has a handicap & passing tacos out of the taco holder was not easy ) - his reply was \"Don't you know how to pass a taco\" This guy sucks and needs to go back to planet fitness and work on his muscles, because he does not help any servers doing anything. Service staff needs bar rescue!  Beer tub/champagne and orange girls had no line- so we decided to grab a drink from them, they need to be taught how to serve drinks- it was like a 8 year handing me a glass of lemonade from a lemonade stand.     Looks like the owners got kinda lazy setting up the place too- back patio had a bunch of trash-  you guys will not survive after spring training!!! STEP UP YOUR GAME !",

    "text": "I want to start by saying, the atmosphere at this place was amazing. They had a really cool indoor/outdoor bar that I could see myself sitting at on a nice night and having a few drinks.   On this visit we sat inside at a high top table with a party of 5. We came here for our taco Tuesday tradition. They had two dollar tacos and some drink specials. Our server started out very attentive, but it seemed to decrease as the time passed. A couple times she had a little girl following her around that might have been her kid or something. She would periodically sit down at a table with what looked like grandma, and then start following our server around from table to table. It was definitely distracting her, and when she would check up on us we would be on the middle of a request and she would have to stop to address the little girls question. So that kind of rubbed me the wrong way. I was definitely happy when her shift was up and we got a new server who was much more focused.   We ordered chips and salsa for the table, and all 5 of us ordered tacos, as per tradition. I didn't mind the salsa but the general consensus for the table was negative. The only tacos available for the special were chicken and steak. Both meats are cooked in a sauce and served on a soft flour tortilla with pico de gallo and cheese. We ordered a total of twelve tacos, and when they arrived we were missing a few and our plates were all mixed up. Not a big deal, but it was another server error. The steak was good, but the chicken was delicious. The sauce on it was kind of cheesy, and it had sort of a spicy kick. The tacos were stuffed full, which I love sense it was such a good value. Overall I enjoyed my meal.  I gave three stars mostly because of the service. However it won't stop me from returning. I would definitely recommend this place on a nice night for some drinks on the outside bar.",

The carnitas were like jerky, and the coca-cola shredded beef tamale was an unsuccessful attempt at reinvention: the meat was fine, but it was sitting on a plank of deep fried masa that was as dense and tasteless as dried out play-dough. The molten lava cake was anything but--also very dry--but at least it was warm and the ice cream had magic shell on it. Nice throwback. Also, the patio has portable AC, which adds a star for comfort. Glad we had a Groupon. Go for drinks if you're in the area, sit by the AC on the patio and enjoy the standard chips and salsa, and the sights and sounds of Old Town.",

We hadn't planned on that taking an hour and a half so that was really unfortunate.  When we came in we decided to sit at a booth because it was pretty chilly out.  It wasn't too busy, but we only counted 3 servers.  I think that was what caused the majority of our problems...  It took our waitress like 10 minutes before she came over to greet us with our bottle of water and glasses.  Because it took a while for her to came over we ordered drinks and chips and salsa.  Drinks took another 15 minutes so by the time they came we had already finished with our chips and were so hungry we almost ate the paper.    Two of our friends ordered the tacos which they said were decent.  I ordered the tinga burrito bowl.  Luckily the meat was good because the black eyed peas were an awkward addition and the rice was hard.  My other friend ordered the nachos (with no meat) which also had the strange black eyed peas and some cheese sprinkled on them.  So unfortunate the food was a flop. Bland.  She didn't come back to check on us very often and we noticed two other tables complaining from the same issue, different server.  Seems like they were understaffed and it impacted the service in a BAD way.    It's unfortunate we didn't like it here because we were excited about the new location and the cool new look.  We left saying we wouldn't come back.  Hopefully after a while of being back up and running they will get things going a bit better, I'm not opposed to giving it another shot.",

My Aunt and I split a margarita flight and opted for the frozen drinks.. came with prickly pear, mango and strawberry. All were on the sweet side but super tasty and VERY strong... we would have been falling off our stools if we each had a flight. I mixed the mango and prickly pear and it was muy bueno! The bad - they bring out a big bottle of water... it had stuff floating in it, we let the waitress know and she brings another.. stuff floating in this one as well. Our guess was the dishwasher was not getting all the stuff out which is pretty yuck... especially since we had already started drinking the water before noticing.",

I thought their fried pita chips with cilantro hummus was a cool twist and I couldn't get enough. Tableside guac was so good we scraped the bowl and my boyfriend went to town on the fundido with chorizo. The margarita she recommended was so refreshing and definitely left me 'floating' as promised. I cant remember the name but it was something made with don julio silver and lavender infusions, an unlikely but delicious pairing.

    "text": "Overall a great place for fun with friends.  Food: I had the taco chopped salad and it was delicious! There was not a long wait for it either. Very pleased.  Service: Alex was my waitress. She is a fantastic waitress, friendly, and knows what she is doing!  Venue: I loved the set up! The patio is amazing! Sit outside and enjoy the great weather with some fine tequila.   The reason for not having 5 stars: A slight mix up with my tequila order, BUT I spoke up and expressed my concerns. It not only was it addressed quickly and taken care of by the house, but the manager, Matt, came out and personally served us the best tequila they had to make up for the mix up.   Very happy with this place! And I recommend giving it a go!",

There are soooo many tools at this place who think that they are \"all that\".  I would never go here on a crowded weekend night.  Also, the only have bottled beer that is expensive.  I am a beer snob and the bottle is not the way to go, for me at least.  Ron B says it best, this is a college bar disguised as a restaurant.  Oh, they have lots of smokers on the patio, the chairs are not comfy and the tables are nasty.",

    "text": "My spouse and I had brunch at this popular Scottsdale eatery. We were very quickly greeted and seated in the outside patio by a friendly hostess. The decor is faux Mexican coastal cantina and  the clientele appeared to be young professionals. during our visit..  Our very perky server, Rachael,  quickly brought menus and offered  appetizers and beverages. We had draft Victoria and Pacifico beers, followed by  an assemble it yourself omelet for my wife and a large steak burrito for myself. The burrito was accompanied by browned, cubed potatos and onion, the omelet by fresh fruit. The food was carefully prepared, in large portions and nicely presented. Music was eclectic, and a bit loud, but not really obtrusive,  We split an order of sopapillas for dessert and still had to take three home, along with part of the omelet.  The outside seating was comfortable, and canine friendly with a couple of the furry guys present. Traffic on Scottsdale Rd is very close, but their is enough setback to minimize it's bothersomeness.  I would recommend this place for tourists and locals.  The place was full and everyone on the patio was contributing to a good vibe. The menu is apparently more limited during the week, so try Sunday brunch.",

I had the pork street tacos and they were good. I give them a 4 out of 5  Service is ok but theres always good looking people working.  They make a ton of margs but I've only tried the standard. They have a full bar but its mostly Tequila. Good selection, my favorite was Cruz Tequila. The bartender recomended it and knew quite a bit about all the other tequilas.  I would go back again for drinks and chips and salsa\"  The thing that differs with this location from the north one is that the service was better and we loved the atmosphere of the outdoor patio. I would recommend this location more",

And the taquitos? What? Squeeze me? Two taquitos, cut in half, made to look like four. Who's your chef? Vern Troyer? They were the size of my middle toe. I kid you not. I won't go on about the Scottsdale crowd that frequents the Salty. Really I won't. Block head dudes with Ed Hardy T shirts and Michael Kors tans. And the babes. The chicks. Boobies SO big, after a few of those rank ritas, I had this image of all of them exploding at the same time, with chards of silicon splattering everywhere.

Apparently the meat was so tasteless that they felt the need to bury it in a spice mixture that tasted only of cumin. Even had to Ask for chips and salsa. The Happy Hour menu was sad. All in all, no plans on returning anytime soon. Good thing the owners have the unknowing Spring Training folks to look forward to. If you're local, don't waste you time here",

Mexican bento is the greatest idea I have seen in awhile. The food was fresh and fast.  Open air concept does attract the flies, with all the sweet liquor bottles and fragrant foods.  We enjoyed a nice lunch, few drinks and moved on to the local shops nearby.  Great location. I can see why Salty Senorita is so popular. This could definitely be a place I would like to hang out if we lived in AZ again.    Waitress brought my husband a birthday dessert with a candle.",

With so many new options in old town that actually provide some level of competent service (including RnR across the street), it doesn't even make sense.   Yesterday, my party and I were seated after a 15 minute wait (not bad for a spring training afternoon) but the service was just terrible on so many levels. We started with two orders of the bacon guacamole which the waiter said would \"be right out\"'after a 20 minute wait. They turned out to take 20 more minutes. When we finally placed our food orders and 45 minutes had passed, the waiter came to ask us how we'd like to split the check BEFORE we even had the food on our table. Truly egregious. We had an outdoor table and it was kind of ironic to look across the street and wonder how much better the meal would have been at RnR. Again, the waiter and restaurant had clearly failed any measurable service standard and instead of trying to make amends, he simply tried to accelerate shuffling us out of the restaurant. Unacceptable way to treat long time customers.   The food did eventually show up and as always, the tacos did impress. Salty's still does a great job with the food. So my advice: if you want great Mexican food with terrible service, Salty's is your spot. But if you want decent food with some actual service--there's 30 other options in old town alone. Bring back the old Salty's atmosphere!",

Misters are very useful when the temp is around 100. However, it was evening and in the 80s when we showed. We moved to a dry table on our own after ordering. We waited quite a while and finally flagged someone down to ask for chips and salsa. These ended up being very good.   I ordered enchiladas and one friend ordered sliders and the other a burrito. We were all happy with our meals but the service was horrible AND we got charged for chips and salsa. Who does that? This may be a decent place to get a drink but I would never go back.",

Maybe I have the mind of a 14-year-old boy and the drink names make me giggle, but I've never had a bad experience at Salty Senorita.  Now I always start with the Senorita Chop Salad because that is one tasty combination with chicken, mango, avocado, cucumber, romaine, and whatever other fresh delicious items they add.    I also enjoy the tableside guac and an assortment of tacos, of which the carnitas and shrimp are my favorites.  Go.  Make sure your loved one drinks the El Diablo and you'll have one hell of a weekend.  Oh yeah.  Review #100, mis amigos.",

I've ventured over to Salty's on several occasions having been turned away by the ridiculously long wait time at RnR. It's generally been a Sunday morning, accompanied by a handful of folks, each with day-drinking and breakfast on the mind. Salty's satisfies the first need, but I've been disappointed by the breakfast. Each time, the potatoes have been cold (I wouldn't mind zapping them for an extra 45 seconds in the microwave), and the rest has been mediocre. My friends have liked their other entrees, but never really impressed.  The good news is you can get great chips and table side guacamole. It's a larger portion than their regular guac with more options for add-ins and flavor. The Bloody Mary bar catches my eye every time. I like to pile in all sorts of spicy veggies and top it off with some organic Bloody Mary mix. Breakfast of champs!  The bottom line: Check out Salty's as a decent alternative to the busier bars nearby. It boasts a pretty great patio and all the drinks, snacks and ambiance to kick off your dia de beber!",

My fiance's daughter requested no beans with her steak fajitas and was still brought beans. Again, not a biggie. The food was decent. I ordered the rotisserie chicken tacos. Not the best tacos but not the worst tacos. There was a chipotle sauce on them that had a weird flavor. I also had a pineapple margarita which was delicious. Now when trouble started is when we got home several hours later. I had the WORST stomach ache. I went to lay down and just chalked it up as maybe I ate too much. About an hour after that I felt this intense we urge to throw up. I barely made it to the bathroom before throwing up. A couple hours later the remainder of the meal came up. My fiance's feels fine who had the exact same meal minus the margarita so I didn't attribute it to the food until I talked to his daughter who also threw up ALL night. I will never return and advise others to steer clear of this place!",

    "text": "In all fairness to the SS people, I was on the fence between a 2 and a 3 star rating. Went with the 2 because it doesn't sound like we are the only people with a bad experience.  After a super fun experience getting our NOH8 photos taken at the theatre down the street we were hungry. The Salty Senorita was close so we walked over. Got seated right away. The Hostess came back and gave us water and took our drink order and we ordered tableside Guacamole at the same time.  The tableside Guac came and it was the Hostess preparing it. I'm not sure if she only did the tableside prep or also pulled the ingredients in the kitchen, but the Guacamole was the worst I'd ever had - the amount of salt in it was enough to have killed a sidewalk of snails. The waitress came to the table and we told her and she offered to go make a fresh one. That came out and it was perfect.  I can't remember exactly when we ordered our lunch tacos, but we got there about 1:15, at 2:10'ish the manager came to apologize and said that he was going to take care of us.   Finally our tacos came out. Mine were room temperature, I swear a couple of pieces of steak were almost cold, even (but that may have been me hungry and pissed off). They were sitting on the counter waiting to be delivered for so long that the tortilla shells were sticking to the metal serving tray-we had to use a fork to pry them off.  Honestly, I really think that they would have been good had they been warm.  The waitress came back quite a few times to check on us and apologize. She was great about filling our sodas for us. The manager took care of our bill, all of it (which is why I was on the fence about putting down a 3 for my rating). The waitress also gave us two free appetizers, \"in case you will come back\". She didn't really phrase it the best way, but I can't blame here.  Seating - we didn't go inside, so I don't know anything about the interior. We sat outside because it was a beautiful day. The umbrellas in the tables were not secured. There were a few wind gusts that caused us to grab at our umbrellas. In looking around, everyone felt the need to grab at their umbrellas. There was one table that the umbrella completely blew up and out - quick reaction from the diners kept it from hitting any of the neighboring diners. This seems like another quirk they probably should work out.  Will we go back? I'm sure we will. The food really seemed like it was going to be good - the ingredients all looked like they were there.",

Our server was very quick and on the ball with a total of 9 people, all of which required separate bills.    Not on the menu is the $2 bottomless chips and salsa...ask for it and they still offer it!  Woohoo!  Gone are the buckets o' beer...quite a shame, but Coors / Coors Light are $2 on happy hour.    The ladies restroom, curiously, was in very poor shape.  One toilet was leaking all over the floor.  Two (of 4) stalls didn't have the door locking mechanism.  How is this OK or possible for a new place?  Will I be back?  YES. I love a good patio and bottomless chips and salsa and friendly service is enough to get me back.  Was the old Salty's better?  YES...",

    "text": "We have been there twice; decent food, good queso, no complaints about service (but not amazing). However, my boyfriend and I are both college students and we had a late night 10/21, so we called ahead to make sure they would be open when we came in for dinner. Key phrase: WE CALLED AHEAD!!! The woman on the other line said the kitchen was open until 11:00PM on Thursdays. So we drove from Tempe to Old Town; arriving at Salty Senorita at 10:45PM.  We waited at the host desk for 2 minutes waiting for someone to come by and greet us... Reminder: it's 10:45PM, 15 minutes before they close. NO ONE was around. The bartender, the servers, NO ONE. Okay, y'all are trying to close. I get it. We just want to eat really quick and get out of there. So we walk around and found three servers around the computer station putting in tips. We ask if we can put in some food. The waitress' answer, \"Oh, we did last call 10 minutes ago.\"   My boyfriend and I have both worked in the restaurant industry. We both are very aware of how restaurants work. I smiled and told her we called ahead. She continued to persist that they did last call 10 minutes ago.  So, my boyfriend and I left the restaurant. We both looked at each other half astonished and half excited to make a bad Yelp review. We agreed that if the general manager was there, and if we had asked him/her if we were able to put in food, the general manager would have been absolutely accommodating (well, hopefully, if the GM is worth anything!). We are not the disrespectful guests that will sit there and eat for another hour after you close. We were simply students that would have left you a nice tip after you served us food 15 minutes before you closed. We get it, it was late- but the rudeness of the servers was astonishing and we will NOT be returning. And we will certainly be making our friends aware of the blatant disregard for their guests.",

The ambiance was great and the service was very friendly. They also have an extensive patio and outdoor area that looked nice, but it was 110 so we didn't venture outside. I also really loved the decor, really cool looking light fixtures.  The reason I am only giving 4 stars is the drinks. The water they served us had this salty or metallic taste-yuck. The margaritas we ordered were so weak they tasted like a 7-11 slurpie and the pitcher didn't even full 5 drinks.",

I can't remember exactly what the old location was like, and although the upgrade is much nicer aesthetically, there's something about the \"feel\" of it that's similar (especially to how it fits in Old Town). Salty has more of a straight restaurant vibe to it (not the type of place your gonna hang out at REAL late), but it has a bit of a \"hipper\" feel to it now so there's no need to rush off to other places after you're done eating. You can stay for a few more drinks.  That being said, I came here with a group of friends on a Saturday (late) morning when we were waiting for a table across the street at RnR since we needed SOMETHING in our systems stat and this place was empty.   The patio is nice. The bartender was nice. my mimosa (served in a margarita glass) was just fine. I even ordered a steak taco because I needed to eat something before the extremely long wait for breakfast across the street, and it was fine.   It was hard to get a real feel for the new Salty Senorita when it was empty on a Saturday morning, but after checking it out I'd be inclined to stop in again (maybe for HH). However, it's still not a place that would immediately stand out when I was thinking of a bar and/or restaurant to hang out at in Old Town.",

Not only does Ben make excellent Margs but his attitude and service is the best .hey Saltys .... Keep Ben around !   If you haven't checked out Saltys on Tuesday you should...the Margs are great, theres a FREE raffle to win prizes, and tacos are on way better than that loco place down the way.  Oh and DJ Steele is best in town.   Go see Ben for some Margs oh and order some tacos!",

We sat at our table for 10 minutes until our server, Katherine G, finally greeted us. She was very short with us and not friendly. For most of our visit she was nowhere to be found. This made it difficult for us to enjoy our time there. The restaurant was not busy, so it seemed like there was really no excuse.  We had to keep waiting to order our next round of drinks and when we tried to order food she walked away from the table. Making us wait again to get our order in.  The drinks and food were both great, but the service really affected our visit and experience. Such a bummer! Also had to pay for chips/salsa which was pretty weird to us...never been to a Mexican restaurant where they were not offered automatically.",

    "text": "With all the restaurants available in the Scottsdale area, I'm not sure how we decided on this one. I guess somebody wanted tacos and we all agreed.   My friend went wedding dress shopping today and we decided we were hungry and ready for a bite. Today has proven to me that it is no longer patio season in Phoenix. Boy is it hot outside. They originally wanted to seat us at a table in the sun but we decided to squeeze at a smaller table in the shade.   The server gets 1 star. It's not like we had a huge group - there were 5 of us. I ordered a mimosa and the others had margaritas and beer. My mimosa didn't show up until the rest of the group was ready for a second round of drinks. I also had to point it out to our server when she finally came around to check on us.   When I finally got my mimosa, there was a black speck in it and the orange slice that was there for decor had some on it too. Maybe they had something burnt next to the orange slices...? I didn't make a stink about it and drank it but definitely didn't order another one because who knows what else I will find in the next one. And that's if the server doesn't forget I ordered one.   Food - I would give them 2 and a half stars. I ordered 2 fish tacos and one braised short rib taco. The cook was a little heavy handed with the seasoning for the fish tacos. The short rib taco was just blah but I ate it anyway because I was hungry and it's really only 3 bites since they are small tacos.   When our food arrived to the table, I asked for some napkins since we didn't have any at our table. The person who dropped off our food never came back with any so I got up and rounded up some silverware and napkins from 2 other tables.   Usually, I would round up on my rating if I was in between two ratings but because of the service we received, our experience deserves two stars. If you are craving tacos, go elsewhere. They have $20 bottomless mimosas here but you won't get your money's worth unless you plan on spending all day here.",

The place wasn't very busy yet for the lunch crowd and it still took some time to get seated. The staff seemed to be scrambling. Once we got seated it took a while to get our orders taken. We were mostly just stopping in for a couple drinks, no food. Two of us had the Salty Senorita and one ordered a different drink. The SM's were ok, nothing special even a little too bitter. The other drink was supposed to have some grapefruit slices in it. When it came it looked like 7-Up. We asked the waitress and she brought over the fruit to put in it.   Waitress disappeared for a long time. Got another drink. Then the check and left. She was friendly though.  I was really looking forward to this place and was let down. Too many good places in Scottsdale to deal with this. I may give it another try next time I'm back but who knows.",

Once we were seated though, thing's went downhill - fast. Our waitress (Carolann H) was incredibly rude, and not attentive at all. The place was not busy, so we were not sure what was taking so long. We waited roughly 20 minutes for a beer, which was room temperature by the time she brought it to us. It took another 30 minutes for us to receive the fish tacos we had ordered on the recommendation of our waitress. The flavor was good, but there was hardly any fish at all, but instead packed with cabbage and sauce. We tried to talk to our waitress about it, but she was busy running around trying to give other waitresses free food that was mistakenly cooked, and kept walking past us while we attempted to get her attention. Finally, we had to reach out to a fellow waitress to ask her for our checks, and cancel a secondary order we had placed for additional pitchers of beer because of how long it was taking. Finally, Carolann came. She proceeded to get into an aggressive argument with one of my friends, and was not accommodating at all. I wish she would have tried to remedy the situation because my friends and I are always looking for good places to recommend and go to often.",

Not up to the usual standard that we fell in love with.  Went back this month (April) twice,  in hopes that they had worked out the kinks.  And they did.  From what I understand, new manager from when they first reopened and things were running much smoother.  Food was back to its yummy standard as well .  Love,  love,  love the pork tacos.

I perused the menu again and settled on a chicken burrito - wet - with green sauce.  7 minutes later the stale chips arrived, along with an apology from the nice manager about not having the pork and seafood items.  Truck issues.  It happens.  The huge burrito was mediocre, huge chunks of flavor-free chicken, but lots of spicy green sauce inside and out.

The margarita menu is exhaustive, but again, very expensive.  Some are upwards of $12 for an average sized glass.  We ordered a pitcher of the basic marg, which was $26.  And to cut costs a bit, my date and I shared the 6 taco plate, choosing 2 for me and the other 4 for him.  They were, however, accommodating of my vegetarian diet, making me bean tacos (and the black and refried beans are both veg-friendly).  We might be back for happy hour, but probably not for a full meal.  You can get fairly tasty, greasy Mexican food elsewhere for a lot cheaper.",

My original server was not attentive never grabbed us water or silverware. I am also in the service industry. She informed us she charged a customer the wrong bill and never returned. Then, we saw Lauren she was on top of all her tables and on top of it was a team player with her coworkers! Not only did she grab our appetizer but we begged her to be our server. From there our experience went from 1-10! We got drinks our food came out perfect and everything was smooth sailing. However, the server we originally had got double sat failed to greet both of them lost a five top to another server that was on the opposite of the restaurant and left and elderly couple of two to have a terrible experience as well. But she proceeded to take care of two men right next to us that had already ate, drink,and paid. The manager was exceptional too she was busting her butt hosting food running and cleaning off tables! I bet if this place weeded out some of the weak links they would be an all star restaurant!",

Many of us did not even recognize the menu.  Who puts cucumbers in tacos? Who deep fries a tamale? And NO enchiladas?   Several of us ordered the steak fajitas because it was close to what we were used to.  Now understand we were from CA, TX, ID, GA, IL, MO, FL and WI.  And we all agreed that the food was seriously bland.  The steak, though tender had not flavor at all.  And the onions and peppers served w/the fajitas were soggy.  The margaritas were bland as well. So I switched to domestic beer.   Lastly, we were eating inside and it was extremely warm.  The bathrooms were cooler than the dining area.  Kudos for the tomatillo salsa.  Follow that lead with seasoning and MAYBE you have something.",

The service is great though sometimes it seems that an extra server would be prudent, and though the patio is nice and heat is provided, there are a few, small metal \"things\" that stick up here and there that servers and customers could trip over. The food is delicious and the drinks generous, especially during happy hour. I would recommend it as a casual place to grab a bite or quench your thirst. Parking can be challenging as the parking lot for Salty's is down the block, while the next door neighbor, Buca di Beppo lays claim to some primo parking real estate.",

We both ordered tacos and they were good. Not the best in the world but good.  I think my favorite dish there was the chips and guacamole. Excellent and made at the table!

Only my friend was seated at the table - I was in the bathroom and my husband and my friend's boyfriend were outside, so out waitress only brought one water glass. When she saw the rest of our party she said she would bring more water glasses but I guess she forgot.  I had a bloody mary, which was a little spicy and pretty good. My friend had a couple different margaritas, each which she thought were fine. She was able to get one for only $1 after checking in at Salty Senorita on foursquare. My husband and friend's boyfriend had beer; the beer selection was pretty limited so if you don't like Negro Modelo I would stick to a cocktail or wine.  I thought the salsa was good, and the chips were fresh and crispy. The guacamole was extremely salty. It was edible, but seriously salty. After passing the one water glass around the table a few times, we flagged down our server for the bill and left.  I don't think I would go back, but we had a nice time despite the poor service and food. If you have some serious time on your hands and like salt, you might like Salty Senorita.",

That new menu of yours is terrible, there's barely anything on it worth ordering. We ordered the happy hour nachos, there was a puddle of water at the bottom of the plate, maybe from watery salsa? who knows but it was weird and they only tasted okay. How can it be that your only quesadilla on the menu is veggie? Why are your tacos made in child size and cost $3 each? Why, why why oh why ever change?!  Please, do us all a favor and have re-re-opening party with the old menu back and celebrating all of the good old cheap awesome Mexican food and margaritas that we all loved.

You can't beat the HH drink price either, especially with the ambiance that goes with it: My version of a 2 for 1. Great prices all while enjoying the entertainment Scottsdale Rd. has to offer. On this occasion, Ben was particularly charming and quite frankly, just good at his job. Which why, here I am, feeling compelled to write a review.   Stay classy Salty's, because lord knows I'm not.",

    "text": "The food/drinks were fine; I did not have any issues about that. The service was great. The reason I am rating this restaurant so low is because of their inaccessibility for individuals with disabilities. I went to use the restroom during our meal and while I was in there an elderly woman in wheelchair came in to use the restroom. There were four small stalls in the restroom and not one of them was large enough for a wheelchair to fit; the first stall was the largest but did not have grab bars (?!). The other smaller stalls did not have grab bars either. Me and another stranger had to help the woman to stand outside the stall, arrange the seat paper, help her in and hold the stall door closed. Wait for her to finish and help her walk back to her wheelchair because, no grab bars. Needless to say, she was extremely embarrassed and none of us could understand how the restrooms could not accommodate individuals in wheelchairs. She mentioned on multiple occasions how close she was to 'wetting herself'. After helping her I found the manager who quickly told me that they have a separate 'handicap' restroom and pointed to a red door in the restaurant. The door is not labeled, it's simply a plain red door with no signage. I commented to her that the door should have insignia or something to indicate what it is. She replied that they don't put a sign on the door so other 'non-handicapped' patrons don't use it. She said they usually tell people who are in wheelchairs where this 'special' bathroom is. She further commented that she was unaware that a woman in a wheelchair was there or she would have told her where the bathroom is.    There are so many issues with this situation that I cannot possibly cover all of them but... first, don't ever assume that you can visually identify EVERY single person that might need an accessible restroom. That is discrimination at its worst. Restrooms, especially accessible ones, should be clearly identified. Secondly, everyone should have access to a restroom without embarrassment or issue. This woman should not have been put in this situation as a patron of this establishment. In this day and age!? Get it together.",

My husband had never experienced Southwestern culture before, so I was excited to explore with him.  We had discussed looking for a Mexican restaurant in Old Town where we could enjoy a margarita.  We saw the Salty Senorita from across the street, it looked cute and fun.  The bar and restaurant are creatively decorated, very bright and festive.  We were warmly greeted at the bar by a friendly young male bartender.  He even made the attempt to remember our names.  We happily learned that we had arrived during happy hour and there were $4 margaritas available!  Bonus!  Our drinks were quite tasty and just the right strength.  We had a late lunch at another establishment, so we didn't get a chance to try the food.  I love the name of this place, very creative!",

We started by getting a table inside, and besides the college-bar blaring music, it was Free Manicure Day. I am not making this up. We sat at a table for 5, and to my left was a woman giving manicures in a booth. Hello? Health Department? So it was too noisy for my wife's Dad because of his hearing aid. It was too noisy for me too, as I am 20+ years out of college, and need to hear myself think before I speak.   We got a table outside with bar stool height seats, which was cool. Freezing to be polite. There were propane tree heaters, which worked for the people near them, but I was not one of those. Happy hour, $3 for Corona, $4 for Margaritas. My wife decides to get top shelf Margaritas. They go for $9 each. Nothing happy about  that.   Chips and salsa. Best part of the evening, which is a bad sign. The chips were the thinnest I have ever seen, crispy, salty and warm. Salsa was smoked style, medium-hot spicy and very good. But after eating all the chips you can stand, you got to get some real food, right?   I ordered the 'dos' items, as in uno, dos, tres, from the menu. Chicken taco and chicken enchilada. Beans and rice go with. This stuff would make a Mexican turn in his green card and walk home in shame. Totally no taste, no life just filling. Opposite of a Bud Light, [does not] taste great [is not] less filling. The other diners at my table were equally uninspired by their food,   Wait staff was OK. And I second Tiffany B.'s opinion on the eye candy of Scottsdale fake boobs. Seems this is where all the Hooters waitresses come to party. Or Hooters waitress candidates.",

    "text": "OK, so Salty Senorita won't win any \"Best Of\" awards.  I don't think this place is Zagat rated, and I am almost positive they're light years away from winning a Michelin star.  Yet, we keep coming back here, year after year.  This place is so much fun that for a brief moment I actually considered buying a commemorative t-shirt.  Salty Senorita is a can't-miss stop on our annual Arizona tour.  Every time I set foot in this place, I think \"spring break for adults.\"  Laugh if you want, but before you know it, you too will reach that age when you realize you're too old to hang out with the sophomores at Daytona Beach.  Actually, the realization comes only when said sophomores TELL you that you're too old to hang out with them.  Never fear: Salty Senorita to the rescue.  Decorated like a surf bar with a nice patio, Salty Senorita offers cold beer, margaritas and below-average Mexican food at reasonable prices.  The restaurant's motto: \"If the food and drinks are not up to your standards, please lower your standards\" is posted right on the wall to avoid any confusion.  While the food quality will make you long for Chevy's, the people watching will keep you coming back.  The place gets really crowded, especially right after the baseball game lets out.  You will be hard pressed to find a table on the patio, but the inside dining room is cooler and roomier.  The service gets spotty at times, as the restaurant seems to be understaffed during their busy times.    I do love the laid back atmosphere here, though.  Last time we asked the waiter if he could put on the baseball game on TV, and he gave us the remote control instead.  He said something along the lines of \"go crazy and change the channel to whatever you want.\"  How cool is that?  I felt like I was at home, having some chips and salsa and relaxing with a remote in my hands.  I was thinking of changing the channel to Home Shopping Network and waiting to see how long it would take someone to notice that we've been watching \"Tribute to Terrific Turquoise.\"   I know I am coming back next year.  Why not?  I know that the fajita I had here wasn't the worst I've ever had, and the unlimited tortilla chips are great for throwing at your friends if they get out of line.",

When our drinks finally got there we went ahead and put in our order for food, I ordered ceviche and my friends ordered tacos. 20 minutes passed by and I saw our server frequently check on the table across from us, never came to check on us. Another 10 minutes past same thing, finally an hour passes by and I went over to her to cancel our order. The manger came with our food, actually everyone's food except for mine...and told us he comped our food. Needless to say I will not be coming back here nor recommending it to my guest. Only reason they get a star is because I like the new location. Hopefully others have better experiences but from the other comments I see, they need a few months of customer service training for sure.",

Yea, Salty's has a nice outdoor patio with tables and heaters during the winter time, but I go to Mexican restaurants for the food.  The food here is decent. Servers will make the guacamole for you right at your table and I enjoyed their carne asada burrito. This place is overpriced though. Can't speak for the Mesa location, but I think you pay for atmosphere...or the location.  Parking here is also pretty poor as it's located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. I've been here on a Thursday night and Sunday night and thought it was far more comfortable to spend time there than on weekends.   Salty has a busy happy hour crowd. I don't recommend going for dinner on a weekend night because it's just too packed. Plus, as I mentioned, food is a bit pricey.",

We waited at total of an hour and a half for service at the bar and the table, we actually never got service at the table for 20 minutes. That's when we decided to leave. We payed for bottomless mimosas and only got 2 for the hour and a half we were there. Matt took care of our tab, not expected but super appreciated. Thank you for making us actually want to come back just based on integrity of your restaurant. Much appreciated. They were also very under staffed and we get that so thank you for trying guys!",

My friends and I trotted over there after enjoying a few beers at a Giants spring training game. I think it's fair to say that about 500 other people had the very same idea!! I loved the fun atmosphere but it took about 15 minutes of waving a $20 bill to get the bartenders attention. It seems like they should schedule a few more people on game days in order to meet the demand at the bar.  On a positive note, the margarita was mixed well, and had just enough tequila to get the job done!  This is a fun place to go with a group of friends but I'd say get there early if you want to try to get a table on the patio or even a place at the bar. If you're hungry, you may want to stop somewhere else first on a weekend afternoon!",

The ambience is that of any open air sports bar, which isn't a complaint. I was actually surprised it wasn't more raucous. After looking over the menu I'd wished we'd gone for happy hour when the prices are much cheaper, but the total bill was still under $40 which is awesome considering all the drinks and food we got. I ordered the Chipotle Chicken burrito and my hubby had the Carne Asada burrito. Mine was delicious and spicy and I liked the Carne but my husband didn't so I had to drop a star. There was an awful lot of rice in his. My burrito was hot and spicy. I hate bland Mexican food. I was pleased but the place is far from perfect. They didn't ask us which sides we wanted. They just brought beans which didn't really bother me because that's what I would've ordered anyway. They had a good beer special, though. I'd definitely go back for a happy hour. I might have to find someone else to go with me.",

    "text": "This is by far the best place for day drinking out on a patio in my mind (and a great place for people watching as well).  First off, they have the best salsa to go along with the chips they bring you as soon as you sit down.  Secondly, and normally I'm a beer guy, but the Undertow Margarita, which has a float of Jack Daniel's on it, is to die for.  Their shredded beef tacos also make the trip worth it.  Each night they seem to have some sort of special to go along with their regular happy hour.  My favorite is Tuesday, with dollar tacos and $5 bucket of Coronitas (Corona's in smaller bottles).  They also have a very solid Sunday brunch, perfect for nursing yourself back to life after a long night out on Saturday.  All the servers that I've come across here (and I've been here a lot) always are very nice, super attentive, and friendly as can be.  As I mentioned, sitting outside on the patio is entertainment in itself, as you can people watch those at Salty's and check out those walking next door to Oregano's and watch all the bikers roll into the Billet Bar as well.  If Old Town isn't your area, try checking out the Salty's in Mesa off of Stapley and the 60 (much larger patio), in North Scottsdale by the airpark, and out on the West Side by the Peoria Sports Complex.",

We ordered drinks and saw them sitting at the bar for about 5 minutes before the waitress showed up from being AWOL and deliverred them.  The menu is pretty limited - tacos several different ways, with burritos and bowls and a few appetizers.  We started with chips and salsa, then ordered the guacamole, which was pretty good and the highlight of the evening.  That followed by a couple different tacos and a burrito bowl.  The tacos were OK, and the bowl was way too salty.  Almost inedible.  I guess if you're drinking heavily, you wouldn't notice.  Go for the patio and the beer.  That's about it.",

Live music, lots and lots and lots of drink specials.  I think we snacked on some appetizers, and from what I remember, we went through them all at a fast pace - so I'm guessing the food was great.

The fact that I've always liked it is the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1.  Our server would disappear for 30-45 minutes at a time, come back with the wrong order, and disappear again without fixing the order.  I finally had to tell her that we were not pleased, and she tried to tell us she was new.  I am very tolerant of new servers, but this girl spent most of her night chatting with a couple guests that were clearly her friends.  The initial mistakes with our orders weren't a big deal, but failing to fix them and disappearing again while chatting up her friends for over half an hour showed us she really did not care about us, or her tip.  Do yourself a favor if you go there and don't sit in Gretchen's section.  Her failures and subsequent disregard to amend the situation were not a result of being a new server; they were the result of being a rude person.",

We also ordered cocktails and sodas which were served by two different people at two different times. PS - the diablo margarita tasted exactly like robitussin cough syrup. So gross!   We ordered the steak salad and a chicken salad. The steak was over-cooked and too chewy to eat. The chicken salad was decent except that it was purported to have fresh mango in it and i counted exactly 1 piece of mango in my salad. Awesome.

    "text": "3 Stars because the food (street tacos) was actually good. We wanted a fun meal before heading to the airport and instead ended up cutting it close. There were just too many problems with the service.   When we first arrived, we asked for a table on the patio because the weather was so nice. Unfortunately, we got an area that didn't have umbrellas. After asking for one, our waitress came back to tell us they were still ordering more fixtures like umbrellas because they only opened two weeks ago. Seems like something you get a hold on before opening.   Then we proceeded to order and the waitress informed us they were out of some menu items. She only replied with, \"Sorry, the hostess should have told you.\" Well, she didn't.   When the food finally came it was great. The  short rib tacos and maple jalepeno tacos were fantastic.  It took quite a while for the waitress to get back to us during the meal and after for our check. She even mentioned that she didn't even notice we had gotten our food. That was weird. But glad they at least got something right.",

The service is always great, especially this one server I had named Kylee. She was extremely nice and polite and always made sure that we were taken care of.

When he came back to my group, he basically threw my ID at me then asked what I wanted. When I responded to him with a \"thanks for throwing my ID at me\" I got a very rude \"it's your ID that's f***** up not me, i'm just trying to do my job.\" He seemed annoyed that I would be offended by how rude he was.

We came in on a Saturday night and YES it's spring training and YES it's busy but the treatment and the service we got was unacceptable the server was clearly flustered from the beginning. We didn't have enough chairs for the table so we asked for some and she said \"you can find your own\" which we thought she was joking but she wasn't. We had a big party but mostly couples so everyone was going to be splitting checks she never asked if they were split which would be the first thing you should ask with a big party. Then she would put things down and just throw them in front of us like it was an in convince to her.  Which it is her job. Then when the bill came it was not split and it was not clear that it needed to be said to split it. we asked nicely to have her split the bill by telling her exactly what was on each bill. She said that was too much and asked us to calculate the tabs ourselves. Then she pulled the manager over who was just as unhelpful!!! I'm sorry but as someone who has worked in customer service it's completely unfair to just put things on the customer to \"figure out.\" The food was good but the service was so bad that we will NEVER go back.",

The menu is limited and a little pricey for bar food.  Yes, bar food.  This place is a bar that serves some standard Mexican fare, but nothing special.  I had the carne asada taco and fish taco which were around $3 each.  Didn't come with beans or rice.  They were OK.  The cheese dip we ordered was runny... excuse me, the Fundido was runny.  The chicken quesadilla was large and actually better than expected.  Service was weak.  The server (don't recall her name, but it's #648 on the receipt) had a squeaky voice and seemed to be in a hurry even though she wasn't busy.  Happy Hour pricing made the beers reasonable, but I won't be looking to come here again with so many other great options in Scottsdale.  Pros=free parking, fun 80s and 90s videos playing on the TVs Cons=service and quality... I see other Salty Senorita's in the Phoenix area have closed.

We let her know that we had to cancel our food, get the check and get out of there.  She was very apologetic, and came back a minute later to inform us that they were covering the tab for the whole group of 8 people.

    "text": "First, let me state that I probably will never go back to this business.  We went there this past Thursday night for a friend's birthday party.  Granted, we had a table/party of 20+, but right from the start, we had TERRIBLE service.  1 waitress for our table and she would only swing by every 20+ minutes.  Many of us actually had to get up and order our drinks from the bar because we never saw the waitress.  When it finally came time for the bill, the waitress gave us 1 receipt for everyone, a $500+ bill.  She refused to split it up and so it took us a very long time to pass the bill around one-by-one so everyone could figure out what we owed.  After everyone put down our credit cards and actually wrote out what we wanted charged to each card, it took another 10 minutes to get the waitress to pick up the bill.  After another 20 minutes, she finally came back with the cards and to our surprise, she charged the amount we wrote down PLUS 20% on each card.  With out asking.  The whole point of the cards was to split up the bill and allow us to choose our tips (which we had already figured in to the amount).  Example:  I owed $15 in food and drinks, so I wrote down to charge my card $20.  After this obvious error, the waitress was very pissed off about having to run the cards again, something that took another 20 minutes.  I went up to the manager to talk to him and explain the situation and how we all were now waiting over 1 HOUR just to cash out due to his waitress's mistake.  At the least he could do was comp. us a free beer or something.  At this suggestion, the manager (the tall, skinny white guy) got very angry and told us that IT WAS OUR FAULT and that we have been wasting his and his waitress's time and that we should have had 1 person pay for everything.  To top that off, the waitress was pissy about it,.  TL, DR:  terrible service, manager doesn't give a fuck.  Don't give this business your money.",

Came in mid-day to find no hostess and no sign saying to seat ourselves and we ended up standing there for a little over 10 minutes while a bartender 5 yards away stared at us on occasion while talking to a couple people sitting at the counter. Right when a group of people blew passed us and sat down, he asks if we need any help. We mention wanting a table and he answers, \"Yeah, Lexis will help you out with that,\" before returning to his conversation.   Great...   Taking a cue from that other group, we just headed for a booth. Our waitress came out, and we ordered the brownie as well as their margarita cheesecake for contrast.   The brownie vaguely had the taste of rum, while the \"margarita\" cheesecake just tasted like cheesecake, though it tasted better after squeezing a couple lime wedges on top. Between the two, the brownie was better. It was warmed and served with vanilla ice cream.    Took a long time for the check to come, just like in the Mesa location.   I just don't know about this chain. From what I understand, the service is better at this one, but the food is just not worth the prices. I mean, the place has margaritas that run $200 apiece like they're the Five Dollar Shake of Tarantino lore.",

I ordered the street corn and it was not very flavorful. I also had the fish tacos and were okay but didn't blow me away. I had the house margarita which was on the happy hour menu and was pretty happy with that. My friend ordered the chicken fajitas and the chicken was dry and again, not much flavor.",

We were walking around old town looking for an outdoor venue with a happy hour and were not disappointed with our final decision to stop at Salty Senorita.  My wife and I shared the carnitas nachos, a huge platter plenty for two people.  We both had the happy hour margaritas, mine was the regular on the rocks with salt and hers the skinny.  The margaritas had plenty of tequila and tasted great.  We were plenty \"buzzed\" after one.  We will definitely come back for happy hour and try the other menu items in the future.  A nice atmosphere, with outdoor seating.",

Bartenders are great and everyone was friendly, good at making drinks. My friend got the corn but it wasn't salted enough for her and the mayo sauce they had wasn't enough on the corn to make it as flavorful as when we make it at home.

I came with my husband then and the service was totally fine... buttttt I came with a party of 16 this past weekend which I think may of contributed to the lackluster service. I was never asked if I wanted a drink- we ended up getting out first round from the bar. I ordered the 3 taco plate and after a food runner shouted out three tacos that I didn't order several times the server ended up just giving them to me and told me that's what I ordered? This place is noisy and they literally called out every item of food like that- to a party of 16. So odd? Why would you not have seats numbered or something to make that process smoother. So I ate the tacos that I didn't order and they were fine. Had some bites of the a beef bowl- cheese crisp and gauc- all were again, fine. I had to wave down the server to get a second margarita- ordered a skinny mermaid marg (same as first marg I had) then received a house marg- told the server and she said no that's a skinny and ignored it. I hate disliking a place... but will not be back.",

Our server was very nice, but that was the only highlight. Our table was very crooked and wonky (more than usual and probably my dangerous). When we mentioned to server, she said \"yeah it is.\" Our food came out wrong - it happens, I get it. But the manager brought the missing ingredient and mixed it into our food at the table. No apology, no offer to correct, no words. We asked 3 people 4 times for silverware and got it after our food was cold. Empty tables were sat while they were dirty. I get busy bars (and I worked in them for among time), but this is the worst. Adios, Salty Senorita. We won't be back.",

Both of us got specialty margaritas and they were way too sweet with what seemed like barely any alcohol in them (but maybe the sweet flavor masked the tequila). We got tacos and they were really disappointing too. We were really hoping that the food and drinks would be at least adequate, but everything other than the service was really lacking. The pricing was what you would expect in old town, which made the poor food and drink feel way too expensive. With so many other options in the area, I would skip this place.",

We wrote a review and were promised that things would be better for our next visit. lol well..... we decided to give it one more try!! We went for lunch on Friday, after we sat down the waitress informed us they ran out of chips the night before! She kept saying she couldn't believe when she heard they ran out the night before!!! We decided to leave since chips are a MUST when you go eat Mexican food!  As we were leaving and walking through the patio, every single table had chips and someone even had nachos!!! This made ZERO sense to us. How could you run out of chips Thursday night yet everyone on the patio had them???? So, needless to say, that was our very last visit to The Salty Senorita!!",

All the places that we wanted to go had 1-2 hour waits.  However, Salty was able to sit 9 of us right away.  After having the meal, I see why.  I ordered the Machaca and egg burrito.  The food was just not good.  I had bones in my meat, and the rice looked and tasted more like mashed potatoes.  How hard is it to cook white rice?  And who puts white rice in Mexican food?  A really bad Mexican restaurant does.  That is exactly what Salty is.  It should really be called \"Crappy Senorita,\"  Or to keep the alliteration, \"$hit*y Senorita.\"  I'll make sure I don't use inappropriate language on here so that this review does not get removed.  Anyway, when I come back to Scottsdale, I won't be returning here.  No gracias, no me gusta.  Halz3 did enjoy the chips and salsa though......  I'll leave it at that.",

This is a great after spring training spot, but for me that is about it.  The drinks are overpriced and not that great and the food is mediocre.  The cheapest thing on the menu are the  tacos and they are the size of my palm.  It's a bit overpriced for 'fast food', which is what it's equivalent to.    however  they are located in a great spot and have a fantastic patio, that's why you go, as do I.",

We waited 10 minutes before the hostess came and asked if we had been attended to yet.  Of course not so she brought us water and said she would return with chips.  Another 10 minutes later she brought those.  Close to 10 minutes more and the \"replacement \" waitress takes our order.  And how long before drinks arrive?  Yes, 10 minutes but only the alcoholic drinks.  My sprite took another 10 minutes even though we were next to the bar.  Finally the food comes and it is good.  I ordered the grilled shrimp bowl and hubby got the steak salad.  Shrimp could have been bigger.  Rice was cooked perfectly and the combination with the black beans was good.  If you have lots of time to kill, check this place out.  No free wifi.  We sat outside so we picked it up from RnR across the street.",

We could go, get tanked on buckets, and have $5 wings or tacos. The wings, GONE completely. The TACOS? Trendy, tiny and expensive. The drinks? Mucho dinero. They were missing the tamales and tortas from the menu \"we don't have them\". So my friends and I, and there are a lot of us some Fridays, we all ordered the new \"Barrio Queen cheap copy\" tacos. And burritos.   I feel like I buried a friend. And to top it off, my beloved got food poisoning and about lost the chicken burrito on the way home. Time for a new happy hour, friends!  Oh, and my normally $35 bill was $80. Yikes!",

It took the new server 15 minutes to get our drink order. At that time we made our food order too because we were starving and ready. It then took getting a manager to get our waters. When we asked the manager about our food, saying it's taken a while he questioned us what a while was, \"10 minutes? What do you mean a while?\". 40 minutes Fool! Our food took another 40 minutes and was cold and they forgot half the order. My burrito bowl was probably the grossest thing I've had in my mouth in a long time. Not once did our server apologize or give us a timeline. Luckily, he took care of my bill. But when he brought my card back, which they required to hold on to in order for us to even order (who does that?), he had charged me $14 for two margaritas I did not have.  This place is a failure at everything they do. I absolutely can't stand places where the attitude of the staff is of total arrogance and entitlement. I was treated as if I was lucky to even be here.

The new building had a funky odor going on inside so we opted for patio seating. As soon as we sat ourselves at one of the 7 open tables we were approached my a manager saying that we had to wait to be seated by the hostess. Upon mentioning all the vacant tables he told us that they were in the process of \"tracking down\" those people to seat them. So we stood up and lingered until we were given permission to sit back down at the same table.  The table side guac was great but the server never returned to take our order for entrees. We finally flagged down the manager who apologized and began taking our order until the server ran over to relieve him of her duty. He then told her how embarrassed he was for having to do that...awkward. We then continued to wait for our food for 30 minutes before I finally called the manager over again and told him they obviously forgot our order somewhere and we wanted to leave. For the negative experience he comped us a round of cheap girly shots (Washington apples or something) and presented the rest of the $25 bill.",

We had a server tonight that I had never seen before so I wasn't expecting great service, however, I was completely wrong!! Her name was Nikki B and she was awesome! Super cute, funny, and very attentive to all our needs, which can be a lot when we're out to eat.  She was always there when we needed another drink and brought us extra plates for sharing and plenty of napkins without even having to ask! A real gem in the restaurant business!! What a great salesman as well, I usually don't order dessert when I'm out but she convinced me to try the chocolate cake concoction!! And it was sooo good! Definitely coming back in again soon to have Nikki wait on us!",

The owner/manager was out helping and mingling with the guests.  That impressed us because we never see the owners or managers of our local bars.  Kudos to this small business.",

We came with a party of 6 on the last night of our vacation looking for good atmosphere and good Mexican food.  All the meat from chicken to carne asada was hard and dry, the tamale was water and masa which was hardened and none of it had any flavor.  We left still hungry (we couldn't eat the food) out $140 bucks and angry.  One star is generous and I give it that for being in a cool location and our waitress was nice.  I feel bad for the wait staff who are probably stiffed tips due to the food.  DON'T EAT HERE.  EVER.",

Went there on a Thursday afternoon to check out their Happy Hour and watch the game.    Their HH menu was pretty weak - i ordered the taquitos off the HH menu.  It still came out to $4 for 3 really greasy fried taquitos with barely any meat inside.   Not impressed.  I opted for the 6 tacos of your choice off the dinner menu to share with a friend.  The 6 taco platter was priced at $17.  And they ran out of corn tortillas. I wasn't impressed with any of the tacos - i think I could of had better at a California franchise like rubios.   Well drinks were 1/2 off so i did get a vodka gingerale (homemade gingerale) for about $3 - so that was probably the only thing i really liked that night.   My friend got a margarita - that there was no HH special on it  - i figure there should be at least a few bucks off every type of drink during HH but guess not  This HH/dinner meal came out to be $40 - not worth it - food wasn't great and no buzz off the drinks.",

Driving along Scottsdale road to the hotel, I saw happy, tanned patrons drinking magaritas and eating guacamole - OUTSIDE! Really, the restaurant could've been called \"Salty Turds\" and the fact that there was a patio that I could sit on in the middle of February would have been enough for me.   The patio was packed at 6pm but the hostess was really great about keeping a lookout for a table and before we could finish our Coronas, we had a small table for two. The food was just okay. It didn't wow me, but I wasn't spitting it out in my napkin either. I was only in town for the weekend, and with so many cute places around Scottsdale, I wish I would've resisted the allure of the first patio I laid eyes upon and tried a place that would have food to match the ambiance.",

We had to scarf it so fast not even sure I got to really enjoy it. Plus my friends never got a refill on her drink either maybe the worst service ever..... I was so Bummed I have wanted to stop in and eat here for a long time, but the food is WAY over priced and frankly not that good and the menu selection was also really slim pickings. The reason I did give two stars was because the salsa was amazing, but unlike most Mexican joints you had to order it, it was not complimentary. I love to go out and have Mexican food mainly because I love getting endless chips and Salsa. As a good will gesture our server did give me a to go dish of salsa but no chips to go with it. I really wish it had been different I was so looking forward to it.",

Then we order either the chicken or the steak tacos (I prefer the chicken), and then chat and eat and drink and maybe order another bucket and eat some more and chat and laugh. And it's a great evening.  I really can't speak to the regular food, but table-side guac gets 2 thumbs up from me, as do the chicken tacos. Delish. And also, their blended margies are great. I guarantee I'll be back :)",

The hubby and I stopped in to sit down and discuss some business we were doing in the area. He was starving, and it was the first place I saw. I liked the look of the outdoor deck so I pulled over.  Parking was easy - thankfully. They have parking in the back. The deck was nice and looked like it would be a great place to party at night. They have huge palms towering over the outdoor seating area and bar.  And they thoughtfully had outdoor heaters scatter conveniently about. It was comfortable and inviting outside.  This is definitely a party place.   We sat outside to eat & talk and looked at the sparse menu - not much to choose from. The food was - well - it was edible. My husband said \"for Mexican Food, this stuff is bland\". He had nachos and a steak quesadilla . He eats Mexican Food a lot, so he knows what is good and what is not. This food was not good. I only had a boring salad. The food can be expensive. They have $9.99 Tacos on the menu, but luckily, we did not order them. I would not recommend the place for eating - maybe for drinking and hanging out on the deck.   Seating could be more comfortable. They have pub tables with wood stools outside and small wooden dinning tables and chairs inside - all wood, no cushion, no relaxing. They did have about ten booths with cushioned seats though. They have 2 bars: one outside and one inside. They are not very big, but they look great. This place has a lot of potential. Sadly though, it looks like someone has just let it go - food and all. Beware of the bathrooms. They are disgusting, and they even have writing on the walls.   I left there thinking of the center city bars & clubs I would find myself in during my college party days. This would be a good stop for a bar crawl but not for anything else in my opinion. It has a great deck though - right along Scottsdale Rd. It has great potential altogether and the service was good!   Our bill was $39.00 for 1 side salad, 1 nacho platter, 1 steak quesadilla, 2 beers & an avian water.",

You can wear whatever you want- meaning shorts and flip flops are perfectly fine here.  On Sunday's, they have a make your own omelet bar that is pretty awesome too.

The dressing literally tasted like it was strait french's mustard.  It was gross.  My husband didn't even order anything off of the menu.

    "text": "Delayed in writing this review, but we had a pretty terrible experience to start. We had a group of 10 people going to dinner here for a going away party for a friend going into the Navy, on a Tuesday night in the spring. Most of us arrived and sat down within 15 minutes of getting our table. The server took our drink orders, and over 30 minutes later we still did not have our drinks or appetizers that were ordered. The server was nowhere to be found, not even helping other tables around us. Once we were finally so frustrated about the lack of service we asked for a manager at the front desk. After hearing of our experience he then ended up serving us the remainder of the night and we did not see the original server again. The food and drinks were alright, once we finally got service from the manager. He did end up taking care of some of the food costs which was appreciated and he did what he could to try to make it right. Being honest though, I wasn't that impressed with the quality and flavor of the food nor was the remainder of our group, and don't find myself ever desiring to go back regardless of the bad service to start. I was a server for a busy seafood restaurant for 5 years, and understand how tough the job can be at times. I almost always give a second chance to restaurants that I like the food but get bad service. This is not one that I will go back to, especially if desiring authentic mexican food. Thanks to the manager for trying to make it up to us that night though, he really did a good job otherwise. The 2 stars is based on the food as well as the initial service.",

Chicken fajitas had little chicken and I had to ask for salsa since my waitress never came back. Tortillas were maybe 5 inches wide and I was only served three of them. Asked for extras and was charged for 3 more. Waitress said she didn't check back with me because she was busy w/ bigger tables. Nice. Never going back.",

We were seated on the patio and didn't get acknowledged by a waitress till we had been sitting there for over ten minutes. Margaritas took quite a while to come out. Our food actually came out before we got our first round of drinks. The waitress also forgot to even bring out the child's meal we had ordered. She was very apologetic and said she would take our margaritas off the check. Our waitress came back and said she wasn't able to do that, so we got a card for a free appetizer. Yippee. Even though we enjoyed the food I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone until they figure out how to serve tables properly.",

Had appetizers and house margaritas with a friend today on a Thursday and the patio was busy but inside not so much and it was about 93 degrees out. Margaritas are now served in pint glasses vs the traditional glass which is a bit tacky for a Mexican place in the drinking business. Service was OK, a little slow at first.  I won't be racing back, but would go again if someone else really wanted to go. Preferably I'd go during happy hour when appetizers are 1/2 price and drinks a bit more reasonable because that was the only part of the menu that I found anything near normal Mexican as I know it..",

I always notice the restaurants that give you only good prices on food or only good prices on drinks, which is understandable but come on, just discount a few popular apps to go with those drink specials! Anyway, my favorite thing here isn't even the Happy Hour, though, it's brunch. The French toast with the agave maple syrup is sweet, heavenly perfection, and the pancakes are awesome too, especially the pineapple or coconut. The Potbelly burrito is definitely big enough to split, and goes nicely with a bloody Maria or two!",

    "text": "A SERIOUS downgrade.    Customer service is horrible. Prices are ridiculously high Food is overpriced and bland  The old Salty's was my preferred happy hour locale and was affordable as well.  A new location and bigger patio does not mean better.  Even worse is the new menu.  They need to fire the chef.  The nachos I ordered were soggy and those chips that were not soggy tasted like they had been sitting out for a few days... in other words stale.  I sat at the bar and even though I had a stool, it took me over 10 minutes to get service from the bartender.  The place was not very busy and when not serving drinks he was flirting with some girls a few stools away.  I asked the bartender what he had for bourbon and he shows me a bottle of whiskey.  I seriously face palmed and just shook my head.  I settled for a whiskey and coke.  He literally did not put more than 3/4 of a shot in the drink.  As I paid attention to how he made others drinks, I noticed that he was short pouring everyone.  Still not satisfied with the nachos, I asked for two a la carte tacos.  When they finally came out, they were absolutely bare, bland and tiny.  I miss the old Salty's where you could get some good food, a few drinks, free chips and salsa, and cold draft beers while spending less than $20 including a tip.  I do NOT suggest this place.  If you want to hit up a Salty's I suggest the one in Peoria.",

Recently, I actually went in with a couple other friends and tried the food.  It was surprisingly tasty.  I had the steak burrito.  The patio area is also nice, though I think the misters are a little over aggressive.  I'm also used to the service at Salty's being terrible, but the planets must have been aligned or Saltys is finally making some service improvements.  We had a girl named Fran help us.  She was absolutely awesome even though she did turn down my friend when he asked for her number.  Regardless, I'm sure we'll be back again soon.",

    "text": "I didn't know my cinco 2014 was going to start out with a bad taste and ill feelings toward others but a bartender at Salty Senorita accomplished that. I went to Salty like years before to start my cinco night out with a goal of sipping a refreshing margarita, unlike years before, the patio didn't seem that crowded (maybe it's a larger location?). My friend and I went to the main bar, and proceeded to wait patiently for the bartender to take our drink order. It was busy with more than 4 bartenders serving customers along with the manager, my friend and I were able to secure two bar stools, and we waited. There was a group of people to the left of me who got a drink order in even though they had been waiting shorter than us but I ignored it thinking she (the bartender) was just busy and hadn't noticed us, mind you we were sitting in front of where she was working. I remember a group of guys who were standing behind us asked if we were closing out because we had our cards ready but we said no and said we were waiting. 20 minutes had passed and still no margarita, so, we waited more, yes, I could see she was busy but I also noticed she was talking with the guys sitting to the right of us, and she was talking with a colleague at the cashier but for some odd reason when it came to us two sitting IN FRONT of her line of vision, she chose to ignore us, yet again stayed patient because that's how I am, I only get angry when I am being blatantly ignored BUT when the guys standing behind us moved to standing to the left of me, and SHE asked for their order, that was it, I had enough! So, I did what any annoyed customer did, I yelled a HEY! to her to get her attention (prior to that I took her picture), she then turned around (surprise surprise, apparently you need to show displeasure to get service here), and snapped back with, I don't serve people who swear at me! EXCUSE ME?!? when did saying \"HEY\" come off as swearing? And that was the last straw, I couldn't foresee myself staying there for a drink.   I asked for the manager as any customer would and I shared my displeasure with the lack of service I received. Yes, he offered a drink BUT that's not good enough, I refused because I just couldn't see myself spending money. So, imagine this Salty Senorita, afterwards my friend and I went to El Hefe and got ourselves a margarita, then afterwards we were looking to have dinner and proceeded across the street to Hi-Fi, and ordered food and more drinks, when our intention that evening was to go to Salty Senorita, grab a drink or two and have dinner. We spent close to $80 that could have been spent at your establishment but because of the discourteous service of a bartender who lacked the attention of scanning the bar as well as to check who needed orders and such, you lost a few customers. Now, that's sad.",

    "text": "I recently visited Salty's with a group of 30 of my friends who were all on a bar crawl. The bar crawl was during the middle of the afternoon on a Saturday. Salty's was a first stop and they were dead - they had 3 tables and maybe 4 people at the bar. When we told them we wanted to just grab a drink and then we'd be heading out to the next one, the hostess was immediately overwhelmed. They got a table ready for us but the waitress was rude and refused to put us on separate checks. So everyone started going to the bar to order drinks, and the waitress told me the bartender did not want to take our drink orders because it was too overwhelming. There were some people asking for water (it was 110 degrees outside) and the bartender said NO! My husband ordered a beer from the waitress and she never brought it out. Every single employee with the exception of one (I think he was a busser or a food runner, he was amazing, I wish I knew his name) was so rude, rushed, and annoyed that we were there. It would be one thing if this was the first time this has happened, but it's not. This is the 3rd year in a row that they have refused to serve us appropriately. I will never go back and neither will most of my 30 other friends from the sound of it.",

    "text": "This place where do I start honestly? Went last Thursday for lunch & like all the other yelpers said, theres still a wait because the hostess and the waitress are the same person. (Hire people. Makes no sense you barely have guest and you still have no hostess waiting to seat people). We entered the side which points to the \"hostess\" area to be seated, no hostess so as I'm looking around all perplexed the waitress as she walks by,  tells us to sit anywhere. We pass the bar area & make our way to the open back part. We go in take a seat, it takes a few minutes for the same waitress to come & give us menus, took longer to get our drinks. Seems like,  no wait,  she was the only waitress working during lunch hour too. With this kind of service, they SHOULD carry on the Mexican tradition and offer complimentary chips & salsa.     Anyways, so it's happy hour & since its a \"Mexican-----(NOT) restaurant I justtttt knew they would have some good margaritas during this time----(NOT). They advertise on their menu margarita(s) plural but that wasn't the case. They only have ONE margarita on their happy hour menu. The Senor---- should be renamed to the Peasant cos that drink DEF wasn't the MAN. It tasted like straight up, cheap liquor mixed in with some old mix/water that only a wino wouldn't mind. Terrible, yuck.    The food, wooooowww.  I can't even.  First off, we got the shrimp & fish ceviche, it was so flavorless,  it was ridiculous. Taste nothing like a REAL home grown Mexican restaurant ceviche where you can taste the flavor of spices, lime juice, etc. I don't think they even use SALT at SALTYS. And why was it served with just lettuce you are suppose to use as \"cups\"?? I read it on the menu but I just knew some crackers or tostadas or something would come along with. Nope, let's just say I couldn't even eat it.   How are you suppose to eat Ceviche with lettuce cups or a fork?! It just wasn't right. Ugh. Anyway, it tasted more fishy than anything. So, I got it instead to go & had to stop off at the store to buy what usually comes with it. (I hate when they try to change stuff for the worse. May look good but its completely useless if you can't hold the ceviche up on a lettuce end).   The mango shrimp taco too was nothing worth a thumbs up and too bad becos it sounded really good with the pina, mango sauce, etc.   And, sad too mention really but I also found a hair in my ceviche. Sho did & it seemed like nobody even cared, honestly. Although I seen the airhead Hawaiian looking tan \"rad\" beach bum manager going around asking guest how their service went, we didn't get the same treatment. He just brought back our new dish and mumbled something about being sorry about that.   Not a good experience & it looks more like a Hawaiian restaurant than Mexican with tiki head decors rather than Olmecs. Anyway, on to the next.   Disappointed,  good location tho right at the corner before entering old town Scottsdale. But parking, it's not in that big ol' parking spot right next to it. That parking belongs to a pizza place so on the street parking it is.",

The heaters for sparse and sizzle at all. Just flour tortillas we're hard and it cost an extra if you wanted more than three.

    "text": "The bf wanted to swing by the Salty Senorita for drinks and a quick bite before a Giants game during Spring Training.   The place was pretty busy on the outside, but kind of empty on the inside so we sat at the bar inside.  We were immediately greeted by two ladies behind the bar and given a food menu.  All seemed to be going well, but when you sit at the bar area, you see everything that happens behind the counter and what I saw was beyond foul and dangerous.    The only male bartender who was making the drinks behind the counter, first of all, was obviously intoxicated while on the job.  He was obnoxiously loud and having a difficult time pouring and mixing the drinks because he had more alcohol and ice on the counter compared to what went into the actual glasses and pitchers.  If Jon Taffer was there, he would have yelled at his ass, that's for sure.  Then, I noticed where the bartender was scooping his ice from when he was making the drinks.  He was scooping the ice from an open ice box where they also stored alcohol bottles.   I'm not a bartender, but I'm almost sure for health and inspection reasons, you're not supposed to store bottles in the same ice box as the ice cubes that you're serving in your drinks for sanitary reasons.  To make matters worse, the bartender was using a metal shaker and chipped glasses while making his drinks.  I don't know if he was too intoxicated to notice or if he just didn't care if customers accidentally drank glass chips or cut their lips on broken glasses.  I mean, you've got to wonder where the broken glass chips are if they're no longer on the actual glass.  After he was done making the drinks, he left the chipped glasses upside down on the counter and left.  He didn't wipe down or clean his station.  He left the melted ice and alcohol that he had spilled all over the counter drip over the edge of the counter and into the ice box that had the ice that he was serving to customers.  GROSS!!  I just kept watching the liquid drip from the nasty wooden counter and collect into the ice.  We had ordered nachos which came out super fast and as I was eating and watching all of this happen right in front of my eyes, I just lost my appetite.  If this is happening out in the open, I don't want to imagine how it is behind the scenes and how sanitary the kitchen would be!  We didn't finish the nachos, but I guess that was a good thing because underneath all of the chips was nothing, but a pool of oil.  Ewwww.  I have to say that the blonde girl with the short hair who was serving us did a great job on checking up and making sure we were taken care of.  Other than that, stay far away from this place if you don't want to drink broken glass!",

    "text": "We were in Old Town Scottsdale and most places were pretty busy due to the World Series.  We gave them a try mainly because they were not too busy and had a patio.  Once we were seated by the hostess, our server finally came over after about 5 or so minutes (she mentioned the hostess giving here incorrect description on where the table was).  We ordered drinks and water, and it took about 10 minutes to get the water, which was brought by the hostess.  She apologized and said they didn't have enough servers to cover, but I was unclear if this was normal or if they were short due to someone not coming in.  Either way, they were not THAT busy IMO.  After 20 minutes, we still had no drinks.  When she finally brought them she said the bar was \"backed up\".  I could see the bar clearly from where we sat, and I've watched bartenders that were slammed; he did not look that busy to me.  We also ordered food, and although my wife's order came out wrong, and we had to flag someone down to fix it.  Once we did, they got her a new plate out extremely quickly.  The manager did come over and talk to us without us complaining or asking for him, so that was really good and proactive on his part.  One thing I did notice though, their outside seating was covered in a fine layer of grit and sand.  Not unexpected for Phoenix when the wind is going, however they seem to keep plates, silverware and napkins at the outside tables at all times.  They were not exactly clean either; if I were them I'd have at least stored them upside down, or better yet brought them out as needed.    I do have to say, their food was quite good.  I enjoyed both the specialty margarita and the wine what we ordered as well.  So to give a synopsis, the good was great but the service was sub-par.  I do not know if this was normal or not, so I would give them another chance.",

    "text": "The only reason i even gave you a star in the first place is because you have to leave just one to post the review.. so here i am giving you a star... GRACIOUSLY.   I came here to celebrate my birthday and brought friends from out of state. We were expectant of a fun environment, good food, incredible drinks, and an overall great experience. welll... we should've known from the fact that no one was here when we walked in at dinner time that we were not going to have what we hoped for.  The playlist is so two thousand and L A T E. that ruined the vibes and makes this restaurant seem like they are inadequate to host a young group of adults just trying to have a good time in old town scottsdale.. (one of arizona's prime locations for tourists.. ~young tourists~)   Our server just completely shat all over us. she had zero personality and in fact made us uncomfortable. she questioned our ID's multiple times and even pointed out that we need to upgrade to a horizontal ID but she would \"let it slide for tonight\" like valid.. but don't make it a big deal in front of everyone it was awkward! our food was crusty and cold and she also made comments that we needed to eat our food faster so that it wouldn't be cold.. whosaysthat  and there was a crusted hair on the plate.. ew.   my margarita is watery and rebecca's beer was warm. for being a mexican restaurant they don't even give you complimentary chips and salsa and you can order bottomless chips but not bottomless salsa... so what am I gonna eat the chips with? my watery margarita???? nah. she rolled her eyes when we asked for chips and made us feel like a burden.  after reviewing what others had to say about this place i'm sure the manager Jim will hop on and give some half ass apology/patronizing excuse. But don't be fooled.. this place is behind a waste of money and prime space on Scottsdale Road. shoutout to RnR across the street.. should've waited the 45 minutes for a much better experience.   in the bathroom - 2 stalls out of order and a long wait because people were probably shitting from the food poisoning   thank you, next.",

I ended up getting the veggie tacos and the asparagus taco.   I requested for the veggie taco to not have the rice and beans however it came with it and I noticed it in the first bite. I sent them back and traded them for the asparagus instead. They tasted much better anyhow. They offered free chips and salsa. The margarita selection looked quite delicious.  It's unlikely that I'll return. Not because of bad service or anything, but more so lack of options for vegetarians/vegans. For drinks, maybe.",

The Order for 5 drinks, two of which were just vodka over ice (more on that later) took close to 20 minutes. Good thing they have bottomless chips and salsa.   The place was pretty dirty overall. Glasses, silverware and the table, which was not wiped down before we were seated. Service was ok but not great.   My Margarita, listed as the most popular, was not good in spite of the time it took to make. Too much ice and not enough liquid. The fix it yourself bloody mary bar for the vodka over ice was weak on ingredients- no horse radish.  This place is across the street from R and R, a loud vibrant bar. A deejay and dancing at 1:00 in the afternoon ? It was packed. I asked how Salty competes and was told they can't. Salty gets the overflow crowd, like us. My advise, find another overflow spot.",

But I guess every now and again you have an experience that just isn't worthy of the praise.   We were craving tacos and my husband wanted to watch the ASU game so we stopped into Salty Senorita for a few beers, grub, and the game. It was a Saturday afternoon and aside from the cool ambiance and a lot of TVs, it was pretty dead. It started off good - we ordered a bucket of coronas for $20 which isn't bad at all for Old Town! I also really enjoy their chips and salsa.   But then, it all went downhill. I ordered 3 tacos - one chicken tinga, one carne asada, and one shrimp. You guys - all 3 tacos lost their bottom as soon as I picked them up! Yep, all of the insides went falling onto my plate. Ummmm, what? Yes, corn tortillas can be sensitive but you're a Mexican restaurant, this shouldn't happen. SO, I proceeded to eat the insides with my fork and tried to salvage as much of the tortilla + ingredients as I could. Not only that, the tacos were SO BLAND. I make them better at home. It was so disappointing. I may have forgiven them for falling apart if they at least had good flavor, but nope! :(   Lastly, the service. Our waitress brought the wrong beers and never {literally never} picked up our dirty dishes. So after 20 minutes of letting them sit in front of us {and she literally walked by 2-3 times}, we took it upon ourselves to set them on the table next to us.   YIKES. This experience was not one to remember and I can honestly say that I won't be back.",

It just went down hill from there!  We ordered appetizers and they took forever.  We sat with no drinks for 15 minutes. Complained again.  Dinner took an hour to get to us after we ordered.  Anyone who sat at the table behind us on the patio got up and left the restaurant because they didn't get service. Absolutely TERRIBLE!!!! We were so disappointed it didn't matter if the food was good or not.  If I could rate them 0 for service I would!   Worst thing ever, when you are trying to entertain guests from out of town and it's disastrous.  They comped our entire meal/drinks, but it really did not make up for the bad experience.",

Soda does not belong in a margarita.  They even out it in their skinny one which well negates the purpose.  And tastes terrible.    I am glad I stayed because the taco Tuesday deal was a good value and the tacos were tasty.  I had the chicken and the carne asada.  Liked them both.  Seasoned very well.  Our waitress was nice but she brought every table chips except for us.  Multiple baskets to one table but never any to us.  Not sure whether chips and salsa are an appetizer that you have to pay for.  Could be.  If that's the case charging for chips is lame.  If not the case the waitress dropped the ball.  Wasn't a terrible experience and like I said the tacos were tasty.  But margaritas are important to me at restaurants and if they can't get them right I probably won't return.",

I would definitely suggest it to anyone who finds themselves in the Old Town area",

As a business that strives on alcohol, I would imagine the servers should be a little older and knowledgeable about the alcohol.  Sadly, our server had to be only 18 or 19 and had no idea about the drinks our group was asking for \"hold on let me go ask the bar what that is\" As for the food...absolute garbage for what we payed.  I don't like dumb ditsy servers and  awful food.  It makes it even worse when the music is so loud we have to yell at each other to talk.  I just wasn't into it, everything tasted like \"well\"...just a dirty cheap place.  My mother-in-law asked to talk to the manager after we waited 45 minutes on our food.  We never got his name but he straight up did not care and just said unless something was obviously wrong with our food when we got it, nothing could be done..and he walked away.  well..okay then..but never again!",

The worst margarita I've ever had in my life. When discussing margaritas with waitress she rolled her eyes at me as if it was my fault the margaritas were bad. Manager tried to help us but he failed to fix any of the issues. Thoroughly disappointed with every aspect of my visit, especially how terrible the margaritas were. Won't come back for quite awhile, if ever.",

The place was practically empty so it wasn't like they were busy.  We could see two people behind the bar.  One was on the computer and the other just standing around.  When the meals came one had avacado on the tacos after having been told that I was deathly allergic to avacado.  The meal was remailed but that also took a lot of time.  The quesadilla was dry and tastless.  The burrito bowl was over salted and 1 of the 3 tacos was pretty good.  We came here at the recommendation of a friend and we were terribly disappointed.  Luckily we were visiting a long time friend so the time wasn't completely wasted.  It is also very expensive for the portion sizes.  Our poor friend was so embarrased.   Definitely avoid this place.",

They have a fun and festive space, a great outdoor patio  and high energy dj that was rousing the crowd and spinning mash ups like they were facing the electric chair.    Food was decent but because I was driving in Sheriff Joe's county so I had to stick to wine and thats where service fell apart.  I didn't expect a world class wine list by any stretch, but I didn't expect the cute little bartender to act irritated out her mind and roll her eyes when I asked about wine by the glass.  I know its easier to pour a glass of wine then blend a top shelf margarita so I didn't really get the 'tude, but whatevs, we were on vacation and just trying to spend a little cash.  Bus boy was super nice and the bathrooms were clean and there is a decent sized parking lot so thats something.   I just wish they were nicer because we were sent there by a Diamondback player that rents my cousins house and highly recommended it as a fun place for three of the saltiest senoritas in the world.",

I met up with a co-worker for a quick happy hour before my Friday adventures. Parking was kind of ridiculous, so I valet'd. I didn't have cash on me, but the dude was cool to let me hit him up on the way out.  Service was good. Drinks were strong, and cheap. Tons of servers in this place, so flagging someone down isn't really a problem.  The patio looks awesome, but it was so damn hot. Sitting inside with air conditioning really hit the spot.  I'd definitely come back. Seems like a cool place to go with a good group of people.   And although I didn't eat here, the food looked like your standard \"mexican\" bar fare. Can't be too bad, but can't be too good for you either. Classic. Ha.",

The patio is misted and cool and they play fun music that isn't blaring so you can actually have a conversation.  The food is at a great price for how yummy it is.  Great flavor pairings all around.  Best combinations in their cilantro ranch hot wings and the senorita chop salad.    Best sandwich of the year award goes to grilled chicken with guacamole, jack cheese, bacon, tomato, and salty slaw served on texas toast (from their menu).  Awesome!  Our service was exceptional.  Real five star material.  After our meal we were looking for a great place to see the sunset.  Our server didn't know (she was pretty fresh) but in a matter of minutes we were approached by another gorgeous waitress that actually sat down with us and hand wrote directions to her favorite spot.  Really sweet.    Good ritas at even better prices.  Thanks, girls!",

The patio had a great atmosphere with everybody socializing and you definitely can't beat their happy hour menu ($4 margaritas, yes please!)  The food is bar food, so don't come searching for one of the best meals of your life. However, the servers kept our chips and salsa (yum) well stocked and the table side guacamole was great.

The outdoor seating under umbrellas was nice, but with the changing sun meant we had to keep rotating seats, and the metal stools got HOT!   Our waitress was very nice, and since we were there for lunch, before happy hour started, we ordered off the lunch specials menu, which were not a bad deal at all.  Happy hour is 3-7 PM daily.   First, we PAID for chips & salsa (although once you pay they are bottomless), and that was good. I got the steak salad, which would have been good but it was 50% made up of cucumbers! I picked all of those out and there wasnt much lettuce around the steak left. My husband got the 2 taco plate, with rice & beans. It was clear that rice & beans had been plated long before the tacos were, so that was cold when we got it. Had to send it back for new rice & beans. The tacos werent bad, but my husband liked the fish one best.  The biggest disappointment was that the margaritas were EXPENSIVE, and when I got the deluxe one it tasted gross. not even sure how to describe the base, as it wasnt lemon-ish or lime-sh, or sweet. Not sure what to call it, but it WASNT good. Stick to beer here.",

Our waitress Aleesa was nice and sweet but she must have had too many tables as we were nearly done eating ( if the fourth taco wasn't incorrect we woulda have been done) before checked on us.  She did get us the correct taco coming and gave it fir free but it was about a 10-12 minute wait fir that.... we then decided we were gonna move to the bar fir a drink.  Gave aleesa our credit card and told her we'd be st the bar. Sat down and the bartender grabbed his cc slip and didn't wipe the bar top in front of us off ( yes you could tell it was dirty, cilantro and onions that we brushed towards the back of the bar), grabbed us menus and we told him we were just going grab drinks as we had just finished, he gave us \"cocktail menus\" didn't say hi I'll be back in a moment, do you know what you'd like ( we didn't really need the menus because we know what we drink) he said nothing. After sitting there for about 5 minutes with no greeting from the bartender and no cc returned I had to go ask the host to find my card.  (5 employees/manager standing st the host stand talking- which was irritating as clearly the bartender and server needed help).  Again alleeesa was nice but you could tell she was overwhelmed so I dont think her bad  service was her fault, but as far as the bartender I'd give him a zero and probably wouldn't go back on his service and the other employees standing and not helping out.",

Half of our order came out wrong as if she wasn't listening when we were ordering. When we asked for the check she didn't come back to the table for over 20 minutes. I hope next time we are back in Scottsdale we are able to enjoy this place w out such rude and inconsiderate service.",

The drinks were great. Excellent Margaritas. Waitress did finally come by and asked if we wanted food and we declined. Never saw her again. We did end up having to go back to the bartender for another round. It leaves no imagination as to why there were so many empty tables there on a Saturday evening. I guess everyone else knew what I no know. You go there for the drinks and you will not be disappointed as long as you do not expect much service. I'll bet the waitress doesn't understand why her tips are so low!",

I would never recommend to come here. The staff was all pleasant and nice. That was the best part. The food and atmosphere was a giant let down.  Atmosphere - its a cool beachy/mermaid restaurant. Tables were fine, so was booth. Yet after being there for about 10-15 minutes the giant bar area I was next to opened up to the outside...when it was 113 degrees!!! One giant whole side of the restaurant was wide open, letting all the heat pour in. Obviously in cooler weather this is a great feature. But literally on this day, the high was 114, it was 113 current and there was even an extreme heat advisory issued. It got so hot inside it was disgusting. I had about 1/3 of a soda left that turned to water in less than 10 minutes because of the heat, all the ice cubes instantly melt. It was nasty feeling and I wanted to leave ASAP. Even if the AC was on you couldn't feel it and was a waste.  Food- I wanted to try 3 tacos and their street corn. The tacos were fine, but just fine. The street corn was terrible. First, it wasn't a cob, it was in a bowl. The corn was garbage. It was either canned or frozen, but it certainly was not fresh. Very disappointed. The rice the tacos came with was also dry and crunch on top, meaning it was dished and sitting for a while or was dried out with heat lamps/microwave heating.",

We sat outside at first but it was 1000 degrees so we moved inside so we didn't die of a heat stoke.   Our waitress Maria was amazing. Very attentive and energetic the entire time we were there. I asked her for recommendations and she was very helpful.   I ordered the surf and turf skewers which were delicious and my steak was cooked correctly and not over cooked at all which a lot of places struggle with when it comes to skewers. The shrimp was good as well and the entire skewer was seasoned great. The green tea shot was super good. I've only ever had them when I come to AZ because if forget they are a thing until I come here. My only minor complaint would be that the happy hour margarita is very salty. It was tolerable and the prickly pair flavoring I added helped to mask it a bit. But the salt taste was quite prominent in the drink. However, I would go back again. Everything else as great and they were very accommodating when we asked to move due to the heat. No complaints at all from the staff and they were kind and helpful.",

To start things off, the restaurant was pretty slow (dare I say dead), so I expected a somewhat average quality of service (I usually cut a restaurant some slack when they are slammed). Our group of 10 ordered bottomless mimosas, which took a VERY long time to come. Once they did come, our server left, never to be seen again. Eventually, a few of us got desperate after waiting for a while with empty glasses and had to bother the bartender, who apologized for the wait and was more than happy to give us refills (5 stars for that bartender!) When the food came, we had to triple check orders with the foodrunner. Our table's order overall was correct, but when he handed them out, he kept saying names that were different than was was written on the menu, and dropped them at the wrong seats, causing a fair bit of confusion. The food was decent but nothing to really write home about. Once we started wrapping up, it once again took a while to get our server's attention so we could get boxes and cash out. Overall, 1 star for our server, 5 stars for the bartender, and 3 for the food. If I'm ever in old town and want a Mexican style brunch, I may consider coming here again and just hoping i get a different server.",

We were seated quickly and enjoyed the beautiful AZ weather by seating in Salty Senorita's large outdoor seating area. The restaurant wasn't very crowded, our service was quick and there were no smokers in the patio area.  My friend and I enjoyed Rocky Point Flights and favored the Sunny Siesta. I wish the Blackout margarita was spicier, it tasted like a regular house margarita. The La Paloma was too sweet for my taste, I couldn't finish it. I am glad I tried the Rocky Point flight because it is hard to choose with so many margarita options. Next time I will only get the Sunny Siesta.  Our server was very attentive and quick.  I was surprised that there were no complimentary chips and salsa. All Mexican restaurants I've been to offer complimentary chips and salsa.",

She had great suggestions for us, and checked on us frequently. We tried the seafood enchiladas which I highly recommend. We had a few drinks and stayed for about an hour and a half. We sat more in the dining area rather than the bar and truthfully that made a difference to our experience. We met with Jim (if you've seen the comment for this review), and he was such a great host and super generous. I'm so glad we gave this place a second shot, it's close to us and the food was amazing. Look forward to coming back!  ----------------------------------------------------  First time coming to this place, I definitely would say if you come to expect not great service. Our waitress let us know that she was training someone today, which is no biggie (congratulations, ya know?) but then they disappeared. It took a good 15 minutes to receive our food, which was great. You have to pay for chips and salsa which is weird, most Mexican restaurants it's an automatic gesture to the table. Would come back to try the margaritas, their alcohol selection is pretty wide range",

Luckily they were opened with just a few customers at the bar.   We ordered a round of drinks and appetizer plates that included: chicken quesadilla, ceviche and taquitos. The food was okay, nothing to complain about but also nothing to rave about.   However, the reason for my lower review is due to the service and lack of urgency or attentiveness. If this location was incredibly busy or understaffed, we would understand why it was slower or harder for our waitress to keep up on our orders or requests. The unfortunate thing is it wasn't busy. It took a very long time to order, receive our food and drinks. At one point we gave our card in advance to pay but she didn't check on us in a while to ask for extra orders, give the check or even run the card.  It's unfortunate that the experience wasn't worthwhile and even made me think back to how quiet it was when we arrived. I wonder if the food and service could be the cause. I hope they get better, it's a great area and there is a lot of potential.",

I went with the enchiladas. They offer black beans which I'm not a fan off. That's okay though. I still enjoyed the food. The rice actually had flavor. The enchiladas were very tasty. The chips and salsa were good. The salsa was a little spicy but when you're drinking it doesn't matter.   There is a happy hour for drinks and food. The inside of the restaurant smells delicious!!

My favorite is the watermelon margarita which is delicious and refreshing!  The food is also pretty good here.   The only disappointment was the chicken tortilla soup which was tomato based and tasted like carrots.   Instead go for the tacos which are always pretty good!",

It wad nice that we didn't have to wait for a table during lunch time in Old Town on a Sunday but after eating and our service, we found out why.  Our server was polite but for a place that wasn't very busy, she forgot that we ordered appetizers and was incredibly slow.  The food was very disappointing. It was borderline cold and just not very good. Kids chicken strips were dry, my shrimp bowl was terrible and the burrito was ok. We could have done better at Chipotle.",

It's the same thing the last two times we went. And the crazy thing is that the managers don't care either. As long as people keep giving them money for bad service, they're never going to change.

Visit another fine eatery in Scottsdale--there are many--all better than Salty's at this time. Maybe in the future Salty Senorita will regain its glory of old. But, for now, stay away.",

I ordered a carnitas burrito because cheddar wasn't listed as a feature, unlike everything else, and it came with gobs both inside and on top. Wet means saucy, not cheesy!

Outdoor seating on an Arizona hot night? NO problem because they have outdoor coolers that make it a great night.  Love this place. You will too.",

We never ate there but they did bring tasty chips and salsa. I think we ordered guac too and it was good.   I don't understand the low ratings but te beer is cheap. There's a ton of waitresses and they do a decent job of paying attention to their areas. They are all attractive too.   I remember the beer prices being reasonable and the patio is the place to be. I would say this is spot is as popular as momos is to giants home games. Minus the fine dining.",

If you're lucky enough to go there on a Sunday morning, you might ask for a mimosa, however, you'll get a MANmosa (if you're a dude). No joke I ordered a mimosa and she came back with a giant glass and said, \"I could have put it in one of those cute flutes, but I figured this suited you better.\" Good call.

We got there around 9PM tonight, Saturday night, and there were maybe 6 people inside and about 20 outside, it was deader than dead. The bartender was very friendly, we all ordered drinks and he was upbeat. The drinks were absolutely horrific. Two tequila sunrises and a vodka soda should be easy enough. We took them outside to enjoy the evening and hoped it would pick up. Got out there and we all about spit out our drinks they were so terrible. I tried to drink mine thinking maybe something wasn't right with me lol! Then my other friend said her drink was so bad she didn't think she could drink it. We decided enough was enough, between being dead as it gets to the worst drinks we ever had, it was time to bounce. Gave it 2 stars because the bartender was very nice. We didn't complain about the drinks since we weren't sure if he were to of comped them he'd have to eat the price himself. We left the drinks full at the table and headed out for the rest of the evening. I had heard this place was really fun and great drinks so needless to say, it was a massive let down.",

First we never got the appetizer and the main course was not good my rice was hard and looks and taste old, the beans were hard the chicken was ok . I ask for the hot sauces on the side and they put inside. At the end we order another round of drinks cause we need a drink after eating that and we never got our drinks. Service was OK I guess.

I didn't think much of it, but decided to wager my luck and obtain a ticket by checking in on FB, and I WON!!!  Aside from this fortunate occurrence, the service was truly above average.  I had three bartenders rotating to help me, all of who were extremely friendly and seemed excited about their beach themed bar for the evening.

It wasn't super strong but I got a good buzz out of it. It was some kind of special, I think it was called Margarita Monday so it was gigantic and only $6!! The food was mediocre and was overpriced in my eyes. The only thing that stood out considering the food was the fact the the waitress made the guacamole from scratch at the table! Talk about fresh! It was so good and the table demolished it. I would return for drinks, especially if I were craving a margarita but probably not for food.",

The in-house salsa is pretty good though as is their cheese dip.  However if you're looking for generic Americanize Mexican food it's not too bad I guess.  Where Salty's excels is the outdoor and open air seating in a cool part of town. Even on hot days misters keeps things cool.  Coupled with a good house Margarita, cold beer and good music it's easy to get swept up in an afternoon or evening of relaxed drinking with a few friends. There always seems to be some sort of discounted drink or food special.  Baseballs spring training brings even more specials.  Service is typically good and if sitting at the bar better than average.  At first glance Salty Senorita's is the type of place I avoid. Yet I usually find myself enjoy stopping in. My advice is to have dinner somewhere else, then stop in for a few drinks.",

We were asked if we wanted to sit outside or inside and we chose to dine inside the restaurant because it was too hot.  My problem eating inside is that the music is too loud.  It's very difficult to converse when the volume is turned up to the max.  My friend's father asked our waitress to lower the volume so we can talk, but we didn't notice the difference.  Oh well.  On with the food.  We were provided with chips and salsa and I was dissappointed.  The salsa was bland and too runy.  I believe Chevy's salsa taste better than this.   The food is standard tex mex restaurant menu and prices.  I ordered the chicken fajitas and they were very good and tasty.  I was so full that I was unable to finish it.  My wife ordered the the shrimp quesidilla and it was okay.  My friends enjoyed their food, but nothing to knock us of our feet.  As I wrote earlier, other than the chips and sales everything else was ok. Nothing to call home about, but also not worth complaining about either.   Our waitress was very friendly and attentive and the ambitance is very lively.  Overall...if you want tex mex, nachos and maragaritas...The Salty Senorita is the place for you.",

When we went to cash out about 10 minutes later, their systems were down. They had our credit card, but couldn't close out, because the system had crashed. Initially we waited patiently. After 30 minutes had passed, we still sat there waiting for their system to be working. At that point, we had somewhere to be. The male working the bar kept saying, \"the manager is trying to get the system working. Have another drink and we will get it working.\" After 45 minutes, we were still waiting for their system to work. The people working the bar, particularly the male, was a rude tool bag. Probably the absolute most inconsiderate human being we've ever come across.   We knew the system crashing was not his fault, but in no way was it our fault either. Don't tell us to \"have another drink,\" when we had been patiently waiting for their system to work for 45 minutes. It was absolutely ridiculous. Don't waste your time going here.

Most everyone else was new for me and I enjoyed getting to know them. Good conversation about the upcoming Taco Festival and next year's Scottsdale Culinary Festival. Great meeting Patrick & Robin. And I also enjoyed meeting the very tall and very attractive woman selling wooden beads.  Using information I gathered while speaking to Patrick, I was able to impress her with my knowledge of the Culinary Festival after he left. Thanks, buddy.  I sampled two kinds of tacos and they were amazing - and who could miss the Fundido? I will definitely come back and try Salty's tacos in the future. A large game of Jenga was occurring behind me; however, due to past run ins with the Parker Brothers folks, I am still boycotting Jenga.  The red velvet cupcakes were amazing and at the end of the night I was trying to determine if I could sneak an entire plate of them out the door before being noticed. Since I skipped running and spin class to come to the event I shouldn't compound the problem by woofing down 20 cupcakes. At least that's what I told myself.   A great night of friends, fun, and tacos - with a couple of shots of Cruz Tequilla. Perfect.",

The nachos were drowned, only the top layer was edible and not fall-apart soggy. The crab guac was uninspired, simply guac with a bit of crab dumped on top with sriracha accent.  The chipotle chicken burrito was more promising, very cheesy and the chicken was tender. Overall a good experience, maybe better with different menu items.",

    "text": "Went to dinner at this restaurant last night for the first time. When you walk in the atmosphere is actually really cool. The place was pretty empty so when we were told to have a seat anywhere we chose we had a lot of options. After sitting down we watched multiple servers walk by and not one person acknowledged us. After about 10 minutes a waitress came up to us and asked if we wanted anything to drink. I asked her what \"Maria's choice\" margarita was and she didn't have any idea what kind of tequila was in it. After I got my margarita I asked her again what kind of tequila was in it and she responded with \"something with a c\". And to top it off the margarita was terrible. I got 3 tacos which weren't bad but they weren't good to say the least. My date got the steak fajitas which came with beans, rice, shredded cheese, guacamole, homemade tortillas and sour cream. It had obviously been sitting out for a while because the cheese was hard, not just a couple pieces, the entire bowl. And the rice was overlooked/burnt. The steak was burnt, tough and so chewy. Our server was nowhere to be found. I had to flag down a different waitress to talk to her about the cheese and rice. She was very kind and understanding. Eventually our server came out from hiding to check on us. Our waters remained empty almost the entire time we were there. She dropped off the check and came by to check for the money multiple times. All of a sudden she wanted to give us service. Eventually she asked us to pay so she could go home.. Luckily I had good company because overall the experience at this restaurant was terrible.   At least the homemade tortillas were tasty.",

There were probably not more than 15 people on a Wednesday night. Yet Drink orders were forgotten at the bar for 30 mins and all mixed up. Waitress didn't know one drink from the other. Nachos had no seasoning. Grilled Mahi tacos are great as long as you're O.K with a side helping of hair strands.",

    "text": "I used to really enjoy going to Salty Seniorita -- but maybe cause that was like 5 yrs ago or so, when it was alot busier!  I dunno. It just isn't the same for me anymore. I'm hopeful... and I still keep givin' them an annual chance; but after a recent visit here, we probably won't be goin back for a while.   We're always drawn by the thought of their \"used to be so good\" fundido queso dip. Meh. Now it's pretty bland and a bit soupier.   We went during happy hour -- so all the appetizers were half off. Again, we had the fundido (meh!) and the Girl in every port platter (which basically was their sampler platter). The sampler platter was normally $15 -- which I don't think is worth that. It was alright, but nothing crazy.   My margarita was $4 for happy hour, and my husband's beer was $2. Not bad... can't go wrong with a Coors Light. My marg was pretty weak and watered down.   All in all... pretty similar food experience since our last visit. (Seriously a year ago.)  But... service was kinda annoying. We had a server in training, who was being shadowed by her \"trainer\". So literally we got questioned on everything twice - over and over and over and over -- it was ridiculous. The server in training was doing fine; it was just redundant double-checking on the other server's part.   Again, okay food wise -- I wouldn't want to pay the regular prices though for their appetizers.   Happy Hour was 3pm to 7pm. Go there then.  Also they participate in the US Airways Dividend Miles Dining program. (Glad I got some miles...)",

Our waitress was really attentive even though we were with a big group and my wife seemed to like her margarita. That's it.  The food was as bad as i've eaten in recent memory. The chips seemed old and stale (salsa was pretty good though). I ordered the fajita burrito with red sauce and a $2.99 thimble of Guac on the side.   The food came out in about 3 minutes which should have been my first clue. The tortilla was rubbery, the red sauce tasted just horrible, and the steak had absolutely no flavor what so ever. The burrito was about 60% onions, 30% flavorless chewy steak, and 10% peppers.  To be fair.....my wife said her carnitas taco's were decent.   My advice would be to come for the drink but eat elsewhere.",

Being from a California beach town, I have an affinity for bars that go for that feeling, which Salty Senorita does. I was sort of worried that our food was going to be mediocre, because the place is a little run down, and I was so pleasantly surprised! My taco salad was filled with fresh spring greens, real black beans instead of the refried stuff,  and a yummy spinach tortilla fried crust. My husband's enchilada-style burrito came with a delicious enchilada sauce (just how tex mex red sauce should taste). Coors lights are only $2 till 7, can't beat that!",

I must admit being a little nervous about going myself to a bar I've never been to party with people I didn't know, but thanks to Lynn W's encouragement, I made it, and I'm glad I did.  I'm rather shy when I'm around new people in a new place, but Lindsey helped with that right away by bringing me to the Cruz Tequila sampling.  A couple small shots *samples* and things were better already!  I found a seat at a table, ordered a margarita, and checked out the group.  I felt a little out of place at first, everyone seemed so young!  I wasn't sitting alone for long, I met Rick and David from EaterAZ, the group sponsoring the Taco Festival next month. They were a riot!  I just might have to attend to the Taco Festival now.   Another margarita, a couple yummy tacos and I was feeling great.    It was great meeting Mark, we were chatting for so long, that all of a sudden we realized everyone else was gone!  All the tables were cleared, and the only thing left from the UYE was the plate and a half of red velvet cupcakes.  Sure was tempting to walk right out with them, they were YUM!, but one cupcake was enough and they were sitting all alone when we left.  I sure hope someone from the bar enjoyed them, they were too good to waste.  All in all it was good to step out my comfort zone, meet some new people and have some drinks.  Thanks Lindsey for putting this together and making me feel welcome.  I'll for sure be around for more events!",

The outdoor patio has misters so the seating was tolerable with the high heat. The waiter greeted us promptly and took our orders.   I ordered a sauteed shrimp taco and a grilled chicken taco. Both were around 3 dollars. They are street taco size. We also ordered chips and salsa which was an additional 3 dollars, but it was bottomless. The salsa was decent.   I ordered a flight of 3 frozen margaritas for 12 dollars. A little over priced as their regular margaritas during happy hour (3-7pm) are 4 bucks. These margaritas were small, honestly, all three were probably the size of one normal one. And it was three times the price. If I would have thought it through I should have gotten one or even three full ones it would have been the same price. They should really discount the flights during happy hour. But they tasted great! The frozen marg flight is prickly pear, mango and strawberry.   Overall, I would only go again during happy hour for drinks. Since the margs are such good price during happy hour (4 bucks). The food was ok, not great.   The images below are taken before food was eaten and before I took a sip of the margaritas so you can see how small they are.",

So we asked and the hosts said well the server has her limit for now. Then said we could wait by the bar and get drink. 15 minutes went by and the bartender looked at us twice and not once asked us if we wanted a drink. Finally the six of us got up and left. So today my wife and I decided to try it again. We walk up to the hosts and again 10 tables outside are open. She said it's going to be a 15-20 minute wait. I looked at her and said what the hell for. You have 10 tables open. The host said well we only have two cooks and we need to let them get caught up. WTF let people sit down and wait. Owners you need to fire your hosts. Absolutely will not ever go back.  Thank you to the management for your response, but when you have ten tables open and three hosts standing behind the host station doing nothing, maybe two of them should have been waitressing. Either or it's poorly managed. Understaffed or whatever the problem was we ended up at Barrio Queen. Absolutely one of the best Mexican restaurants we've ever eaten at. I highly suggest Gringas Tacos.",

I was apprehensive to go out because I didn't think we would receive any service due to the huge crowd. Our server Leia noticed us right away; super friendly and attentive. She made my wife and i feel like we were senators; super vip service. In a sea of people, she was able to go way above and beyond and make sure the service we received was unmatched. And it was. It's not often you see people who give 110% these days. I hope someone recognizes this about her. We certainly did!!",

Most of the group left after closing out 2 of us decided to stay and wait to meet a few other people after the Giants game for one more beer.  With our new group We where confronted by our server, Matt who asked us why we tipped so poorly and put the bill paid by some one else in our group neither of us, at the table.

I ordered three tacos, my husband ordered steak and chicken fajitas. A half an hour later we were told our food was coming out 10 minutes after that we were told it was coming out again. By 7:55 we were upset, inquired about our food. We were told there was a large group outside, which had absolutely nothing to do with us and that our food will be out soon. So obviously when we were told our food was coming out 20 minutes prior that was a lie. I asked to speak to a manager, and told the waitress we didn't want our food we were just going to pay for what we got which were Three Margaritas and chips and guac. At least the waitress did not charge us for any of those, but the manager never did come out. There are plenty of other places in Old Town Scottsdale to eat so I recommend you go to one of those others. We are at hula modern Tiki, and so far the experience has been so much better! By the way the Margaritas I had a Goodyear Ballpark we're better than the Margaritas I had at Salty's.",

The place was loud and unorganized, which was surprising because it was a Sunday evening and they were not busy.

Went to the Scottsdale location for lunch, ordered 2 beers (Negro Modelo) 2 \"house\" margaritas, an appetizer (nachos) and an entree from the lunch section (burrito).  Total bill... over $50!!!  Reason: The \"house\" margaritas are charged on your bill as \"Maria's Choice\" and cost $9.50.  Meaning, 2 standard drinks accounted for 40% of the bill..  There is no price on the menu, because, as the waitress indicated, \"The price changes, depending on the tequila used.\"  When asked about the \"House\" margaritas listed on the happy hour menu for $4.  \"Oh, those are different.\"  So apparently, they only offer \"House\" margaritas during happy hour, but don't mention that when you order them any other time.    Worst part, the $9.50 margaritas are served with more ice than marg.  Meaning, after you finish drinking one, there's still a full glass of ice.  Good part (for them) it doesn't take much to finish drinking one.  Big rip off.    Lesson learned:  Take your Groupon, ask the price before you order, or only go for happy hour.",

My question to ownership is......how many more 1 star reviews are you going to accept before you listen to your customers? You have a great build out and location so why don't you bring back the original chef and menu before it all goes south?",

Please....turn down the music a bit!  Food was fair - soup portion was very large.  Burrito was average.  Drinks seemed decent.  My wife enjoyed the fact that they had Corona Light on draft.  We got the fried ice cream for dessert - nothing special, we've had way better.    Can't recommend them strongly for the food, and did I mention the music was blaring?  I guess if you're in a party mood this might be the place to come, but definitely not for a relaxed, casual dinner.  The Brat Haus next door is a WAY better option.",

    "text": "Food = 4 stars Service  = 2 stars  This place seemed like it has a lot of potential. I'm sure it would have been great on a Friday or Saturday night. The Patio was pretty big, and looked like a great place to just hang out and watch the people or cars cruise on by...  We arrived just before happy hour started, not too much people, so not very busy. At first it seemed as though we were going to get some attention. We got a warm greeting as we got through the doors, as soon as we sat down, a server came by and asked if we wanted to see a menu and order a drink. We said yes, ordered a couple of Cadillac margaritas, and asked for a few minutes to look over the menu. Not 5 minutes went by when another server asked if we wanted to see a menu or order a drink. We politely told her someone had already took our drink order & that she'd be back to take our order.  So a couple minutes go by and a completely different gal comes back with our drinks. She doesn't ask if we were ready to order, but just drops off our drinks. Ok, I'm assuming the original girl is coming back right? Finally about ten minutes go by, and the second gal that approached us happens to pass by. We flag her down and tell her that the original gal never came back, and asked if she could take our order instead. She apologized, said they were having some shift changes and that the original gal was still our server, however, she'd be happy to put the order in for us.   Luckily, the order came out quick! It's not like we were in a hurry anyway, but the original gal came back to apologize, didn't say why she didn't come back, but at least she said sorry, right? Oh well!   On to the food... the tacos were not too bad. My friend and I weren't too hungry, so we just ordered an appetizer and a couple of tacos to hold us over till dinner. The bacon guacamole appetizer was yummy, it was served with some fresh, salted chips. Mmmm. Lots of bacon! Big chunks too! Probably more bacon than guacamole! Jk. (It's a good thing I love love love bacon!) Lol. I think I could have had more servings of it. =) The tacos were good too. Very flavorful. I had the grilled shrimp taco. Loved the avocado in it! My friend had the chicken one. The special sauce got me. Spicy, kind of a kick to it. Pretty good! The margaritas were ok. Nothing out of the ordinary.   All in all pretty cool place. There's a bunch of other places like these all over town. I'd say it was ok. Worth a try. If I do come back, I'd come later at night. Like I mentioned earlier, patio looks like a cool place to hang out and people watch.",

    "text": "COMPLETE AND UTTER TRASH WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD AT ANY ESTABLISHMENT AND I WOULD UTTERLY RECOMMEND TO NO ONE EVER COMING HERE!!!!!!  Where do I even begin! We got there and noone greeted us on a Sunday Afternoon for the Giants Game which we where there because a few friends where in town from San Francisco, CA visiting and they had SF flags all over.... THEY DID NOT HAVE A SINGLE GAME ON OR THE CHANNELS... can anyone say a JOKE!  NEXT we where just there for a few drinks and some food so we ordered our drinks and our food and the first waitress we had wasn't horrible but definitely in short attendance to the tables need and was rarely seen while glasses hung out on the table empty or practically empty.  We where then switched waitresses to the new waitress who I guess has won the award for WORST WAITRESS IN SCOTTSDALE MULTIPLE TIME or maybe it was just the staff overall at Salty who knows? She asked if we needed anything and I personally ordered a round of 5 \"house tequila shots\". This was my first time ever being at salty and I was just ordering off the happy hour menu that was in effect. The waitress proceeded to leave and come back about 15 minutes later from the bar that is not 10 feet from our table to inform us that the house shots are pre made and does not have tequila?? I proceeded to ask what it was made with... WOW SHE HAD NO IDEA LUCKILY my friend who had been there a few times knew that it was with flavored vodka ... NO BIGGIE moving on in life RIGHT?  Proceeded to just ask her to bring us 5 of those and that would be fine.... 20 minutes go by and I see our waitress at another table? I called her over and asked about our missing shots? she informed me that she was there to RE RE VERIFY that we wanted the shots for the going on 3rd contact we had had about ONE SET OF SHOTS!!! THAT ARE PRE MIXED!!!!!! I slightly quizzed her on the issue and asked if she saw anything wrong with the situation? She informed me not at all and I asked if her manager would because I would love to explain it to him.   IT GETS GOOD HERE!!!  SO the manager walks up with what I can only describe as a cocky and I could care less attitude ( YOUR A MANAGER IN \"INDUSTRY\" SERIOUSLY!!!!)! Proceeds to ask what had hapenned so I started to explain the situation while being constantly interrupted by him informing me I was wrong or that there was just NO WAY POSSIBLE that it had taken over 30 minutes to get said shots!!! NEVER AT SALTY...   THE BIG ISSUE is about 1/2 way through the explanation the manager starts LAUGHING!!!.. i mean seriously your in CUSTOMER SERVICE.. what are you going to do when your SERVICE ... GETS YOU ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMERS TO SERVICE???? who knows but I proceeded to ask  \"Are you laughing at me and about the situation?\"  his response- \" Yes, I think its quite the humorous situation\"  I proceeded to ask if you enjoys laughing at situations where his restaurant completely screws up and asked for HIS MANAGER  HIS MANAGER'S NAME WAS DOUG.... he wouldn't tell me his last name obviously I wouldn't either if I knew I had reviews about my restaurant headed to yelp!! HE Walked up to the table THREW the check on the table and said I heard we are having some issues! My buddy tried explaining the situation and was ABRUPTLY CUT OFF and we where then informed that \"WE WHERE ASSHOLES AND TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HIS RESTAURANT\"... now YOUR A GM AND YOUR CUSSING OUT CUSTOMERS BRINGING TO LIGHT THE HORRIBLE SITUATION YOUR SERVICE LEVEL IS AT IN YOUR STORE SERIOUSLY??? I then walked up to try and rectify the situation on the way out because I felt that the wait staff had OBVIOUSLY portrayed us as just being bad patrons! He proceeded to RUDELY TURN ME AWAY AGAIN WITH MORE LANGUAGE  AT this point I had had enough I walked outside to my group of friends and they all agreed that NONE OF THEM would EVER BE GOING TO SALTIYAGAIN because of this service.. by the way we had a group of about 8 people and had more on the way GOOD JOB SALTY!   SO IN THE END SERVICE IS HORRIBLE THE SHOTS WHICH WE FINALLY GOT AFTER GETTING OUR CHECK TOSSED AT US/OUR TABLE WHERE SUB PAR WEAK AND TASTED HORRIBLE!!! The food WAS DRY AND NON IMPRESSIVE and the Happy hour was SUB PAR for the location... In a State / city / bar scene where Tequila Cantinas / and MEXICAN BARS ARE VERY PLENTIFUL I WILL NEVER EVER and when i say EVER i mean EVER BE going to ANY SALTY SENORITA ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN! and I will tell everyone I know to never go there as well. I wouldn't want to put anyone I know through this CRAPPY of a dining experience... THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS TREATMENT!!!",

We came here to watch the Giants game because they have Giants flags outside but FYI they don't have the MLB package or even the MLB channel. Anyway, my friend ordered 5 house tequila shots.. 10 min later the waitress comes back to clarify the shot because the $1 \"house shot\" was a premade mix, not tequila. We said fine we'll take the house shot. 10-15 min later we were still waiting on our drinks so my friend called the waitress over after she was done helping the table next to us. We asked where our drinks were and this was the conversation:  Waitress- \"Oh we had to clarify the shot so she's making them right now.\"  My friend- \"I thought you clarified the shot 15 min ago when you first cake back? Are you clarifying the clarification now?\" Waitress- \"yea\" My friend- \"uh, okay. Can you please bring those over because we've been waiting 30 minutes and I don't think it takes that long to pour a shot\" (Manager comes over) My friend starts explaining the situation and the manager starts laughing.. My friend- \"are you laughing at me?\" Manager- \"actually yes I think this is pretty hilarious. You're obviously drunk so ill just get your check and you can go\" (He was not at all drunk and we still haven't gotten our drinks at this point\" General manager comes over, my boyfriend says \"I'm sorry about this misunderstanding\" and he says \"it doesn't bother me, you guys are just a bunch of assholes anyway\"  Seriously, were we in the wrong??

    "text": "It's hard to believe this restaurant even garnered the three-star average it has right now. I'm still mad at them for the AWFUL service we got recently. It was my second visit there, and I only went because my friend is new in town and wanted to try it (my first experience there was not great, but not as bad as this one).  The Good:  Yummy food. Not spectacular, but their queso dip and fajitas were tasty. They needed to be, because it took a really long time to get them, as well as our drinks.  The patio is gorgeous, owing mostly to the restaurant's surroundings in Old Town Scottsdale. The people-watching is fun, and they've done a cool cantina twist on shabby chic outside with an ocean theme and festive lights.   The Terrible:  We were seated in the north forty on the patio, for starters, which didn't help our service because as far away as we were from the other patrons, we were ignored by the servers as well as the manager.   Wait... it's no excuse that we were apparently sitting in the blind spot of the restaurant, because on my first visit there, we were right in the middle of everything and the service was still bad.  Things started off promising with a wisecracking server who seemed on top of things, joked around with us, and got our orders pretty quickly.   Then the wheels fell off. It took at least 15 minutes to get two simple drinks (my friend ordered a mixed drink and I had a soda, so our orders weren't complicated). We would've asked where our drinks were but no one, came to the table. After the drinks eventually arrived, the queso dip (an appetizer) took forever, and my friend went to ask where it was.  You'd think after he actually left the table to ask about things that the service would've improved, but instead our empty drinks were ignored and we weren't sure if our dinner orders had even gone through because we waited another half hour.  Finally my friend motioned to the manager and explained (politely) what was going on and that we had a movie to catch in Tempe. The manager made sincere-sounding apologies, telling us he wanted us to have a great experience and that he would make adjustments to the bill. \"I think you guys will be very happy,\" he told us.   I've worked in restaurants before, and once a table is unhappy enough that they seek out a manager, efforts should be made to make sure the customer leaves on a good note. Even if they're not completely satisfied, they're at least not angry.  But when the bill came (after much more waiting on our additional drinks and the bill itself), the manager had taken off 20%. Seriously. My friend then told me that before I'd gotten there, it had taken the staff a good ten minutes to seat him, and it wasn't busy, so he just had to stand there feeling like a goon. The place was maybe 1/4 full...  Cute place, and it's in a good area. The food was decent and even better as leftovers. However, they have a lot to work on, service-wise.",

There was a pack of about 20 waitresses running around and except maybe 1 or 2 they were dumb as rocks. I know that's harsh but please, my reviews are generally pretty positive. We had probably 5 different waitresses, mainly because they didn't realize our table was already being waited by someone else.  They were advertising specials on Coronas, $10 for 5 bottles in a bucket. Sounded like a pretty good deal until they came back with CORONITAS-- so half the size of a Corona. We were able to laugh it off, but it was pretty sneaky and shady how they presented it.  The food wasn't really warm when it came out, either. I get that it's busy and it's a holiday, but I really don't want a cold burrito.  Never again-- unless I happen to be hammered.",

I go to Salty's if I want to escape the desert, close my eyes and pretend like I'm at a seaside bar on the beaches of Cabo. With the patio and the ambiance, Salty's has that beachy vibe. It has the vibe that makes you want to drink one too many margaritas and escape reality for a couple of hours. Is it the best restaurant in Old Town? Nope. Do they have the best food? Nope. Then why do I go? I go because while everything is \"just ok,\" the ambiance is fun and they have one heck of a patio.   The food. First, start with the guac. They make it in front of you with fresh ingredients. Second, if you go for the Quesadillas, get them with steak. They taste pretty decent with steak. The tacos are good, but they are street tacos so they aren't very big. If you're really hungry, get between 2-3.   And finally. Sunday brunch! They have a fun Sunday Gospel brunch with tasty breakfast food. They also have excellent happy hour pricing and various specials throughout the week so a dollar definitely goes a long way!",

    "text": "Summary: Terrible service, blah food, slow, on a night with 1/3 of their seating taken.  This place WAS my favorite place for Tacos in Scottsdale, last night I took my friends who were out of town here. They were apprehensive of my decision bc they had gone the night before and a server never came to their table, after 15 mins they left. I'm not sure what's happened at Salty but there were multiple empty tables that the hostess couldn't seat us bc she had to buss them first (why is your only hostess bussing tables). We had to wait at least 10 mins on our waitress to show up, the margaritas were hand squeezed in Mexico, I know this because they took as long as the drive time to the border to arrive, and they weren't even delivered by our waitress, this other woman just put all 5 on the table between 2 of us and turned around and walked away, very weird, our food took longer, we joked with the waitress that we had heard one of the cooks had died in the kitchen, that went over her head. By this time we had been people watching enough that we noticed that every table around is was complaining.   Finally, our food came, our drinks were empty and once again, some guy who we had not seen all night delivered our food (where was our waitress?), the tacos were not on par with what I had promised my friends, we also had to go steal a stack of napkins and silver ware from behind the bar, we couldn't ask the bar tender bc he didn't even notice us waiting.   Lastly our bills, we waited 30 mins for them after asking for them, 2 stops from the manager, which we obviously complained, just like the 2 other tables next to us, another 10 mins past they finally came, they were messed up, it took another 10 mins for them to come back, and to top it off I didn't have cash so I gave the waitress my card, this took another 7 mins. I know the times bc this got so comical that we started a timer and started betting on the over under of how long each trip would take.   All in all we walked in at 7:55, got a margarita and Tacos, and were finally released from being held hostage at 10:20 pm. Completely unacceptable.   The waitress did relay that The manager  offered us a discount on our next visit, which he couldn't give on this visit, and he was some how going to remember us from this visit. Bone head!   What has happened to my favorite place?!",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place.  The vibe seemed really cool.  Actually, the vibe is cool.  And it's nice looking.  But so many wrongs completely cancelled out any good vibes.   First, I ordered a margarita blended.  The blender behind the bar was broken. That's cool; I understand that happens.  So I asked for the same margarita on the rocks instead.  The cocktail waitress said, \"I don't know if that's possible, I'll have to check.\"  I replied, \"They can't make any margarita either blended or on the rocks?\" And she again said she'd have to check.  Hrm.  I was confused, but whatever I'm an easy going person.  Maybe she was new?   Fast forward about 15 minutes.  Yes, about 15 minutes before we saw anyone again.  Keep in mind we hadn't even actually ordered any drinks yet.  Our waitress confirmed she could do the margarita on the rocks.  OK, cool.  I knew that would be the answer; glad she was on board now too!  We ordered it plus a beer.  Also ordered some tacos.   20 minutes later: the tacos come.  Still no drinks.  We asked the person who dropped off our tacos about the drinks.  He said he would check.  Cool; we're still patient at this point.  We can eat in the meantime.  The tacos were very, very disappointing.  Little flavor; very boring. The corn tortillas were soggy as though they'd been sitting for a while.  Two of the four tacos had gone cold.  We had planned on mentioning the cold tacos except no one ever came by before we decided we were so hungry we better just eat or pass out in the Arizona heat.    After eating half of the sad tacos, I finally had to chase someone else down regarding our drinks.  They reply they'll look for our waitress.  10 minutes later (at this point we are really timing this) our drinks come.  Great, except we've completely finished our food.  It was very irritating to go to a bar and get drinks served AFTER our sad food was eaten.  It was hot, though...freaking hot...and I can't wait for a nice, cold margarita!  So I dive into it...and it's got to be one of the worst margaritas I've ever had.  At least the beer was good!  Although the credit for the beer doesn't go to the bar, does it?    We even had to chase someone down to get the check.  We paid and left behind my half-consumed margarita.    Oh yeah, and a group of people next to us on the patio had a puppy with them.  It peed all over the patio floor.  A staff member saw the puddle of pee and laughed but did nothing.  Just stepped over it.  Gross.    We will not be returning here and will quickly warn others from wasting their money here themselves.  Again, we wanted to like you, Salty Senorita!  But you were terrible to us.  :-(",

I told my family Salty Senorita would be a great place to go from my previous experience. Our food tasted great! My family had a mixture of different tacos and I had the grilled shrimp burrito bowl. The grilled shrimp burrito bowl was SO delicious! Although, as we were eating we noticed the glass water jug the waiter brought out for us to refill our water glasses had MOLD at the bottom of the jug!!!!!! My family all had drank the water and they were about to get on an airplane right after lunch hoping they wouldn't get sick on their 4 hour plane ride home. We told the very nice waiter and she felt SO bad and removed some items off our bill. Once we got our bill she actually over charged us on the number of tacos ordered. Finally the bill was resolved and we left. It is worth looking at the dishes (and receipt) before bringing them to customers because this makes me question how clean the restaurant actually is...",

A friend had suggested SS.  Upon arriving at about 5pm on Friday (7/11/14) we found a pleasant and nicely set up restaurant/bar.  Perfect, right?  Meh, not so much...  We ordered iced tea.  The tea arrives and looks nearly clear.  We comment to Kristen that the tea doesn't appear to actually be tea and she said she would bring us tea from a fresh brew.  She returned a few minutes later with the same water looking drinks.  We tried to explain to her that this didn't look nor taste like tea.  Kristen said she would tell management...  if you have to tell management that the tea isn't tea the management will surely not be capable of fixing this problem.  It's AZ for crying out loud...  Tea is about the most popular beverage in the state.  We pressed on.  We ordered table side guacamole, fundido, and salsa.  All three were somebody's idea of making more AZ staples in new fun way.

There is less than 20 people in the establishment and we're two 50 year olds having tea and chips and they interrupt our convo saying \"hey, let's get wild and crazy\" or some such attempt at pushing their wares.  I'm sure this is probably a fine establishment to go watch a game and drink margs or beers, but that would be its maximum capability.",

    "text": "After eating here tonight, I'm trying to wrap my brain around all these negative reviews.  The service we got was great--our server Sarah was spot on, never letting our drinks get empty, friendly, and our food was served hot and fresh.  The decor is amazing, the food is reasonably priced ($3/fish taco at happy hour is just 50 cents more than you pay for the ones at the 24 hour drive through, and very tasty), and the seating is comfortable.  The appetizers were a little high, but the crab guacamole we ordered was terrific and worth a little extra.  Perhaps people went into this place expecting one of those Mexican restaurants where you stuff up on bagged chips and salsa then get a plate covered in cheesy rice and beans, a bit of lettuce, and something that looks like a burrito drowning in red sauce.  It's not that kind of restaurant.  It's a sports bar.  It's loud.  It's fun.  And the food is sports bar food--quality, yes, but still bar food.  If these people want the same old stuff, I'm sure there's a Chi Chi's somewhere in Ohio that still has a table available....  We will definitely be going back to check out the lunch specials.",

Bartenders are fast and informative if you have any questions. Best bar for a laid back friendly get together.

I got the Chipotle Chicken Burrito and it was the best burrito I've had in a long time. It was super cheesy, hot, chicken was cooked just right and it was a nice size. I don't even like beans but the black beans were delicious and so was the rice. Overall great experience. We will definitely be visiting again.",

The restroom was a mess. Of the 4 stalls in the ladies room, two were marked \"out of order.\" There was paper all over the floors and when I came out of the stall, one of the waitresses was trying to clean up the bathroom. I said to her nicely \"this bathroom needs some attention, there is no toilet paper and no seat covers.\" Her response to me in a very snippy tone was \"Well I'm trying but people keep going in there.\"  She was rude and flustered.

I ordered the La Paloma drink which wasn't too strong so I was happy with that. My boyfriend ordered the Carne Asada tacos and I ordered the Chicken Tinga tacos.

I think the person that sat us was technically off-shift at the time. Kind of odd. Our server checked in about the right amount. Table over from us got upset that they weren't getting their check fast enough. Someone at the host desk (some guy) later came over and started brow-beating the bar staff from the host table. Meaning - yelling over to them from about 20 feet away about how they weren't working. Super unprofessional and awkward and I honestly was waiting for Jon Taffer of Bar Rescue to pop out of a corner and start yelling at people about how unprofessional they were being and how uncomfortable they were making their guests.  Drinks: Fiance ordered the frozen margarita flight and I ordered the La Casuela signature margarita that was said to be served in a special bowl and made table-side. Her flight was good. She said it was too strong but I liked them a lot. She still drank them all. LOL. My margarita was sub-par. My fiance also pointed out that it said on the menu that they made it at your table - they did not do that. Flavor of this margarita was very muted and certainly nothing special. For being the most expensive margarita on their menu... it was a huge disappointment.  Verdict: There are far better taco joints within a 2 mile radius that you can go to and enjoy better service, food, and drinks.",

Asked for a cooler beer and the bar manager said \"hey we're busy that's as cold as it gets\". So my brother asked for a manager.....short story later this horrific bag of hot dog sh@i of am organization finally sent out a manager to apologize for her bar manager who lacked any fucks to give and her piece or shut server who was so hungover she couldn't answer a simple question like \"how are you?\" She literally grunted when we asked her. Worst place on Scottsdale. If I could shut it down it down forever o would. I wouldn't stop in here to take an emergency shit.",

Floor had a plastic bowl full of water under my chair along with napkins and items that needed to be swept up and it wasn't crazy busy.   I went to the restroom while my husband checked out the menu and that pretty much ruined it.    Two stalls were duct taped off with an out of order sign and the ceiling had a huge hole in it.  Dirty and dark bathrooms completely turned me off and made me wonder 'if they can't keep the bathrooms tidy where customers can see it, what does the kitchen look like!    Just gross.   We left and walked across the street.    Fail.",

We found the lively atmosphere fun (and not quite as overwhelming as some of the other spots nearby.)  We shared the guacamole and had a mix of tacos, which were all delicious. The chips are those thin Tex-Mex style ones, yum! I also liked that they offer the option of having lettuce shells for your tacos if you're in the mood for something a little lighter.   I ordered a skinny margarita and found it to hit the spot! My friend tried one of the house margaritas and found the mix a tad sweet for her - worth knowing!  We noticed the service, seemingly from the kitchen, was a bit inconsistent - orders seemed to come out at random. However our server was very attentive and sweet. It might have also been a bit busier than normal with the holiday.   Overall, we enjoyed our experience and will visit again next spring training!",

Our waitress was pretty good not the quickest in getting us our drinks. We actually had to go and get our last one on our own. The best part about our experience was another Waitress named Leila. She was super personable and so nice checking on us even though she wasn't our waitress. She even apologized when we said we had to go get our own drink. We for sure were skeptical on coming back however, with Leila's hospitality and friendliness we for sure will be back and make sure to request her!",

Lauren N was probably one of the best servers I've had since dining throughout the Scottsdale area. I recently moved here, and I don't usually take the time out to write yelp reviews. However, I left so happy and pleased with my experience due heavily in part to having Lauren N as a waitress! My party of 3 came into the restaurant during a busy rush/low staff time, and I could tell that she had a lot of tables to cater to. I noticed that everyone was so busy, but Lauren still managed to remain calm, whereas the managers/other servers were physically running and visibly showing they were stressed (which did kinda kill the environment/mood). I think anyone in the service industry (including the other employees at this restaurant) could learn a thing or two from how composed, helpful, professional and sweet Lauren was, despite being jam packed busy. My friends didn't like their margaritas and Lauren still took the time to ensure we were all having a good time and enjoying our food/drinks (that she recommended upon our request). I will be coming back and for sure requesting to be seated in Lauren N's section and I hope you all do the same!",

If you are on a health kick these will do you well as they are on lettuce and not in a tortilla. They had some flavor but not a ton. The salsa was not great - not hot and it's not a flavor I like (you might love it if you like fire roasted veggies) but I prefer hot and spicy and it was not so awesome. The rice was very good and my friends steak fajitas were really good with lots of accompaniments that had him digging in. Because his was really good, I'm giving middle of the road rating and advising you to get a meat entree as it definitely seemed to be better than the more bland veggie option.",

It's like they can sense when you're not going to order more and they put their attention elsewhere.   Other than that, I like their tacos. They're on the smaller side but they're yummy and only $3 a taco. Come during happy hour for cheap tacos and beer bottles. I think they have a Bloody Mary bar on weekends too if you're into that.",

He made our drinks exactly how we asked and didn't shrug at our sorta demanding needs. He even took our picture to help celebrate our day off! Even more surprising they have a lunch special where you can choose a starter, an entree, 2 sides (sorta like a bento box) It was actually really really good. And it was only $8!!!

Noticed there were a few beach cruisers near the hostess' station, and was told that each Tuesday, a guest wins a free bike as a raffle prize, and the raffle tix were free. Way cool!   Restaurant was packed upon arrival, but that didn't effect the service at all. Got a great seat on the patio, greeted right away with a friendly smile from our server, and got our drinks and bacon guac (try it, I dare you) within 15 minutes. Service was excellent, and our server was friendly and attentive.  We ordered the tacos from the regular menu because they just sounded too good to pass up. Tacos: I had the braised short rib, grilled shrimp and the fish...all excellent and the corn tortilla was made in-house. Tacos were all flavorful and  presentation was creative.  Stuck to beer tonight, so no Margs, but chatted it up with a few other diners that really loved theirs.  All in all, an awesome experience and a vibrant crowd of old and young just enjoying a beautiful evening.  I'm definitely a fan. Looking forward to the patio with friends soon.",

Everyone at my table thoroughly disappointed. I personally had the Chipotle Chicken burrito. If it wasn't for the fact I was starving, I literally wouldn't have ate past the first few bites. I've never experienced such bland food from a restaurant in a very long time and I'm shocked they're able to stay in business, in such a prime area, serving microwaveable quality mexican food.   SERVER: Didn't know basic ingredients that were contained in menu items when asked. Took too long to grab four (cans) of beer. Took WAY too long to get the bill and get card back so we could leave this dump.   HOSTING: When asked to be seated on the patio, the hostess sat us in the BACK PATIO (where nobody was sitting), not the front patio along Scottsdale Rd. where everyone else was seated and there was plenty of room. Request to be reseated at the front was met with disgust.   AMBIANCE: Try-hard baja feel. Woulda been into it slightly more had everything else been better. Random ass soundtrack playing too.

Ok, that was really the worst. But then there was also the very loud music, our waitress who was SUPER SWEET and adorable but who disappeared for the entire meal (so we couldn't send the rancid meat salad back to the kitchen or get refills on our water), the seriously oversalted chips, and the fact that the cheese in my enchilada was not melted. In fact, it arrived cold. The salsa was meh, the rest of the food our party received was meh, and well... no. I should qualify this and say that we're from LA and so we have a pretty good idea of the incredible flavors and dishes we can expect when we eat Mexican and this was NOT it. This is... wanna be food. Bar food, and not even particularly good bar food.  Not coming back.",

Had three different types of tacos (grilled Fish, Carne Asada and braised short rib) and they just didn't do it for me.  No flavor - needed to ask for limes and salsa to even make it decent. They give you tap water that actually tastes like dirty water from the canal and the house margarita is probably the grossest thing I have ever tasted.  Zero tequila and nasty sweet and sour mix.  Blah  Stick to bottled beer and you should be good!",

The manager agreed to refund the $20 when called about it, but we will not be back because of this. You should not have to worry that your server will steal from you when you pay your bill.

The previous location had a amazing service and a rustic ambiance that was not pretentious, but comfortable.  The margaritas were also fantastic and the waitresses so helpful.   Since returning this year I was able to try out their new location. I was excited to see the upgrades but sad to see the Old Salty's personality disappear.  The new Salty's, while very nice, goes right into the stereotypical Scottsdale experience that you can see across the street at RnR.  We went late on night celebrating a friends belated birthday and sat in a long booth in near the bar. The restaurant was not packed, but service was very slowly.  The margaritas we loved were not the same as before and not sure I would order them again on upcoming trips. The waitress was condescending and rude, but again we blew it off.  Drinks were slow to come, the waitress was unsure of suggesting drinks or menu items. She made us so uncomfortable we walked to a nearby bar to have drinks the remainder of the evening.   Happy to see Scottsdale growing and getting better, but am sad to see the Old Salty's go and make way for a less superior product.  Not sure we'll come back again.",

    "text": "Dining at this restaurant was one of the worst experiences I have had. First, one of the people I was dining with had an entire margarita spilled down her entire back. While the waitress who spilled the margarita was sorry, there were no courtesies offered her way except for a t-shirt that my friend repeatedly said she did not want. Multiple people were served the wrong food, with slow service barely seeing the server. Another friend was served a vodka martini that tasted like tequila, and when she sent it back the bartender admitted to shaking her drink with a shaker that had tequila in it and did not rinse out. The bathrooms were absolutely filthy, and felt like a hazard to be in. When the check finally came my friend that had been sitting soaked in tequila from the spilled margarita did not have ANYTHING comped on her bill. When they asked to speak with the manager, the manager on duty, Jeremy, audibly argued with them about their bill, being SO RUDE. He blamed them for asking for a free shirt, which NEVER happened, and complained that they weren't charging her for the drink that was spilled on her (even though it was NOT her drink that the waitress spilled). His confrontation was so extremely uncomfortable, I am surprised he has made it to the management level in the service industry. I will absolutely never be seen in this establishment again, and I will make sure to let everyone I know hear of this experience. This restaurant is so poorly run, it should be a huge reflection of the awful management. To top off the atrocities of the evening, the basketball game that the majority of the restaurant was there to watch, shut off on the televisions with three seconds left in the game due to the carelessness and inattentiveness of the staff. Such an awful and unaccommodating experience.",

The salsa had no taste whatsoever. Our server then brought us the habanero salsa, not even hot and it didn't have any flavor either. To top it off, we were charged extra for it.   My meal was a chicken chili relleno, all I could taste was chicken no flavor at all.  My husband had a chicken fajita burro and he said it was just ok.   Our server was great, kept our drinks and chips refilled.",

The patio could use a little over-haul in the area of furniture/decor but other wise was functional.  Complimentary chips and salsa were really good and they offered PB&J for kids so that was pretty awesome.  Food was pretty standard bar/TexMex food.  I will be back just not going to rush right over there or anything.  I live right down the street and this is the second time in almost 3 years I've been there.",

I sure wished I wasn't here for work because then I probably would unleash the poor shakled tequila bottles.  Poor, poor bottles.    I had the cesar salad burritto, which wasn't very good.  I didn't follow my  own advice of never ordering food which has a combination of foods mixed together.",

I've attended a few events here and they make sure they are fully staffed and everyone is attended to.  The food is just mediocre, 3 stars at best, and they have pretty solid chips and salsa.  But that's not why you go to Salty's... you go because they have an awesome patio, stiff drinks and it's a fun place to be.",

    "text": "I have never had such bad food before! I went there with a group of 5 for brunch on Saturday. The wait was too long at RnR so we decided to give Saltys a go. The service was good and the menu looked great. We ordered drinks and things were going well. At this time we were starving so we all ordered off the breakfast menu. When our food arrived there was something wrong/missing from all our plates. Three of us were missing potatoes, there was one plate missing bacon, one person had a hair in their food, two people were missing salsa/cream/avocado. When the server finally checked in us we were pretty much done eating. Oh and how do you mess up eggs!!! We order sunny side up and over medium and the yokes were COMPLETELY cooked through!!! Our bill came for over $100 and we paid and got out of there still hungry and upset. Things I would improve; I'm not saying we needed our meals comped but there was completely no empathy and no effort to make things right. Don't go expecting good food or quality service. Next time we will make sure and wait.",

    "text": "This review is WAYY overdue considering it's almost time for us to come back! We come to Scottsdale for Giants Spring Training. I found Salty Senorita on Yelp for the Happy Hour. So this rating is really for the Happy Hour (3-7PM). They do a few appetizers for $5 and under and then Margaritas for $4, $3 Well/Wine/Corona, $2 Coors, $1 Shots. Not Bad. The place was pretty busy when we came around 4PM after a day came during Spring Training. The waitress we had wasn't the best but what do you expect. The Margaritas are decent as was the appetizers. We got the nachos and another appetizer to share as well as a few Margs each. We just came here after the game for a bite. We had plans for dinner late in the evening. The Happy Hour ended up benign a good deal and it was definitely a great place to people watch. In addition to the inside area they also have an outdoor patio in the front. We would have sat in the front however it was WIDLY crowded. The patio was definitely the place to be. Overall, Salty Senorita is a good place for Happy Hour but I probably wouldn't come here for dinner.",

Loud music, pretty people all checking each other out, cheap drinks (oooh,  my head) and deep conversations that went more and more awry as the evening wore on.   The food is not Mexican by a long shot. It has the right names, like taco, enchilada, burrito, but they must have left the taste back at the kitchen or something. Bland and blander. If the food has little taste, salt, pepper and hot sauce are not going to do much except make it salty, peppery and too spicy to eat.   Drinks were good. Generous too. We all caught up on what was happening in our lives, and what was not happening that we wanted to happen. I prefer the outdoor patio in front by the sidewalk. The chairs are bar stool height, and on the night I was there the propane space heaters were greatly appreciated.",

The second our drinks started getting low our server would be right there to get us another one.  I've been going to this bar for several years now and have never had a bad experience.  The staff is awesome and every time I've been in, a manager has personally come to my table to see if every thing is satisfactory.  If you're looking for a chill atmosphere and to get away from all the craziness that is Old Town, this is the place.  Good work Salty's!",

Isn't this a Mexican restaurant? They had the most terrible tequila selection (or lack thereof) that I have ever seen and the bartender kept telling us they were out of everything. We had already eaten dinner but wanted chips and salsa to munch on..cold chips and sewage-like looking salsa is $1.99...fine, but can you at least heat them up?? This place was gross and I will not be back here again. Oh, the one thing that was good was our bartender. She only works wednesdays but was awesome!",

On one visit I paid with a credit card the transaction went thru and exactly two months later they tried to run charges for the exact same amount. My last visit this past weekend resulted in terrible service. Seemed like there was no communication between servers, kitchen staff or bus boys. None of the food came out right and when we sent it back someone else would bring it out 20 min later even though our server brought us the right food shortly after sending it back. Again there was an issue with the billing. Reluctant to use a credit card again we didn't have enough cash. After checking my bank account today Saltys changed the tip amount to increase the bill from $45 to $75. This place is shady as hell. If you do go here I would only pay in cash and I wouldn't go in with high hopes about the service!",
