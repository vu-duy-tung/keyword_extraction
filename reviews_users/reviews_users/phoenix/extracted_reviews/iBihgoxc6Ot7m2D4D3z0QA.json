    "text": "This was my first time here. Came for a lunch date over the weekend with a few friends. I wasn't really hungry since we'd just finish a movie (and a medium bag of popcorn) so I ordered from the appetizer section of the menu and got the calamari.    Now, my hubby and I have a thing where we always order calamari (if available on the menu) and if it blows us away then we know this is a place that we'd go to again.  Well, it didn't blow me away. Not one bit. The calamari was crispy but it was bland. There was nothing special about it. The sauce was even more disappointing. It tasted like mayo with some spices blended in. I know a lot of sauces are mayo based but this one tasted too much like mayo.    The service was okay. It was really busy due to the weekend crowd plus with all the soccer games going on.  Our server did the best he could do. He was friendly but nothing memorable about my experience other than my company of course.    I probably won't be coming back but it's worth a try. It is located in Tempe Marketplace so they're bound to get traffic no matter what. I'm just picky about my calamari.",

I love IPA's and they have a fine array of them here! We have always had great service, and their food is wonderful. They have what might be the best salad of all time here! It has Kale, chicken, yummy extras and a glorious dressing! I devour this salad whenever we go. Last time we went I used open table and we got seated right away, even though there were people waiting. We always have fun and leave happy!",

First experience was so good we went back for lunch and to watch a baseball playoff game a few days later. The Thirsty Lion has approximately 15 TVs and at least 3 were not being watched. None of the sets was playing the game, we asked the staff if one of the sets could be switched to the baseball game. Again this is the playoffs no ordinary game but no, they would not accommodate claiming every TV was reserved for football including lots of out of town games. The manager was barely apologetic. We were  looking forward to lunch and the game: we left  without both.  I guess the sports in this so-called sports bar is nothing but football when football is on.",

(Went there for lunch). We sat outside. Service was quick and pleasant. The menu offers a lot of items to choose from. So what ever your tastes are you should be satisfied. Thought about their Irish stew. Looked interesting. Ended up with their smoked chicken Waldorf salad. I was indeed pleasantly surprised.  The smoked chicken was delicious. Wow. Nicely smoked. Great taste.  Not sure why they call it Waldorf. Did not seem like a Waldorf. But it was good!  A nice visit. Glad we sat outside.  I do not think the inside would have been very pleasant. Definitely would not been able to have a conversation. So it appears the food is good. Nothing to rave about but nothing to complain about. They have a variety of drink options. Seems like a \"safe\" place to go and have nothing really to complain about.",

As for the food.  the burgers keep bringing us back! Prepared CONSISTENTLY with care and precision, they are quite tasty!  The meat is obviously of high quality - no fast food burger here. And the french fries are to die for - IF they're fresh! Choices of many beers, unfortunately, unless they are Happy Hour specials, the craft beers (like Mr. Pineapple) are about TWICE the cost of any other B&G! WATCH for the bargains!. Sometimes, the place is almost empty.  Sometimes a zoo.  We've had good luck at 3:00 Happy Hour. Had the flatbread, brick oven pizza once.  It was 'okay', but nothing to cheer about.

There is so much space that a portion it could easily be used for a private function or private party.  We had lunch here and was surprised at the small crowd but by the time we left there was a pretty good crowd of people inside.  I had a burger and a side salad and it was really made well.  My bf had a chicken sandwich and fries and he seemed to enjoy it as well.  A pro is that they had malt vinegar, which goes well with fries.  Our waitress was really nice and attentive as well.  She kept us well hydrated on iced tea and diet coke.  There were TV's all over the place and the bar looked like it had several good beers on tap.  This is a place I want to return because of the good food, nice service and cool atmosphere!",

It took a while for me to decide what I wanted to eat, since I had my heart set on that other restaurant, but our waitress was very understanding and patient. Finally, I decided on the smoked chicken Waldorf salad - apples, walnuts, and chevre cheese. My salad was really good - I especially liked the apple honey dressing. It brought the entire salad together. My husband ordered the beer battered fish and chips and our friend ordered the bacon cheese burger.  The fish and chips were good, the fish was flakey and I liked the batter they used. The chips (fries) were good as well. Our friend enjoyed his burger, no complaints there. Overall, it was a good meal in which we got to catch up with our friend. It wasn't anything above average, but not bad. If we were in the area, we might go again.",

Hubby had Huervos Rancheros which were good but not extraordinary. We were glad we shared because by themselves, it would have been too much.

The last time I was there I told the waitress I wanted the veg sandwich with no cheese and completely vegan. It arrived with aioli sauce. This is a huge mistake. Yes a new sandwich can be made; however, my meal originally arrived with products made from animal cruelty. She got the no cheese part right but it is not o.k. to force someone to take part of animal cruelty and have their sandwich arrive with products on it made using animal torture and cruelty. It does not cause less animal cruelty to happen to remake and correct the ingredients.",

To start we had the artichoke dip and brussels sprouts that were amazing! The brussels sprouts were so soft and tender and were lightly seasoned. The spinach artichoke dip was so flavorful and even had a nice spicy kick to it. My friend and I decided to split the fish taco entree, since at this point we were about full. The waitress told us if we split it we get an extra taco, which was awesome! The tacos were quite flavorful and I enjoyed the tomatoes, lettuce, and lime that came with it. I ordered the asparagus as my side, since the beans that usually come with it contain bacon (which I don't eat). The asparagus was good too, but at this point I couldn't take another bite of something.   Overall the food was fantastic and we had an awesome waitress who was super helpful & friendly! I definitely intend on returning to sample their fish and chips, since I heard that's one of their best dishes.",

More than half my sandwich was missing the chicken.  I kept biting into the bun with just slaw.   Worse yet, when I did find some fried chicken, the salt level was worse than the Salton Sea.  The fries were cooked unevenly.  My husband had fried chicken tenderloins with BBQ sauce.  He asked for some other sauce (like maybe ranch dressing) and the waitress could not figure out a substitute.   He finally just conceded to the sauce he did not want.   The chicken tenderloins were so dried looking, way too dark like the oil cooking tehm was not fresh.  He could hardly eat them.  The music was so loud, I was unable to hear others at the table.

My friend and I usually opt for bar seating; Cherokee is incredibly sweet and friendly--definitely ask for her section if you can.   I can only review this place for what I've had, so:  *Chicken Caesar salad--among the better Caesar dressings available in the valley. Dimensional flavor without overpowering the palette. My only complaint is that personally, I prefer hot chicken in a Caesar salad. That being said, my friend informed me I'm crazy for that preference, so like everything else in this world, it really comes down to personal preference.   *Brussels Sprouts--very good, and perfectly cooked. Served with bacon pieces and caramelized onions. Overpriced for the portion size, but a no brainer for people living a low carb lifestyle like yours truly.   My friend and I have decided to make this our routine meeting spot, so we'll see if the rating stands after subsequent visits.

The menu has a bit of everything, from salads and comfort foods, to the late night apps menu of sushi and other goodness. The cocktails are made well, and your glass, no matter what the beverage, never sits empty.  The staff is very friendly and has obviously been trained that customer service is key. The music can be a bit loud at times,  but it IS a pub, and exudes the pub - friendly, sports-oriented atmosphere. It is also family friendly and is never rowdy, minus the dude at the bar who yells for every flag, foul or touchdown!  Give The Lion a try...or order ahead and bring it home!",

It amazes me every time I go here that such a diverse group of customers can mingle, you have anyone from college age to senior citizens hanging out here.  The service is great!  My absolute favorite are the mojitos here, right now they have a Raspberry Mulejito, that has raspberries, rum, and ginger beer soooo good. I always have a designated driver so I can have three.   I've been here many many times, and all the food is excellent. It is really hard to have favorites, but I'm partial to the Bacon Wrapped Dates, Spinach and Artichoke Dip, Fish and Chips, Fish Tacos, ughhh I could go on and on.... EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS!!  TIP: Use Open Table to reserve a table for Friday and Saturday night ITS BUSY!! Dont be one of those idiots holding up the hostess or giving a restaurant a bad review for having a long wait when you didn't have the foresight to book a reservation. It's the weekend genius, it is going to be busy.",

We started with the Charcuterie platter -  Italian meats; sopressata, prosciutto, salami, chorizo,  pate, blue cheese, whole grain mustard, cornichon pickles, an excellent Fig Jam and Parmesan ciabatta crostini. Sis had a Tavern burger - big as a Venti - and she loved it; niece had French Dip, said it was Okay she's married to a chef and is a fine-tuned critic.

The service was good and we had our food in a very timely manner. As always, the place filled up quick around th 6P hour, but they have, I think an awesome wait staff. We had some questions regarding one of the dishes and its cheese content. Our server, Josh, without asking checked with the kitchen and came back to let us know that the risotta did, in fact have cheese and offered an alternative. And, I wanted to exclude the red peppers and won ton strips from my salad. Voila, my salad came without both. So, hat's off to both Josh and the kitchen for acknowledging my request. This was also the the place where my husband and I experienced Scotch Eggs for the first time. Excellent! We are \"young,\" I might add snowbirds, but plan to bring our guests to Thirsty Lion.

    "text": "On a friends recommendation, I came to the thirsty lion to try the Baja fish tacos. I sat at the bar during happy hour and it was very busy - the bartenders were swamped. The thirsty lion had lots of waitresses running around but only two bartenders servicing the entire oval bar which is fairly large. They could have used help! I saw a couple other people trying unsuccessfully to flag them down to try and order another drink. I waited for about 10 minutes until finally they saw me and ordered a beer.  The bartender asked me if I was going to eat and I replied yes so they gave me a menu. After that they were so busy and overwhelmed pouring the drinks for the restaurant,  it took them about 15 minutes to get back around to take my order. After ordering the fish tacos it took about 20 minutes for them to bring them. They were very delicious - wrapped in two soft corn shells - grilled cod with shredded lettuce cilantro tomato onion and salsa. Side of delicious black beans comes with it. 3 Tacos were $14 and the beer $5.50.  Total out the door about $25 for tacos and a beer. The beer was ok, but I could have used another - too bad the bartenders were too busy to notice. Maybe I will try try them again - but next time wait until after happy hour subsides.",

    "text": "I'm surprised by the high star reviews. Went here today with my gal friend for lunch with her six year old. The menu outside looked decent and there was a nice offering of apps and salads, so we thought we would give it shot. The place was virtually empty on Saturday at lunch time. This should have clued us in. The waitress was very nice and attentive enough, so no complaints there. I ordered the $9.00 pretzel with dipping sauce and a \"seasonal salad\" mind you, the main ingredient in the title being asparagus (small specialty salad) for $8.00 and my bud ordered herself the pear & prosciutto flat bread for $8.00. We got soup for the kid, 2 iced teas and I ordered a $9.75 glass of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. When the carafe of wine arrived and I poured it in the glass, it barely hit the middle of the glass. Lucky if it was a 5 oz pour. Chintzy. I did indeed tell the manager when he made his \"all ok\" rounds that they needed to improve their pour or lower the price. most pathtic pour I have seen in a long time & I just got back from CA. Nuff said. The food? Pretty dismal. I can eat a good pretzel 'til the cows come home. Alas, this was not a good pretzel. It tasted like a frozen Super Pretzel that had been put in the oven; dry, tasteless, cardboardish. My friend's \"flat bread\" was also dry, stale and had stingy ingredients. We could barely detect the cheese and the prosciutto tasted and looked like thinly shaved ham. The portion of toppings was almost non-existent--didn't even cover the length of the obviously store bought flat \"bread\". (I've had tastier communion wafers).  The salad came with two tips of asparagus. There was also supposed to be some candied pecans and crumbled chevre & grapefruit with a citrus dressing. There were perhaps a few pinhead sprinkles of chevre, lots o' lettuce and some small broken pieces of pecan at the bottom of the plate that were unfortunately burned. The taste of the burned nuts with the bitter/sour dressing that seemed to be flavored with merely oil and lemon juice did not make for a tasteful combination. The kid didn't eat the soup. Fortunately I was able to dip a few pieces of the \"homemade\" pretzel into this to assist with swallowing.  I had to eat something after getting drunk on that 5 oz's of wine, for safety's sake. I could have gotten loopy.  Unfortunately I received a text later from my friend after having parted, only to learn that she had already made multiple trips to the bathroom after her \"lunch.\"  To make matters worse, they were playing bad boy band trendy videos the whole time we were there. $53 bucks for some crappy, half considered food, an empty joint, and really bad, loud pop factory videos makes for a never again. Perhaps they have good burgers, who knows, but charging $8.95 for a dried out pretzel is pretty criminal in my book--so if those burgers or corned beef sandwiches are good, I shall never know. I won't be back; too many other choices in this big town.",

Our last experience we get there and there is a big sign stating the times of happy hour.  We were in the time frame so we were excited and even the host said it was happy hour.  When we ordered the waitress said it wasn't happy hour b/c it was mothers day (WTF) and the place was dead.  After trying to eat horrible food and drinking overpriced drinks we gave our waitress a $25 gift card (which we had received at our last experience after waiting over an hour for our food) The waitress came back and said there was only $20 on the gift card not $25 even though it said $25 on the card and we had never used it.

My only point of contention is that the staff needs to know more about the liquor selection. I specifically asked for Strongbow Cider and the waiter said all they had was some other cider. I shrugged it off and ordered something else. However the next time I was in there the service was a little slower (to be fair it was busy) and I read every single beer they had on their menu and to my surprise they had bottled Strongbow! Grrrr... However I love the food it has yet to dissapoint so I will continue coming!",

We did not make reservations which if you decide to try this place out for any holiday or special occasion, I will strongly suggest that you do. We waited an hour to be seated, which wasn't bad for as many people as were there.    Once we were seated the service was great! I really wanted to eat something Irish and I was able to from their special St. Paddy's Day menu. I ordered the Irish Sheppard's Pie. It wasn't bad for an American restaurant and of course I had to get a drink which was the St. Paddy's Girl made with Jameson's Whiskey, Bailey's Irish Cream and  cold coffee and was rimmed with chocolate. This drink was delicious! A friend ordered Corned Beef and Cabbage which they served to her cold (not very cool) that got sent back and to make up for it the Manager let her order anything off the menu and gave her the dinner free without her even having to say anything. As soon as the dish was sent back the Manager was at our table to apologize. . The service and atmosphere of the place along with the live bands made the decision to go here a good one. I will definitely return!",

We had two high tops pushed together and the rest of the group was at the bar. It made for interesting relay of the question/answer. The bartender seemed really nice- but for the people at the high top, we really didn't get service unless we got pushy about it or got up to get it. It would have been really nice if a waitress would have helped up our tables or if the bartender could have relayed with someone to make it happen, but alas it did not. So I just had one beer when I would have ordered more and didn't order food. You wait so long to order then you just get frustrated and don't want to spend your money there anyway. I stopped somewhere else on my way home for a tasty burger (not my first choice- the pizza looked yummy). Shame- I wasn't the only one at the table who under ordered because of the snafu.",

Even though it was in the bar at a high top table that only had stools without backs made it hard to do anything with my purse, but to leave my purse on my lap while I ate (I checked for hooks under the table, but no luck). Our waitress was lovely and attentive and brought us drinks and food appropriately. The food was a decent size (we got the nachos, california roll and spinach artichoke dip) and all very tasty. The nachos were the most surprising: we ran out of chips at the end and ate the goods with a fork, but the chips never got weird and soggy! The spinach artichoke dip had the most delicious bread and it was a bit different (less creamy) than others in the past. The California roll had eel sauce mixed with some sort of wasabi sauce on the side of the plate and was such a darn great option for dipping than the typical soy sauce though we did get that too. Overall, I appreciate their variety in styles of food and that they can execute it all very well!",

Their Nashville hot chicken sandwich is another gem on this menu.  I had ordered it once at lunch and the chicken had a weird rubber consistency to it.  I informed the server and within 5 minutes had a manager deliver it to the table cooked perfectly and he comped it from my check.

Our family stopped in during Happy Hour and ordered a few things listed on their HH menu and well, from there the whole experience fell short of what I was expecting. Our server was friendly enough; we just didn't see her much after our initial introduction.  We ordered calamari, sliders, and pizza. The portions were smaller than expected on all three things. No silverware/napkins came with the food, so we had to hunt down an employee to ask for them. We asked for a side of ranch as well. Quite some time passed, so we started in on the food. Just as we were finishing up the last few bites, our server delivered the silverware and napkins, as well as an apology. Still no ranch.   The sliders were good. The pizza was just okay. My wife wasn't impressed with her calamari, noting that it lacked flavor.   It wasn't busy at the restaurant, so we were a little confused as to why our visit seemed so unorganized: lack of a server, no napkins or silverware, and a requested side of ranch that never came. We order similar items at their competitor the Yardhouse during their Happy Hour and never have any of the aforementioned issues. At this point, we don't have much incentive to return to the Thirsty Lion nor recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "I have been here several times with decent service but last night was the exception.   I was excited to learn that this resturant had the immpossible burger on their menu.  Of course it came with cheese and 1000 island  dressing that were not vegan, easy enough to request they be left off. However  it was served on a brioche bun, I asked the waiter if they had a bun with no egg and dairy they could sub and he said they have nothing didnt go through the option. Took the other order at the table and hurried away. So I just had my drink and made dinner at home.   First, Thirsy lion had several other bun option I am sure that one may have been vegan, but they have no menu that lists the allergens available to view. Or at least I was never offered one. If they serve brunch they had likely had sourdough bread which I would have been ok with as a substitution.  Second, that one waiter was covering a fairly large section and did not want to take the time to answer my question or go through options.  Lastly, can you tell my why a resturant would make a vegan burger available on their menu and then not have vegan bread options to accommodate the vegan people who obviously will want to select that option? It not like they have a lot of vegan other options to chiose from. This is now the second chain reaturant I have attmpted to try this vegan burger at that had no vegan bun option.",

I guess I have always associated the area with family/college casual but I guess I need to rethink that after this visit. Decor is warm and inviting like any gastro pub should be. Our group ordered a variety of drinks, two signature cocktails (I had the Manhattan) one regular cocktail, one beer and an iced tea. We also put in an order for the poke stack, ahi tuna marinated in soy with avocado layered with rice (I thought it was good wouldn't be my last meal the tuna at least seemed fresh. Then the soft pretzel with beer fondu, jalapeno marmalade (wasn't a fan but I hate jams in general) the mustard/fondu and pretzel fantastic how could you go wrong? WELL you can if your appetizers arrive before your cocktails........The Atlantic salmon was good, garlic herb butter with seasonal vegetables and cilantro rice. The rice had the perfect amount of cilantro in it as to not be overpowering. I don't pinch pennies but I thought it was a little pricy in comparison to quality in some other establishments.",

It was a great size and could fill a small person but also enough to share. The bbq sliders were cute and also delectable. They had great flavors. We were served 2 on a plate.  He had some caramel coffee beer which smelled just like that. He seemed to like it. And another great thing was that they were super welcoming and wished us well when we left. Our server matthew was super attentive and had our order out fairly quickly, extra dishes for sharing, and kept our water glasses full. I wish I could have taken a picture bc the dishes were instagram worthy! UGH! We will definitely go again next time we visit San Tan outdoor mall.",

    "text": "I had a business dinner here with a lady that i met for the first time on July 7th night. I thought the people were friendly, the service was fast enough. I arrived first and they helped me to a table. I didn't really like the location of the table so I asked to be moved by the window since this business meeting was important for me. They had to check with the server to see if he would serve that table I asked for (!). I thought I did not need to know that.  Anyhow, the server, Nathan I believe, was awesome. He got busy with a large group of people later and a shift manager ( in yellow/gold shirt) I believe, came on to check on us. I thought that was nice too. We shared a calamari, she had chicken something and I had sirloin steak. We had the same white wine. The steak was a bit too seasoned but cooked right.  So the problem? Next day when I touch based with her she told me that she was sweating, she threw up and had cold shivers and felt super tired. I had similar effects but no throw up. She said she had more calamari than I did and she is a petite lady. We came to a conclusion that, having similar symptoms and have eaten together only the calamari we must have had food poisoning. I contacted a Mr Hopper ( general manger)  I believe, I got his name of online their website and was able to talk to him. He told me that he did not have any other complaints but that he would look into this and call me back. This was 2 weeks ago. I think he is dodging the problem, but I thought the public should know.  You might get good service, good food, but at the expense of your health. I would not recommend this place to my friends nor to may enemies.",

    "text": "We went to the Thirsty Lion since they are a sponsor or partner of the new Phoenix Rising soccer team down the street. The only reason we went is due to the way the \"Official Pre-match Party\" was worded: from 3-6 enjoy $1 off beers, from 6-9 there will be $1 specials on select beers. To a reasonable person, that sounds like beers should be $1 from 6-9 due to the wording change.   We showed up shortly before 6 and the place was packed--I thought it was due to the great special they were running. About 15 minutes in we were still sitting there with no waters or drinks of any kind. Finally, the server came over and we asked about the special. She had no idea what we were talking about. You'd think if you were having the \"Official Pre-match Party\" you would tell your servers about it, right?  She went and asked about the special and came back and informed us that it was actually just $1 off the beers from 6-9. Why would you word it so poorly then? Just use the same phrasing you used for the 3-6 promotion. Its really easy to do, arguably easier than changing the wording, and then you won't mislead customers.  I expressed my displeasure and asked to see the normal happy hour menu. The server said its in that menu while pointing to the menu on our table. As I looked at the menu, she walked around taking drink orders from the rest of the table. Then she just waled away after looking at me. Clearly I wanted to order a drink, I just asked to look at the drink menu.  She went to another table, took their orders, then started to walk away from our section. I had to get her attention to even place an order.   It took forever to get the drinks to the table, they were horrible understaffed. Again, if you are having the \"Official Pre-match Party\" you think you'd have an extra server and bartender working, but its evident that thinking ahead is not something the Thirsty Lion Management seems to do.   It took about an hour to get one round of drinks. Now I get the meaning behind the name, if you come to the Thirty Lion you will stay thirsty the whole time. We promptly paid and went to another one of the dozens of restaurant around the Thirsty Lion and received great service.   It was my first and last time visiting the Thirsty Lion, and I recommend you don't waste your time.",

Lots of dark wood and low lighting, but it's really difficult to feel like you're in a pub when you see shoppers in mall with their Barney's & Neiman Marcus bags!!  Lots of TVs, so you can imbibe while watching your favorite sports contest.  The fish tacos were very, very good. They came with a side of black beans, and what a tasty side they turned out to be! I don't think I've ever sung the praises of black beans, but these were out of this world! Turn s out the include some their IPA in the recipe which added a ton of flavor. The appetizer pork sliders were fine - nothing to write home about. The starter comes with two sliders, which was just right for a small tide-me-over-to dinner nosh. As for drinks, we just had Guinness and red wine - how can you miss with that?  IMHO, Thirsty Lion is o.k. Would I go back? Probably - but only if I was at the mall anyway; don't think I'd make a special trip to dine/drink there. The mall is a huge tourist draw, and my guess is they cater to them. I doubt there are a lot of locals that are regulars.",

This last time we came with a big group which we anticipated slower service but this was flat out bad. We made a reservation and got to the restaurant and wait 15 minutes to have them put the tables together, we sat at the table another 10 minutes before being spoken to, and waited for the server another 20 minutes to put in an order!! Multiple drinks were forgotten so we sat without anything to drink. We asked three times to have our checks printed out beforehand because we were on a lunch break. Checks didn't come out until we're were basically done. Haven't had a good experience here so I likely will not be back.",

My party had to find another waitress other than our own to go find OUR waitress so we could get drink refills after we has finished our meal. Not impressed with the service.  The food was good, but nothing to rave about. Average priced for the shopping area. The meat on the Kung Pao chicken seemed a little lackluster compared to other places I've eaten the same meal at. The chicken was a little chewy, the rice was strangely sweet which I'm bot really complaining about but it was a surprise for the plate... But the veggies were good.  Ambiance was nice for a real \"pub\" experience to an extent.",

It's location is perfect from what I gather away from the movie going crowd and food court area.  Standing alone next to Kabuki; the restaurants is super spacious with a large patio with a fire pit.  Perfect for the cooler nights and not a bad idea for the warmer nights to just enjoy people watching.  No not like that Inspector Gadget; no stalking allowed!    I like coming to the Thirsty Lion during the late hours for HH.  They have a great selection of beers and the food is pretty damn good.  I love the nachos here!  Extra crispy with avocados, beans, and cheese.  Pretty basic, but they pile that stuff on like there's not tomorrow; eat up damn it!  They're bar nachos during HH is pretty awesome too.  They call them pub chips, or potato chips so they're extra thick and you're able to scoop up the bacon, cheese, onions, and tomatoes.  The saltiness and crunch goes well with a cold bitter tasting beer!  Yum on a warm night!  I'm not a fan of the flatbread or main entrees so I generally stick with the bar food and burgers, which again is on the HH menu and bar menu.    Overall, pretty chill ambience on a game-less night.  They rock out on music videos, that yes, reminds me of the good times and reminds me of the best times! - Enjoy!",

However, if it wasn't for this last visit, this would have been a solid five, now, it's a two. Our bartender (we always sit the bar wherever we go) didn't think nor care we existed as warm bodies on this round planet. She ignored us, ignored us more and when she finally came over, she just dropped menus and walked away. The proper thing to do would have been to ask what we would like to drink and maybe a hello, that would have been nice. We had to ask to order drinks...AT A BAR, and had to ask to order our food. We ordered, no food for 27 minutes. Literally timed it. All we ordered was the pretzel app, ahi tuna app and the feature Irish menu potato cake things (that were awesome). When they finally came out, the pretzels were different than every other time we have came and the dips changed, or should I say cheese water and some sweet and sour plum sauce. So off. I asked about our cheese water as my boyfriend hated it since he wanted cheese, not watery stuff that was not cheesy, she said \"that's all we have\" and walked away. My boyfriend ordered another Makers and diet...never got it. Waters were empty and we asked to close out, she brought our bill back ten minutes later...he just handed her his card as we were done. She then goes \"oh I forgot your drink\" he said, \"don't worry about it, we are already done\" (twenty minutes wait time wise) she then said she needed to adjust our bill because she charged us for it but never made nor served it , but managed to charge us for it. This was not a busy time as the Cubs game was going but not near over. Bummer, severely disappointing for a place we love :(",

The establishment is very inviting and the food was excellent. Prices were well within the affordable level and the service was what I would expect for a typical restaurant. I had the scallops over a kale bedding. They were extremely tender and perfectly done. Also, had a taste of the sauteed Brussels sprouts, oriental chicken and the fish and chips. All were very well done and each would be a perfect choice for my next visit. There is ample parking and the site has an outdoor seating area with heaters and a large fire pit for waiting or just a drink. Nice facility and great staff.",

First I'd like to say that my wife is in a wheelchair, and I only mention this because it takes us a few minutes more to get from place to place.   My wife booked the reservation on another app, and we arrived 8 minuets past our reservation at 12:08 pm. They had already erased our reservation after only 8 minuets?!?! Why? Upscale places we go to wait up to 30 minuets before they cancel their reservations. Canceling ours after 8 minuets is a bit fast. So anyways, they get us to a table pretty quickly, drop off the menu's and we wait..  And wait... .... and wait....  At 12:31 pm we had waited as long as we could. Not one of the 4 servers we saw in our immediate area spoke a word to us. Not one single person said hello to us. No one even tried to get us water while we waited or even said they'd be with us in a few minutes.  This is unacceptable. Twenty plus minuets with out service or even acknowledgment is ridiculous.  When we saw the menu we were kind of excited because the food sounded good. Due to their lack of professionalism, the lack of caring and I believe discrimination against us due to my wife being in a wheelchair, we will Never return and will advise against persons we know to ever visit this place.  I really hope the managers read these reviews, you need to tighten up your service to guests and stop discriminating against people due to appearance or disability. And I am seriously considering making this a more public matter.",

Second, they do not turn TV sound on for games unless it's a Cards football game.  Happy hour discount on beer is only $1 off.  $5 for a 12oz bottle of O'Douls is very steep.",

Being ignored and poor service have a way of ruining an enjoyable meal out. I am not sure if they are attempting the team service approach at the bar, but it does not seem less or even affective. We asked a mail server to order food and he replied give me a minute and never returned. The two females were too busy gossiping, texting on their phones, and checking their smart watches to be attentive or even appear to care about customer service. We complain to the manager that we had received or service and asked him to refill our waters he returned with the waters and apologize for the wait, but did nothing to inquire about the poor service or remedy the situation. This is unfortunate, will not be returning.",

    "text": "Thirsty Lion started in Oregon and we now have three locations here in the Valley. They lean towards a European - American pub type atmosphere. With more than a dozen appetizers, small plates are the largest part of Thirsty Lion's menu which contains various types of food (spicy tuna rolls, nachos, pizza, etc). The drink menu features over 50 draft beers and wines by the glass. The restaurant itself is very large with a large bar and an outdoor patio. They are pretty similar to the Yard House. I got the NW Pub Burger (a Gorgonzola infused burger with maple pepper bacon, arugula and horseradish cream) and really enjoyed the toasted bun it came on. Thirsty Lion isn't a place for you to come to have conversation. The music is pretty loud and the bar area is usually hopping (especially if there is a good game going on). They obviously hire their wait staff based on looks. Because of this, I found the customer service to be pretty mediocre which is a bummer because food here is pretty good.",

Being our first visit to Tempe Arizona, we were excited to try the local Cuisine. I would have never selected a restaurant without first checking in with my yelpers. Of course, that's the only way to make a decision about how you spend your money when you're out of town. I would compare the Thirsty Lion to a Cheesecake Factory. The reason I do this is because of the ambience. The restaurant is a low lit and exciting place to be. People of all ages seem to come here. And there is a full bar! If you read my reviews you will see a pattern, LOL. I digress. The staff was very helpful and not reluctant at all to answer any of our questions. You can browse through their business page here on Yelp and see lots of dishes that they make to help you narrow down your decision. I didn't have any complaints about anything that we tried in particular. And if we're in Tempe Arizona again I would certainly give it another try. Oh! One thing I can't leave out because I have to give you guys some type of Juicy tidbits. The drinks are weak. They are weak and expensive. So unless you're a lightweight just save your drinks for another restaurant eat food here. Otherwise you will pointlessly run up your bill.",

She took our food order but not drinks. We had to ask another waiter for drinks. I had iced tea that tasted like it had been sitting out for days. Half of our order was good but the other half was not worth the money. We had to send back a sandwich which was just terrible. I want to give this place another try but we haven't decided yet.  There are some other places near this restaurant that are better choices.",

It was a fairly busy weekday lunch and we took a high top right next to the bar. The beer/cocktail menu covers everything and more, and I got a 3 beer sampler flight for a solid 5$. Can't ask for much more with both price and selection. After much debate over their very large menu, I took the safe choice and ordered a Pub Burger. It was heavenly. Good size, very filling, and just overall delicious. What made my visit a 5 star though, was the service. Our server, David made us feel like we were the only ones in the building. He spent plenty of time with us to help with beverage and food choices, and he really knew the menu and made excellent recommendations. And for a busy lunch rush, even the cook times were spot on. I will definitely be back to visit, and am also looking forward to seeing what their new Scottsdale location will bring!",

Not sure why this place serves anything sushi-like though when it's right next to a sushi restaurant.   The bad: I don't like the fancy sports pub atmosphere. The music is always entirely too loud. It's kind of tolerable if you sit outside but no one wants to be outside during the Arizona summer. I actually went back a few times with my husband and friends and I always find myself wishing they would turn the music down so it wasn't so hard to have a conversation with the people at my table.   Overall, the food, drinks and service are all good. But if you're looking for a quiet fine dining experience Thirsty Lion is not it.",

We had drove by Thirsty Lion Club the day before,and was attracted by the curb appeal. We decided to go there for lunch before I dropped him off at the airport. We walked in , and were greeted by the hostess and a server. Our server's name was Shannon and she was a sweetheart. She was attentive and friendly. We ordered the shrimp ceviche from seasonal summer menu. It was my boyfriends first time trying it and he enjoyed it. It was pretty tasty, however it was hard to scoop because it was in a small glass. However, we ended up dumping it on the plate and enjoyed every last bite. For our entrees we ordered a plate of Kung Pao chicken and a plate of Orange Chicken. We had mentioned we were going to share, and Shannon offered to split the portions up for us. She came out with four plates which we were taken back a bit because the portions were huge. It was very nice of her and the kitchen staff to split the plates and they gave us a large helping of rice on each plate. The food was seasoned well and was very filing. I had leftovers for two days, and it still tasted amazing.  There are so many different cuisine styles to choose from. Next time we will be trying a drink from their large and beautiful bar.",

Make your way to your table or the bar and unfortunately you'll be greeted by an arrangement of unnecessarily uncomfortable seating.  The bar stool while soft are backless and meant for a night club.  At the table you'll get either a cheap wooded bench or a wooden chair without lumbar support.  This is not the kind of restaurant that needs to force you out quickly so I'm not sure why the seating so terrible.  The staff though, they are a different story.  Be prepared to think this is your local dive because the staff will treat you like your one of 3 people in the either establishment, they're simply just great.  The staff will really make feel like you belong here.  Food...now that's complicated.  The menu is so much more expansive than any restaurant of comparison that you'll be hard pressed to not find at least one item that tickles your fancy.  The complication come in when there seems to be at least one awkward ingredient in each dish.  If you're not pick them you'll fare well.  I myself am very picky about my bread items and for instance, the buns and bread that accompany the burgers and sandwich really fall short.  They're tasteless flavor mops, whatever flavor you find inside of they're amazing burger is sucked out by a dry bun akin to styrofoam.    The drink selection here do not disappoint, whatever kind of beer you like they'll sure have something to fit your pallet.  They also have a great assortment or wines and an expansive mixed drink menu.   The Thirsty Lion Pub does not disappoint, well at least not across the board.  They're indubitably better than most in the area.",

I have been here several times and NEVER been disappointed in any way. Manager is always running around checking on the staff and food. Servers are attentive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend this place for everything from a romantic date to a happy hour with bros.  LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

On a prior visit, which was my first time here before, my husband brought me here for the happy hour. I liked it then and decided that this would be one of my hangout spots. One of the things that I noticed yesterday is that they have a special for their house margaritas during the hottest times of year here. So although I missed their happy hour yesterday, I was still able to enjoy their house margaritas at a reduced price. BTW they were good! So if you are looking for a nice hangout spot and you have never been here before, it is worth a try. BTW, they also have other locations in the valley as well.",

It didn't seem to be low staffed but it took about ten minutes for us to get an order in. Then another ten or more to get the few appetizers we ordered. The pizza was pretty good and was definitely the saving grace to the night. The calamari was a much smaller portion than we expected and the hummus was terrible. It was almost a soupy consistency, like something out of a can. Weirdly enough, I might try coming back when they are busier for better service. They just seemed lazy that night. And I'd definitely only consider getting the pizza.",

For beer, my go to is the fresh squeezed IPA, and for cocktails, I really enjoy the grapefruit basil martini. My friends had the chicken nachos, which is huge! My other friend got a Cubano. He wasn't a fan, primarily because cuban sandwiches are usually pressed, and they don't press their Cubanos.   They also have tv's, to watch the games.

Got there about 6:30 but before 7 for a party 5. They said the wait was about 15 mins or so.   There was definitely open tables as we walked the restaurant looking for the other half of our party; since we took 2 cars from the office and assume the 3 from our party were already there since they left earlier.  I went to the restroom and when I got back to the hostess stand they had already seated us at a booth.  Service and time to get our food was slow. I guess that was why there was lag time in seating us.  Food was piping hot coming out. My salmon dish with risotto was good for high end bar food. The salmon filet was not as thick as I would expect and the risotto was too heavy and the portion was huge.  The other salmon dish looked more colorful but the quinoa was too healthy. A carb dish between risotto and quinoa would have been better.  This is a small chain restaurant. They have 2 locations in Denver. I so happened to be in Downtown Denver and saw a Thirsty Lion. I googled it and they have 9 locations in total.",

Was very big, loud, & busy. More of a social scene, a place to been seen by the bougie crowd.  But the food was good. And the overworked and stressed waitresses did a good job of keeping on top of literally hundreds of diners packed in there.  Idk, next time I wanna watch a game, imma take my crew to a dive bar which is way more comfortable.",

It ends on the 27th, so get out if you can. It looked like some great options but we weren't that hungry.  I started with a grapefruit basil martini.  Good.  Not great.  Kind of bland.  But the basil makes it smell wonderful.  We had the bacon wrapped dates.  OMG!  This is a must.  4 per order.  Also had an ample sized arugula salad in the middle with a balsamic reduction.  And it was salty.  Hmm. For the main dish we had the seeded steak salad.  The picture is of 1/2 the order.  We had them split it in the kitchen.  And thank goodness.  But it was an overwhelming amount of leaves.  Very little of anything else.  I kept getting a gritty texture in my bites and an earthy taste.  So I'm not sure if they washed the lettuce very well.  The steak was seasoned well and cooked correctly.   Service is slow but friendly.  Good chance you won't get a refill on your drink unless you are proactive about it.",

We only wanted drinks though so we asked if we could it on the empty patio.  They have fans and misters, so hey why not.  The hostess gladly sat us but I guess there was some miscommunication between the hostess and the server because our server was pisssssssssssed.  And she made it known too.  I think she asked us at least five times whether we sat ourselves or if we went through the hostess.... Super lame and she totally made us feel unwanted.  The food and drinks are your standard bar food, probably a notch better.  Don't get the spicy tuna roll.  Really heavy on the rice - it reminded me of those per-packaged rolls you get at trader joes.",

They don't have as much cider available as I'd like to see in a place that makes allusions to being a UK theme but there's going to be something you like  to drink there unless you're so into beer that you need to see the resume of the brewer prior:)     Visited around 1230 midweek , 3/4 full, service good though a little rushed.",

They have a cool Monday pizza and movie special. We literally were in a conversation about how awesome the changes from Maria Maria's. And how we could come back with some friends. Seriously, we were planning our next visit.  Then the food came. I don't know if it was any good to be honest.   I was so freaking grossed out by what happened just before.  I asked a server for a spare dish. I saw her pick up one, make a funny look when she looked at it and then she grabbed another. After she placed it down, I went to move it toward me and my thumb squished into maybe 3/4 of an inch of a slimy mass stuck to the underside of the plate. I turned it over and it was a blackish something larger than the diameter of a smashed orange and nasty. I was skeeved out. I went to wash my hands immediately. Yuck.   I stopped to tell the hostess on the way back to the table. She sent the manager over. Our server came over as I was letting the manager know that I was really disturbed by the experience. Our server said \"oh, it was just lettuce\" as if I was the a-hole for even mentioning it. The manager said the only words I will probably ever hear from him as I will likely not be back--- \"So, we good?\"   I mentioned to the server after she came back that I did not think it was lettuce... she argued a bit with me. Maybe it was lettuce. Maybe it was some other rotting mass on my dinner plate. I don't know.   It bothered me. It bothered my wife. Trust me, it was pretty gross. We nibbled around the food-- I didn't honestly much interest it. Maybe I am squeamish. Maybe I was being a bit of baby. I don't think so.   Easily the meal should have been comped at worst, my concerns not marginalized. Instead, we paid the full amount for the meal. Tipped and left with food that hopefully will reheat when my appetite has returned.   I've written this review not as vengeance piece, but in the hopes that the staff can maybe adjust up and respond to awkward situations more professionally.   So, we good?",

My only complaint was there could have been a bit more of the cheese and crusty bread on the charcuterie. Other than that we enjoyed it. The server was very helpful on beer selections and could not have been friendlier.  It is a chain restaurant but only in AZ, CO, and Oregon (I believe). So for a chain we were pleasantly surprised. The price is a little bit high compared to other similar places. The atmosphere was very pleasant and the whole place is quite large. Did remind me of an english pub. Except I have never seen a \"Pub\" quite that big Scotch eggs were a delight as was the spicy mustard they came with.",

The pie tastes like left overs that got smashed together and served luke warm on a hot plate. The calamari was the most rubbery thing I've ever eaten. The manager or who ever he was took them off our bill which was nice. But other then his kindness it was definitely not a good dinner. Over priced left overs was our experience.",

    "text": "This restaurant is large and really noisy even at 4:30pm on a weekday. Better than average menu of starters, burgers, salads etc.  Not impressed with the execution though. Happy hour specials ok. Skip the hummus but chicken nachos are interesting..wish they'd shred the chicken tho or cube it. Instead, there are 3-4 pieces of breaded fried boneless chicken on top of the nachos.  We also had calamari which was tender but the white breading doesn't adhere to the calamari. The best thing we had was a pear flatbread. Pretty good. We will,give them another try. Maybe we just didn't hit the right items on the menu? I want to love the food because the location is so convenient. The menu is comprehensive and it would be a real find if the kitchen could execute all menu items successfully! They push a lot of food out of the kitchen, relatively quickly...slow down and work on perfecting the recipes of menu items! We will give it one more try!",

When I got the bill I was charged for the $13 salad plus a $9  side of salmon. She agreed that was a really expensive salad and had her manager adjust it for me. She was really polite and service was great, but this place is definitely over priced in my opinion.",

It took them a while to seat us and little whole for our waitress to come over, but she was very apologetic and sweet through the rest of the meal.  The tuna rolls are surprisingly excellent, seared ahi and delicious sauce that comes on the plate. On their seasonal menu they had roasted peppers with tatziki, which were also excellent.  For entrees, the spicy mac and cheese, and Romano herb crusted chicken.  The desserts are also very good, never been disappointed with the seasonal desserts.

    "text": "OMG I am loving this place. I'm starting with the food first because it was so fabulous it deserves to be the center of my review. Let's begin with the beer cheese soup. This soup will make you forget all the other soups you have experienced in your life. It is absolutely phenomenal. Thick and rich cheddar based soup with a beautiful compliment of rich aromatic beer in every mouthwatering bite. After having a big delightful bowl of their soup I chose to go a tad bit lighter for my entree. So I had their Smoked Chicken Waldorf Salad. And once again I was blown away! And by just a salad!!! They combine Field greens with juicy pieces of smoked chicken, cranberries, green apples, feta cheese and candied pecans to create a salad to knock your socks off. This place became one of my favorite spots in town with just a soup and salad. Mind blowing!!! I have returned many times now and have experienced culinary bliss time and time again. From their fish and chips to their sinful bacon wrapped dates you have a cornucopia of choices that will not let you down. Try this place RIGHT NOW you will love it. One more thing, I would be remiss not to mention the great staff at the Thirsty Lion. They deserve a whoop whoop too!!! This restaurant has it all!!!!",

I found a hard shell among my food that caused me to eat extremely carefully after the crunch on my jaw. The taste of the paella was bland and not a traditional paella.

We shared the garlic artichoke app and my friend had a cheeseburger while I had the enchiladas. The artichoke was perfect and the enchiladas had a pretty big portion. I ended up taking half of it home. Yay lunch leftovers! Their beer list was pretty extensive too. The star knock off was because it was really loud with all the sports fans in there.

I brought my parents here for lunch on a recent visit, and the waitress overheard us talking about how it was their 40th anniversary weekend.

It took about 30 minutes to get a table for 4, so I'd recommend making reservations ahead of time.  My biggest grip with the Thirsty Lion is that they don't put prices on the beer menu, which has 52 options. Then I come to find out my normal beer was $7 a glass, which I think is way too much 4 drinks later. This place is just not cool enough to warrant regular beer costing that much. There aren't many vegetarian options on the menu, so I had one of the few, the roasted artichoke & pesto pizza. The pizza was really yummy - moist crust, lots of toppings, good cheese.",

I substituted balsamic vinaigrette because I'm not a big mustard fan. The salad was truly amazing and I can't say enough about how delicious it was. It had me talking about it to my friends for sure. Everything was fresh and flavorful. The only think I might do is have feta in place of the chevre cheese because I felt that it would extract more flavor but it's such a small thing it barely warrants mentioning.

I need to check out their happy hour as it includes a GIANT chunk of their menu at a great rate!   Also they've got an agreement with the movie theater in the center. On Mondays, you can get a brick-oven pizza of your choice (normally 11.95-12.95), two non-alcoholic beverages, and two Harkins Theatres tickets for ONLY $19.95!

It's nice to have some personality with a server even if things are hectic and they have tables all over.   He was patient with us trying to figure out what we wanted. He even took the time to go back in the kitchen to find out what was in one of their sauces. My friend has bad allergies and has to be careful. She did not even mention that to him and he still went out of his way for her.  I ordered the steak salad and it was perfect. I am not even joking. Lettuce tasted fresh, steak was cooked as I ordered and they deep fry their onions for a topping. I was amazed at how much everything tasted fresh. I don't know what was in the dressing but it rocked.  My friend had the lamb and I think she died and went to heaven. She's not easily impressed with food either.  Her boyfriend had the burger sliders and they were lacking cheese. Only thing that would have made the entire meal perfect.",

    "text": "So, first off. If you are going to call it happy hour, don't just take 30 percent of the food off the plate and give me a 30 percent discount. that's horse shit.    $3.50 coors light  on happy hour? FU, coors light should probably not be 3.50 ever. thats a rip.  Lindsay, Lauren??? I dont know, brown haired girl behind bar. You have to be a TON hotter/friendly to give this bad of service and get away with it. I thought it was weird that my beer was empty for so long, so I went to take a piss and noticed it wasnt a special treat for me, everyone had empty beers.   While I was in the pisser I thought to myself, \"self, this looks like a pisser in a frat house\"   SO, I left.",

My wife and my step-son and I went there and deceided to try it because it was new and (the choice of a Good place isn't there) we were hoping for a good restaurant  in Tempe mkt. place. I guess we have to keep on looking.  My wife had the file megnon and it  and I had the steak. Our boy had the American Cobe burger. She ordered her steak med.,. It came that way but, it had no salt, no pepper and was not the tender steak that you expect when you order this steak. Slightly stringey and a lot of flavor.   I ordered the steak med. rare and I got it med. to med. well. By the time I was 3/4 thru it became med. well.   We were greated and sat outside, and sat, and sat, and sat.    We orded and got our food 20 min. later and my steak was med. well ( I ordered med rare) and my Wifes steak was as if it came from a discount mkt.,. The best thing we had there was a taste of the American\" Cobe \"burger that our boy had.   The plating was from the \"Flinstones\"! . There was a HUGE pile of mashed potatoes in the middle of the plate ( a pound or more), and the steakes proped againsted it along with aspargus. My wife was shocked @ the amount of potatoes and the plating! I guess it was to try and fool you into beleiving that the cost of the meal was worth it.   We won't be back. Where is Carlose Santana? He was over-priced but it was good.  We had a couple of drinks and our boy had a sprite. Around 90 dollars + tip. The tip was 5 dollars because we had 3 or 4 waitresses come by in the hour plus that we waited and at the end of the meal our orig. waitress showed up.",

    "text": "I picked this place as a last minute alternative to our first choice for dinner that was closed on Sunday evening (Lolo's in closed?!).  I was showing my British boyfriend around Phoenix and on our last night in town, we decided to try this place out. First of all, I'm glad it's labeled under American food, because the menu is most definitely not at all British. I came in with my family - 3 kids (two older, one 3 year old) and my sister-in-law who has been in a wheelchair due to an accident. The place wasn't busy so they were able to accommodate our group of 7 with special requests quite quickly. Although I noticed if our table wasn't available, it would have been difficult to seat us since the other empty tables were located a step up above the normal ground level (which would have been very difficult to get to in a wheelchair).  The menu was expansive, although the children complained the kid's menu had a lot left to be desired. Nonetheless, I ordered the pecan salmon, my boyfriend ordered the chicken breast, my sister-in-law the fish and chips (the only British item on the menu! No bangers and mash?!) and my brother ordered the fajitas. Fajitas were not available (ran out of tortillas?) so he opted for the chipotle mac and cheese. In addition to my own dish, I tried the chicken and the mac and cheese, and they all were quite delicious (my favorite being the mac and cheese!). I even stole some of the kids' pepperoni pizza, which is hard to mess up. The salmon dish was great, although a bit outnumbered by the mass amounts of mash and greens, but the contrast to the sweet pecan sauce was amazing.  The service was average, as we had a trainee helping out our table and getting a few drink orders wrong, but nothing that wasn't immediately fixed and forgiven.  As far as my review on this slow Sunday night, all things were good, but seeing some other reviews, it will be interesting to try this place on a busier night.",

Love Open Table... Plus it was one of the reasons/recommendations of the website. We figured we'd be waiting at least an hour elsewhere.   Blueberry mojito was sooo good. 52 beer selection. French dip and fries were really good. Husband loved the rueben. Awesome tender, sliced thinned meat and delicious. It was how Ruebens should be made. Cheddar mash potatoes were pretty good too!",

She was so friendly and more importantly attentive. This place was packed and she had several tables. She was always on point with her service and checking on us as she ran circles around the restaurant. All the while maintaining a smile and cheerful attitude. I have to compliment the Manager ERIC, he runs a great establishment. Our food was a little slow, not bad, getting to us. We didn't even have to say anything. He came over on his own, apologized to us for the delay and took care of us! The food was great but Taylor and Eric made this visit one of the best experiences I have had at a restaurant! Ask for Taylor's table when you go..she will take good care of you!!",

    "text": "Everything that we had from the Happy Hour menu was fantastic, and our waiter Steve was great! We were there for the late night Happy \"Hour\" (which is from 9:30 pm until closing) on Saturday night. Sports and music videos played on the TVs around the bar, while a crowd of about 20 people sang along with \"Don't Stop Believin'\" (Journey) and a couple of other awesome songs. These are the apps and entrees that I recommend. From the \"Happy Hour\" menu: Creamy Queso Dip (looks tiny, but feeds about 3 as an app) -medium spicy mix of cheeses and bits of meat with a small dollop of spicy meat & salsa in the center. $4.95  Grilled Burger Sliders (which should be called cheeseburgers) 2 to a plate, excellent, filling, with lettuce, tomato, pickles and a special sauce made of ketchup, mayo and a hint of horseradish. $6.95  Spicy Fried Chicken Sliders (not too spicy) 2 to a plate, with chipotle slaw, marinated in jalapeno & buttermilk (which you can tell, not because it's spicy, but because the chicken is juicy and tender), the breading is a thin, mildly spicy crispy perfect breading. $6.95  From the \"Late Night\" menu: BBQ White Cheddar Burger, with Garlic Aioli (which was fantastic) with perfectly fried onion shoestrings.  $13.95  Sonoran Chicken Enchilada Stack (huge) white corn tortillas filled with smoked shredded chicken mixed with creamy garlic aioli, cheeses...(it's filling and creamy). The plate comes with small sides of black beans and salsa. There's a fried jalapeno on the plate, as well, but none of tried it, haha. $16.95  Baja Fish Tacos - 3 soft white corn tortillas with sauteed cod or shrimp, cilantro lime slaw, pico, and Cotija cheese, with limes on top, and a side of Santa Fe bacon black beans (with a fried jalapeno) $15.95  If you don't read my reviews on Dining Grades, I'll just leave a quick note here that the restroom trashcans were overflowing. But, it was a Saturday night, and it would definitely not keep me from going again.  Great food, Nice restaurant, Fun Happy Hour(s)",

    "text": "Went on date night with the wife to The Thirsty Lion, Tempe location a few nights ago. My first time.  Wow!   It has a great atmosphere, I typically don't go to tavern type restaurants, but the bar/pub ambiance was fun and just cool.  It is not quiet, but you can still have a nice conversation with those at your table and hear the waitress.  There are booths, tables and bar height tables where you sit on a stool.  I am usually not a fan off sitting at high tables and chairs without a back.  These stools are so comfortable, probably more comfy than a booth.   We started off with the OVEN BAKED SOFT PRETZEL.  It was discounted for happy hour.  It was amazing but did not seem like you got a lot for the normal $11.95, but they made up for it with the quality.  The sauces are the secret to this one.  Comes with beer fondue, jalapeno jam & sweet mustard sauce.  The fondue was my least favorite one.  Still good but the other two were amazing.  You need to get the pretzel to just try these sauces, wowzers! I got the SZECHUAN ORANGE CHICKEN it was so good.  The only place that I have had better Orange Chicken is at China Chili down town Phoenix.  I ate everything except the chilies.  Lots of veggies, I probably did not know what they were, but complimented the main entree perfectly.  Sticky rice was so good too, usually have fried or brown rice nice change to have with Orange Chicken.   My wife got the French Dip, I had a bite and it might be the best French Dip I have ever had.   I recommend this place.  A Good value, amazing food, great service and a great place to just enjoy the cool ambiance.  I want to try some different items next time I go.   Added pics:",

The downside on this visit was that some of the food items arrived too our table not so hot. In particular, the Fish & Chips as this is one of their popular items.  Once I let them know, the staff quickly worked to resolve. I settle on a burger and it came out pretty quick. Music videos playing on select bar TV's was nice as it was the sound playing throughout the restaurant. I wanted to give this visit a 4 star (Customer service, greetings, vibe, drinks & music) but the long wait to get seated & for food followed with the \"not so hot\" food is why I'm giving it a 3. I will still return in the future",

Wednesday Team Trivia be aware that the restaurant will fill up and cause a bit of a wait if you don't arrive early enough (starts at 7ish). Whenever there is trivia, Happy Hour specials/prices are valid, and the menu is pretty legit. I really like the Salmon Cakes and Kale Salad, both well-seasoned & great portion for the price! Happy hour also equates to $4 wells, $4 house margs and some wine specials.   Service can be a little spotty/ hit n' miss. I've had it really good- attentive staff, always refilling my water glass, personable, etc. But then I've also had it poorly where it's a struggle to get water refills, order food, pay the bill.   If you're coming just for food, gotta go with the chicken nachos sans jalapenos! If my friends and I are craving some calories, we'll split an order between 2 girls as a dinner entree- they are just so amazing! I also appreciate their extensive beer menu, it appears to change every so often with a few staples.",

Gotta give them credit...the pretzel is rather large. The sweet mustard is not sweet by any means. It tastes like stone ground mustard you'd buy at the store. The beer cheese tasted like it was made with too much flour. The jalapeno jelly was decent but just didn't balance out the other two sides.",

The restaurant is very dark and loud.  Last time we went, there was a Foosball tournament going on. (Which people were very serious about!) If you're looking for a place to hang out with your buddies and watch the game all day, it's probably appropriate. But for any other occasion I would choose somewhere else.",

All were delicious! The scallops were full of flavor and not chewy. The bacon wrapped dates had the perfect balance of sweet and savory and were the largest I have ever eaten. The bacon wrapped shrimp had a distinctive smoked flavor that complemented the sweet and tangy sauce with the salty bacon. The prosciutto flatbread was light and well balanced.  Will definitely will be returning!",

The lady was a bit snippy in the way she turned customers down. She could've been more friendly. My friends already had a table reserved with 2 empty seats waiting for us. Finally after talking to the manager and having to show him the 2 empty reserved seats, we got to enjoy the ambiance.   The place looks inviting. The server made up for the poor introduction to the place. The server was excellent- friendly, quick, and responsive! Thank you! Then I had hot coffee with a warm blackberry cobbler. I thought I was going to get a slice, but I was pleasantly surprised with a cute individual mini pie. It was sooo good!",

I have had the pizza and cheeseburger and most of my visits the food has been proper. Drinks from the bar can take a little while. Came in at 930 on a Sunday, so it was hardly crowded and it still took almost 10 minutes. A good selection of drinks and more than 1 cidre option, since that's all I drink.  Atmosphere is nice, music on that isn't typical canned style music so it keeps the indoor atmosphere lively. Patio outside is very nice spot as well. Service is average on all my visits. Not encountered any rudeness and all have been accommodating to my food requests. Prices are decent, a little more expensive dinner price but when the food comes out well it is do-able. Great place to meet with friends without feeling like you are at a casual bar/restaurant scene.",

That is the main reason everyone was seated in the section my friends & I were... our server (Beefcake) came over for two seconds and when some of us weren't ready, he stormed off saying, \"I'm too busy!\" Um... what?!?!?! We were all shocked... we asked another server to help us & he was a doll! We promised to compensate well- we gave him a 40% tip at the end. Meanwhile, Beefcake comes back, as if nothing had happened??? Clearly the roids... I looked at him like he was in la-la land, others told him we had another server, and another said, \"Oh, now you show up.\" Beefcake yelled, \"If you give me attitude, I won't serve you!\" He then stormed off?!?!?! Are you F-ing kidding me, Millennial, self-righteous, entitled, A-hole!!!!! Manager was apologetic, but didn't seem to care- that attitude should have him fired; waiters are a dime a dozen. Good ones make bank & get appreciated, I tip super well all the time when shown respect & I value the profession, but ones like Beefcake, who roid it up at the gym thinking they're going to make it big on reality tv should be tossed out on their pathetic arse with the trash. So many places have trivia with great staff; shame on The Thirsty Lion; clearly management is lacking as wait staff believe they can screw over paying customers. I am making sure this experience makes its way across every social media & trivia playing site. Worst pub in Tempe Marketplace",

Not only that if you're going to touch/play with your hair, be sure you wash your hands afterward instead of picking up my food and bringing it over.

Immediately, we see a server with disgusting long extensions in her face and she's wiping her nose as she's carrying glasses to the table.  First of all , this establishment like any other should have servers with long hair have it tied-back.  Health code.  Well , this server heard me saying something to my dinner mate  about her wiping her nose and touching her hair , and came up to us saying this is not a self seating restaurant.   Really ?   How rude especially when we were told to sit outside.  Then the manager,Brian , Inept at-best asked us if all Was ok.  Well , no. Then had the nerve to ask if I was taking photos of the disgusting server.  Why would I. I just wanted to get out of there at that point. No customer service. Substandard health code with employees.  Never to return.   The table next to us witnessed this server wiping her nose as well and said they've never seen anything g like it.   Especially when Brian the manager thought it was ok.  Health board will be called tomorrow. Horrific.",

We honestly probably would have been full if we had jus stuck with that but the other two items were pretty decent also. Next time id like to get there in time for the fancy menu!!!",

He obviously credited the check and I advised I was calling the police, Attorney Gen office and YELP.  VOILA a staff ran out( as we were discussing with groups of customers outside) that miraculously the card appeared.  One of the staff on the bar side asked the color of the card and imagine this they knew the color and he found it in a completely different area. I was appalled that something like this can occur and the mgr expected us to just cancel the card.",

I received 3 nice pieces of fish that probably needed a couple more minutes in the fryer as the breading was a tad on the gooey side yet.  The hand cut fries were good and mostly crisp.  I really wish someone in Arizona would start a cole slaw school because these guys need it.  It tasted like someone poured milk on a bowl of chopped cabbage.  Completely devoid of any flavor whatsoever.  I give them a 5 for cleanliness.  I sat at the rectangular bar and could see the floors under the sinks on the other side and they were spotless.  The service was nothing to speak of.  I mean that literally.  If you didn't wave at them, then you went without.  Actually they seemed quite fond of each other.  Just not the patrons paying for drinks and food.  It was a Saturday mid afternoon, so the bar wasn't even half full.  One decent bartender could handle it alone.  All in all it was a very forgettable experience which I was hoping would be a good one.  I had a ginger ale and the fish and chips which totaled $19.35.  Will keep on exploring for that elusive awesome fish fry!",

First off, didn't realize how big the place was, had walked by it several times when at Tempe market place but its pretty big, has two full bars. So there are tons of places to sit. Which is nice. The place was rather noisy though, which was one of the only problems. That and it was very dark inside, hard to read the menus if you have anything but perfect eyesight   There menu isn't to big, but its diverse, a little over a full page of food. Their drink selection is really good, a wide variety of beer (over 52 beers on tap according the menu and select bottles/cans) as well as a variety of wines and cocktails.   After ordering our drinks, we ordered an appetizer. We ended up ordering Charcuterie. a nice plate of italian meats, cheese and bread. super tasty. we had ordered our food not long after we ordered our appetizer and after maybe 5 minutes of eating on our appetizer our food came out, super fast on cooking time which is nice, since no one likes to wait for food.   I ended up having the Chipotle mac and cheese, which was amazing, and my girlfriend ended up having the Chicken Penne & Gorgonzola Cream. she liked hers as well but said mine was better.  when the bill came the meals weren't that expensive but the beers were in my opinion way over priced, i ended up drinking Rogue Dead guy ale, which was 8 dollars for 20 oz drink, which to me seems ridiculous. but no biggie because i enjoyed my meal and had a good time,   all in all i definitely will return, the staff was good, the food was tasty and the selection of beer is awesome.",

Their beer selection is acceptable but not great. The bartenders and servers have been nice and attentive for the most part (although the last time, it took a while to get another drink). Also, the last time we went, the server messed up and put a couple drinks from my friends tab on mine, because we had SOMEWHAT similar last names, so she must of confused the two of us, but nonetheless she apologized and fixed the error.   We tried some of the finger foods. The pizza was kinda sad. Decent flavor but small and it was one of those pizzas where you take a bite and all of the toppings & cheese come with it, leaving you with nothing but tomato sauce covered crust. We also tried the fries which were pretty tasty and we loved the dipping sauce it came with. Ketchup is overrated, lol.  The decor is nice, almost has an 'up-scale' look to it. This used to be the home of Maria Maria (Carlos Santana's resturant chain), but it didn't seem to last very long. They have sports on a few of the flat screens scattered about and a mix of some 70's, 80's & 90's playing overhead.   I love Tempe Marketplace, so it works out that this place is in the same area, its just not my 'go-to' bar nor in my top 10. I will say the prices could/should come down a bit in order to keep the doors open and not become yet another tenant thats gone by the wayside.  If you're thirsty, it'll work.",

Service is pretty good, about what you'd expect for a restaurant at Tempe Marketplace.   My only gripe is with the kitchen. First, the prices are a bit high. Again, this is Tempe Marketplace, so I get that. The food, however, suffers from a case of taking itself too seriously. For example, one time we ordered the macaroni and cheese. I don't know what we were expecting, but there were like six cheeses, several herbs, and some kind of peppers in it. It was overwhelming and not as enjoyable. The same for some of the appetizers...you're marketing as an up-scale sports bar, how about something a little less ostentatious than the crazy potato cakes, or the pretzel cheese that literally has ale in it.   Order simple, enjoy the reasonable beer prices and great selection, and move on to a cheaper place if you're looking for somewhere to party.",

We tried Cadillac Ranch, and they turned us away with bogo appetizer cards, because they had a buy out. We then went to some Mexican food place, which had Horrible service, and A horrible vibe, so we walked out. Then we came across Thirsty Lion Pub & Grill.   Mind you it was late at night. 10 pm. And even though they were going to be closing in an hour (Sunday night 11pm), they treated us with amazing service. Our waiter was so nice, chatty, but respectful to give us space. Knowledgeable about our wines and drinks. And the food was absolutely amazing. I am a HUGE customer service person, and there are many stores I refuse to shop at because the girls/boys/ cashiers were very mean and rude.   We can not wait for our family to visit, as this is a new place we would love to show them, and take them to eat. The menu is awesome, but the waiter did mention to steer clear of any of the sushi, as their cooks are trained to prepare it, but not skilled. BUT EVERYTHING else on the menu is 5 stars.",

    "text": "There aren't many places at Tempe Marketplace that 1) Have great food 2) Manage to escape the feeling you're at a douchebag convention (Looking at you Cadillac Ranch). Thirsty Lion Pub just opened at Tempe Marketplace right next to Kabuki in the spot Maria Maria used to be in.   Sitting at the bar and looking at the menu at first glance, its a little bit overwhelming - they have everything from sushi to pizza to sandwiches to hamburgers kitchen sinks and lions and bears, oh my. But that's par for the course at brew pub restaurants in the area. I ordered a soda to start and wasn't impressed by how it was instantly flat. My friend was also not taken by how odd and underwhelming their cold water was. I eventually ordered a Green Chiles Chicken Sandwich with guacamole and onions and tomatoes and cheese; my friend ordered a vegetable panini.   Ambience-wise, the music and sports are not overwhelming to conversation. They play the usual generic easy listening rock garbage designed not to offend or impress you'd hear at any sports bar (Nickleback, Spin Doctors, Springsteen). The odd thing here is that the TVs at the bar play videos of the songs and these are big nice TVs and the videos are pixelized and fuzzy as all get out, not looking even close to hi-res and freezing up on occassion. This might be some video/music delivery service issue, but its noticeable and odd. The place is massive and can hold a lot of people and large parties and seems to go on forever.  Our food came out promptly and I was pretty pleased. My sandwich was great and the guacamole was awesome, not overpowering and not bland. It was served on a ciabatta that was a nice consistency, not too soft and not too hard and the chicken was great. My friend also enjoyed her sandwich, although it had aragula and they didnt cut the stems which seems odd. Having once been stabbed in the throat by an errant cilantro stem once upon a time I can say chop those stems in the future.  So, consensus, food was really good, we could chat and it was delivered promptly. Drinks were flat, but servers were nice and courteous.",

Plus the food is pretty wonderful (and with a great happy hour, you can't go wrong here).   With an expansive selection of indoor seating, you can choose to sit at a high top, at the bar, or at a comfy table indoors. If you'd like to experience their outdoor seating, you won't be disappointed with the several fire pits and lovely chairs.  The service can be spotty (previously Maria-Maria, they're still a fairly new establishment) but the great atmosphere and food makes up for it. Moderately priced, it's well worth venturing in for a drink if it's cold outside.",

I swear I almost had an out-of-body experience with the NW Pub Burger.  The staff go above and beyond to make sure you have everything you could need or want, but not in a fakey, I-want-a-big-tip way.  They seem to genuinely like people and their jobs.

My husband waited while I was in the bathroom for five minutes for the waitress came over to take our order for drinks.   She was terrible. When she finally took our order, she ordered his beer incorrectly.  She never ran any of our food out, the place was not busy to warrant using a food runner, and when she brought the check, she didn't ask if we needed any change and didn't bring change back to us until we flagged her down and asked.  Lastly she didn't ask or offer us any bags for our to go boxes.   After all of this, the food was ok, but overpriced. I won't go back.  I'll just wait 6 months for it to close down and try the next restaurant that goes in.",

We ordered the spinach dip, chipotle mac and cheese and the bbq chicken pizza along with a few beers. We were able to just hang out and not feel rushed, which made for a nice evening. Everything really hit the spot and we ended up having tons of leftovers too.  I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area and feel like hitting up a sports bar with higher quality food.",

The beer cheese soup has a smoky spice to it which was unusual but terrific. The scotch eggs were not what I expected. I do not like soft boiled eggs and in my knowledge traditional Scotch Eggs are hard boiled. They obliged me and cooked them through for me. They were served with a mild Dijon mustard that had the tiny mustard seeds in it and I liked that very much. During the summer they are running a special where you get any pizza, two soft drinks and two movie tickets for $20. That's a sweet deal!",

    "text": "Am I first? Ok, here goes: was invited for a soft opening. its bigger than expected. like 400 seats big. i ordered fish tacos (NOT breaded) the way they should be done. cod (iirc), tossed with chili powder and served soft w/ cabbage. however, my wife was dissapointed in the Waldorf chicken salad, which honestly tasted like cheap hot dogs. Processed chicken? Servers seemed helpful, trying to impress new clientele. food delivery was prompt, service from the bar was quick.   my gripe: if you are going to be trendy and open a \"gastropub\".. you gotta be different.. the 52 taps, many common names,  most patrons will see about 10-12 household names but to the craft beer lover, most the stuff on tap is what you could find anywhere really. I hope that more craft beer lovers come in to demand a better variety, and some seasonal/rare beer. after all, if you are just another mini yardhouse, why would I come in? I know that crescent crown distributes here, and they also distribute for the watering hole, but the latter's selection is world class.. and inside of whole foods, of all places.  food: mine was 3.5 out of 5. tacos were good - salty beans, seemed to be placed in a dish as an afterthought.   hers, 1 out of 5. that salad was a Wreck.   If you are in the area and want to quaff a quick \"mainstream\" craft beer, go for it. Not worth the drive if you are going to pass other craft beer bars like the Watering Hole, Boulders, Papago, Hungry Monk, Cuoco Pazzo, or Yardhouse (meh).  fwiw, during this soft opening you would expect the staff to work through some kinks, so this small review is only geared to help them see my perception of the kinks they could improve.   by all means, try the place if you are in the area. but frankly, it is fitting for the location.. a strip mall with a handful of mediocre restaurants, and not much else. i just cannot see them filling those 400 seats.  fwiw, iirc this is the third place that has tried surviving in that suite. time will tell....",

Sure there's other beer options in Tempe, but most are riddled with annoying college kids.  52 taps with mostly everyday craft beers that you can find in decent grocery stores, and prices weren't too bad for the 20 oz. size (cheaper than Yardhouse, thank God!).    Service was outstanding for me, with use of my name, handshake, prompt order & delivery of drinks, etc.  I thought the food items were a little pricey for what the items were, such as $10 for a couple of cut up pretzels with cheese/fondue dipping sauce.  Open and clean atmosphere was nice as well.  Immaculate restrooms!",

There was about a group of 6 of us and we all walked out pretty pleased, even including the one that you can typically never please. I think just her opinion alone was what helped me decide on a solid five star review.   When we had stopped in at about 2pm we were greeted by the manager and a hostess. They were both extremely nice and were very quick to get us seated and promptly started us with our drink orders. Drinks came in a flash and came with the menu. The waitress dropped the drinks off and did not even hesitate to hand them to us as if she took the orders. She handed us the menus, answered some random questions and was on her way. Typical me, I was very thirsty that day and JUST as I was finishing my first pint, over she came asking if i needed a refill. WOW! talk about attentive! After a few minuets she was back and took all of our orders. She even came over and whispered, asking me if I would like another pint in a few minuets with lunch. ABSOLUTELY!  My Pepper Bacon Cheeseburger came with another pint and I was as happy as a clam. The burger was cooked perfectly and was probably one of the better burgers I had gotten in the area. Kudos to the chef!   After all was said and done, fantastic lunch and fantastic experience, I was even given a few of the Thirsty Lion glasses to bring home for the bar!  Next time I'm in the area I can assure you that I will be back and would highly recommend to anyone looking to get lunch in the area!",

Server knew she messed up and basically hid until we had waived over the manager check on it & bring it out.  She also screwed up our appetizer order.

We were seated at a 6-top in the bar and immediately received service.  Thirsty Lion automatically got a good grade for me for having Rogue Hazelnut Brown on the menu. This is a personal favorite of mine. While the Lion brags of 52 taps, most of the beers are the familiar ones you will know if you like craft beer. There are a couple different types thrown in which is nice so you can try something new.  We ordered the Grilled Pear & Prosciutto flatbread appetizer based on the server's recommendation. It was delicious, but if there was pear anywhere on it, it wasn't on the pieces I had. Also, $9 is steep for an appetizer that size.  I ordered the Smoked Turkey Club for dinner with the Beer Cheese soup substituted ($1 upcharge) for the fries. The sandwich was fantastic - I will be getting this again! The soup was ok, nothing special. I'd skip it next time.  My husband got the Newcastle BBQ Chicken Pizza (added jalapenos) which was terrific. Dare I say it... even better than CPK's BBQ Chicken Pizza!? The crust for the pizza and flatbread is excellent.  The other choices for the evening for our party were: Pepper Bacon Cheese Burger (good), Chipotle Mac & Cheese (excellent! Restored my friends belief in getting mac & cheese from restaurants), and the Grilled Veggie Panini (good).  The service we received was excellent and our server obviously knew her stuff. We didn't have any questions about the beer selection as we were all familiar with the choices on their menu, but she was very knowledgeable about the best things on the menu.  Overall, good food, good beer selection, good service, prices are a little steep. ($6 for a 16oz beer!)",

    "text": "Came here after the Royals beat the Cubs to watch KState play the first 16 seed to make it to the second round. The staff was very accommodating and switched the TV we were closest to to the game. This game took place during happy hour, which the variety and quality was phenomenal. What was most impressive though is that the restaurant was not staffed for the rush that occurred from 430 to 630 the Sunday after St. Paddy's Day. Despite this, the bar staff (Bradley, Aaron and Cherokee) worked phenomenally together to literally prepare hundreds of drinks. I've experienced bartenders that have buckled under this pressure, but this crew knocked it out of the park and were very pleasant while doing it. They worked so fast that Bradley, the main bartender at the well, was running out of space to work. Luckily management knew when it was necessary to step in and help restock the bar and deliver drinks to the various tables. So props to them as well. We came here the last time we visited the area, and we will come here the next time.",

The music was good, the conversation loud, the food even better. The pizza is stone oven baked, I know this because we could watch it being made.  But we didn't order the pizza :) I had the Kung Pao Chicken and it was so fresh. I don't think I ever had it made more fresh than here. My wife had the steak which so tender. Our server, Derrick, was on his game. He was spot on with our refills and was quick returning with the check.   Pros: great food, lots of atmosphere Cons: the wait to seat might be long, might be too loud for some.",

We wanted to grab two tables as people would be coming and going to say their good byes on a Thursday night.    I wish the wait staff would write everything down because they got some of our food orders wrong.  My friend pointed out the pizza, but was delivered pretzels.  Instead of taking back the pretzels they said they could comp him with free soup.    The food was good, nothing great, but nothing horrible.  Great beer selection, but horrible wine and hard alcohol selection.  The biggest problem is the bartenders. I would expect them to know how to pour draft beer in a pub.  There was no head on the beer.  I'm not a big head fan, but the head is there to bring out the beer's essence.  I tried ordering a B&B for a night cap, but they didn't have it so I got a Grand Marnier.  They served in a shot glass.   I think this is the only bar I've been to around the world (I've been to many places) that served Grand Marnier in a shot glass.  Maybe they thought it was like Jagermeister?",

He took our order and never returned.  Another, pleasant, man brought us or food. All very good. I was dipping a fry in the ranch when I thought I had seen a hair. Hairs fall out.  Not a big deal. I attempted to dig it out and I got a hold of it. I pulled out out and it was attached to a clump. I placed it on the plate and it turned out it was an ENTIRE CRICKET, ROACH, WHO KNOWS WHAT. We brought it to the attention of the staff, luckily, my boyfriend was very calm and polite as I was completely disgusted at that point. I was ready to vomit. They brought us out new food. The thing that got us the most was the lack of a gushing apology. The woman who took the food away had a manager bring us the new food and nothing was said. Sure, they gave us or food free of charge. Thank you.  But, where was the aspect of customer service? What if I had made a scene? Would it have been different then? What if that bug would've ended up in my mouth? I just think they should've definitely handled the situation differently and certainly on a better level of professionalism. Ultimately, eat at your own risk. We won't be back.",

I do not like or eat either of these vegetables outside of Thirsty Lion, but they have not only made them edible, but delicious! Another great thing about Thirsty Lion (TEMPE) is the service.

Huh? I didn't ask for \"no onions\", I just ordered something that didn't come with the strings. So he was lying. No offer to make it right. Receipt confirmed he'd just ordered the wrong burger, with no mention of no onions.  The burger patty was good, but lost in a sea of sauce. The bun was a soggy mess as a result.

This is another upscale, bar and grill in a box establishment.  While it does have better decor, it is similar to an Applebie, Rubie Tuesdays or TGIF.  No soul or passion, just another one of those dime a dozen restaraunts.  Even the bartender was sub-par not knowing how to make a Mojito! Sad.",

We sat at the bar, got great service from Johnci, and she recommended I get the lamb burger from the special menu. It was fantastic, cooked just right, plenty juicy and the bun held up well. That contrasted to a lamb burger that I had at a nearby brewpub which was overcooked and dry. Very good craft beer selection. I'm still drooling at some of the other menu items, so I'll be back soon!",

We had something from every part of the menu  Pork tenderloin - Baja Tacos - Bacon MAC - Gastro Pub Burger - Smoked Chicken Nachos...everything came out on time and was really good. Also shout out to Tim...Hey may have been a manager but was great with our party along with our servers! Will return when in the area",

Went in for some apps and drinks, and we were pleasantly surprised that we were catching happy hour on a Friday night.  We ordered a few rounds of drinks, and scrumptious appetizers (sliders, Korean fried chicken, pork belly street tacos, and an oven baked pretzel).  All were served hot and delicious.  The restaurant is super clean, and the servers are friendly, and provided great recommendations on craft beer, and their favorite appetizer selections.  The only reason for taking away 1 star is the slow service.  While we enjoyed everything we ordered, getting someone to return to your table for another round of drinks, or to bring the bill was almost impossible.  If the Thirsty Lion can fix the slow service component, they would be a top notch establishment.",

The menu was massive, but my waiter was really well trained and knew exactly what I would like.  I got a burger and it was delicious. The portion size was just enough and we left very satisfied. The staff was great this evening though. I felt as though they were all very helpful throughout the entirety of our visit.  I would highly recommend coming here if you're in town and need a place that's open later that you can grab a beer and relax.",

Every server has been phenomenal. Management needs to schedule more people for trivia as the ones they do have are overworked, and things get overlooked. They also don't list the prices for their beer list. They range from $5-$7 and the server has to memorize. These should be printed when they print the menu. It seems dishonest. Management has made some lazy decisions that lessen the customer experience.",

I made reservations a few days before for a party of 16 on a Saturday evening. There were absolutely no issues at all.  There were a few people that arrived a little later than the reservation time but the server took care of them as if they've been there dining all along.   Majority of us ordered items from the happy hour menu. The salmon cakes and Caesar salad were favored. The few items we tried that weren't in the HH menu were the bacon cheeseburger, grilled salmon and the quinoa and kale Caesar salad .... all delicious.   I highly recommend giving Thirsty Lion a try it your on the mood for happy hour and good bar food on a weekend.",

The corned beef was delicious but we were not satisfied given the amount of food we got.  We had to finish our meal off with an appetizer which was actually more filling than our expensive entrees.  On top of that, I felt they were being very stingy with the amount of Guinness they were pouring us ON ST. PATRICK'S DAY!!  My black velvets were at least 85% cider with a splash if Guinness.  I had to ask the bartender to fix them.  No specials on beer or their \"specials\" menu (all of the items were the same price on their regular menu) and we had to pay a cover to get in.  It wasn't even that busy as it was on a weekday this year.   Only two stars because the food was tasty.",

There is some type of Cantina I passed by that did not look relaxing so I went to my Yelp app to see what else was around when I saw the Thirsty Lion.  I was expecting an English pub-like atmosphere and I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw the clean and modern decor.  I sat at the bar, a great thing about this place is that it has HH on the weekends!  The bartender wasn't that great.  He just threw down a drink coaster and walked off.... uh... really?  When he came back around I ordered a specialty drink - mint and cucumber cooler or something like that - I was hoping for more cucumber than mint but the mint was overwhelming, it tasted more like a mint julep.  They did have a great selection of beers on tap but I really wanted a cocktail so the next round was a jack and coke.    I wasn't planning to eat but I noticed some hard-boiled eggs wrapped in sausage on the HH menu, I had to try those, it's not often that I see something unique on a menu.  They were pretty good actually.  I can't wait to come back.",

There is one large bar a the center of the place that is open all the time, and a smaller bar on the left side that is probably only open when it is very busy.    The staff was very good, our bartender Adam was friendly and knowledgeable and the waitresses were friendly and helpful.  The manager stopped by and made sure everything was alright because my friend left some food on his plate, she was concerned he didn't like the pulled pork, but that wasn't the case at all.    The fresh cut fries were nice and crisp.    The cheeseburger had a great grill taste with no gas flavor.  The pulled pork smelled smoky and fantastic and my friend really enjoyed.  I had a small sample and it was tasty and juicy.  The Lion has 52 beers on tap with a strong selection of American beers (Green Flash IPA?  Yeah, it was good) but I wish they had a few more British beers and Ciders (Fuller's London's Pride or ESB maybe?).",

The $8.95 Ultimate Nachos could EASILY feed 4 to 6 people.  They were loaded up and delicious.  Even the chicken strips from the child menu were delicious!  The fries were soggy, but that's so minor.  I will definitely be back for either their Monday Night $19.95 special (2 Harkins Movie Tix, 2 soft drinks, any 1 pizza) or their Happy Hour.

The restaurant itself is spacious and tables are placed with wide margins of distance between them. \"Crowded\" is the last word anyone would use to describe this place, even if every table was occupied. I like that very much.  The waitress was attentive and did a good job, but the food was what really surprised us. The Tavern burger exceeded my expectations, and the bacon-wrapped prawns appetizer isn't cheap, but the experience is religious.  Wasn't terribly excited by their specials so I had iced tea to drink, but the prices weren't too out of line. Easy 4 stars.

I went to Thirsty Lion on Saturday morning for brunch with my boyfriend.   We walked in and the hostesses took a minute to notice us. As someone who's worked in the food industry for years, I feel like the hostesses could've been more welcoming and attentive with their greet.  We were sat at a table/booth to the far right of the restaurant, farthest from the bar near the windows. Everything on the brunch menu looked delicious but I decided on the Adobo Pork Benedict and my boyfriend chose the French Toast and a side of eggs. The Benedict was AMAZING! I mean it could not have been better. The jalapeno cornbread was soft and the pork was tender and sauces flavorful. It was a generous size with the breakfast potatoes as well. Delicious! I tried my boyfriend's French Toast, which was also impeccable. Soft on the inside with a little crunch on the outside. So amazing! Unfortunately, we weren't able to try any of the brunch cocktails, as we had an appointment to get to, but I can't wait to go back!   We let our server know we were in a bit of a hurry and she was very understanding and gave us quick but great service. We were able to be in and out without waiting too long for the food or check.   We will definitely be back for more brunch!",

Back in San Diego, I get flights all the time but it's usually no more than 4 or 5 tasters and around $12 or so.  Here you get SIX tasters and it's $10 flat.  Nice.  They have a very good selection...better than Yardhouse IMO.  I chose five stouts and a trippel and ordered the Happy Hour Crab and Seafood Cakes.  The crab cakes were just okay...I've had better.  I think the aioli needs work but for only $5.95 it's hard to complain.  Overall I liked Thirsty Lion and would come back to try other things.  The manager and both blonde bartenders were very attentive and the vibe of the Tempe Marketplace is awesome on a cool night in February.  A must if you're in the area.",

We arrived just before their social (happy) hour ended, and we ordered a few items: artichoke and spinach dip, garlic soy edamame, ahi poke stack, and California roll. Our server was on top of it and got us our drinks and dishes quickly. She also checked in quite a few times (too many?) to make sure we were doing all right.  Absolutely love edamame, especially with a good sauce, so this was delicious. The dip was tasty as well, but needed salt so I was using that salt shaker. My ahi poke stack was great, loved the eel sauce and the presentation was lovely. I tried one of the rolls and it was good, your typical California roll. The space was cool, I don't care for the pub environment since I don't drink but it wasn't overwhelmingly so.   They had some regular menu items that looked good, so may be back to try those. A solid choice for lunch or dinner in this area!",

I am told that it's in the back of the book (what book you ask? My thoughts exactly.). She talked with a tone as if I was the town idiot, but I went for a scavenger hunt anyway for this book.   I look around and found this mysterious book on another table and it says happy hour ends at 7...awesome. I look at my menu, the menu I ordered from says neither.   When I brought this up, the waitress was more interested in her IG than the fact that I got baited and switched. Her final answer was, \"ok\" and she walked off with her nose in DMs.   Last time I will eat here. Go Sooners!",

I feel that the calamari shouldn't be rubbery. I have had really great calamari before. In this case, the calamari was pretty easy to eat. The only downside was that the calamari was too salty. The breading was good, in that there wasn't too much or too little coating. However, the coating was too salty. I didn't like that.  As for the California roll, I liked it. It was pretty decent. The flavors were good and the rice was acceptable. I think it was pretty standard. The way they put the sauce on the side was unique and I liked that too. The avocado was properly ripe, which was good. I have went to restaurants before where the avocado wasn't ripe and shouldn't have been used for the meal. I honestly feel torn between 2, due to the high salt, and 3, due to the normal California roll.",

LOL  It's amazingly how when you are with friends, enjoying yourself, that life's little annoyances seem to melt away.  We arrived midweek around five, and this Thirsty Lion was pretty busy and ninety percent full.   No matter, the four of us waited our turn and were seated in a booth near the window. Nice!  We ordered appetizers and drinks; and more appetizers and more drinks. It was great catching up, and time flew by.   I've posted some photos of our meal and would recommend this location. They're not particularly fast, just good. Expect to pay $25 to $40 dollars depending upon how hungry, thirsty or chatty you are.  Ohh btw, they have a bunch of HDTVs if your conversation wanes, or your iPhone dies. LOL  Enjoy!",

I don't think these people know what Gochujang is... but that pork isn't it.  I was also told by my waiter that we can't change the temperature on the sunny side up egg.. So basically I asked if I could get my egg fried a little more cause I didn't want it runny or to taste like snot ...  This place States I can't have my food cooked all the way.. cause I ordered an egg cooked over medium or over hard.  Good luck for everyone who doesn't like their food raw.   Anyway, whatever they cooked the pork in soaked my rice and I had a bowl of Oatmeal in front of me..  This place used to be really good but they actually went down hill in two years.  I went in their starving and was let down.  The first let down was my salmon that was still raw.. they replaced it and gave me a new one, and took it off the check. However, two strikes for me and I'm out.",

It is kind of annoying to sit on the benches and look out at the empty tables. I will say that they have awesome edamame, and I am picky. Lots of beers to try. Just don't eat the Scotch eggs.

All delicious and not too sweet. We saw other people with nachos and the sliders- they looked delicious! Highly recommend!",

The Thirsty Lion's atmosphere is noisy and not very welcoming.  Service is OK, but our waitress didn't show much personality and seemed bored. The food was expensive for what you get, and quality was lacking.  We started with the creamy queso dip.  The dip was grainy like they didn't cook the flour enough before they added the cheese.  The chips that came with it were almost stale and had little taste.  My wife had the roasted pork cubano sandwich.  It was supposed to be served on a parmesan ciabatta roll but came on a sub roll.  The fries are not peeled, which is OK, but we somehow she got the all the fries from the outside of the potato with skins and hardly any from the center of the potato.    I had the GOCHUJANG BBQ PORK & KIMCHI FRIED RICE.  The pork was ok, but the rice was a mess.  I didn't get fresh fried rice.  It was more like a gooey mess of rice that maybe sat around on a steam table and turned soft, wet and mushy.   Skip this place.  There are a lot other choices, any of which has got to be better than that this.",

Noice levels can get loud on Friday's but you are still able to discuss business.   They have a menu that will be good for anyone and even gluten allergies.  They do a great job in this area.   The BBQ bacon wrapped prawns are a great starter, then go to the seared Ahi salad (split it with someone - it is huge).  Finish with the Baja fish tacos.     On a side note ask for the spicy sausage Mac as a side, you won't be disappointed.",

It was really really good and I would definitely go back for the same meal again.   SERVICE: the service was actually pretty terrible. Our server took forever to come back to the table multiple times. My friend asked for a straw ( I understand that everyone is trying to cut back on straw usage) but she gave a rude explanation as to why she didn't give us any then brought the straw back wrapped in a napkin (defeats the whole purpose of trying to keep it clean) and walked away without saying anything. Our food took longer than it should to come out and one of our meals was incorrect, again server nowhere to be found. I asked another server to get our server and she came over about 5 minutes later asking how everything was, then didn't even say she was sorry just took the plate away. I could continue to go on about how poor the service was but unfortunately it was mainly the server and it's hard for me to fault the whole restaurant for it.   AMBIANCE: restaurant is very busy for lunch time, could have affected the service. I like the vibes though.   Would still give this place a try for a casual dining experience, just hope you get a different server.",

We stopped in during a weekday and there was good music and the lights were dimmed and people were just hanging out eating and drinking and having a good time. The menu is different during the later hours but still a lot of very good choices. They have a white cheddar burger and it was probably one of the best I have ever had. It was just delicious ( I had one again a few days later..shhhhhh, our secret) and also tried their chipotle mac and cheese and it was fattening and yummy as could be. they have a pretty decent beer selection although not as crafty as some other places like Hungry Monk or Topps but still a good craft selection. Its huge inside and outside and more than enough room and space to get a good table or seat at the bar. Highly suggest checking it out, very good addition to Tempe.  side note: they let me add a fried egg to my burger- which immediately chalked up their awesomeness- yes awesomeness.",

    "text": "I once came here for my friend's bday dinner and got excited when checking out their beer menu. If you like beer like me, then you may get giddy. It kinda reminds me of a lesser known Yardhouse. It's got a huge beer menu and also an equally lengthy food menu (which I think can be a downside sometimes).   Anyhoo, this place is huge with a decent size bar in the center and decorations that make it look like a futbol/soccer pub. They also got big screen LCD TVs all around the bar to watch sports, but if you're sitting at the dining area, you may not get a good glimpse of it depending on location.   The service was good and we had some happy hour menu items which seemed to consist of the usual HH items like nachos, calamari, small pizzas, etc. (you know what I mean) As for the main course, I had the kobe beef burger which was ok. I felt like it could have been spiced up a little bit with a different cheese or toppings, but oh well. Maybe i'll try another dish next time and see.   The HH prices were quite decent, but main entrees can get pretty pricey for a pub and grill sorta place.",

The Veggie Panini, Caprese Chicken Sandwich or any of the flatbreads are my favorite. I always get a side of ranch if I get fries, the peppercorn ranch is awesome! Lots of TVs for game viewing, and a really nice patio space. One of the better restaurants in Tempe Marketplace, worth checking out!",

Our servers have always been nice and helpful, even though it is a busy place so naturally it can be a little loud or take a while to get your food, but that's kind of expected considering its location and size. I like the atmosphere a lot, too. The only thing that drives me crazy is how a decent number of the tables have stools instead of chairs with backs. Maybe it's just me, but it's hard for me to relax if the chair doesn't have a back (unless I'm at the bar of course). Nice place, though.",

I looked at the menu online and figured with the variety of sandwiches, salads, pizzas and entrees this would be a safe bet. Luckily I was right.  We sat outside because the weather was perfect. The atmosphere was nice. Nice lighting, comfortable tables and we were right by a big firepit that was pretty cool. Even though it's at a \"mall\" it didn't feel like it.  A couple of us ordered salads and a couple ordered fish and chips. I got the chicken waldorf salad which was huge. All the portions were huge, actually. The lettuce was crisp, the dressing wasn't too overpowering and there were big chunks of chicken, apples and walnuts. I could have easily done with a half order - they should consider that. :) My family members really enjoyed their entrees as well. My aunt cleared her plate of fish and chips!  Overall it was a great choice. If you're looking for solid \"American\" food that is a step up from greasy bar food this is a good option.",

    "text": "A bar and restaurant opened at Tempe Marketplace that differentiates itself from the typical outdoor mall chains-Thirsty Lion Pub and Grill, the first location in Arizona with only two additional ones in Oregon. The Thirsty Lion is populated with sexy female servers in cute outfits and has an extensive menu of pub fare and 52 draft beers.   I had soup and salad for lunch, with a garden salad and beer cheese soup ($8.95). This was my first time trying this kind of soup, and while it was probably made well, the beer taste was a little overwhelming for me. Don't order this unless you're a huge fan of beer.  My salad was great and came with cucumber, carrot, red pepper, onion and croutons. The portion was generous, and the greens were leafy, and as far as soup and salad at sports bars go, this combo was one of the best I've had based on the portion and ingredients.  My pal tried the Southwest Smoked Chicken Salad ($11.95), which was also an enormous portion and looked mighty tasty.  There were a ton of other menu items that made me salivate, and I wish I could have tried them all. If I go back, I'm going to have to decide between the brick oven pizzas, the ultimate nachos and the chipotle mac and cheese. Everything sounded really great, and the service was friendly, too.  If you don't want to sit on the patio, the dark interior features lots of sports televisions and a masculine atmosphere of wood furnishings. The place reminded me a little of D'Arcy McGee's, so if you're on the other end of Tempe Marketplace, you have another option for pub fare.",

The bartenders are always nice and helpful. The few times that I've had a waiter, I haven't received the same type of service. It's taken around 7 minutes just to get a menu. There have been numerous times where I've asked for steak sauce or other miscellaneous items and it has taken 15 minutes to get them. There was a time where I didn't receive it at all and after waiting 15 minutes after receiving my food, I just decided to go to the bar and ask them. I'd understand if the place was busy, but the times that these occurrences happened, wasn't busy at all.   So all-in-all, Thirsty Lion should be a 3rd option for going out.",

    "text": "So I was meeting some friends here last night for drinks for a friend's birthday. We were supposed to meet at 9:30 but it was around 10:30 when we actually got to the bar. We walked in and had our IDs checked and then stood around awkwardly...I'm not sure why this happened, but after a few minutes we were asked if we needed a table. Yup...that's why we're here. So we were seated near the bar. The place is large and the decor is fine, but the music they were playing was mainly from the 90's and made the place seem less 'hip' I guess, not that I know much about being hip. We waited for about 5 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us. The waiter finally came by and took our drink order. I got the agave basil margarita ($8.50) which was soooo good! I was very happy with the drink. The Birthday Girl got a blueberry bliss... which wasn't what she was expecting. I tried it and thought it was good, but it was definitely more like wine than a mixed drink. The others got beers.   So the real problem, for me at least, was my second drink. I got a tropical margarita ($7.00). It was one of the worst drinks I have ever had and was a challenge to drink. It was SO acidic and just nasty, I swear the two drinks could not have come from the same place...but they did. That's a huge red flag for me.  Side note: Why do restaurants think it's cool to not price their signature drinks....why should I have to ask how much it costs? I find this completely ridiculous and annoying. The drinks didn't end up being very expensive here, but I feel like I should have that information available to me on the menu just like any other item.... *ok steps off soapbox*  As far as food goes, one of my friends got a side of fries that were pretty good and came with bbq sauce, but other than that we did not eat. I have heard good things about their food from other people.   After we were done with our second round of drinks (and the fries) we decided to move on to another bar.....but we couldn't because we had no check! Our waiter, who had been almost harassing us towards the beginning of our night, had completely disappeared. He finally came by like 10-15 minutes later and reeked of cigarettes....there is no way he only smoked one because I could almost taste it...pretty gross for a waiter. Anyway, our checks were brought fairly quickly after that and we were finally able to leave.    Conclusion: Be very careful what you order....it is a total mixed bag.",

There was some trouble at the bar, as we wanted to order dinner from the bar.  One bartender said he'd take our order then promptly left for a really long time - like we didn't see him again for 20 minutes.  In the meantime we tried another bartender.  He confessed he was a barback and wasn't clued in on the menu.  The same happened with another person behind the bar.  We were in the process of getting up to go elsewhere for dinner when Star took the reins.  She assured us she would take control of the disorder and fix everything.  My friend ordered the sirloin with asparagus, and she said it was really good.  I ordered the grilled salmon with seasonal greens and the salmon was extraordinarily good.  Cooked to perfection and served hot off the grill.  This was an example of somebody (Star) noticing a failure in progress and successfully saving it.  I didn't give them a 5 star because I got a discount - there was no discount - the rating is based on the service I ended up receiving, the quality of the atmosphere, and the outstanding food and beverages.  I'll be returning soon.",

Because it's situated just off the 101 and 202 freeways, it's very convenient for meeting someone halfway between 2 distant cities in the Phoenix area.  I've setup lunch meetings and happy hour get togethers here....it seems to work well for us.  I've tried the following menu items:  Pepper Bacon Cheeseburger - $11.50 Sliders - $8.95 Ultimate Nachos - $9.95  Out of the group, my favs are the Nachos and the Cheeseburger.  The Nachos are pretty large and can easily feed 2 people....although I took care of them by myself, ha!  The Pepper Bacon Cheeseburger is full of flavor and the spice from the Pepper on the Bacon compliments the juicy Burger very well.  The Sliders are pretty good as well.  It's a good lunchtime option.  There's plenty of parking at the mall and it's conveniently located at the West end of the mall, so you don't have to walk around too much to get there.

I decided to go with the soup and sandwich combo. I went with a recommendation that the waitress made of their famous cheese and beer soup, and the mediterranean chicken sandwich. The soup was absolutely awesome. I have never had anything quite like it. (Thats saying a lot because i love soup) It had a great flavor but neither the beer or cheese was dominate or overpowering. I would go back solely for the soup haha. The sandwich was good as well, but nothing over the top.  My friend went with the caesar salad and sliders. The salad was basic, no frills with ceased, and she said the sliders were very good.  Overall we both liked this spot. Nice atmosphere, friendly service, and bonus points for being open late.",

That is the best thing I can say about it, is that it is convenient to grab a beer before the game. The service was dreadful and the food was very average.

The host said it would be about 10 mins until a server arrived since they were at a change over time!!! Seriously?? It was after 3:30 before we got a server and another beer!! And the place was NOT busy!! Needless to say we will find another place to meet for a beer the next time we come to spring training!",

The lion lemonade is delicious! They have a few other \"girly\" drinks on their happy hour menu that are good. Pretty much every drink we try is good.  Pros: -Sliders -Pizza -Mixed drinks -happy hour and REVERSE happy hour - good deals! -Clean and updated  Cons: -During the week they close at 11p or 12a, they don't have bar hours",

On a Tuesday!   One night we were out and thought we would give it a second chance. Bad choice! We waited at the door for 15 minutes before someone came to seat us. Once we were seated, We had to ask the bartender twice to send our server to our table so we could order. Server came to our table about 20 minutes after we sat down (as we were gathering out belongings to leave) an took out whole order. The food came out undercooked and cold before we even got our beers. Again, we waited forever for our bill.  We will never EVER go back.",

I ordered a Kona Longboard Ale (Haven't seen that brand on tap in months) and with a group, we split the Happy Hour appetizers. --Scotch eggs were pretty amazing. --I wish we had more chicken strips, but the dipping sauces were amazing (the ranch especially after we got fries as well) --I highly recommend the edamame.  It's very flavorful  We were well-attended by the staff and the food was delivered efficiently and in perfect temperature.  I don't look for things to complain about, so I didn't find anything wrong with this place.  It has a very nice modern, classy look to it.  FIVE STARS!",

If I were just going in for a beer and some cheap eats during happy hour or reverse happy hour, I may have have loved Thirsty Lion.  But just stopping in for a meal, not so great.  I had the Green Chii Chicken Sandwich.  Not bad.  Just nothing special.  Slightly messier and soggy than I would like my sandwiches to be.  My Fiance had the Southwest Chicken Salad.  Horrible.  The salad was big and looked nice.  But it was mostly cabbage, the chicken tasted like a bag of sliced tyson chicken from the grocery store, the corn was nearly impossible to find, and the avocado didn't taste ripe.  It was almost as much of punishment for me to watch her pick through it as it must have been for her to eat it.  The dressing that came with the salad was fantastic.",

The food was good for bar food and the service was great.  It's a REALLY  big place which is great and they have an amazing selection of beer and food.

This is pretty stomach turning than goodness I'm not a germaphobe or it would have been all over for me.  I tried to get over it but the whole time I was eating I just was wondering how could you not notice a big black stain on a small app plate?    The food was tasty, a twist on bar food.  We had the bbq wrapped prawns, french dip and fries and I had a pom and goat cheese salad.  The food was good however, it left us with upset stomachs all night.  All in all I will probably never go back, which kinda sucks but there are too many places especially in Tempe Marketplace to pay for such a disappointing and slightly disgusting experience.",

    "text": "Goodness, how did we end up here? We were at this mall in Tempe attending a disappointing Road Runner Sports event and found ourselves starving and smelling something delicious in the air. We walked up and down the mall looking for someplace that could accommodate the newly vegan husband and somewhat picky kids. Sushi looked good but not for kids. California Pizza too many carbs. Mexican joint to busy and bar like. Cadillac Ranch no, been there before. Some Chinese place no beer, it is Friday night damn it. Smash Burger? Little one and vegan nixed that. Back to the Thirsty Lion - I think the thought of beer and no line settled it. Live and Learn. Live and Learn...  So we were seated right away, in the bar basically. Approached by our waitress, she was brusk but helpful. We order beer and soda (it's Friday people!) and the edamame appetizer. She brings the sodas. Another woman brings one beer. I mention we ordered two she looks surprised and says cheerfully \"It's on it's way!!\".  Um, no. I see our waitress passing by I mention we only received one beer. Okay. She goes and gets it. Edamame comes right away. YUM. It was spicy, garlicky, salty goodness. We should have stopped there but no, we pressed on.   I order the steak salad, she asks: how do you like your steak cooked? I respond: medium rare. The little voice in my head says \" You should ask what cut of meat it is\" Shush Voice, I'm getting meat! I say in my head back. My husband orders the closest thing he can find to vegan food: a veggie panini but asks No CHEESE. She says okay and writes it down, I watched. Little one orders off the kid's menu: mac and cheese. Big boy orders Fish and Chips.   We are happily eating our edamame and watching the Tempe Mall groupies doing their thing. I decide to visit the ladies room and this is a huge place so I set out in the most logical direction. I run into our waitress and ask, Where's the ladies room? She was so sweet she actually walked me most of the way there! Great service! I was impressed. The restroom is just around the corner of the pizza making guys. I thought I should have ordered pizza. Yummy looking.   I get back and the food is delivered. Where do I start? Steak Salad: meat was rare and tough. It should have been cooked more. The salad greens were fresh, red pepper good, onions too strong, dressing was nice and not too much. They put chimichurri sauce on the steak. It was over powered with thyme or marjoram. Too flowery and I've cooked with chimichurri and like it. But what was awful was the gristle. Made most of it inedible.   Little kid: his mac and cheese was fancy so of course he didn't like it. So I quickly ordered him french fries and then they were crazy salty so he didn't eat those either. Luckily (?) the waitress was generous with the soda. Big kid: very much enjoyed the fish and chips. I tried them - a bit fishy but the best thing on the table!  Now let's go vegan shall we? So immediately my husband takes a bite - into cheese. And stops eating. He looks through his sandwich plenty of provolone and mozzarella. A few minutes later the waitress comes by and asks if he is done, he says yes because there is cheese on the sandwich, she says sorry and walks away with the sandwich. We look at each other and say how is this going to turn out? So my husband sits there with no food while we eat. He eats a couple of french fries, we finish and she comes back with the check. For the full bill of 76.51 including the panini. Really???? Really.   She comes to collect and we ask about the sandwich and she demands: What do you want?? What do you want? My husband says I would have liked to have eaten with my family. She says: Would you like another sandwich? He says everyone is done eating. She says I'll bring you one to go! He says okay. A few minutes later she brings the sandwich and the same check. Alrighty we get your point. We pay the bill and give her a tip of 15% based on the three meals and drinks that were appropriately delivered.   Needless to say we will never return. Never.... ever .....ever.",

The menu is a bit schizophrenic with Asian and Irish on the same menu, but everything we have had there has been cooked perfectly and served quickly!  You can't ask more than that from a restaurant.  They have a great outdoor area with heaters, I clicked very loud, but that is just in the bar area.  We had dinner with friends there in the past and conversation was much more pleasant farther from the bar,   The margarita was WONDERFUL, BUT they served it in a beer glass.

The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because the last time I was here was for a lunch date (first date) on a Saturday at noon, they open at 11:30. The hostess seated me at a table that had salad on the floor and the table or chairs weren't wiped off very well, if at all.   The hostess apparantly didn't see the serving of salad she was standing in or just didn't care, but everyone ignore the lettuce, croutons and tomatos on the floor.  Everyone probably figured that since it was so early that all the salad would be kicked under the table before the dinner rush :) Our server was excellent, I wished I could remember his name, but he was very attentive and a very cool guy. For lunch I got the lightly breaded chicken in lemon caper sauce with pasta and fresh green beans.  It was excellent, I must admit.  It's one of those dishes that's sooo good that you'll eat until you're full up to your eyeballs.  Of course I'll go back, next time I'll know to kick the krap on the floor out of the way, too.",

The music which they play also varies, I recommend Tuesday nights which is classic rock and Kilt Lifter, a great combination.

    "text": "The only reason this hip and trendy watering hole (which has all the charm of an airport bar) is getting two stars, instead of just one, is because the \"fish part\" of their fish and chips is so good. Our party of six stopped in for dinner last Sunday night: my 21-year-old daughter and her boyfriend (both ASU students), his parents, who had flown in from California for the ASU and Cardinal's games, and my husband and me. None of us had been here before, but my older daughter said she'd heard good things about it and we were looking for something near the airport. The guys also wanted a pub where they could watch sports on TV. The place was about half-full when we arrived, so I have no idea why we ended  up with a table almost at the back of the room, next to the servers' station and where my husband and our guests could see a TV only by looking over their shoulders.Talk about a pain in the neck! So ridiculous. Anyway, we ordered the artichoke spinach dip appetizer, which was average. Daughter ordered the Baja fish tacos and thought they were good. Her boyfriend had the orange chicken and said it was bad. His father had the beer cheese soup and thought it was great; his mother tried the quinoa something-or-other and said it was terrible; she hardly touched it. My husband had the bacon burger; I have to say it looked amazing and he thought it was great. I had the fish and chips and while the Napa slaw was tasteless and little more than chopped cabbage that had been dragged through a little mayo, and the chips were average, the battered fish pieces (3) were fried to crisp perfection. Really...the best battered fish I've ever had. So the food was hit or miss. My real problem was with the service...of which there was little to none. Our zombie-like server - on the rare occasions when we came into contact with her - wasn't exactly hostile, but her absolute disinterest, combined with her long absences from our table, really ruined the experience for us. Never once did she smile or engage us in any way, other than to take our order. No wasting time with pleasantries here, folks...just order, eat, and get the $&%& out. That's what it felt like. Except it took FOREVER for our food to arrive. And when one of our guests ordered a glass of wine, we literally waited at least 20 minutes for it...and got it only after we were finally able to flag down our server to inquire about it. When we asked what had happened to the wine, she said, \"Oh, the bartender's pouring that right now for you.\" Really? The place is half empty and it's a glass of *%&@ wine. It's been 20 minutes or more. Clearly, she'd simply forgotten about our order. Not ONCE during our drinks/appetizer or during dinner did our server (or anyone else, like a manager) ever stop by to inquire about our dining experience or to ask if we needed anything. No one ever asked if we needed something more to drink. No one EVER refilled any of our glasses. During the lost wine episode, we attempted to flag down a couple of other servers - for God's sake, ANYONE - who could help us since we hadn't seen our own server in forever, but no one even looked our way. Remember Tom Hanks in \"Cast Away\" when he finds himself all alone and marooned on that island and then he sees that ship's light way off on the horizon and he's desperately trying to get someone's attention? That's what this felt like. Horrible service!! H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E! Since our experience, I've read a few reviews and now understand that poor service appears to be a frequent complaint here. I wish I'd known that before. We ended with a dinner tab of around $165 for mostly average food, a couple of cokes, and some wine; usually I tip 20% or more, but felt that the 10% tip I left here was overly generous. I left feeling embarrassed that we'd taken our guests to this place for dinner before they left town. There are too many other decent places to eat; we'll never darken this door again.",

After about 10 minutes, we had still not been acknowledged by a server so I went back to the hostess and asked her if we could have someone take our orders. After another 5 minutes, our orders were finally taken. The food was decent but the service was absolute crap so I left her a dollar tip.",

The sauce was flavorful and had a kick thanks to the red pepper flakes, plus some spinach and halved cherry tomatoes.

    "text": "I have now been to this location twice.  If I had reviewed after my first experience I would have given four stars as our service and food were great.  The second time, however, left a lot to be desired.  Our food and beer were good, but that was it.  We wanted to sit at one of the high-top tables in the bar.  We asked one of the servers if they were self-seating and he told us that there wasn't anyone on that side of the bar that could serve us, that they had already been cut.  He told us that the high-tops on the other side of the bar would be fine.  We went over there and the server on that side said that the servers for those high-tops had been cut as well.  We then went back to the host stand, stood for multiple minutes before someone acknowledged us, despite four servers walking past us, and were then finally seated.  We were pretty close to walking out.  We were seated at one of the tables that we were told was closed and the server that had told us that ended up serving us.  She was not warm or friendly and was very abrupt in all of her interactions with us.  She never brought us napkins or silverware, we got them off a different table.  She brought our food out, set it on our table and walked away.  She didn't ask if there was anything we needed, she didn't say a word.  At the end of the meal when we were ready to pay, she took my card for payment and didn't bring it back for seven minutes.  We had very little interaction with her and when we did it wasn't pleasant.  We had thought, after our first visit, that we had found a new restaurant to frequent.  Unfortunately, it looks like we were wrong.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying this-I have been to Thirsty Lion many many times, I eat lunch here often, dinner as well, and I love their happy hour. I bring many of my friends and family here to try it for the first time and they always leave happy and in love with the place. The staff is insanely friendly and knowledgable, the food is to die for and there is a giant selection of beers to choose from.   However, this last experience I had was ridiculous. I would love to give this place 5 stars of course but I now want to give it 1 after what happened. I'll settle and take one away from the original 5. My husband and I decided to sit outside since the weather was gorgeous. Lunch on the patio at my favorite place...what could go wrong? Well started off great until our \"waitress\" (parentheses because I almost wouldn't call her one.) ruined our day.   We noticed there was a new menu with seasonal items, we asked questions about some of the food and Irene could not tell us a thing. She had to grab the other waitress in the area to tell us. We asked a few more questions and she would have to dart off to the kitchen and bar to find out the answers. She didn't know some of the items on the actual menu either. That's fine, maybe she was new. We tried to forgive her, however she seemed very uninterested in serving our table, that was UNTIL I got up to use the restroom. When I returned found her bent over the table trying to shove her pushup boobs in my husbands face. Trying to be cute and flirty, flipping her hair and giggling. I don't think so hunny. As soon I reached the table she walked away. Sorry to interrupt your conversation with MY husband.  After that as we were eating our food she made a point to bend over directly in front of my husband to clean a table. Normally I wouldn't have said a thing about it except for the fact that her skirt was so short she was giving my husband a free show. Not only that but her purposely turning around and making direct eye contact with him while doing so was very inappropriate. She continued to ignore me the entire time. It was like I was watching her attempt to seduce my husband in front of my own eyes. Both of us were very uncomfortable and finished our food quickly and paid our bill.   I waited up front to try to speak with a manager about what had just occurred but the hosts told me they were in the middle of an interview and might be a few minutes. I decided to write this review in hopes that a manager will read this to see what kind of trash they now have on their staff. Like I said, I frequent this restaurant very often and usually leave happy and full of good food and beer. This time I left upset and full of disgust and anger.  I love Thirsty Lion and would recommend it to everyone, just make sure you request anyone but IRENE.",

It was dry and the ingredients did not taste that great.  However, I came here another day for happy hour with my friend, and fell in love with their calamari.  It has a very tasty dipping sauce that comes with it and the calamari is very good.  The happy hour prices for alcohol weren't too bad either.  We both had a lot of homework, and I was very surprised that no one question us about having our computers on in the dark bar area.  (We honestly had a lot of work to do!)  We did this a second time, and the calamari was just as good again and no one complained to us about doing work there.  If you love calamari or got some work and need to drink during work, this is the place to go for me :)",

    "text": "It was St. Paddy's Day and we were perusing Tempe Marketplace for a decent hole in the wall when Hubby and I became so thirsty and hungry enough to eat a lion...hence the Thirsty Lion!  Wow, what a cool place.  It's hard to believe that I've walked past this place so many times speeding to get to Kabuki or California Kitchen without ever giving it a thought...but it just never called to me. Let's just say, I don't look for food, food finds me!  But I gotta tell ya, the minute we walked in we felt at home.  The place is mega-big, but you don't feel it at all.  Every section of the room is closed-in enough to give it a dining-room feel.  The waitstaff knows the real deal about service. We started at the bar because there were a lot of thirsty people waiting for a table and Scott, the bartender, made us feel like we were long-lost friends.  Get this...he introduced himself and shook our hands...what?! We were sold out right there.  And it was genuine.  When his shift ended, we wanted to close our tab so we could pay and tip him personally.  But he said, \"not to worry, the whole staff share all the tips.\" I thought I died and went to heaven's restaurant.  When we got our table, we met Austin who was just as cool and down to earth to interact with.  I mean I've had great service before but it never felt like I walked into my friend's dining room.",

A few of us arrived at about 3:30 and the place was almost empty.  We let the hostess know that we were going to have a group of about 8 people for HH.  She asked if we had reservations and was a little irritated that we didn't.  Now this place is huge inside and it was empty at 3:30, I thought her attitude was a little uncalled for.  We were surprised that it did start getting very busy at about 5:00 and the place filled up as she said it would.  So keep in mind you should make reservations for HH even on a Tuesday....who would have thunk it?  I didn't see our waitress Ashley that has been so great on Saturday, so we got Elena.  She said she was new so wasn't real familiar with the HH specials.  Service was very slow, the drinks and simple HH food took forever to arrive.  One of my coworkers ordered an appetizer and when asked later where it was, Elena responded that she thought she'd forgotten to place the order.  In Elena's defense, she was new and most of the service related issues were probably out of her hands.  I would probably come back for lunch again if I was in the area, but would go somewhere else for HH.  There's a lot of other places to choose from in the same area.",

Their salad portions are relatively small compared to other places, so don't expect it to make you full on an empty stomach.   Drinks: Drinks are alright. They have interesting beers, that I recommend if you're feeling adventurous.  Service: The servers are so friendly. They make me feel like they actually enjoy their job, unlike other places. They are energetic and definitely deliver excellent customer service from my experience.  Ambience: Casual. It's a great place for friends/family to catch up with each other. There are a ton of TVs for guests to watch their chosen sport.  Overall, I would definitely come back.",

    "text": "We stopped in early on a Saturday morning, 11-ish, both of our younger kids in tow.  The weather was  very nice so we decided to dine on the patio.  The atmosphere on the patio was pleasant, and we had great service, even sitting outside.    Our server was friendly and very helpful.  The food came in a timely manner, and was quite tasty.  I ordered the IPA-battered fish and chips to accompany the double chocolate porter from Four Peaks brewery...neither the beer or the food were disappointing.  I often order fish and chips at similar establishments, and I have to say the plate was on the high end of the scale here, I'd definitely recommend it.  I can't speak for the nightlife here, nor the dining experience inside, though I did go in  to have a look around.  The bar and dining area seemed spacious, there are lots of long tables in addition to two-seat tables and larger booths.  It was dark, as you would expect from a traditional pub, and I imagine when the weather here in the valley is hot, this place would make a nice oasis.  Our overall experience here was great, we definitely plan to return.  I would recommend this place to others, and would suggest if you are going to bring kids, sit outside.  The price was good too.  For one of the more higher end eating/drinking establishments at Tempe Marketplace it was very reasonably priced.  Oh yes, and with 53 beers on tap...many from local brewers, I would definitely recommend this place to fellow beer enthusiasts!",

We were told by our bartender they offer a military discount.  Come time to pay they consulted the bar manager.  Watched him ring it up and he brought the bill to us saying they DO NOT have a military discount but he would take \" a little\" off. (turned out to be 99 cents)  The beer was quite tasty but this place is simply overpriced.  One happy hour cost me the same as three great meals at Texas Roadhouse!

I'd highly recommend you try this dish. Really unusual but really good.   For dinner we split shrimp tacos and a Cobb salad. Our waitress had them split the food in the kitchen. When they brought out our dinner I thought they hadn't split our meal. Not True. Just a ton of delicious food. The tacos were on homemade corn tortillas. They came with black beans and a homemade salsa on the side. The Cobb salad was prepared beautifully. The presentation of both dishes was spectacular. And they were very tasty.   Service was tip top. The prices were extremely reasonable.   If I ever return to this area, I'll make a point to stop here.",

My girlfriend and I went for late night happy hour and ordered two house cocktails and a few appetizers. The prawns are $7 and there are only four small prawns. (Really?) The sushi was terrible and mostly made of rice. The tacos were so tiny and so dry. The only thing I ordered worth my money was the queso which was decent and a good portion. The service was rushed and unfriendly. It seemed like they didn't want to be there and would prefer we were quick and left as soon as possible. The bartender never introduced herself, didn't I.D. us (we are in our early 20's and bartenders as well), didn't give any suggestions or ask if we had been there before. The bartenders were more excited about chatting with each other. I can't honestly see myself going back again, I'd choose anywhere else in the Tempe Marketplace over The Thirsty Lion, unfortunately.",

We waited and waited but no server ever showed up. In fact most of the restaurant/bar emptied out. I guess we should of taken the hint because it seemed the majority of the customers knew how poor the service was once happy hour started and they left.

    "text": "The service here was surprisingly awful. The hostess was sweet asking whether we would like a table or sit at the bar. We decided a bar top would be better after seeing that almost every seat was taken besides the two seater at the end of the bar. The floor manager, I would assume, was rude and told us \"I am not a doorman\" and proceeded to make fun of us when we tried to show him our IDs as we came into the door. The bartender also denied our friends service because \"they already had a table.\" The waitress was obviously angry that we were not ordering food and gave us a scowl when we asked for drinks and not food. I will definitely not be coming back here due to lousy service. Maybe it was just a bad experience but I'm not spending my money here.",

    "text": "This is a service review only.  My date chose this restaurant because they have the beer he enjoys.  We arrived for our dinner reservation about 25 minutes early.  I had requested a booth.  They seated us at booth \"41\".  After about a 20 minute wait and nobody acknowledging us, or taking our drink order, we flagged down a waiter.  He said it was not his area but he would take our drink order.  A few minutes later our beers arrived.  My date's beer was the wrong color, so he knew it was not what he ordered.  We again flagged down who we thought might have been manager.  He said that beer comes in two flavors, so he took that one away and our waiter returned with the correct beer and an apology.  He said he should have asked which one, since they have two kinds of that same brand.  Sometime after we had started to drink our beers the waiter came back to take our order.  We started with the Scotch Eggs, which are amazing!  Soon after that we ordered our meals.  My date ordered the Green Chili Chicken Sandwich and I had the Grilled Veggie Panini.  When our meals arrived his looked fine, but mine was wrong.  So we once again we flagged down the waiter to make the corrections on my meal.  He promptly brought back my correct meal and an apology, again.  After we finished our meal we sat there for quite awhile to enjoy the various sports games on the tv's.  So when we were ready for our bill...shocker it as wrong.  They had not removed the first incorrect beer from our tab.  So, you guessed it, had to get the waiter back.  He corrected it and returned to us for payment, I must say that I was shocked that they had not COMPED us anything for all the errors make by them.  So to recap.  We had at least four different staff helping us throughout the night. they were understaffed for a Saturday night and our waiter \"Ryan\" we think that was his name did his best.   We will go back, but maybe we'll sit where we could be seen.",

    "text": "I'm a little shocked how high this place is rated, to be honest.  I'm not disappointed easily, but I've given this place three chances to impress and they've consistently disappointed.   I live nearby and was very excited for a new, trendy place to eat & drink. The first time we went there, we sat at the \"outside\" bar. The male bartender was not personable at all-he was actually quite rude. When I politely asked him if he knew the price of a liquor off the top of his head (and not to worry about it if he didn't, I was just curious), he snottily replied with, \"well, there's not a button for it so I don't know.\" He then rolled his eyes and walked away. I was astounded at how rude he was but shrugged it off. I actually felt bad because I thought somehow I offended or embarrassed him because he didn't know the price of this particular liquor, so I apologized to him, and he proceeded to made another smart comment about how he charged me the well price but that the next time I come in it might be much higher, again being very snotty and rude. My boyfriend was actually pretty upset at the way he spoke to me but chose to let it go because we just aren't the type if people to be confrontational or to complain.  After our meal and about an hour before close, he told us he was leaving and that another girl would be taking care of us. When she showed up all she did was clean the bar in preparation to close (even though that wasn't for another hour) and didn't even introduce herself or say hello. I waited for her to notice that my boyfriend's Blue Moon was empty but she was too busy cleaning so I asked her myself. She asked me what beer he was drinking, I told her, then watched her pour the wrong beer and give it to me as if I wouldn't notice. (Not all alcohol is available at that side of the bar. For instance Blue Moon and the liquor I was drinking are stored at the main bar, another point of annoyance for the original, rude male bartender. But how is that my fault? I didn't know that.  And clearly this girl didn't feel like going to the other bar to pour the correct beer for my boyfriend, even though she specifically asked me which beer he was drinking and then lazily poured whatever wheat beer they had in tap at the bar we were sitting at.) That was the \"straw that broke the camel's back\" for me. We paid out and went to Darcy McGees (in the same shopping center) where the staff are always pleasant and helpful.  We have since given the Lion two more tries but been severely disappointed with the service. The food is excellent- but just cannot make up for the terrible service. The second time we tried this place we sat at the main bar (as to not inconvenience the bartender at the outside bar), and all of the bartenders were too busy talking amongst themselves to notice that both of us were empty on drinks and hungry with no menus offered to us. I'm sorry to say that we won't be giving this place another shot.",

Also the food is always done well. 2) They're clean. The place just feels and looks clean. 3) Friendly staff. The staff is always funny and friendly. There's an Australian bar tender (forgive me if I am misplaced the accent, but it sounds very Australian) and he's great. He's friendly and funny, and so is the rest of the staff. 4) Good product. They've got a good selection of beers and liquor. The food is always great for pub fare. In fact, the food is actually quite good. I wish they had chicken wings, but you can't fault a place for sticking to a theme. 5) Price. They have good prices and a great happy hour.  Thirsty Lion and The Keg and probably the only two dinner spots in Tempe Market Place worth visiting.",

I didn't really get the pub feeling... the beer was ok... and the food wasn't typical pub food aside from the fish & chips. We had the supreme nachos that night and they were delicious. The fish tacos were pretty tasty as well. The disappointing part of our experience was the service.... it was AWFUL. We had to ask for things several times and we were constantly waiting for refills. Our waiter had too many tables and was all over the place leaving little attention for us. Maybe there is better service inside? Who knows. Not sure if we will be back.",

We had the beer cheese and the spinach dip with pretzels.  The pretzels were HUGE, like the size of my head!  The spinach dip was good and garlicky, but nothing to write home about.  The beer cheese was no bueno...and I really mean NO BUENO.  Bad enough that I actually complained about it to the server, who was not very sympathetic about serving something so rank.  Speaking of server, the service was a-ok.  I'm pretty sure he forgot about us a couple of times, but did a fine job when he was present.  The bathrooms are cool.

Another wasted night in a crappy chain restaurant based on pushing you out the door! Same as Friday's!",

A little hesitant to go in at first due to seeing about 10 people waiting to be seated, but it was only a 10 minute wait so we did. Thank the food Gods. Not only do they take your name but your phone # and send you a text alert when they are ready to seat you. Genius. I didnt have to sit there if I wanted to shop more or wait in the cute seating area in the marketplace.  The Australian accented man seated us, and was quite funny in just the 60 seconds he was with us.  We shared a chicken entree with vegetables which was plenty for us and was BEYOND my expectations, so delicious (I cannot remember the entree but it it was in an olive oil type sauce with capers). We also shared the grilled artichoke appetizer (yum). I only wish they hadnt run out of their soup of the day (clam chowder) because Im sure that would have blown me away as well.  It was a bit loud in there but it seemed to mostly come from one large table that looked like may have been a christmas party and is to be expected this time of year and would not deter me from going back again.  I will be back...soon!",

My boyfriend realized he forgot his wallet once we got to our car so he had to walk back in to grab it, and still no one said anything to him. For a night that wasn't particularly busy in the slightest, with no tables seated around us, the service left more to be desired. We ended up driving through Portillo's for food after wasting almost an hour here. Our fault for waiting around as long as we did, but annoying nonetheless!",

There is lunch and there is dinner, the prices for lunch need to be cheaper than dinner, any restaurant chain that has not gotten the message by now needs a brain check. I came for another date so there was no turning back, but there should have been due to the one menu policy. The $10 hamburger was average and the side portion of cole slaw was not well executed and tiny. This place has finally achieved one star status due to corporate greed at happy Hour and now lunch as well. date was boring too",

The happy hour price for spinach artichoke dip was 6 dollars, and it was tinier than a tin of cat food. Considering that this couldn't fill up an infant, we also ordered the pretzel and California roll. The pretzel was overcooked and very hard, and the accompanying cheese sauce was grainy, and tasted very poor. The California roll was old, and cold because it had been sitting in a refrigerator all day. It fell apart as soon as you touched it and was cold and slimy. We won't be going back unless we are only going to stop by for a single beer after a movie.",

In other reviews there was mention of being \"cut off at 4 beers\".  I inquired if there was a cut off rule of sorts and they advised only if a patron is under the influence and needs to be.  I too had the same outstanding service as Albert and too was asked my name, by the staff (Hilary and Lauren) and also the owner.

Could have been hostess or our fault, that's ok. Waiter got our drinks and then we lost him for 20 mins. Big problem when our food arrived. Our requested no onion, no tomato burger had both on it. Manager had delivered it, I asked for another, explained onion allergy. Replacement arrived in a timely manner. The problem was the waiter informed us he could lose his job for not writing it down as a food allergy, we needed to say it was food allergy next time. Manager brought us the new burger where he informed us we need to specify its a food allergy. My thought is why don't you just prepare it as requested. And if it does go wrong, don't make it about yourself. Making my teen daughter feel she did something wrong is not right. To make the evening completely comical our to go bag had a huge hole in the bottom and I had to knot it to put the containers in it. My husband did explain to the waiter his choice of words were wrong.  Instead of paying our $100 bill & tipping 20%, normal would be closer to 30, we should have talked with a manger. I guess I kept expecting the manager to say a sincere apology and not charge us for our 3 beers. Or that 1 burger. Or offer us desert. Something, anything to turn our evening around. Lesson learned, next time I speak up more. $100 is too much to spend for good food but really lousy service.",

We waited about seven minutes and were escorted to our table. Our server, Alyssa was very nice and helpful. I asked Alyssa which ladies drink she recommended (beer isn't April's thing). Alyssa recommended the Pear Cranberry cooler (seasonal drink) $8.50. I had a sip then helped myself to several other sips, it was good.

    "text": "I met a business associate here for lunch yesterday. They have only been open for two weeks so I was a bit apprehensive as to whether they have worked out the \"kinks\" yet. I was pleasantly surprised! The server was very attentive although the inexperience showed when after servicing us, she immediately returned to ask how our food was... we had not had time to take a bite yet! Lol BUT, the food was very good and I will definitely make this one of my luncheon spots to meet clients. I had the enchilida stack. Very tasty. The bar is huge and I think it would be a great place to meet up with the gang to watch a game or hold a mixer. It is clean and the staff is very courteous... all of them have big smiles and lots of hellos and thanks yous as you depart. The prices are a bit higher than your average grill... but honestly, the food is worth it in my opinion. They are new to the game, so be patient and in a short while this place will be seasoned enough to compete with the rest!",

I ordered the enchiladas and I couldn't stop offering them to my whole table - they were so good! My husband got the fish tacos which he loved! All in all we loved it here and will be back! Hopefully Vinny will be working too!!",

Oh, and I ordered a Blood Orange Margarita. The Blood Orange Margarita was sweet, just a bit sweeter than what I like. The nachos were  full of flavor.... EXCEPT the chicken was kinda cold? The fries were crisp and were delicious! Our server, Katie (spell check) was friendly and very attentive. We enjoyed our experience and will definitely be back. The only thing I would say.... next time I hope our nachos are all around warm.",

It is the only restaurant I frequent at Tempe Marketplace.  Great environment comfortable setting, and delicious food... What could be better? The managers are extremely friendly and so is the servers. I have been there over 30 times and never had a bad experience with a waitress which is extremely important to me.  Steaks, burgers, and enchilada stack are just a few of my favorites.  Highly recommend Thirsty Lion if you have the opportunity!",

Our server only asked one of us what we would like to drink before walking away, and gave attitude when the rest of my party put in what they ACTUALLY wanted to drink. It took over ten minutes to get a cider and cocktail; we could see that the entire time, all three bartenders were not busy - they just weren't making our drinks for whatever reason. Our food came out before the drinks. I ordered a burger medium well, and what was on my plate was medium rare, MAYBE medium. My friend's burger came with avocado when she asked for it to be kept off. After our food arrived, we saw our server once, and had to struggle to flag down another employee to get our checks and a box.   Terrible service. Rude employees. This experience makes me never want to dine here again.",

I understand we are probably your last table and you want to get out of here but we deserve to be treated just like everyone else. AND yes we are still waiting for you to come cash us out!!

Music was WAY too loud so it made it hard to hear our own conversation even outside. (It was even louder inside, and there were at least a dozen TV screens....yuck). Service was good although we had to ask for napkins and silver ware. This was very hard to find via GPS due to the high concentration of restaurants and shops in the area.",

Spinach artichoke dip was cold and would have been a decent size had the ingredients been nuked a little and stirred up. Again a ton of bread. Good thing cuz the ribeye steak was extremely fatty and the mashed potatoes inedible, obviously instant. And the steak salad had good flavor but literally 4 little slices of cold steak. Yuck!

Yes!) and one of their many beers on tap. Service is decent for a bar that mostly hires college kids. My only complaint is a lame one, but this place is so damn loud. This is a popular bar with a massive floor plan and lots of speakers.

    "text": "The BEST Impossible Burger in town! I go here exclusively for this item. It's so delicious. I had the burger at Islamorada fish Co and their version of it sucked.  Thirsty Lion does it right. However their fries are very gross. Always burnt tasting and saltless. I upgrade to asparagus sometimes in lieu of fries.  Please keep the Impossible Burger on your menu forever! If you take it off I'll have no reason to return.  It's always busy in here and the vibe is that of a cool pub. My favorite sitting place is the stage area to the right but they only let us sit there when it's busy enough.  The price of the burger is steep though. $16 with tax is a lot for a sandwich. It should be $11 maximum with tax. For this reason I only come once a month as I cannot justify the cost more often than that.  They would make more profit from me if they lowered the price, because I would come once a week if it cost $9 vs once a month at $15. I know it doesn't cost more than $2 to make the entire burger so they are missing out on profit due to volume. Too bad these businesses don't understand that simple concept: volume over greed. 4 x $7 = $28 profit vs 1 x $13 = $13 profit. Simple math.  They would double their profit by lowering their prices.",

I wish I could remember our servers name because he was amazing. Young good looking guy, very friendly and quick and prompt service.   For an appetizer we got a mini pepperoni pizza that was on happy hour for $4.50. It's was so simple, hot, and so tasty. I got the southwest smoked chicken salad and my fiance got the peppered bacon cheese burger. They were both super tasty and fresh. He loved the peppered bacon. Tons of pepper and lots of flavor. They also make their sauces homemade so the ranch and BBQ are amazing!   Overall a great experience between service, food, and price. Highly Recommend (:",

Our food took 30 minutes and the I think manager came over and checked on but didn't care our food took long. We told the waitress we are waiting for our food after seeing multiple people get there food who came after us. After we got our food  she never checked on us. We paid our tab and asked for a sprite Togo she dropped the Togo cup and left right away, and it was probably because she poured salt in our drink. Perry your service was horrible. We have had you twice has a waitress and you are rude and customer service is not good. Thanks for the salt in our drink I will be sure to call your manager as well.

I have never done any type of large event and I was clueless on what to do and Deanna made it easy on me and everything went better then I could have imagined.  The day of the party was organized and our hostess Marissa was by far the best!!! She was server and bartender and was on top of everything!!! Not to mentioned the sweetest girl ever!! I had the fiesta bar for food and it was delicious, and plenty to feed around 30 people. All the guests were going for seconds, and thirds!!!

    "text": "Met up with some former classmates here to catch up and to grab a bite to eat. Tempe was central for all of us so we decided on Thirsty Lion since we met up here before.   We were quickly seated on a Sunday afternoon and our server was really efficient and nice. I started my meal with a mimosa and when our server brought it to the table, he has asked me if my mimosa was okay the way it was (it probably had just a splash of orange juice). I told him it was perfect! Most places dilute their mimosas with too much orange juice.   Since we were sitting at a high top and the stools did not have a back to it for me to hang my purse, I looked for a purse hook under the table. I couldn't find it but the server pointed it out to us later. It was farther than my short arms could reach so you have to lean over a little to find it in the middle of the table.   I decided to go with the Thai Shrimp & Noodle Salad for my meal that was on their seasonal specialties menu. Perfect for the warm weather we have going on now in Arizona. The shrimp was seasoned very well and there is definitely a spicy kick to the salad that complemented it nicely. It comes with shredded coconut but I wasn't really feeling it yesterday so I asked for my salad without the coconut. While it was a yummy salad, I felt like there should have been more greens and less noodles.  Even though I am trying to work on my beach body for summer, I did not turn down dessert. A friend and I split the brownie dessert. It was scrumptious and I would totally get it again. Perfectly chewy and loved the nuts on top.   Overall, great spot for lunch or dinner at Tempe Marketplace.",

Dinner goers or maybe even just desert.   After a failed attempt to eat at Gen Korean BBQ we ended up at thirsty lion. I immediately noticed they changed their menu yet again. I knew this because one of my favorite items, the charcuterie board was not on the menu.   The appeal with changing the menu is that it kind of feels like you are eating at a different restaurant each time.  We went with the smoked chicken nachos. The banh mi sliders and the pear and prosciutto flatbread.   I really enjoyed the sliders. They were different and very flavorful. However the nachos were to die for. I would probably have to say they were the best nachos I have ever eaten. And of course the flatbread is always a sold choice.   The waitress could have been a little more patient with us but overall It's always a good time at The Thirsty Lion.",

She was friendly and checked on us frequently.    Food- 3 stars-  We started off with the Oven Baked Soft Pretzel ($10.95) which was fantastic.  No complaints there.  For just the 2 of us it was very filling which we calculated into what we were going to order for dinner.  Being we were both half full we decided to split the Specialty Entree the Bacon Mac ($14.50).  I'm generally not a big mac n cheese type when eating out, but after a recent Yelp event at a small but outstanding establishment that also had a bacon mac-n-cheese item on their menu I have been craving ever since.  My wife had ordered at that place as bar food and I fell in love with it.  So here I now sat waiting anxiously for this Bacon Mac-n-cheese.  And we waited, and we waited, and we waited some more.  We waited long enough that I could of easily been drunk if I had continued to order more beer.  Luckily I had my one and done and resorted to water until the food arrived.  Once it arrived it was quickly apparent it was over-cooked, burnt on the bottom and just not good.  Usually you add bacon to anything and it's great.  Not this.  At this point I'm remembering our 2 previous visits and was not impressed those times either with our meals.  I worked at some restaurants back in the day and I refuse to ever send any food back from those memories.  So I ate my portion and left very disappointed.    Waitress- 5 stars-  I will say we've had great service aside from the food the times we've been here.  Tonight was no different.  Atmosphere- 5 stars- The place has always been lively and full of families, friends, couples, co-workers, you name it.  Plenty of TV's to watch sports and not so loud you can't have decent conversations.  Price- 1 star- It's really hard to stomach paying what we did for the meal we received.  I'd probably gave this place a 4.5 star review if I only had the drinks and appetizers.    Overall I'd meet people here for drinks and such, but not coming here for the food.  I refuse to be fooled for the 4th time.",

We ordered and received our drinks in a timely manner. Waited about 20 minutes before the server returned. We ordered food. After receiving our food, we basically never saw the server again. He never even came to the table to get the menus. After 30 minutes I put the menus on the floor. They stayed there for over an hour before the manager finally picked them up. The table was never cleared. We were never offered a refill on water. We were there to celebrate a birthday. We told the server that, and he chose to ignore that. With so many other options at Tempe Marketplace, I doubt if we will return.",

Love the set up!  1st off let me tell you, on Mondays they run this special were it's a large pizza, 2 sodas & 2 movie tickets for $19.99,,,are you listening to this!!! Its dinner & a movie for under 20 bucks! Yea that makes Monday night date nights way easy baby!   We decided on the happy hour menu, and what a great little menu, you can try all types of things and barely hurt your wallet! Prices were from $3.95 to 5.95 with plenty of variety.  And I think their happy hour beer prices were $3.50 to 4 bucks and they had wine, well drinks & margaritas for 4 bucks too!   Ordered the Pub Chip Nachos, homemade potato chips, melted mix of cheese, bacon, onion, tomato & this chipotle aioli sauce, that sauce was great!  Loved it! Could eat chips in it all day!!   Look forward to coming back and trying out other dishes!",

The happy hour beer list has been knocked down to just the normal and doesn't include craft beer options which is what I look for.

The service is horrible and the hosts spend more time chatting between themselves than helping incoming customers. I felt like I was breaking up a group date just asking for table!

My mother ordered the same thing. We both received filets with green beans. Our steaks were cooked totally differently. Mine was medium-medium-rare and hers was medium-rare (as ordered). The green beans were hilariously undercooked. Waitress came by once after giving us our food and didn't try to do anything to correct the overcooked steak apart from offering me barbecue sauce to make it less dry...    Overall, everything was pretty mediocre, and for a $105 bill for three people, this was comically bad. Learn how to cook steaks or don't serve them.",

Not a problem at Thirsty Lion.  This Reuben looked like you made it your self - kind flat.  In a case of the senses complementing each other, the taste lived down to the visual, as the Reuben tasted pretty flat, too.  The kraut was dull, and the Russian dressing was bland.  But the fries - nope - blah.  The service was pretty good.  And, they had soccer on several of the TVs.  Soccer.  Really.  At least there was a baseball game to break up the visual monotony.",

    "text": "I've been here twice now - once with a group of 10, once alone.  With the group, our server was attentive.  I ordered the Shepherds Pie seasonal special.  My entire table's order came out at the same time, except mine.  They told me mine would be right out.  10 minutes later, I asked the waitress about it.  She went to check on it and said it would be right out.  I got a piping hot meal, and for the inconvenience, she removed it from my bill.  I never would have asked for that, since I did get my food, but I appreciate the commitment to service.  It was delicious.  Not as good as mine, of course, but delicious.  Second time, I was killing time before a movie and was craving that same beer I'd had with my Shepherd's Pie, so I came back with my book.  I got myself a few beers and some appetizers.  I was all alone on the patio (it was a pretty warm day, but it felt good to me) but my server was consistent in checking on me without going overboard.  Food was very tasty (tempura green beans and pork sliders).  I definitely enjoy this place.  Good food, good service.  I'm far from a beer connoisseur, but they have a good enough variety for me.  There are really very few beers I do like, but they have at least two of them, so thumbs up.",

    "text": "52 different beers on tap!  In addition to the standard beers you'll find at any restaurant, they have several locally produced brews so that anyone searching for a beer to fit their taste will most likely find it.  I tried the White Chocolate Ale, which had a nicely toasted nut flavor with a white chocolate background, more of a refreshing light beer.  My friend tried some of it and remarked that if dessert beers ever existed, this would be one of them.  I'm not too much of a beer fan and the closest beer-like beverage I've enjoyed is lambic, but it did taste nice compared to other beers I've had.  We started with the scotch eggs, which were excellent.  The breading was nice and crispy, the pork sausage was flavorful and moist, and the eggs were perfectly cooked with a deep golden color to the yolks.  I had the vegetable panini for lunch, which was decent, albeit greasy.  The coleslaw I ordered with it was creamy but bland.  The menu itself has a weird mix of foods from different regions.  I was surprised to see orange chicken on the menu on a pub menu that seems to be focused more on pub-type food like fish and chips and scotch eggs.",

The bartender seemed to be a bit new and lost in making drinks fast enough but it wasn't too long of a wait for our margaritas. They were really good actually. I don't understand why restaurants serve mashed potatoes without gravy. No one likes them without some sort of gravy. The filet mignon comes with gravyless mashed potatoes, I asked if they had gravy and she said no. So I got fries instead. I anticipated the lack of gravy. The steak came medium like I asked for it to be but it was still rather tough. I recommend not getting a steak here. The asparagus was a bit tough to cut but everything was seasoned well, even the steak was well seasoned but it was just tough and chewy. The fries are really really really good! Crispy on the outside and soft inside and well salted.  For dessert we got the smores thing that came in a glass. I anticipated it being more so on a plate and presented like a sandwich but instead it was like a pudding but it was layered and soooo good!!! You have to get the s'mores dessert dish!  My friend got the pork wrapped shrimp with white rice and some sliders and the shrimp was really good!",

I questioned why they didn't have one of the worlds most popular beers on tap and the bartender rudely said, \"Because we have it in bottles.\"  I thought she was joking so when she returned with 2 bottles of Miller Lite I asked the same question and got the same rude answer.  I then noticed the price of the beers were almost 5 bucks each for a Saturday afternoon.  I then wrote an email complaining about the rude bartender and never received a reply.  I will never go back to this overpriced corporate dump.  I hope they fail like the last place.",

The ceviche is a very tiny portion, served in a shot glass filled with half lettuce. Lettuce should not be a food item in ceviche anyway!   Margarita pizza had no mozzarella on it and maybe had one sprig of basil on it, with cherry tomatoes....WHaattt!!!!     Waiter was nice and very pleasant, but the hostesses were all very sloppy and looked very disheveled.  One hostess had hair extensions that were peeking out of her scalp and her hair was all matted and tangled in the back. I think she was the same one who had on a skirt and she had tattooed letters all down her legs, it looked as if a four year old drew all over her before she went to work, Maybe that's actually what it was, Nothing wrong with tattoos or hair extensions, but pull yourself together for gosh sakes!  Look presentable, you are the first impression to customers.   We complained about the ceviche, and never did a manager come over to apologize and we saw the waiter explaining to him from across the room that it wasn't good.   This place seems to be going south fast.   We would normally eat here three to four times a month, but unless they get it together, we are not interested in returning.",

They said it would be a few minutes. There were six people in the whole place!  We waited 15 minutes before being seated (by the time we left at 7, it was only 1/4 full).   TL seems to be going thru an identity crisis: are they a sports bar, an Irish Pub or something else?    Beer selection was ample, along with 4 seasonal beers. Got my fave: Kilt Lifter.   Ordered several apps, with mixed reviews: the soft pretzel was good but the cheese sauce was nasty. What did they put in it?  The crab cakes were small, heavily breaded with little flavor. The calamari was liked by some and not others. I found them bland. The pub chip nachos were a big hit and we ended up with three plates of them!  Our entrees came, which were mostly burgers, since reviewers said to stick with those. One brave soul tried the Kung Pao Chicken and said it was very good with good spice level. Another got Beef Tenderloin Tips and was pleased, but not with the $17.95 price tag.   Service was adequate but for a party of eight on a slow night, I expect better than adequate.",

Thats my fault for traveling on V-Day!!!  Food is supposed to be pub food, and they are trying to channel and English Pub feel, but the music is a bit loud for that comparison.  The menu is full of burgers, and only one True pub food, fish and chips.  Other than that, menu is traditional American.  Really nice beer selection, wine is weak (as you would expect in a pub, so I have no problem).  Food was good, but just ok.  Come here for the atmosphere and opportunity to meet someone fun.

    "text": "We went out with a big party on Saturday night and the service was very good.  Unfortunately, the food quality fell short on every level.    I ordered the beef tenderloin tips which was off the seasonal menu.  It came out looking like soup all over the plate with a huge helping of mashed potatoes.  After taking only one bite of the mashed potatoes I realized they were instant and not satisfying at all.  The only thing was good on my plate was a few pieces of meat mixed in the stew and my green beans.  Food quality was poor for several of our guests and even saw that someone from another table left their helping of mashed potatoes as well.  Make REAL potatoes with quality ingredients and this place might be worth it.  Will not be back as the qaulity of the food and the price was not worth our time.",

    "text": "Went here for the XTRA910 NFL Draft party on 4/25.  Place is nice setup. Lots of beers on tap.  Service or at least the server we had was horrible.  After 5 minutes of waiting for the server to come up, I placed my order for a coors light... waited 15 minutes, then the server came back saying my beer must of been delivered to the wrong table, asked what I wanted and then I waited another 15 minutes before getting my first beer.  Happy hour price of $3.50 for a pint of Coors Light is not the best, but ok.  We decided we wanted a round of shots and we were promptly told that they can't do that.  What a great drinking establishment.  No shots if you have beers.  Well who the hell wants to wait 30 minutes between a beer and a shot, not me.  Very disappointed with the service.  I really hope our server was having a horrible day because she was awful.",

They have a nice beer selection and that food wasn't HORRIBLE (though not noteworthy) but definitely go to Four Peaks down the street instead if you're looking for a great brewery and food experience (while supporting local business!)",

    "text": "I'm writing this review after what started off as a good experience turned incredibly lack luster.  I took my friend here last night for her b-day and wanted some grub and good craft beers. It was a busy Saturday night with a wait, so we opted to eat dinner at the bar top.  The food was mediocre and the service was rather good, at first.  After two beers I was feeling a little bloated and decided to end the night with a cocktail, trouble is our server disappeared.  I sat there with a noticeably empty glass for over ten minutes. I located our server in the corner singing and dancing and yucking it up with coworkers and then with one particular male customer (he must tip well).  Finally the other bartender came close to us but only made conversation with the male customer next to us; again I was still sitting there, glass completely empty.  Finally I decided it was enough and just put my card down to pay, and of course that took another 10 minutes of waiting around.  Look, I'm fine with the wait staff having a good time (in fact I encourage it), however this shouldn't come at the expense at the customer's experience.  I work in the service industry and expect a good experience; I won't be back here for awhile after last night.",

The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere is more like an upscale restaurant than a bar and grill. We have been back several times. Everything that we have tried was truly exemplary. We definitely plan on going back and trying everything else on the menu.",

The atmosphere is upbeat and lively with various large seating areas with a variety of table options. The bar also has plenty of seating with abundant TVs for easy viewing. There are great happy hour options for food and drink with an abundant beer list. We only tried the appetizers while we were there, but I HIGHLY recommend the reuben sliders and garlic sesame edamame. Also, there is a local stout called Papago Elsie's Irish Coffee Stout - mind blowing! If you are into that kind of thing try it. I'm looking forward to visiting AZ again just to pick some up.",

They have all sorts of \"extreme appetizers\" and \"signature cocktails\" and so on.  There is a huge tap selection. However, a lot of them are occupied by BudMillerCoors or psuedo-craft brews like Newcastle, Blue Moon, and their ilk. They do have some very good beers, but the huge tap count is just not needed. The food delivers exactly what it promises. It's very rich and most things seem to be fresh. Prices are okay and their happy hour is pretty good. The service was good on my first visit and very bad on my second, so I don't know what to say about that.  I should admit that I just don't like going to Tempe Marketplace. If I have a friend who really likes this place and wants to meet up here, I won't say no. I'd just rather go to Taste of Tops, Papago Brewing, Four Peaks, or about a half a dozen other places.",

    "text": "I hate being disappointed by bars bragging about their \"huge\" number of taps... while I can't dispute that they have 52 beers on tap, I can tell you that very few of them are worth drinking.. and that the prices here are on the ok to high side... I would never come back if it's not happy hour or late night pricing. I asked general questions about not discounted pricing, nine dollars for a Manhattan made with Jack Daniels and beers ranging from five to seven dollars... if I'm paying seven bucks for a pint at a sports bar in Tempe it had better be something from Russian River or a Stone anniversary brew... and a nine dollar Manhattan seems out of place... this isn't Scottsdale or a hotel bar.    Well the good news, Thirsty Lion is quite lovely inside, plenty of seating and dim lights, really not a bad place to relax and mellow out. Plus, the food was great, everything we've had has been very tasty, now it's all been off of the happy hour menu, but that's the only time I'll probably be here, the scotch eggs are delicious and my main recommendation. I'm hoping that in time prices will drop a bit and more craft breweries will get represented, but aside from the nice interior and spot on happy hour menu, Thirsty Lion just doesn't stand out enough to steal me away from Boulders or Taste of Tops...",

We were directed to go sit out by the fire pit if we wanted while we waited.  In about 15 minutes we were seated at a table outside on the patio.  Our server, Joe (\"hey-guy\") was one of the best servers we've had in a long while!  He offered suggestions and we ended up with the NW Pub Burger with salad and blue cheese dressing and the Kobe Beef Burger with fries.  Both were awesome and the Pub Burger is to die for!!!  During our meal, Rene (a manager) came over to ask how we were doing.  We told him we were first-timers.  He told us to save room for dessert and during that discussion, told us we should try them all!  I told him that if they were on the house, we'd be happy to and he could come join us.  Long story short...he sent over the cherry bread pudding (on the house) and it was fabuous!  We will be regulars and can't wait to try some of the other options on the menu.  Everyone was friendly and we had a 5-star experience, top to bottom!",

I liked the atmosphere here, it is a  slightly upscale London  type pub but much larger. The dining area has tall padded booths around the sides and center area features wooden tables and chairs.  Large HD TVs all around the Pub but volume was off in dining area for lunch service.  It had a wide variety of items, also starters had some non generic items I cant wait to go back for. I like a good scotch egg :)  For Lunch we ordered  a 1/2 lb Cheeseburger and the Caprese Chicken Sandwich.  Both were excellent.  Cheeseburger had to be eaten with two hands. However not a fan of the fries.  Caprese Chicken Sandwich Grilled chicken breast, fresh mozzarella, vine ripe tomato, spicy pepperoni, sweet pepper tapenade, garlic pesto aioli, arugula and olive oil on grilled herb focaccia. was a delight to my mouth. It was large  and I was only able to eat half.  I had a side salad with  my sandwich and the balsamic dressing rocked my taste buds.   Will be back for happy hour  to chill with friends as Daily Imported Beer specials are  but $4!",

It really isn't reminiscent of \"pub\" at all and once I saw the menu with minimal pub fare on it, I just had to move past that idea and look at it from a different perspective. The hostess was rude, but our server was absolutely amazing. He joked, had a constant smile, and always could tell when our drinks needed refilled. 5 stars for him. I got a chicken caprese sandwich, sounds good right? It wasn't as good as I thought. The thick mozzarella on it was cold while the rest of the sandwich was hot which made the bread extremely soggy. I only ate a small portion of it. The fries on the side were great though, nice and crisp! I've heard their burgers are really enjoyable. I would go back and try something different, such as a burger, but from my first experience their we both agreed it wasn't that great.",
