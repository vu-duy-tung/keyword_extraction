I am happy to say that Cafe Tranquilo has been a fantastic addition to the Clarendon Hotel. I live within walking distance of Cafe Tranquilo and tend to go there almost weekly. I am thrilled to have such a great spot nearby. Their menu is solid! They've made fantastic changes to their menu since they've opened. I've enjoyed their breakfast (try the chilequiles) and dinner options. If you're just hanging out for happy hour, get the guacamole, tacos, or Elote dip....you won't be sorry. They serve Lux coffee, major bonus points there! And a HUGE shout out to our server Jake!!! His service has been top notch and his recommendations have been on point. Thank you Cafe Tranquilo...I will likely be back within the week. ;)",

Breakfasts at the weekend deserve to be lingered over, with a Bloody Mary or two and some friends, and the menu and staff there make this a delight. May I recommend the chiliquilles highly but be prepared to share them.        The bar is well stocked and the bar staff really know their stuff with a well thought out cocktail menu and local craft beers. Poolside bar service is a huge bonus in the summer months too. Allow a little extra time at weekends as the local crowd is augmented with travelers from the adjoining hotel.         Visit this oasis in the centre of Phoenix and you'll be coming back for more.",

    "text": "Lackluster service and just-passable food makes this hotel restaurant a rather forgettable place. I went there for breakfast twice, while on a weekend \"staycation\" at the Clarendon Hotel, chaperoning my son during ComicCon. When my wife booked the room, it came with breakfast vouchers - vouchers that are actually only good for $12.50. Add a cup of coffee to almost anything on the breakfast menu and you're almost assuredly going to blow through the $12.50 if you include tax and tip.  Not that I'd try to dissuade you from having the coffee. It's actually really good. Probably my favorite thing there.  On my first visit, the service was absolutely abysmal. I was seated at the counter -  in full view of everyone - for over 15 minutes before the hostess (seeing that I was being ignored) took it upon herself to scribble my order onto a post it note. I ordered a breakfast burrito with chorizo. I think places like Chipotle have raised our collective expectations as to how large a burrito should be, and this one came in at disappointingly \"modest.\" It was, however, packed with chorizo. Unfortunately its flavor was masked by the copious amount of salt that they put on it. Yikes. It was served with two salsas (stick with the red one) and a small bowl of fruit. Not great, but hey - it was under the $12.50 mark.  The next day the service was a little better. I was seated promptly and my waiter took my order right away. This time I went with the sausage burrito. It was actually smaller than the first one, mainly because there was very little sausage in the burrito. Oh, and no salsa. No fruit either. I wasn't really going to make a fuss and complain about this \"free breakfast.\"  But I'm also not planning on ever coming back.  You may have better luck with their lunch or dinner menus, but I'm not going to find out...  Happy dining!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying this review only has to do with my most recent visit.  I was there with a friend last night (Tuesday), and we went because of Bingo.  Yes, the temperature yesterday was a record high but the temperature in the restaurant was also a record high!  It was practically sweltering!  We sat in the lounge as that is where Bingo was happening.  The ONE bartender was overwhelmed as he was making drinks for not only the bar crowd but the restaurant patrons as well.  The place was jammed packed as it was not only Bingo, but Taco Tuesday and everyone likes a bargain right?!!    The staff was incredible though...everyone was pitching in to help where they could and kept a smile on their faces while under great stress and heat.  I was at a community table and my friend and I ordered guacamole, the delicious corn and two chicken tacos plus house margaritas.  Everything tasted delish but the lady next to us said our chicken tacos looked different from hers....ours was shredded chicken and hers were like cubes of chicken.  We asked a busboy and he went and checked and came back and said they had run out of chicken and were having to use a different kind.  I really liked mine but the lady next to me said she didn't like hers.  Anyway, the place continued to bustle and the poor bartender continued to be in the weeds.  I can't say enough good things about how the staff worked together to make an effort to keep things moving but there really should have been two bartendars on duty.    I love the fact the hotel allows Bingo to be played there and it brought in a good crowd of people who were all ordering food and drinks so its a smart move, but next time please have the place cooled down and make sure there is enough staff.  I have been here several times in the past and this was my first somewhat negative experience so i'm willing to give it a pass.",

    "text": "Gallo Blanco was super close to me, and I would go there a few times a week. I loved the food, and I was so sad when I closed down. It's taken me awhile to try the new place, and I was pretty skeptical after seeing the abysmal reviews on Yelp. I've ended up going 3 times before posting this review. Initially, I thought people were being a little unfair on this place, and I stand by that, although each visit was so different that I can understand why people might blast this place.  Yes, it's trying to fill the void of Gallo. Yes, there are a lot of similarities between the new menu and the old Gallo menu. The same staff work here, but the decor is different. The outdoor patio area is bigger, and it looks like there's a private banquet area with its own little patio attached to the restaurant. The servers wear uniforms now.  We started with chips and salsa and some drinks. I had a boring rum and diet so I can't comment on their cocktails, although I will say my drink was strong. Beer was fine. The prices for drinks are a little higher, and I guess there wasn't a happy hour, but now there is? Not sure what time or what deals they run during that time.  Chips and salsa were reminiscent of Gallo - a red one, a green one, and some pico de gallo, but this place gave us a creamy avocado one, too. The red salsa, if you want to compare it to Gallo, was a little less spicy and a little less refined in terms of flavor. The green one, again compared to Gallo, was a little spicier and a little more tart. Pico de gallo is pico de gallo. The creamy avocado salsa was nice. Chips are the same. Objectively, I think the chips and salsa were good.  Husband had a burger. He said it tasted just like the cheeseburger from Gallo. He asked for medium rare but it came medium well, maybe well done. The fries were nice. I had a fish taco, which featured rockfish, and a carne asada taco. I think there's more protein in the new place's tacos. The carne asada was cooked differently so it was actually a bit more tender - maybe due to the fact that it was shredded and not chopped up like Gallo. I liked the rockfish taco a lot. It wasn't like Gallo's fish taco, but it was good.  Ended up going there again and the carne asada taco was super chewy. It was seasoned pretty well but the meat was just too tough. The fish taco was still pretty good. On a third visit, the carne asada was better, but not as good as the first time around. Food being inconsistent isn't good, but I'm glad it got a little better instead of progressively worse.  For people complaining about the service - well, in my honest opinion, the service was on the bad side at Gallo. It was SO SLOW - took forever to place an order. Food would come out quickly, but if you wanted a refill on a nonalcoholic beverage, or even if you wanted a second cocktail, it took awhile to grab someone's attention. It also took a long time to get the check and have it processed. I honestly think it's about the same now. The restaurant wasn't dirty when I went in, so I can't really comment on that like others have mentioned.  So overall, I think it's pretty good food. I like that it's close to where I live. Service is OK. It's got a nice ambiance. The prices aren't fantastic, but it isn't highway robbery, either. It's tough saying goodbye to Gallo because it really was outstanding, but I think Cafe Tranquilo is pretty good. If you haven't been, I think it's worth a try - just come with an open mind.",

Let me just say WELL done chef!! It was great to see how you enjoy what you do. They were cooking and enjoying their time back there. They were pumped up and ready for the day. I loved it! We are from LA so sad to say some people just are not like that so to come to this restaurant was wonderful. We will be back because we are moving down here. So thank you to the entire staff!

I try not to write negative reviews but we left the restaurant upset and feeling was we just wasted our time and money....The food and service was terrible.   -The bar was dirty and unkempt, terrible first impression. -Staff stood at the bar while one pregnant server chatted about her personally aches and pains as we ate. Gross  -That same staff proceeded to order her lunch in front of us for 10minutes, go to another register!  -The menu is way overpriced  -The tacos lacked flavor ie tasted like white grandma tacos from Minnesota where she found the recipe from a 1979 issue of sunset mag - The presentation of the tacos- terrible. Just slapped down open face on a plate by that same grandma or from a prison kitchen  - $8 mimosa on a Sunday, really?! - No brunch specials or items of any kind  - $5 small iced toddy- that price is ridiculous  - Music was barley playing and what was heard was not impressive  -We just left and walked by a group of staff and no, thank you, see you later etc.   Understanding the concept had to transition quickly but there should be no excuse for bad service and dirtiness. I don't see how anyone would can't to come here until they dramatically change things and get their act together.   - peace, love n tacos  m",

My boyfriend and I came here Sunday evening around 10pm and the place was pretty dead (which we expected). I hadn't been to Gallo Blanco in a very long time, which is regrettable since I live right near The Clarendon.   The good: The food is great. I ordered the chopped salad and loved the jalapeno dressing. My boyfriend ordered carne asada tacos, which he enjoyed. The tacos did come with an awfully large amount of salsa compared to the size of the tacos (street taco size). Weird. He ordered 2 and wished he had ordered more because 2 does not a meal make!   The bad: Service. While our server was certainly a nice person, for some reason our beers did not come until after our food was served. It's just beer, so I do not understand why we waited so long. Plus, we were one of a whopping 2 tables dining (not counting the few people at the bar). We also had to request silverware.   I admit that I was expecting to hate this place based on other reviews that I read. It is not Gallo Blanco, but was anyone expecting it to be the same place? If you adjust your expectations a notch and go in knowing that this is a different restaurant, albeit has a similar menu. Overall, the food quality is there, the service could use some improvement.",

    "text": "Cafe Tranquilo is owned by the Clarendon Hotel and it's a great add.  Now that the hotel and restaurant is owned by the same owner, you can order room service while staying at the hotel.   The food here is excellent and mouth watering delicious! On Sat, I had a party of 6 adults and 6 kids by the pool during lunch time and we were provided with great service by Yusa. Everything we had was good.  The chips & salsa, chips & guacamole (chunky full of fresh guacamole & flavorful), grilled cheese sandwich- everyone enjoyed their food.  And it was promptly served. Which can be a factor when receiving poolside service from an on site restaurant.  Great add & I look forward to getting room service while staying at the Claredon!",

The ceviche was extremely fresh, the salad for the chips were delicious, and the pupusas were authentic and doughy (in a good way). The chilaquiles had a great kick with the salsa ranchera (I rarely see ranchera anywhere).  Ambiance was flawless and service was spot on. Even live music at dinner ! We would return here even if we weren't staying at the hotel.",

We went on Christmas Eve mainly because it was one of the few places open.   We had the chips & salsa trio and street corn for an appetizer. I need to get over the fact that chips & salsa are NOT complimentary in a Mexican restaurant. For our main meal he had the steak burrito and I had grilled garlic marinated shrimp tacos. I am gluten intolerant and I do not eat meat (seafood/fish are my exceptions). I wish there were more gluten free and vegetarian options. The shrimp did not taste garlicky nor did they have a grilled flavor. I taste more than anything the creamy Mayo tasting sauce they put on it. A little of that sauce went a long way. My husband enjoyed his burrito and the portion was substantial, he needed a doggie bag.  The highlight of the evening was the live entertainment. The singer sound like Jose Feliciano. I would return to hear him.",

We order guacamole which takes 10 minutes to make it to the table.   We order a salad. I see them walking around carrying the plate from side to side in the kitchen and looking as if they don't know why they are there. By the time it gets to us the hot chicken is cold. It's now been 45 minutes since we sat down.   We canceled that and the tacos that we ordered which apparently take an hour to make.   The previous two times we've been here for breakfast the food was so slow that I was almost late for work.   Don't know why this kitchen can't push out food in a timely manner especially for food as simple as tacos and salad.",

We hung out for at least 30 minutes after closing out to chat and finish our drinks. The waiter came back and said he had accidentally undercharged my friend. She took out her receipt and pointed out that she had already paid for her meal and drinks. The waiter walked away. We hung out for a bit longer and left (after being there for over 2 hours total). Turns out the restaurant had reopened her check after we left and charged her the additional money without her consent. After calling the manager to try and discuss the situation, he said he would try and reverse the charge and left it at that. I don't think I would return after the way this was handled.",

    "text": "Cafe Tranquilo is the restaurant of Clarendon Hotel, where we stayed for two nights in Phoenix. Each hotel guest receives a complimentary breakfast voucher good toward $12.50 worth of food excluding alcoholic beverages. It's a great value and very kind of the hotel.  We just ate dinner here the night we arrived from PHX. Complimentary chips and salsa were served as soon as we sat down. In addition to salsa, they also gave us avocado dip, mole chili, and chili verde. The chili verde was my favorite and chips were bottomless! Moscow Mule was put in its right place as Tranquilo serves it in a tall trim copper cup. Cosmopolitan is a pretty pink in a champagne glass.  Tacos are all a la carte. Out of the three my favorite was the beer battered fish. Batter not too thick and it came with a tangy mayo sauce. Carne asada is just okay, with a smokey taste to it. The braised tinga pork was also tasty. Pork was tender and not stuck in the teeth.  For breakfast, they have a big selection including gringo (regular bacon and egg), chilaquiles, huevos rancheros, French toast. Their coffee is excellent, not the cheap watery stuff from a can. It's a breakfast blend with an aroma. Coffee is always piping hot.   *Gringo Breakfast ($7.5) two eggs any style with choice of bacon or sausage. Bacon is inconsistent between the first morning and the second. Maybe the chef took the day off after being slammed on Fourth of July. The fried potato is diced and sauteed with onion and bell pepper.   *Chilaquiles ($10) is a bit too chili-ish. The sauce is very red and the taste very strong. Diced chicken with two overeasy eggs. It's not my favorite chilaquiles but it's adequate enough.  *Mushroom and Spinach Scramble ($9) is much better than the chilaquiles. Two scrambled eggs tossed with chopped mushroom and spinach. It's very good with melted oaxaca cheese. Totally hit the spot, as I love scramble.  Coffee and water are always refilled with a smile. It's a very friendly and casual dining atmosphere.",

The drinks are ridiculous here as well. Spiced apple cider mimosas were hand made by Jeffrey, the best bartender ever, and were absolutely amazing.   With that being said, Jeffrey is the most amazing in customer service and made us feel comfortable from the minute we walked into the bar. He was attentive and super helpful when decided what we wanted to eat and drink. He was even training at the same time with a full bar and made sure every person was taken care of. We came back twice specifically to see him.   We are so happy with our experience here and will definitely be back for the great food and great service!   Thank you Jeffrey!!",

I swear everything they make is from scratch and I found myself snapping pics of the food. The (in-house made) Granola bowl with fresh fruit and Greek yogurt was incredible. I'd list everything I ordered but seriously it was all so good just try pretty much anything on the menu. A shout out to Fuego for taking such good care of us.",

    "text": "Okay, so we start with the positive: great atmosphere, clean, decent service and it was free for me to eat the brunch buffet (25.00 for my boyfriend). Now the not-so-nice part (I really don't enjoy this, but if the bags torn, just rip it wide open): I'm glad it was free, cuz I would laugh in their faces for charging 25.00 pp. It was good, but not for 25.00 pp. Bacon, eggs, potatoes, pancakes, quesadillas, ironsteak sandwich, fruit salad, nachos, and quinoa stir fry. No drinks, nothing. Then the lighting at the \"buffet\" was so bad, it was hard to see what was what. Even some of the shorter guests had a hard time seeing what was in the servicers because they had them up too high. Then the tables...so crowded, they tried sitting me, my bf, and baby *in a car seat* next to a 400lbs dude that was blocking anyone from sitting anywhere near him. Then the bathroom situation....only baby changing station was all the way in the back, in the handicapped restroom.  No big deal, unless your employee spends 10-15min in there,  and only opened the door because you started banging on it. That leads to another question: who spends 10-15 min in the restroom, but it's not for pooping?  Hmmmm... oh, and the emergency fire exit was blocked by clutter. Did I mention the 3.00 bottle of water so I could feed my baby? I spoke to the nice young man there (who seemed to be in charge?  No one wore tags etc, and the head people all wore civilian clothes) he said he'd speak to the staff.",

We had the guacamole as an appetizer, and it was good. It comes with pomegranate seeds. The chilaquiles were ok. They seemed more like nachos with tomato sauce on top. The pork belly taco was very good, although I was not impressed with the tortillas. Overall, this dining experience was disappointing, but I will probably come back later when the restaurant has more of it's menu put together.",

The place is sort of hipster which threw me off, but it did not detract from the overall experience, or annoy me. I will definitely be back. Oh, and this place makes everything in house. Very fresh, savory, and filling. Decent tap beer selection too. Overall, I normally hate eating at hotel cafes, but this place was pretty amazing!!!",

We were seated right away for our reservation. Most of us ordered from the happy hour menu which made the food and drinks very affordable. Service was good the entire visit. I had deep fried avocados (very good), grilled chicken taco (over grilled and weak mole flavor), fish taco (good), traditional margarita (ok). The restaurant seemed sort of quiet. After dinner we found out why, There were many people taking advantage of the spring weather and live music on the rooftop. I would come back again if somebody wanted to meet up.",

    "text": "First, I'd like to preface by saying that I had no issues with the quality of the food. When I first discovered Cafe Tranquilo on Grubhub, I liked the La Peruana salad (with carne asada) so much, that I ordered it again the next day.   Secondly, I should add that that's the ONLY thing I've had from there, probably about four times now. So I'm relatively familiar with this specific lunch. It comes in two sizes, a large and a small, running $8-12 respectively.   So today I ordered the large salad again, sans asada. When I received my order, the container seemed smaller than I recalled. I measured the container out at 6.5 inches long, and decided to call and make sure that I had the correct size. Although I was assured it was rang up as a large (no duh), I could not get a straightforward answer about the size of the to go container.   I was told that I could be accommodated if I went in person, but the reason I order through Grubhub is that I generally can't leave my work. And though I was inclined to go down there just to prove a point, of course I dropped my car at the shop this morning. I was also told that even if it was wrong, they couldn't send another, and rather made it seem as if since I ordered through a service, that I would not get the same treatment as an in person customer. If that is the case, than perhaps Grubhub should not be an option.   I wasn't trying to get over on anything, or even have it replaced. A note for my next order would have been fine, IF it was even the case that I received the wrong one! But I don't know if it was or wasn't because my original question about the container was continually avoided.  However, I do know now from the gentleman that I spoke to, that the drinks and food are measured, and he has great trust for his people in the kitchen. So much so, they are apparently infallible to any possible human error, rendering my question ridiculous.",

First, we ordered the elote appetizer. 10 minutes later the waiter tells us they've run out. He offers to get us chips and salsa. Another 10 minutes later, we flag him down to get the chips and salsa. The spinach chop salad was horrible. Lightly dressed with something resembling water, it was almost inedible. I returned it and got the Caesar salad, which was ok, but I could have made a better one a grocery store salad bar. Shortly after sitting down a musician started playing in the bar area,and the sound carried so much we couldn't carry on with our conversation. All in all, a real disappointment. We told the manager, who gave us some free drink coupons...sorry, that doesn't make up for substandard food and service.",

When it changed to Cafe Tranquilo, I anticipated a few growing pains, and I tried to continue my loyalty, but it seems that frequently, when I go in, there is another change, to include the decor, menu, happy hour specials, staff, etc.  My most recent visit, today, was more of the same.  Now, they have 'counter service'.  So, I had to place my order at the host/hostess station, take a number, and have my food delivered to where I was sitting?  In the middle of taking our order, the host took a call and proceeded to take their order while making us wait.  Had to eventually go into the bar and have the bartender refill my water.  Also, was looking forward to having the pancakes, only to discover they no longer offer all day breakfast.  Way too many ongoing changes.  Not reliable at all.  I won't be going back.",

I'm huge into local, artisan,  and organic farm to table food with high quality meats and make it a huge priority in my diet.   I decided to stay at the Clarendon in part because of my research into the good scene at Phoenix and reading  the extremely good reviews of Tranquilo. I take yelp reviews with a grain of salt to manage my expectations, but Tranquilo completely blew my friend and I away with the impeccable kind service and extremely high quality value of delicious food. They use cast iron here , no microwaves and are proud to source their dishes from local farms and high quality butcher shops. Even without the free breakfast vouchers, the meals are an absolute steal for what you get. It made a very picky East Bay SF food snob very happy.  Jacob, the manager was super sweet and accommodating to my possibly strange requests. Jacob was super passionate about the food and incredibly welcoming to a new visitor. He told us where the food was sourced and gave all sorts of cool recommendations on other places around town.   I also love that they are gluten free friendly and have Grass fed beef. We are definitely getting breakfast there tomorrow!!!    I'm excited to come back to Phoenix with my boyfriend and friends  and stay at the Clarendon.   I am so impressed and surprised that Phoenix is now the place to go for high quality farm to table food without Bay Area prices!",

Limited food menu but what was there was awesome. Loved the vegetable tacos that were bursting with flavor! Flourless chocolate cake that melts in your mouth with decadent flavour while maintaining the fluffy texture was to die for! Guests loved the array of cocktails, wine, and beer selection available. Had plenty of space to mingle, take pictures, and enjoy the very talented live musicians seated nearby. The simple but lovely rooftop bar had a pretty view of Phoenix, strung up lights, live jazz music, and plush seats you can sink into. Drink and food prices were very reasonable given the classy feel of the space.",

    "text": "Out with one of my good friends - wondering where to go & thankfully our wandering took us here. I hadn't been to CF for awhile & had only gotten take out,  so ran in & out at lunchtime. Thankfully we got to go in, relax, enjoy the beautiful atmosphere & delicious food. We were greeted & promptly seated. The chairs comfortable, something I don't normally notice, cause most restaurant chairs aren't anything to write home about, but that was the start to a great experience. Comfort. Attentive service with a smile & knowledgeable staff. And I hadn't even eaten yet! We order the avocado fries (really!) with a wonderful dipping sauce, those disappeared quickly then we got our meals.  My friend got asada tacos & I got the Cuban inspired sandwich. My friend really liked her tacos, but was feeling the rice & beans were lacking. Can't please everyone & honestly we're pretty hard core about our mexican food. However my plate was absolutely delicious!  Cuban inspired, taken upwards. The bread was soft &perfect. Towering with meat & served with a side of tostones. What I loved is that this wasn't fluffed with fillers i.e., lettuce tomatoes,etc. And there no french fries. On the side because they're in the sandwich... Wonderful! My photo does it no justice. Everyone should try this & plan on taking some home for a late night snack, it's a lot of food. My waiter was awesome because he got a Dr Pepper for me (it wasn't on the menu) above & beyond service! I'm a fan.  We will be back with a crowd because I love taking people to wonderful places I've been so they can experience it too. Bonus, easy parking & its free.",

We started out with Bloody Mary's and the Elote Esquite, which came with chips and three salsas - avocado, tomatillo and ancho chili. If you're not sure what to start with, start there!! Amazing flavor! Next we ordered tacos - shrimp, pork belly, carne adovada and deshebrada roja. While small in size, they are giant in flavor! Our server Jacob was very welcoming, helpful with the menu and made sure our every need was met. We didn't have room for dessert but I can't wait to come back for cafe y flan.",

They had me at  tacos and tequila, who said tacos were only good on Tuesdays!?  $2 tacos and $5 Margaritas, yes please! I ordered the beer braised pork taco, a veggie taco, a margarita, a diet coke and a water, it's all about balance... The service was friendly and fast, maybe a bit too fast because I ordered before I saw the taco special listed on the board....Mango Habanero. Five minutes into the evening and  I was already filled with shame and regret... Thankfully the fabulous friends share, so I got a chance to try it, the panko breaded avocado fries drizzled with a jalapeno aioli, and the Kraken spiced rum...delicious! The beer braised taco was average, the veggie taco with sweet potato smear was surprisingly my favorite. Perfect sized tasty tacos, cheap drinks and good service made HH a success.  But for me what bumps Cafe' Tranquilo from a 3 to a 4 star is the roof top bar with a great view of the city, plenty of comfortable seating, a few tables so you can take your tacos with you, and the chill vibe of a live band.  AZ weather permitting this is the place to be...",

I'm sure I'll be going there again very soon!:)   We (me and my colleagues) went there for a happy hour on Friday evening. This was our first visit. Not at all impressive!! * The salsa and chips weren't complimentary. * Quesadillas were too dry. * No hot salsa. The one they call hot, weren't hot at all. * Very limited drink menu in happy hour. * Food options in all are limited.  Avocado fries were really good and fish tacos were good too.

I've been here a handful and don't see myself going back, I am always disappointed.  My daughter and I and a couple of friends went here for breakfast yesterday morning. I was promptly greeted by a  very nice woman and we were seated quickly. Unfortunately, the menu has very few options and is not kid friendly. Since their breakfast is a little pricey, I just ordered to Gringo Breakfast for my daughter and I to share, which was not enough food. In central phoenix, you generally don't get children's menus, but most places have an a la carte menu so the parents don't have to spend $11 for their little's. The food was okay. The eggs and bacon were cooked well, but the potatoes were bland and didn't have the best texture.   Overall, the service was good which is an improvement. I hope that the food selection and quality improves with the new management staff.",

    "text": "Service: 5 stars. Food: 4 stars. Since I was here for a company party, we had a private room. The food was pretty good, but most of the menu items were overpriced, in my opinion. The service was amazing, and the staff was very accommodating. One side comment is that soda was served in a can, along with a cup of ice. It didn't seem appropriate for a restaurant with above average prices.  APPETIZERS - The Elote Esquite was the best dish! Perfect for corn lovers. It's a corn salsa with cheese on top. Super sweet but delicious. The chips & salsa trio were average. The green chunky salsa tasted like straight-up lime, the red salsa was spicy, and the light green one was a creamy guacamole. The avocado fries were... interesting. Basically warm, mushy, deep-fried avocados. Other people liked it; I wasn't too fond of it as I'm not a big fan of avocados anyway. The guacamole was what you'd usually expect.  I got the carne asada burrito. It was delicious! I also had the horchata to drink which was pretty good. For dessert, I ate the flan brulee, which was a good finish.  There was live music in the restaurant, which provided a great ambiance. The rooftop on the fifth floor is open to the public, and there's live music there as well. I highly recommend checking it out!",

For entrees mom had a burger, sister had tacos, and I a veggie burrito. Everything was really good. This spot is really good looking. It's in the Clarendon Hotel, and has a great modern look with lots of large windows and outside seating. The atmosphere is good, there's music playing, there's a sybar on the top floor, and it's inside a really nicely decorated Hotel. Cafe Tranquillo is a great you can take anyone; family, a date, and have a good meal for a reasonable price. The Jolly diners rated this establishment at a 4.3 out of 5.",

    "text": "Ate here Saturday because my husband and I were staying at the Clarendon hotel and had breakfast vouchers. We had been at the hotel since late Thursday night and my husband started feeling really sick on Friday. Saturday morning we woke up and he was running a very high fever. There was no way he could go down to breakfast.  I went down with the vouchers and mentioned to the hostess how sick he was and asked about using his voucher to bring him a take-out order. She said she thought that would be okay and so I went and ordered my food.  I had the flapjacks and unfortunately they weren't cooked all the way through. It was like eating batter half-way through =\\ After my food I asked the waitress about a carry-out order. She told me in a clipped tone that the voucher was dine-in only and that she'd have to charge me for the take-out food. I explained the situation and she stared at me looking skeptical and said \"people say that ALL the time, but I'll go ahead and do it this time\".  I don't see why it's such a big deal for people to use the vouchers as carry out. We're staying at the hotel, it should count no matter what. My husband truly was sick and I didn't appreciate being \"doubted\" like that. We decided that next time, he'll just walk his sick-self down to your establishment and infect all the staff and guests with his sickness, since that apparently is preferable..",

After I moved I was wanting the salad again for dinner so I placed an order for pick up. When I got home I noticed the salad was more like a side salad than an entree. In addition they forgot to add my shrimp which was a $7 add on. I called the restaurant to let them know and they apologized and told me they would refund my money which never showed up in my bank account. I decided to give them another shot and ordered the same salad through UberEATS. Again, ingredients are missing and so is half of my salad. It definitely was not worth the $12. I'm disappointed that they think this is acceptable service.",

Ate there twice for breakfast and once for dinner, and found it affordable and tasty enough. The breakfast voucher totally covered my breakfast cost, and they give you one for each person in the room. $12.50 was totally enough per person. Patio seems very dog friendly. We also had drinks from the bar at night, totally satisfied. It's adorable, and the only criticism on that would be definitely trying too hard to hit all the \"hip\" points, becoming almost a parody. Whoever designed this hotel and restaurant has my vote to develop Hipster Disneyland - someone obviously created this place with a \"how to attract millenials\" handbook in their left hand. While definitely immediately noticing I was being heavily pandered to, I'd also say it was lovely. Servers seem incredibly stressed out, and forget little things. While I'm usually easily annoyed at that, it's clear its not the servers faults and this place is just getting started with their procedures and getting the flow of this place down. I would totally recommend this hotel and restaurant combo to friends.",

There had been ongoing construction for a while to revamp the place so I figured that's why is was slightly different when we walked in. It wasn't until our snooty waiter told us it was now Cafe Tranquilo and looked flustered when we were caught off guard. Our beers took forever to get to our table and when my husband's burrito arrived it was tiny! My pork belly taco was dry, the fish taco was yummy. I left feeling sad because we absolutely loved Gallo Blanco. It was our go to spot when we wanted tasty carne asada. We will not be going back. Gallo Blanco RIP :,(",

Music and lighting was really chill, would be a great place to meet a friend for dinner and/or catching up over drinks and dessert.  I sat at the bar (dined alone), ordered a taco and half order of posole.  The service was perfect.  I even had the opportunity to charge the dinner to my room which was very convenient.  The taco was really tasty and I'd come back for that, but the posole was just ok for me.  It wasn't the best I've had in Phoenix.  The broth, hominy, side ingredients were good but the pork was kind of terrible. It was cubes of hard pork. I'd rather have no pork than weird cubed pork. I'm thinking maybe they throw that in last, like when you order pho?  Either way, I'll be back and maybe just pass on the posole and definitely get tacos and a beer.  Also, I ran into some friends who were having a beer at the bar.  Super fun to have a local hotel restaurant/bar that is awesome enough that the locals hang out there too.",

All of the ingredients are fresh and the chefs know how to cook them. At dinner our server was Pedro and he was chipper, friendly and knowledgeable. He even knew what we were asking for when we asked him if we could get some Chiles Toreados (toasted jalapenos) on the side with a bit of beans & rice. Getting the special side was easy and the kitchen staff/cooks made the jalapenos just the way we like them. For my meal I ordered the Steak Special: 100% grass fed Rib Eye Steak (medium rare) w/Chimichurri sauce on top of grilled vegetables, served in a skillet. The meat was tasty and easy to slice into (like butter) and not over cooked, the vegetables were also cooked perfectly tasty and still slightly crisp. The sauce was merely an accent and not over powering at all.  My mom ordered the Chicken Mole and again it was cooked perfectly, juicy not dry and the mole sauce was spicy and not overly sweet like most. My aunt ordered the Fish Special, Salmon over vegetables. Again the salmon was cooked to perfection, slightly crispy on the outside, done on the inside but not dry at all. The vegetables were great as well.  Since we all finished our entire meals, we sadly had no room for desert. We also had Breakfast here as our room came with a $12.50 voucher for each person. There is no complimentary coffee in the lobby but you can purchase coffee or tea to go for $3.00 plus tax. The coffee and black tea were both quality, my mother and I are kind of picky about both. For breakfast I ordered the Chilaquiles with Chorizo instead of the listed Chicken or Vegetables, the Chilaquile sauce with the Chorizo made this dish the favorite of the morning. Rich with some spice but not overpowering, I could still taste the egg, chips and Oaxaxa cheese. My aunt had Eggs & Chorizo with beans and my Mom had the Huevos Rancheros served in a skillet both were very tasty with just enough spice. I also ordered the Greek Yogurt & Quinoa granola (to feel a little bit healthy), definitely worth going over my voucher amount. The fruit was freshly cut and the yogurt was soooo creamy. Our server at breakfast was named Fuego (obviously a nickname :), cheery and attentive.  As for bar drinks they were good but if I lived locally, I would probably get drinks elsewhere before hand (or after) and come here for the excellent food, vibe and service.",

So out with the old, and in with the new.   Downside: The bar area with the black walls, DEPRESSING. Put some artwork up, it's a bar, not a funeral. Also, the bar tender could try to smile once in a while, if your job is that awful man, don't do it.   Upside: The fish torta, my new favorite, and I really love the El Jefe, so grumpy pants bartending gets a few extra points because that drink is outstanding...   So give Tranquilo a whirl!",

Even with the happy hour price, the 1 thumb sized piece of fish with a couple other fingernail piece sized fish in there, it was not worth the money. It was not that tasty either and I've had ceviche in Peru and many Latin American countries. I just didn't have much flavor and the portion was sad.

Took a few minutes to be recognized and then when our name was taken, the people after us (with a similar party size) were seated before us. Waited about 10 minutes before a server, who honestly seemed rather out of it, seated us. She said she'd be back with menus and silverware. She never returned. Everywhere around us was hustling and bustling. We saw her, with menus in hand, go to other tables and into the kitchen. Many other servers passed us by. My sister even made eye contact with her to try to get her attention and she looked right at us and then walked back into the kitchen. We honestly felt invisible. After waiting about 15 minutes, after about another 10 minute wait despite there being visibly open tables, we left. At that point, we were starving and I had to get to the airport. Super disappointed but also really rude/unprofessional. I saw her on the way out and let her know we were leaving so feel free to give our table to someone else. She didn't even apologize she just stared at me and mumbled \"ok bye.\" What the heck?",

The weather was perfect  The staff was helpful and courteous. The meeting we had was productive. I suppose if you're on the rooftop bar level and needing to use a restroom then it's a little inconvenient to go down the elevator but not a big deal. Lots of seating areas for small or large groups and self serve water available at the bar was convenient. I enjoy the kitschy eclectic decor. While I was there they were hosting a silent auction in the lobby with various art pieces. I also learned a bit about some of the local history of the place which was interesting. Be sure to notice the statue bust in the lobby to learn more on that. It's worth repeating but I'm not repeating it here because I want everyone to go visit and learn it. Haven't been to the spa yet but I think I'd enjoy it! Putting that on my things to do list",

My husband and I decided to enjoy a Saturday evening happy hour before going to the movies.    Tranquilo Cafe was the place to go for an amazing happy hour, not any more.    The drink menu was margaritas (standard), selected wines and beers.  Now the drink menu has gotten a lot shorter, scarce and more $$.   The food selection was about ten appetizers that were  half price on the happy hour menu.   Now the food selection has shrinked... Oh My!   The kicker is the TACOS... They were half off but now they only serve the tacos half price on Tuesday!  To some people this isn't a big deal but to people who make happy hour a seque to dinner, this is a huge deal.   When customer service was excellent and now I'm sitting at a table holding a menu for 20 mins before someone even noticed I didn't order.    That's a PROBLEM....  Most restaurants know a way to your customers heart is to  keep True to roots and maintain the quality of EXCELLENCE you started with! Not to dminish the quality and then ask for more money$$$!

The Happy Hour Menu is 7 days a week from 3pm to 7pm, and has $2 tacos! Hello!! It doesn't even have to be Taco Tuesday to get $2 tacos! Oh sweet!  This review is for the few times I have been.  Ordered the Elote Esquite for starters, its Mexican street style corn off the cob with ancho peppers and cotija cheese seared on cast iron skillet, it also comes with chips & a trio of salsa. This elote corn dip was delish and gone before we knew it, can't wait to go back for more!  The Tacos! They are like street tacos  and have homemade taco shells and I have tried the following:  The taco special was a pork belly with habanero mango, to me, this was one was ok; I was expecting more of a sweet kick with it being habanero mango, so it was little on the mild side.  Had a fish taco and its Tecate beer battered white fish and it was a pretty tasty taco  Of course I had to have a carne asada taco, it's a chimichurri ribeye steak, and this too was a good tasting taco! Yum!  My favorite taco, which surprised me was the veggie taco, it has a sweet potato mash as the base and seasonal veggies, this time it was onions & mushrooms, so delsih! I need to order more soon!  If you find yourself lookin for some great grub during Happy Hour, go give Cafe Tranquilo a try!",

With a favorable happy hour menu until 7pm that serves up $2 grilled shrimp tacos and $5 margaritas you are in for a fun inexpensive time. Friendly, attentive, quick service are pleasing factors when dining out and this spot offers it all while maintaining its chic trendy vibes. I would definitely want to go back to try more of their delicious artfully crafted street tacos like the shredded beef deshebrada marinated in Mexican coke, chili rojo, garlic and chipotle crema. Muy delicioso!",

I think they have this promotion throughout other days of the week but I cannot remember... sorry!  The tacos were good with the promotion, but I wouldn't want to pay more as the taste is not that great. The drinks are strong, I'll give them that. We also had Guacamole for the table with chips and that was alright.   I checked in on yelp and was presented with a discount. When the check was dropped I showed it to our server and she said she had never seen it before and had to consult her manager. They discounted the check but the demeanor she had was that she was annoyed.  Overall service was good and the location is very convenient for my friends and I to meet at. The food though wasn't so good that I would go out of my way to come to this location though.",

I ordered three and my coworker got five (they are small tacos and he's a big dude haha). I had a shrimp taco, carne asada taco, and a pork taco. He ordered two carne asada tacos, a shrimp taco, fish taco and a veggie taco. I wish I had better things to say about Cafe Tranquilo... but the food was not impressive. The restaurant itself was cute but nothing spectacular, and overall not worth the visit.  Out of the 5 varieties of tacos we ordered, the only ones we actually liked were shrimp, fish and veggie. The carne asada tacos were bland and the pork taco was also lacking in flavor, and even worse, it was soggy! The shrimp and fish tacos were flavorful due to chipotle aioli and fancy crema, but without these sauces I don't think the tacos would be any good.  There are far too many great Mexican restaurants in Phoenix to eat mediocre tacos. I won't return.  + avocado salsa very tasty + $2/taco all month long (Feb.2017) + shrimp and fish tacos were good - chips and salsa are not complementary - no spicy salsa or hot sauce available - carne asada and pork tacos were meh",

    "text": "I almost feel like writing this review might be unfair.  I literally feel like family here.  I started coming here some time in 2015.  Fell in love with the awesome pancakes and started coming more regularly to enjoy pancakes and tacos.  But some where in the year, I started inviting friends to meet me on the roof top for cocktails, or when I scored a pool pass, I would invite friends to join me at the pool to hang out and eat food, or I would bring my laptop and sip coffee and work.    I've never been to a more welcoming establishment!  The one thing I will say about Cafe Tranquilo, and the Clarendon, in general, is that the staff goes above and beyond to give you the most amazing service possible. I could list so many instances in which their service was simply amazing, I will share 2.  My A/C broke last year.  I wasn't sure that it would be repaired that night.  I called and stopped by the front desk to see if they had rooms, explained I wanted to give the repair guys a little longer, but I might be back.  An hour later, I get a phone call from the Claredon's front desk asking if I was ok, and did I still want to come back.  I was shocked that they would take the time to call!  Fortunately, that night, the A/C guys had just notified me that they were about to switch my AC back on.    I stopped in recently, and this inspired my review update....  I pull out my laptop to work in the lounge.  My server, Falyn, stops by to take my food order.  I say... \"Hmmm, I saw some one with cheese fries and chorizo the other day, I could go for something like that...\". Falyn simply said, \"if we have the ingredients, we can make it, no worries!  I'll bring that right out.  want anything else on it like sour cream?\".  Oh, and it was so delicious... so guilt-inducing delicious.  Those fries were the most amazing comfort food.    I'm sorry folks, but I go to a lot of restaurants, I co-host a supper club for Pete's sake, and it is rare that you find a restaurant that will go off script/menu for you like this!  Rare to find a hotel that will personally phone you, when you haven't actually confirmed a reservation, to let you know they were holding a room for you just in case.  Oh the JOY!  Return Factor:110% I love this place",

    "text": "It's tricky writing a review of Cafe Tranquilo and not letting your personal feelings cloud your judgment.   You see, this particular spot previously housed a little place known as Gallo Blanco. The flavor of their tacos, particularly their carne asada, is forever burned in my memory. As a result, I have to remind myself to not compare these people to a place that no longer exists, at least not for the time being. It's simply just not fair.  With that out of the way, Cafe Tranquilo is a neat little hotel-based establishment that focuses on Latin-American cuisine. We stopped by one late afternoon to try some of their offerings. The place was empty for some odd reason - which was in stark contrast to the last time I was in this same dining room three years prior.  Their chips and salsa were excellent quality, with three variations being provided. Additionally, we ordered some tacos, including pollo, asada, pork, and fish. All were fine for what they were, although still not eh . . . never mind. Beans and rice were also all right.  Honestly, I don't know. Taco standards have significantly gone up in recent years to the point where I feel like I might have to return here and dive a little deeper into their menu to find out what they're all about.   It won't \"wow\" you - but it won't really make you wince either.  Give them a try at least - as I do feel they at least deserve a fair chance.",

Moving onto the food. Hubby ordered the chilaquiles. Their chilaquiles was not only beautifully plated, it was delicious. Had a mixture of if chicken and fresh vegetables. The green salsa was prepared fresh. I had a butter and was blown away how good it was. I ordered the granola fruit bowl. It's a big parfait. Beautifully served in a big bowl.

After I didn't like my drink, I brought it back to the bartender full, and he charged me for a new one! I served in college and was shaken with this news. When a customer hasn't liked their food or drink, I FIXED IT. Then when I returned to my table the waitress told my friend and I that we had to leave because she needed our table. She didn't offer to move us, and she didn't ask if we could move- she told us. We were eating an appetizer at this table, It was so bizarre! \"Why you gotta be so mean?\" - Taylor Swift. What an unfriendly hotel restaurant. I would never invite any of these people to a birthday party. I'm usually pretty upbeat and funny in my Yelp reviews but this experience just made me sad.",

I consistently like the food, the rooftop view is always amazing, and I love when they have live music. The customer service is what varies. Sometimes the staff is friendly and quick, but the last couple times have been subpar at best. First, it is really frustrating that not all of happy hour or the menu applies to the roof deck. Usually they are cool about letting you order downstairs and bringing it upstairs, but last time the bartender downstairs gave us a lot of attitude. He then also forced us to close our check, because he was leaving. As if that should dictate when we close out? That is not normal practice, and he was just fishing for a tip after being rude to us. Another recent time I went, our server dropped off menus and never came back, so after 20 minutes we just left. And it was not even busy. Thus, hit or miss here.",

    "text": "Located on 4th Ave just north of Osborn, Cafe Tranquilo is the Clarendon Hotel's restaurant (inside the old Gallo Blanco space).  The change in management/ownership was pretty recent--and sudden--but my family was in the mood for Mexican food so we decided to check it out.  Bottom line:  no, it's not the same as Gallo and I think they're still working out the kinks, but I'll be back.  We ordered chips and salsa to start.  The chips are thick and crispy and come with four different salsas.  The creamy avocado one was our favorite by far, but the green/tomatillo salsa was nice as well.  The spicy red salsa was OK but a bit too smoky in flavor; I thought it could use some citrus or something else to balance it out.  Pico de gallo was the last of the four and seemed like it had been made up a day before and didn't keep well; it was not much beyond what you'd get at a grocery store -- edible but nothing special.  We still inhaled a ton of chips and finished off most of the salsa, though.    For main dishes, I ordered three tacos: 1 chicken, 1 shrimp, and 1 grilled vegetable.  I thought all were good, but it would have been nice to get some lime wedges (or some of the red and green sauce bottles that Gallo used to have).  My mom ordered the Ensalada Peruana, and was underwhelmed.  To be fair, the first ingredient listed on the menu is quinoa, but it was too heavy on the quinoa and the vinaigrette wasn't really noticeable, making the dish kind of bland.  (I tried a bite and agreed with her.)  My brother ordered a cheeseburger and fries with horchata to drink and liked it all.  They didn't have a printed drink menu yet and only had about 4 or 5 mixed drinks to offer, but I'm sure that will be developed with time.  I'd also like to see more agua fresca options be offered in the future.",

Disappointed that the cevice was shrimp and not fish, and it lacked a little heat, but nothing a little hot sauce and a squeeze of the lime on the rim couldn't fix. The pork taco was a little bland, but the green salsa fixed that right up. It was cooked properly.  Because I'm an optimist, I wanted to rank 3.5, but gave it a 4. I would definitely come back.  Though.... I was a bit disappointed that they had run out of margarita mix. Would have expected limes, simple syrup, and some orange liqueur.... But hey, in the spirit I just got the shot of tequila with lime. I think they felt bad enough I got a double.",

The decor & theme were on point and looked beautiful against the Arizona sunset.  Each course had a matching beer chosen to compliment the meal it went with.  My personal favorite was the Java Stout Float for dessert! The staff were excellent in timing the courses, as well as describing the dish a few times for the guests that were distracted.  Every person that attended the dinner left saying that it was a very unique and delicious food experience they will talk about for the rest of their lives.  Definitely the perfect way to start off our celebratory weekend!! A huge thank you to Nicki, Vince, Joe & the rest of the staff at Cafe Tranquilo for making it such an unforgettable experience!",

The tacos were really good also.  I agree with some of the other reviews about the shrimp tacos not having a whole lot of flavor to them but there are so many other dishes that were really tasty.  Also, the drinks were tasty too...especially with so many places downtown serving crappy margaritas.  The service was excellent.  I had the flan and I was a fan.  I generally like slightly denser flans and this one was the way I like it.  I also tried the shrimp ceviche on another night and was a fan.  Good happy hour deals.  The kicker for me was that we were expecting jacked up prices for being attached to a hotel, but these were some of the most reasonable prices we encountered in Phoenix, especially after having eaten at a few places downtown.",

The interior of the restaurant is also very boring in fact it needs some help it's bland brown the ceiling is awful with pipes exposed that are dirty. The entire place just needs some soap and water and some elbow grease.  I've been visiting the Clarendon since 2005 and I must say overtime the restaurant has gone from a high-end French restaurant to Gallo Blanc to now this. Overall it's sad.

Their Happy Hour is a great deal for sure! Staff is very nice and attentive.",

We ordered the bottomless chips and salsa, as well as the quac. Although bottomless, we never received a refill on our chips. The fish tacos and fries were tasty. We ordered the Chocolate Tres Leches cake and it was the worst Tres Leches I have ever had. Dry and hard. The  tres leches was pooled at the bottom of the bowl instead absorbed into the cake. The margarita that my friend had was heavily served over a glass filled to the brim with ice. When she asked if she could have less ice, our server told her that everything was measured appropriately. If you are staying in the hotel go for a matter of convenience. If you aren't, don't make the trip.",

My friend ordered the chopped salad (was real good), and  we each ordered the chicken taco. All tacos came on one big plate. The chicken taco was moist but bland..I got the pork belly taco (very over-cooked (some pieces were hard to chew crispy and not in a good way!) and lacked seasoning. My friend got a shrimp taco and there was only one sad little shrimp on her taco, it was also kind of meh.. This was a pretty disappointing lunch..used to be a great location and we had great expectations out of the chef/restaurant combo!",

I finally made it out to CT when invited by a friend a couple weeks ago. Unfortunately it wasn't all that exciting. I understand the concept of 'modern Mexican' food and appreciate that in general it is more complex than your typical Mex fare and therefore more expensive. This food was more expensive than your typical restaurant, but seemed fairly basic. I got the carne asada burrito, and it was very small and came with no sides for 8$. There was nothing special about it.... just meat, beans, cheese, and avocado. It was fairly bland and didn't warrant its price tag. I luckily had ordered chips and salsa (for 3.50) and had a very very minuscule amount of salsa to put on said burrito to give it some flavor. Back to the chip situation.... if I pay almost 4$ for chips, I would think they would give refills on the teeny tiny cups of salsa, especially because their basket of chips was quite generous.... this was not the case ( or at least wasn't on the night we were there). The salsas were good, with the green salsa being my favorite. Anyway, I just don't see the need to go back to this establishment when there are other 'modern Mexican' places in town that do a much better job of making their food feel special.",

We stayed two weeks at the Claredon and got free breakfast daily, by the end of the week we started getting bored.  Drinks: I had a few cocktails at the bar and poolside. One cool thing is they let you double any drink for 1/2 more. i.e. $15 gets you 2x $10 drinks combined! Cocktails I liked were the Mezcal one, and the margarita with St. George Spirits Raspberry Liquor.  I think the bar is this places best asset. They do drinks really well, and it is a chic atmosphere.  Food: Well I'm super picky. That's what living in the bay area does to you. We had breakfast every day here for two weeks and I tried almost all of the menu. The pancakes are really awesome, so was the scramble, but only because I asked for them to custom make me something. I would ask for bell peppers, onion, cheese, chorizo, and it would taste amazing. The secret: they add taco seasoning to the eggs! Highly recommend you do that.   The chilaquiles and huevos rancheros were both disappointing. The chilaquiles for some odd reason had carrots in it! Didn't exactly go with eggs. Their scramble off the menu - spinach and mushroom was also pretty boring. These guys could be a 4 star on food if they gave the chef some creative freedom and added more stuff to the breakfast menu. They have 8 items; not a lot of selection..... it would be super easy to add omelets for example.   The saving grace: good coffee. The coffee both warm and cold brew iced was awesome!",

I ordered from them through postmates based on reviews and their food did not disappoint. However, my postmates driver did not deliver me the correct order. I called the restaurant to see if my food was still there, not only did they apologize, but the manager personally delivered my food. How awesome is that!?!?! Phenomenal service and absolutely delicious food! I highly recommend checking out this place, it's more than worth it!",

They did take away the kids menu, which with us having two kids was a bit of a blow, but we were able to get our kids items that they liked on the happy hour menu. Definitely worth checking out!!",

The free bingo on the rooftop was hilarious and fun, but the food, drinks and service was just \"okay\". I ordered two cocktails and the bartender had to take the drink menu from me and use it as an instruction manual for the drinks I ordered. The drinks tasted fine, but it now makes sense why the line was incredibly long because he had to look up each cocktail.   We ordered the elotes, avocado fries and chips and guacamole. It all tasted good, but again nothing out of this world.   Overall I will definitely keep coming to the live entertainment each week, but will probably eat before and stick to beer or wine.",

The waitress was super friendly and helpful when taking our order and was prompt with drinks.   I ordered the carne asada burro which came with fries. The meat in the burrito was actually really well cooked, fresh, and tasty. I like that the tortilla was toasted and still warm when the food was brought out to us. It was super messy and tough to eat, but still good and definitely worth having.  The price was super inexpensive for what we got (two meals and an alcoholic drink), only about $24. The only downside is that the service was a little slow on as far as getting the actual food out goes, and there were a few things we asked for but never got.  But I would come here again for sure.",

Sounded amazing. Nope. Bowl of coleslaw. I got it mainly for the kale and there were (no exaggeration) two pieces of kale. The dressing was supposed to be jalapeno and it had absolutely no flavor. And on top of that the prices were ridiculous for what you get. 10 dollars for a bowl of Cole slaw?!   The atmosphere is what getting the star.

I ordered a watermelon water which was good too but in a small cup. This was around 6pm.  The next time I went around 8pm I was excited to order the same thing along with an appetizer I got chips and salsa the chips were so stale and hard to eat. The burrito was so tiny!!! Both halves fit in my hand. No sides were given and I ordered the watermelon water which was a normal sized cup. Needless to say my bf and I did not get full and had to eat somewhere else after. The service was slow and barely paid attention to us. I am very disappointed with the service and food. I am never going back",

    "text": "Clarendon's controversial concept for cultivating Chicano cuisine offers conventional dishes, with a little bit of the unique flair that makes the executive chef a bit of a local celebrity. And while your taste buds won't be left bored, I can't exactly promise Tranquilo will hit the spot.   I was excited to give this place a try, especially after giving them a few weeks to work through any inconsistencies. I decided to go with something modest and simple. Here goes:   Carne asada burrito: The gold standard of casual Mexican fare. The meat used was clearly of above-average quality, but the choice in seasoning was conspicuously sweet. Almost like some sort of BBQ sauce. That would totally kick ass in taco form, but IDK about how it meshed with very strong, tangy cotija, and some of the saltiest pico I've ever had. No really, that salsa needs to be toned down. I am surprised at how poorly it was executed considering your other salsas (one's avocado, the other is...chipotle?) are absolutely legit. BTW, please make an effort to warm up your tortillas. Another BTW, this dish is a healthy portion size, meaning the average American should be prepared for something a bit small.   Jicama cucumber slaw: This is more of a palate cleanser than a side dish. Looked cool, sounds cool, but IDK what they wanna do with this. It's just a crunchy, slightly sweet, forgettable little bowl of nothingness. Boring.   Margarita: Damn good for $6. 10/10 would drink again.  Service is also pleasant (bravo for fixing this, Clarendon) and swift. I think this place has potential, and that way too many people are trashing it on Yelp because they can't stop crying about its predecessor taking off. But while diners who miss their old haunt aren't quite ready to put away the tissue, this is at the very least worth a try, so that they may fine-tune the flavors of affordable, quality food to become a worthy CenPho competitor.",

    "text": "I loved it when it was Gallo Blanco, but like all good things; it doesn't last.  I came here with a large group of one Friday night to now Cafe Tranquilo.  The place was pretty hip looking, but the crowd was nowhere to be found.  The place was quiet, too quiet for a Friday night.  As I sat I ordered a beer and like most Southwestern style restaurants chips and salsa was served with four different salsas; Pico de Gallo, Red Chili, Green Chili and creamy avocado.  My favorites were the Red and Green Chili; love the kick and the chips seemed like fresh cut tortillas fried...definitely nice start!  For my entree I shot for the Campechana Ahogada; a torta sandwich with ribeye steak, chorizo, avocado, tomato, cheese, eggs and a red sauce.  Definitely a larger dish then I expected.  The bun was nicely toasted, but protein ratio was definitely way off; maybe 2 cups of ribeye compared to a 8 inch bun.  The tomato didn't really add anything special except that is was there; if they were planning to give it some texture then that didn't help.  The egg was a nice compliment, but in the end it just wasn't enough.  I think a little more texture and something to compliment the red sauce would have made it work. - Enjoy!",

I also ordered the fresh, squeezed OJ on a separate occassion, which was honestly the best fresh OJ I've had. I could appreciate the fact they used thick cut bacon. My breakfast entree also came with an array of salsas which I could pair with my eggs or potatoes. For dinner, I ordered the cuban sandwhich. It was crafted so well. Although it was a bit pricey for a sandwich, I would definitely order it again. I also got the watermelon agua fresca which was a nice addition to the dinner meal. This restaurant gives good quality service and also has specials during the weeknight and weekends. You can also enjoy live music on Thursday nights which I definitely did.",

They also contacted Uber Eats support for me! The restaurant also had their own courier deliver my food at no charge. They went above and beyond and I am forever grateful. At the end of our conversation the manager of Cafe Tranquilo said, \"may this be the best burrito you've ever eaten\". She wasn't kidding. It was the best chicken burro I have EVER enjoyed and will be ordering from them again.   Uber Eats also followed up with me, refunded my money and gave me a promo code toward my next meal.

A small mound of greek yogurt was piled high on top with quinoa granola and plenty of fresh fruit, then drizzled with honey, and finally finished off with a very generous dollop of whipped cream. I actually thought that the bowl would have been better without the crema, but everything else was delicious.

The server. recommended the Chorizo con Huevos  which I was a bit hesitant to order since chorizo can be very greasy.  She said that it was from a local company and was very good.  She was right.  The chorizo was perfectly seasoned and not greasy and came with homemade tortillas, potatoes and beans. For $7!!!  Can't wait to try dinner.",

But there wasn't anything on the menu I could eat.  In situations like that, I usually will just ask for a hard boiled egg or an omelette made in a separate pan and this has never been an issue in my life. But here, they only make hard boiled eggs at lunch. And they only make omelettes on the weekend. And they only have good customer service on days that don't end in 'y'. According to our waiter, they stick to \"basic egg cooking methods.\"   So I got poached eggs that tasted like vinegar. I didn't finish them. My husband is not a picky eater at all and he said his meal was soggy and bad. The service was pretty bad .... We asked for refills on tea and they never came .... Even though we had vouchers for free breakfast, we never went back.  (My husband did order dinner twice while at the pool and he said both meals were fine then. So I'm assuming there are different people working at night.)",

I was there less than a month ago to celebrate my little big girl's birthday with yummy crepes. Today she said, \"Mommy Yummy Crepes!\" Sad sad sad face.    So here's the good, coffee is still great. As a self-confessed addict, that is a must for any breakfast restaurant. The mimosas are quite nice, not too much orange juice if you know what I mean!  The corn tortillas still have that homemade kind of feel, but they need to be cooked longer. The chorizo and eggs were tasty enough and I especially enjoyed the whole beans.   Here's the bad, potatoes. Not sure what was going on there. They are small itty bitty diced things. So small that when fried, they are basically just hard bits of greasy crunch. They had random slices of onions and peppers mixed in as an after thought which were cooked al dente compared to the over cooked pototoes.   The service wasn't what I was used to from before. Not particularly friendly. Could be that they were stressed over the latest turn of events. But the place was half empty and it took forever to get our food. Seems if the new place wants to garner favor, they should have been warmly warming up my coffee. No such luck.  As this is one of my go to neighborhood places, I'm hoping Clarendon gets it together. I'll be keeping an eye on yelp and see if it improves.",

The tacos are just ok- chewy bland meat, dry chicken, overly salted everything. I decided to give it another try today despite our bla first visit, because I REALLY wanted to like it. My husband ordered the Pollo Asado platter and the chicken breasts, pounded super flat, were dry as a bone! He ate about three bites and was done. I had a salad, which was fine- but it's a salad- you don't have to cook salad. We ordered two desserts which came with ice cream. When they brought out the dessert, we asked about the ice cream and the server went to check - coming back to say they \"don't even sell ice cream.\" I pointed to the specials board in the back of the restaurant and it clearly said \"with ice cream.\" To this she replied, \"oh yeah we have to erase that.\" The brownie dessert was so bad- I mean dry as a bone crumbly terrible bad. I'm pregnant and eat almost anything- especially chocolate brownie- and I wanted nothing to do with this thing. Maybe the ice cream could have hidden it. On top of everything, the service was SO painfully slow for the restaurant being near early. After we ordered, it took almost thirty minutes to get our food and another thirty after that between waiting for dessert, check, etc. The first thing I did after my meal was text another foodie friend to tell her to stay away! So so so sad :(",

From the start the host Marshall was very rude. I always give people the benefit of the doubt because I've worked in customer service and sometimes people just have bad days but his attitude was unacceptable. We had a party of 7 that was staying at the hotel come down for breakfast. This was apparently this was too much for him to handle. He sat us outside in the direct sun (which he didn't ask if this was ok and its June in Phoenix) and the tables we extremely hot. We had to sit at two different tables which we were ok with but once more tables opened up inside we asked him if we could put some together and he just walked away from us when we asked the question. At this point one of us went to the front desk to complain about this issue but they did not do anything to resolve it. The whole time he made it seem like we were the rude ones. I felt extremely uncomfortable.  We did have an amazing waitress Jessa who jumped in and made sure our table was taken care of. She was the only part of the experience that was worth mentioning.  With all this said I will probably not go back to the restaurant when we stay again.",

The chilaquiles plate was very delicous.  The watermelon cooler drink was refreshing and superb on a hot June day.  I only rate 4 stars for two reasons:  one of the newer waitresses didn't seem very interested in our table but I saw the others were hustling and later was informed the waitress was in training.  And secondly the temperature near the window was very warm.  If you are interested in trying some freshly prepared and interesting and scrumptious cuisine in a cute environment, I highly recommend.
