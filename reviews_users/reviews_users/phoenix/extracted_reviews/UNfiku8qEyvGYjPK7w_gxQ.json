Gertrude's is an excellent, full-service restaurant on the grounds, but if you want to get in at dinnertime, you will need to MAKE RESERVATIONS EARLY!!!  We found out the hard way, but the alternative was really nice as well.  We got their box lunches for our dinner.  They weren't cheap ($32.50 for two), but each of us had a delicious and complete meal for that price.  Each box contained a BIG wrap (mine vegetarian), a container of cole slaw (I think there were other choices for side dish), an apple, and a drink.  We ate them on their patio outside on picnic tables.  (Not in the restaurant's outdoor serving area.)",

We had 5 small children and he was attentive and helpful.  The food came a little slow because they were busy bit that was the only negative.  I ordered calamari (yummy), beet salad (great to have 2 sizes avail) and the chili (hearty and tasty)!!  Would like to go back on a date with my husband (sans kids) ;).",

Can't decide if I want to laugh or cry about all the comments from people who can't find it - really- it's right smack at the entrance to the Desert Botanical Garden - how could you miss it?  There is only one entrance and you can see the umbrellas, lights, people eating and hear all the noise that comes from an open air restaurant.  Really stunned that the location is an issue for anyone.",

Which was awesome because we showed up in the middle of Their rush. As we are getting seated on a beautiful patio, with desert flowers and a fountain in the center of the courtyard. I ordered the Brussels and breakfast. A new twist on the classic toad in the stool (hollowed out slice of bread with an egg cooked inside.) Briosh toast, sauteed in more butter, an egg yolk lightly sauteed on the bottom. Served on top was fresh picked Brussels sprout leaves, sauteed in butter with house made bacon lardons, onion jam and banyuls vinegar was used to deglaze the pan. A crispy strip of bacon stuck out of the bread. So freaking money! You don't expect the sweetness of the onion jam and vinegar to go with egg, but they got it down! The serving staff is very informed about the products they use. I'd go back again, probably for dinner this time. See the garden at night.",

After ordering our food, we waited 40 mins for our breakfast and it never arrived.It wasn't busy at all and there was plenty of staff standing around chatting.We asked someone to check on our order and was given a vague response of it will be out soon. 10 mins later still no food, no refills on our drinks. We decided to cut our losses and leave so flagged down someone we think was the manager and explained we wanted to cancel our food order and why. He didn't seem the least bit concern instead was very curt and rude to us about our request and stormed away. No apology or explanation was given to us for why there was such a long delay from this man. We finally were able to get our waitress's attention and told her to cancel our food and we paid for our drinks and left. The waitress did apology for the long wait l but 40 mins for an egg breakfast is a ridiculous wait time when it's not busy in a restaurant. Although the ambiance is great, I don't recommend eating here. Maybe just drinks would be fine.",

We started with grilled asparagus and although some of the asparagus was very thin and burnt on some of the ends, the fried egg on top was a great addition and we would order this side again. We also had as a starter the whole grain with white quinoa; this was an excellent starter dish full of flavor and seemingly very healthy with sort of a blueberry taste. The King salmon was well prepared and the green mole sauce was very good addition. The only downfall was, the charge of 6$ for bread, although the bread was good and had the addition of grapes and rosemary baked in, I would not pay for the bread plate again. Gertrude's is open to the general public and does not require Desert Botanical Garden membership or admission, just check in at the gate.",

My dad had the green chili which he said was good but it had some heat to it.  My mom wanted the pork belly tacos but they had run out of tortillas. The waitress failed to mention this at the very beginning which would have been helpful when we were looking at the menu. My mom ended up getting the hot dog that she said was very good. I had the chicken sandwich that was also very good. We also had the flourless chocolate cake that was divine!!  The gelato was also very good and tasted good with the chocolate cake. You have to order the chocolate cake when you order your food because it takes 30 minutes to make. It was a beautiful day to sit outside and the food was really good. My parents had a great day so I'm giving Gertrude's five stars!",

    "text": "Meh... I'll give Gertrude's three stars. It was a busy, warm day when we went there. The food was pretty good, as well as, cocktails and met our needs for being hungry at a tourist trap, but I'll save my postcard to Mom & Dad.... We had the homemade bread, which while good, didn't seem to taste as fresh to me as \"homemade\" (rather hard inside/out), but maybe they make it a day before.... We split a burger, which was large and flavorful and did come with a generous portion of fries. However, I was unimpressed w/the service and the manager.  The waitress did the minimum, but there wasn't much memorable about her. (I think she was probably over her head w/tables to be honest.)  My hubs waited probably 15 min. for his cocktail, which arrived at the same time as our entree.  I mentioned this to the manager and she apologized and said she'd go check \"right now\" and then proceeded to uproot a table of four Seniors (who had been sitting at their table probably 10 min. still w/out drinks) across the restaurant to make room for a party of eight. They were nicer than I would have been... No offer to comp anything or chance for them really to say no, just this is the deal, so up and Adam, Seniors! Chop! Chop! Then we heard her apologizing to two other tables, as well. Again, no comps or really any offers to make it right, just kind of a big smile w/a sorry to hear this type comment. Which is fine, I guess, but it's also probably not so great when other customers can hear this going on over and over... She did, however, come back to check on my hubs drink 10 min. after I asked... Like I said, a decent meal (food-wise) for an hour stop w/in our day, but I don't think I'd truly, overwhelmingly recommend or eat there again. Food tasting well is one thing, but customer service is certainly just as important too!  Just my $1.25....",

Suspect it waited for 1/2 hour for our other dishes to be finished. When we called the attention of one of the servers (our server never checked in to see how things were)  the response was lackadaisical at best. The plate was removed, slightly warmed, somehow, subsequently the meat now was twice cooked, and 1/2 the beans were gone...There wasn't a colorful item on the plate...beige, cold. The other meal was ordered as the salmon entree, what arrived was the salmon salad, tasty, but not what was order, and we were charged for the entree, but were too hungry to send it back and unfortunately missed the overcharge. The chicken sandwich was the only correct meal, warm, tasty. We frequent the DBG, have been members for years, but Gertrud's, never again. I'll pick up a Sonic burger next time on they way to the Garden, save a chunk of change, and have a hot meal as ordered.",

When we walked in to eat, I thought \"I am going to feel so out of place\" it looked so classy and upscale. I thought for sure they were going to give us that \"what are you doing here look\". Boy was I wrong. The hostess was very kind and friendly. She made us feel very comfortable. She told us the wait would be about 20 min. We got in in 10 and she apologized for making wait. I asked if we could be seated out on the patio and she took us to what she called the best seats in the house because of their view of \"Chihuly\" The Nature of Glass scupture, which was impressive. Our waiter came over a short time later and treated us very well.  He was patient and explained what some of the menu items were. We ended up ordering burgers and fries. THE BEST BURGER AND FRIES I HAVE EVER EATEN!!! I swear.( They use local produce and farms for their food, so their menu changes often depending on what is available locally). It was amazing. It didnt even need ketchup, which I always put on hamburgers. It was seasoned perfectly as were th french fries. Crispy and very lightly seasoned. Perfect food. There was a pickle on the side as well which they had to have pickled themselves. It reminded me of the pickles my grandmother used to make. I could have just eaten those and been happy. I ordered iced tea as well, and it too needed no sweetener. The lemon was more than enough. This place was incredible. It is a little pricey. The burgers were $14 each. More than I would normally spend on a burger.......maybe not if they all tasted like that one. I know I will never get a great tasting burger like that anywhere else.  The entire staff was so friendly and made us feel comfortable and right at home. Thank you Gertrude's. When we come back to AZ, you will be on our list of restaurants to visit.",

    "text": "It's a little spot within the Desert Botanical Gardens. You should make reservations or risk waiting a long time.  Their menu looks delightful, unfortunately, if you don't partake in meat, you will be disappointed. Even one of the fish dishes comes with meat, which our server informed us couldn't be changed.  My fish dish was ok. Before you gag, just know that some fish has worms in the meat, but if cooked thoroughly, it's fine. You've probably eaten hundreds of them without noticing. I did notice 2 small, dead worms in my fish, but since the fish was slightly rubbery, I assumed it was overcooked, and thus the meat was fine. That stuff doesn't bother me.  I ordered the side of potato salad as well. I don't know why, but I'm not a big fan of the big chunk potato salad, or the al dente style...i like it a bit more soft.  The window were open and some flies are expected, but it was a bit too much. Way too many flies landing all over the food and tables.  Service was fine, nothing special. Prickly pear margarita was the highlight of the meal.  Glad we tried it, but won't be repeating.",

We had spent a couple hours walking the Desert Botanical Gardens (100 degrees) and were ready for refreshments.  A place can have good food to excellent food, but service makes or breaks the experience for me.  We were there to celebrate a birthday and our group ordered: Chicken wrap $15.00 - delicious Breakfast bowl $12.00 - delicious Gertrude's burger $17.00 - delicious American breakfast $12.00- very good with the sausage  Top it off was a wonderful Happy Birthday dessert with ricotta donuts and sauces, definitely order this.  Drinks: Garden Rita $10 Tombstone tea $8 Desert Rose $9  Thank you for making this birthday celebration so special!  We loved the food and the experience.",

    "text": "This restaurant is in front of the Desert Botanical Gardens and features farm to table food.  It is very pricey!  I had lunch with a friend and we ordered the quinoa, which was very good. Small portion, perfect to share. Then I had a french dip sandwich which was served in a soft french roll with some kind of mayonaise horseradish spread and the dip. It was just ok.  I thought the roast beef was a little taste-less, and I didn't realize they were going to put they mayo-horseradish sauce on it as I would have preferred it without. My companion ordered the steak with the peppercorn sauce. That was absolutely delicious!  The steak was excellent!  With each of us having a beverage (no alcohol) the bill came to a whopping $80.000!! This is by the far the most expensive lunch I have had in a long time!  I would definitely recommend the steak and the quinoa dish.    For the price they charge, I was disappointed in the level of service. They have a great chef, but train your servers better.  My companion left a very generous tip, which I thought was way too much. $20 for lunch??? (so the total was $100 for lunch for 2 people)  It is a little bit of a walk from the parking lot, but parking is free and you don't have to enter the botanical garden to eat at the restaurant.  It was 120 when we were there so it wasn't crowded. In nicer weather they also have seating outside.  We had reservations, but didn't need them.",

We shared a trio of appetizers: a sampling of local cheeses and marinated vegetables, a warm dish of plump mussels and squid, and a crispy kale salad. The salad was a big hit, along with the mussels. For entrees we enjoyed Korean chicken, rich duck enchiladas, succulent scallops and a bodacious cheeseburger. All paired nicely with the local Arizona wines. We did manage to find room for dessert, none of which disappointed. The service was attentive as we wanted for nothing. As a chef for the last 30 years I don't know what else I could have asked for.",

Honestly, the food wasn't impressive enough for me to ever come back to again. Server was friendly and recommended the smoked pork gumbo with eggs. I wasn't impressed. It was really bland with a taste of burnt and no where near smoked. Just after taste of burnt stew with no seasoning. Not appetizing at all. I am glad we got the French toast with cactus jam to share so I would actually leave feeling somewhat satisfied.

I wish she would crack a smile and be more professional. I'm not sure she realized the impact she makes with her poor service. For the price of the food, I would expect better service. She treated it as if she's working at a local sports bar. The food was fine so this is quite upsetting. Considering it's valentines weekend, wouldn't you want to put in some effort for big tips??

It's at the entrance of the Botanical Gardens and you do not have to pay admissions to Gardens. Staff is friendly and efficient. The menu is simple gourmet locally delicious and visually tight-good targeted items for brunch and lunch- not a bunch of gooey typically sugary buttery items.  Steak and eggs with fingerling potatoes was perfect- clean and delicious and plated in a modern elegant way. They have a strong cold filtered iced coffee that has a great kick. They also has a bar serving very cool creative cocktails and sitting where family could relax after a morning at the gardens. Indoor and outdoor seating- views of huge cactus surround the restaurant. Worth a stop- you will feel good after this experience.",

The place is packed full of little old ladies (which makes sense since it is in the botanical garden).  The food certainly fits it's clientele though because it could not have been more bland.  My boyfriend got the fish tacos which were tasteless.  For a taco there was not even a hint of spice. The beans were undercooked as well, but they were the only thing on our plates that was hot.  I got the chicken sandwich which really small and a small side of cold chewy fries.  The only thing that I do have to say that I really loved was my strawberry basil lemonade which was perfectly fruity and refreshing and made fresh to order.  It almost made me bump my review up to a 3 star, but that's literally the only thing I liked this spot.  The service was just okay.  With such a unique menu I would love to have a waitress who explained the more unique dishes and made some recommendations.  Our waitress didn't even tell us the soups of the day.  I'm sorry, but for the price you pay for this food you need someone to help you make good choices and even just check in on you to ask how your meal is tasting.  My last thing to note is the price.  Without any alcohol, appetizers, or desserts our meal was over 40 dollars for a bland tiny little lunch.  Unless you want to stop here for a drink after a day in the garden I say SKIP IT.",

    "text": "My co-workers and I recently dined here mid-week during the lunch hour.  The overall ambiance of the restaurant (mind you it's too hot to sit outside) was not that impressive.  The inside dining area seemed sterile and only featured a simple succulent plant on each table...nothing ellaborate or inviting. I imagine that sitting outside in the cooler months makes the ambiance...so don't waste your time going when it's hot, as you may think you are sitting in a cafeteria.   Unfortunately I was expecting to be impressed with the food as well, especially after reading some reviews.  However, the food fell short of any high expectation I had.   I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with the triple cooked fries. Unfortunately, the sandwich itself was incredibly greasy and the fries were almost a chewy consistency.   Others in our party ordered the Niman Ranch Burger (complaint of grease and chewy fries), Steak and Fries (steak was overcooked), Salmon salad (no complaints), Green Chili Pork (o.k.).  I have since been online to the County site and read the not so flattering inspection reports.  It seems they have a few things to work on.  No need for me to go back to Gertrude's...I'm glad I tried it, but once was enough.",

    "text": "Beautiful garden courtyard setting!  Right when we got to the DBG, I went in and scoped the place out.  The hostess informed me that I should make reservations now for lunch (got there at 10am).  Good idea!  We had lots of time to do the butterfly exhibit and walk around the grounds a bit.   They were pretty busy when we got back there around noon, so call in for reservations if you're planning to go.  We preferred to be seated outside to soak up the beautiful cool and sunny weather.  They offered mimosas and bloody Mary...I was soooo tempted.  Next time.  My little cutie pie ordered grilled cheese sandwich with a side of fries and cranberry juice.  When it came out, I knew he would not like it.  Melted American cheese between two slices of white bread is not his thing.  He's used to fontina, havarti or aged white cheddar and whole grain bread.  After long walks, I crave for a good hearty salad...beet salad in this case.  While I love the use of multi colored baby beets, I was disappointed in four round bunny pellet-like goat cheese.  It was spread out on the plate to make it look like a good amount...it was barely peeking out.  \"You could do a little more lettuce, eh?\"  My husband snickered.  I gave him the stink eye.  I also gave his  Mahi mahi tacos a look over.  I should've gotten that.  He said the blandness could've been remedied by a spicy salsa on the side.  Nevermind.  They do cater to an elderly crowd and had just opened and need to work the kinks out.  We're going back for the breakfast menu to try out the mimosas and bloody Marys with that!  And MORE GOAT CHEESE please!!!",

    "text": "I have tried this place twice now and both times the underwhelming service has overshadowed the good food. The overall experience was more ok than a-ok.  Let's start with the high points... Both times I went, my guest and I split the beet salad as an appetizer and it was delicious. The beets and greens were fresh, the goat cheese was delicious and the hazelnuts were perfectly toasted. The presentation was a layer over an oversized square plate. Little touches like the nontraditional presentation just go to show the amount of thought and heart put into the restaurant by the chef and team. For an entree I ordered the Hot Mess (chilaquiles) and my guest ordered the chicken sandwich. Both entrees had amazing flavor that didn't come from just dumping salt as other restaurants may try. Not a single negative about the chicken sandwich. The Hot Mess wasn't too hot...barely above room temperature and the layers of corn tortilla were more stale than anything. Would I order it again though? Yes in hopes that the flaws were a fluke. It was that delicious otherwise.  My second visit was for lunch and this time we got burgers. We had the Niman Ranch and Bleu Niman burgers. Both were cooked perfectly to order and did not disappoint at all. The fries that came alongside were delicious and perfectly seasoned. This time the food was all at the prefect temperature.  Now the service...ugh. Both times I made a reservation on Open Table. Fantastic that Gertrude's offers this! On the first visit (for Sunday brunch) I was told there would be a 20 minute wait when I arrived, so we opted to sit at the bar where there is open seating and we were able to sit immediately. This may have been a mistake. The service was slow and sparse. I don't blame this on poor workers, but on the amount of work that two bartenders had to do to accommodate a bar with easily 12 people sitting there for food and drink service as well as fulfilling the wine/beer/cocktail orders for the restaurant. The bartenders were so busy I almost felt like I was interrupting or disturbing them when I asked for something I needed. On the second visit (for lunch during the week) we were promptly seated with the Open Table reservation. But this time, it took a while to be greeted by our server and for drink orders to be taken. This seemed to be common at the tables around us as well. Service in general was better on the second visit, but still slow and not what one would hope for.  Paying the check wasn't a simple task either time. On the first visit, my card was charged for the wrong check, which was actually cheaper than my check. Of course I spoke up and told the bartender. He apologized and said he had to have his manager adjust the transaction. I didn't realize until a couple days later that the original transaction wasn't actually voided, but their drawer was comped. So my debit card was charged for both transactions. When I called back and spoke to a manager, she was apologetic but seemed to have no urgency in correcting the issue. She told me that it would have to wait until later in the day because I called during their lunch rush and she had to attend  to that. Hmmm...you would think this kind of problem might take a little priority. Regardless, the issue was ultimately resolved. On my second visit, I went prepared with cash. When I asked for the check, the server brought the check for the sixtop that was seated 2 tables over. I'm sensing a theme.  Overall...I'd say Gertrude's is worth a visit, but be prepared for a few hiccups along the way. Hopefully as they get on their feet things will improve.",

Extremely bad abdominal pain and I had to run to the bathroom to throw up. Then I had diarrhea and had to sit in the bathroom for 30 minutes until the pain dulled. Seafood poisoning happens quite immediately and can be dangerous, I also hadn't eaten anything for around 9 hours before dinner so it couldn't have been something previous. While I was in the bathroom sick, my husband went to tell the manager I likely had seafood poisoning from the scallops so they could know to stop serving them. The manager was extremely defensive and said it must be a coincidence. She then told him that if I didnt need an ambulance that I must not be as sick as I say. She then said if they were to believe us that we would need to email her my medical records saying I was tested for food poisoning. All of this happening while I'm sick in the bathroom next to the restaurant. We didnt tell them for money or to be comped, we just didnt want anyone else to get sick. Just a really poor attitude on the manager's part. If you plan to dine here, I just recommend not eating the seafood because you could become very sick like me.",

Since my mother can't hear that well in settings like that, I asked if we could be moved to the corner where there was an empty 3 person table.  Nope, couldn't be done as that table had a reservation.  Ok, that's fair.  But, that table was never occupied the entire time we were there, for an hour.  Strike 1.  Strike 2 was the lunch menu.  Not much to choose from that wasn't $20-$30.  Even a hamburger was $18.  So we had the grain salad, small size and ok in taste, just a bit \"meh\" and soup.  The $10 butternut soup was seasoned nicely, but the quantity was minuscule and the posole in it was pretty crunchy, not chewy.  Strike 2.  So disappointing, since we had gone to Gertrude's specifically after seeing the show on Plate & Pour, and had been intrigued by the cactus mentions.  No cactus to eat on the menu, Strike 3.  We went to the gift shop after that and bought a book for a friend.  First we were asked did we want to add a half-price necklace to that purchase.  When the answer was no, thank you, then we were asked did we want to round up the purchase amount by 89 cents.  You're Out.  So, our overall impression of the place is:  lovely gardens, but the grasping merchandising is off-putting.  If we return, we will skip eating there and instead take visitors to one of the many fine, reasonably priced restaurants in the downtown area.  It's too bad the hard-sell food and merchandising bring this place down.  The upside was the lovely volunteers--very engaging.",

    "text": "On a Saturday morning in which my family and I celebrated my sister's birthday at the Phoenix Zoo, we needed a spot to go for lunch afterwards.  Gertrude's was by far the closest restaurant nearby so off we went.  I've come to the Botanical Gardens a bunch of times, but have never dined here.  Gertrude's is located right near the front entrance of the Botanical Gardens and fortunately doesn't require a Garden admission to get in.  The restaurant is enormous with a bunch of seating both inside and out (I'm guessing at least 200 seats).  Despite it's size, I've seen this place packed particularly at night during Luminaria season.  We were able to get a patio table for 7 pretty quickly for a Noon brunch.  The brunch menu differs a bit from the dinner menu so I can't speak for what the food is like after 4pm.  Brunch options range from the fairly typical all American breakfast options to light lunch options, but with their own twist.  Gertrude's sources a bunch of their stuff locally and makes a point of it to say so.  None of which is that unusual in today's up and coming restaurant scene of course, but its pretty clear the Botanical Garden staff wants to remind you that their on site restaurant takes its cuisine seriously.  I have to say I was pretty impressed with our server Matt.  He was unusually knowledgable about the food on the menu including the cooking methods used and even went out of his way to say what was good and not so great that day.  Almost as if the chef himself was our server for the day.  Matt was particularly enthusiastic about a menu item they call the Breakfast Bowl.  Its a smoked pork gumbo that they put in a bowl on top of a bed of corn muffins and top with eggs any style.  I love me some good gumbo so I went with that option with over medium eggs per Matt's recommendation.  I also got a side order of their fingerling potatoes as Yelpers seemed to rave about those.  To wash it all down I got their seasonal red sangria which uses a variety of fresh seasonal locally grown fruits.  The sangria was a super refreshing start.  Not too sweet with a smooth cold finish.  The fact that it was served in a red wine glass was a bit odd to me, but no complaints about the drink itself.  As for the main event, the gumbo was pretty decent.  The corn muffin and roux used in the gumbo was excellent, as were the bits of sausage they included.  The pork was pretty good too though it might've perhaps been cooked down a little too much as the pork just disintegrated rather than pulled apart.  It didn't hurt the flavor profile too much, but the texture was a little odd.  The fingerling potatoes were seasoned well and the side order was very generous, though perhaps they could add just a tad more olive oil.  All in all though, a solid brunch.  Total cost for the food, drink, tax, and tip came to about $33.  A better than average value in my opinion.  I give Matt some pretty solid marks for helping us with our menu choices as the rest of my family seemed thoroughly enjoy their meal.  And as many have mentioned, its hard to beat the ambience of Gertrude's when the weather it just right.  The view from the patio in particular is work making a reservation for.  So if you're planning on making a trip to Botanical Gardens, or are just in the neighborhood looking for a sit down spot as we were, Gertrude's is a hideaway within a hideaway.  In the middle of a densely populated desert metropolis no less.",

The others ordered the Poke, a scoop of Chicken salad and the Gertie burger. It all came to  $70 plus tip.   The chicken (mine) came with a zesty, creamy aioli and braised Brussels sprouts. There were three crispy, boneless thighs and about six split sprouts. It was very good, having a higher than average spice level, good char on the sprouts and juicy, crispy, perfectly cooked chicken.   The Poke was fresh, with about 10 1\" cubes plus aioli. Too expensive for the value tho.   The burger was well received, with compliments given to the aioli and the bun.   The chicken salad was, well, chicken salad.   Not the best value but there were definitely some well done components.",

It was made with fingerling potatoes. When I make those potatoes they taste horrible but here the chef knows how to cook. Everything was cooked to perfection. The meat was tender and moist. The potatoes were soft and delicious. The tortilla was just a wrap holding all the tasty things inside. It was not too much not too little it was just right. It was breakfast and our waiter told us we could order appetizers. Donut-holes! I think they were actually aebleskivers, but who really knows how to pronounce that for breakfast! They were really good. The came with dipping sauces. Raspberry (my favorite), caramel (Brad's favorite) and chocolate. The first two were quite good. Surprisingly the chocolate was not as good.  Everyone has their own tastes. It was hot and it was only 9:30 in the morning, but you can order beer in Phoenix. Brad tried the bottle of Grand Canyon Brewing. It was a coffee stout (I hope I got that right). Brad said it was smooth and the coffee was perfect. We are looking for this here locally, but nothing has turned up yet. Our server was quite good. I thing his name is Jash? Anyway he was great. His suggestions were right on. I almost forgot. Jash told us about the \"chile\" that comes with the burrito. I told him I liked it HOT, so he recommended a HOT read sauce. Brad likes a milder spice so he suggested the green sauce. WOW! Though it is not Hatch, it was really good. My noise was sniffling after I finished. The mild red we both decided was not to our liking. The portions are HUGE. We had breakfast again the next day. Next time we have a plan. We are going to share a burrito and french toast. That should be good enough for us. Oh and of course we worked up on appetite walking thru the gardens. We will definitely be back.",

Gertrude's is a hidden little gem at the Desert Botanical Gardens.  You can make it your destination or you can pair it with a visit to the DBG.  Either way, you're in for a treat.  We were pleasantly surprised to walk in and hear live musician Lawrence Zubia performing... he was awesome.  We waited at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged as I think we timed our visit during a shift change... We then decided to have a seat at the bar instead of waiting a bit longer for patio seating, which on a beautiful day, is definitely the way to go.  (Next time!)  The bartenders were super friendly and the menu had plenty of unique options... with ingredients sourced from local farms in AZ and around the Southwest.  We started with the cold smoked salmon \"tartare\" to share.  It was delicious; we devoured it!  From there, my husband had the B.L.T.E. and I had the veggie frittata.  I won on that order... the frittata was perfectly cooked, had plenty of flavor from the eggs, veggies and potatoes, and it was served with lightly dressed and parmesan sprinkled greens.  Despite ordering the \"E\" in his sandwich as over easy, they arrived a bit more done.  It was alright... not amazing.  He'd definitely try something different next visit.  I hear that the lemonade at Gertrude's is some of the best in the Valley, so I'll have to try that next time as well... and we'll have to bring the kids too; I was pleased to see a nice looking and decently priced kids menu!  The restaurant is located next to the DBG gift shop and has a short little trail through part of the garden.  I'm not sure if we were supposed to walk that trail without purchasing admission to the garden, but we did, and we enjoyed it.  Can't wait to return!",

We dined here for #restaurantweek and were thoroughly disappointed in the cuisine and service. Our server was cold, impersonal and borderline rude. We decided to try the prefix meal anyways. I myself ordered the black bean soup which was not only off in texture but flavor as well. It was as if it was pureed beans served as is. Odd and left a lingering taste that was not pleasant. My friend ordered the orange scented cauliflower and it was extremely lackluster. Bland and undercooked. For the next course i tried the fried chicken and Brussels sprouts. The chicken was dry and tough which is odd for being a thigh. It left an strange aftertaste that could have made someone cringe. None of the sauces were anything but ordinary and disappointing. My friend had the mushroom bolognese. This was the worst dish of them all. She describes it as sauce being frozen then cooked then frozen then cooked again. We couldn't put our finger on the after taste but it was extremely unpleasant. We both ordered the flourless chocolate tort because hey, everyone loves chocolate and at this point this had to be the best dish. Wrong again. It was very bitter and it lingered. Sad to mess up something so simple. The presentation was beautiful with all of the dishes but the meal fell so short that it is unfortunate for what potentially could be a wonderful place. I left wondering why I chose to come here and disappointed to say the least. As my friend so kindly put it, not even worthy to serve the dog.",

It was little hard to find - it wasn't obvious from the signage that the restaurant was inside the Desert Botanical Garden. It was sunny and I would have liked a little more umbrella coverage so no one in our group had to worry about getting burned.  The food was a little too foo-foo for me. (Disclaimer: I have the palette of a 5 year-old so fancy food does not impress or interest me.) I had the American breakfast - poached eggs (cooked to perfection), sausage (very good), fingerling potatoes, and toast. I asked for an English muffin instead of regular bread and was a little miffed they wouldn't make that substitution. My Dad and the eggs benedict and enjoyed it. Mom had the frittata and said it was a bit oily. Our friend had the mahi tacos and really enjoyed them.   We topped off the meal by splitting the donut holes. They were delicious.   This probably isn't a place I'd seek out again, but I'd be open to returning if someone invited me. I think I'd like to try it at lunch instead of brunch next time.",

Inside is pretty ordinary, but I understand this as they do a big lunch crowd when the weather gets better.  The place was only about a quarter full which is very sad, as I'll bet the boring chain restaurants were busy.  I don't get the values here, people would rather go to the Cheesecake Factory and eat the same manufacured crap they can get in Des Moines or Cleveland, rather than go to an independent place with genuine local food.    The food here really is really very very good.  Some dishes need a tad bit of work, but this is probably the closest to farm to table the area has.  The waiter was much better than the last visit as well.  My only complaint is the menu is hard to read.  The font is small and the print is so light you need a searchlight to read it if you are over 40.  Luckily the waiter gave me a small flashlight,,,  I sure hope this place picks up customers as the weather gets better.  It would be a crime to lose it.",

    "text": "Was disappointed with dinner at Gertrude's today. I had blackened scallops...the accompanying sauces were a rather boring mush except for some celery that added interest (they had been touted as spicy hot).   When we were selecting our meals, the server had also offered to have the scallops prepared  seared and in a \"mild\" fashion a risotto rather than in the Cajun fashion. A companion had been interested in this and asked if drawn butter could be given as well. The server said no to the drawn butter, so my companion selected a burger. In retrospect, I now wish I had selected the soup and salad, the burger (but with fries), or the mildly prepared scallops.  Another companion had monk fish that had some East Indian flavoring, which was delightful. But then I took another bite and had raw monk fish. I thought to myself, this doesn't taste cooked...it's more like sushi/sashimi, which I love, but somehow, this taste doesn't make me want to eat any more of what I had thought was a wonderful dish (just lost my appetite for it with that raw bite). My companion later asked me if I wanted any more, and I said no. I later noticed she wasn't finishing her last bites, and I asked if she had noticed raw areas, and she affirmed it.  I tasted the burger and thought it was good. Accompanying \"kettle-style\" chips were quite black peppery...just okay. I don't think fries were an option. I have seen this burger served with fries in the past...Anyway... Companion was put off by an area of the burger that was medium-rare/rare in the middle (she'd ordered it medium well). I didn't mind that on a burger.   I told the server at the end of the meal about the fish so she could tell the chef. She said I should have told her and she would have had it cooked further or something. Her manner seemed overly defensive. I got the impression she thought I was angling for money off the bill. I wasn't. (We had already received it.) I just wanted her to be able to give feedback to the chef.   I don't know that I will be back to Gertrude's...I think they should be able to cook the fish better. I also just now got grossed out as I realized one reason to cook fish through is possible parasites...Just read monk fish can have round worms. Yuck. Now thinking that I should have spit the raw stuff out. Oh well. I think the Victorians used to swallow tape worms as a dieting measure. Link below says folks can often feel worms in mouth. I don't think I want anymore monk fish. Nope.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yourdoctorsorders.com%2F2014%2F05%2Fparasites-and-seafood%2F&s=ece8864e45390809d2b802591a00005e887f38786fce4a5768aaa4194ba3b119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">yourdoctorsorders.com/20...</a> --reason fish should be cooked thoroughly.   Outdoor table at Gertrude's quite nice. Bread and butter was wonderful... Nicely herbed and toasted.  If I were to return here, I might try soup and salad...dessert....or drinks...after or before going into the garden. I think Gertrude's needs to work on their entree execution. One major thing they have going for them is their location....I would not go here just for the restaurant.",

    "text": "My family and I had a very nice lunch at Gertrude's. We sat outside and the staff was very accommodating in setting up an umbrella just right to shade out table.  I ordered the cheeseburger, done medium well. It was cooked just perfectly - done but not overdone. It was still juicy and flavorful. I loved the dressing that was on it and the bun was fresh. The fries were also very tasty. Some have said the portions are small but that was not the case with the burger. I couldn't finish it and believe me I like to eat.  My mom got the chicken sandwich which comes with cole slaw on the burger, which I thought was unusual. But she said the chicken was cooked well and was flavorful.  Our server was very nice and attentive. My only complaint (and why I docked a star) was the hostess. There was a wait so I gave her my name. She told me it would be about 15-20 minutes and then asked for my phone number. I asked her if she would text me and she said yes. 25 minutes passed and no text. We were sitting just outside the door so I went in and she said she was waiting for me. I told her I thought she was going to text me. She said only if she could get us in early. I've NEVER had to check back at a restaurant. They always come get you! Especially since we were sitting right there! So I thought that was weird and disappointing that we sat there for more time than we needed to. I guess if I hadn't checked we'd have been sitting even longer! They need a new system. Like maybe the system that every other restaurant on the planet uses.  Anyway, I would go back because I liked the food but now I know to be wary of the hostess.",

I had the bloody mary mussels and I honestly could have poured the sauce into a cup to drink every last drop it was so good! Other highlights from our party's order included the BEAUTIFUL beet salad and the short ribs which my dad devoured.   The 5th star here goes to service. Our baby was a bit fussy and one of the servers (not ours) came up and said that she would be happy to walk our baby around and entertain her with the toys in the (fabulous!) gift shop while we enjoyed our meal. She said that when she was a young mom a server at a restaurant offered to do the same thing for her so she was paying it forward. So, yes, we basically received free babysitting at this lovely restaurant. Our server was very attentive too, and I want to give him a special shout out for accommodating our martini with blue cheese olive request - since they didn't have pre-made blue cheese olives he used a pastry bag to fill olives with blue cheese himself. My kind of guy!",

It doesn't quite make sense right? Well, opposites attract in this case because this swine is divine. The Chef smokes this swine to perfection and each bite is better than the last. I would have never thought walking into Gertrude's that I would be writing this review, but it's True. Get the swine.  Ok, I will go a little deeper into this review and digress about the restaurant itself and not just the swine. The patio is adorable and has a nice fountain and garden feel to it. It is the Desert Botanical Garden after all. This is a great restaurant addition to the garden and a perfect spot to dine for lunch or dinner during your visit. However, I think it should be a destination even if you aren't going to the garden, because the swine is that good. The Chef is just incredibly talented with all his food. Who would have thought! The Desert Botanical Gardens! A culinary haven!",

The restaurant was clean and the decor was pretty. My only complaint is that the menu needs more options of more simple items. I'm not sure what a child would eat if a family went there, because of very strange selections. But if you like over complicated menus with ingredients you've never heard of and dishes that sound less than appetizing then definitely check this place out.",

    "text": "Can't recommend it.  Some friends and myself ate there on 2/22/14.  We had reservations for 6pm and it was SUPER crowded, (because of the Chihuly installation), so I would say make a reservation if you'd like to dine here. They did get us to a table outside quickly, but they were so busy, it was a bit before we met our waiter. He introduced himself, told us he'd be back, and took off (could you at least offer us water?). He came back, took our drink orders, didn't ask if we were ready to order (we were), and took off. He came back took our orders and took off. Here come the drinks, which we nursed for about 50 mins. before caving in and ordering a second round. At this point, we just gave up conversing and started staring at the other patrons.  The food arrived a little after an hour we ordered it.  It was good, but nothing to rave about.  We got the lamb dish and that was tasty, but for entree, it needed about 25% more on the plate. We had the Cornmeal Calamari appetizer, also pretty tasty. I had the Niman Ranch Burger. My impression was it was cooked well (medium rare), but I've had a better burger at the People Pizza Pub downtown. The fries were plentiful and warmish (blech). I ate some because this entree was $15.00. FIFTEEN DOLLAR cold, vanilla, french fries. After that, we played \"Who Can Get the Server's Attention First?\" and pretty much had to throw our credit card at him, for him to come to our table and bill us out. No dessert offered (they have it).  My suggestions would be, get water on the table (we'll let you know if we don't want it, but it is Arizona).  Don't make people wait over an hour and then pay full price for their food or alternatively, throw us a round of drinks to keep us happy. Honestly, I think we were just lost in the crowd. So, I'm not highly offended at this place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again.  The Highlights:  Sit outside at night if you can, desert scenery is beautiful Seated immediately Server was pleasant and gamely put up with our many dietary requests (We had several gluten free/dairy free eaters with us.) Server was fairly knowledgeable.  Food was good. Not great. Service was slow, but I'll say that was because of how busy they were.  We waited over an hour for our food.  Over, overpriced for what they serve. Our bill was $190.00 -4 people, 4 drinks, 1 bottle of wine, 2 appetizers, 4 entrees. (At least that's what I think, but you be the judge.)  *Update: Points given to Chantal for getting back to me. That alone will make me come back.",

It was just about 9:15am when we arrived, asked for a table for 8, and got a little push back from the hostess (who actually may have been the supervisor, I think) well when we requested our table for 8, she said she wasn't sure if she could get us one and that we should of called the day before to request a table that size and so that they could be ready for us. Well that's offputting - maybe I would of understood more if it was a packed house at the time, but it sure as hell was not! There was one other family of 4 and a table for 2 out on the patio, that's it! There was plenty of room for us and for them to out together 2 tables!..  Ok breathe Dianne...anyway food was ok everyone seemed happy with their meals. But mine was underwhelming. I had the Breakfast Bowl, which was to be pork gumbo with eggs and a corn muffin. It was more just refried beans, a lifeless egg and a corn muffin just thrown all up in the beans. I guess I expected a bit more of a presentation.    All in all - loved the Desert Botanical Garden, just next time, I'll eat before I get there",

Why would you have a Cajun menu at a Botanical Garden featuring Arizona Desert plants? The pricing was a bit high for what you get, but in all honesty, it wasn't bad, and it is at the Botanical gardens.  The smoked chicken salad sandwich was better than your average chicken salad, and the salad I got to accompany it was delicious! I would not write home about the smoked salmon and caviar!",

    "text": "Elegant and relaxing spot with a conceptually great menu that does not deliver on execution and flavor.   My french toast was dryyy as a bug fart. The bread was not a moist enough variety to begin with and was far too dense, it seemed to have soaked up very little liquid prior to being grilled. The lack of sauce was just silly, it's served with prickly pear syrup and creme fraiche that was one skimpy line each, the ratio to the amount of bread made no sense to me. I can understand if the chef doesn't want the plate drenched in sauces, but there was no balance there at all, and that dry, dense bread actually needed the drenching. At the very least, more syrup needs to be offered as an option when the food was delivered, and the bread should be switched to something fluffier that can get that buttery-sear-with-squishy-innards that french toast has to have to be good.  Our server Max was very very nice, but the service was irritatingly slow regardless, and not just from him, I could see another table trying to flag their server too. We were there before the Sunday rush and I get the feeling that the servers had too much side work and couldn't keep their focus on the tables? Just a guess there, but in any case it took way too long to get a check, and way too long for it to be run. I appreciate that the place is designed for loitering and that it's hard to find that balance between hovering and absenteeism, but they really need to work on it in my opinion.  I'll be back to give the lunch a shot, or to just grab a drink and read a while when time is not at all on my mind, but I really wouldn't recommend Gertrude's to anyone at this point, better to go The Farm or somewhere in Old Town and then mosey over to the Botanical Garden after. But I know they're really trying to make Gertrude's a great place and I'll be rooting for them. I'm guessing they face some specific challenges due to the location and hope they can find their groove.",

The concept is farm to table, and the items on the menu seemed to follow that trend.  We both wanted to eat light that day, so both got the fish tacos (\"locally sourced\" Mahi Mahi??).  The flavors were good, but the execution could have been better (one example being the dry/burnt corn tortillas).  And the meal was definitely light--large appetizer portion.  Not all their meals were like that--the Sonoran Dog (with fries) looked fantastic and could feed two people, easily.  I'd recommend having an extended discussion with the waiter on what you want before you order.  The ambience was superlative.  We ended up inside, due to the crowds, but the views were fantastic out of large windows.  Just a great space and experience overall.",

We also had a very friendly waiter, which always makes for a more pleasant experience.  We started with an appetizer of Bloody Mary Mussels. They were pretty good and they give you an order of fries with it to sop up the sauce.   I ordered the chicken sandwich, which was pretty good. My stepdad got the Mahi Mahi tacos, which looked excellent. My mom had risotto, which I tasted and thought was really good but she didn't love it that much and kept adding seasonings to it to make it more to her liking. Our friend ordered the whole grain salad and seemed to enjoy it.   We opted to try two desserts to share. The donuts and sauces and the brown butter apple tart, which had a side of caramel ice cream. I'm not big on either of these desserts normally but the donut was really good and the caramel ice cream was delicious too. I really disliked the apple tart though ( i was alone in that---the rest of the table devoured it but I couldn't take more than 1 bite).",

The food has good flavor, but the price is way too much for what you get. Ex: my husband got a burger and it was huge and came with fries...so plenty of food. I got the pasta special and it was supposed to be chicken bolongnese and there was NO chicken in it. Only little bits, and for $15 I think it would be good to have a few pieces of chicken.  It was a bit too small as well (and I don't eat much).  3. The plates especially for the desserts are super big and the desserts are small so it really looks like you don't get much for $10. It is fine to have a small dessert but it's about the impression of it.   4. The atmosphere is great as well. Love the menu- great ideas, creativity and potential. It's not France though, so for some menu items maybe give a bit more food (or protein).",

(it's been over a week by the way, and no one's called me back.)   but since we were going to the botanical gardens anyway, we figured we'd pop in and ask about the menu. the host was very kind and full of all the right answers. apparently the owner(s) child(ren) have celiac and/or wheat allergy and the kitchen is designed to be safe for people with celiac and wheat allergy, even though they also serve gluten. we decided to sit down and have a meal there. the server was equally amazing, and very good about reassuring me that the chefs take great care to prepare glutenfree food for those who need it.  the vegan options are sorely lacking-- my partner and i split the hummus plate and quinoa tabouleh (our only two options), and both were delicious. the tabouleh had onions (sadface) and was a very small portion on a very large plate, but the hummus plate was enormous and delicious. (the blanched curry cauliflower was a fantastic touch!) i'm really glad we stopped in to eat there.  they were so freaking careful with our food, that the most stressful part of the meal had nothing to do with the restaurant or servers at all-- it was that my parents were incapable of getting through a meal without ordering a giant hunk of bread, and i was really really worried that they'd be spitting or blowing crumbs onto my food. (the bread, by the way, smelled so delicious, i almost cried. but again, not the restaurant's fault.)  i look forward to eating here during las noches de las luminarias, too. if you're reading this, Gertrude's, please consider making a gf vegan soup and keeping the hummus plate on the menu for awhile. :)",

    "text": "We spent some time around the botanical gardens and decided to end the visit with some wine and an app. Of course this place was the most convenient so we checked it out.  The servers are pleasant and the atmosphere is a bit upscale but overall the place is pretty cool.  We had a couple glasses of wine with the hummus app. I would say the only downfall was that the veggies they served it with were pickled...the elements on their own were delicious but together it was a bit weird. In my mind, when you have such awesome hummus, you want  to taste that not pickled stuff.  Anyway, if we ever go back to the gardens we will go here again because the other items on the menu looked great.",

Instead I ordered the  specials; cold fresh green pea soup and mushroom risotto or was it asparagus risotto? It was not memorable. It's something I make at home pretty often and mine, as untrained as I am, is better. The pea soup was bland and chalky.  My tablemate said that her fish tacos were the best she ever had.  Since it's summer, I won't even think about going back to Gertrude's for at least six months. And then I'll think again.",

The location is excellent, since I go to the botanical gardens a lot.  A LOT.  And I work a mile away from there, so when I feel like getting out of the office, I go there.  Yes, it's a bit pricey, but I don't mind that so much (even though I have suggested that they need to do discounts in the summer, when the gardens are completely dead).  I do mind that this restaurant is definitely crafted for non-family groups.  It just doesn't feel comfortable to go there after walking around the garden, sweaty, with little kids.  I get dirty looks from other people.    And the botanical gardens are a family place...so why isn't the restaurant?",

    "text": "Gertrude's is in a lovely location, situated right at the entrance to the Desert Botanical Garden.  My wife and I attended the Luminarias event and figured on a light dinner to kick things off.  The restaurant itself is well laid out, and although loud when full the noise is not overwhelming; some attention has obviously been paid to the acoustics.  It's a pleasant place to eat, but the food was disappointing.  The menu is creative, but none of the entrees were immediately appealing, so we went with appetizers and sides that looked tastier.  My wife had the gumbo and a side of broccoli and cheese, I had the dirty chips (potato chips with a blue cheese fondue and chicken livers) and green salad.  The gumbo was tasty and well-spiced on its own, at least at first, but the decision to serve it over horseradish potato salad rather than a more traditional rice base didn't really work for our tastes, and as she ate it she found it increasingly salty to the point where she couldn't finish it.  The chips were tasty at first, but also over-salted; by the time I was halfway through them I couldn't taste anything but salt.  We don't eat out much, so we considered that perhaps our palates were unused to restaurant-level saltiness, but I cook with a fair amount of salt at home so I don't think that's it.    On the bar front, the blackberry/mint seltzer was delicious, and the beer selection small but well-chosen.  The cocktails also looked tasty as they came out, but we didn't order any so can't vouch for them.  The service was very polite and the food came out very quickly, although I think the staff was a bit overwhelmed by the Luminarias crowd.    I think it would be a very nice place to go have a drink or two after a stroll through the Garden, but I wouldn't come back to eat.",

My husband's meat was raw. The kids had Mac and cheese which also had no flavor. I will say that the fingerling potatoes were delicious. It is a shame because they have heavy traffic - which I attribute to the botanical garden and the wonderful electric desert show. The prices are average but really not worth it.",

The staff were all very helpful, and Max, out waiter, was really a delight and took great care of us. The menu is not too long but very extensive, with a focus on local and organic ingredients. We split an Arugula and Date salad - Max wasn't kidding when he described the salads as 'pretty big.' The arugula was a bit peppery which was nice with the dates and candied pecans. My husband had the braised beef and I had the Korean Fried Chicken Thighs. The beef was perfectly cooked and so tender you could cut it with a spoon. My chicken, which came on a bed of roasted Brussels sprouts, was smothered in BBQ sauce and so crispy I initially thought the thighs weren't boneless. But it was just crunchy yummy skins. the sauce was a bit spicier than I expected, but paired with the Brussels sprouts it was really unique and delicious. Even though the entrees were also pretty big, we split the Tres Leches desert which fortunately wasn't huge. Just a sweet end to the meal.  We're new to Phoenix and agreed that we'd just started a new tradition - a unique meal before a beautiful event in the desert. We'll ask to sit in Max's section if he's still there, but if the rest of the staff is half as sincere, helpful and friendly as Max, we'll still have an excellent and memorable evening.",

Took bartender Jonathan's recommendation to try the \"Sweet Beets Cheesecake\" made with Goat cheesecake. Perfect. SO much better than standard cheesecake fare. I ate at the bar and Jonathan took great care of me. This was a \"total experience\".

I ordered their salmon salad, which I thought was an intriguing dish because it combined salmon with pork chicharon as it's key ingredients - what a surprise - the subtle fish taste of salmon neutralized with the salt crispness of pork fat, an amalgam of bursting flavors! The hospitality of the food servers was definitely an added plus",

I raved about it to my family and insisted we go while attending Luminarious.  What a mistake,   I had cold brisket, my nephew ate less than half of his braised pork shank and when I asked about it, his description was tough, cold and poorly prepared. His wife has had an upset stomach since we got home.  She had the black pepper spaghetti because she loves peppers, and it was also cold.  Unfortunately, the best meals were my great niece's hamburger and my great nephew's mac and cheese. We could have gone to a high end burger place and spent far less than $200.00   There are too many wonderful restaurants between DBG and my house, so that was my last Gertrude's visit.    Oh, and by the way, I nicely told the manager about our cold food and he did not even offer to comp a dessert.  He did offer to send it back, but it was getting late and we all opted out.",

The menu is fairly diverse..I was even able to feed my vegan grandkids there last week. For the meat eaters the flat iron steak is good and the fresh fish was delicious..think it was branzino....oh so good! And don't leave without trying the Elote..Youll never want boiled corn again. Even the bread is awesome..good and grainy and purchased from a local bakery. The best perk of this restaurant ( aside from great food and a lovely patio) is Master Mixologist, Roberto!!! He has created some incredible cocktails that will make you come back..just for the cocktails. My very favorite is the Lavender lemon drop which is the best drink I've ever had. I love lavender and have tried any cocktail in town that includes lavender. None of the other lavender drinks that I've had in multiple restaurants can touch this cocktail. It's truly delicious. If nothing else..it's worth the trip for this little sip of heaven. I may have to stop in tonight!",

    "text": "I really want to rate Gertrude's more than 3 stars, but it wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be due to the costs and location. It does have a nice outdoor patio within the Desert Botanical Gardens, with heat lamps if needed. The servers are also friendly, but like to try and pull each plate away pretty quickly, which can make for some awkward moments. I get why, but it just seems unnecessary when the restaurant isn't packed. I ordered the \"Gertrude's Greens\" which sounded incredible, but lacked in appearance, ingredients, and flavor. It was supposed to have black kale in it, but I didn't see any at all. It was also supposed to have a Honey Lavender Vinaigrette, which I was hoping was going to be bursting with flavor. However, it did nothing of the sort. I'd like to try and make my own and see if I can't inspire more flavor. Good idea though! I also had the fish tacos, which were good, but kind of bland. I had to douse them in Tapatio to add some additional flavor. Although, I will happily mention that I could tell the fish was of good quality and the beans were really good! I was hoping it was just my food choices, but my Mom and others we were with said they had similar experiences with their dishes.  I of all people understand that healthy/good quality food doesn't need to be overly seasoned. However, it can be a little seasoned. If not that, it can be accompanied with dipping sauces or salsas. I make lots of super healthy food for myself at home and don't always feel the need to season it, but when I go out and spend decent money on food I expect it to to have flavor. Just a thought! Overall, it's worth coming here for a nice healthy bite when visiting the Gardens. The cocktails looked delicious, as well as the wine and beer options. If I came again, I would probably stick to a drink and an appetizer!  Ps - cute furry friends can be seen when dining outside. Definitely a nice addition!",

    "text": "Many times I preface my comments with a disclaimer that many gastronomes carve out negative reviews when they are dissatisfied in a fit of retribution, and those pleased won't spend the energy writing much, thus making many reviews somewhat slanted! I try to be even-handed, not holding back the negative, but try underscoring the positive - always my 'opinion' and those with me at the time.  Gertrude's falls into a peculiar category in my reviewing.  A restaurant that has achieved a well above average category in both foodie social media and professional critics alike place the demands of staff, management and chef to be on the ball all the time, and strive for the consistency that is appropriate to its accolades whether a main dish, soup, salad or sandwich.  That did not happen during our visit recently.  Gertrude's seems to strike me as an eatery that is trying to be a fine dining experience, without the dining experience!  Despite a reputation that under Chef Eldridge back in 2013 offered Gertrude a 3.5 of 5 on Howard Seftel's list - leaving aside his mention of and my agreeing with his \"you-got-to-be-kidding\" comment on his 'bread' issue, I agree across the board.  When you consider Yelp's 3.5 of 5, Open Table's 4 of 5, Zomato's 3.8 of 5 and Robrt Pela's tribute to new Chef Matt Taylor, we could not agree with such praises.  Upon arriving, you almost immediately are overwhelmed by the 'welcome tourist' mentality.  This is not an eatery you approach for both consistency or fine cuisine.  Ratings seem to boast extraordinary fare but they do not appear to pride themselves in giving the customer the best possible food experience, you just get the impression that the diner is there to be stiffed with exorbitant prices, for highly boasted dishes that are on par with much lower grade dining establishments - of which we have plenty in the Valley of the Sun.  This was a meal that was in no way worth bragging about for its value, originality, excellent taste, presentation or the overall dining experience.  As for the prices - you positively do not get what you pay for! Our experience with our high expectations for their Farmer's Soup was far too much cream with extraordinary blandness (salt and pepper please); the French Dip's beef was relatively tasteless, far from being tender with an undecipherable aioli and the au jus dip incredibly frail; and the Chicken Sandwich was nothing to write home about - my wife did not finish it!  Our recommendation - have a drink or two, maybe an appetizer.  If you're in a rush, they'll help you leave quickly - if you're not in a hurry, there's the Gift Shop, they won't rush you out of there! Bon appetit is not the word for Gertrude's!  Happy dining, el Gastro Eclectico!",

At least three tables were seated after us and served before we were.  When our food arrived the two burgers were cold.  One in our party sent it back to be heated.  My scallops were delicious, but the corn under them was cold.  Could it be that our food sat for a while?  The guy that came by the table asked if all was well and took the burger to be heated.  When Lisa found out we sent it back, she couldn't believe \"them\".  The gumbo was good, the grits were \"different\".  My salad was dry, never saw bread.

I ordered the escarole salad with maple dressing, pomegranate seeds, candied pecans and goat cheese. Unfortunately the dressing made the lettuce look brown like old lettuce. Presentation boring. A couple of tiny pecan pieces and a few very small crumbles of goat cheese. Chicken or a LOT more cheese would have been a nice addition. This came with no bread so we ordered a \"bread coarse\". The toasted bread was black on some pieces and the non-toasted bread was rather dry. For dessert we shared a brownie with cranberry ancho sauce. Presentation was nice. It came with a \"scoop\" of vanilla bean gelato that was tablespoon size. The Cranberry ancho sauce was very tasty and while the brownies tasted good they were really hard. Difficult to cut through with a knife. Go for the ambience but don't expect much from the food.",

The strange relish spread the not so fresh bun was not appreciated.  The what we ordered as an over easy egg was cold and the bacon was cold as well.  Tomato was not special.  Just a large one sliced.  Not hot house or special.  Butter lettuce?  The whole thing was dry and not special.    The French toast was also dry and not special.  Seemed like banana bread, which was nice but the prickly pear or agave syrup was too sweet.    The agave or cactus syrup seemed just used in too many foods and drinks.  Overdone.  We didn't try dessert because we thought it, too was probably prepped and not special.  Service was fine.  Everyone was friendly.  It seems like they like to feature AZ desert items but it is just overdone.  We grew up here so it just doesn't seem necessary for us to have incorporated desert items in almost every dish/drink.  Seems like it's made to impress out of towners.",

    "text": "For some reason, because we were at the Desert Botanical Gardens, I thought that Gertrudes would have a large assortment of tasty salads. It makes sense right? Gardens bring to mind fresh produce, spice, herbs, and other food varieties of the veggie kind.  Well thankfully, the Chihuly exhibit exploration led our group to curiously give this restaurant a try, which brought me face to face with the blue ranch burger. It was love at first sight I tell you. The hunk of high quality well cooked beef, caramelized onions, bacon, freshly sliced tomato, and I think there was some lettuce in there, all tasted wonderfully together. I was so surprised! Even the fries were really good. The fries were thick cut, and you could tell that they were deep fried most likely in special oil because they were full of flavor and took on some of that color, but when you picked up each fry, is was light and perfect in texture, not soggy or oily at all. It was highly deceiving, but relieving eating each fry.   The calamari rings were lightly breaded and fried along with complimentary vegetables some of which included onions and peppers. It came with a cream sauce, which I think was an aioli sauce that disappeared very quickly because we enjoyed it so thoroughly between the four of us.   Our waiter had enticed most of our party into ordering the marinated grilled chicken sandwich. It uniquely had jicama in it, but it also had the now traditional fare of guacamole in it. This is what made ordering a very tough decision for me, but even though our waiter's favorite dish is the chicken sandwich, I'm partial to my blue cheese burger!  Oh and food for thought, no pun intended, we chose to sit outside. Even though it was evening and a bit brisk and chilly outside, it was more peaceful and beautiful outside with the surrounding desert plants and trees. There were plenty of outdoor heaters to keep us comfortable so keep that in mind when you choose seating. It was a bit too noisy indoors and crowded, so it was nice to have the option to enjoy outside during the winter.",

The server did not know wines or have the ability to describe the menu changes, he didn't even seem interested to be there.   The plate presentation was not great, as in the past.   My latest review is 3 stars and we will cancel our next reservation we have in a few weeks, will eat elsewhere before arriving at DBG.   Will try again in a few months, but not have the previous high expectations.  We support our DBG and we really want Gertrude's to be part of that experience!",

Also doesn't help that we're headed to the Noches de las Luminarias and will lose time in the garden. Then the waiter decided to tell us the \"truth\" about losing our order.

After looking around their website, looking at the menu and drink offerings, decided to give it a try.  The wine selection was quite impressive, and the cocktails...well lets just say my wife was very happy with her peach cobbler! The appetizer of the poached shrimp was perfect for the two of us, flavors were perfect and was a great start to the meal.  I ordered the wild boar in the green chili, and my wife had the soup of the day (cold strawberry and coconut) and a salad that was special for that day.  I really enjoyed the boar, and the beans that came with the meal were spectacular, I also had the waiter pair a nice glass of wine for my meal and it was a perfect pairing.  My wife's soup is hard to put into words how delicious it was, and lets not get started on the salad!! And to top off a wonderful meal, that we will be telling all of friends and enemies about, we got the doughnuts with the three sauce dessert.  Imaging the best churro you could possibly have, and you might be close.  So in closing, a milestone celebration that was made even better by a perfect evening......",

    "text": "First of all, this is one of the loveliest settings for a Sunday brunch you could ever hope for.  Some of the tables on the patio in the early morning are shaded by well manicured acacia (?) bushes, birds twittering, the desert surroundings beautiful. What better place to sit and dine than in the Botanical Gardens.  We made reservations on Open Table, timing it for just as they opened.  Seating was not a problem. The weather was finally mild not scorching.  Starting with drinks, Mr. B ordered the red Sangria. It came with foam on top, orange and apple slices floating in a wine concoction hinting of peach liquor. Good.  My coffee was not so great. I wished I had gone with iced tea like I saw at other tables. At least they kept my cup filled.  We started by sharing a beet and hazelnut salad.  $12. This was the one dish I would return for. A large plateful of delicious mixed greens that was artfully decorated with three colors of beets, and copious amounts of toasted hazelnuts. Lightly dressed with a sweet dressing, it was a very nice start. My only complaint was an occasional overly salted leaf, a surprise to my tastebuds. It would have been fine with no salt whatsoever.   We chose two entrees at $12 each. The hostess had highly recommended the Hot Mess, which actually is a stack of three crispy corn tortillas, layered with a pork chile verde sauce, topped with some cotija cheese and two sunny side up eggs. While beautiful to look at, the verde sauce tasted bitter and ruined it for me. I ate the eggs (which were beautifully done) and half the tortilla stack, scraped off the meat (too spicy) and sauce, then gave up.   Mr. B liked it better than me and finished most of it...because he didn't like his own dish.  The second entree was the Arizona Benedict. This features a chorizo on English muffin, some cooked greens, cheese, and poached eggs covered in a southwestern seasoned hollandaise sauce.  The two eggs were overcooked to the point of being hard boiled. The chorizo was bitter and the portion diminutive, and the greens, while tasty, could not save the dish. It was not something either of us would order again.  The fingerling potatoes that came with his benedict were prepared by frying then smashing and salting. While attractive to look at, they were lacking any flavor to write home about.  The menu is quite limited and changes with the seasons.  They like to feature local foods and produce.  After having read about the brussel sprout dish, and also the swine, we were both disappointed that neither were on this current summer menu. I strongly suggest you call to find out what is on their seasonal menu first, then decide to come, or not. After all is said, I think that having an American bacon and eggs meal would have suited me better.  Not impressed.",

Cons - Limited menu choices. Service - might have been the worst waiter I've had in years. Unfriendly, inattentive, unhelpful, and slow. Certainly not what you'd expect from a restaurant priced at $35+ per person. (Fortunately another waiter recognized our displeasure and chipped in.)   Final comments - Would give Gertrude's another shot for brunch simply due to the ambience and views (assuming of course I was not assigned the same waiter.)",

I had rice in my dish and every bite had dried bits in it. Nothing was properly salted and if you asked for salt the shaker had coarse salt that hardly let any bits fall from it. I had to put my hand underneath it and shake about 2 hundred times to see if salt was actually falling out. as I said before the wait staff is very nice and the atmosphere is very pleasant but the food is definitely not worth the price you're paying for it.",

    "text": "Had lunch there yesterday, our first visit.  Everything about it was spectacular, ambience, food and service.  Great selection of vegetarian dishes.  Everything was carefully prepared and artfully presented; it's rare that the dish itself exceeds the menu descriptions.  We had the bread service (wonderfully crusty, they said the name of the bakery but can't remember).  \"Sweet tea butter with black Hawaiian sea sale.\"  Sounds pedestrian, tasted wonderful.  The dish called \"Grilled Baby Carrots\" is listed under salads, but is not like any salad ever.  Again, the menu just says \"cumin-scented yoghurt + chemoula + fried AZ chickpeas\" which doesn't even come close to describing the explosive flavors.  For dessert we shared \"Donuts + Sauces.\"  Order it.  Trust me.  The host station folks were welcoming and charming, our server Matthew was terrific and so engaging, and even GM Michelle Jacob stopped by (a couple of times!) to see how we were doing.  Wonderfully creative craft cocktail menu.  I know this must sound like I own shares in the place, the truth is we're not even from Phoenix and just drove out to DBS to get into the countryside.  Didn't know anything about the restaurant, didn't plan to eat there.  We saw hummingbirds, lizards, and other critters.  We will definitely be back and recommend it to all our friends.  Note to chefs in our destination-restaurant hometown of Seattle:  Not everything has to contain bacon or offal.",

What an AMAZING surprise!  First of all, we had no clue that the botanical gardens even existed.  So cool, and right now they have a lit up glass art exhibit going on throughout the park called Chulily.  Really cool!  Our breakfast was delicious and super healthy.  I highly recommend the \"Garden Fritatta\".  The kids had the traditional \"American Breakfast\" and they loved it.  Best fingerling potatoes!  Our server, Mary, was so kind and caring and knowledgable.  You MUST try their housemade strawberry jam......holy cow that stuff is heavenly!  We had the pleasure of meeting the chef, Steven, who was so kind to give us a sample of their again, housemade donuts with 3 different dipping sauces......chocolate fudge, tequila lime custard and the richest caramel.  Sooooo yummy! Didn't catch the tall guy's name who was the manager I believe, but he was wonderful as well!  Thank you for making our everyday Saturday breakfast a surpisingly awesome experience.  We will definitely be back soon!",

Even though it was not very busy and there were lots of empty tables, they \"ran out \" of glasses and we got water in plastic cups. Every time we needed refills we had to ask. We had to waive staff down anytime we needed something. The food came out quickly but cold. It seemed they had made a bunch and then weren't as busy as expected so it just sat until someone ordered it. Everything needed seasoning too. All around disappointment for an over priced mother's day brunch.",

The server was friendly enough, but the food was rather slow to come out and it wasn't even a full house. The menu was trying to be inventive and clever, but the dishes fell short. My group ordered the king salmon, which was tiny for $23; the tacos, which lacked zing; the banana French toast, which was just a few pieces of banana bread with strawberry compote across the top; and the hot mess, which was oddly spiced and just not all the exciting. The best food item we had was the doughnuts with the three kinds of dipping sauce. If you have no choice, it's fine, but if you do, go elsewhere for less.",

    "text": "I regrettably have to say that Gertrude's was underwhelming.  My boyfriend and I were at the Botanical Gardens for a Saturday wine-tasting event and decided to eat here beforehand.  The service was good, and the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  I'd read an article that talked about their Sonoran Dog (a fancy hotdog) and said it was something that you had to eat when in Phoenix.  I disagree.  I was expecting the best hot dog ever, and what I got was something that mostly tasted like the thick bun.  There's so much stuff on it, that the toppings fall off when you try to take a bite, and then the bun is so thick that it overpowers the meat.  When I took a bite of just the dog, it was delicious.  So, I guess I wish that they had a more toned down dog on the menu or that they rethought the bun.  We also ordered the mac and cheese  because I'd overhead someone at the bar remark that it was some of the best that he'd ever had...but I'm not entirely sure that it wasn't the bartender who made that remark.  It was basic mac and cheese with breadcrumbs, and it tasted pretty basic.  There was nothing special about it.  And it was an appetizer portion for $9.  That was the other thing I didn't love about this place--the cost.  We paid $30 before tip for a hot dog, a mac and cheese appetizer, and 2 non-alcoholic drinks.  If the food was better, I would be happy with that price, but, in this case, not so much.  Would I go back if someone else was paying for it?  Sure.  But, on my own dime, next time I'll try to eat before I head to the Gardens.",

As someone from the Boston area, I was completely awe-struck by the scenery (and warm weather) once I stepped out of the car. Cacti, cacti, and more cacti. I ordered the watermelon green tea and indulged in the many appetizers that were sprawled across our table. The bread was so tasty and the sweet tea butter added a perfect twist. Then, we ordered the AZ Tepary Bean Hummus and the Cheese + Charcuterie. The chips were so light and really complemented the hummus. All of the cheeses simply disappeared off the plate once they were put in front of us. I ordered Gertrude's Burger because the Devilled Egg Mayonnaise caught my attention. The portion of the burger was great. All of the toppings flowed together to create one of the tastiest burgers I've ever eaten, especially with seasoned fresh-cut fries on the side! We were a rather large group and I must say that the service was very quick with refilling our drinks and bringing out the food. This place has the best of both words, I would recommend it to anyone visiting Phoenix that wants a True botanical garden experience.",

Instead, we were crammed into what appears to have been a recently converted pantry or walk-in cooler, with a view of the employee's hand washing station; understandable if we just walked in, but we reserved a table weeks in advance.  The look of horror on our face made the hostess take notice, but her proclamation that this was her \"favorite table in the house\" felt prepared, and very insincere.  Valentine's Day Special was $284.00 (automatic gratuity included) for cold Lobster Bisque, cold Chateaubriand, cold Crepe Suzette, and a bottle of Chainier Rose Brut.  Our server, Max, was fantastic.  He kept our glasses full, and did everything he could to make the situation better.",

We have been going to this place since they opened and had previously loved everything about it.   The 'offerings' are fewer and not so appetizing. Truly expensive for what we received.  Very strange ingredients paired together.  My husbands Tuna Sandwich left much to be desired...a pile of tuna with 2 olives on it...the toast it was served on was like a large piece of rubber.  My Hummus wrap had so many grains/seeds in it I thought it was bird food to say the least. The edges of my spinach wrap was hardened all the way around.  All of the previous wonderful pictures and comments on Yelp from other customers are no longer applicable. TOTALLY NEW MENU!  I will say :  THE FRENCH FRIES WERE FANTASTIC!",

The tree lights and the Chihuly sculptures enhanced the experience. OK... the food, exceptional.  Fresh ingredients (no freezer, no microwave). Wonderful bison carpaccio, whole grain salad, risotto and lambcetta that melted in your mouth.  The bar specializes in gin and there were some signature gin drinks that were creative and tasty.  The bar was a bit slow, but we didn't mind the wait. The servers were knowledgeable, attentive and respected some of our dietary restrictions and went out of their way to make sure the food was safe for my wife.   At the end, the executive chef and the owner paid us a visit and listened carefully to our comments on the experience.  I predict a great future for this dining room.  The chef has a lot of tasty ideas up his sleeve.  Go out of your way and pay them a visit.

Very tasty but perhaps a tad over cooked IMO. My friend had the risotto and said while good was not really filling. We had a round of desserts and coffee afterwards. The Red Wine and Chocolate Torte is a MUST! The red wine sauce totally compliments the chocolate. Simply delicious. The staff brought out the Donut Holes and Smoked Chocolate with a nice display for my friend's birthday. Very charming but smoked chocolate? Very strange taste. Wouldn't recommend it unless you are feeling adventurous. Great setting and courteous staff. Most write ups I have seen list it as $-$$ but really it's closer to $$$ if you ask me.

Ordered the cheese board to start.  You get a variety of nibbles and smears with small pieces of cheeses.  Pickled squash was everywhere.  Not really a fan and yet that was the majority on the platter.  Tried the prickly pear iced tea.  It was ok. Probably won't order again.  The drink was mostly ice.  Ordered the house salad of mixed greens and salmon.  Salad was delicious, so was the tiny 2\"x2\" piece of $8 salmon.  Basically, you pay for eating in the garden.  Ok, had that experience.  Probably won't come for a meal.  It was outrageously priced for what you get.",

I was a bit worried I wouldn't have any options after looking over the menu (because of my dairy and egg allergies) but the waiter was happy to accommodate--despite them having just changed the menu the night before. I ended up having the smoked salmon salad which was topped with pork rinds! It was super original and tasty. The dressing was great too; they must make it in house. Will definitely be back on my next trip back to the gardens.   One suggestion: I would love if they could add a \"vegan\" distinction to dishes along with the existing \"vegetarian\" one. It'd make it easier for people with dietary restrictions to identify their options better :)",

The wait time was long and we had to raise hand to catch waiter attention for order. The menu layout was not good for that kind of lighting. We were very disappointed with the food. They really need new chef for that menu price. I never been had bad experience with waiter in restaurant. When we dine the waiter did not say good evening, how was the food, do you need more water, do you want to order dessert, etc. Even though the food taste is disappointing, good service will make it much better.  This really bad service reflected how bad is manager leadership there.  The good things is they have indoor and outdoor seating area. Would not return due to bad service and disappointing in food taste.",

My mom enjoyed the BLT with fried green tomatoes, crispy bacon, fresh leafy lettuce, and a delectable remoulade sauce. I may have spelled that incorrectly! French fries were crispy and hot.

When he delivered the dessert he made it clear to me it was 16 minutes, not 20 minutes since the order was placed. He went on to complain about how busy they were and how everyone wanted dessert at the same time.   I don't need an argumentative and excuse making restaurant manger.  There were no refills on the coffee and to replace a goat cheese something on my chocolate dessert with a tiny scoop of ice cream was $3.00.

I'm from southern Louisiana, and maybe my tastebuds have remained particular about seasoning/spices since my childhood. This year, the food has declined in flavor. I think maybe based on my  smoked salmon salad today, that the kitchen is trying to be too creative. The top layer - before dressing and croutons was tasty. After that, it was too many conflicting flavors.  My friend said of  the pork dish he ordered was just ok, the pork flavorful, the sides/sauce? bland.  If I could give 2.5 stars, I would because the staff and atmosphere was excellent as usual. The drink choices - great, dessert - my blackberry sorbet rocked.",

    "text": "Sometimes it is the little things that finally throw you over the edge.  I have been back to Gertrude's a few times since my first review--I got a membership because I knew I would have lots of opportunities to take folks to the Chuhily exhibit.   As a result because Gertrude's is there I have ended up eating there.  Each time the experience has been impacted either by food that is bland to terrible to service that is so off and on.  Today however has given me the resolve to not go back.  Had breakfast there with a friend--ordered hot tea--they had no honey--for me not having honey is like for some folks not being able to drink black coffee.  Okay I get it sometimes you run out of things.  breakfast was two eggs, bacon, one slice of toast and six or seven fingerling potatoes--price point $12--not exactly inexpensive, but i get that the setting is gorgeous--food was okay--neither the best or worst eggs I have ever had  but here comes the little thing----they charge for jam for your one piece of toast.  they brought two tablespoons in a little bowl and for the privilege of having a little something sweet on your toast, you are charged a $1.50--but it's homemade they said--  In theory--I would hope that a restaurant at the level Gertrude's is attempting to be--that everything is homemade.  This charge offended my sensibilities of fairness and reasonableness--it can only be a slippery slope down to charging if you want silverware to eat with.    That's it--I won't be back--for a $12 breakfast, a tablespoon of jam (which is what was used)  should not have a surcharge--  I am not sure what the Gertrude's business model is, but I hope there is some planning ahead when there are no longer stunning works of art to  lure people in--I can't imagines locals coming to this restaurant--just because---there are so many other choices--some also with views, who have the sense that good business model for exceptional dining experiences is not to nickle and dime people.",

Warm cauliflower salad-soooo good, the dressing was amazing. The daily veg side dish was delicious, root veg mix with some kind of vinaigrette. The greens with smoked chicken salad on the side were really good, some kind of smoky mayo to add a kick. And don't forget the non-al (!) drinks, the blackberry lemon cilantro seltzer was fresh and delicious, slightly sweet and herby. The service was great, everyone was really nice, and the setting in the garden was beautiful. Walking up to the restaurant at night was beautiful, with lights on the trees, you should walk thru the park before you eat.",

    "text": "It is unfortunate that once again I write an unfavorable review for this establishment.  I do give seriously high marks to the owner of Gerturde's, Ms. Chantal H. for reaching out to us after reading our review of what was a really terrible experience at her establishment on December 29th of 2015.  She informed me in her email that her GM, Ms. Michelle Jacob was advised to contact us, yet to date there has been no communication from the management what so ever.  Actions do speak volumes, thus by the treatment our party experience the 29th of December, compounded by the apathy to our experience by the GM along with the mixed reviews here on Yelp, one can only assume that customers are just not that important at Gertrude's.    For us, Gertrude's atmosphere and cost of cuisine does not outweigh the garden variety placation one may expect to receive should issues arise.  For a setting inside the beautiful Desert Botanical Gardens, a patron should perceive a tranquil and welcome experience. One enveloped by the sensation of amazing cuisine combined with your grateful content for the service given for your patronage.  But alas, none of this is evident, from all accounts observing the staff of Gertrude's the many times we have visited the Gardens, there is something missing, and from our experience we now know what that is.....   ownership of one's profession.  Not just pride in a job well done, but the professional demeanor and presence one gives when conducting themselves in their pursuit.  It is evident that not all customers are displeased with Gertrude's, and yet one can not help but wonder why there is so many unfavorable reviews for what \"should be\" a five star restaurant in the heart of one of the most beautiful places in Phoenix.",

    "text": "I ate here with my boyfriend's big family for the first time for Sunday brunch, and I must say that I definitely left fully satisfied!!  I gave this restaurant five stars because:  1.)  Service is excellent! We had a group of 14 people and not once did I have to flag down a waitress, might I add that we did have two waitresses though but they both attended to our every want and need. I never ran out of coffee nor water.  2.)  The food is DELICIOUS!!! An assortment of toasted bread came out ahead of our entrees with what seemed to look like homemade whipped butter (not sure if it was homemade and whipped but it seemed that way). The breads were very flavorful, some with grains and spices, some with just spices, etc... Just excellent toasted bread and butter that tasted differently than any other bread I've tasted at other restaurants.  Their hummingbird nectar that came with my coffee is superb!!!!! Yes, you heard right, hummingbird nectar!!! You can have sugar, Splenda, etc., but if your coffee didn't come with hummingbird nectar make sure to ask your waitress for some so you can at least try it! It was my first time ever trying the nectar and it definitely won't be my last... Now if I can just try to find some to keep in my home for my coffee, or tea or everything!  As for our entrees, everyone loved their food! A lot of us ordered their signature dish (\"Hot Mess\") which was what the waitress recommended--we were all impressed! The chef made the \"Hot Mess\" particularly in the huevos rancheros version for that day; It included green chile pork, poblano mole, Az. Cheese Co jack cheese, crow's dairy quark, and cotija cheese in between layers of tostadas topped with two sunny side up eggs. You can bet on it that I will be back to eat the \"Hot Mess\"! My mouth is watering thinking about it...  We had them make a cake (calling a week beforehand) for the celebrant and it was delectable!! They were also very organized with their slicing of the cake and plating/serving. The cake was a strawberry shortcake, but it was definitely no strawberry shortcake I've ever tasted. The cake was perfect--not too sweet, not too dry, not too wet/moist...it was just the right amount of ingredients! We all loved it!  I assure you that whatever you decide to get at Gertrude's you will not be disappointed. I will absolutely positively return as a happy and hungry customer!",

The chef cooks food with sauces that have a Cajun quality and accent the dishes. For desert we shared a flowerless chocolate cake complemented with bittersweet chocolate and whip cream with toasted nuts.  The wait staff gave us recommendations and described the dishes perfectly. We will definitely return and bring friends with us.

We asked our server about gluten-free dishes and he explained how the food prep was separated in the kitchen, but in a very dismissive way. We've learned to pay close attention to our server's demeanor when it comes to gluten cross contamination, so, in the nicest way possible, I asked another employee just to double check that his order would be gluten free. What can I say - I don't like to see my husband get sick. The result was a series of visits from our server and the owner, who both explained and re-explained their food prep policy and how it was already explained to us when we ordered. There was no \"Hey, I'm sorry you got that impression from your server, but he was right, we do prep gluten containing items in a totally separate area\", which we would have been happy with. Instead they both took turns awkwardly talked over us while we smiled and nodded while trying to enjoy our breakfast. I don't know how many times they explained that the owners daughter has Celiac and how the gluten-y food prep line was separate. WE GET IT. Long story short, they completely missed the point. I wouldn't have double-checked if our server wasn't so dismissive to begin with.",

I had made a reservation for 6:15 but arrived a bit early so we had a drink at the bar. The bartender, Sam, was wonderful and the garden rita was delicious. Then we were seated on the gorgeous patio and looked forward to a great evening.   Our waiter did not show up for a while and when he did he was completely disengaged and clearly did not want to be there. He knew nothing about the menu, had no recommendations and just seemed plain grumpy. At one point he even told us that he was supposed to get off at 6:00 - so why did he take our table when our reservation was after that time?! My friend asked if we could order the special macaroni and cheese that the bartender had us salivating over when he described it because it was my birthday. He did bring out a very small cup of macaroni and cheese with a candle but it was not the special macaroni and cheese, just one from the kids menu.   When we were about halfway done with our food, he did not offer us more drinks or dessert, just brought the check. When I said we wanted to order dessert he seemed upset and we felt like we were causing a big hassle. I felt embarrassed that I had suggested Gertrude's. The food was good but not worth putting up with the bad service.  After we paid our check we were still hanging out talking and he was gone. Nobody else came by to offer water, thank us for coming or anything. Very disappointing birthday experience . I'm giving 2 stars only because of the previous good experience with the hope that things improve.",

I used to work in Scottsdale, and my girlfriend worked in Phoenix so this was the place we decided to meet halfway one day. We each brought a friend.   First off, the signage isn't so good. This place is in the middle of the botanical gardens and Yelp could only get me so far, and that was to the parking lot. After wondering around a bit we did find the place.   The service was just plain slow. They weren't very busy, but the waitress managed to disappear for 20 minutes at a time.   My friend and I both got the 3 napkin smoked swine at the waitresses recommendation. Neither one of us were blown away. It was different that I expected for one. I saw a picture on Yelp that was supposed to be that sandwich and what came out was not that. It's an open face sandwich broken into four pieces. So it basically looked like four pieces of bruschetta and then a bowl that took up 1/2 the plate filled with a sauce for dipping. The sauce just didn't have a lot going on in my opinion. It wasn't spicy, it wasn't rich, it wasn't salty, it just lacked identity. The pork itself was smoked to perfection so I will not take that away from them.   In the end, I'm guessing they have some great food there, but I missed it on the day I visited and had bad service. Unfortunately, I no longer live in the valley and can't say I will be going back to give it another shot when I visit.",

The service was sloppy, I felt the waiter was disappointed to have another table. He was curt and when pouring water would reach over my plate right in front of my face to fill the glass of person next to me. He had plenty of room to step around the table to serve on the right but just leaned over me instead. He did this several times, once right when I was talking the friend across the table. Really rude and awkward, not to mention he did this when pouring hot beverages as well. Other diners were also complaining of the service including one guy that went to use the restroom and was locked out because it was closing time. I guess you could have kept the hostess at the door a little longer. At 9:00 the staff started sweeping the floor even though there were quite a few diners left and food was still coming out of the kitchen. Nothing like feeling unwanted. The food was good but that is not enough if the staff is rude.",

That happens but for an upscale restaurant they didn't compensate very well; we had to ask for some apps on the house. The service was fine but not remarkable. I had the Ham Steak which was a good portion but way to salty. The baked beans that came with the fried chicken were underdone but the chicken was good. I recommend getting a salad and adding the steak as that was the best meal that others had. The steak was well cooked and tender.  Overall, it was not worth the price. There are much better places for a nice dinner. It would be a fine place for a drink before the special exhibits but the bar was pretty full from what I saw. So, go to special exhibits, enjoy the botanical garden, leave the underwhelming and expensive dinner to the tourists.",

They said \"we will do a birthday desert for your mom and we will have a high chair ready at the table\". I thought this was sweet. But the high chair wasn't ready at the table, No big deal. They brought one over. But the service was soooooo slow. We never got bread for the table but every other table had some. And my mom never got her birthday desert. We were afraid to ask for it because we didn't want to wait another 25+ minutes for a desert. I'm just sad my mom didn't get that experience I hoped for her. But again, the food was good.",

We make this at home weekly and I can make better at home. Once again had no seasoning or flavor.    We both ordered the burgers for dinner and once again NO FLAVOR. I don't understand how you can screw up a burger and potatoes(they don't have fries). Overall I was very disappointed and embarrassed as I recommended the restaurant.

Ordered: Cactus Cosmo to drink. - soooooo good.  Not too sweet!  Bread & Butter - Yes.  So amazing! $6 and the butter is just incredible.   Kids Mac & Cheese and an order of apple sauce. - I always taste my kids food.  No complaints!  Apple sauce was so good!  Korean Chicken Thighs served over Brussel sprouts. - So delicious!  The thighs were fried so well and the sauce was spicy but not to the point where you can't enjoy it.  The Brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly!  This was such an enjoyable dish!  More than a generous serving too!  I ate half and felt perfectly satisfied!  If you don't like spicy, this isn't your ideal meal.  Husband had the Bison Tenderloin - \"phenomenal\" (his words.  I didn't try it, too raw for me).   I'd recommend eating here & sitting outside, it's very nice!",

My husband ordered the Gertrude's Burger. That thing was massive! It was cooked well, and very juicy. The side potatoes were really tasty, too.

Personally, I went with the Bison Tenderloin accompanied by a duo of yucca croquettes.  It exceeded my expectations, and at $36, I would order it again... even though the accompanying steak sauce was fashioned with Huitlacoche (wheat-a-la-coochie), who's street name is \"Corn Smut\".  You can look it up for the gory details.  The entree was indeed wonderful, although the Green Chile Hummus, Stuffed Frybread, and Smoked & Fried Tofu appetizers left me under-whelmed.  I'm a lightweight, and the Peach Cobbler cocktail was a little strong for this teetotaler.  I'll stick with my pineapple vodka.  For dessert I went with the Pichuberry cobbler... wouldnt do it again, and I wasnt a fan of the coconut ice cream it showed up with.  The Ricotta Donut Holes were delightful, but I think the Best In Show had to go to the Goat Cheese Personal Cheesecake.  Great presentation!  All in all, I'd return... sans Gertrude",

    "text": "The Arizona Cactus and Native Flora Society. Doesn't that sound kind of like the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts League? That was the group of hens Lucy and Ethel joined and then had to convince Ricky to direct the league's annual fundraiser while Marion Strong cackled like a rooster when she entered the room with her ugly hats. Yeah, I remember \"I Love Lucy\" not from its original run (despite rumors to the contrary) but from the reruns that played over and over again after school. But the Arizona Cactus and Native Flora Society was a real group in 1936 headed by a Phoenix social doyenne named Gertrude Wilson.  She spearheaded the effort that resulted in the gorgeous Desert Botanical Garden in Papago Park (review: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2iTMXzG&s=88be75819b5e9483f47296166cf77368aa279d98c3f1fa14d57ed3552237ba50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2iTMXzG</a>), so it came as no surprise that the adjoining restaurant was named after her. I came in here after a couple of hours in the blazing sun as I was studying the various cacti along the walkways. It was a pleasant, country-club-style space that appeared to attract customers in their golf shorts. I still had plenty of time to get back to the airport to catch my flight, so a light lunch sounded like a reasonable option here. Since there were only a couple of couples at the bar, I must have amounted to the lunch rush since Gertrude's is not the type of place that spontaneously attracts passers-by.  I decided to go for the $12 Arugula Salad with pomegranate seeds, candied pecans, and blue cheese, all of it drizzled with an agave vinaigrette (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2zD6HxC&s=9e6b2f5e6e8ff58c0bcbe191cef8f09b6a844298e849a6c45ca9d6f55ae0baeb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2zD6HxC</a>). Quite a mound of leafage and quite tasty. For a side, I went for the $7 Roasted Vegetables which was quite a cornucopia of root vegetables, potatoes, and squash, all of them drenched a bit too much in olive oil but I wasn't complaining (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2zCitst&s=5ad37c72a79b23e511acf1946c63d9413009ee0bebedfc8cccaeb674ba98aafc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2zCitst</a>). It was most satisfying. Truth be told, I could have sneaked in an add-on of flat-iron steak for $9, not bad for five ounces, but I showed more discipline than I normally do on a business trip. Gertrude would have likely disapproved anyway.  FOOD - 4 stars...light fare well done if not too creatively, a bit too much oil on those veggies AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...casually upscale place seems a good fit for the cacti garden SERVICE - 4 stars...quite attentive...who else was there to serve? TOTAL - 4 stars...\"Welcome to the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts League...Marion, stop cackling. I've been waiting 10 years for you to lay that egg!\"",

    "text": "Gertrude's  Overall a \"so-so\" experience but right off the bat the prices are on the higher side and quality is mediocre. Of the 7 dishes we ordered 1 was flat out insipid (crab dip) had to return it. The other - vegan bowl had no particular flavor - just a hodgepodge. The dressing for the salad was very salty. The Three Sister soup was a bland soup and the portion was quite little while the bowl it was served in was huge. I think this restaurant needs a new menu and a chef who at least tastes his own food. The service was average.",

    "text": "Well, it's been two years since my original review, so I thought it was about time to stop by and see what's new at Gertrude's, and update my review.  First of all, I completely stand by my original review, which I've included below.  As I mentioned, Gertrude's is the adorable restaurant cafe at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona.  Just as a note, you don't need to purchase tickets for the Desert Botanical Garden to get into Gertrude's.  Gertrude's is still charming, and it was super busy, especially for a late lunch on a Wednesday afternoon.  I found a nice spot at the bar, and the bartender/server, Jimmy, greeted me and made me feel completely welcome.  I started with the Matcha Bramble, but with vodka, instead of gin. Super Scrummy!  I tried two appetizers: poached shrimp and jicama, and the morsels cheese plate with accoutrements.  The poached shrimp was a fresh spicy salad with jicama, cucumber, watermelon chunks, feta, and roasted pumpkin seeds.  The morsels plate had a nice mixed of cheeses, brie, bleu, and a spicy cheddar, and was served with dates, pickled cauliflower, beets, carrots, cranberries. It was very, very good.  I then tried the Cactus Cosmo, which is a gorgeous drink, but a tad dry, so I had Jimmy add a bit of berry syrup, which made it perfect.  Finally, I had to try the fresh cobbler. It takes about 15 minutes to cook, so make sure to order it ahead of time, or be prepared to wait. It was definitely worth the wait. Although, it was served with a bitter lemon sorbet, which was delicious, albeit an odd choice.  During my visit, I had the chance to meet Chef Mark Bookhamer, and local gardener, Carl Seacat, of Seacat Gardens, who Phoenix New Times calls his designer vegetables \"pure art.\"  CONCLUSION   Gertrude's is a lovely, lovely, upscale casual establishment, with consistently superb and creative selections, and a staff dedicated to fine dining service.  5/5 RECOMMEND   ***************ORIGINAL REVIEW*************** *************************************************  BACKGROUND   Gertrude's at the Desert Botanical Garden is amazing!  Okay, let's start at the beginning...  I took my mom to the opening night of Las Noches de Las Luminarias and the Bruce Munro exhibition at the Desert Botanical Garden.   Immediately to the right is Gertrude's restaurant. It looks cute from the outside, but it's attached to the gift shop, so I didn't know what to expect.  I was so pleasantly surprised in every way!  The layout was very effective with the bar as the focal point and plenty of seating. The decor was charming and edgy.  THE WINE  The wine list is very interesting. Although not extensive, it's has all the current yummies that all compliment the cuisine. I was very impressed.  There are plenty of drink specials & cocktails too.  THE MENU   The food is epic: Very creative & original.   Gertrude's takes fresh ingredients from from artisans and farmers from around Arizona and the Southwest to make their delicious creations.   Appetizers include: Cheese & Charcuterie Plate Tepary Bean \"Hummus\" (which I had - see pics) Burrata  Bouchot Mussels (which I had - see pics)  Salads/Soups Burgers/Wraps  Entrees include: Chicken Cassoulet  Peppered Hawaiian Tuna Niman Ranch Ham Steak Carolina Gold Rice Grits Cider Cured Duck Breast Blackened Scallops (which I had - see pics)  Desserts include: Donuts & Sauces 7 Red Wine/Chocolate Torte (which I had - see pics) Ice Cream Sandwich Trio Panna Cotta  SERVICE EXPERIENCE   The staff bent over backward to be helpful.  CONCLUSION   5/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *Hours: Mon - Fri 10:30am - 9pm Sat/Sun 8am - 9pm Brunch: Sat/Sun 8am - 4pm  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgertrudesrestaurant.net&s=d8f79a54cc6d42f0b711f9a61a666cdfc1089b52b75fe702c608d42f92fe455b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">gertrudesrestaurant.net</a>",

    "text": "Kimchi & Dairy.   Hmmmm, Ok I rate this place for atmosphere, set-up, loudness, ambience, location at Botanical Gardens, the gift shop a 4 to 5 stars. The wait staff was excellent, polite and accommodating.  However, my ratings are focused on food taste, quality, presentation, creativity, the standard fare.  Lets start with cocktails, Figgy Manhattan a great tasting innovative and definitely different.  The garden 'Rita was very good as well tasty and refreshing, Agave 75 another excellent cocktail - for the granddaughter she had the lemon basil lemonade, an innovative and great mixologist - I don't think you can go wrong here.  Appetizers; we shared the Elote Fritters and Green Chile Hummus - both looked great and tasted excellent -  we truly appreciated both the corn meal with a few whole corn kernels in the fritters were naturally sweet and delightful bites.  The hummus was good - a little runny due to the roasted infused herbs veggies inside.  But great flavor and innovative.  Ok we should have stopped ordering food here and this would have been a four star review.  But we wanted some entrees....  We ordered the Korean Fried Chicken Thighs, Shrimp Risotto, Seared Scallops, Wild Boar in Green Chile and Macaroni and Cheese for children dish.  The Wild Boar was a very good meal, good value for quality and great taste.  Would recommend again.  The Mac and Cheese meal was great as well.  The rest is why this is only getting the few stars - the Risotto had no taste - other than the color being a nice orange from something but no bite or flavor from the red chile, a basic Milanese saffron risotto has four times the flavor of this baby food.  Maybe they toned it down to try and bring out the Huitlacoche which wasn't tasted at all.  The rice was undercooked not just el dente, edible but not the creamy texture one would expect.  The prawns were bland tasteless standard cheap farmed raised with no flavor, they were slightly overcooked but not enough to destroy the flavor.  I usually toss prawns like this because it makes me think of eating a non food item.  The pecorino cracker and the green beans, haricot verts were the best part of this dish.  The scallops - a whopping $36 for three scallops, cooked fine, but the red beet mole and forbidden rice made this dish another near tasteless plate and at $12 per scallop or $6 per bite!  Arghhh  ok we are picky because we love good seafood.  These were obviously frozen too long or soaked in fresh water for several days to ensure no sand or flavor was left in them.    The \"Korean Fried Chicken Thighs with Brussels Sprouts, Kimchi Vinaigrette, Yogurt, Sesame Seeds and Korean BBQ\" (their description).  My wife (Korean raised in Korea) ordered this.  We all tasted.  A complete and total failure of a dish that sounds great but gone way bad.  First of all nothing is BBQ that was tasted or visible never the less Korean BBQ.  The word Korean BBQ needs to be used with respect, kind of like calling a slow roasted chuck roast a Chateaubriand.  The chicken we were told was twice fried, deep fried that is, with a breading - kind of like KFC fried chicken with this regurgitated (I'm being nice) kimchi, yogurt and maybe some gochujang in it sprinkled with sesame.   The chef should be fired for this one.  What a disgusting dish.  Fermented Spicy cabbage aka kimchi does not easily mix with dairy.  And  the Brussel Sprouts were way underdone - frankly nearly raw!  A total waste --  My wife and I have been developing and making Korean (and other Asian) and Western fusion cuisine for nearly 40 years and even some of our way out experiments never were this bad.  It was disgusting.  We see some chefs trying to add Korean flavors into their menus but this is NOT THE WAY TO DO IT and will turn anyone that understands True Korean flavors and cusine off....  Like I said analogous too ordering a Chateaubriand with the proper sauce in a French restaurant and then served a poorly done chuck roast or lesser quality diner meatloaf.  I would never order an entree at this place.",

    "text": "The food quality and taste was great and so were the specialty drinks.  I ordered a Tombstone LIT drink.  I have to remove a couple stars for a few reasons. 1.  Our server was less then happy to be there.  He never smiled and did not know the specials when we asked.  He did go and find out, but when he told us the special he said that the tuna would be medallions cooked medium (because that is the only way they cook them).  When they served the tuna there was no \"medallion\", but instead what was served was seared tuna (nearly rare) cut into 1/4\" slices and served with 3 small tortillas and a mango salsa.  Not exactly as described, but it was good.  Thankfully I like seared or raw tuna.  2.  We asked to be seated indoors since it was hot and we did not want to deal with fly's on our food all meal.  When we were seated the door to the outdoor patio was closed.  A quarter of the way into our evening and about 10 minutes before our main entree arrived they opened and propped the door to the patio open and in came the flies.  We ended up eating our dinner while swatting 3 nagging flies away.  There is so much potential here, but as it stands I cannot rate it higher than a 3 star.",

We chose to dine on the patio where flowers were in bloom and a center fountain adds a relaxing touch to your meal.  Our server was Kristen, and was excellent! She was super friendly & helpful and had a fun & cheery personality.  The Elote Fritters were delicious corn hush puppy type creations. Make sure you try them!! The brussel sprouts could have been cooked a touch more, but they had a nice spicy flavor.  The Vegan Grits were ok, but disappointing. First of all, if you are from the South, you know your grits....and these are unlike anything I've ever had.  They were more like farro. As you can see in the picture I posted - all the veggies came on top so you can't even see the 'grits'.  At Kristen's suggestion, we stirred everything together and that was much better. But I have to say that we didn't love it and would not order it again.  While this place isn't cheap, I would eat here again as it is in a lovely location and it is so enjoyable to stroll among the gardens before and after you eat.",

Asked for a manager who told us it was not possible to change our table to one with different chairs, but that they would bring iron chairs over to the table we we at. It all seemed so ridiculous and unwelcoming, the fact that they couldn't reseat us in the beginning (plenty of tables open for same waitress) and then to make us the center of attention by arguing with us that the best they could do is change out chairs in a big fuss.

While there were a lot of people dining, I was glad that our table wasn't on top of another table.   The taste: bison carpaccio - a little heat, but not something you find everywhere. delicious. We also had their green chilies pork, and their veggie sandwich. Maybe we enjoyed these more after being out of the country for a week, as we were just in Phoenix on a layover, but I don't think so. Dessert was 5 toasty donut holes, with chocolate sauce, salted caramel, and lime curd. All three delicious. I wish I could have licked the plate. Also, the basil berry lemonade.....yum.  My face: Not a cheap place - our lunch set us back about $60, but what a great way to start a trip to the beautiful botanical gardens.  If we ever have a layover in Phoenix again....I'd be very tempted to go back.",

The chef created fabulous dishes using blended ingredients that left your palette salavating for another bite. The golden yellow beet salad accompany with fresh arugula and a light dressing was excellent. The Opa was a nice, thick cut of blackened fish served southwestern style. The dessert was a dark chocolate torte cake blended nicely with whipped cream, almonds and milk chocolate.   I definitely was impressed and to top it off, you have to cool off with the jalapeno margarita. The best cocktail serve for $10.",

Now for Gertrude's  The DBG has worked for years to get a full service restaurant on the property and have finally Nailed It!   The restaurant is a large open space with a sliding wall that opens to the patio and encased with ceiling high windows that offer views to indoor diners.  Gertrude's offers Farm to Table Ingredients. A huge undertaking by a restaurant that is going to feed the masses during the Chihuly Exhibit! Yet on a recent visit to the Farmer's Market I ran into the chef loading out copious amounts of local produce before heading to the restaurant.   The menu ranges from OMG I have to have it, to items even my Aunt Liz can look at and have little or no questions about or order without modification. Like the Niman Ranch Burger prepared the way it's described and Med Rare!",

    "text": "\"Last of the Summer Wine\" -  for anyone who isn't a British comedy fan - this comedy provides the audience with an escape and a relaxed stroll through the green rolling hills near a small English village. Time feels endless; a day never seems to end; and stress just melts away.   That is the afternoon I just spent with friends at Gertrude's. But I wasn't in the rolling hills of Britain. I was at the Desert Botanical Gardens and the new restaurant named Gertrude's. I was completely relaxed. There was no rush. My stress had melted with every sip of the Gardenrita (their featured margarita). I felt quiet and peaceful. I was happy just being where I was.   We ordered off the Interlude Menu. After a slow \"light lunch\" of grilled pizza, smothered fries, beet salad, and, of course, the Gardenrita, we were ready for a quiet stroll through the gardens . . . but, wait, perhaps a few more minutes on the patio . . . a cup of coffee would be nice and some ricotta donut holes, with warm hot fudge, lemon curd and strawberry jam, yes, that would be in order. I am a strong believer that you should always finish a \"light lunch\" with something sweet and a great cup of coffee. We did.  What a great way to spend what was probably one of the last cool, breezy days of spring. In the mid-70s. Just enough warm mid-afternoon sun to warm the freckles on my bare arms. Just enough sweet and coffee to warm the cockles of my heart. Our afternoon lunch Interlude was exquisite . . . it was the last of the perfect Spring weather on a patio made for relaxing.",

Fred, the bartender, greeted us promptly.  He recommended the Littleneck Clams for a starter.  They had a vibrant full-flavored ham-hock broth.  My Fiance ordered Korean Fried Chicken thighs, they were very tasty - crispy on the outside and moist, tender chicken.  The sauce with yogurt was a perfect blend of heat and yogurt.  I ordered the Blackened Scallops, some of the best I have tasted - cooked to a perfect medium.  For dessert we had a gluten-free chocolate cake.  We enjoyed the tasty meal and the fantastic service from Fred.  Look forward to going back for brunch!",

    "text": "What an amazing new addition to one of Phoenix's already amazing offerings (DBG).  I was lucky enough to partake in the \"soft\" opening this week at Gertrude's (opening officially tomorrow).   First glance the decore is very nice, minimalist, and works very well with the rest of DBG. Sound is absorbed very well, so what looks like would be a very loud restaurant is actually very pleasant. Then when you look further you get a little peak into the kitchen from the dining room and you can see the awesome room they have for the \"Chef's table\". They even have a very large patio, which I didn't notice 'til our way out, as it was freezing (well for Phx anyway) outside and I wanted nothing to do with the outside that evening. It looks to have seating for upwards of 50 and has great views. Happy hour on the patio anyone?!  Being our first time we wanted to make sure to try everything we could:  Lamb Stuffed Ravioli - delish! the beans were a bit on the tough side, but might just not be my taste.   Breakfast & Brussels - my favorite thing all night. I love brussels sprouts and the preparation of this dish is excellent. Brioch toast with an egg int he middle and a brussels with bacon and caramelized onions salad, i cant wait to have more!  Grain salad - quinoawith micro greens and a maple lemon vin dressing. Very tasty, my dad who doesn't like quinoa love it.   Braised veggie - Swiss chard with a goat cheese creme, very well done  Fingerling Potatoes - triple fried, needed a tad extra salt, but you cant go wrong with these.   Entree Swine - basically pork four ways. I am not a huge pork fan, but all four ways were yummy! Their house made sausage was the best, tons of flavor!  Snapper - I have never had snapper before, but it was a yummy light white fish, served with Swiss chard, fingerlings and pancetta, very tasty!  Red Chili Short Ribs - my favorit presentation plate of the night, smoky, tender and delish, I will probably get these next time I am in for dinner.   Dessert Milk & cookies - adorable idea, excellent chocolate milk and three different types of cookies, my dad plate was clean when we were ready to eave so I think he liked it.   Dough nuts + Sauce - my choice, very good, warm dough nut holes with three dipping sauces. I wanted the chocolate souffle but it takes 30 minutes to make, so remember to order it early.  Everything was great and we had a wonderful time.  Note: to get there park by the gardens entrance, go through main gate and you will see the restaurant on the right hand side as you walk in.   Enjoy!",

Local beers on tap and a host of original libations. I will definitely frequent this place when visiting phoenix.",

We also noticed the celery sticks with olives and lemons ready for Bloody Mary's that looked like they had been there for over one week.  Actually a server used one and we even commented to him how gross they looked!  He then proceeded to reach in with his hands to man handle the olives and then grabbed straws from the top and put them in the glass!  We ordered the chicken wrap and beam hummus which was one of the worst wraps and hummus we have ever eaten.  The chicken in the wrap was dry and had no flavor.  The chips looked like they were from the bottom of the grease pan and we couldn't tell what we were eating regarding the hummus as it didn't have any flavor either.  Giving it even one star is generous!",

    "text": "Gertrude's at The Desert Botanical Garden is a very unique concept  to arrive at DBG. You do not need to pay garden admission to dine at the restaurant. Those who pay to enter the garden have a wristband. If you have not visited the garden you must do so.  We were celebrating 2 August birthdays and had lunch and ordered the 3 napkin smoked swine sandwich with fries for $13.,the small beet salad for $6, and the mahi tacos with beans for $17. It was Winey Wednesday the day we visited which means all bottles are 1/2 off. So we chose the DSB Pinot Grigio which is from Rutherford winery. Very nice light wine.  There is a nice large outdoor patio for seating that was not utilized in August, but I am sure as soon as the heat dies down it will be very well used. The actual restaurant is not too large for seating. The bar looks very well stocked and the kitchen is open concept.  Happy Hour is daily from 3pm-6pm and beer & house wine is $5. $2 off house cocktails. No appetizer specials at this time. Other daily specials are M & F happy Hour all day T- $7 all day you call it W- 1/2 off bottles of wine Th-$5 draft beer Sun.- $6 Sangria's  Parking is complimentary at the garden,just need to walk a bit depending on where you have to park to the garden entrance. I believe the ceramic designs on the wall are done by artist Jim Sudal from Scottsdale. I would recommend you try it once,probably not going to be my hang out,just because of the prices. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with menu suggestions.",

    "text": "Thinking about going here for a before-show dinner some evening?  You might want to think again.  Gertrude's is set up as a fine dining restaurant but it falls short in lots of ways.  First: ambiance -- Gertrude's is located near the entrance to the Desert Botanical Garden in an area that used to be part of the gift shop.  It still looks like an empty retail space with tables and chairs arranged in rows.  Besides having the warmth of a high school cafeteria, Gertrude's is incredibly noisy.  Strike one. Note: There is also a more inviting outside dining area if the weather is cool enough.    Second: service -- the kitchen is way too slow.  We arrived almost an hour and a half before our show time to find a 1/3-filled restaurant.  Our server asked if we had to get out in time for a show and we told her.  Thirty minutes later our appetizers arrived.  Thirty-five minutes after that I was ready to walk out because there was scarcely time left to eat before our show.  Our server kept telling us just a few more minutes.  In the end we got our main courses barely in time to eat them, and certainly with no time for dessert.  Strike two.  Third: food - spotty.  For example, the pork trio had delicious thinly-sliced leg, but the sausage was blank and the pork loin dried out.  The short ribs were blah.  The burrata appetiser was very small for the price, and the bread (you need to order it separately for about $6) was a berry loaf of some kind that didn't work well with anything else we ordered.  That's right - no free bread.  Strike three.  Good points:  The price was halfway reasonable for fine dining.  Too bad this wasn't fine dining, which is after all about a total experience and not just the food.  A couple of the items we were served were very tasty.  The Desert Botanical Garden itself is fabulous.  That's about it.  Sorry.",

    "text": "As anyone can see, I am not a prolific nor a negative reviewer. However, this evening the experience at Gertrude's calls for exposure to the public and the business owner. Earlier this week, I made a reservation for two at 8:30 p.m. on Saturday in conjunction to the special Sonoran Lights installation in the Desert Botanical Garden. I knew of the crowds attending this special event and the great popularity from word of mouth. A reservation at 8:30 p.m. was acceptable and honestly, I expected some back-up at the restaurant. We toured the gardens and arrived at Gertrude's at 8:20 p.m. I was pleasantly surprised when the hostess informed us that they were running behind and that we might be seated 10 minutes past our reservation time. \"Can we sit at the bar and have a drink while we wait?\" I asked indicating two empty seats at the bar's front corner. \"Certainly\" I was told. As we sat, I noticed that several people were eating food at the bar and I walked back over to the hostess and emphasized that we are sitting at the bar simply to have a drink and wait, not dine. Again, I indicated and she acknowledged that we were sitting at the corner of the bar, some 8 feet at the most from the host desk. My companion and I ordered one glass of wine and settled in to be patient. At 8:55 p.m., I walked the 8 feet (maybe 6 feet) over to the host desk to inquire for the first time as I was still in my mellow and patient frame of mind. I was told that we had been called twice. I was dumbfounded. \"How can that be? We're sitting right there. You knew that we were seated right there at the corner.\" At this point, the hostess became rude, stone-face and unresponsive. In fact, she walked away and disappeared around the corner. The host then came up, also argumentative and insistent that he had yelled out our name twice. I frankly expressed my doubt and pointed out that the hostess knew exactly where we were at the corner of the bar He then became argumentative, explaining that their system is to write check-ins on these Post-It notes on the desk and work from there. They did offer to seat us in a few minutes. At this point, I simply stated that we had lost our appetite and we were leaving. As we walked out beyond the door, I heard the host loudly proclaiming to all within earshot to \"don't worry about that guy...\". I have eaten at Gertrude's several times prior. I do enjoy their food, although it can be hit or miss. What strikes me on this occasion is the unacceptable demeanor of both the host and the hostess...being rude and argumentative with any customer is never acceptable. Certainly, loud disdain expressed in earshot of the staff and other customers is doubly unacceptable. What I also noticed as we sat at the front corner of the bar 8 feet from the host desk was the overall dour and unhappy appearance of much of the staff. Yes, the Sonoran Light installation has been very popular. Yes, the restaurant is crowded, backed-up and in high demand. However, if the staff is as unhappy as they appear...and after many years of corporate management I have a keen eye for an unhappy and therefore unsuccessful staff delivering inferior customer experience...then something is fundamentally wrong with this restaurant. And at these prices, no, my expectation is not that I will be bellowed at for my table as if I was at the 7th St. Denny's from some system of Post-It notes, if indeed that was the case.",

    "text": "Prior to my first visit in 2016 I had perused the menu online and had read of a wonderful burger on offer.  When I arrived, it was off of the menu.  While many would scoff at specifically choosing a restaurant known for innovative cuisine to dine on something so pedestrian and anticlimactic, I often crave a well crafted burger for many reasons. One is that beef in 2019 does not taste as good as it did in my childhood of the 1960s. (This is a subject for an essay in itself which I will refrain from digressing into here.) Suffice to say that due to a disability as a result of an injury suffered five years ago, I can no longer produce the hand crafted burgers I used to make at home to satiate my occasional craving.  Fast forward to a visit to the Desert Botanical Garden yesterday. I entered Gertrude's and requested a menu, and the Gertie Burger was available.  I ordered it, medium rare.  No mention was made of the grade of beef used, but I can state that as a patron of restaurants who state to serve Prime grade steaks, the beef in my burger tasted better than the Prime steaks and the Prime grade standing rib roast cuts I have dined on at restaurants. It was cooked to perfection, absolute perfection. I'm glad that I asked that the Gert sauce, a house made steak sauce condiment which is normally served on the burger, was offered to be put on the side when I expressed my dislike of steak sauces. The burger is served on a nicely char-grilled bun, atop a leaf of butter lettuce, topped with Swiss cheese, and with the classic French mushroom-shallot sauteed mixture used for Beef Wellington, Duxelles. It needs nothing else. In my opinion, to add anything else, even  the chef's sauce, is overkill. There is absolutely no gristle, it's obvious the chef grinds his own beef from cuts he selects, and the flavor is pure heaven.   The burger was garnished with two house made bread and butter pickle chips, a nice touch, and a side of perfectly seasoned fingerling potatoes. The fingerlings went unfinished not for lack of flavor or appeal, but because I did not have room for them. I didn't want to be that tacky person schlepping the potatoes around the gardens in a to-go box in my mobility scooter basket, but I was tempted.  The restaurant has duck on the menu, a favorite of mine, but after having that burger I'm afraid I will be going back and will likely become a one-note client because they have the one thing I have not been able to find anywhere else, a perfect burger.  The only deterrent to my turning into a non-credit seeking Wimpy is that I live in Buckeye, so it's a ride to indulge myself and therefore, the Gertie burger is going to remain a special treat for those days when I have to travel into town.  For those of you who are closer, I say go and try it before the menu rotates again.  A heads up: Per the website, Gertrude's is going to be closed for remodeling from July 1, 2019 to September 9, 2019 for remodeling.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gertrudesrestaurant.net&s=19701d20070e8541ee9d5fd218214ecce65764f10e0120a4d0294013ea6b8ce2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">gertrudesrestaurant.net</a>",

    "text": "The setting is lovely.  We sat out on the patio surrounded by desert vegetation unlike anywhere else you might go.  It would be a nice place to take out of town guest for just that.  The menu is interesting.  The service is hit or miss,  a fact that is not to my liking.   My friend arrived first and was seated on the patio.  The manager of the restaurant told he she was particularly lucky because she would get impressive service from the  individual covering that table.  That was a nice thought. I had planned for a little nicer experience before the Ballet.   When one of the exotic drinks offered was not what they said, my friend told the waiter.  He asked if she wanted something else. to which she said some type of not to exotic bottled water.  He returned putting the bottle and glass in front of her next to the unsatisfactory drink and left. What was amusing was that she and I had questioned as to whether he'd take the unwanted drink away when returned.  She said he wouldn't  and just to push it away. I didn't want to look at that stupid drink sitting there so  I physically gave it to him after he put the bottle water and wine glass in front of her and started to leave. Now her is where I was a bit amused.  At a nicer restaurant, I might have expected the server would open the lid on the bottle for the customer and pour some in the wine glass it is served with.   Getrude's isn't one of the places.  I could see she  wasn't going to get the cap unscrewed so I just took it and did it myself. I also poured part of the glass for her.  Myself, I just drink Ice water and having it refilled during the meal would have been appropriate. I admit that I had looked for and saw the water carafe at the serving station.  I was sorely tempted to just walk across the patio and fill my own glass.  If it had been hotter, I would have.  Our waiter finally offered to refill my glass when I was almost finished with the meal, just a little late.  So my  recommendation is this.  It is a nice setting with an interesting menu but strictly more to the casual would be my assessment.  To the food.  I had the morsels appetizer for dinner.  It was enough to fill me up and offered some interesting combinations. I do like to be adventurous.   I appreciated the fact the waiter did tell me when I considered a rice dish that is was quite spicy.   My friend had the duck which was passable.  I suppose the get their duck from the farms at South Mountain? However, for a restaurant in the middle of the desert, I question one of their entrees being duck anyway.  Since my friend is well traveled, who was I to say possibly order something else.  She was not to impressed.    As a said before, it is a really pretty setting for a restaurant.  So, for a bit more expensive casual dinner, you might want to consider it.  Jeans or Khakis would be fine.  For more that that, other places are available.",

    "text": "I decided to give Gertrude a try even though my fellow Most of the Yelpers here gave her about the same review I will. If you don't mind eating with a mess of flies, and this is the place for you. We came on a very warm day to visit the botanical gardens. The patio doors -- from both the front and back sides were left open. This allowed for the invasion. Believe me, the troops of flies came swarming in.  First off they have a big board outside with all the specials. Once we were seated inside the waiter didn't even know what we were talking about as we wanted one of those specials. We ended up ordering off the menu. I ordered a grain salad bowl. It was very interesting in that it had freeka, chia seeds, nuts and seeds. It was thick and chewy and very flavorful but having the grains cold was a mindtwist for me. Couldn't decide if I liked it or didn't like it. It came topped with a little bit of dragon fruit, a touch of mango, a few beets and a touch of greens.   We shared a three sister soup. Now this was amazing! The waiter told us it was based on an ancient native American recipe. It was butternut squash soup, topped with crispy baked garbanzo beans and cilantro oil. It was so good that it almost was like drinking dessert for me anyway! Finally we shared another salad which was from their local garden. It was so beautifully displayed with an interesting variety of creamed cheese. The cheese tasted kind a like goat cheese. The only problem with this salad is for us, what is the dressing was very salty and then somebody topped the salad off with more salt. The salt practically ruined it for us and it looks so fresh.   If the flies could be controlled maybe with overhead fans and the salt could be left up to the consumer, I think this experience would have been a whole lot better for us.",

    "text": "A friend and I came to Gertrude's after a nice walk in the garden and was welcomed warmly at the bar. The overall ambiance this Friday evening around 6 was lively but not too rowdy....Lots of snowbirds we suspected given the age of the crowd.   Actual tables were reserved and the wait for one would have been 40-45 minutes and the outdoor patio seating area also seemed quite full. I'd probably sit at the bar next time as well because service was fast and you get a birds eye view of the hustle and bustle of the restaurant. Our bartender/waiter was friendly nice and gave a good recommendation for a wine. So we settled in with our drinks and had a great time. We didn't eat dinner and instead went for the apps - (gf) smoked and fried tofu with achiote and mango Chile chutney and a side of fingerling potatoes. Both were very good and I appreciated how the menu seemed exotically Arizonan-fusion with ingredients of the Sonoran desert like agave, nopales, achiote and some Asian-inspired tastes like kimchi, chutney, tofu.   The wine list is good and diverse with several as wines across white and red. This is evidenced by the average 12 dollar/glass prices but the pours are generous.   The dessert list looks intriguing and that's probably what I'll head for next time. The Abuleta's Tres Leches and the Sweet beets cheesecake looks especially tantalizing for the taste buds.   The mains / entree list had a good number of good looking meat dishes but it is very pricey. The cheapest is an $18 burger which sitting near the kitchen we noticed was always the order up.   Overall a nice place to splurge a bit after a nice afternoon in the garden. But maybe stick with drinks and people watching !",

    "text": "While I've been to our city's iconic Desert Botanical Garden numerous times, I had no idea they had a restaurant. And that's because it's only been open since 2017. That being said, we appreciated being able to eat dinner first on property with out of town family guests, and then walk right outside Gertrude's doors, to experience The Electric Desert Exhibit.   First off, the menu is filled with unrecognizable ingredients - achiote, huitlacoche, cracked freekah - but our waiter kindly gave us quick descriptions, so don't be afraid to ask! We started with Elote Fritters, fancy Hush Puppies, a little on the sweet side, but delicious nevertheless. Our second appetizer for the table was Smoked Fried Tofu: tofu triangles served crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, orangish in color because of the achiote seasoning, and a mild flavor.  The four of us ordered different main dishes: Date and Arugula Salad, with Flat Iron Steak added as protein was a pretty presentation. Steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked \"well\" (near sacrilege for most!). However, they skimped on the blackened feta and dates. Disappointing. The Shrimp Risotto hit the spot, with about six shrimp in a sea of risotto, topped w/ Pecorino Crisps (baked cheese crisps). My brother and sister-n-law who never eat fried foods, were so intrigued by the Korean Fried Chicken Thighs, they had to order them. However, Thighs tasted dry with no particular \"oomph.\" Seacat Salad, featuring seasonal mixed greens with tofu added for protein, was a winner. We savored the fresh yellow and red beets! This particular salad is dependent on what ever vegetables & greens are provided by local growers.  Going forward, we hope they refine the nuances of each gourmet dish featured, since their menu is small and changes weekly.",

Everyone seemed very happy with their dinner choices, I need to give a shout out for a couple menu items, while others struggled. Loved the corn fritters, DELICIOUS. I heard a few lips smacking over the braised beef, and hamburgers! Myself, and another ordered the shrimp risotto, missed the mark! The cheese platter was another miss, extremely salty.

I recommend getting food at the cafe. The menu layout is not good as well as I don't know why steak is an add on but hummus is a main ??? Maybe I was just in a bad mood from the heat but I just didn't really enjoy my experience. Especially seeing good options on the yelp page but they said it's only offered for dinner. So I ended up ordering the 6piece tofu and hummus plate. The tofu was actually so filling I couldn't finish it. It was just too much protein and not enough anything else. Glad I had the cucumber and carrots from the hummus plate to help the tofu go down. The flavor of the tofu was actually good just a bit too dry for the heat.   I would only recommend checking out the dinner menu. The lunch menu is not even worth it when you are hungry and tired from the sun.",

Highly recommend eating here if you are planning to go to the gardens. The best thing we had was the green chili humus. It was amazing and will just order that as my main course next time as it was that good. They have a healthy all natural menu that was simple and had a wide variety of dishes to choose from. Well worth the price. We also had our table on the patio that was breath taking. It was beautiful outside and the weather this time of year was perfect, just recommend a light jacket. A+++ experience. We are planning to go back soon.   Also on a side note that being able to make reservations online is extremely easy and convenient.",

    "text": "Booking this reservation was easy through the OpenTable app. I added a request to see if we could be sat outside that I had forgotten about. When we got there, we thought it would be great if we could sit outside so I inquired about the possibility. The hostess informed me the reservations were made for outside - awesome!  We were seated right away and Emily brought us waters right away without even prompting. The drinks were amazing! I had the Agave 75, a nice tasty bubbly drink, and a Figgy Manhattan, a tasty twist to my favourite classic drink. Others in the party had the prickly pear beer, a nice smooth beer with a hint of the fruit without the sweetness, and the specialty marg, which had some heat to it with jalapeno infused spirits.   Started the meal with crab dip, which was much like a bisque, so the crab wasn't apparent and the dip is runnier than what we were expecting. It was still tasty, as long as you go into it not hoping it's like a chunky crab-artichoke dip, you should be ok!  Kids got their food from the kids menu, which offered lots of great choices. Mac and cheese was a proper cheesy pasta. Chicken tenders came with 3 quality pieces of strips. Cheese quesadillas came in mini tortilla wraps, which is a favourite for our kids. The side of fruit option was huge and filled with super tasty fruit. The homemade applesauce side was a hit. The house made chips were yummy and super crispy.   I got braised beef - a generous portion of impressively braised meat, so tender and flavourful. My brother is a chef, and got the burger with bacon, and earned a big stamp of approval. He enjoyed the steak sauce and the mushroom paste. The fingerling potatoes could have been cut in half to really get a good crunchy texture. Hubby ordered the grains and seeds salad with smoked salmon and found it to be filling and delicious.   For dessert, we had donut holes, perfect crispy outside, soft inside, and lime butter tart with chilli peppers and toasted mallows on top. Both were AMAZING!! Highly recommend both!",

    "text": "Came into town to cheer a friend on in the Phoenix Marathon and we were looking for things to due that evening. What caught our attention was the Bruce Munro exhibit at the botanical gardens. What luck, they have a restaurant there so that is 2 birds with one stone as they say.   Due to some scheduling mishap, my party of 4 thought we had a reservation at 7 on Saturday night but it turned out to be for Sunday! . I cannot thank Max enough for the save. Thanks to what I can only consider to be good karma a large party didn't show up and thanks to a local family we were able to split the table. Yes!  We sat down just grateful that we could seated but little did we know we were in for a dinning experience. Gertrude's is another in a growing trend of farm to table and they delivered. One of us ordered the bread service with the tea butter for the table. It came out warm and with just the right amount of crunch in the crust. Excellent. Not certain I  tasted any tea in the butter but the bread was definitely better with the butter then without and that bar was already set high.    Another diner had the Gertrude's Greens salad and was quite pleased with the dressing. Just the right amount of lemon.   I splurged and ordered the flat iron steak. It came out the requested medium and was quite juicy and flavorful. The lone male in our group order the prime strip loin with bacon marmalade. He was hesitant about it until he tried it. Then he was slathering it on every bite so I guess it was good.   Someone else got the duck breast which I had a taste of. It was cider cured and amazing. I will hopefully be able to get that next time I am in town. It came with broccoli and truffle steel cut oats. Who knew oats could be served like that?  Cocktails were not weak and next time I will be getting the house margarita. It had just the right amount of heat and kick to it.     Our server Lisa was excellent. All in all a fantastic meal in a great location. Next time I am in town I will definitely try and come here for the brunch.",

Yes, it was crazy busy, due not only to Valentine's Day, but also the light show in the garden, and, according to our server, the hordes of winter visitors.  In fact, she told us that the restaurant has been packed nightly since November.  What a blessing for them.  However, how they handle it is not so wonderful.  Staff seemed frantic.  The place was so crowded, you had to dance around the staff to try move between tables. They tried to seat us literally right against another diner.  Her back was touching the table where we were supposed to sit.  My friend balked.  There were a number of 2 seat tables open in less tight spaces.  She requested and we got one...but everyone seemed horribly, rudely, and overtly put out by this.  Especially the very rude and very young (inexperienced?  incapable?) woman who was serving as the host at the front.    Blue post it notes on the menus to indicate to the person seating us, where to seat us, our party name, and the number of people in our party.  Who does that?  I asked about the practice.  Apparently, that was supposed to be the system to get us all seated in an orderly manner.  Well, considering the back up at the host's table, the system wasn't working so well.  All that to say, we ate a fast meal.  The food was decent, but the whole environment, from lighting to crowded tables to noise level to management and servers bordering on rude, made for a less than pleasant dining experience.  We just wanted to eat and get out of there.  So we did.  This place is taking full advantage of their location at a key tourist and visitor destination.  It's a shame they don't show more appreciation for their patrons.",

    "text": "My sister-in-law invited me to Phoenix for a girl's getaway. As a talented amateur photographer, she's always looking for inspiring places to shoot. We arrived at the Desert Botanical Garden to do some sunset photos, but the garden closed just 30 minutes after sunset, and we weren't willing to pay full admission for less than an hour on the grounds. We decided to come back the following night for the twice-weekly flashlight tour. But while we were there, we figured we'd stop at the park restaurant, at least for a glass of wine. We were NOT expecting much from a restaurant located within a tourist attraction. Gertrude's blew our expectations out of the water!!  We were nearly the only ones there, but as we walked in, we were impressed by the offerings at the bar. We started with prosecco, as we perused the menu. Everything looked tempting, but as we are both following a Ketogenic lifestyle, we had to be careful about what we ordered. Fortunately they had several items on the menu conducive to our dietary needs, with minimal or no tweaking. I got the Grilled Pork Tenderloin, which was Keto-compliant as described. My sister-in-law got the Gertie Burger without the bun, and substituted the fingerling potatoes with a side of Brussels sprouts. They handled her special requests with aplomb. All our food was so delicious, and the service was attentive. We would come back here in a heartbeat, if we find ourselves in Phoenix again! (In fact, we stopped by the next night for a glass of Prosecco before our flashlight tour of the gardens!)",

Based on the prices - average price of $35 per plate - you would think it would be a quaint restaurant with exceptional service.  Gertrude's is the exact opposite of what we expected.  They cram way too many tables into a small area, making it impossible to share a quiet meal.  More importantly, however, the staff is completely clueless about the restaurant.  They had no clue who the chef was and didn't know anything about chef's prior experience, nor were they interested in finding out.   For the same price, there are several dozens more intimate restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale.  We have no interest in going back.",

    "text": "Pickled grapes? Wow!  I stopped in here with my cousin during my recent visit to the Desert Botanical Garden featuring Chihuly. We wanted to grab a quick drink while waiting for the sun to set for the day. I was surprised when we checked with the hostess that they were booked full for the next 1.5 hours! Note to self and everyone else: make a reservation for evening seating.  Diners can choose indoor or outdoor seating, and the outdoor patio is heated in the cooler months. It has a classy ambiance, and the outdoor patio gives you the garden feel.  We chatted with the bartender for a while. Her cocktail knowledge shown through as we improvised a non-alcoholic drink into an alcoholic drink as well. The drinks (a spiced rum type mojito and cactus something or other tasted refreshing and light.  Service at the bar was prompt and attentive. Both food and beverages worked well together and took minimal amounts of time to receive.   We also ordered the artisan cheese plate. I liked that it came with flat, grainy chips so as to not be too filling (compared to thick bread). The three cheeses represented a good mix (soft cow cheese with ash rind, goat's cheese, and I'm at a loss on the third but it was my cousin's favorite.We did ask the bartender to re-explain which was which twice already. They did, of course, but cheerily and very willingly.   To create and change the tastes, they offered a strawberry spread (not a huge fan of strawberries, but it was still tasty) and in-house pickled grapes. Wow, those grapes were something because they also picked up hints of herbs, likely fresh from the gardens as well.    Both the bartenders and servers at Gertrude's have a flair for showing their knowledge and I appreciate when the staff can speak intelligently of the food.  The food at other tables looked divine. Portions looked great and all the diners were happy and chatting away.   I highly recommend making a reservation for a visit to Gertrude's while at the botanical gardens. I look forward to coming back in spring and sampling additional cocktails and dishes. Also,before walking over, stop in the washroom if you've already walked around because I was a little dusty from the trails and the washrooms are across from the gift store and not inside the restaurant.",

And let me tell you, it was super hot in the restaurant. The whole time I was sitting indoors, I was sweating n sticking to the leather seats.. not really what I was hoping for a fabulous Sunday brunch place especially when I reserved for indoor seating... so besides sweating through out brunch, our food took forever. It was fine since we spent the entire time catching up and ordering drinks. We had 2-3 drinks before our food finally came out. I had the red sangria... it was tasty but I have to agree with other people's reviews on the price of this place. It's definitely overpriced. But the service was great!! Our server was very attentive and was amazing!!! I had a mimosa and will probably advise not to get it... stick to their specialty cocktails instead. I also had a prickly pear margarita and it was very good. Then I got the B.L.T.E. which comes with eggs (ur choice) large strips of bacon, tomato, lettuce in between two ciabatta bread. It also came w fresh made potato chips. It was very filling and it was good. My mother had the frittata and she said it was tasty. And my husband got the steak and eggs which he thought was delicious. So the food here is very good but it's a little overpriced and I get it. You're in the middle of the botanical garden... the atmosphere is beautiful and that's what you are paying for. Just wished the indoor seating wasn't so hot...",

    "text": "Gertrude's restaurant is located behind the gift shop at the entrance of the gorgeous Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix. The restaurant serves sustainable dishes featuring ingredients from both their own patio garden and the community garden located in the Desert Botanical Garden. The ambience for dinner al fresco on the patio should be an automatic five-star experience... beautiful landscaping, lighted glass sculptures, sunset on the surrounding red rock formations, and stars shining brightly in the desert sky. The menu is seasonal, creative, and sounds delicious. Entrees run $18-40.00.  The restaurant was moderately busy and almost all of the patrons had dinner outside on my visit. Yet, not one table or place setting was set on the patio...just empty tables...no linens, placemats, candles, centerpieces, salt and pepper mills...nothing! They don't set your table even after you order.  This is acceptable for a picnic table at a roadside burger place but not an \"upscale\" dining establishment. Service was slow but hospitable (I even had to walk the bill inside to pay because I got tired of waiting.) Every table had a heat lamp. I was not offered a lamp and had to request it on a chilly night. The crafted Lavender Lemondrop cocktail simply was not good. I ordered the Arugula Salad with pomegranate seeds, candied pecans, blue cheese, and agave vinaigrette and it was delicious. The Blackened Scallops with roasted corn maque choux and Tabasco Hollandaise arrived cold and undercooked. With a $35 price tag...they were sent back to the kitchen. The second order was cooked perfectly. The maque choux was fresh and as good as any I have eaten in Louisiana. I have to say, however, my overall experience was disappointing. This restaurant makes me appreciate fine dining in Europe which is truly \"fine dining\"...food cooked perfectly, impeccable service, and attention to detail and presentation at the same price of a meal at Gertrude's. I can't wait to go back to see the Desert Botanical Gardens again but I will enjoy my meal somewhere else in the Phoenix area. Dinner, lunch, and dinner is served at Gertrude's.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gertrudesrestaurant.net&s=19701d20070e8541ee9d5fd218214ecce65764f10e0120a4d0294013ea6b8ce2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">gertrudesrestaurant.net</a>",

The food was OK.  We tried the Korean chicken, steak, arugula salad, Gertrude salad, cheese plate, hummus with sour goat's cream, ice cream, and custard.  The ice cream and cheese plate were my favorite dishes.  Five star for atmosphere and services.  If you're looking for a place for date night, this place should be on your list.",

Since my son was visiting for his birthday we thought we would try them out for dinner and then do the botanical gardens luminaries tour after our meal.  Sadly, dinner was a disappointment.  The food was just so-so.  My husband had the scallops, my son had the Korean chicken, and I had the mushroom Bolognese.  The scallops seemed undercooked and there were only 3.  The Korean chicken was overcooked which made it chewy, and the mushroom Bolognese was very unexciting and had some weird crunchy bits in the sauce that added nothing to the dish.  Two thumbs down on Gertrude's as a dinner destiny, but will keep it on our lunchtime list.",

Perhaps I am too low-brow, but I did not enjoy anything I have tried here with the notable exception of the banana bread French toast- that particular dish is amazing.  As a vegetarian, I cannot speak to the meat dishes, but the hummus was mediocre (very dry and serviced with pickled veggies), the chocolate dessert unsatisfying, and the egg dishes a bit flavorless.  Also, the portions are small for the price.  I suggest having a drink here on a quiet weekday evening, and maybe some banana bread French toast on a Sunday morning.  Other than that, I would not recommend.",

Most places the waitress would simply say that they would try to find someone and drift away.  This friendly, smiling person took our entire order even though we were not in her section.  She returned quickly with our drinks and our waiter as well.  What incredible customer service.  It made our day!  The meal and the service were perfect from that point on.

Our server was great, too: a pleasant young lady who knows the menu and was prompt and attentive. There is a decent wine list. There are a half dozen each appetizers, salads and sandwiches. What we had was good and more than we could finish. We didn't have room for dessert. The soup du jour was mushroom and well received. The burger, chicken salad sandwich and bologna sandwich were all great.  The price was on the high end for sandwiches but you have to pay for the ambiance. We will return I am sure.

Also ordered a side of Cajun corn.  The Cajun corn side was plentiful and delicious.  Good thing we ordered it as the vegetables and corn with the entrees were used as a garnish, a streak of Cajun corn under the scallops and a tossing of vegetables on top of the steak.  Both the scallops and the steaks were done well.  My vegetables were roasted to the point of being black, I mistook an asparagus spear for a baby carrot since they were all the same black overdone mess.  Waiter not friendly but got the job done.  We noted that 80% of the tables were getting the hamburgers.  It could be that this is their specialty?  Or was it the pricing?  Hamburger prices looked reasonable about $15 while our upscale entrees were in the $30 range.   If the hamburgers are their forte then they should try re-branding to get reviewed on what they do best.  Definite issue with flies, this might be better in the summer when closed up to keep the heat out.  I may try this again on another DBG visit but will stick to the hamburger.",

Two tried the Daring Dining venison which was appetizer sized but not identified as such on the menu or by the server. One said it tasted ok but the other person disliked it. Fortunately the ham portion served to the third guy was generous enough to share! Southern chicken was deemed good; scallops were very dark outside and clear/under cooked inside; Tuna requested \"medium\" came \"rare\". Some tap beers were sold out. Those who had AZ wines liked them. Want dessert in the desert? You won't find much better than salted caramel gelato; a creative attempt to meld peach and jalapeno in a frozen custard was not nearly as exciting as it sounded. Non smiling server seemed distracted and unable to note the order without repetition. If you go for an evening meal, order a burger and brew for sustenance and enjoy the outdoor ambiance without expecting fine dining.",

    "text": "I was looking for a nice relaxing lunch on a Monday after I had worked many straight days in a very busy fine dining resort restaurant.  First time dining here, and sadly, the last. We tried the house salad, the hummus, the golden rice grits, the bread, and the veggie wrap. I had previously thought that Gertrude's was a veggie friendly concept, but no.  The house salad was served wet with water and a flavorless dressing. If you charge $4 for bread, it should at least be served warm.  The butter was also flavorless. The hummus was good, especially the cauliflower because it at least had flavor.  The golden rice grits were below average, again, would using a little salt and pepper kill the chef??? And why balsamic on everything? Made the dish worse, not better. Another annoying detail, no salt and pepper on the table. My boyfriend's veggie wrap was pretty bad, too. Again, didn't taste like anything!   The service was ok, but it's essential for a busy restaurant to have support staff. There are no bussers and no food runners. So if you need your server, they are probably too busy running someone else's food. With the prices they charge this is unacceptable.   So if the ambiance is what you're looking for, well, it's beautiful, we had a great table by the fountain, but the peace was constantly interrupted by the manager moving umbrellas with heavy metal bases. So all I could hear was scrape, scrape, scrape the entire lunch. So even with one entree comped because it was barely eaten, and 2 glasses of wine, our unpleasant, barely edible lunch was still over $70. I hate being taken! I work with really talented cooks, and they would never put food out like this. The chef clearly has no palate! Well, they are busy with the captive clientele that visit the gardens. What a disappointment.  All I can say is, tourist trap.",

We shared the pablano hummus plate that offered delicious pickled veggies to compliment the tasty hummus.

Service was superior, with Scott explaining in detail all of our questions.  The restaurant was quiet enough so everyone could hear each other.  Great change from noisy restaurants! You can't go wrong here.",

    "text": "Hello - we visited a couple weeks ago - place is new this past month - loved eating out in the sunshine on the patio away from traffic.  Being at Desert Botanical Gardens makes it reallly special - nice decor - friendly people and good service. Menu - I had a salmon salad that was very good except for clumps of potato with skins that did not fit.  I would have liked another vegetable or egg.  The potato took away from my salad.  Hubby had the veggie sandwich and seemed to like it and ate it all - but his fries were no good - should be sweet potato to go with the whole idea of the place - fresh and organic atmosphere seems to be it for Desert Botanical - not just fries you can get any place - or option for a side salad - I never order fries so I would not get that sandwich.  We will go back - love the Gardens and the idea of the Gertrude's up front and open to the public but do feel they really need to be on top of the menu items to keep the locals coming - I have been in the Valley 37 years - we eat out a lot and there are a lot of places to eat that compete with this one.  They have location and decor and patio going for them, now knock me out with the menu.  Good luck to them - the concept and location are fab - we will be back and thank you for doing this in south Scottsdale's development area.  We live in Old town and love to eat in our area.

Instead, we were warmly welcomed by clearly exhausted staff. We sat on the patio in the most grand weather with a view of Chihuly's yucca or whatever that tall cacti is off the main entrance/cafe patio. Perfect location.   We had to ask for water, flatware, and napkins but it was the 11th hour, and our server, Bradley, was more than accommodating and apologetic. He listened to us whine about our disagreementss on wine, then came back with a winner for both me AND my husband. Our \"swine\" was served in a jiffy. I didnt think twice after we had consumed it about our earlier disappointment that they had sold out of the \"natural chicken\" or that the swine wasn't piping hot.   I'd say for a 9 p.m. dinner while the cafe was shutting down, it was a charming, and quite, delicious experience. All in all, I would definitely slip onto this patio (albeit at an earlier hour). I'm sure it is then worthy of 5 stars.   Side note: I met the owner last night at an event at the Phoenix Art Museum and she is an absolute doll. Can't wait to go back (the avocado gelato is on our bucket list)!",

When my wife and I arrived, we were greeted with a smile and taken to our table.  The server promptly came to the table took our wine order & talked to us about the new menu as well as told us some of his favorites; which we took his advice and ordered the Lollipop Kale (It was delicious!!!).   I love the wine list it has a little bit for everyone, I had a local producer Chateau Tumbleweed for my glass of white wine, I was pleasantly surprised on how good it was (I am not a huge AZ wine fan yet).  On recommendations from our server I ordered the braised pork cheek & my wife the scallops. Both dishes came out promptly after our appetizers were finished and cleared. The flavor and tenderness of the braised pork cheek was incredible it was my wife loved her scallops, which just from looking at you could tell the chef knew what they were doing perfectly seared and not overcooked in the center!!  For the dinner wines, my wife ordered a lovely Oregon Pinot Noir from Left Coast Cellars (she said it paired perfectly) & I had an amazing Washington Cabernet Sauvignon from Powers Winery!!  We finished the dinner with the doughnut holes which are amazing, three sauces all of which tasted great with the doughnut holes.  The service for the entire evening was outstanding.  I can say that as I for years in fine dining, they were well dressed, attentive, knew the menus inside and out and had wonderful recommendations.  Overall a perfect fall evening in Phoenix!!!",

The hostess said to please seat ourselves at the bar or we could get a table. It was 3 pm and the patio was nearly empty so we sat at a table off near the edge. A very kind waiter quickly took our drink order. Shortly thereafter the female manager came over to chastise us for apparently choosing the one table of nearly 20 empty tables that was presumably reserved in precisely one hour. By far the rudest manager I've ever encountered considering part of their job is being nice and customer satisfaction. We are adults and felt like naughty children without a clue what we did wrong. We quickly drank our one beer and left. Would not consider going back to try the food. No idea why such a beautiful establishment hired such a wicked manager. It was our first and last visit.",

I told her she just made my Mother's day!  We were not disappointed!...the ambiance was perfect!

When asked to describe the dishes our waiter made us feel dumb and said things like, \"what do you want to know?\" He then left out details like, it's deep fried. As a side note the Koren BBQ chicken thighs were awful, unless you like under done tempura battered chicken with bland Brussels sprouts. We went for my mom's birthday and although I noted it in my reservation the waiter couldn't even be bothered to say happy birthday. The food was mediocre at best, but I was honestly even more disappointed in the service. Had the hostess bothered to ask how everything was on our way out, I would have gladly told her, but she didn't. I even called as a follow up to let them know what a poor experience it was because I was really bothered about it and the manager told me she would be have been happy to go into the kitchen herself to make me something I would be happy with if I had only said something earlier. Lady I was trying to not be obnoxious since we were celebrating and I thought certainly when I mentioned to our waiter that I never would have ordered that dish had I known it was going to be breaded and fried, he said he would make a note for next time because that did seems important. What a total loss. I wouldn't recommend this for lunch. Maybe they do drinks and appetizers better. I wish I had read your reviews first, would have saved me from a bad meal for $150...yes, $150 with no alcoholic beverages and 3 entrees plus 2 kids meals.

    "text": "This afternoon, my parents and I came to Gertrude's for snacks and drinks. We ordered Bread, which was homemade and hard on the inside and outside. It was served with sweet tea butter with black Hawaiian sea salt. The Cream of Mushroom soup was rich and creamy and garnished with three pickled or caramelized oyster mushrooms.   For drinks, I'd recommend the Cactus Cosmo, which consisted of house infused prickly pear vodka, blood orange liqueur, prickly pear syrup, fresh lime, and cranberry juice. It was garnished with a lime wedge. However, both the white sangria and red sangria were worth $8. Both of the sangrias were garnished with grapefruit, orange, and pear. Each glass had half a glass of wine over rocks.",

I really don't understand how this place has a 4 point something rating - how am I to trust Yelp if people don't their pallets? The simplest of things... medium rare steak... how can one mess that up? They not only gave us a fully red centered steak the first time... they didn't even offer to give us a new steak... they offered to re-cook it though... HAAHH! But, we went along with it... sure. 5 mins laters... STEAK STILL UNCOOKED EVEN WHEN CHOPPED UP TO PIECES.... It was still completely red in the middle. Like they really just chopped it up, seared again one the outside to make it seem like they cooked it again, and then gave us some more of the sides... to make 9t seem like they made an effort... this calls for an LOL. Next, let's talk about this \"simple greens salad\" that is not simple at all. Trying to complicate the salad with a horrible dressing that made the salad all soggy and disgusting... like I would have been happy with olive oil, lemon juice, and some salt n pepper at this point... we never ate the salads, never ate the steak and server didn't even ask if we wanted to pack the rest up to go! Hahaha... probably was scared of our answer... one thing I hate about eating out is the possibility of not enjoying my food... I bet you guys Chef Ramsay would have shut thr place down by now...",

Once we were seated, our waitress came over within minutes and took our drink orders. We perused the menu and made our choices pretty quickly. Everything was pretty tasty, and made the way it was ordered.  The ambiance and vibe here is what really gives it the edge. With a view of the gardens from pretty much any seat, locally sourced food / drinks, and neat decor it really has a great feel.  The dessert was the only real disappointing part of the meal. It had an odd flavor to it and I wasn't overly thrilled with it. Wouldn't order it again if we were to go back anytime soon.  Overall: A A must-do if you go to the gardens.",

Cons: Slow service - there were maybe 5 tables on the patio and 3 servers and it took quite a long time to get food.  Mediocre drinks - Their Sangria was $9 and was a pretty small wine glass...with mostly ice and fruit.  Mediocre food - The food sounded great on the menu...and it was ok...but not for the price. Flat Iron Steak for $27...wasn't bad...but it wasn't \"$27 good\" either.  I think expectations would have been tempered a bit more if the price was lower or the quality was higher. However, high priced...\"B- food\" never leaves a great taste in your mouth.   I'm not an angry Yelper...but I was a bit underwhelmed for the price and just want other people to have tempered expectations. Wonderful atmosphere though. Love the Botantical Gardens!",

I am glad I had a reservation because I doubt we would have been able to be seated as a walk-in since so many people had attended the luminaria event this evening.  We were seated promptly. The menu had all sorts of appetizing items with a wide range of proteins and a few vegetarian options. I had the venison and tried some of the Korean fried chicken. The venison was superb, full of flavor and I loved the slight kick of spiciness from the ancho chile rub. It was cooked perfectly at medium rare, and very tender. It was served with roasted potatoes, creamed greens, and a date puree. The roasted potatoes were perfect, and while I enjoyed the taste of the creamed greens they were served in a rectangular brick form so it made me think they had served me a frozen box of spinach on a plate. The date puree had good flavor but I didn't like the grainy texture of it. The presentation was unique. It reminded me a little of the mountains along Papago Peak. I also tried some of the Korean fried chicken which had a wonderfully crispy skin and tender meat. There were some pieces that were slightly over seasoned though and a bit too salty for my tastes though.  Service was good and we were checked up on as needed.  We finished our meal with a lovely panna cotta with berry sauce and diced dragonfruit. I loved the creamy panna cotta with the texture of the dragon fruit and tangy addition of berry sauce. The orange peel on top was a good way to make the presentation look better, but the actual taste of it was tough and leathery. If it had more of a candied flavor it would have perfected the dessert.  Overall it was a fine meal and a good way to spend our evening in conjunction with the luminarias event.",

Second star is for their house potato chips, which I thought was quite fantastic. Third is for the wine that we ordered, which also turned out pretty great. Sadly, I didn't find any other redeeming qualities here.   Our server seemed to either be having a terrible day or he is in the wrong profession. We asked for water while we looked at the menu. He came back and slammed the glasses on the table, which alarmed us a little bit. We decided to get a bottle of the Jules Taylor Sauvignon Blanc. This was a pretty great bottle and undid some of the unpleasantness from the service. I ordered Huevos Rancheros and asked that my eggs be scrambled instead of fried. But of course, it came out with fried eggs. The food itself was okay.. not terrible but I wasn't jumping up and down in delight either. The fingerling potatoes it came with were lackluster and under seasoned. There is so much you can do with breakfast potatoes!  It's time for another round of training for some members of the wait staff. Overall, it was an underwhelming experience. Meh!",

For this visit we where celebrating my birthday and to attend the 2017 Las Noches de las Luminarias. We made reservations for 4 but the Flu threw a wrench into our plans. So last minute changes where bring down the festivities. We were running late but called ahead and Gertrude was accommodating. Our server made our night with his gesture of dessert and great service. Thank you Gertrude's for making my Birthday and our New New Year so memorable!",

Unfortunately today, the front desk person told us there were no table available outside because of 40 more lunch reservations (it was 1 pm), in spite of them all being empty and a table readily available on opentable outside. It seemed he purposefully tried to not accommodate us.  Given that this is a pretty pricey place for lunch with mediocre food, with lots of other good options in the area, I found this attitude so annoying that we ended up leaving. I don't think I will come back to this place.",

I had the Red Blend, Pillsbury, \"Wild Child Red.   It was an enjoyable wine.  For dinner I had the Sonoran Style Fried Rice with the Pickled Mushrooms + Chinese Broccoli + Black Garlic Mojo + Chili Rubbed Poached Egg.   Others had the Korean Fried Chicken Thighs, the Striped Marlin, two had the Gertie Burger, and another had the Smoked Pork Pozole as well as the Roasted Veggies and the brussel sprouts.     I don't know what they mean by pickled mushrooms, but the dish was absolutely delish!   Everything had the correct amount of flavors and textures albeit the chinese broccoli could probably have been fried a tad less.   The egg was a great touch.     Everyone said their food was great.   I tried the roasted veggies as well as the brussel sprouts, which I believe were roasted as well.   I liked the roasted veggies, and even though I'm not that much of a fan of brussel sprouts, they were good.   I thought the chips that accompanied the burgers had waaayyyy too much salt.   It seemed as though someone accidently spilled the salt shaker.   Since they weren't my chips, I have nothing to complain about.  I would definitely go back to Gertrude's just for the food.   The setting is perfect sitting outside and the servers were very attentive, friendly, and professional.",

Mom and I both had French toast and sausage.  We should have split our orders!  The plate of French toast was enormous, both of us only ate half.  It was possibly the best French toast I've ever had!  Served with slivered almonds and just a bit of syrup - which was enough, the French toast was moist but not soggy.  The side of sausage was four large sausage links (which again, neither of us finished).  They boxed out French toast and sausage up for us to take home and we enjoyed breakfast again the next day.    Hubby had steak and eggs - steak was cooked to his request and he said it was very tasty with only the tiniest piece of fat on it.  We all had cocktails before brunch, the best one of the bunch was the Sangria.    Service was a bit slow at first, but once we ordered, food was delivered quickly and they checked on us often.",

Also learned that Gertrude's was a farm to plate place, using ingredients fresh from the farms around Arizona.   I swear I only went to try the lemonade, but I am a sucker for eggs benedict so when I saw them on the brunch menu I knew I had to try them! By the way, the berry lemonade, it's pretty amazing, even if you are someone who does not like lemons, or lemonade (like me) take my word on this, you will love it! It was lemonade, fresh herbs and fresh berries, and it was perfect and refreshing!  Gertie's Benedicts was a visually beautiful dish, English muffin , house-made Canadian bacon, spinach, poaches eggs drizzled with hollandaise sauce served with fingerling potatoes, and this dish tasted as good as it looked! Fresh and delish!  We also ordered a bowl of fresh fruit & coconut mint syrup, this too was great tasting!  This was a great find and glad I had the chance to try them out!",

But the patio is great in cooler weather and the location at Desert Botanical Garden is superb.  The emphasis is on locally grown fresh ingredients, and the dishes are quite creative and in our experience excellent.  This morning my wife had the pastry special which was a lemon fig scone.  It was very tasty, light and fluffy texture, no crumbs left on the plate.  I had the egg dish special which was a quiche that had quinoa as an ingredient as well as a bean.  It was also excellent.  This is also one of the few places where you can get prickly pear iced tea, which is another great local taste.   The prices were moderate, and no more than going to Good Egg for example.  We looked at the dinner menu and will be back for dinner some night as the offerings seem to be unique pairing unusual ingredients.",

    "text": "Gertrude's has a lot of potential, but it just misses the mark for me. It's located in the botanical garden, but you certainly don't need a membership to eat there. It has seating inside, a bar and patio seating. It was incredibly busy when we arrived, so we chose to sit at the bar.  I ordered the Niman Ranch Burger with a Big Blue Van Beer. The niman burger, while it was still good, didn't live up to the ingredients. I didn't taste any of the house 1000 dressing and smoked cheddar was nonexistent. But the burger was still a good burger. Meat and the sesame bun were great, it just needed toppings that had flavor.  If you're curious what a blueberry beer taste like, then give big blue van a shot. It is sweet, but not overly sweet and quite refreshing for a hot Phoenix day.   Service was great. The bartender taking our order was really friendly, offered us recommendations, and we chatted about big blue van beer.  Like I said, Gertrude has some real potential.",

Besides the longer-than-expected wait times for food and food items never arriving, what did end up in front of me was UN-BELIEVABLE!   I'm a vegetarian with a long history of being underwhelmed by veggie sandwiches. In fact, you'll rarely catch me ordering one because of the blandness that so often accompanies the traditional \"salad-on-a-sandwich\" that is usually served to me. I decided to go against my gut and order the veggie sandwich and was so happy I did. What ended up in my belly was the most flavorful, rich sandwich I've ever tasted. It was amazing that they could cram so much flavor into this thing. It was truly amazing.   Along with my sandwich I also ordered their Cactus Cooler adult beverage. Absolut Pears, ginger syrup and muddled serrano peppers... yes, peppers! Let me just say, that drink burned so good.   All in all I will definitely be back!",

Don't listen to your GPS or iphone! With no signs, and not ever previously having been to the gardens, there was no clear way to get there or know where to park.  The interior is simple and casual, but the menu is excellent with very unique, tasty, local dishes! There is a great private room located on the kitchen that is quiet, intimate, and gives you a direct view of all the action in the kitchen which is a really awesome feature.",

    "text": "One of the best ways to see how a business is run is when things go wrong. It's easy to be great when everything is right, but when there's a snag, it's too easy for things to fall apart. The last visit I made to Gertrude's gave me a great picture of the way the staff makes sure things stay right. Three of us went in Easter morning for a snack. None of us were hungry enough for a full meal, but wanted something. We each had the fresh lemonade with herbs and berries (I am not generally a fan of lemonade, but this was fantastic), and decided to share the special of hot cross buns with cinnamon butter and the garden frittata. The room is casual and comfortable, with a fantastic patio. The food was fresh, well prepared and beautifully presented. Our server was attentive and had a great personality. I thought the prices were high for the quantity served, but much like resort dining, you are paying for the location. I wanted to treat the gals to our snack, so I slipped the server my debit card. All was well until he brought the check. It wasn't the card receipt for me to sign, it was the check. I reminded him about my card, he acknowledged and walked away. A few minutes later, the manager came over. It seems my card was misplaced. She gave me her business card, apologized, comped the bill and was taking down my contact information when the server came back - having found my card. Naturally, I was relieved. I was also surprised and impressed that they still insisted on not charging us for the meal.  With how promptly and professionally it was handled, and the great customer service that was shown - in addition to the fact I thoroughly enjoyed all I ate and drank while there - I will definitely be back - probably every time I go to the Garden!",

We were so excited to have found a place to go for a wonderful bite & a walk around the Botanical Gardens (which is quite a nice way to spend a free day) ...move ahead 4 months...we bring my parents (visiting from Vermont) to experience this wonderful place & see the beautiful gardens...lunch was average, definitely far less than we expected...the mussels were too busy,  mussels speak for themselves, they didn't need all the ham...Chili was average & sadly the BLT was less than impressive & finally the red wine was very warm... we chalked it up to just bad luck...forward to February & we were determined to find that same experience that caplivated us when we had the tartar... & we decided to venture out again (with the kiddos) and see the lights at night at the Botanical Gardens ...we had to make reservations & that took my husband several days because, believe it or not there was no answer on Wednesday, called on Thursday & after a few trys was finally able to get a reservation on the patio...they must be booked because there was VERY limited space available, seemed strange that most dining room tables were open when we arrived at 7:00...beautiful patio spot...server was exceptionally sweet. ..we thought we were in good hands but that quickly changed...our drinks took quite a while, ok, we can get over that...we selected our entrees & wanted to start with that fabulous salmon tartar...we wanted to order a bottle of wine but our entrees arrived...she didn't space out our appetizer of smoked salmon & said it was  a  mistake & was  being served with our main course, we declined the appetizer (total Bogart, we wanted the salmon with our martinis)...we ordered a GLASS of wine each but that didn't arrive until we were half way done with a disappointing meal...tuna was Medium although ordered xtra rare...the Duck tasted like a tough turkey thigh with no flavor...& the $17 burger was only adequate... the worst part was that no one seemed to care, we voiced our opinion to the server & had to request a manager, he didn't seem happy about our displeasure & said he was sending out desserts, we didn't want dessert, we wanted a good dinner, he walked away saying he would take care of it...we waited quite a while not knowing what was being done & my husband finally went to the host stand to resolve the issue...enough said, they took care of the meal we DID NOT enjoy & at the request of my husband gave us a certificate for dinner for 2 so that we could return...that may seem great but we wanted to enjoy & pay for THAT dinner..we have a yearly membership so we'll be coming here a lot but unfortunaty we will have to dine elsewhere...such a wonder place as the Botanical Gardens should have a much better restaurant to represent them...these people need to learn about customer service & the dining experience...food on a plate does not make an evening,...I gave the 2 stars for the beautiful outdoor seating!  Try the smoked salmon tartar!  ...",

Don't assume anything about the dishes, your previous experience with something with a similar name and ask about seasonings, ingredients.  I shared a cheese plate with a friend and then had stuffed pasta shells.  I experienced an overload of vinegar between the two dishes, the stuffing in the pasta shells was bland, unseasoned.  The pea puree covering added color but there was little flavor and the dish was exceedingly disappointing.  I'd go back to the garden but not the restaurant.",

The wait staff was definitely much more friendly.   The food took a long time to bring out. We were surprised at how small the portions were given the prices. I ordered a $25 king salmon and it looked like it had to be a really small square piece (maybe 3 oz or at least it looked like that). The taste? Just meh.   I had also shared with my girlfriend a fish taco plate. I thought the fish was ok but again, an expensive dish for what it was for... 2 or 3 tacos with barely anything in it... We had a group with us who had the french toast and the hot mess. No one was impressed. It was all just a typical meh-fest. The only reason why we thought it was a good idea was that it was next to the Botanical Gardens.   This place tries hard to impress but in the end, it was just disappointing.",

    "text": "This is a wonderful place to enjoy a fabulous meal and experience the beauty of the Desert Botanical Garden--a Phoenix treasure, in my opinion. The menu has much variety and offers many dishes prepared with locally sourced fresh products. The cornmeal calamari appetizer is a creative combination of flavorful breaded calamari, red onion, and sweet peppers on a bed of delicious fresh dressed greens. It was seriously top-shelf, generous in size, and so tasty. The beet salad was another highlight with tender fresh beets, tangy maple vinaigrette, goat cheese, hazelnuts, and excellent garden-fresh lettuces. I ordered the large size and ate every savory bite.   Our server was personable and helpful, as was the manager on duty. Since it was a hot day, we ate inside the dining room this time, but very much look forward to visiting again when it's cool enough to eat outside on the lovely patio. I'm excited to return and try something off the appealing cocktail menu and the dessert menu. It looks like they have some nice happy hour deals also.   I agree with another reviewer who hopes more diners bypass the local chain restaurants and support fantastic, independent places like Gertrude's where the chefs truly support and source local food providers and businesses in the creation of their dishes.",

The duck was tough and difficult to chew, the cassoulet was bland, oh and the steak knives were so unbelievably dull we could barely cut through the baked potato let alone the steaks.

We tried the calamari appetizer and enjoyed it. We have had calamari a few different ways and this was a new one but it was good.

At that time our server took our food orders.  25 minutes later he came over and told us that due to a computer glitch, our food order did not get entered, but he would process it promptly.   Another 25 minutes later, we were served.    We were bored and very hungry by this time.  The server announced that the food order would be discounted 50% because of the wait.  Two of the party were several bites into their hamburgers before they realized they'd been served each other's sandwiches and exchanged dishes.  The server came by when we were about half through eating, and asked how things were.  I said fine, but for a strip of bacon in my sandwich that was raw (truly, it was raw).  The server left and had a very visible conference with a woman whom we took to be the manager, during which time they kept looking over at us.  A few minutes later, the woman came over and shoved a plate of crisp bacon onto the table at my left elbow.  She did not introduce herself, but said apparently there was some complaint about the bacon and pointed out that the bacon was served the way most customers want it. Her manner was blunt and rude, without a word of apology for the long wait.    At that point two of our party checked their sandwiches and found their bacon to be cooked, and found it curious, if the prevailing preference is undercooked (raw).  I would forgive all and try this place again one day, but for the rudeness of the woman, who was not in any sort of uniform, but appeared to be in charge.",

I got the veggie ($12) which was packed with fresh vegetables, and some kid of wonderful cheese that brought the whole together. It was very good.  The person I went with got the chicken and bacon sandwich ($14), she said it was very good and that the bacon was cooked to perfection.  The fries were, well... fries.  The dinner entrees were pretty pricey, they were $20-30, but it is good fresh food.  They also have a good selection of wine and beer with local options for both, but the local options were rather pricey.   The wait staff was friendly, attentive and helpful. They made sure we were taken care of with out being too involved which allowed us to converse and enjoy our meal.   The atmosphere is casual but nice, makes for a great date place. From there you can go right into the garden and complete a nice trip to the garden.",

    "text": "We loved our evening in the Desert Botanical Garden! Beautiful place, even better with the Light Show that evening. We made a reservation at Gertrude's for 7:45, the earliest we could get for such a busy evening. We were seated on time, outside as we requested. Our waitress was very good and pleasant. The setting was just lovely. Unfortunately, they had run out of bread, and we were very hungry by 8:00 PM. When our entrees arrived, we were disappointed with the portions. For $34, I had 3 scallops served on a corn-tomato relish. That was it. My husband had the duck dish, and he had a little more on his plate than I did. He had ordered the potato soup as an appetizer, and it was delicious. We each had a glass of wine. With the tip, we spent over $100. The scallops were not hot, and I hoped they were cooked enough. Someone at the next table sent her dish back because it wasn't hot.  So........I would have to hesitate before recommending Gertrude's. Perhaps lunch or brunch would be a better choice.",

    "text": "Great location in the botanical garden. Saw someone order the Arizona Benedict and was sold. It was tasty and the chorizo made the dish. However was a little sloppy looking compared to what I saw my neighbor get. My friend ordered the same thing and one of her eggs was over cooked. I would come back though to try the dinner.",

The Mussels were cooked perfectly and the added Bloody Mary sauce was slurp worthy. Looking forward to returning and sampling other items from the menu.",
