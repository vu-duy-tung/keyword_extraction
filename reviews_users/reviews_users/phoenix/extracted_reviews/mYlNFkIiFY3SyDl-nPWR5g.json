Part of the charm is that Nick is such a lovely man. And this is evident when you meet the staff- it is clear that they love their working here. Everyone guest who comes in is treated like an old friend, which is probably why we all keep coming back.  5 stars is not enough~",

I figured it would be more of a low-key type place, but it was really nice inside and the food was FANTASTIC.   The only complaint I have is that every time someone opened the front door (which was frequent; the place was PACKED) it was absolutely freezing, but the restaurant was able to move us to an area away from the door and the problem was solved!   I started with a glass of Riesling, as usual. I was happy that it was only $5 per glass versus the normal $8, and I was not disappointed with the taste. The busser immediately brought us waters and bread with dipping oil. I could have eaten it all day!!!   I opted for something not even on the menu: Penne pasta with pink sauce (combo of white and red). It was ABSOLUTELY Delicious!!!   The service was great, and I love that our waiter even had an accent!   Overall, I really enjoyed Nicks and will be back for sure!",

    "text": "I just realized that I have never wrote an actual review on Nick's, my favorite Phoenix spot. Maybe it's the nostalgia? I've been coming here since High School. Maybe it's the casual, family owned atmosphere? No matter which location you visit, you'll most likely see Nick checking up on things. Most importantly, it's the consistency. No matter which location you choose, it all tastes great, every time.   For me, this is good Italian food, but in the American way. If you're looking for real Italy italian, you may choose another spot, but I find the typical Lasagna, Ravioli, Baked Zitti to be fantastic! I love their Bolognese, and if you notice on my profile, my last meal on earth would be their chicken parmesan with a side of spaghetti bolognese- each entree comes with a huge side of either fresh veggies or pasta. The portions are huge, so I love to eat some, and it's always even better the next day! Here are a few of my favorite dishes:    -Di Mare Salad (with grilled calamari like Gabi M says) - Tilapia Picatta - Chicken Ravioli (my best friend Natalie always tells me that if you get     the Chicken tortellini, you actually get more!) -Chicken Parm (note the above) -Baked Ziti (have them add meatballs) -Cannoli (I'm pretty sure I could spoon feed the filling like ice cream! Was that too much?)   Go to any one of their locations for a casual, quick Italian meal- I'm never disappointed!",

    "text": "I have recently become addicted to checking reviews to new places to eat before I head out & based on other reviews was pretty optimistic about trying Nick's.  My boyfriend and I got there for an early dinner (around 5ish) and were seated very promptly.  The decor was simple and classy, fresh flowers and cool colors filled the room. The server was prompt and rehearsed spiel-less, which I always find to be a plus.  The busser was quick to refill beverages before half empty and offer more of the delicious bread once we had finished the original.  The bread is a highlight, there were two options, one a common french loaf type and the other a lighter, beautifully seasoned variety.  To dip your bread in there was a nice seasoned olive oil.    The food took a fairly decent amount of time to arrive considering there were only 6 or so tables, plus the happy hour crowd at the bar top.  Perhaps they were understaffed in the kitchen, who knows, I didn't dock them any stars for that.  The thing that got me to click 3 vs. 4 stars however was the fettuccine alfredo.  The plate arrived to the table and I had dreams of what I was about to dig into (beautiful memories of the sadly closed Pasta Pomedoro came to mind)  However, these dreams were not realized.  The noodles, although lovely and wider fettuccine type, were over cooked and verging on mushy.  And the sauce, while it smelled lovely, lacked any sort of mouthwatering goodness.  We also shared the pizza, which was a fabulous price, but nothing to write home about.  Although we left Nick's not planning to come back as soon as we can, I think based on other reviews that perhaps we just did not find their star dishes, and for the price (2 sodas, pizza, and pasta for $26) I will most likely be willing to give this place a try again.  And after all, I did not have an opportunity to try their tiramisu, (how I truly give Italian eateries the thumbs up or the boot) so I will have to make sure to try that next time...",

    "text": "I'd like to be able to review the food but my experience at Nick's was so horrendous that I can barely remembered what I ordered.  I went during happy hour, when I typically go. It's very small and always tough to find a seat, especially when the bar tender reserves the last spot for his girlfriend who hasn't showed yet. After I had to shuffle seats 3 times I waited for the bartender to finish his conversation with his girl, who finally showed, to ask for a drink. He clearly couldn't be bothered with getting my drink order, bread, dinner order, parmesan or refills for my friend soda, I was never asked if I wanted another drink ... I guess he really wanted to spend time with his girl. My friend had the same difficulty. Every single portion of the service had to be asked for, not one thing was ever offered. I felt invisible. We decide not to leave a tip, which I can't remember the last time I've done that. Imagine my surprise when the bartender came outside after us as we left the restaurant. He asked if everything was OK? \"No, the serve was sub par and that's why we left no tip\". He told us never to come back, turned around and went inside. After thinking about it, I decided that was unwarranted and went back into the restaurant. I was surprised how calm I was after his behavior. \"Not only was your service substandard, but you're very rude. You're right, I'll never come back again\" His behavior escalated and he actually threatened to call the police which I thought was kind of funny because I was pretty calm. \"Really? Great, I'll stand here and wait, call the police.\" I'm still wondering what he would have told them. What an ass.",

Started with blue cheese wedge - average at best only a couple red onion slices and two tomato slices - no cucumber no bacon, no crotons.  Other order was eggplant with pasta it was again average at best - egg plant was paper thin not recommended. The other dinners were chicken parmigiana  and veal  were  better choices but still subpar dishes--, they are really cutting corners with quality ---maybe there trying to attract tourists but not locals- I give over under in 2 years..   As I checked in I received a 20% off for one entree and the waitress had to take my phone and track down the manager to verify my $4.00 discount- LOL--How funny and very unprofessional is that- chasing the manager through the kitchen with my personal phone thinking I was trying to get over for $4.00--unreal!! Just think average plate is 25 plus if I was worried about money I would of chosen a chain restaurant ( Olive Garden is a better choice and quality is better) try  Michelinas, Guidos, or Giuseppe , Maggianos , Tutti Santi by Nina's , North Restaurants all in Scottsdale /North Phoenix are all close by.  I've eaten here before and this establishment is going downhill- there are many better choices than Nicks - and I will never return--don't waste your money or time!!   The  good news was the waitress Toni was attentive and polite but so are most professionals. I don't think that the company has long term plans .",

Last night, we ordered the grilled vegetables and fried calamari as appetizers. The calamari was very fresh and perfectly fried. The sauce was a bit spicy, but really complimented the flavor well. The grilled vegetables were perfect! My only complaint was an abundance of carrots. We wished they would have added additional eggplant and zucchini.   As a main dish, I ordered chicken florentine without mushrooms. The flavor was great! I loved the garlic and cream sauce. I wish they had additional spinach, but will certainly order again.  The restaurant is small. It is always busy, and last night was no exception. The service was spot on. Orlando goes above and beyond and has a great attitude.",

I had cioppino and it was a lot of pasta, a few shrimp a few small mussels and little else, not worth the price. Cobb salad was great and another chicken entree looked good. My downgrade is because of their happy hour policy, only available at the bar and you can not transfer your bill to the table. If you are going to have a happy hour, make it customer friendly. There is no difference in a pour at the bar or a pour at the table. A general feeling about waitstaff and bar staff is that although they are prompt, the attitudes are surly and don't seem too happy about being there.  With the bar tab confusion and attitude, the tip dropped to 15%. I would not go there again since there are a lot more strip mall type restaurants that have better food and more welcoming service, not to mention better cioppino. Next time try Roma Gardens.",

This place is easily overlooked and deservedly so.   The food: subpar. The free bread they bring you when you sit down is cold, flavorless, and a total waste of stomach space. This would be even more of an offense if the entrees were worthy of stomach space. The dinner salad ($5) is extremely simple- green lettuce with maybe a teaspoon of balsamic with some sliced cucumber and sliced Roma tomato around the plate. The entrees my company and I have ordered are the gnocchi with pink sauce, fettuccine Alfredo, and chicken spinach tortellini. All a waste of stomach space. You have to ask the waiter about which pastas are homemade. The menu says they are all homemade but only the fettuccine, linguini, and gnocchi are homemade.   The iced tea tonight was rancid. Even our waitron recognized that something was seriously wrong. He didn't charge us for them which was appropriate.   The service: standard. Enough said.   Skip dessert. Skip this place altogether.   Hopefully some day I'll find a nice neighborhood Italian place to go to. This isn't it. Twice was enough- won't be returning.",

There is a reason why she seemed to have many regulars at coming in and out.   Was offered bread immediately upon sitting, but declined-- did hear others in the restaurant raving.   Food was good. Had the calamari with linguini in white wine sauce. The calamari was tender and well cooked (grilled) linguini was cooked to perfectly. I likely would have tried the red wine sauce next time-- the white wine sauce was \"lacking\" something. I'm a \"bigger\" guy and the serving size was MORE than enough and they didn't skimp on the calamari.   Salad was fresh and the right size. Oil and vinegar was seasoned well. Add blue cheese crumbles to the salad, it is worth it.   Chianti was good, liquor was strong selection for a smaller bar set up.   Food price was below what I would have guessed. Wine was a little pricier -- scotch (Oban) at 14$ a pour is a bit much ($55-60 a bottle)  Quiet restaurant...",

    "text": "We frequently travel to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and often find ourselves at Nick's to get some Italian food to take back to the hotel (it's only a short distance from where we stay). This particular Nick's is near the intersection of N Tatum and E Shea. It's on the small side and dimly lit, but provides a nice, intimate atmosphere. There is some bar seating, which is great if you're just looking to grab a couple drinks there and dinner to go.  The food has been hit and miss for me. Their lasagna is fantastic, as are some of their other dishes. That said, the last time we went I was very disappointed with their calamari fettuccine (I got it with the white sauce). Given that the sauce was being paired with seafood, I expected a light, but flavorful sauce. Although light, this sauce was far from flavorful. It was essentially a bland, light cream sauce--no garlic, wine, or any other hint of flavor to be found. The calamari itself was tender enough, but overall, I was not very satisfied with the dish.  The service can be hot and cold as well. A couple trips ago, we came in about half an hour before closing, and we were constantly reminded that the kitchen would be closing soon and we needed to hurry up and make up our minds. This past time, we sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely charming and attentive. It just depends on the day you catch them, I guess.  We may stop into Nick's again in the future, but given our mix of experiences, we'll be trying out some new Italian places in the area to see if we can find a new regular place to grab dinner.",

    "text": "This is a nice little neighborhood restaurant, good, but not great.  I've been here a couple times since I live close and have found the food to be well flavored, service quick, and drinks strong ;)  My personal recommendation is the penne alla campagna, a great mixture of pasta, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and chicken in an olive oil based sauce.  Not too heavy, not too light.  I was a little disappointed they only had peach sangria, a nice red one would have hit the spot.  They also have a gluten-free menu.  The staff is very attentive and take a lot of pride in their restaurant, but like a few other Yelpers have noticed, they seem to want to get you out quick.  Our server asked us twice if he wanted us to box up our dinner while we were clearly eating.  I don't want to be rushed on a nice dinner.  For a few more $ and because it's across the street, I have to recommend Rusconi's.  Their service and food is really 5-star.",

My husband had a lemon chicken dish with gnocchi on the side.  I did not like the pink sauce on the gnocchi one bit and when I tried his chicken I didn't taste lemon, I tasted wine.  Yuck.  I like that they make their own pasta but they really need better sauces to go with it.  Very limited indoor seating as well, and when it's 108 degrees, sitting outside is NOT appealing.",

The gluten-free menu, however, is extensive and the dishes are very good. The staff are always friendly and attentive.   Tonight my companion had the crab ravioli and said it was delicious! I had Pasta Pollaio. Both were delicious! Although we came in about half an hour before close, staff were completely professional and friendly.

The Eggplant Parmesan has some AMAZING sauce with it unlike any I've had before. A lot of red sauces all taste somewhat similar but this is something special.  Both times I've come home with leftovers so portions are on the larger size. Complimentary bread and oil starts your meal off. Service has always been spot on.  My only major gripe about the place is the seating and size of the place. Be warned... this location is SMALL. Both times I went I ended up with ass in my face when someone sat next to me was leaving.",

Shrimp Emperial, $18.95, Shrimp was clearly frozen too long and tainted the whole watery, bland dish with bad fish smell. Baked Ziti, $10.95, watery, bland, have had better from a can. Biggest disappointment... Antipasto Misto, $10.95 for Oscar Meyer and Rubbery Caprese.

They were very busy when we got there and it took us 45 minutes just to order!  That  and the lack of flavor in the tiramusu were the only reasons I gave it 4 stars, not 5.  Our server was very friendly and provided great service once it calmed down.  We split a large salad(Spinach Walnut) to start, which was delicious!  I had the shrimp scampi dish with linguini and it was great.  Super garlicky(which I LOVE) and the shrimp were huge!  I will definitely be back to try Nick's again.",

However, on my next visit my friend and I tried to enjoy dinner. We were asked to sit at a smaller table outside vs. a larger table for bigger parties. Ok but when some people came in that were repeat customers and they sat at the table we wanted but there were only two, well that was somewhat rude.  Then the waiter catered to their order and needs over ours. Such as when he did bring our food and asked us if we wanted parmesan cheese. We said yes. He then went to the kitchen and retrieved the food for his favorite customers and then brought the cheese for them and then brought it to us. Maybe they are big tippers but as someone that was looking to be a regular I may have been too.  The food was good but for gluten free they really do not have many choices. I have been going to another restaurant in the area and they have excellent choices with better service. Unless I am dragged here again I most likely will not return for their food.",

    "text": "The good first.  I ordered the crab ravioli and the hubs ordered a wedge salad.  Both meals were delicious.  They brought out a basket of various breads including garlic knots.  That was a definite plus, I love variety not to mention the offerings were delectable.  I also ordered a tiramisu to-go.  The tiramisu was okay.  I prefer it with chocolate liqueur sauce but they use cocoa powder as a garnish instead.    Now the bad.  The wait.  I understand they were moderately busy and the place is quite small but waiting for 15 minutes after receiving our drinks just to order is a bit on the ridiculous side.  If they were staffed properly this would not be an issue as I saw only one server running around the entire restaurant and she was quite rushed with everything.  They really should have a backup server during busy times.  Or at the very least have who I suspected was the bartender help out rather than stand around and watch the dining room.    One thing that I found humorously interesting is when the server took my drink order.  I ordered a Mr. Pibb after seeing it on the website's menu.  She comes back with the hubs drink but quickly tells me that they don't have Mr. Pibb and hands me the beer menu asking me to choose another drink.  I quickly ordered a root beer instead which she hastily obliged.  The hubs and I couldn't help but giggle that she didn't realize that Mr. Pibb is a soda, not a beer.    So in conclusion, the food is good but they need to be staffed properly.",

All I can say is that I wish this place was right around the corner from me. It was SO GOOD!!! I could totally become a regular at this place. It's nothing but high points folks:  1. Authenticity - the waiters are actually, get this, ITALIAN! 2. Service - fast and friendly, which is impressive for such a popular place. 3. Beverages - good selection of affordable wines and specialty drinks. The house Pinot Grigio was great. 4. Seating - though it's small inside and by the looks of it, very popular, we walked in and were seated immediately without a reservation.  5. Food - 5 stars! FANTASTIC! The bread that comes when you are seated is delish (and a generous selection of a few different breads). We started with the yummy antipasto salad - fresh and delicious. It could only by topped by the entrees - each meal was so good and was a decent portion - Shrimp Scampi, Baked Ziti and Butternut Squash Ravioli (my fave). Though definitely full, I couldn't resist dessert and ordered a cannoli. Oh...my...gosh... delicious. Such a fantastic meal.   I hope that business or other travel brings me back again.",

    "text": "I read all the hype on this place and was hoping for some great food and instead left wishing we had just eaten fast food.   I tried the old staple of chicken parmesan as it seemed a popular choice and I will never go there again.  It tasted like a frozen chicken patty with canned tomato sauce.  It came with spaghetti on the side and that too was not only overcooked, but just gross.  My girlfriend had the gnocchi with pink sauce and again it underwhelmed.  I know finding good gnocchi is difficult but to me, the sauce again fell flat.  It all tasted store bought and out of cans or jars.  When I go out somewhere I want to eat something that I can't fix at home myself.  Not only could I have made it but I could have made it MUCH better.  The only redeeming thing I liked about the food was the bread at the start.    As for the ambience, it is small and had a quiet feel to it but looking around, all the artwork (most of) are pictures you buy from Target...And there wasnt much other decor around to give you that Italian feel to it other than the waiter's accent which to me seemed very over the top whether he is authentic or not.  Sometimes I couldn't even understand him.   Either way, for the price I know you can get better Italian food.  Try Cucina Tagliani.  I felt Nick's was overpriced, underwhelming, and not worth me ever going back.  It wasn't the worst food in the world but it wasn't anything memorable by any means.",

I ordered the Linguine with eggplant and chicken, when they brought it out, it was a very small dish and I thought they made a mistake giving me the lunch portion, but they said no it was a dinner portion.  very very small portion and I was still hungry afterwards.  Also they do not make their cheesecake in house they buy in from someplace else and it was over 50 ingredients in which are all genetically modified.  Cheesecake can be made simply with 4 or less ingredients... The food is just average at this location.  There are many other Italian places in town which are far better.",

The restaurant itself it small yet warm and inviting. Snag a booth in the back and enjoy the view of the entire restaurant while sipping some wine and eating delicious pasta! Once you sit down you are immediately greeted with warm and soft bread and olive oil; try not to spoil your dinner but it is hard not to. There are lots of great meals to choose from on the menu, but I highly suggest their pizza which has a unique flavor and the perfect amount of fresh cheese and whatever toppings you desire. I also suggest the baked ziti with the cream sauce...actually anything with the cream sauce you cannot go wrong. If you like ravioli you have to try it, the ricotta cheese is quite possibly the best I have ever had. The pasta is fresh and flavorful, the sauces are perfect and they make your food however you want it. Their salads are also very good.   I have not had the chance to get to Nick's at happy hour, but they have great drink and food deals at the bar if that's your cup of tea. They also have good takeout service which is perfect for those nights you want a good meal but in the comfort of your own home.   The only knock I have on this place is that due to its small size they have limited staff sometimes and the service can be a little slow....buuuuut relax, enjoy a drink, the ambiance, and have a nice night!",

The alfredo is a little too gravy-like for my taste, but if you like that style you'll love it. The chicken was seasoned well. The ravioli was the most disappointing... just about 7- one bite little guys and nothing else. They were soaked in an \"ok\" butter sauce that was just too greasy. They did send the complimentary bread and it was delicious. I thought that was a nice touch despite our entrees. Will most likely try again.",

    "text": "\"The Killer Salad\" - literally!  If there is one thing I hesitate posting here is a one star review.  That said, we've been enjoying take-out from Nicks for a long time, and the food choices we have in Phoenix/Paradise Valley have been so poor that getting Italian food is either Nicks or Olive Garden!  I always get the Veal Cutlet Parm with a side of spaghetti and it is stellar.  Thursday evening my wife got a take away order of a Caesar Salad and Pasta with butter sauce.  There were other items and the family shared everything except the Caesar that my wife ate by herself.  The salad actually didn't have romaine lettuce and seemed to be only chopped up iceberg lettuce.  Within an hour of eating, she exhibited eight of ten common symptoms for :  Abdominal Pain and Cramps below the ribs but above the pelvis Diarrhea Generally Feeling Sick Chills, Body Sweating and \"Clamminess\" (most people actually run a low-grade fever, but she did not) Weakness and Fatigue (she could not even walk easily)  I put her to bed, got her plenty of fluids, chewable Gas-X, Pepto, Imodium Multi-Symptom and Zantac.  She slept for 8 hours and began feeling better.  The next day I contacted the restaurant, asked to speak with a manager and was told to call back at 5:15.  I explained the situation fully and said that in this case, although we have enjoyed Nicks for many years, it's evident that the lettuce in the salad was bad and my wife received a food-borne illness and I expected a call back from the manager.   Not a single call back; I decided not to attempt to chase the manager down again.  Clearly, our situation was not a priority, so I am posting an updated review.  The only reason that this is not a one star review is that we have enjoyed years of wonderful food there.  A great reference on food-borne illness is here: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Ffood-poisoning%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20356230&s=50a23d93f79ae38c5110cc0469eab71096b7911b55f3ebc983e43996f8a18d6c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mayoclinic.org/diseases-...</a>  Another reference on the current status of the Yuma romaine lettuce issue is here: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Ffood%2Frecallsoutbreaksemergencies%2Foutbreaks%2Fucm604254.htm&s=57a053e60dc8b2a07fa916d9c8bd855de6f328fba60b4f6078d2c6381b8afafc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">fda.gov/food/recallsoutb...</a>",

I'm not sure what happened here if it was a rush issue to time with a fish plate and three pasta dishes but man the middle of my small pie was soup.  Yep, like, not just floppy, foldable NY style.  Like...have to scoop the gelatinous mess onto your fork just to eat it like the insides of a calzone.  What was an extra shame was that the exterior crust around the edge was pretty darn good!  Ugh.

After we ate the waitress came over asked how everything was, didn't remove the dirty dishes or even asked if we were done. The busser came and cleared the plates and there we sat for 15 min. Finally waitress came over and asked about dessert, hesitant we ordered and also asked for our check fearing we would be there longer...and so we waited for our check after dessert for an additional 15 min. Watching I think this was isolated to this one server not the others, the other servers seem to be very attentive and moved with purpose.",

Specifically, I was looking for osso buco, a favorite of my husband.  I called restaurants from my work in Scottsdale to my home in Mesa w no luck.  One had it on their menu at almost $40 but way too expensive for me.  I found it on Nick's menu and ordered the whole dinner from them.  Yum!!  My husband was thrilled that I had done this for him.  Bonus was getting grilled shrimp app, caprese, osso buco w risotto, veal picatta w pasta (delish), and 3 desserts (had to get one for my son!), all for $105.  In Scottsdale!!",

At first we ordered Fried Calamari and Caesar Salad, the taste was pretty okay, nothing special to it. I always ordered Lasagna everytime I go to an Italian Restaurant, so That's what I did here. I was thrilled when I got my order because it smells so good and the apperance was very appetizing as well.To my surprse, when I had my first taste, it was a little bit salty.I tried the other part however it was the same.

We ordered spinach and chicken tortellini, chicken Alfredo, capers and cheesy garlic bread. Let me say this was the best decision I made all week. Everything was amazing. Pasta was fresh and def tasted homemade. The pink sauce was delicious and Alfredo sauce had a perfect garlic flavor. I can't wait to visit the restaurant and eat in. It's my new fav Italian spot. I do think it was a tiny bit pricey but not too bad. This is a good find. I'll be a regular because I love Italian and it's not always easy to find.",

I have to admit that it's always looked on the more expensive side from appearance-sake but when we finally opted in, the price was incredibly reasonable! Most of the pastas and bread are handmade in the restaurant and well worth the extra calories. My favorites thus far are the chicken fettuccini with alfredo sauce and chicken and spinach tortellini in a rose sauce. The tiramisu is also massive!  The staff is super friendly and checked in every time my glass got below 1/4 full. They were also helpful when making recommendations.",

I walked in and was greeted and seated very quickly.....drink order very fast. Service was top notch...every time my ice tea got nearly drained...it was picked up...any questions answered...  This place should really be a rated a $$$....my entree was $15 my girl's was $16 and her glass of wine was $9...mix that with salads...it came out to $57...  So....with that much cash this alfredo must be outstanding right? Not even close....it was greasy and had lots of garlic, was not creamy and in my opinion didn't even taste like alfredo should....even olive gardens alfredo is better...Brios' sauce slaps it in the mouth! XD  I ordered a side of the alfredo as my entree came with \"pink\" sauce.....which was a mix of red and white....they should have left the red alone...  I also like my bread warm....this was not....oh well  If the service had not been good...I would have knocked another star off.  First visit...and most likely the last.",

Nick's doesn't. The ambiance is very clean, crisp and bright. Nothing like the dark cellar feeling of other restaurants. Music was golden oldies, the right volume so as not to distract. I started out with a Manhattan while my wife had an ice tea. She donated blood and didn't want to drink alcohol. The drinks should have arrived at the  same time as we wanted to toast our anniversary, but I had to wait a couple of minutes more for my cocktail. No problem. Bread arrived first than our drinks. We started out splitting a garden salad with blue cheese dressing. They served it on separate plates with the correct amount of dressing. All items were fresh and ripe. The dressing had chunks of blue cheese which was wonderful. It reminds me of home made. My wife had salmon piccata while I had veal piccata. She rated her meal 5 out of 5. I did not taste it because I don't particularly care for salmon. My veal piccata which came with a side it pasta were both drenched in the most delicious sauce I have ever tasted. The veal was so tender I believe I could slice it with my fork. We did not have dessert because we were stuffed. The next time I will request a table closer to the back because my eyes are sensitive to the brightness coming through the windows. I would also request customers with small children be seated as far away as possible. A couple came in with two small boys and were seated next to up. For the most pare the boys were well behaved. But a couple of times, we'll you know the rest. I love veal piccata and will return to Nick's. I will get the marinara sauce on my pasta on a separate plate.",

Still we ordered, we came this far. Caesar salad for two; Baked Ziti with Meatballs for him, Pasta Arrabbiata for me. In both cases, the pasta was soggy, even though one was baked and the other pre-boiled. Sauce on both was far too salty. We just wanted to get out and go home, but our server left, or so it seemed. There is nothing worse when you just want to Pay, but no one will help you.  Our next experience, 18 months later, we decided to order a pizza to go :) We called in the order, the person taking the order said it would be 15 minutes. Note the time: 15 minutes. I won't go into the grisly details. We didn't get the pizza for 90 minutes.  90 minutes!  Unfortunately, we paid in advance. Does it take 90 minutes to make a pizza at home?   Haven't gone back, and hope this review helps you. (We reviewed this restaurant before and it was removed.)",

The server (I didn't see his name) was so nice and friendly, he is the reason why I give this place 4 stars. He asked my bf and I if we would like to have some wine, I don't drink alcohol or wine and it'd be so sad if my bf drinks alone? Lol  We ordered somekind of a Mozzarella stick for the appetizer, I was really excited about this one but when the food came, it was only 4 small pieces and it served with a bowl of Marinara sauce. It was actually pretty good, I just wish they gave more, lol.  My bf ordered Chicken Alfredo and I ordered Cheese Ravioli. To be honest, I tried the chicken alfredo and I really didn't like it! There was a weird strong taste to it that I can't explain but my bf liked it, so it's probably just me.  My Cheese Ravioli was good. I have no complain about it!  Maybe I'll come back again next time and try other food!",

The reason for coming here regularly was their consistency in both food and experience, until lately.. For some reason, the female waitresses and hostesses are not friendly, attentive, or have manners. The last three times, we did not even receive a thank you for coming. However, the male bus boy was all smiles and made up for it. That should not be the case. Every employee in an establishment should make an effort to welcome each guest and make them feel at ease. I will sadly not be returning after the last few times dining in. I hope this review finds its way to management for future improvements.",

There was no ricotta cheese in it, only mozzarella on top melted (perhaps that's what qualifies as baked ziti now). The sauce tasted like pizza sauce (no chunks, just tomato puree).  I guess next time I should get the calzone.",

My boyfriend who doesn't eat red meat, took a huge bite out of it, only to realize there was meat and spit it out. He said it was disgusting. After a manager responding to this review stated that they don't even offer meatless lasagna, it makes me wonder what they teach their servers and waitstaff since we were directed to \"try it out\".  The Fettuccine noodles tasted either raw or over cooked, I couldn't tell, and I wasn't about to eat more to find out. I realize the noodles are homemade, and normally have a different texture than say, store bought noodles. They were not made or cooked properly. The sauce had little to no flavor, so we couldn't even resort to dipping our bread in it.   Aside from wasting money on this meal and not having dinner last night, I'll also add that we've been sick for 12 hours with possible food poisoning. As soon as we ate from here, within 30 minutes we became very ill.   I would not recommend anyone going here, ever.",

I had the Cioppino which was good but I should have followed my first thought of not getting the Arrabiata sauce since it listed it as spicy. It was way way too spicy to the point I ate about 1/4 of it before having to stop and ending up throwing it away.

It's small and intimate, the food is consistently good; my husband is always impressed with how fresh the fish and seafood is - we do live in the desert. He grew up on the east coast, lots of good Italian and fresh seafood so the fact that they make him happy says something.  Service is always good, Orlando always knows who we are and takes good care of us. There was a time in the past where service was lacking, and it was something they were aware of which is why they had a \"now hiring servers\" sign up. Shortly after, they had some new people about the place and service was back on point.  I've never had a dish I didn't like here, and I'm the kind of person who likes to try all the menu has to offer; sometimes seafood, sometimes chicken, sometimes veggie - ravioli, linguini etc... It's all good. A favorite of mine is the farfalle salmon, it's a repeat on occasion.  Check out Nick's!",

The items that are great, are great enough to keep coming back. First of all, ANYTHING in the white wine garlic sauce is practically orgasm inducing! Especially the Penne a la Campagna! Penne pasta, chicken, spinach, mushrooms, and sun-dried tomatoes combined with the white wine garlic sauce make for a fantastic combination. The marinara sauce is very tasty, conidering it seems to be very basic. The Cioppino in the WWG sauce is probably my second favorite thing. It seemed like an overwhelming avalanche of multiple sea creatures; Shrimp, clams, mussels and calamari. all over a huge portion of linguini. I also highly reccomend the baked ziti with sausage... Its hot!!!   Nick's has a great little dinning room. Small, but intimate. Its mildly reminiscent of some of the little restaurants in San Francisco or New York that i've been to. The service is very hit or miss. It seems like the female staff is much more enjoyable, not because of their gender, but because it seems like they know HOW to be friendly and efficient. Most of the servers at Nick's seem to be overworked, as they always rushing and and sometimes it takes longer then it should to be greeted. While there is one male server whos section i refuse to sit in, most of the other servers do a great job.",

Tried some lasagna which was good. The best item was the pizza which was similar to Red Devils pizza. Service was fast and the plates were scolding hot which was perfect for me. Price was just right for the portions just wish everything tasted as good as the pizza.",

    "text": "Well, reading these reviews it seems like there are 2 totally separate Nick's in the same place! We went, the first time, on a groupon, we had the seafood linguini with white garlic sauce and I thought I was in Italy or Sicily.  It was amazing, tasted home made and real!   Service.... Well it seemed the \"other servers\" were taking better care of their customers than ours.   To get 5 stars all has to be fabulous! 2nd time, wonderful food (I ordered the same thing, just can't get over how good that was) and the service was worse, including mistakes on the bill.   Nick is a great host and, when I get to know him better, I might talk about the friendly, but sub par service.  Something is just miss there. The place is crowded which attests to the excellent food.  In my NSH opinion, this is real Italian!  How you can compare Olive Garden to ANY real Italian place is beyond me.  Obviously, you belong in Olive Garden if that is your \"standard\" that you compare Italian food to.  I'll take Nicks!   Now I want the cannoli.... After reading about them here!  I've never been to happy hour, but my son says it's pretty good as well.",

Anyway I might be exaggerating but this place is really good. It can be a little spendy but I find that the portion sizes are generous. My dish is the baked ziti with bolognese sauce & that runs about $12, I can eat the whole thing in one sitting but I do sometimes force myself to stop and take half of it home. The menu is HUGE though, I just stick to what I like. The atmosphere is nice, better for small groups rather than large but I think they can be accomodated when necessary. I've wanted to sit at the bar but haven't done it yet. Nice patio as well. It is in a strip mall next to a beauty supply store but what's new in this town? Highly recommended!",

We had my son's graduation party here, and planned the menu from the menu pricing listed on the menu, which was done with the catering person, and then when the bill arrived it was a whole different price. Nick, the owner, changed all the pricing, without asking, charging us double for the food we ordered and would not change or correct the pricing. WOW, what a rip-off. How would you like to pay double just to do your party here? I think NOT!!!",

They serve very reasonably priced glasses of wine (and full bar).  Overall, it was a great meal, with fairly large portions.... The lack of a final star was because of the burnt coffee.......",

We were given a taste of bruschetta, which was a nice touch, and our salads arrived which were very fresh and very large! My husband ordered the veal chop and grilled vegetables and I ordered chicken breast with cheese, tomatoes garlic...sorry cannot remember the a tubal name of the dish.  My husbands veal chop was perfectly cooked and swimming in a cream, red onion sauce which was delicious!  WAY TOO MUCH SAUCE. The vegetables were perfect and served on the side. Now if you are looking for a dish that is beautifully presented, and garnished in an appealing way....this is not the place.  The great thing about not garnishing is that the food comes out HOT and looks like it is home cooked...a very good upside.  As for my chicken.......disappointing, very bland. A few Italian herbs added at home the next day perked it right up!  The manager said that he found it lacking in flavor too. HHMMMmmmmmm why doesn't he talk to the chef about that? WE WILL GO BACK...best veal chop in town according to my husband.",

But with that being said, when I do get a sudden craving for Italian, Nick's is my number one choice.  I really like the quaint atmosphere....but it is the food that keeps me coming back.  I hadn't been to Nick's in probably over a year, but it is by my parent's house, so we went for a quick dinner the other night.  They always have really enticing specials, like Seafood Risotto or Manicotti.  The menu is HUGE, spanning from pasta, to filled pastas , chicken and veal dishes and even pizza.  They make a good pizza, and I especially adore their gnocchi in the vodka sauce, but my favorite thing to get is the Chicken Parmesan.  This version is not breaded at all; it is just sauteed and then topped with an amazing red sauce and mozzarella cheese.  It is not what you would expect, but it is delicious!  You get your choice of either a side of pasta or vegetables, I usually get the sauteed veggies because they are so good; a nice combination of broccoli, cauliflower, squash and carrots.  They are cooked perfect and even better when dipped in the extra sauce.  Oh, I almost forgot, they also give you this delicious focaccia bread and olive oil for dipping when you sit down, it is so fresh it just melts in your mouth!  So if you are willing to pass on the all you can eat salad at the Olive Garden....you should give Nick's a try!",

We both enjoyed the pasta dishes we ordered (with plenty for left overs the next day). Our server was very good, she was attentive but not overbearing. The restaurant was small so tables were a little close together, but we sat in a corner so it wasn't too bad. The only thing we didn't really like was the mozzarella carrozza- it tasted like someone deep fried a grilled cheese mozzarella sandwich, not much flavor. Overall, a nice neighborhood restaurant. Leftovers were still delicious when reheated. :)",

The pasta was fresh, the ravioli were satisfactorily stuffed, and the cream sauce was tomatoey.   The service was excellent, I really hate it when waiters hover.

    "text": "I really like eateries that are high-energy and bustling, especially ones that have their dining area set up as one big room. So it is with Nick's Italian in Paradise Valley (there are two more locations in the Valley). The upbeat, high-energy restaurant makes you sort of feel like you're in someone's home, since the seating quarters are close.  The food is all handmade, and I really enjoyed my meal, too. My pal and I grabbed a seat at one of the bar high-top tables, and we started off with the Caprese salad ($7.95). It wasn't huge of anything, but the mozarella was high-quality, the tomatoes were juicy, and the basil was ample.  For my entree, I got the Portobello Mushroom Ravioli ($15.95). The pasta was filled with delicious mushrooms, which I really enjoyed. I liked the pink sauce the ravioli was served with, but I wish it would have had fresh tomatoes in it. Also, I felt like the portion could have been a little more generous.  Here is my pal's Veal Parmesan ($17.95), which he said was pretty darn awesome because the veal was tender and the sauce was tasty.  The meal-ender, the tiramisu ($6), was a great deal, really delicious and perfect to share. The mascarpone cream was mouth-watering, and the ladyfingers melted in my mouth. Tiramisu is my favorite dessert, and that was definitely my favorite part of the meal.  While I enjoyed Nick's Italian, and I did appreciate the twinkly lit patio, I would choose Arrivederci over Nick's if you're in the area, based on the service alone. We were in a busy area near the bar, but servers should still strive to make you feel welcomed and relaxed no matter how buzzy the place is, and I didn't really get that vibe from our server. If you do go, try to get a table in the main dining area or patio-maybe things would feel a little more welcoming.",

I don't think you'll be disappointed if you're looking for standard Italian fare, but it's the kind of stuff you can make yourself pretty easily at home.  We kinda pigged out here, as we bought the $20 for $40 Groupon; I got a calzone, the lady got a pizza, and we shared a plate of gnocchi. Again, it all was good but not spectacular or anything. As dumb as it sounds, I wish they had a Groupon option of $20 for $10 or something; if you're only eating for two, $40 of food is a lot of food here. If you don't have the Groupon, you're still paying about $20 for two entrees, so either it's pay that or gorge with the $40 Groupon- kinda lose-lose (but not really, because we're fat Americans).  Anyway, waiter was great and the atmosphere's all right- dark-lit Italian restaurant and all'a that. Everything seemed clean, et cetera.",

This area is full of chains and I came up empty with suggestions when my friends and I decided to meet up for an Italian dinner.    Inside: Small and cozy.  I really enjoyed the ambiance.  It's nothing fancy, but it's also not too laid back- dimly lit with tables snuggled in close to each other.  Great date place.   The Food: I had spaghetti with Alfredo, mushroom, chicken, and I believe one other ingredient that I can't recall.  It was pretty tasty.  Not my favorite all time pasta dish, but definitely worth getting again and better than plenty of places I've dined before.  Everyone seemed to be satisfied.    Bottom Line: If you are looking for Italian in this area, I can wholeheartedly recommend Nick's... at least over Olive Garden.  Also, I was the first to arrive and the bar was a welcome place to wait and have a glass of wine.  Not bad Nick, not bad!",

I walked in and really liked how the place was decorated.  Its not a huge resturant, but has a more fancy feel to it.  Not a place I would walk into with jeans on.  Classy enough to put on a nice outfit for a great experience.  (Im normally not a fancy diner, but for dates, I tend to turn it up a notch.)  I was impressed with the service that I had here.  Menu is loaded with just about any and every dish you could imagine. I like variety, and this place had it.  Our meal started off with a bread basket and some dipping oil which I liked a lot.  Server got our drinks and we took our time reviewin the menu.  I went with the Lasanga.  I think my date had the chicken parm.  Servings were nice and big!  Tasty too!  It was funny, because even though the service was great, the service was kinda funny.  Date took notice and we had a good laugh about it.  I was taking my time with my lasgana, and the server kept asking me all the time if I was done. I kept telling him \"no, I'm just a slow eater.\" Then, he would come back like 5 minutes later and ask the same thing again.  rinse, wash, repeat for the last half hour of the date.  Plus, the mexican bus boy literally stood table side to refill my beverage after I took more then 2 sips.  It was actually hysterical!  Date and I had a great chuckle over this!  Anyways, I really enjoyed my experience at Nicks.  I guess they have several valley locations, and I plan on returning.   Great place for dates, parents, or just something nice!",

    "text": "My friend Joan was going to meet me at Nourish123 in Scottsdale on Monday, but luckily, we both noticed that it's closed on Monday so we ended up meeting at Nick's at Tatum and Shea.  We go where we have groupons, etc. and she had one to try it out.  I can honestly say that I was quite happy and surprised when I showed up first and saw a sign outside of the restaurant which said they were featuring a gluten free pizza for less than $10!  I was all set to just have a salad but this changed my mind.........since I figured an Italian place would have great pizza!  I entered the restaurant and saw that I had arrived first so the Host greeted me and I told her I was meeting a friend.  She said that she'd bring her over when she got there and seated me.  She asked what I wanted to drink and left to get my Iced Tea.  She came back with the Tea and a bowl of bread, which I asked her to remove until Joan showed up.......too hard to look at something I love and can't have!  Then she informs me that they closed at 2:00 p..m.  I really don't understand why she failed to mention this to me when I sat down!  We might have decided to dine elsewhere....and before I ordered a $3 Iced Tea.  It wouldn't have bothered me to order a $3 Iced Tea if it were good but it tasted like Lipton Tea which had been in the canister for a week............you know, when it tastes like tin?  So Joan arrived and we decided to eat anyway........and I ordered the GF pizza with tomato slices, mushrooms and onion.  Joan got a bowl of soup and salad.  We chatted and waited for our food.  The pizza looked pretty decent with lots of mushrooms and veggies present but upon tasting it I was immediately aware of no spice taste.  It tasted like they opened a can of tomato sauce and poured it on the pizza.   Between the pizza and the Iced Tea and them not letting us know that they closed in half an hour, I'd have to say that I would never go back or recommend the place.  When we didn't have a large enough order to even make using the groupon worth while, Joan asked for a dessert to go...and was told that there was nobody present to even prepare it, sorry!  Yeah.  I'll never go back!  That's ridiculous!",

    "text": "Italy! It survived 30 years of domination under the corrupt Borgia family, Mussolini, wars, murder and bloodshed. But they've also produced the some of the greatest art and music in the world. And food. You know there's nothing like Italian food. The wide variety and nuances from the various regions offer something for everyone. If you think it's all watery, overly sweet red sauce, you've been ruined by cans of Chef Boyardee and jars of awful Ragu.   Nick's restaurants have been a staple on the Valley restaurant scene for nearly 20 years, developing a loyal and devoted following. So much so, that he has three successful restaurants. Nick made his livelihood as a hair stylist in the Big Apple. Tired of the winters, he emigrated from New York City to Phoenix. Disappointed with Italian fare he found, he borrowed his family's recipes from his brother and opened his own restaurant. Nick's is warm, casual, intimate and inviting. And delicious, of course.   \"I want you walk through my door and enjoy every minute you're here 'til you leave,\" Nick hopes.   We visited Nick's Paradise Valley location, starting off with his amazing Bruschetta. Fresh bread, baked on the premises every morning, topped with tomatoes, olives, basic, garlic, capers, onions and herbs. Only $5. Other appetizer choices include grilled or fried calamari, mussels in red or white sauce, grilled shrimp and others. Nine fabulous salads are also available as well as Minestrone and Stracciatella soup.   You wanna talk pasta? Nick's pasta is all housemade. All 16 varieties, with everything from Angel Hair to Ziti. Whole wheat and/or gluten free are both available from $10 for the Marinara to $19 for the succulent Lobster Ravioli. Nick creates his sauces in small batches every day or two for freshness and maximum flavor.   Eight different chicken dishes grace the menu. Each is served with a side of pasta or steamed vegetables. The Chicken Marsala ($16) is the most popular. The Chicken Parmesan is a traditional, solid choice. A generous, pounded breast covered with Nick's irresistible, bold, thick Marinara sauce, Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses and baked. If you like, you can have it a la Milanese--dredged in flour for a light coating, flash fried and then baked.   In the mood for \"frutti di mare\"? Nick's extensive seafood entrees with eleven choices give you plenty. Our recommendation: you get a little bit of everything with the heavenly Cioppino. Originating in San Francisco, this now \"traditional\" Italian dish includes tender mussels, chopped clams, calamari and shrimp served over linguini, not necessarily as the stew you might usually expect. Suggestion: Try Nick's Cioppino with Garlic White Wine Sauce to experience the most delicate flavors of the seafood, although you can also get it with the spicy arrabbiata sauce or with marina sauce. $21. The calamari pleased us with its perfect tenderness and sweet flavor. Hard, rubbery calamari is always a looming threat for even accomplished chefs. No worries here.   Feel daring? Nick offers five different veal dishes. We can't wait to try his his Ossobuco, a Milanese specialty of braised veal shanks. (Shhh! We won't tell if you won't!)  Nick also has specialty and create-your-own pizza and calzones.  For a real treat, finish the meal with one of Nick's large Chocolate Chip Cannoli. It's even better if you're being served by Nick's young cousin, the handsome and built, built, built Jason. He can make me an offer I can't refuse anytime.   For a great value, try Nick's Lunch Specials with a wide variety of choices, including Hero sandwiches. This menu is available Monday-Friday, 11 a.m.-2 p.m.  You'll never forget the time you spend at Nick's.",

I am a New Yorker born and raised, and have been out in AZ since 99, longing for a good Italian restaurant that reminds me of home... This place is it!! I moved into this area of PV in January and have been to Nick's on Tatum more than a handful of times. I can honestly say, they are consistently GREAT! Their homemade pastas are out of this world. And you gotta try their Bolognese... AMAZING. End of story! Hands down the best, most underrated, Italian joint in AZ. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I know this review sounds like I'm laying it on thick, but good food is something New Yorkers take for granted. Annnd, out in AZ, it can be hard to find, especially a place that serves great Italian. Service is great for dine-in or take out. They don't skimp on the portions either. Go to Nick's if you want to enjoy a great Italian meal... they do NOT disappoint. Trust me. Oh, and you're welcome. :)",

When the waiter was told about this all he said was that he was sorry!  The salads were just thrown on a plate.  Nothing great!  The waiter seemed uninterested in our table when he realized only one of us was ordering alcohol.  This place in general was a real disappointment!  We won't be back!

We were very pleased with the service from our Host/Waiter: Orlando and the entire staff.  I have to RAVE about my dish, the linguini seafood cioppino with garlic wine sauce and their homemade tiramisu!  IF you LOVE seafood you MUST order this, for $20 I was extremely impressed with the Quantity and Quality.  It comes with jumbo tiger prawn shrimp and muscles in a 1/2 shell, I want to say there were about (4) each and an ABUNDANCE of clams and tender squid. It was so wonderfully balanced with the seafood and the light garlicky wine sauce I was in heaven and enjoying every bite.  There was so much of it that I only ate half and had the other for another serving the next night.  Their tiramisu is very smooth and is perfection.  I loved this smaller restaurant, the decor, food and the customer service is great!   Other patrons were enjoying themselves and their food. It was nice to see the variety of dishes being served and the happy faces that enjoyed the flavors and the same Host: Orlando.  I was reluctant in trying this place due to the average reviews on Yelp were MEH, but I am so happy I finally tried this grand place. It's now my new favorite place aside from Ocean Trail at Talking Stick.  I will be back 100% and awaiting for a great deal to come by since I also passed that up too when it was offered on Groupon.    Thank you Nick's and Staff for a perfect dining experience! :)",

Probably pasta was boiled in pot that had been used to cook seafood. Penne dish I ordered was flavorless-and watery also. Only reason I gave them 2 stars is Caesar salads were very good. They are off my list for good. If we were dining in we would have sent the dishes back. There are too many better ITALIAN restaurants in this town for anyone to waste their money at Nicks.",

    "text": "If you are looking for a casual restaurant for lunch or dinner and you're in the mood for Italian food, Nick's at Paradise Valley (in the Whole Foods shopping center) is an excellent choice!  Whether you're in the mood for pasta, pizza, soup, salad, fish, chicken, or veal, you can find something that you'll be happy with at Nick's.  I've been on several occasions and never been disappointed.  They always start you off with fresh bread and olive oil (a must for any good Italian restaurant)... don't allow yourself to eat the whole basket though; you must save room for what is coming!  Some of my fave things to order are: -Grilled calamari appetizer (yes, I said grilled!)  -Grilled eggplant appetizer -Stracciatella soup -all of their salads are delicious -pasta with meatballs  -salmon or tilapia (picatta style) -Shrimp Fra Diavolo  I don't think you can go wrong with so many options to choose from!  Portion sizes are generous but not ridiculous.  I recommend saving a little bit of room for the Hazelnut Tartufo for dessert... it's the perfect sweet ending to your meal (and it helps to cover up that garlic breath you probably have from your dinner)!  FYI:  There is waiter service at this location - and the menu is a little different than that at their other Scottsdale locations.  Nick's won't blow you away, but it's a safe bet for a simple Italian meal with consistent service.  Take it for what it is... Buon appetito!",

This is a very small place (which I will harp on) so there is absolutely no way to miss anyone who has been seated.   1) Sat and waited for water ( busser looked at us and walked by half a dozen times and never brought any) 2) Completely ignored by the server(3 tables and 1 booth had people).  This place is small enough to be able to talk to anyone from where you are sitting, so there is no way to miss someone has been seated. 3) Finally came over to get our drink order which by this time we knew what we wanted and we're ready to order (by the way, you get bread w/ 2 small plates for the oil and pepper) 4) Didn't take our food order, just the drink order.  Our menus were down and any server worth their money would have known we were ready to order 5) Took way too long to get our drinks - Ice Tea for cripes sake 6) Once the drinks came he wanted to know if we needed any time to look over the menu - really?! 7) Food took so long we were wondering if they were rolling out the dough, waiting for it to rise, roll out again so they could make the noodles 8) Heaven forbid you want a refill on your drink, which we had to get his attention for 9) Checked on us one time 10) Our dirty dishes sat on the table, he or the busser never took the dishes away to make room for our meals, so we had to  squeeze room for him to put down our meal plates.  He didn't want to take them from me 11) Finally  came over and we asked for to-go containers, which took so long to get we were wondering if someone had to run out and buy them 12) Food in the containers, we sit and wait and wait and wait for our bill.  You would think we had ordered something complicated.  A chicken alfredo for my son and a salad for me.  The only reason we stayed is because he likes the food and he was taking his mother to dinner.  The server was so busy talking with the other guy that working wasn't something he or the busser knew how to do.  They are 20 feet away, I'm  trying get his attention, he keeps looking at me and nada.  We had 2 other parties come in 15 minutes after us, get taken care of and were done with their food and out the door before we could get a refill on drinks.  I prefer not to go here because this is not the first time I have had to go with family and had such horrible service, but my son likes the food.  I would suggest doing carryout so you don't have to tip the server for such pathetic service. Told my son I'm not going back here, period.  Really, this place is so small that someone sitting at one of the high top tables in 'bar' would be able to talk to people on the opposite wall.  Busser and server has to walk past every table to get around.  The worst service I have ever had anywhere.  We'd come here to get food and some service, if I had known that I was supposed to get up and do his job, I would have. We always tip on service and I didn't want to leave this guy a dime, he didn't earn it, but my son left him something anyway.  This should have been 45 minutes tops for dinner, but lasted 1.5 hours.  I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone for dining in. For us this is a neighborhood restaurant, only 1mile down the street.  I've waited a few days to write this review because I was so disgusted at the disrespectful service.",

My shrimp scampi was also extremely salty. The noodles were almost uncooked.  Very disappointed.  My friend spoke so highly",

    "text": "It's like I have to psych myself up to go to Nick's every time, because I forget how much I love it but last night, I had to personally thank the owner for serving quality food at a fair price (you can get a glass of wine for $7 and an entree for $13-$15)... it's a bonus that it is close to home! So, even though, for some reason, I keep forgetting that I actually REALLY LIKE the food here, I'm a BIG fan of Nick's. I especially recommend the arrabiata, the gnocchi, and the stracciatella.",

They execute a halibut dish that is both easy on the palate and light on the calorie counter. Their bread is among the best.  Truly great Italian American food.",
