I really wanted to love this place but the only thing to love is the patio and the sweet, albeit late servers. My friend D's veggie quesadila came...it was microwaveably uninteresting. My steak dish -Carne Del Fuego I think, never came, and when I asked to cancel it, it was brought out and unfortunately prob the worst concoction of flavours I ever tasted. It was as if someone chewed some meat up in their mouth, spit it out on my plate and covered it in warm honey mustard. It was reminiscent of spaghettio's. Sorry Tortilla Factory, I really am...and if I didn't have such a headache I might wax more poetic about the atmosphere. Bottom line, order some wine and soak in the beautiful patio. That's at least worth a few stars.",

The nachos were very good (I hardly think heart healthy!), as well as their house \"treasure\" margarita (though on the pricey side--but work was paying, so I didn't really feel the $12 hit!).  I ordered the tacos and was somewhat disappointed when they came out fajita style--I wasn't interested in really \"working\" for my meal since I was with a large group of volunteers from work and was more focused on visiting.  But beyond that, they weren't half bad.  Much better than any Mexican food you can get in Ann Arbor, so I was happy.",

Other than that, food here is pretty gross. Very limited menu (with nothing you want, except maybe guac, 'cause the chips weren't even good) and pretty pricey for the dog food (\"beef\") you get. We had nachos as an app, and then actually chose to leave after that w/o doing entrees. Enough said. They did bring some jalapeno (?) flour tortillas and red pepper (?) compound butter as their version of a bread basket, but even this tasted somewhat off. Not bad, but for sure not worth the carbs. There are many great Mexican places in Scottsdale, so skip this one.",

We ordered the \"chef's favorites\" whatever that means.  I knew before I ordered that the food was going to suck when a \"Southwestern\" restaurant has salmon on the menu.

    "text": "Wow.  Some of these reviews absolutely floor me.  How can there be THIS much difference of opinion?  I just got back from a weeklong vacation with the family in Scottsdale, AZ and while looking for places to eat my wife had jotted down the \"Old Town Tortilla Factory\" on her pre-trip search.  She said the Food Network had them listed as some of the best Margaritas around.  So last Tuesday we stopped by for a few and some appetizers.  The kids ordered their non-alcholic cherry margaritas (on the kids menu) and some nachos. My wife, mother-in-law and I all ordered different Margaritas to compare.  We planned on getting the \"Million Dollar Margarita\" (well reviewed), but at $20 it just seemed steep.  But we were all raving about the Treasure Margarita.  Definately two thumbs up.  We also  some appetizers - \"Nachos Del Sol\" which is loaded with jalapenos, chorizo, pepperjack cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole and probably a few more things I can't remember. It had a kick to it, which I liked..... the small order was pretty well sized.  My wife & mother-in-law ordered the \"Plato Apertivo\" which was kind of like an appertizer sampler (ribs, Santa Fe rolls, nachos, quesadillas, etc).  They enjoyed that.   The Tortillas however, were OK.  they offer different kinds depending on what's the special of the day.  When we went it was Black Bean.  They were fresh and served with a dried tomato butter.  Interesting.    Overall we had a great experience.  Good, friendly & prompt service and it wasn't crowded at all.  So good in fact that we went back for dinner on Friday night.  This time we went light on appetizers and ordered full meals.  I have to absolutely RAVE about the \"Poblano de Mariscos\" - it was two nicely sized poblano peppers, roasted and stuffed with a crab, cheese, roasted corn, red pepper stuffing over rice with a shrimp cream sauce.  It was AWESOME.  As good as a similar dish I like to get in a small restaurant I like in Cabo San Lucas.  My wife ordered the Achiote Ribs and my mother-in-law got the Pork Chile Verde.  All seemed quite happy with it.  My sister-in-law got the Penne con Pollo which she quite liked. The kids on the other hand, got orders of Mac 'n Cheese.  Hey, they're kids.  Overall I really liked this place and would definately go back again the next time I visit Scottsdale.  It beats the ever underwhelming, overpriced Cheesecale Factory or similar chains.",

    "text": "As I walked in, I was reading some bad reviews on my blackberry.  But the joint was jumping, there were good-looking pople all around, and I had a good recommendation.  So I took a seat next to the flaming fountain on the patio, and absorbed the cool atmosphere.  I wasn't jazzed about the menu descriptions.  They all sounded dull:  grilled sea bass topped with shrimp over garlic mashed potatoes;  Grilled salmon with an apple glaze; various enchiladas; chicken with penne pasta.  I decided that a place called the tortilla factory has got to have good tacos, so I ordered the house tacos.  How could I go wrong?  I ordered chips and salsa, and the waiter brought some complimentary black bean tortillas with tomato butter.  I wolfed down one thick, leaden, undercooked flour tortilla and pushed the plate away.  Maybe the worst tortilla I've ever had!  The house tacos were just like the fajitas from any chain restaurant:  grilled chicken, steak, and shrimp with accompaniments: guacamole, beans, rice, and pico de gallo.  Shredded iceberg lettuce was the only vegetable.  Each individual item was quite bland.  It all could have used a squirt of lime juice, some cilantro, or even just salt and pepper.  The gilled chicken was as tough as could be.  And the plain flour tortillas were nothing special.   I picked at the steak and shrimp and left the chicken.  Then I made a huge blunder and ate a second black bean burrito.  As I write this review, I can feel this baseball-sized lump of dough in my stomach.     The atmosphere is cool, but the food stinks.  It reminded me of cafeteria food:  bland, overcooked, and not really fresh.",

Three of us ordered tacos and one ordered green Chile pork. The green Chile pork was a bowl of watery soup with a tiny bit of finely shredded pork and a whole bunch of potatoes! The tortillas served on the side tasted homemade but the tortillas that came with the taco meals were dollar store tortillas. The meat was good--chicken, shrimp and beef, but no cheese with the tacos, only black beans and rice. The guacamole we ordered was ok but it was $13. Two at our table had beer, one had a glass of wine and I had a soft drink. The bill was a total shock. $114 for four awful meals. The service was poor too. Nice but not at all attentive. We all could have had a far tastier meal at any other Mexican restaurant for a fraction of the price. I guess they are really proud of their ambience.",

Food is where I was a little disappointed. 10$ for chips and Guac is a little much even though the Guac is fresh and delicious. I got the filet medium and it was medium well borderline well done and dry for a filet. A filet should stand alone without needing additional sauce, this one did not. The corn on the cob I realize is grilled but it was very dry. Inedible. Potato mash was good not great.  THE DESSERT! Wow! The chocolate cake was so good! Must try!",

    "text": "Last week I bought a deal on Living Social. It included an appetizer to share, two entrees, and a dessert to share. Oh, and four margaritas. It was a good deal, needless to say. We decided to redeem our voucher on a Friday night. I called to make a reservation, and was told they don't make reservations for parties less than 6, but to come in and they would seat us. No big deal. We got there a little after 8.  We asked for a table outside, sat down, and I ran to the restroom. By the time I got back, we still didn't have a server. We sat there for nearly 10 minutes before I was going to say something. Then, finally,our server came over. He was nice, and took our drink order. I told him about the Living Social, and all night he proved to know little about it. He even mentioned that this was his first one. That's fine, the voucher hadn't been out long... But if an establishment is going to run a deal like that, the entire staff needs to be aware of it before greeting tables. As you can see in other reviews here on Yelp and other networks, the voucher has been redeemed several times already.  We ordered our first round of margaritas. Sheryl asked for frozen. When he came back, hers was not frozen. Our server corrected the issue, but why would he bring a drink that was not what she ordered all the way from the bar? Then we ordered our enchiladas. We asked for both with no sour cream. When they arrived at the table, both had sour cream on top. You can see where I am going with this.  Once my entree hit the table, I asked if they had any hot sauce. \"Yes, we have a nice habenero hot sauce.\" I asked for some... Never came to the table. It was literally one thing after another all night long. By the end of the night, I needed to inform a manager of our experience. I did, and she offered us a round of drinks. We had already consumed two margaritas each, and didn't want another one. Then she offered us a dessert. That was included in our voucher. Again, she was nice, and I didn't ask for anything... Just wanted her to be aware.  A few minutes later, the server grabbed our dishes to box up... We only ate about half. There was a lot of food! He then came back, and we asked for the check. He made a snide comment about the experience not being \"up to standard,\" which it wasn't, and walked away. Why would the manager mention that to him while we were still in the restaurant?  We left happy with the food... But the experience was the worst I had seen at the Old Town Tortilla Factory. I remember the first time I visited the Tortilla Factory. Such great memories of sitting outside under the stars eating delicious authentic Mexican fare. I once would recommend people visit the Tortilla Factory, but with the recent experience we had, am not sure I can recommend it again. The food was awesome... Always is. But the service needs work. Hopefully the next item I go everything runs smoothly.",

    "text": "Foodies, stay away, save your money and dine elsewhere!!!  I only gave this restaurant one star because of the ambience. Aside from that the restaurant suffers from an identity crisis, the cuisine is neither Tex-Mex nor good.   I have been coming to this restaurant three years in a row, and sadly the food has declined year over year. To begin with, I ordered a margarita, that was awful! That should have been my first clue. The second one was just as bad. Disappointed and not wanting to try a third time, the Coke I resorted to didn't have enough syrup. The meet for the tacos was dry and the shrimp was frozen and over cooked. One of them tasted like it was past its expiration and smelled fishy. The tortillas stuck together and had been sitting under a warming lamp for a long time. Given the name is the Tortilla Factory, they should take pride in these, however only the appetizer tortillas are made in house. The others are purchased elsewhere. Meal was grossly overpriced and awful!",

    "text": "This was my first visit to the Old Town Tortilla Factory, and it will likely be my last. I'll break my experience down this way:  Food - If I wrote that the food was mediocre, I would be charitable. The queso fundido came out with a texture more like soup than melted cheese. The flavor was not too bad, but the texture was too hard to get past. It was served with in-house flour tortillas, which were nice, but the corn chips that were also served were commercial, mass produced corn chips. You would think that a place that calls itself a \"Tortilla Factory\" would have made their corn chips in house. It's easy to do and would have made a huge difference.  I also order the chicken tortilla soup. It is a chile-based soup with an odd, thick texture to it, as if somebody went a little overboard with the corn starch. I can't say it was as think as Jello, but it did jiggle! It had very little flavor. I would not order it again.  Service - Our server was very pushy, insisting that she new more about what we should order than we did. As this was a birthday celebration, I wanted to buy the guest of honor a \"Millionaire Margarita\"; it's an expensive cocktail but it would show some generosity to the birthday girl and perhaps make her feel a little special. Our server, however, immediately discouraged that order and suggested a different drink. Opportunity robbed.   Drinks - Here's where the Old Town Tortilla Factory shines. I tried several different drinks and I loved every one of them. Tasty, well made, and generous quantities. Here's the only part of the Tortilla Factory that would entice me to return. Kudos to the bartender!",

The chips and salsa or overpriced but the Old Town Tacos are a pretty good deal and usually have the right amount of flavor. Nothing is overly spicy or full of flavor which is a plus for those adverse to spice. I usually end up adding all sorts of salsas and hot sauce to get it where I want lol.  The food would be about three stars for me but once you add in the outdoor seating and ambiance it quickly jumps up to a four. It's a nice place to go with someone you love but I wouldn't go in expecting to be blown away by the food alone.",

I had friends in town and we chose this restaurant and was so so so disappointed !!! What a waste!! The only thing that was good was the outside bar the bartender, he was very good,he used our names & gave great service  and the margaritas were good also . The food was such a disappointment!! There was four of us and nobody was happy with their entrees. We ordered the Seabass ,tortilla soup ,stuffed quesadilla,and the nachos. It took for ever to get our food the restaurant was not even busy for a Saturday night about 7 o'clock. Seabass was cold the quesadilla was greasy the tortilla soup was bland the only thing that was semi-good were the nachos but it was also cold. I wanted this place to be good and I was so disappointed it could be so much better.",

We started the evening with a margarita with a shot of Grand Marnier, it was a bit light for my taste.  We enjoyed a massive basket of chips with a tomato based salsa, it had nice chunks of onion and jalapeno, perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of salt.  For the main entree, I ordered the green enchiladas.  Presentation was on point.  Three chicken and cheese filled enchiladas topped with spoonful of sour cream took up half the square plate with beans and rice filling in the rest.  Serious flavor points!

The servers had kept the drink tub stocked and were very informative when it came to letting the group know that the dinner buffet was ready and when dessert was going to be put out. I didn't see anyone outside of our group in the room while we were using it. Food was average but that could be because it was a buffet. I would park in the arts district and walk the block to the restaurant so you can get a feel of the neighborhood, see the art walk and avoid tipping for valet parking.",

They claim best in show (Food Network) and if that's the case, then I'd stop watching FN... not even worth appetizers.  HOWEVER, head over to the bar and talk tequila!  They are proud of their selection, and on a quiet nite out, even the most experienced tequila lovers will learn a thing or two.  As for the food, touristy and blech .  Im not a fan of tex mex... better luck next time.  El gusto del buen provecho, definitivamente no fue nuestro!",

We were seated at a table right next to the bathroom, even though the restaurant was completely empty.  Our server took over 10 minutes to even come over and offer drinks/water.  The water arrived in dirty plastic cups and the water looked kinda brown, so we didn't drink it.  She took our order and brought us some of their \"famous\" homemade tortillas.  Wow were they bad.  And by bad, I mean they were the worst tortillas I have ever had the misfortune of putting into my mouth.  It was pretty surprising how bad they were since it is the \"tortilla factory\", they should know better.  When our main courses arrived, they looked ok, but tasted awful.  I had a steak and my wife had shrimp tacos.  The steak was over cooked and rubbery, while my wife's tacos were unfortunately served in those same disgusting tortillas.  Even the shrimp and other toppings in her taco were not just bland, but tasted really bad.  I got about 2-3 bites into my steak and her trying her tacos and then we looked at each other in utter shock.  We decided we were going to leave, as we were really hungry and couldn't eat these inedible creations.  We tried to flag down our waitress to get a bill so we could pay and leave, but she was no where to be found.  We did some math and figured out what our tab would be with tax and tip, left the cash, and quickly exited.  Thankfully, Valley Ho's room service, while not amazing, was at least edible.  We will not be going back here, ever!",

Okay.....zero stars for attitude.  Next came that awful salsa, which was even more insulting because we had to pay for it.  Zero stars for that.  Main dish - the quesadilla, was okay - three stars.  Service was okay - 2-3 stars.  Nothing was outstanding, nothing was great, nothing was really good.

    "text": "Breakdown:  Ambiance and Atmosphere - 5 Stars Food - 3 Stars Food vis-a-vis Price - 2 Stars On the Balance - 3 Stars  Old Town Tortilla Factory isn't as bad as some of the reviewers on here make it out to be.  It's a beautiful place to have a nice dinner and enjoy the lovely Arizona desert climate, and the food is acceptable, too.  Where it really stumbles, however, is price, and for that reason my overall opinion is that Old Town Tortilla factory is simply average.  Ambiance - This is where Old Town Tortilla Factory really shines.  The place is in a cozy cottage compound with a couple of buildings (one being an old house).  The architecture is reminiscent of older architecture in the area, and this place can accommodate anything from small romantic dinners for two to huge banquets and anything in between.  The real star is the patio.  It is lovely year-round, and the lighting and water details make this a very pleasant place to dine.  They even have heaters for those who may get a bit chilly.  Food - The food is just average.  It is a fairly standard/conservative/traditional style menu.  There isn't a lot of avant-garde cuisine coming out of this place.  Still, what they do is done competently.  The food was hot, fresh, and perfectly good.  It wasn't as good as some of the more authentic Mexican places in town, and you can easily find more flavorful, complex, and spicy traditional food.  Still, it's not like their food is bad.  It's pretty good, it's just not anything special.  Food vis-a-vis Price - If you're out on the town for a gastronomical experience divorced from ambiance, the Old Town Tortilla Factory does not offer a particularly compelling value.  As I said above, the food isn't bad, but it's just standard.  If you put their food in a lineup with dishes from several other restaurants across the southwest, you're not going to be able to distinguish it out of the crowd of other fairly similar dishes.  Despite average food, they have significantly above average prices.  Expect to pay at least $25-30 per person with one drink and a shared appetizer to go along with one of their lower priced entrees.  If you dine toward the top end of their menu, where entrees can reach as high as $35, it's going to be a pricy night.  That, combined with the fairly expensive drinks and the $3.99 sharing charge on split entrees, you're not going to walk away from this for the price of  \"FourthMeal.\"  On the whole, I give this place three stars.  If I were simply simply reviewing this place based on the food, and I were to divorce the ambiance and atmosphere, it would be a two star joint primarily because of a poor value proposition.  However, considering how compelling the atmosphere is, I'll give them the third star.  The patio is really remarkable, and it's just a very nice place to sit and relax in the Arizona desert.  It's near old town, but it's much more intimate than the very loud establishments closer to Scottsdale Road.  I tend to focus my reviews on food quality, but ambiance is definitely a part of the dining out experience, and that's where Old Town Tortilla Factory shines.  The food is average but overpriced, but the space is just lovely.  It's not an everyday place, and it's not even a place I would go if I were only craving some Mexican food, but if you need a dining experience where the atmosphere is important (perhaps entertaining some out of town guests), Tortilla Factory is worth a look.",

    "text": "Best House Margarita in town, hands down. Honestly, I've tried to duplicate their tangy concoction a few times--the waitstaff says it's the standard stuff--I'm convinced they let the lime juice go a little bad to make it tangy. Call me crazy. Doesn't matter how they make it though, cause that shit's fantastic and it keeps me coming back.   Can't remember their food too much. I mostly just remember that their vegetarian options are sparse or less-than-exciting.  If you've not been to OTTF, make sure to sit outside; you're wasting your time if you end up inside.  BTW, I've only dumped ice from the margarita tumbler all over the table once. Woohoo!",

    "text": "When we found out that they didn't take reservations for parties of less than six, we decided to go early.  We arrived just after 5:00 and found plenty of parking.  We were greeted warmly, and immediately ushered into the dining room after being asked our seating preference.  Our server, Concetta, was efficient and friendly - explaining the Deal Chicken \"can have and can not have\"s.  There was no \"coupon vibe\" at all.  The menu is not extensive and the Deal Chicken deal eliminates most of the pricier entrees.  Still, there is plenty to choose from if you remember that you are in a Mexican restaurant.  The decor is Old Town old - comfortable, but I don't think you'd take your camera out.  The patio looked nice, but hey, it's 104 degrees out - I don't care how many misters you put out there.  And for me, misters over my food is not something I feel great about.  The Chorizo Fundido was the only appetizer available with the deal - but that's ok, it was great.  Slightly splice with lots of chorizo and peppers.  I think some reviewers may have mistaken the peppers for \"coagulated\" cheese.  We ate the entire serving.  The 4 margaritas that were part of the deal were \"OK\", not bad, not great, certainly not over proofed.  Just fine for a dinner that you might want to be able to drive afterwards without being overly concerned about being impaired. They are served in plastic shakers and they hold enough for a few \"top offs\".  They go well with the food.  Concetta was continuously monitoring our table and making sure we were ok, filling our water, asking if we were ready for more margaritas and in general looking after us.  We ordered the \"Old Town Tacos\"  and the \"Achilote Ribs\".  The tacos were, again \"OK\".  Nothing that you would urge your friends to have, but nothing you would try to dissuade them from ordering either unless they asked for your advice.  The ribs - a large portion comes with french fries and coleslaw - was again, \"OK\".  No spice on the ribs stood out.  There wasn't the heat I expected. They were just short of falling off the bone done. They had obviously cooked previously and then sauced and fired.  The hit of the plate was the coleslaw.  It had a cumin component that made it really stand out.  The french frys were wilted and soggy, but that's not uncommon when you get 'Q'.  At this point we were stuffed - and we still had two deserts to go.  Our server recommended the Banana Crisp to have there and the Flan to take home.  The Crisp is sliced bananas in a tortilla that is deep fried and then sauced with raspberry compote.  I can only say that I am not a desert person and this did not make me want to become one.  A cursory taste and we were asking for the bill and a chance to walk some of the food off.  The bill, $106.50 before Deal Chicken was $4.30 after.  We were happy to have had the opportunity to try the place for more than 50% off.  Big eaters will appreciate this place more than those with smaller appetites.  We probably won't go back for dinner, but could stop by for the Chorizo Fundido and a couple of beers.",

Food was very good, if you like spicy food, this is a good place for it.  Platinum margaritas were delicious, wish the would sell by the pitcher, cause their prices for drinks were a little high.  Margaritas should not be more than $10 dollars for top shelf, unless your seeing 12 oz or more.  Nice place for a night out and location gives you options to walk and see art gallery and hit many of the other bars in the area.",

    "text": "Last weekend I had the opportunity to go the Old Town Tortilla Factory in Phoenix. When we got there I was amazed by the under-the-stars seating and the authentic Spanish arch entrance made me feel like I was walking deep into the heart of Mexico.          The Hostess greeted us with friendly brown eyes but ripped our hearts out when she told us that it would be an hour wait. Thinking it would be worth it, we decided to wait on it and even run some errands in the mean time.       When we got back our table was ready and we were seated right away. We were treated to delicious chips and salsa and I must've had at least three bowls by myself. Our waitress was super friendly and made sure we were 100% satisfied. I ordered the Gaucho Burrito and it was everything I could've ever imagined. It was smothered in hatch Chile peppers and my mouth was on fire by the time I was finished. When we got the check my parents seemed to be satisfied even though we didn't leave much of a tip.       In Conclusion, I thought it was a memorable Mexican experience. Every now and then I had to remind myself that I was still in the states. The best part was that I couldn't finish my burrito so I got to eat it again for lunch the next day!",

The first time I came here was for a rehearsal dinner (something I learned they are well known for) and had a great time. We sat outside on the patio and it had a very relaxed feel to it. The food was good and they kept the margarita's coming.   I went here last week and had a really blah experience. I grew up in Tucson so I am used to fantastic Mexican restaurants, and I was wrong to assume that this was in the same boat. I like when menus are five pages long, there are combo plates, rice and beans come with every entree, and chips and salsa are given (not ordered) and continually refreshed as soon as you finish the bowl. Old Town Tortilla Factory had none of those, on top of the fact that there was only one vegetarian option on the entire menu. I ordered the chicken enchiladas (minus chicken, meaning just cheese) and they were not great; they actually had a sour/tart taste to them.   Our server was also not-so-great, he was MIA for the majority of the meal which made it difficult to get refills, condiments, and our check. Also, it was kind of pricey, especially since the quality was pretty low.   I will say this, their order of guacamole is large and in charge (about 3 avocados worth) and pretty tasty.",

I'd rather have chips and salsa. My husband and I both got the Old town taco plate with all three, steak, chicken and shrimp. I liked the shrimp, the steak was just OK and the chicken was dry.

We both ordered the Old Town Tacos - build your own tacos featuring grilled steak, chicken and shrimp with black beans, rice & fresh salsa. They were delicious. The meat was tender, the beans perfectly seasoned.  My only complaint was that the misters could have been turned on sooner as it was 100 degrees, but we were sitting in the shade and weren't over heated.  A very pleasant experience with attentive service, perfect margaritas & delicious food.",

    "text": "We came here because it was across from our hotel. I was worried because of the so-so reviews but our experience was really good. We arrived a half hour before closing but were still given amazing service and were in no way rushed at all. Our waiter gave us a sample of the sangria before we ordered it. The food was a little expensive and I thought it was kind of lame that they charge for chips and salsa- especially when \"tortilla\" is in the name of the restaurant. Also- they ran out of the corn tortillas that came with my entree which I wouldn't have noticed if the waiter didn't mention it- but he did so we were kind of laughing about it. They gave me different tortillas so it was fine, and I appreciate him checking with me in case I had an allergy. The food tasted good, perhaps not the most flavorful southwestern food I've ever had but it came out hot and the portions were big. I really liked the green sauce that came with the old town tacos- not sure what it was but I couldn't stop using it. Our waiter was sweet and took pictures of us in the super cute courtyard where we were seated. The ambiance was great for a special night out.",

They have an outdoor patio that is surrounded by 100 year old pecan trees. The patio is heated in the winter and in the summer months the patio is cooled with misters. You can also go inside by their fireplace for a warm atmosphere during your meal!  It's great for lunch and dinner dates or go during the night life for some drinks and music!   I love any of their margaritas and any food item has been so yummy! (Not a fan of their tortilla soup though). My favorite is the queso dip with chips for an appetizer. I'll get it every time.",

This place wasn't just bad Mexican for Arizona, this would even be considered bad Mexican by Pittsburgh, or maybe even China standards.  Had the meatloaf (which we expected some kind of Mexican twist...) it sounded amazing.  AND the waitress recommended it!  So three people in our party of ten were stuck eating what tasted like meat flavored foam.  My step father ate all of his green enchiladas, but that means little -- he would eat anything someone put in front of him.  When I asked if it was good, he nodded with a \"meh\" expression on his face.   The drinks were ok.   The tortilla bread service with butter was the highlight.    Not inexpensive but not outrageous.   But if you're in Arizona, WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU SETTLE FOR SUBSTANDARD MEXICAN FOOD?   Just don't.",

Being someone who is fortunate to travel around the world, I find it extremely disappointing that this would be the place that left me with such a longing to write this review - just to warn future customers to NOT bother. From our sever being careless, to our food being cold (which I'm sure he most likely just allowed to sit there while continuing to neglect our table) to him not even bother to bring us silverware (WHEN I SAY THE BUS BOY WAS THE MOST HELPFUL I AM SAYING ENOUGH) to that man who picked up this horrible servers job, thank you. You were the only good thing that came out of this visitation. Management might want to consider adding a bit more qualities to hires other than blonde hair and good looks because just the plain disregard for paying customers (who mind you are overpaying for a plate that's most likely worth $10 if that.) If you are considering visiting this joke of an establishment, I would recommend you look elsewhere. If you plan to dine with friends who happen to be of other races and do not posses blonde hair and blue eyes then prepare to be ignored for majority of your time there.",

    "text": "At first we thought we were lucky to get in on a Friday night after 6. In retrospect it's understandable to see why they weren't busy and we got right in. This was to be a reunion dinner for my Mom (83 yo) and my brother and sister and law visiting from CA, and my wife - and it was my decision to go here. What a mistake.   The reception was impersonal and she tried to put us in a dark corner inside. I pointed out two tables by the fireplace and was told that those table were for parties of eight and we were only five. Except for one other couple - we were the only ones in the room! Wife and I went to the two tables - put them together and we sat down.   OK - fast facts - I was told no beer on draft only bottles - so I ordered DXX amber - a bottle of DXX (no amber) arrived with lime sticking out of top. No glass at these prices? Wife had Margarita (rocks no salt) - came with salt and tiny glass with refill. Tasted like crap so she switched to Cabernet. So much for the beginning of Mexican food experience.   My Pork Chili Verde was tough with gristle running through it. Tasted boiled and sauce ladled over it. Pure garbage. I returned it and ordered the chicken pasta. More garbage. Cold, no flavor, runny cheese sauce and hardly any chicken. My Mom had the same dish and ate without complaint - I was embarrassed for her - she was just happy to be with the kids.  Wife had fish tacos. Terrible - no flavor, cold. I didn't find out until this morning that she hated them.   The tortillas they brag about were cold and tasteless. The chips were stale. The guacamole dip was OK if you like only mashed avocado - I've had better at Taco Bell.  Our server was attentive and did the best she could - she took over after the first gal that took drink orders then disappeared. No complaints with her service but reception and the first server were inattentive and poorly trained.   Funny, even after the returned food - we never heard from the manager or anyone. This place is horrible - go somewhere else. I'll never return.  I don't understand the 4 star ratings unless management has insiders writing glowing reports.",

First off, you have to pay for chips and salsa, which is fine, but I find pretty annoying for a Mexican restaurant.  I do expect if I'm paying for chips though, that they are made on site.  These tasted bagged and almost stale, though the salsa was good.  They are definitely trying to offer more upscale Mexican-influenced entrees, but the menu left something to be desired.  I ended up making a meal of sides.  The veggies were cooked fine, but the garlic mashed potatoes were gummy, and had absolutely no flavor.

We arrived at 7:45, the restaurant was very slow, but we were seated in a corner that would never have worked to seat our party.   By 8:10, we were moved to a larger table, but some of us had to stand for 25 minutes because the place they originally sat us was so inappropriate. I feel bad for the couple sitting at a nearby two-top that had a nice view of our butts as they tried to eat.   We had the chips and salsa, adding guacamole, and then cheese dip to keep the kids happy. The guacamole was ok for my tastes with cilantro and jalapenos in it. For out of town kids, it had too much zing for some of them. I can live with that. The cheese dip was melted white cheese (jack?) with a creamy sauce like Alfredo in it. Not at all like what I would expect.   We ordered, and the food finally arrived around 9pm. One of my kids was studying astronomy in school and pointed out at 9:21, lights could be seen streaking across the sky. All the kids went outside to the patio to see this phenomenon, but the men stayed inside and continued their conversation.   That's when the problem started. A busboy asked me in broken English with one hand on my plate if I was done. I said yes. My plate was whisked away.   A few minutes later, the rest of the party returned to find all of their plates had also been taken, quite a few with significant food remaining. A pork chop with one bite out of it. A salad with a large amount remaining. A taco plate with one of two tacos eaten.   As a former restaurant manager, I can say with authority that when an unusual amount of food is left on the plate, it's appropriate to ask: \"do you want this to go?\" \"Are they done eating?\", \"was everything ok with the food\"?, etc. it should give any restaurant worker pause to ask under those circumstances. Apparently not at the old town tortilla factory.   When the party came back after 5 minutes, the whole table had been cleared. Children were upset, adults disappointed. My wife approached the manager and said this isn't right. He immediately blamed me for saying I was done as that was good enough to take whole meals away to the trash. My wife said they weren't done and he essentially called her a liar. He did not ask the other adults or children in our party what they were missing. He wasn't present when I said I was done with my plate. But his steadfast commitment to the position of \"too bad\" is really unacceptable.   I am a business owner for a local business that often hosts out of town guests. Three times I have used Old Town Tortilla Factory for planned dinners for parties ranging from 40 down to 10. (Not counting this dinner).   Reading all these negative posts have an underlying theme: management doesn't care. They don't want to create satisfied guests every time. Their inability to resolve this incident has just lost them my business, and I encourage you to try elsewhere.   Tip to the owner, resolving this gap will net you spring training like crowds, even in the summer, instead of sparse dinner sales. Well worth the investment to hire leadership who cares.",

    "text": "This place should now be called Old Town Tourist Trap.   Brought out-of-town family (seven of us) here for what we thought was going to be a nice dinner out on the patio. Ha!  Here's a summary of the evening (a Wednesday night no less!). The crowd was mostly Spring Training (baseball) fans and it was fairly busy. We had a 7 pm reservation. Table ready when we arrived. (this is the only star they get!).  The margaritas were watered down - basically glorified juice boxes. And this place is suppose to be famous for their margaritas?   Dining Area: Too many tables crammed together, including a wait-station (extra plates, silverware, cleaning rags, napkins, pitchers of tea and etc) in the middle of the dining area. Nasty. And to top it off way too many backwaters and cleaning staff - can't tell you how many times they bumped into our chairs walking by with their buckets of dirty dishes. Management needs to streamline and reduce the number of employees on the floor. Bathrooms a mess - water all over the floor and trash overflowing.  Decor and Ambiance: Christmas lights wrapped around a dead tree that should have been removed years ago and replaced with a live tree. Leftover over Christmas ornaments are still left on the other trees. Really? In late March?!? Tables covered with vinyl. Sticky brown vinyl. Wait staff attire and look is sloppy and disheveled.   We ordered appetizers - nothing special. Tortillas came with butter that was practically frozen. Nephew practically ate a whole basket of tortilla chips! Why? Because we waited for an hour (we watched four tables come after us and finish their dinners - two had already left) ...for our dinner to come.   Our waitress, Samantha, was practically non-existent and spent the better part of the evening hitting on the three guys at the next table.  She should have spent the time yelling at the cooks to get our dinners out and sending the manager to us to apologize. (Side note: the table next to us (the three guys) got their dinner within 15 minutes of sitting down! Their food arrived right after ours did.)  After an hour, the food arrived - mine and my nephew's enchilada's were luke warm. I wanted to walk out at that point, but partner did not want to make a scene in front of the kids.  Not once did Samantha apologize for the el crappo service nor did she bring the manager over to apologize and maybe comp the dinner or drinks.  Bottom Line: Won't be coming here again. And I highly recommend both the locals and tourists to avoid this place.",

    "text": "You know how your wife or girlfriend is always whining about how you never listen to them? This of course as a shoe comes whistling past your cranium. Well The Tortilla Factory must have the same listening skills....their management never listens either.  You would think that after 111 reviews, someone over there would recognize there's a problem with the service.  Nope. This would lead one to conclude no-one in management knows about Yelp, or, and I suspect this is more the case, they can't read,  Prior to writing this, I read some of those 111 reviews in an effort to see how my experience last night paired-up. Uncannily, it was True to form, explaining why this place gets two and a half stars.  Service was bad with waiters only stopping by to sell more drinks. Had to ask for the tortillas twice before ever seeing them..appx 20 minutes waiting on the free tortillas. Hey TF, do I need to remind you of your namesake???  And the prices for the amazingly tasteless food will stupefy you. (I sampled everyone's food in our party of eight)   Old Town Tortilla Factory...you're really one sneaky bastard. Laying in wait....for all the unsuspecting Scottsdale visitors looking for the 'Mexican Food' experience, and instead ambushing them with your bad service, high prices and tasteless garbage you call food.  But you do have some nice attributes, which is why, similar to my situation of never listening, I still have a wife. Only I'm not sure how a fountain, large patio and a cutesy margarita cup are going to keep you in business. Oh well, who cares...right? There'll be another plane full of visitors headed your way tomorrow.   Are you related to Rustlers Roost by any chance?  You both have so much in common.",

    "text": "It may be 100-plus degrees outside, but that isn't going to stop me from sitting on one of the prettiest patios in the Valley for dinner. I went to Old Town Tortilla Factory in Old Town Scottsdale, which combines two of my favorite dining elements-a classy atmosphere with tasty Sonoran-influenced food (the menu also has Native American influences, too).  The restaurant is known for its gorgeous outdoor seating, with candlelit tables and twinkly lights decorating pecan trees throughout the patio. It also has a really cool outdoor bar, which serves excellent margaritas-I had a Blue Agave Margarita ($8.50), with Blue Curaco-it was really sweet, which I liked.  I had been there once previously with a big group, and while everything went smoothly then, things this time were a little rougher. Our server, who was busy with several other tables,  didn't write down our order, and the chips and salsa ($4.99) we ordered came after our salads, only after we asked our server what was up.  I got a Tequila Lime Salad ($4.50), which was amazing and would be a great meal in itself (there's also a dinner portion for $8.99). The leafy greens were topped with refreshing pico de gallo and covered in a tequila lime dressing that had the perfect amount of tart to it. It was so good!  I also really liked the yummy handmade tortillas that were delivered to every table, which were accompanied by a really scrumptious butter. I could have had a meal of that alone!  For my entree, I ordered the Green Enchilada, with cheese and tomatillo sauce ($13.99). Even though I specified I didn't want chicken in it, the enchiladas came with chicken in them, and I didn't have time to eat a new order, which I had to take home. It's just a reminder that no matter how uncool it may look, servers should write down orders to get everything out right. Having disappointing service sort of made the beautiful surroundings a little less appealing, but I would probably still go back because the food, when it comes out correctly, is so delicious.",

The garage is actually the bar, but it does not have a garage feeling or look. Had \"quite a few\" of the Horny Margaritas and they were delish! Fresh squeezed citrus juice with sugar water they actually make. They know how I do margaritas! Had the fish tacos, simple, but so fresh and tasty. The prices are on the higher end, but it shows in the quality of food, location and decor/ambiance, etc. The service was decent, nothing spectacular, but certainly not bad either. Never felt rushed, very relaxing and enjoyable! Great spot to have a nice fresh meal, few adult beverages and excellent conversation!",

    "text": "3 stars might be generous when it comes to the food, but the service was a solid 4 stars and the atmosphere and drinks are 5 star which is what made me bump this up to a 3.   Living in North Scottsdale, I don't venture down to old town very often, but when I do it's to try a new place to eat. I've heard a mix of things about this place and decided to try it out with a couple of friends. As I stated above, the service and ambience are great, as are the margaritas!   Chips and salsa are not standard, they'll set you back an extra $6, but they do have what I gathered to be a \"tortilla of the day\" type situation and that's given freely and in a generous portion!  Let's get to the meat and potatoes of my issue (literally), myself and one other person ordered the Sonoran Meatloaf, which on the menu sounds phenomenal. The plates arrived and looked very nice, though the bacon that's wrapped around it was burnt to a crisp, literally black and bitter. I didn't mind and peeled it away from my meatloaf and started in on the asparagus, sadly it was over cooked and under seasoned, lacking any True flavor and being limo and borderline mushy at the top, but woody and tough at the bottom. No matter I told myself, the meatloaf and mashed potatoes looked delicious...LOOKED, but sadly they too were a disappointment. The meatloaf was very mushy, which commonly happens when there is too much filler (eggs or bread crumbs), the mashed potatoes were basically glue and the theme continued of a lack of seasoning! Normally I'll season food myself at the table (which never can save a dish, but at least helps) but they had no seasoning on the table, no salt or pepper. I can understand this in a restaurant of a certain caliber, when the chef has a deft hand with seasoning and additional flavor as an after thought aren't needed.   The other person at our table got the tacos platter, I was impressed with the assortment of protein (shrimp, steak and chicken) he was slightly disappointed that it was served fajitas style instead of crispy tacos. He did eat them and said that the dish was alright!   Overall if you're down for a cozy little place with a huge outdoor patio and tasty drinks, this is your place. If you are like me and look for those plus a great culinary experience, you'll leave a little disappointed.",

I mean really- Rack of Ribs, Steak, Stuffed Chicken and some other options that weren't very good.   Don't get me started on the staff!  Our waiter was arrogant and uninformative. If you don't want to be known as a Mexican restaurant maybe you should change the name....last I looked tortilla's were strictly a Mexican dish. So what kind of restaurant is it?  Over priced and living on it's historic name and local.   So if you go for drinks, I'm with Noah the house margarita is the best and it packs a kick so be careful!  My friend had the fancier version and didn't like it as well as the house.",

    "text": "So I'm not usually one to negatively review restaurants as I know each diner has their own palate and desires but I feel this one needs a little forewarning to out of towners looking for a great Mexican meal. We were in town for Spring Training and saw advertisements in nearly every publication for this spot and it appeared like a very cool, relaxed, romantic outdoor environment so we said let's do it!  Upon arrival the outside decor looked amazing and like the perfect dining spot for a great meal, drinks, and conversation after a couple of hot days watching baseball. To our dismay the wait for the outdoor courtyard/patio was an hour and a half (understandable though on a Saturday night. So we decided on the 45 min wait for inside and headed to the bar/cocktail area. After waiting nearly 10 min at a cocktail table we were finally addressed and were able to order chips, salsa, and guacamole and two of what were plastered over all their advertisements as \"Arizona's Best Margarita\". The chips and salsa and guacamole were fantastic!!! The margaritas, although accompanied by their own plastic shaker with refills in it, left far more to be desired. Very sweet, no sense of alcohol in it, and on the watered down side... Suppose we should've heeded the other reviews on here about them. Finally our table was ready and I had to chase down our cocktail server to tab out for about 5 minutes since the bartender was unable to assist us with paying as he appeared far less busy than our cocktailer.   Our table was nice, the server very friendly, and we selected a few apps to share since we had filled up on the tasty chips and salsa. The water had a funky taste to it so we passed on that. Chicken quesadilla was okay but I've had better. The Spicy Shrimp Diablo clearly was a lost dish on this menu... Embedded with sundried tomatoes mushrooms and garlic, no heat or sense of spice or Mexican cuisine, it clearly felt like it belonged in an Italian restaurant - the shrimp were cooked perfectly though!   Did see kitchen staff nearly run over three guests as the restrooms are in the same location as the kitchen exit and I'm sure there's numerous instances where collisions and food spills happen because the staff is rushing out without regard for patrons. I guess the woman's restroom is very small and difficult to maneuver around - and my friend is very petite!  Overall I'm sure there are probably really delicious dishes on the menu based on the number of clientele dining but we were left with far more to be desired from this experience. Just a warning for those of you looking for a great Mexican meal.",

Drinks, a little pricy but good. Food was good, my husband has some sort of chicken thing that looked delicious! He couldn't even finish it , there was so much on his plate.  So all in all, a good experience, bill was about 160.00 for a party of 4 with ONE drink each.",

Definitely worth checking out not the best place for Mexican food but definitely an interesting old school spot in Old Town Scottsdale. Ryan the bartender is the bomb he will definitely take care of you and make you feel welcome especially with his drinks and pours. Great guy.",

First, ordered one hot tea, so far so good.  Received the tea and ordered our meals based on some suggestions of what is popular.  The waiter then brought warm tortillas and cheese butter and then I ordered a second hot tea.  Then, we waited. 10-15 minutes later he returned with the tea.  We waited some more. Possibly 20 minutes later the waiter returns to ask us what we ordered. We repeated our order and the waiter said he would buy us dessert for the wait and that our food should be ready in a 2 to 5 minutes.  We waited again!!!!! Another 15 minutes went by I decided it wasn't worth waiting any longer.  I left $5 on the table to cover our tea and proceeded to leave. Told the waiter we were leaving and he said our food would be right up.  Nope.  Not staying any longer to see if it was True.  I am extremely disappointed with the service and feel management should have stepped in.  With all the choices in Old Town Scottsdale, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!",

The evening we came we tried a red pepper tortilla that also came with a jalepeno butter. Oh my gosh!!!   I thought that everything was just absolutely delicious and perfect.

Started off by sampling a few different margaritas - which were all awesome! Instead of chips and salsa, they give you warm, homemade tortillas with butter to snack on while you wait for your meal. I got a combination of shrimp, steak, and and chicken tacos for my entree and loved them all. I raved about this place to a co-worker who visited AZ a few months later. Her and her friends loved it as well! I will definitely be going back when I am back in Arizona for a friend's Bachelorette party!",

The warm tortillas they send out with butter are ahhhmazimg (they rotate flavors of tortilla and butter I believe).   The tacos were flavorful and you definitely get a good amount of food for the price. The platinum margarita is a MUST.  This place really wins me over with the outdoor patio.

Eating outside on the patio was pleasant.   The food was mediocre at best. Tried the Red Chile Pork Chop.  The pork chop is thick cut and grilled perfectly.  The ancho raspberry sauce could use more of the spice and smokiness of the ancho chiles.  The garlic mash potatoes and seasonal vegetables were good, nothing spectacular about them. Tried the Red Snapped as well.  The fish was baked to perfection. It was simple seasoned with salt and pepper and herbs and lemons.  The garlic rice could have used more of a garlic taste.  The staff is friendly and quick. The patio dining very pleasant with a fountain in the middle. The water running from the fountain gave a great ambient sounds.  The only downside is parking.  Their parking lot is small but they do offer a valet but it's not free.  If you're lucky, you may park in the street.",

When it came down to the main meal I was way too adventurous for a tex-mex place and ordered the Mexican meat loaf.... eh.  I am sure some would love this but it was definitely smothered with too much chipotle gravy, and the asparagus was, well..... limp.   No worries though, the service was fabulous for the most part, although a little slow to get our bill out to us but that's fine.

When I asked her opinion about an appetizer, she said not to get it but to have chips and salsa instead.  As for the meal, I took her feedback and ordered the grilled mahi mahi tacos. They were small but I am not a big portion eater.  Probably better as an appetizer for most people. They were FANTASTIC.  Best fish tacos I've had in a long time. Loved it was a small size and I sometimes hate eating at Mexican restaurants with huge portions.  Chicken Margarita was also great which was a waitress pick.  Red enchiladas had a lot of sauce (almost mole) and were just okay.  That person in the group wished she listened to the waitress.  Margaritas were all tasty, too.

We were greeted by two different people.  Seating was timely and very pleasant.  Our waiter came immediately to our tables, got us started on our Margaritas and brought the included Fundido appetizer which was very good.  Contrary to other reviewers we did get a basket of chips and salsa as well as fresh tortillas within a few minutes of being seated.  The Margaritas are big and really good.  Again, to get 2 each was a great deal.  Our waiter, Trent, was very pleasant, efficient and nice.  No bad attitude about the deal chicken voucher.  I had the taco plate, shrimp, beef and chicken served with beans, rice and 3 more tortillas.  Good but a lot to eat!  My daughter had a spicy chicken dish, she really liked it but, like me, said it was too much food.  It seems the reviews here are based on the poor service as opposed to the quality of food but I have to give the establishment 5 stars because I can't fault to service in the least.  They really went out of their way to make sure we had a good time.  We sat inside, too hot outside, but there were 20 or more people enjoying the evening on the beautiful patio under the mister system.  Would I go back?  Yes, with a deal chicken.  Had we paid full price the dinner would have been over $100 total  including the drinks which to me is too pricy for a Mexican restaurant.",

    "text": "Initially, this place had a solid 5 stars going for it. Waited in the bar for our table and had a drink which was very good.  After a short wait, we were seated in the patio area, which has a relaxing, running water type feel going on. I dug it. We ordered a couple more drinks which came out immediately along with some chips and salsa. I must say that the salsa was incredible. At this point the dining experience was really good, but then the food came out. After taking a couple bites, we both stared at each other with a WTF kind of look on our faces. The texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong. We pushed the plates away, ordered another round and spent the next 30 minutes debating how we thought the meat was cooked.  Aesthetically, this place is amazing! The staff was friendly and very helpful and the bar was above average for a restaurant. Unfortunatelly, for Old Town, I go to restaurants to eat, and frankly the food here sucks.",

My wife got the southwest salad and it tasted like something out of a premade salad bag with zero meat and mediocre flavoring. My green enchiladas were good but small in portion size for $15. Overpriced and not impressive.",

The food was great.  We had stuffed quesadillas for appetizers that were absolutely delicious!  The complimentary cheese tortillas when we were seated were also quite the treat!

    "text": "We live in Litchfield Park, but took the trip to Scottsdale based on this place's reputation. The building and decor are super nice in a throwback Spanish mission sort of way. The separate \"tequilleria\" and patio are attention getting. since it was 119 degrees, we sat inside.   That is where the fun ended.   We ordered chips and salsa for $5. No big deal, but where else do you pay for that in any sit down joints anymore? They do bring out fresh tortillas, gratis, but we didn't know that and it's not mentioned on the menu.  The menu is pretty limited and oh so pricey. $15.00 for two a la cart tacos. Holey Moley, they better be stuffed with caviar. There is no taco on the planet worth $7.50 (maybe worth $7 :-)) and I have had some great tacos. These are not those tacos.  The fish tacos were under seasoned portions of Mahi Mahi. The fish itself was not seasoned at all and actually had a fishy taste. Not pleasant. It was served with radishes rather than coleslaw which was interesting and the crema which was tasty. But as a whole, it was bland and underwhelming even after adding the accompanying sauce.  We also had the bacon wrapped spicy meatloaf on garlic mashed potatoes. Served with a zippy red pepper sauce and tree trunk sized asparagus. The sauce was very tasty, the meatloaf was tender and not  dry. There was something so rich in the meatloaf itself, that after 3/4 of one slice, I couldn't eat anymore of it. It just began to turn my stomach. The potatoes were cooked really well and had some nice flavor, but needed salt. That was funny, because there was no salt on the table. The asparagus was well cooked and still had some snap, but like the potatoes, it was under seasoned.  We ordered the banana stuffed fried tortilla in blackberry reduction and were disappointed there too. The tortillas were overstuffed with banana, so that you couldn't enjoy the crunchy texture of the cinnamon crusted tortilla. It just became mush. The reduction was not \"reduced\" and was runny, but tasty.   For three of us, the tab totaled over $85 before tip. That included 2 bud lights, which WERE cold and refreshing.   All said, the environment is far more interesting than the food. The place's reputation is undeserved at half the price!",

I thought for sure that after drinking the margaritas I would turn red from drinking all that alcohol. That's because I'm allergic to something in the alcohol whether it be beer, wine or the hard stuff. NOT!! These drinks were watered down. Average price for their margaritas came to $11.20. Maybe if we paid full price for our meals, it would have been much better.  My wife had the Pollo Margarita, stuffed chicken breast . which was a lot of food for her. She brought half of it home. I ordered the Grilled Salmon which was so GOOD that I cleaned the plate.   The next order was for dessert which I had the Flan and my wife had the Tuxedo cheesecake.  The service was excellent. maybe because the table we were at was reserved for 8:00. Our server. Samantha, was very knowledgeable and personable. She was on top of everything; water glasses were constantly filled and she would make sure all the finished plates were removed.",

I really wished the queso was hotter (temperature wise) and a much larger portion. My combo plate was good but not amazing as I had hoped for. Again nothing was bad I was just hoping for more. The different tortillas we tried we all delicious. Id go back here again just to drink in the courtyard and snack. Im not sold on the full dinner experience as it was just so-so.

The table was not ready so the hostess asked us to wait again.  She virtually ran back and forth a few times and finally managed to seat us.  Why they called us and left us standing with our drinks and appetizer in hand is beyond me. Most restaurants would have transferred drinks and appetizers for us.   Then we find out the bar and the restaurant have two separate billing systems and we should have settled the bar bill in the bar - how were we to know that?  The food was okay but really nothing special.  Chips and salsa is $6.00 - lots of tortillas with the meal.  The kids got pasta but it was way too rich and they both didn't eat it much.  The heaters were on outside but it was still freezing.  The food and atmosphere were fine but more hype than substance.",

But unfortunately, the food was just OK.  Everything needed salt or seasoning of some sort, it was rather bland.  We started with the guacamole.  Nothing special there.  The sea bass was supposed to be topped with a jalapeno hollaise sauce, but there was so little of it that I could not even taste it.  The red enchiladas were very bland.  The meatloaf was pretty good after adding salt.  The best out of what we ordered was the penne con pollo.  The balsamic reduction was very good and really made the dish.  I would probably not come back though since the majority of our meals were not great.",

Not sure our margaritas had alcohol, though they were pretty tasty and for the price should've come with a fifth of tequila. For $15-30 a plate, you think you'd get a little more for your dollar, like chips and salsa included.   We'll probably stick with the more traditional Mexican from now on, but if we've got family in town this might... Might be a choice.",

Had one of their recommended margaritas and although the taste was nice and light for a warm evening there was a reason it was nice and light...I don't know if they pour extra warm ingredients over the ice then shake it up a lot for a watered down taste or if there is simply no booze in the drink but was extremely weak and my guest said his was the same.  I ordered the fish tacos of which there were three and they were just OK.  Served on tiny corn tortillas with a very small amount of jalapeno sauce and no roasted corn guacamole which it should have come with. My guest had the achiote ribs which surprisingly came as an entire slab. Neither he nor I were familiar with achiote sauce beyond knowing that achiote is a spice but even if we were we would have expected the \"glazed with...\" description to be an actual glaze and not a 1-inch thick bland paste. The ribs were tender just not as flavorful as one would have thought.  Overall the place was overpriced for the quality for food and beverage.  Disappointing.",

Food was very good as well. Pollo marg was solid and the Mahi tacos were tasty, but the apps impressed the most.

    "text": "The courtyard patio is nice... They should stick with that and change everything else.  I called to make a reservation that day for two and was told they weren't taking reservations because rain was in the forecast for that night. We arrived after about 5 minutes of rain to find that they had a party of 90 that was outside that they were trying to accommodate inside. The hostess was rude and said they were trying to figure out what to do with all the people outside that had to be brought inside due to the rain and it could be up to 2 hours until we're sat. Ok. A party of 90 would have been booked well in advance. They knew there was a chance of rain and may need to accommodate them inside prior to the rain falling, that's why they weren't taking reservations, right? We asked if we could eat at the bar and were told yes, only to go to the bar and be told \"no because it suddenly got slammed in the bar.\" So we went back and put our name in because we saw plenty of dry tables throughout the dining areas and sat at the bar and had drinks.  The bartender was friendly but we heard all the servers complaining and it was just a bad vibe all around. Thank god I was with good company here. I bought a 3 course meal for 2 on DealChicken that was going to expire and me lose my money or else we would have gone any place else. The margaritas were good. The appetizer, chorizo fundido, was good. We were done with those when it slowed down enough that the bartender said we could stay there and eat and our table was ready. We sat down at our table for a couple minutes without seeing a server and decided to go back to the bar to finish our food. The servers were confused about who was going to get our table, so it would have been a long time before we could have ordered our entrees if we didn't go back to the bar. My friend ordered tacos, which she had one and took the rest home since she was full on the appetizer and so much time passed between courses. I ordered the pollo margarita which was a little dry, but good. The potato thing was nasty. The chocolate cake we took to go and ate the next day was good.  There's hundreds of restaurants in Old Town and this does not compete against any of them. If you want terrible food and service and a great patio, this is the place. If you go just a couple blocks northeast, you'll find great Mexican food, good service, and a great patio at a different restaurant. There's plenty of competition and this place must get by on a reputation from years ago, because it sucks now.",

Went with a large group on 1/29/2013 I thought it was going to be mexican food so was confused by the vegetarian quesadillas with light cheese for appetizers & dinner without beans, it was rice, vegetables, lots of zuchini, salad  had jicama which made it good & the steak with chipotle was quite good, it looked a little dry but ended up being nice and juicy and delicious. The chicken on the other hand was dry and the sauce was used sparingly so not sure what it was supposed to taste like, I was turned off after a couple bites. The salsa is not spicy so if you like spicy, which i do, it's disappointing but again...this is Tex-Mex so maybe Tex-Mex isn't supposed to be spicy. Margaritas were very lemon & like it had sprite or something in it, I had asked for cadillac margarita and I guess thats what I got, couldn't taste any alcohol. The good thing the food seemed much more lighter and healthier if  that's what you are looking for. The place is really cool looking too.",

I love the Margheritas and the guac is very tasty.  The old town tacos are amazing. However, the second time I dined here I ate inside and  the atmosphere was dark and crowded. The tables were too small and the space is cramped. I would go back here in the summer when the weather is nice because the experience is completely different when you can sit outside. It was like going to two different restaurants depending on the weather.",

The $13 margarita was watered down and the Chorizo Queso was warm (not hot as it should be served). The chips seemed like they were from a bag - Tostitos anyone? What's more there was literally one tablespoon of chorizo in the entire \"dip\", really!? After spending $50 here on 3 drinks and one appetizer we decided to go elsewhere for dinner since we were unimpressed from the get-go.   Even the \"house-made\" tortillas lacked flavor. The only draw is the ambiance of the patio. Move on.",

    "text": "I gave it a good rating, because I experienced a new flavor today. No one gets five stars from me though  Okay, look, I've been to literally HUNDREDS of Mexican joints in my life. All over the place. Small and cheap shacks, taco trucks, high-end (is there such a thing?) restaurants, etc. This place is average plus, nothing to write-home about.   Their chips are blah, but the salsa was very tasty, and blended to a good level. I don't like thick n chunky salsa, but blended. Their guac is okay, and the carne de fuego I ordered as my entree was interesting.   The meat was cooked well, but interestingly, it wasn't spicy. I thought with a name like carne de fuego, it would be hot n spicy. Not the case, as the sauce was quite sweet, actually.   The new flavor that I experienced here was the creamy sweet potato that was encased in a chile. The chili imparted a spicy flavor onto the sweet potato that I had never experienced before, and for that reason I was happy today.   But at a $30 plus price point, I feel that I could have gotten an almost-as-good experience at a place like Acapulco for around a third less. I know you think it's lame to compare this to Acapulco, but not really. I give this place a good rating for my unique flavor, the salsa being good, and the layout of the restaurant being excellent, with a separation between main indoor restaurant, outdoor experience, and separate sports bar area.",

However one evening as we were driving through the Old Town area we saw the place and said there is the Old Town Tortilla Factory that we've heard about and the setting drew us in. If nothing else the outdoor seating area is worth the trip. Along with the usual chips and salsa they serve complimentary fresh made tortillas with butter. You know they are fresh as you can stand there and watch them made right before your eyes. My first thought was okay a tortilla how good could that be. I decided it could be that good, that night they were serving a black bean tortilla with a cheddar butter and it was delicious.  I went pretty basic that night and ordered the Old Town Tacos and was blown away by the size of the serving it was a build your own taco plate that came with steak, chicken and shrimp along with some black beans, rice a pico and some lettuce. The steak and chicken were outstanding. Surprisingly enough perhaps the highlight of the evening was off of the children's menu. The cheese crisp was amazing some melted cheese on a crisp tortilla, I so glad our granddaughter was with us otherwise we may have missed out.  If i'm in the area again I will definitely order from the childrens menu.",

All of the main entrees of the entrees were good but the supporting vegetables, fries, etc. were just OK. The waiter was attentive and the prices seemed appropriate but unfortunately for us the food was just OK in general with exception of the Fundito. I would come here again because the atmosphere is great and socially awesome, but I'd hope that next time the entree would out do the appetizer.",

I ordered the Carne de Fuego which was excellent and on second glance I took notice of the sweet potato puree stuffed in the Anaheim Chile.  I liked that look.

The old town tacos are fair enough for the beginner; including shrimp, beef, and chicken fajita. I like the Spanish rice here. But mostly I love their tortillas.

Chicken Monterey was dry and lacked a lot of flavor. When I added the table salsa, it made it worse. The salsa was not pleasant and it tasted like it was made from a can stuff... I say stuff, because I want to keep it clean.  Build your tacos w/shrimp was really bad. The shrimp had no flavor along with the chicken and meat. The tortillas it came with, was a lower end tortilla (ghetto) and wasn't homemade. They have corn, flour, and potato tortillas..  Stick with the potato, but sure you ask for them in advance, because the cook can stop making them anytime.   The green enchiladas were ok.... They tasted a lot better than everything else... We all took a few bites and left our food... I told Matt I didn't want my food boxed, I just wanted a few more potato tortillas; however the cook stopped... I think the cooked stopped years ago.

I had an original and a peach margarita--both were good, although they could have been stronger. Before the meal came, the server brought homemade spinach tortillas and cheese butter. Amazing! The tortillas were soft and delicious and the cheese butter went very well with the spinach tortillas. For my entree, I had the Red Enchiladas, and all I can say is, HOLY CILANTRO, Batman! Unfortunately, the main flavor I tasted was cilantro, and I can't stand cilantro. A person who isn't as adverse to this flavor may have no issue, but I did. The corn tortillas that were used for the enchiladas were fantastic--I just wish I had a better idea of what the red sauce tastes like, but the overpowering cilantro prevented that...",

Last night we were seated in the beautiful courtyard Nextel fire and waterfall. Unfortunately our server was more d in the girl waiter he was flirting with than our service.  I've heard that the kitchen takes forever and this trip was the worse of all.  Sat with our kids for an hour to get our meal.  Restaurants that don't work to the end of the evening are just poorly managed and this place is obviously very bad in that department.  It's a cool Scottsdale location, but beware unless you are patient enough to put up with poor service and a long wait.",

First of all, it's insane to pay for chips and salsa when I'm paying $60+ on a dinner for two. The chips and salsa were ok, salsa wasn't very flavorful and had no spice at all. I like my salsa to be at least a little spicy (personal preference). Anyways, my friend had about 2 pieces of shrimp on his plate, while I had about 6. There was close to zero amount of other things we could fill our tacos with & the chicken was completely bland. And let's not forget that we walked in at 6 and finally walked out at about 7:30 and there were only about two or three other guests. So, yes the service was nonexistent. The server was rude, no personality, he barely waited on us, never refilled our drinks or came to check on our food. Nothing! & it's a shame because we would have probably gotten a lot more cocktails if he would have come over, so their loss. I definitely wouldn't make another trip back here, completely overrated and way better selection of Mexican food in this area.",

There's a good variety of entrees featuring different types of seafood and meat, and plenty of southwest flavors.  The margaritas, served with a little shaker of extra, are excellent too.  My mom actually drank a whole one, which, maybe you don't know my mom, but, trust me, is saying something.  The ambiance out on the patio (when it's not too hot outside) is quite comfortable and cozy, with the fountain and the strings of lights.  Also, they have homemade flavored tortillas, with different flavors featured daily, but sometimes the waitstaff doesn't seem overly eager to give them out.  Had to deduct one star for service.  Other than that, I highly recommend this place.",

Lovely patio atmosphere in Old Town, the service was quite good and we were able to have a very relaxing dinner.  We went at 6:30 on a Saturday night, and there was no wait for a patio table.  I give the menu some points for trying to be inventive - I had the Pollo Margarita, as did my partner, and it was fine, but I understand why people criticize the food for being a bit on the bland side.  My brother in law had the meatloaf with chipotle sauce (he's the culinary guy in the group) and he was quite pleased with it.  SIL had the red enchiladas, and while not her favorite, she said they were good.  My partner and his brother were raised on homemade tortillas, so they were not impressed with the tortillas here, although they are house made and I thought very good, as a gringo.  So yes, three stars for a perfectly good place, but if they stepped the food up a notch, I would go the extra star.",

It was not busy when we arrived but had fiully filled in by the time we were finished, which was about 1.5 hours later. We started with the crab dip appetizer which was very good but didn't come with enough chips.  For a price of $15 we didn't feel it was unreasonable to request some additional chips when ours were gone.  The waiter finally returned with the additional chips 15 minutes later!  During this time my wife's drink needed a refill and we requested that when our chips had arrived.  The drink refill did not arrive until after our meal was delivered to the table, and even then another reminder was needed.  After we began eating our meals, the waiter never returned to see if everything was ok, or ask if we needed anything.  That too was unfortunate, because a couple of extra napkins would have been nice.  Like everything else that took place, it was an extremely lengthy process getting our bill.   I am told this restaurant provides fresh tortillas with butter when you arrive, but apparently that depends on who your waiter is, because we were never offered anything.  Overall, our waiter was just not considerate, friendly or polite and seemed as if we were a burden to him. This is the first negative review I have ever written for a restaurant, but I felt that others might want to know what they may be getting themselves into if they plan an evening here.  The food is good, although a bit pricey, but don't expect to be served in any way.",

For someone who prefers mild warmth to severe heat, the atmosphere was perfect in April. Having just been there in February, the temperature was a little chilly.  The restaurant has an indoor seating area, though I cannot imagine a scenario when I would try to sit there. There is also a full patio which is why you have no reason to go inside.   The patio (covered in the rain) has space heaters if it does get cold out. There is a beautiful fountain in the middle of the patio that mixes a fire and water show with ambiance.   The menu is a modified Mexican. Traditional Mexican meals and tastes presented in new ways. The food is very good and I am told their margaritas, though not the best in town, are very good as well.",

I have lived in Scottsdale for a looooooong time and usually when I dislike a place, it's for something like customer service, or overcooking my $35 steak, or a hair in my corn chowder, but this, this was an EXPERIENCE. My best buddy moved back from San Diego this past year and it was her birthday. She loves Mexican food and I had heard about the \"great patio\" and \"delicious margaritas\" this place had. It is also next to one of my favorite hotels, the Valley Ho. Well, everything I heard about this place IS True. The margaritas WERE good (better be at over $9 a pop) and the patio is breathtakingly lovely. But OH MY GOD... the food is INEDIBLE, and when I mean INEDIBLE, I mean I swing by McDonald's on the way home for chicken nuggets. THAT inedible. The salsa was so weak I had to ask for hot sauce to basically make it go from tomato paste to some flavor. We ordered a crab dip, and it was just chunks of crab (which I was fairly confident was imitation, but mind you, I was sucking down as many margaritas as I could to mask the horrendous meal I was consuming) and avocados. I didn't even understand it. I ordered mole ribs, and the were inedible. I took two bites, and threw it away when I got to a dumpster. Normally, if it was me just dining alone, or with my fiancee, I would have wigged out, but it was a birthday, for my friend, and in all honesty, our server was top notch. She was so sweet, attentive, and wonderful, and took all of our pictures, and helped us cut the cake and everything. I would have felt bad complaining, ruining a birthday, and frankly, what would I complain about? \"Your food tastes flavorless\"? \"I have had better Mexican food at Del Taco\"? I am at a loss at how this place is still in business. It was SLAMMED when we were there. Please, if you want Mexican food in south Scottsdale, go to the Mission. I am embarrassed to say I did not check out what my fellow yelpers would have said about this place, cause I would have steered clear! Dear Tortilla Factory, go to Mexico for a while and learn what a taco tastes like, heck, just save yourself the trip and go to Taco Bell.",

    "text": "This place is the perfect example of a tourist trap.  Nice location not far of the main drag of Old Scottsdale, beautiful building and layout.  The margaritas are good, but probably $2-$3 more expensive than they ought to be for every one of the many styles.  I thought paying $5 for chips and salsa was a rip-off, but then when the chips tasted stale, I was even less happy.  C'mon, if you have tortilla and factory in your name, you ought to have fresh chips.  I thought the tortillas themselves were okay, not great, but okay.  The carne fuego, or whatever I had the waitress recommended, was not good.  Small chunks of fire roasted steak completely ruined by a gloppy sweet/hot sauce. The veggies that went with it were just okay and the sweet potato-stuffed chile was weird.  It could've been great, but it was nowhere near good.  Unless your Aunt Hattie who has never had Mexican food is in town from Ohio, i'd skip this place altogether.",

    "text": "Well, My wife got a deal on Deal Chicken for an app, 2 entrees, and 4 margaritas, and dessert for $44 (supposed value $110). I thought is was a great deal, but there were some problems with the food and ambiance. The food was bland across the board. the app we got with the deal was chorizo fundido (not much flavor) and the chips/salsa need some work. The salsa tasted like tomato puree from a can, and my entree (Pollo Margarita) had a great presentation, but the meat was dry and the \"Chipotle\" mash potatoes tasted like paste. My wife (Vegetarian) opted for the Penne con Pollo (without the chicken). The dish describes veggies in the pasta, but little was seen. The drinks were ok, but tasted like Sprite was added to the margaritas. We had enough of the food and got the cake to go, which actually was the best part we ate the next day. It was 100 degrees that night, and we ate inside....SUFFER and eat outside...the ambiance is much better (fountain and lights) than inside (dim and plain). The service was great (the reason for 2 stars)!!!! But too bad the food/drinks couldn't match :(.  I felt the experience wasn't worth the $44, and could've got better tex/mex at a hole in the wall place somewhere else in Scottsdale.  Look at the magazine covers they have framed, about \"how good the Tortilla Factory is\"...they're all from 2002-2006...TIME TO UPDATE TORTILLA FACTORY!",

I planned a low-key wedding reception at Tortilla Factory & left on my wedding night in TEARS!!  Every bride's dream, right?!  We started planning the event 9 months in advance & everything SEEMED to be in order.  Three months before the wedding, I confirmed the prices that were quoted.  Suzannah stated that tax & tip were included in the $63/person price.  We show up after our wedding for our reception, the tables were set up in a different area than she told us they would be, my cake was missing the topper (Suzannah tried to blame the bakery, saying they never delivered it...of course, it was in Tortilla Factory's refrigerator!), other patrons of the restaurant were seated in our reserved area, and at the end of the night the bill was $1700.00 more than she quoted!!  We asked to see the manager & he was completely clueless as to anything & offered no help in resolving the situation.  We were forced to open all our wedding gift cards at the reception to scrounge up the extra $1700.00, as well as having to ask our parents for more money to help pay what Suzannah lied about.  She then pulled out the contract that we had never signed & it did not say ANYWHERE on it that tax & tip were not included.  I was unable to pull up the email where she promised it WAS already included, since I had changed to a new email address.  Instead of being professional, she stood there and argued with us in front of all our guests and WOULD NOT stop talking, trying to blame us for her mistake.  Besides all of this, as if it weren't enough, the FOOD WAS HORRIBLE & clearly not worth $63/person!  Filet Mignon was to be served...they gave my guests thinly cut, cheap pieces of what looked like sirloin.  I felt like we were at the Sizzler!!  Nasty.    I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this place to my worst enemy!!",

I had a lot of people coming in from out of town and staying at the Vally Ho so we chose this place because it was within walking distance.  I must say I was hesitant because I went with my then fiance (now husband) for dinner one night just to check it out and I was not impressed with the food.  However my very large group was so well accomodated, I couldn't have asked for more.  I would hightly recommend getting the hors d'oeurves packages that they offer.  A great price and something for everyone, they can get a plate and munch at bar tops with drinks while talking to everyone.  It was like having a bar with drinks and food just for my wedding party and family.  A truly great experience and I look forward to using this restaurant in the future for any event that requires a great atmosphere with great food and great service, for a large party.",

We were really pushed, being served our soup before our appetizer and our entree while we were still eating our appetizer.  Also, the food, which we liked so much has really dropped off.

I sent it back (which I never do) after one bite.  The waitress very nicely offered to bring me something else - the carne del fuego.

Save yourself the time and money and go to the heart of Old Town and pick literally any restaurant , and I guarantee it will better.   First, look at the menu and notice the prices. I'm all for going out and spending $20 or more for an entree but I expect something better than what I would get at chipotle. I ordered the mahi mahi fish tacos. They were horrendous. The portions were small and I still couldn't finish it because it was so bad. The fish was far beyond having some color, it were totally burnt. Absolutely no seasoning and the sauce was bland and strange tasting. The tortillas were clearly store bought. Dry and stale, probably left over from the night before. I have been to Mexico and know what handmade tortillas taste like. I also know what's like to buy tortillas from frys and leave it in the fridge for 3 months. I experienced the latter, big let down since the name of the restaurant implied that they make their own. Drinks were expensive and didn't have more than 1 shot of tequila. Service was slow and didn't even bring chips and salsa out. Total joke.",

The freshly prepared tortillas served before our meal were delicious, but that was where it ended for me. I prefer bold flavored Mexican and this was bland . . . My husband tried the ribs and the sauce was basically like a tomato sauce with very little flavor. Our daughter insisted on chocolate cake for dessert, which had been obviously frozen and in turn dried out. Our waitress was excellent; although, extremely busy with numerous tables so some things took her a little longer to deliver on requests.

Two things bothered me. One is that the food is pretty pricy. I realize it's right in the middle of downtown Scottsdale and many tourists probably eat there. Maybe more locals would if the prices were about $5 less per entree. The other thing is \"no separate checks\". This is so inconvenient for a couple reasons. Our visitors were not paying for our meal so it would have been nice to have two separate checks. We ended up paying for dinner and them trying to pay us back. The other thing is, because no separate check, our visitors sat there trying to figure the bill out. It got embarrassing until we took the check and paid. Not a fun experience.",

Outdoor seating was quite pleasant but I wish the staff would've been more proactive in turning on the heaters as it was chilly outside (we asked at the beginning of our visit but they forgot about it until we tried to turn the heaters on by ourselves). In summation, the experience was visually pleasing but there was still room for satisfaction in the taste and wallet region. This place is an \"okay\" choice for a night out.",

    "text": "I'm torn by our experience there. My girl friend and I went to celebrate the evening and the place looks terrific. Let's hit the low notes first-  When the salsa and chips arrived we were shocked at how bland the salsa was. Tasted like it came out of a jar. The chips were boring and tasted and felt like they were made in a factory.  Like maybe in Mexico a few weeks earlier.  So the name is apt.  Come on folks this is Arizona get it together with the salsa and chips.  .  The enchiladas ( cheese and chicken)  were boring. The sauce tasted like canned Las Palmas.  The rice was a bit bland also  ( are they cooking for Amish children and Wisconsin wimps?) The beans however were great. Surprise.  Now. I have to say the fish entree was totally fabulous. Really great piece of white fish. Plump and juicy and prepared excellently!! We concentrated on the fish and left the rest pretty much alone.  The gal who served us was very sweet and made a lot of effort to correct some errors for us. I felt bad that besides the fish the rest of the meals were sub standard.  Atmosphere and service great. Mexican Food was poor. The fish fillet great!   Good luck! Too many other great Mexican restaurants around town to bother to go back to this one.",

    "text": "I visited the Old Town Tortilla factory about five years ago with fond memories so when back in Scottsdale tonight I decided to give it another go.  I should have read the Yelp reviews before going, my experience was nothing special. My waiter was friendly enough but the food was just OK. I ordered the Grilled Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos. Upon my waiters advice I order the \"sauce\" on the side because I was concerned about them being too spicy. What I received was three \"chunks of fish\" on three mini tortillas with four small condiment bowls containing the black beans, jalapeno sauce, guacamole and a white cucumber sauce? It just looked kinda strange and the fish wasn't all that fresh. I didn't complain because my waiter only asked if I wanted dessert.   Maybe it's me but it just wasn't what I expected. I think there are a lot of other good choices in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "I love the concept of crowdsourcing, but in practice it has some flaws; namely, no filter often equals skewed and even poor input. Dinner last evening was a great example.   Yelpers haven't been entirely complementary towards this establishment, but the group we had been working with had suggested this place for dinner, and my friend was interested in the homemade tortillas, so with my Yelp apprehension in hand, off we went.  It was a beautiful February evening, and having just come from Colorado, how could I not sit on the patio. They had plenty of heaters to take the edge off of cool, but they weren't needed last night. I need to take a quick back step though. When we arrived, the street and the parking lot were full, and there was an additional pay lot across the street. I figured this place must be packed, but we risked it and were pleasantly surprised how much room there was! I was very happy we could get in, but did wonder if the place was full, how it could impact service.   We had a very pleasant waitress who answered all of our questions about the menu and ingredients. (My friend is allergic to tomatoes so Mexican can be a challenge). We also briefly discussed the silly Yelp complaints about having to pay for chips and salsa. Just because some places offer chips and salsa does not mean every Mexican restaurant must. More to the point, this place has complementary freshly made tortillas and chipotle butter. Last night they were spinach tortillas. I am not a flour tortillas guy as I find they often have a slight raw flour taste to them, and these were no exception. I was only able to eat like 6 of them (hey, that chipotle butter is great)!  I began with a Caesar salad. Not the quintessential Mexican starter, but they added jicama and red peppers. I didn't take a picture but unless you feel the need to really graze, the small salad was much larger than any dinner or side salad I have had before. The lettuce and other veggies were very fresh and crunchy as were the croutons.  It is interesting how much Yelp reviews can impact my menu selections. I like to put thought and time into my reviews, therefore I often find myself hesitating ordering something because of a Yelp comment. Last night I considered ordering the pork Verde, but because I had read a review that described it as watery any lacking pork, I crossed it off the short list and went with the red chili pork chop. Wow! If you are a pork fan at all, don't pass this up. It consisted of two grilled, bone-in chops (see the picture). They were done just how I like pork chops, juicy in the middle, a bit more done along the edges, and just a little suet to add the porky flavor. The red chili was very flavorful and had a bit of heat.  This is a good time to address spices and Mexican food, as several people felt the need to say the food here was not spicy, and even bland. \"Hey World, Mexican food doesn't have to, (nor should it) burn the roof of your mouth. You are confusing it with Tex-Mex.\" Nuff said.  If I had any critique, besides the slightly raw-flower taste to some of the tortillas, would be the too subtle garlic in the potatoes. I know I risk the same critique as I leveled above, but I will rationalize it by saying that I think it is okay to take liberal advantage of a named dish element. Ok, indefensible.   Some odds and ends. 1) They split our ticket even though the menu says won't. 2) They gave my friend several chipotle butter cups to take home. 3) Every single wait person (4) I chatted with were friendly and engaging. In fact, they initiated the short conversations.   So five stars because the evening began with pleasant weather and ended with two very satisfied customers.",

Food was flavorless, and the food that was supposed to be warm came out cool. The service was some of worst that I've ever had. Might as well not have had a server. Don't go here.

I got green enchiladas which were decent and my son loved his taquitos (which actually seemed to be made there and not frozen from Costco).    But the salsa was *super* bland with no kick at all, and (whether reasonable or not) I tend to be annoyed when Mexican restaurants charge for chips/salsa service.  I did love their warm little tortillas/sour cream chive butter, but even that was weird, it seems to be their version of chips/salsa..... but only came out after we'd ordered several apps and with no warning - seems to me that a simple \"Hi, welcome!  We don't do free chips and salsa here but we have something even better coming your way!\" when seated would probably negate some of the whiny \"no free chips???\" reviews!",

Best I've found in the Phoenix area and the service was spot on.   The food is pretty good but there are things I'd do different. Such as their use of aneheim chiles in their green chile dishes and sauces rather than authentic hatch New Mexican big Jim's...  but, I've found that most Arizonans hate anything spicy, so I understand. That's a Sonoran thing...  Part of being a successful business is knowing your market.  That said, as far as Mexican food goes, this place lands squarely in what's known as \"southwestern style\". Which, frankly, is a nice break from all the \"Sonoran\" style places around the valley.  (Sonoran is a Spanish word that means \"bland\") (lol)  The chips were average but the house salsa was pretty good. Nice flavor and a bit of heat. I asked for \"something hotter\" and was brought a ramekin of their habanero which had plenty of kick!    For my main dish I had the chicken enchilada dish and the server told me the green sauce, even though not hatch green, was pretty good. I was skeptical so I ordered \"Christmas\". Once I explained what that meant, I got a dish with both the red and the green chile sauces. The red was pretty basic but the green, even though not hatch, was delicious.   Moms had the old town tacos, which she said were delicious and Costa had the penne con pollo which he devoured.   All in all it was a great meal and the staff didn't seem to mind a bit that we hung around for three hours even though they were pretty busy for a weeknight due to cooperate events they were hosting.   Although the place is a little pricy, I can't wait to go back to try more stuffs!",

We had a one person ordered a quesadilla that was churchy and buttery. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos. The chef could have cooked it less and could have added additional seasoning. The rice was very tasteful, along with the veggies. Margaritas were refreshing. I would recommend the platinum margarita.",

Came here with my gang and it was buffet style but regardless I must rate the place. We had a nice baby green salad with some balsamic vinaigrette, but things went downhill from here fast. Let's start with the pork; Cough! Cough! (Pound the chest!).  Someone pass me some water cause as much as I chewed it didn't go down - It was so dry it soaked up my saliva! Atop of it were some chili flakes so that didn't help much. The stuffed chicken came with a nice creamy sauce, but I don't recall what it tasted like.  The pork overwhelmed me and to add insult to injury don't serve mashed potatoes to dry out my tongue more!  Regardless, a friend of mine made a great point; we are served what we did not order.  Saved!  Therefore, I shall return on another visit to give my full report so stay tuned!",

When I called to make a reservation (which they don't take for small parties), they never informed us the entire main restaurant was closed for a private party.  Our only seating options were inside the bar area or outside on the patio in the 107 degree heat. My boyfriend's parents can't sit in 100+ temperatures.  The bar area we were seated in, wreaked of a wet, dirty bar.  Exactly what you'd expect.  I asked for chips & salsa (standard at almost all other Mexican restaurants).  Was told it was an appetizer.  I ordered the $6.00 chips & salsa and the generous portion of chips were old & stale.  The salsa was watered down & tasteless.  The homemade tortillas with flavored butter are still very good.  I ordered the Old Town Tacos and my boyfriend's parents ordered the Sonoran Meatloaf.  The food was decent but the overall experience was average.  There are too many great restaurants in this area of Scottsdale, to settle on this spot.",

Possibly the worst Mexican food I've ever had (and I've had a lot!).  I was vacationing in Phoenix with my wife and fell for the pretty pictures of the patio.  They attempt to be innovative (eg cilantro tortillas with butter for an appetizer ... Which was awful) but it doesn't end up tasting like Mexican food or frankly anything that I'd care to eat  The chili verde was nearly inedible.  The sauce was soupy with very odd flavors and the meat was gristly and of low quality.    Avoid and hopefully the'll close down and something else will move into this great location",

The reservation was made 3 months in advance, menu was preset and all details including dietary restrictions  were discussed ahead of time. When our group of  twelve 11 year old soccer players and 4 adults showed up they had to wait to be seated for about 30 minutes  and then it took additional  90 minutes for  food to be served. When food was served, torillias arrived cold and dry and wait staff seem to be totally overwhelmed , stressed and overall very  unfriendly. When I spoke to the manager and expressed my dissapointment with the poor quality of their service and lack of time management on their part  instead of apologizing restaurant manager actually argued  with me, there were no words \"we are very sorry\"  instead  he kept saying his \"restaurant is not a fast food establishment\" so 90 minute wait in his opinion was a pretty reasonable delay! He kept insisting on telling me  how busy his restaurant was that night with all events happening in town that weekend. He totally disregard the fact that this was why I have  pre-plannned and prearranged our dinner  many months in advance since myself as well as the restaurant staff  was fully aware of how busy that weekend is going to be.! Restaurant Management didn't offer any monetary compensation for us and worst of all no words of apology.  I would definitely NOT  recommend this place for a large group dinning until they get their act together.",

When our first choices were further away than anticipated, we opted for Old Tortilla Factory, thinking from the description that it might be a tad kitschy.  When we saw the patio, we thought, \"not too bad\" and decided to stay.  Unlike the other reviewers, our server was friendly and helpful and attentive to our requests.  I was not, however, terribly impressed by the food, even those famous tortillas.   We started with the queso fundido, which was very watery, and not nearly as flavorful as I'd expect.  This was served along side some red pepper tortillas with jalapeno butter.  The butter was good.  The tortillas were ok, a little on the dense/doughy side for my liking.  Admittedly, I prefer corn, so I was biased from the start, but they tasted just like any other flour tortillas I could find at a supermarket.  For the mains, we got the chicken calabacitas and the pork chile verdes.  The sauce on the chicken was the highlight of my meal - creamy, garlicky, full of flavor.  The chicken underneath was moist, and the accompanying relish was quite tasty.  The pork chile verdes was disappointing.  The pork was dry, the sauce was watery, the potatoes undercooked.  Definitely not worth it.  The drinks were good.  The patio atmosphere was relaxing.  But the food wasn't worth the cost.",

I was so impressed with the city and the overall appeal of shopping and food establishments.  It was an extremely warm day and the air conditioning wasn't working properly in the main restaurant.  We headed out to the bar area, which is just off the main building.  We sat down and ordered a few drinks.  The bartender, I believe his name was Rick, was probably one of the BEST I've ever experienced.  This man truly loves his job.  He had chips and salsa delivered to us and others at the bar for waiting.  He handed out sample drinks, for us to try as he made them, and offered us a sample of his special \"green\" salsa to go with our meal.  One thing I truly appreciated was his service and knowledge about timing of food. We ordered a few items and he suggested that we eat a few things and then decide if we wanted more before putting in our entire order.  I don't know about you, but I tend to order everything on the menu! lol  The food proportions were generous and we didn't need to order the rest of the food.  We ordered the quesadilla and with the special \"green\" salsa, we were in food heaven.  If you are ever in this area, give this spot a try.  Thanks Rick!!!!!!",

And while those things are still great I feel like the food has not kept up over the years. This time I tried the carne de fuego...absolutely no fuego and overall a pretty lack luster taste. The whole dish needed an overall seasoning reboot and without that it was...fine. If it's ambience your going for this is THE spot but currently the food just isn't keeping up.",

I had the mahi mahi tacos and my husband had something that was basically chicken fajitas . Food was good but nothing special. We had a great time and service was great !",

It took 14 minutes for someone to come to our table to take our drink order and for us to order chips and salsa- yes, you have to pay $6 for chips and salsa. Ugh. It was 7:59 before we had our drinks in front of us. 29 minutes seems a little ridiculous...  Maybe it was because we were so hungry- but we really enjoyed the food. The mahi tacos and the green enchiladas were really tasty. The atmosphere was great- beautiful patio. The server was really sweet, but it seems like they were very understaffed.  It is hard for me to recommend this place unless you are okay with sitting around for 30 minutes waiting on a drink.",

However I didn't get the chicken, requested for just beef and shrimp and classic margarita.  They provide homemade tortilla with strawberry butter for the table. Which I thought it was weird but ended up being good.  When you order the margarita it comes with the shaker so you can refill your own glass. My dish was good but wow it was a big portion you can share. You will need to ask for extra tortillas.   Overall good last outing with my friends before returning home.",

It sn't the point....its the breaking point.  First they have a $4 split plate charge, then they started charging for chips. This weekend it took 20 minutes for water at the table in an empty patio setting and we couldn't order drinks. Our house guests were insulted at the lack of service.  We asked several times for wait staff.  A woman looked from behind the lattice work but never came on to the patio.  Next they'll be charging for a straw, a napkin. If you dont complain, the essentials we have come to love as awesome service will disappear. Ooops looks like it already has!",

I dined here with a semi-private party with 40 other guests and we were served buffet-style.  Our group was seated in their outdoor dining area, which I absolutely loved. I thought the atmosphere was great and brought an authentic Southwest feel and vibe to the restaurant. The food was as decent as you would expect sharing buffet-style with 40 other people lined up outdoors: nothing mind-blowingly memorable, but nothing too bad, either.  My one complaint would be the servers. Especially at our single table of 8, it did not seem the server we were assigned was equipped to take care of a large group. There was much unnecessary confusion at the end of the night when it came down to settling some bar tabs. Overall, it did not ruin our experience, but definitely took away from the overall positivity.   Regardless, I would love to come back here with a smaller group and enjoy a fresh plate of food! The outdoor dining is definitely something you can't pass up...",

It is ironic that a place with this name  DOES NOT know how to make tortillas!  The food was tasty, but, served COLD!!  Plates were not even heated.  It was like they were serving us leftovers from the refrigerator.  NEVER had cold Mexican food before except for salsa.  The tiny little tortillas are tasteless & made without salt.  Anyone who has ever eaten a\"real\" tortilla knows that they should not taste like  paper plates & napkins, both which have more flavor than what they try to pull off on tourists as tortillas.  They need to change their name to \"The Tasteless Tortilla Factory\" where everything is served cold. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!  The chocolate cake dessert served to celebrate a member of our party was best of all.  I would return just for that, which of course is cold with the ice cream & whipped cream.    Samantha, our server, has been there 10 years is one of the best servers We have ever had at any restaurant. We should have sent everything back to be served hot and asked her to go buy some tortillas from Manuel's, Garcia's, or Macayo's.  We felt embarrassed for Samantha to take it all back and we feared that their cooks.might spit on our our food, so, we boxed most of it and brought it home to heat it up properly,  today.  We could not believe they have been in business this long with the horrible bad recipe tortillas.   We all guessed that they cater to tourists who know nothing about how good contemporary Mexican food should taste.  We most certainly will NOT return & eat their overpriced cold food & tasteless tortillas.  Samantha and the chocolate cake were the only things good about our visit.  Don't waste your time and money at this joint!  They are too mamy other good fusion & traditional Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale that serve their food properly and whose tortillas taste better than toilet paper.",

I got the old town tacos which are a build your own platter with shrimp, chicken, and steak. The shrimp was good but everything else I barely ate any of. The portions are very big. The margaritas were even disappointing, I got the premium marg and it was very sugary and served in a plastic margarita glass with a palm tree shaped stem...cheesy. Everyone else's margaritas didn't look appetizing either, they looked like they were straight out of a slushy machine and had either too much pink or green artificial dye. I did appreciate that they had a gluten free menu.",

They had black bean tortillas and whipped butter on the tables that was delicious. Margaritas were good and that would probably wrap up all the good.   Now the ugly, we were with a large party that showed up in groups. Which most service people would assume separate checks or at least ask. This wasn't a concern until the end of the evening, when our server presented 1 check and expressed dismay along with words of discouragement that it would take a while to split, very unprofessional for an upscale Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. I believe that the management at this establishment is non existent. Servers seem to do as they please, reach over guests, place plates in front of incorrect guests. Many of the simple things that management would typically ensure that there staff is engaged in doing correctly.   Now the food. Carne y Camerones (steak and shrimp) great ingredients but poor execution. The steak was overcooked as well as the shrimp and served cold. The mashed potatoes were tasty but dry and cold as well. I feel that the cooks had their timing off, maybe because of the large party or just the fact that they didn't care. The technique and the ingredients were there for a great meal but it felt thrown together and was served cold.   This restaurant could be great, they have a good menu, good drinks, great atmosphere, but the service, execution, professionalism, and passion is not there. I blame the management.",

We wanted to watch some of the football games and the only place we could was in their tequila bar area, which was empty, but the worse part is that the TVs were so small that we could not really see the game anyway because we couldn't even read the score, so definitely do not come here to watch any games...  We were seated and greeted by our waitress. She did not come by often and I do not believe she was that smart either but she got her job done I guess.

The cheese tortillas were fantastic! Apparently they have 12 different tortilla flavors. For dessert we had almond flan with berries, SO GOOD!  More please!  And a chocolate cake, I didn't try any of it but it disappeared so it must of been good!  The patio was nice but it's summer in Phoenix so we ate inside.  I don't know if I would go here again.

My husband and I arrived early to head to the bar for a drink before our reservation.  I ordered a margarita, and loved the extra shaker that went along with it - nice touch!  The group arrived and we headed to the patio, which was made quite warm by the heaters.  We started with one order of the Chorizo Fundido, and were brought two big bowls of chips and salsa to go along with it.  Word on the street was that it was delicious, but as a vegetarian I withheld.  A little while later, we were served some yummy warm tortillas and butter - a nice treat!    There aren't many vegetarian options.  I was able to ask for the tacos with extra black beans instead of the meat, and our server was extra accommodating.  It came with 3 small tortillas and a plate full of lettuce, guac, beans, tomatoes, and rice.  It was good....but a little pricey for what it was.    Overall, this was an A-Ok restaurant but our server made it a Yay!  He was friendly and helpful.  He was professional.  He offered, pleasantly, to split checks for our group of 8 and even knew who was together.  Kudos to him!",

It was nice to wander the local art galleries during our wait time.  Food was decent.  I have no complaints, but I found myself wondering if any of the other patios that we'd past, may have had better more unforgettable foods on the menu.  Oh well.  P.S.

Munched on the chips and salsa for a bit. I decided on the margerita chicken which was not what anyone who ordered it expected. The \"stuffed chicken breast\" is actually 4-5 pieces of chicken that are stuffed/rolled. In any event, it wasn't AMAZING, and the people who got the pork and salmon off of the menu seemed much more pleased then the chicken diners.

It was almost tex-mex and not truly a \"mexican\" enchilda, but it was still tasty! The sauce had just the right amount of kick, the tortilla appetizer was delicious, and our server was friendly and gave us space. I'd definitely recommend it as long as you keep in mind that it's not TRULY mexican food...  The only thing I would change?

    "text": "Went to the Factory thinking that it was going to be some great place that gives you beans and rice for some spectacular tortillas.  One would be lead to think since they are called \"The Tortilla Factory\".  But this wasn't the case.  As someone stated below the tortillas are your starter.  They give it to you in place of chips and salsa, or bread and butter.    Looking at the menu we really didn't see what we thought we were going to see, we got some recommendations from the staff and ended up with Meatloaf (very good by the way) and a dried out pork chop that was covered in a chipotle raspberry sauce (gave me a great idea for my next BBQ) they stated this dish was there best/fav. dish.    Very overpriced.  Margaritas that can run you from $8-$35.  Yeah it was good (I got the $10 marg.) and would have loved to ordered another, but we still had to pay for the food.  Overall, I would go back knowing what to expect.  We would order less and eat more of the free tortillas and salsa.  We could have even shared an entree, and gotten some appetizers.  The entrees were large and we had take home.  The flavors of the food were terrific.  The meatloaf was wrapped with bacon.....tasty....",

That's Mexican?  It was very weird.  I had  the quesadillas, which were filled with vegetables and very tasty, but they should have grilled it more since the cheese wasn't fully melted.  The portions were a good size, and flavors were good, but not fabulous.  The tortillas with butter are a bit confusing to me.  What am I supposed to do with it?  Eat it like a piece of bread?  I'm a Midwesterner, so you might have to explain it a bit to me.  Our server was fantastic (and adorable).  He checked on us just the right number of times, and was friendly without being overbearing.",

They were the only part of the meal I didn't care for, and didn't even end up needing since they eventually brought out their fresh and flavored tortillas that they pair with flavored butter. The tortillas of the night were black bean flavored and were paired with chipotle butter, both of which tasted amazing! I ordered enchiladas which were good, but nothing too special. The food was overall average but I'd probably come back solely for the cool night-time environment.",

Their sweet and sour mix taste like Sprite.  I am so surprised as to how this establishment in a nice area can offer such bad food.   The chips are out of a bag.  They are the low fat kind you buy from the grocery store.  Oh and you have to pay almost $5 for chips and salsa.  They use to serve a fresh flour tortilla and butter but thats no longer an option anymore.  I waited over 40 minutes for my entree.  By the time it came to my table I realized the wait staff forgot it.  The only saving grace was the sweet waiter.  This place is a major tourist trap and they apparently can get away with charging people over-priced dishes and watered down drinks because of their location.  Do yourself a favor and skip on this restaurant.  I promise you will enjoy a better meal at Rubios or Taco Bell.",

I came out with a taste of delicious fresh tex-mex, well made drinks, and a GREAT dining experience.  Granted, I went to Tortilla factory early in the evening before they were busy.  The waiter spent ten minutes chatting with us, educating us on the menu, drinks, and cuisine.  His recommendations and interactions are what made the experience above and beyond.  My recommendation is to jump right into the traditional \"entree\" cuisine, even if you are in more of a greasy enchilada sort of mood.  Ask the waiter for his or her recommendations,  (I loved the pork), and even if it's hot, sit outside.  The ambience is well worth it.",

Tortillas were cold and tough to chew, the taco meat entree that came with rice and beans included, that I requested a vegetarian substitute, did not come with rice, which is beyond me in terms of reasoning.  I had even asked when i was ordering to make sure rice was included.  Fiance had the carne de fuego, which did not have any sides or tortillas with it, which we would have expected. Below average service, took 10 minutes of waiting after we were done before any one noticed to take our plates away.  Its a damn shame we had such a bad experience, as it is a nice looking property and we were thinking of possibly having our rehearsal dinner here.  Unfortunately, we won't be back.",

    "text": "I don't get all the bad reviews.  I popped in for dinner last night. Saturday. 7pmish. Yes, it was busy, and the wait was about 90 mins or so.  Our party went over to the bar and promptly sat down. This is where things could have become a bit of an issue. It was a bit of a clusterfuck in there. No servers, one bartender. We had no idea what we were supposed to do.  Wait at the table? Go to the bar and place an order?  Eventually, we were able to order our food and drinks. We summoned someone to come over and the service ended up being great from there.   We received our drinks and appetizer in a flash. We ordered the crab dip. It was tasty, but a little bland. Perhaps it needed salt....but it definitely needed a kick. Make sure to ask for a few hot sauces (cholula at a minimum). Also be sure to ask for chips and salsa. It seems like this is by request only.  The crab dip came with just six chips. Kind of sad. Oh well.  Like I said though....the speed of service and general attitude whenever we needed refills and whatnot was good. This made up for the potentially disastrous start to the evening.  We were eventually seated at our table in the patio. Oh yeah. Don't ever come to this place and sit inside. It's a waste. Trust me....I am usually the kind of guy that prefers sitting inside.  The patio is dimly lit, is very romantical. Perfect for a date....if you are brave enough to take a date to a mexican place.  Service was no issue from here on out. So if you read all the other reviews and see notes on bad service....you heard it from me. Mr. Elite Yelper. The service was great.  While the server took our order, she brought out red pepper tortillas with garlic butter. Nom.  I ordered the Carne De Fuego. Tender pieces of steak in a honey chipotle sauce, with peppers, onions. Garnished with a green chile pepper that was stuffed with a mashed sweet potato.  The food was VERY good. Everyone seemed to really enjoy their meal. I heard no complaints.  Also, our server was pretty friendly. Made good conversation and even took our photo at the end of it all.   A great night, with great food, but most importantly....great company.   Bring your friends. Bring your lady. Bring your man. Bring someone. It's worth sharing.",

(and $12 is pushing it)  The patio is very nice and I think would be both fun and fine for drinks, chips, guacamole, and salsa.  The Salsa is quite good.  If your planning to eat, go elsewhere!  However, that's about where it ends from our experience.  Tortilla factory's food didn't rate on par with even some of the taco carts around town (some of which are actually quite good, so it's probably in insult to the carts to compare them with this place).    We ordered the mole ribs.  The mole was not traditional and was very bad; ribs were dried out and cold.  I think maybe they made the mole early in the day, and then held it around.  The taste was sour, burnt, and harsh.  Not the subtle spice and flavor of a good mole.  We then went on to have several main dishes.. one of which was the green pork Chile Verde.  The presentation was awful and the dish looked washed out and very bad.   Think Alpo.   The flavors of the sauce as good but, the meat was dry and tough.  The other dish we had was a sweet honey steak dish.  The flavor was fair, presentation was decent however.  Overall, I'd have to say I felt sorry for the servers and anyone going here thinking that they are getting a taste of local fare.   Sadly, the food is a very poor representation of the city and its diverse southwestern/Mexican culture.  This restaurant has such potential due to its location, but, it's time to change out the chef or get a restaurant consultant in and refresh the menu for it ever to be taken seriously for anything but drinks on the patio.   If you want good southwestern fusion fair in old town Scottsdale, try \"The Mission\" on the other side of Scottsdale road and just a couple blocks south or Barrio Cafe in central Phoenix.",

When I asked the hostess politely why there were so many open tables she replied by saying \"sir...I can't seat you\". I have never been to a restaurant that had so many open tables and still insisted on not seating us. I did see them seating parties of 2-4 people on the patio. Why couldn't they push 2 tables together for us?  As a former restaurant manager, I understand how seating is managed. This hostess seemed more amused by saying no than she was interested in offering a good dining experience. I have been to Old Tortilla Factory several times over the years and the quality of service and overall attitude has continued to decline. Needless to say, I will not ever return. Sad.",

The outdoor seating area is very nice, there is a roomy bar and fairly large indoor restaurant (I agree with Sarah K., bring a sweater).    The Chorizo Fundido is delicious!!  They serve it with a large bowl of chips.  I always ask for a side of soft corn tortillas too, they are a nice change from the chips.   The Plato Appertivo is gigantic, you could feed four people with this thing.  The nachos, ribs and quesadillas were all fantastic.  There is a generous scoop of their great guacamole on top and a bowl of salsa on the side.  You might want to ask for the chipotle sour cream on the side rather than on the quesadillas - it has a great smoky taste but can dominate easily so I prefer to regulate the portion.  The enchiladas and soft tacos are very good.  Their flour tortillas are great (when they bring them).  Margaritas were excellent and generous for the price.  Service can be spotty.  If you're in a rush or are frustrated by slow service to the point it impacts your food enjoyment, this place may not be your cup of tea.  I enjoy the food/drinks so I go when I know I have the time to be patient.  Test it out during a leisurely happy hour and see what you think.",

    "text": "Old Town Tortilla Factory's patio and outdoor ambiance is beautifully romantic. On a perfect Arizona evening in the spring or fall, it's an excellent spot to enjoy the comfortable climate. One star awarded.   But if you do anything besides sit on the patio, you will be disappointed. Four stars deducted.     Our server took our order after we had been seated for about 10-15 minutes. Then it was like she completely forgot that she had to actually bring us our margaritas and food. Total space cadet. We asked for things, like waters, that never came.   Call me crazy, as most people do, but I was also highly irritated by the fact that the chips and salsa here are not complimentary. That's something I expect from a Mexican dining destination. For the top shelf pricing, they could at least throw in a measly chip and salsa bowl on the house. Yeah, their tortillas with cubes of butter are supposed to replace the chips and salsa...... but tortillas and butter? Methinks not. Methinks that I'd much rather have chips and salsa!  The food is mild to bland, yet it costs a pretty peso. I ordered the \"El Tesoro Del Mar\" - a salad (consisting of mostly iceberg lettuce ick), spicy honey chipotle dressing (waaaaay too sugary with too little spice), pico de gallo, corn, black beans, tortilla strips and large gulf shrimp (only 4 shrimp!! and they were hardly large, more like small to medium sized!!). This disappointment of a dish cost about $15. Overrated. I can honestly say I've had a much tastier shrimp salad at Baja Fresh, for half the price and double the shrimp nonetheless.   I tired some of the enchiladas that Matt ordered, and they tasted forgettable at best. I've had better enchilada sauce from a store bought can. And then my mother, who was in town visiting for the weekend, ordered the grilled salmon. She was so unimpressed by the meal that she didn't even finish it... and she always finishes her food. It takes a lot of skill to mess up something like a grilled salmon.   As far as their margaritas go, they are good but with the $8.50 to $11 price tag I'm just not convinced that they are worth it. I've had better margaritas at places with better menus. I can honestly say that after eating here once, I have ZERO desire to ever go back.",

    "text": "I've been so excited to try this restaurant and finally did this week. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment and probably one of the worse places I've ever eaten. This includes food and service. Our server, Mike, was horrible and inattentive. Perhaps because he was so young and had little if any experience serving. Don't get me wrong he seemed like a nice kid just horrible at customer service. We stared with the chicken lettuce wraps which sounds refreshing with chicken, strawberries, and pecans but were served drenched in dressing and the chicken tasted as if it came from a can. I had one bite and my husband ate the rest only cause he is always the nice one and doesn't believe in returning food cause he said they just throw it away and that's a waste. For dinner I ordered the pork chili. Mike said it was one of his favorites??? A bowl of shredded dry pork with some diced potatoes arrived. For $17 I expected a bit more. I had one bite and no more. Mike our server must have walked by us at least 5 times and never stopped to ask how anything and when he did he asked if I wanted a to go box. Sure why not I got two dogs at home. Wouldn't you wonder if something was wrong if your customer barely touched their meal. Oh well $76 later and I can take the Tortilla Factory OFF my list for good.  Please save your money and time and go elsewhere.",

We knew we would pay for chips and salsa so that wasn't a big deal and the basket of chips was huge. The salsa was good but I wanted it with a little more spice so I asked Sydney, our server, if they had anything with a little more kick. She brought out some habanero sauce and I just added it to the pico de gallo.... just right and good flavor! When we chose our entree I asked Sydney for a few suggestions and she was spot on.. our food was flavorful and delicious. The service was terrific ( we split a margarita to start our meal and she brought out 2 frosty glasses so we'd each have our glass) we had ordered a beer to go with our meal and they arrived just as they served our entree. Enjoyed the experience and would go back!",

While heading to the restroom to clean food off, she was confronted and yelled at by what turned out to be ladies related to staff and management. One lady went as far as physically shoving me while I told the group that they had no right or business to talk to my young child. The management handled the situation extremely bad when they acted to escalate the situation by confronting another person in my party instead of diffusing things and cleaning up the accident. Obviously a family operation that has lost sight of the importance of the importance of the customer.",

We ended up trying what seems like everybody and their madres recommended here on yelp which was their dish called Carne De Feugo! It was super tasty and fulfilling and was one of the cheaper dishes on the menu at $16 but totally worth it to me and Lindsey. The only reason we're giving it a four star was because this place is not going to satisfy your craving of Mexican food or atmosphere, but don't get me wrong it's super delicious food and the outdoor patio with all the lights and the unique fire fountain gives you a lot to talk and gawk about during your stay at the Tortilla Factory! Our waiter was increible and gave us stupendous service so it was an all around great experience here! 8.5/10",

If you want some awesome food with a Tex-mex flair then come here and you will be MUY BUEN!!!! Beautiful atmosphere, gorgeous twinkle lights, and cool outdoor patio seating...Now DONT come here if your looking for your traditional Mexican fiesta with the perfect enchilada, chips and salsa or taco....  chips and salsa was bleh (and also cost $6), my grandma was not satisfied with her enchilada and instead of chips and salsa you can expect a plate of freshly made tortillas with butter (again, delicious- but not what I expect when I think a traditional Mexican meal) if you want some True blue Mexican food go somewhere else--- if you want a fun night with a Tex mex twist and a fun atmosphere in awesome old town Scottsdale come here!",

They had chips and salsa on the table when we got there- decent.   We got to pick between chicken, filet, and ribs. I picked the filet- it was juicy but still kind of tough to chew. My co- worker got the ribs and they were huge- huge stack. The food was average overall but they gave a huge quantity of it.  They also brought out their house made tortilla with butter.   Service was really good but food was just average.  I wasn't super impressed by any of the items I consumed. Margaritas were pretty sugary.",

Although the tortillas were very unique (I have never had flavored tortillas before) they fell short of our expectations. Our server, Mina, was great and she did a fantastic job and was very attentive to our needs. The margaritas were good and I really liked the tortilla soup and chicken salad I ordered. My friend ordered the diablo shrimp and she said it was just ok. My wife ordered the shrimp cocktail and, again, it was just ok. Finally, my buddy ordered the Maui tacos and he said they were average. I don't know what else to say except we were really expecting the food to be better than ok.  The best thing about our experience was the service that Mina, our server, provided. And the patio was really nice but it was too hot to eat outside.  I asked everybody in my group if any of them would eat here again and sadly each one of them said no.",

Cut night short soup/appetizer/dessert.  Tortilla soup was cold, the Chicken Flautas were good once you scraped the excessively hot, not mild as described, Mole sauce off of them, the chocolate cake was huge and delicious as described. They compt'd the cake for us due to the circumstances. In all fairness mediocre food, convention like atmosphere, friendly staff.

More than that, the food is fantastic.  We started with the flautas appetizer with mole. Some of the best mole ever. I ordered the tortilla soup and mahi mahi tacos for dinner. The tortilla soup was perfectly seasoned and had great layers of flavor. My coworkers loved their dishes too.  The complimentary bread was jalepeno flavored tortillas which are definitely their claim to fame. Fresh from the oven and yummy with butter. We also shared the flan dessert. It had great flavor and texture, plus it was surrounded by strawberries and almonds.  I can't wait to come back when I am town!",

The margaritas are delicious (could probably use a little more tequilla..but i like to taste the alcohol), and the tortilla's they give you are really good too.

I love the overall look of the place but will not be going back for a long time, hopefully they hire new Managment and servers soon.",

Not the most amazing food, but we like the location and atmosphere and we like trying to support non-chain restaurants. But that is all based on the premise of good service.  We showed up last night 20 minutes before the posted closing time. We stated that we knew we only had twenty minutes and just wanted dessert. The hostess told us that they were having a problem with their system and could not accommodate us. I found that weird (what kind of a computer system do you need to bring out a slice of chocolate cake?), and then she added to the white lie that they had actually decided to close an hour early because of the problems with their system. At this point the restaurant is about a third full. Very confusing and maddening as we had driven very far out of our way to go there.  Unfortunately, we will never return.",

    "text": "I've got to add to the chorus of one and two-star reviews for this place. Another Scottsdale establishment that's faaaaar too pricey and waaaay too full of itself to justify the median price of $11 for margaritas (mine was served in a small, 10 oz. glass, and was mediocre. And don't even get me started on the food menu - which I gladly passed on, though I could have eaten).   The atmosphere in the daytime is blah to average at best, with a gaggle of servers all congregating and giggling amongst themselves too busily to distract for something called...\"service\". And, servers? Listen up...never, ever address your valued customers as \"buddy,\" or 'bud\". It's plain condescending. That's \"sir\", or the name on my gold card. And your server's salary is much too jeopardized to be smirking your way through your Tom Cruise in Cocktail trying-to-impress-the-girls-not-the-customers fantasy...okay, bud? That's why you got a 12% tip tonight. Oooooh, I know it hurts, but you need to shape up and read a book called \"Customer Service for Beginners\", grow up and step into the real world, bud.  Alternative to night out at Douche Factory: grab some Fresh and Easy tortilla chips and awesome restaurant-style salsa, a sixer of Corona, some fajita fixins and a friend, and settle in for an actually ENJOYABLE evening - all for about a fifth of the cost (or less) of this sorry-ass place.",

She had never been to Arizona before and we had spent the day walking around Tempe and Scottsdale.  We just ordered drinks and appetizers because it was 104 that day, and she didn't want to eat anything heavy. We had their chorizo nachos which was delicious with fresh jalapenos, cotija cheese sprinkled on top and crema, instead of sour cream. We loved it along with the guacamole dip. My only complaint was that there was inside seating available along with the patio where we were seated. We should have been offered a choice, but we weren't. It wasn't the server's fault. The blame lies squarely with hostess.",

He even claimed it is better than San Diego's Mexican, which I cannot agree with ;)  So, we went before I checked Yelp.... The patio is GORGEOUS. I took pictures, it was like a fairy tale land. The waitress was on top of it! Everything she suggested was awesome. We got the margarita that she said was the least sweet and oooh let me tell you, it was Uh-Mazing! She suggested the queso dip and that was another winner with nice big pieces of bean and tomato. I had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. if you like enchiladas GO FOR IT!!! So Good.  One thing I will say is that it is a little pricey. Work was paying for it but I definitely wouldn't have gone all out like we did if I had to pay, call me cheap... whatever... hatas gonna hate!

Bar service was great, we sat at the bar and the the bartenders were quick, friendly and efficient.  We had chips, salsa and guacamole with our cocktails.  We were called to a table after about 15 minutes and were very surprised.  The table was a tall cocktail table in the breezeway with tall bar stools to sit on.  However the table was barely large enough to hold our chips, salsa and drinks we brought from the bar.  The whole experience was very un comfortable.   We had both the red and green enchiladas and the taco platter.  The green enchiladas were ok but not great.  The red enchiladas lacked flavor and we could not finish it.  Taco platter was probably the best.  Lots of things to add, shrimp, chicken and steak. The biggest problem was putting three people on a dinky cocktail table.  For the price the food was less than we anticipated.",

On both occasions I've dined here we passed the time with drinks and appetizers at the bar.  If you sit inside for pre-dinner libations, bring a sweater--the a/c is cranked up and it gets quite chilly.    After finding a table at the bar we had to wait for our [nonexistent] waitress to come take our drink orders...but the Tortilla Factory redeemed themselves.  Our drinks came out in record time, as did our crab dip.  I wasn't impressed with this dish--definitely not what I was expecting crab dip to be.  Definitely ask for extra chips and salsa (and some hot sauce...the salsa isn't spicy at all).   The waitress later came by to apologize; the poor girl was running around servicing over 15 tables by herself!    The 90 minutes quickly passed and we were soon seated on the expansive patio.  It's so intimate and the service is friendly and prompt.  I had the shrimp salad.  The prawns were huge and tender--charred to perfection.  The greens were crisp and plentiful.  The cilantro dressing was AMAZING.  Just the right amount of food.   This is one of my favorite restaurants in town because of the unique touches: fresh, house-made tortillas with garlic butter...candlelit dining...a fountain with blazing fire...delicious food...AND unpretentious people!  Definitely a world of its own.   If you're in Scottsdale, you MUST visit this restaurant!",

Our friends had a deal chicken that they were using, which is the only reason we came here.  After reading the reviews on Yelp, I wasn't too excited about going, to say the least.  As others have said the decor and ambiance at the restaurant is great.  Contrary to what others have said, our service was excellent.  Our server was knowledgable and friendly and the service overall was fast and accurate.  I had the carne de fuego, and it was excellent.  The steak was cooked perfectly, and the flavors blended very well.  My wife had the mahi mahi tacos, and those were very good as well.  And I couldn't stop eating the fresh tortillas with butter.  It wasn't all great though.  Our friends got desserts, and gave us one to take home with us.  It tasted like it had been sitting around for a while, and also previously frozen.  I wouldn't recommend getting the dessert here, given the low quality of the cheesecake.  Overall, the prices aren't terrible given the quality of the food, but they're not great either.  They are a little too high.  I can't quite give Tortilla Factory 5 stars, but if you're in the area, give it a try, you might like it.",

    "text": "We went to Tortilla Factory on Tuesday, which you would think it would be dead right? WRONG? It was packed! We were told March (because of spring training) is one of their busiest months. This is my first time there! Our family arrived before my husband and I  (a little before our reservation at 645PM) and they waited about 5 or 10 mins and were sat. When we got there, they were already sat. Trying to get a parking spot is a joke and they do not have valet. We drove around for about 10 minutes until we found a spot, finally in a dark unlit area. That is my main complaint. Their parking lot is soooo tiny, for how large the restaurant is, I was surprised. We were greeted by a young smiling girl (who knew right where our other 4 ppl were at) and brought us to our table outside on the NON smoking patio. That is a huge plus for me. So many spots in AZ. are now allowing smoking on their patios during dinner! YUCK! I dont want to smell someones nasty cigarette OR cigar while eating. I think they might have another patio that is smoking, but not sure (The sign said MAIN patio is non smoking).  Now for service. Keely was a our waitress who was great. She was friendly and quick at her job. She was slammed and still made us have a good dinner. My father in law ordered the large sampler thing with nachos, quesidillas and ribs on it. It was decent. The ribs were kind of bland. I didnt try the quesidillas, because I heard they were really spicy. The nachos were underneath everything on the bottom, those were decent. I wasnt too impressed with any of it. I ordered the chips and salsa and it was awesome. I liked it, because it was not spicy and I could eat it, but had great flavor as well. The guys ordered beers and us ladies had non-alcoholic beverages so not sure how their Margs are, but as I could see many people ordered them, so they must be good. Their bar has a million diff. bottles of tequila lined up, so if you are in the mood for tequila, you can prob get anything you want.  We all ordered the same thing pretty much, two of us got red enchiladas pretty good. Nothing too special, but good. 3 got Build your own tacos, you get shrimp, chicken and steak.. A little weird because you have to pay extra for cheese and sour cream, you get guacamole, lettuce and pico. Dont ALL tacos come with cheese? lol Seemed weird. They all liked it tho. Lots of food that is for sure. The last person got a shrimp salad and she liked it. Almost all the way done with the meal my mother in law said they usually give flavored tortillas as a starter. She asked if they had any? Keely brought out Cilantro maybe? they were bland and had no flavor. I was full anyways, but I wanted to try it. For a company that has the word TORTILLA in their name you would think it would be amazing ya know? It was my father in laws bday so we got some deserts. I was so stuffed didnt even eat half my dinner. I did try some of the cheesecake we ordered it was regular with raspberry drizzle. AMAZING. They also got a piece of choc cake, they said it was great! It looked like it could serve a part y of 10. It was HUGE! All in all, I would give the food a 3 out of 5 stars. BUT Keely was such a great server I had to up it to 4. Keely did tell us that the weekends are crazy busy and there usually is a longer wait, so for people that had a long wait I would advise to go back in during the week. The patio also had a fountain and heaters. It was so nice out there, I could have just sat outside for hours.",

    "text": "I pretty much agree with the lukewarm reviews.  This is another case of style over substance.  Old Town Tortilla Factory is to Sonoran what Sassi is to Italian, except where Sassi gets 5 stars for ambiance and 3.5 stars for food and to me is worth the price, OTTF gets  3.5 stars for ambiance and 2 stars for food and isn't worth the price.  So I think I'm being generous with the 3 star rating.  After reading the yelp reviews I made sure to not get my hopes up, but before leaving Boston my co-workers gave me a gift card here so I had to give it a shot.    On to my particular experience. . .   The outdoor seating is very nice, but I wish the chairs weren't plastic.  Plastic works at brunch on a farm, not dinner in Scottsdale.  And I still can't believe how many heaters they had going at full blast, it was a calm 62 degrees when I was there.  If you get cold, throw on an alcohol jacket.    Which is what my husband and I proceeded to do.  He had the Treasure Margarita - at first he balked at $11.25 but they give you a shaker to pour it yourself so it comes out to be like 1.5 - 1.75 drinks.  He liked it very much, but laughed when I had said another reviewer had called them \"sublime\".  I had a sauvingon blanc which had a funny taste to it.  Meh.    Instead of bread and butter, there gimmick is, as you would guess, fresh house made tortillas.  When the waitress brought ours out she remarked that the spread was a cilantro butter, then proceeded to open the tortilla holder and said, \"Oh, and the tortillas are cilantro flavored. . .they make new flavors all the time so I guess this batch was cilantro. . .\"  Quick hint to OTTF - if you're serving cilantro butter, skip the cilantro flavored tortillas.  The tortillas were very good no doubt sans extra cilantro flavored butter.    We started with the Chorizo Fundido which was nothing special.  It was a bit too creamy (think sour cream) and not cheesey enough, certainly not the Queso Guillermo at El Encanto which is a bowl of melted cheesey goodness.    Since I'm sort of a wimp when it comes to spice, and considering nearly every dish is marked with a \"spicy\" chili logo, I asked the waitress how spicy the Chicken Calabacitas were.  She said that they are very safe with their \"spicy\" designation and none of the dishes have overpowering spice.  \"It's not like you'd need a sip of water after every bite.\"  I trusted her unfortunately, and was disappointed that I needed a sip of water after every 2 bites.  Besides the spice, the dish was good and bountiful.  My husband ordered the Pork Chile Verde and was disappointed at how tough and chewy it was.    The highlight of the meal was when we paid with the $75 gift card for the $67 meal (being so underwhelmed, we were willing to forfeit the additional $8 without getting anything else).  The waitress came back, apologized that she couldn't get the gift card to run properly, so instead of being left with $8 on the card she just gave us a new $10 card.  Of course, this now means we'll have to go back. . .at least for a drink. .",

I thought the courtyard was nice if a little run down (could use a re-fresh).  We  had good service until we were ready for our check - it had gotten busy so we had to flag down our waiter.  The food was just mediocre; not enough spice and flavor.  My daughter had a gargantuan plate of nachos that were just mediocre, nothing special.  I had the shrimp tacos that were flavorless, the corn tortillas were like cardboard and there was no white creamy sauce that's usually served on tacos - rather disappointing.  The best thing we ate were black bean tortillas and herb butter that were not even part of the menu and served as a pre-meal bread.  I wish I had eaten only the black bean tortillas and butter!  This looks like a place that had its' hey-day once and now are just old and tired of it all.  I think it could be brought back with new menus, some bright updated decor, and new management/owners.  We don't have to try this place again; I'm pretty sure the people that really like this place have had a few margaritas before dinner.",

    "text": "A beautiful little oasis spot in a gorgeous location, this restaurant has survived off word of mouth for ages. My sister nominated this place to me as having the best Margaritas back before I was old enough to drink. Sadly, today this place is a mere shadow of its former self (if a place can have a 'self').   Today, the Margaritas taste like they came from a mix you could by at the grocery store. Much of the food is sub-par and tastes pretty bland... there is talent behind the scenes though. Management just chooses to cut corners to save money. Honestly, this place could really be magic. It's a good candidate for Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares. Especially considering that word of mouth is dwindling on this joint. It barely gets by on walk-in business from out-of-towners staying across the street at the Valley Ho, but even this won't last.   A friend of mine works here (as does or did the short and slightly douchey Mike from the Paradise Hotel 2 reality show) and even admits that the place isn't doing well. It's really a shame because like I said, this was once a place that earned its word of mouth praise which was literally heaped on at one time.  As it is, this place is merely okay... the ambiance is better than the food, but it's not horrible. The only reason I suggest staying away is because I hope someday they turn it around and make it worth going again so that I can truly recommend it. If you do go, please tip generously. ;) Best times to go are early evenings in the spring or fall or on only the coolest of Arizona summer days.",

(there were four of us at the table, I am glad not more I would hate to think how long that would have taken)  The food.... while the menu looked good and the food sound appealing , although a little on the pricey side for what it was... when it came out I don't think it could have got much worse...  I order a chicken dish that was poached... I think that my napkin would have had more flavor in it... I am certain that it was just cooked in plain water and all of the flavor that might have existed in the chicken was left in the poaching water, I know that it wasn't in the chicken that I was severed... my wife ordered a dish she ask is this spicy? she was told not at all.... I would have liked to ask the server what their meaning of not at all is, if only I could have found him and kept him at the table away from his phone long enough to ask... I like spicy food as does my wife, but we could not eat it.... a-la Guy Fieri, Triple D, atomic chicken wings... I think that they put quite an amount of habanero if not bhut jolokia in it... fun thing was though they forgot the salt or anything else that might have resembled flavor.... my sons ordered fried chicken strips.... I think that they were left in the frier just short of becoming shoe leather... if they were trying to bring visions of the Sonoran Desert they did with the chicken strips!  From reading Yelp these guy are just all over the place... sometimes good... sometimes you get them like us.... I would like to hope that it was nothing we did to upset them.... if it was us I am sorry that we upset you that much!  The only good thing was they were able to serve the beer cold... it was the only the got right all night...  Oh when we went to complain... well good luck finding a server... paid... left... disappointed",

    "text": "My mouth is watering just thinking of the fluffy floured freshly made tortillas.  The tortillas along with their cilantro butter are nothing short of amazing. And they should be.  I mean, it IS called the Old Town Tortilla Factory, so they had better be delicious.    Other than that and the expansive twinkle-lit patio, there's nothing to really write home about here.  I found myself here twice in the past week so I was able to enjoy some great patio dining.  It seems like every Mexican/ Southwestern restaurant says they have the best margarita in Arizona.  OTTF makes that claim on the back side of their menu, along with a litany of other awards mostly from Citysearch.  City what?  City who?  The award-winning Treasure margarita looked impressive and robust presented with the shaker - providing an extra drink or so.  The taste was not anything out of this world like I expected.  The patio is really huge and makes up probably 70 percent of all the seating in the establishment abutting the quaint historic adobe home - meaning fall and spring are definitely the times to go here.  But the green plastic chairs - gahh!  A charming and impressive patio is diminished by the cheap picnic ambiance the chairs emit.  The food is ok.  The first time I had the Poblano de Mariscos -- stuffed poblano peppers filled with crab, cream cheese, herbed butter, roasted corn, diced red bell peppers with a shrimp cream sauce. The reality?  Stuffed peppers with mostly cream cheese and a smattering of crab flakes.  I couldn't even taste the crab.  The second time I ordered the tortilla soup and it wasn't all that great either.  It was more red than orange and had more chicken and not enough tortilla than I have had elsewhere.  It's ok if that the way you like it, but I will pass.    The salsa was the worst though.  Mostly a red tomato sauce with bit of chile included.  It was the most mild and un-spicy salsa I have EVER had in my life.  I think Pace mild sauce is hotter than this stuff. Since I was with my friend Maya and a friend visiting from Queens, I was shouting \"New York City?!\" - mocking the old Pace commercials.  Maybe they accidentally served us Ragu.  Who knows? All was fine once we asked for habanero sauce to spice it up.   2.5 stars overall. 5 stars for the tortillas.",

This is a great place to go with a group of friends to get the \"old town\" party started.  Overall good food, nice atmosphere, fair prices, and an amazing location.",

It was so bad it was hysterical!  Service was absolutely 3rd world!  The nerdy waitress had the nerve to overcharge our table $40.  The manager stumbled out bellowing, \"What's your problem now?!\"   \"FIRST OF ALL, we aren't pleased with the food and the waitress overcharged us.\" I retorted.  \"Well get out, we're closing in 20minutes anyway!\" he snickered.  Long story short --- this place is an overrated outhouse.",

    "text": "I would not consider this Mexican food but they sure do make a delicious tortilla and a yummy margarita that comes with a shaker to top off your glass throughout your meal. I sat on the patio on a normal 108 degree July evening in Phoenix and even the misters were not strong enough to battle the heat.  My skin kept sticking to the cheap plastic patio furniture when I would try to move.  The ambiance made up for all of that. It took a while for the server to come over and take a drink order but I was given an extra large glass of water as soon as I was seated so at least I stayed hydrated while waiting for my Mrs. Sames Original Margarita.  I ordered the Old Town Tacos w/o shrimp.  Took a while for it to come out and they don't bring out complimentary chips/salsa ($4.99 on the apps menu) so my Margie kept me company. The plate finally came out piled high with steak, chicken, black beans, rice, lettuce, pico de gallo and guacamole.  They also bring out flavored tortillas and butter with the meal which they say is their version of bread and butter - could have used them around the same time an Italian restaurant serves their bread and butter.  Anywho, tonight's flavor was cheddar cheese tortilla with a sour cream and chive butter.  They were really good.  As for the taco plate, the steak was good but too smokey flavored to eat on its own.  It was just right when wrapped up in a tortilla with all the other fixin's. For dessert, I had the banana crisp with blackberry compote.  It was good but nothing to write home about. The cinnamon covered tortilla that the bananas were wrapped in could have been crispier and the blackberry compote did not have enough flavor.  The compote would have also been better if it had been served warm.  The whole thing was just too mushy for me.  The one thing they got right with this dish was the presentation. It was so pretty that I took a picture before I took a bite. One more thing they could improve on - the music.  It was a step up from elevator music.  Not what I want to hear at a dinner table. The end.",

Dana is a fantastic waiter! Going back again tonight! Sit outside in the patio! Heaters if you get cold. Barratt Jackson visitors need to dine here!!!",

    "text": "Warning: My review might be jaded because I had just had amazing Mexican food at Dick's Hideaway (yum!) just the night before.    The outdoor patio lighting was nice, but failed to give us the romantic atmosphere we were hoping for.  It also kept starting to rain on us.  One additional star for the waiter for being super willing and nice and able to find us an indoor table that we passed on 3 different times.  I love Mexican and Tex-Mex, but this restaurant was sub-par.  We had the appetizer sampler platter.  The santa fe roll was weird.  I dont like that the shredded/mashed beef was cold.  The flavor was just weird. The cheese sauce on the nachos was decent, as well as the pico de gallo that came on top. The ribs were okay, and were served room temperature.  The quesadillas were also just okay.  I was confused by the pablano pepper tortillas and butter they brought out.  I didn't know what to do with them.  Tried the butter on the tortilla.  Tasted like regular tortilla.    I couldn't find the stuffing in my stuffed filet mignon.  It was just an 'okay' steak.   For dessert we had the flan.  The almond liqueur gave it a good kick and was a good differentiating factor.  The slivered almonds was nice.  Sorry, but I won't come back.  There are plenty of other good & better Mexican restaurants in the area.",

They took us to a seat that was outside as there were many empty table we said thanks. The waiter Mike came to our table and said even though you are not supposed to be seated here I will take care of you. He was rude, not our fault they sat us there. The service was terrible and the food was not good at all, a tourist restaurant. Never will go back",

    "text": "We've been here twice and both times we've had a good experience, the only reason why it's not 5 stars is that both times it took 10 minutes for someone to come to our table to get our order. We would get waters or our drinks, but then end up staring at each other since there was no waiter around.  I loved the house salad: field greens tossed with honey balsamic dressing, jicama, pico de gallo & mandarin oranges. Very fresh and nice blend of dark and light greens. Perfecto.  The Carne De Fuego entree was not bad, it was steak with chipotle honey sauce, good portions, I was stuffed at the end of the night!  Their Platinum margarita is delicious, I liked how they gave me whatever they couldn't pour in the margarita glass as well.  The outdoor patio dining area definitely made it a little more special for me and the hubs. Can't wait to come back!",

We generally do take out when we work late nights, and the food hasn't disappointed me yet.   The Nachos del Sol is great.. Tortilla chips topped with chorizo, pepperjack cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole,chipotle sour cream & jalapeno peppers with house salsa. (not appropriate for those sensitive to heartburn)   A healthier approach would be  the Tequila lime salad with grilled chicken. The dressing is a great touch and the flavors just mix well w/ the chicken and greens.  Last but not least- you must try the Chicken Tortilla soup. Thick, and sooo good with the touch of avocado and sour cream.   So next time you're looking for a different touch for take out- you should try Old Town Tortilla Factory",

    "text": "A group of us went to Old Town Tortilla Factory as a local recommended the place. We sat outside on the patio, and it was nice to feel the water mist.  The food is NOT worth the price. I shared a Green Chile Enchilada Stack ($12) and Pollo Margarita ($20) with two other friends. The entrees were not impressive. The enchilada had so much cheese on it and I could barely taste the tortilla and the chicken. The enchilada sauce didn't bring out any flavor to the dish. The Pollo Margarita was stuffed chicken breast with cheese and peppers. It was topped with tequilla citrus sauce, and included potato cakes and vegetables. The chicken was sooooo dry. For $20, I was expecting to eat excellent chicken.  In addition, we had to ASK for the homemade tortillas. Come on!! Since they are known to make the tortillas, I was expecting tortillas to be made constantly.  Eh, not a good restaurant.",
