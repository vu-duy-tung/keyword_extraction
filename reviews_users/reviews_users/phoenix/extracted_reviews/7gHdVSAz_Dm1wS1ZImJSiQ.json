They leave you with lots of room to adjust your order, so you can get just one half of the sandwich or both cookies. They also offer brownies for the sandwich, which looked great. I had the cookies and cream ice cream with chocolate chip cookies for my sandwich and a sprinkle topping. Would definitely recommend for a big dessert!",

I ordered the funfetti cookie sandwich with cake batter ice cream rolled in fruity pebbles. The cookies were soft and fresh and the ice cream was the perfect creamy consistency- so delicious! My husband got the peanut butter cookie sandwich with chocolate ice cream rolled in Heath bar, and my friend got the cookie of the month sandwich (Mexican hot chocolate) with mint chocolate chip ice cream! I had bites of both and they were equally as delicious. They have so much variety (tons of ice cream flavors that sound awesome, sandwiches that can be made with cookies, brownies, or donuts, and all sorts of toppings) that I'm certain there will be MANY visits in our future!",

I used to live down the street from where they put this gem but I'm happy (and sad) that I don't because I'd be visiting way too often! Actually I still go out of my way sometimes to drive up here lol. I've had a few of their cookies to which I've decided that red velvet is my absolute favorite. Their brownies are also scrumptious! I've topped every cookie/brownie with hot fudge and I die a little inside knowing that something as bomb as this is a zillion calories! You definitely get a lot for what you pay for an ice cream cookie sandwich here. They have a bigger selection of cookies than other shops I've tried too. EAT HERE! They are generous with their toppings :)",

Pretty easy to order, the menu is up and you can decide while waiting in line because that gives you PLENTY of time considering how long the line was. Choose your cookie, then your ice cream, then toppings (optional but $.50 each), then you can choose whether you want it hot pressed. I highly recommend because who doesn't like a warm cookie?! I tried a butter pecan ice cream sandwich between a peanut butter and snicker doodle cookie. AMAZING. My boyfriend got a brownie bear bowl with cookie dough ice cream. That was also to die for. I love brownies and that hit the spot! Only reason I docked a star is because of seating. I hear this place is always busy, but the reason I'm docking is because we went at 10pm at night on a Saturday and there were hardly any settings. We ended up sitting on a bench and let me tell you, it is not easy eating a cookie sandwich on a bench. You need TWO hands for those lol  Overall, if you have a sweet tooth then this is a must try!",

We've been here twice now, generally I'd try a place more times than that before giving a precious 5-star Yelp review, but I'm confidently in love.   Tips: 1. Get the brownie as at least one of your sandwich sides  2. Don't get it heated (it makes the cookie hard and doesn't really add much IMHO)  3. The ice cream in general is phenomenal, cookie dough is my favorite but I think I'll be trying Rocky Road next time  4. If you're willing to share, they're splittable, just ask for it to be cut in half. All the joy, only half the guilt.   Enjoy it!",

    "text": "I've longed for an ice cream cookie sandwich place, in AZ, ever since eating at one in Cali a few years back. Baked Bear answered that longing with a phat cookie sandwich that brought a tear to my dessert loving eye.  The concept is a simple. Pick a cookie, brownie or glazed donut for the 'bread' of your sandwich (you can also pick a cookie/brownie combo - no one initially told me this). Then pick your ice cream. You can also split flavors there (again I made this gem of a discovery on my own). Personally, I like the chocolate chip cookies, with half strawberry cheesecake ice cream and half cookie dough ice cream. Lastly, you pick your topping (for me, it is Fruity Pebbles for life). Once your sandwich is in your possession, you take your IG photo(s) and grub.   It's definitely legit. My first visit, I chuckled as there were 4 Coldstone employees in line in front of me. Kind of like seeing 4 Burger King employees in line at McD's.   It can be busy sometimes, and while I love eating ice cream cookie sandwiches, I do not heart waiting in line, so time out your arrival for non-peak times.",

You can ask to taste any ice cream you want before ordering, and don't forget that donuts are an option for ice cream sandwiches too!",

I get it, it's almost closing time but it would have been nice to not feel rushed, and asked if we wanted ours heated like the family in front of us. We were not offered any drinks, and my boyfriend actually wanted more added to his order and she kinda ran over to the register where I was standing while he was literally still standing there looking at the menu. He finally gave up, because we both are in the customer service industry and well, at that point we were just over it. Ice cream was a grade A. Hopefully the manager can install the \"do not rush people just because you close in an hour.\" I close the bar at 2am, sometimes I can leave a little after 2am and sometimes I can't even start my side work til after 2am. Don't know if we will track back over there to try this again anytime soon.",

Bred in San Diego and judging by the crowd level, it seemed like a convincing proposition to have.   I don't know how the lines are during the week but the weekend looked quite busy. If you arrive at night, you might see fog hovering around the entrance created from the water mist to help cool the eager crowd.  While cookie sandwich is the core concept, you can easily opt for a cone or a sundae.  As a first timer, we went traditional and got the chocolate chip ice cream sandwich! If you are not in the mood for cookies you can opt for brownies or even donuts!  There are a picking of flavors but one that stood out like a cactus on a hot summer day, was their Bear Batter flavor! If you love chocolate cake, this is for you! Each lick is a lick of cake.  It's quite delicious and tasty! Its bright blue color will make your yummy creation pop.  Additionally you can have them warm up the cookie sandwich before its served to you.  Don't worry the ice cream won't melt.  I too was worried about that.  Next time you think of Bears in the summer time or even winter, think of The Baked Bear.",

The first time I went I got their ice cream sandwich with a chocolate chip cookie on top and their seasonal cinnamon twirl cookie on the bottom, all stuffed with the bear batter flavored ice cream.The creaminess of the ice cream along with the pieces of fudge inside was delicious. I decided to hot press my sandwich which made the cookies warm and gooey when I took each spoonful in. I did not have to wait in line too long and it was definitely a hot Saturday afternoon. The service was also great and you can even try each flavor before choosing the one you actually want to purchase. I also tried the birthday cake, strawberry and chocolate flavors, which were all pretty good as well, but nothing beat that blue bear batter. The nice part is that they also serve free water to help with all that sugar!   This place was so good that I came back a couple days later with a friend to have him try it as well and I ordered the same thing except I switched out the cinnamon twirl cookie for the smores, which was also satisfying.   Overall, the flavors of the ice cream are great and I will definitely be back with some more friends!",

With the lines being so long, I was expecting to leave Baked Bear wanting more and to come again and again, but I was wrong. First off, the cookies that they used for the ice cream sandwiches didn't taste that fresh. I knew this due to the texture of the cookie. It was super hard and stale, and they ran out of a lot of cookies that we wanted to pick in the first place.   All the ice creams tasted alright. The best one was probably their most famous one, the blue ice cream, I think it's called like Cookie Monster flavor of something. I forgot, it was that unmemorable.   So also with this type of dessert, be prepared to cause a huge mess. The thing about just-prepared ice cream sandwiches is it won't hold its shape after the first bite. The cookie will break, the ice cream with start to melt everywhere, and you'll be forced to eat it in most sloppy way ever! I don't really like that kind of feeling after I'm done eating my dessert.   Overall, it's not worth the wait in line. It's just a trendy place that serves an alright dessert. The cookies were subpar, the ice cream was alright, the overall experience was not so great. I see the reviews and I'm kinda confused about them, cause I don't want to leave a negative review but it wasn't that great.   I'll have to go here again, and I'll edit my review accordingly.",

It does make your ice cream melt a tiny bit but it makes the cookie warm. However, if you're a slow eat, your cookie will get hard once it cools back down again. So eat it quick!",

    "text": "The hype is not real. Definitely underwhelmed with The Baked Bear when compared to ice cream sandwich shops such as: CREAM, Slickables or Milk. I'll just say the long line is not worth the wait.  The cookie selection is typical and so are the ice cream flavors. Think classic flavors. You can do an ice cream bowl (think Pizookie), donut sandwiches or ice cream cookie sandwiches. Decided to split a cookie ice cream sandwich with a friend and chose to mix and match cookies: Cinnamon Bun and White Chocolate Macadamia with their House ice cream, Bear Batter which is a cake batter dyed blue with brownie pieces. We got it warmed and split as well.  The cookies were underwhelming, crumbly and not warm at all. Definitely expected a soft, chewy and substantial cookie. As for the ice cream, it was icy and tasted freezer burnt. The artificial cake batter flavor was off putting and stains ones mouth blue. Definitely not good nor acceptable to be eating pieces of frost.   The interior is simple, with a vibe of being unfinished. There is however, lots of seating indoors and out on the patio area.  Didn't think The Baked Bear would lack in quality, but found it lacking. Not sure if it's poor execution since I know TBB has multiple locations in San Diego and San Francisco with stellar reviews.",

Do not plan on asking any questions about the menu, and make sure you have an easy order so they can follow or they will just give you a blank, confused expression, while trying to rush you along when there is no line at all behind you.   I ordered the bear batter ice cream (so good!) and had a red velvet cookie and funfetti cookie for the outside of the ice cream sandwich. I also got it heated up since other reviews stated the cookies are rock hard if it is not heated. The ice cream was really tasty and the cookies were soft yet chewy and flavorful.   I may go back in the future because I did enjoy the ice cream sandwich but still contemplating if it is worth the poor service and price.",

At Baked Bear the ice cream sandwiches are $3.95.  Baked Bear claims that they bake their cookies and are fresh, which they are pretty good. They also will heat press the cookie sandwich before serving to you.  Not much of a complicated process, get 2 cookies, place ice cream in between.   Priced at $3.95 a sandwich compared to $2.00 at the other place, the only trade off is I don't have to drive to Mill Ave from North Scottsdale.",

Peanut butter cookie and white chocolate macadamia nut with butter pecan and Heath bar bits  3. Chocolate chip cookie white chocolate macadamia nut salted caramel fudge ice cream with Heath bar pieces  The ice cream is rich and thick.  The cookies are satisfactory. The chocolate chip was similar to a basic  Toll House recipe. Which I find rather boring   The blandness of that type of cookie is a good platform for the ice cream   The strawberry cheesecake ice cream had chunks of strawberry cheesecake in it. The taste was excellent   The butter pecan was lacking in flavour ..... Would give that flavour a miss next time  The real winner was the salted caramel fudge ice cream. The caramel was so warm and inviting and then the super huge chunks of fudge were amazing.   The heath bar tipping added that extra toffee taste the was \"the icing on the cake\"  The fudge on the strawberry cheesecake combo didn't add much to the dessert. Also made it near impossible to pick up. Although ordered on the side (if possible ) and dunking the cookie ice cream creation sounds rather like a good option.   The servings are really generous and the three of us left with a sugar overlaid. Next time I am going to share one",

They make your ice cream sandwich and you can add toppings and/or choose to have them heat it up (like a p'zookie). They also have brownie options. Day old boxes of cookies (1/2 dozen and full dozen options) are for sale at a discount price. The cookies are amazing and it's always tempting to buy a box to bring home. You can eat inside, outside, or take it to go. They have lids for the containers if you choose the to-go option. Enjoy!",

You go in and order your cookies, you can order 2 of the same or one brownie, one chocolate chip, then you order your ice cream and up to two flavors and they have great ice cream, let me tell you! The cookies are warm, they put the ice cream in and make a sandwich and then you choose if you want your sandwich rolled in sprinkles or nuts or all these other delicious things or if you want any hot fudge, etc and voila, they give it to you!!!!!!!! You just want to die, it's so good. The first time you go, eat there because you must experience the warm cookies, ice cream , etc. Now I take them home, still good but not as good as eating there, fresh......Warning....there can be a very long line so be prepared to wait or go right when they open at 10am",

Cookies were soft and gooey, ice cream was lacking flavor but was ok overall. The wife got the cookie bowl with vanilla ice cream and enjoyed it.   If I'm nearby and craving ice cream, I'll be back in here. Otherwise I'll head to some other spots in town for great ice cream.",

Then pick out that ice cream filling and then finish it off with sprankles or toppings of choice. You can get it heated as well. And it's cheapppppp!

The girls working were killing it so they don't chit chat too much, prob because their main goal is to attack the line. Great job! Maybe get a couple more outside tables.

I found out what the real issue of the long line! It's not because the ice cream is really good, it's because the servers have no sense of urgency.  They take their time like not realizing there are about 50+ people outside waiting in the heat on a Saturday night!!  In fairness to the servers, I'm pretty sure they're probably very tired servicing all these people.  No where in sight do I see a manager or at least the owner managing the craziness of their place.

The cookie sandwiches are always amazing but I can only give 3 stars because on two separate occasions I paid the extra 0.50 for fudge and literally had a drop.

I finally had to add in the notes section on the GrubHub app \"please add fudge generously\"...honestly, for a ice cream place you would think I wouldn't have to say that.  Update: Although I still believe there should be more fudge, I thought it was awesome that the Owner reached out to me and apologized for the lack of fudge.

Unfortunately, all the hype we made for ourselves left us disappointed.  1. The cookies are extremely hard. Not easy to bite into until your ice cream has overly melted. The ice cream is fine, but the rock hard cookie needs some work.  2.They need a kids size portion or smaller portion size. For 4 sandwiches = $28 +change. I have a 4 year old. You bet your butt, he didn't eat 1/2 of his $7 ice cream cookie. My 12 year old couldn't finish his either, but it was a healthy attempt. For a sweet treat out for a family, I suggest sharing. 1/2 through, i wanted to be done with mine.   Overall, just not as enjoyable for a treat out. It was neat to go once, but I wouldn't be a repeat customer. There are plenty of store bought options that have softer cookies, smaller portions, more economical, and doesn't leave you feeling like you overpaid for a rock hard cookie sandwich.",

They have so many different combinations you can choose from - my mouth is watering just at the thought. Their selection ranges from creating your own cookie, donut, or brownie sandwiches to a delectable cookie or brownie bowl warming your ice cream from underneath. Surely a basic plastic cup is also a choice, but why opt for that? I am more than positive that I am leaving out a few more ways that your ice cream can be prepared, like as a sundae perhaps, but I made an attempt to include personal favorites. Each time I visit any of the Baked Bear locations I always manage to get a brownie bowl with bear batter ice cream.  You can't go wrong with whatever you get here, but you will more than likely leave wanting more. Don't forget that you can purchase day old cookies at the register and to ask for one of their stamp cards because believe me, you will be back.",

I was glad I did!  I walked inside and was greeted immediately by a sweet young lady.  I placed my order for a Combo Sandwich with cookie dough ice cream, and Heath bar pieces.  Paid the lady my money (just under $6.00), was handed my sandwich, sat down and dug in.  Here is how it was.........  Combo Sandwich- The combo sandwich includes a cookie of your choice (I chose chocolate chip) for the top, and a brownie for the bottom.  They put a massive scoop of cookie dough ice cream in the middle, and then roll it in Heath bar pieces.  Good lord, this thing was great!  The cookie was probably my least favorite part of the sandwich, but even then, it was still delicious!  The ice cream tasted great, there were tons of little Heath bar pieces, and the best part of the whole sandwich..THE BROWNIE!  They cook their brownies on a huge cookie sheet, and they are incredibly thin.  They are flat out delicious though!  These thin brownies are perfect!  Chocolaty, fudgy, crisp yet chewy.  Pretty much the perfect brownie.  Next time, I am bypassing the cookie, and just going with a brownie sandwich.  These things were awesome!    Overall, I am happy to have found this spot.  Ice cream is probably my favorite food in the whole world (followed closely by pizza), and this spot does it right!  Those brownies are to die for!  Dare I say, the best brownies I have ever had?  Damn straight!  Can't wait to come back to get a brownie sandwich!",

So when my employer decided to show us some love by way of ice cream sandwiches (hold the wheat bread and lettuce), I had very low expectations.  That being said, this was a mf-ing TREAT.  Snickerdoodle cookie, mint chocolate chip ice cream, brownie with rainbow sprinkles. The cookie was soft, the brownie was not too rich and held together nicely. I have zero complaints, even with the fact that it was transported to my office in a cup.   Enjoy your sugar high!",

    "text": "Unfortunately like the other Yelp Elite '17 reviews for this location, I too had a negative experience with this place.  Don't get me wrong: It's a novel idea, The Baked Bear, you choose your own \"sandwich breads\", you choose the ice cream, put some toppings on, all under a $10 price point, but man... The business offers so many options but offers so few TYPES of options.  What do you mean, you ask? Maybe it's the lack of advertised features that would cater to a more relevant audience amongst millenials. Where are the lactose-free options? Where are the almond/soy milk options? I get that these products typically require more process handling and paperwork in the food service industry, but if you're going to set up shop in a place like SCOTTSDALE of all places, why would you choose to alienate such a large portion of your potential customer base? Total business opportunity lost here.  For a business that advertises frozen desserts as their prime point of engagement (PPoE) with customers, I'm left scratching my head as to what the business lifecycle plans are for this place. The hype isn't real, it seems to lack visible foundation for business longevity.  Also:  -Why is their email address over 25 characters long? I checked online, there were definitely shorter domains available that'd be less of a PITA to type out. -Why are there multiple network SSID's for the Baked Bear and no obvious signage anywhere in the store that talks about wifi use for customers? If none for the customers, you need to re-label your SSID's accordingly so people are not thrown off by this. -Why is the lighting in this place so poor? It's 2017, the lighting style TBB currently chose is horribly dated.  If your employees are so completely out of touch that they lack the fundamentals of social bargaining platforms and its integration with point-of-sale (POS) systems, I question why the owners even turned to the Groupon platform. Why, you wanted to garner more business? If that's the case, you need to understand the platform and ensure SOP training is disseminated to employees before biting off more than you can chew. Otherwise, you get justifiably clueless employees, and worse, you get customers that get frustrated. Lines build up, customers talk, and as we say in the tech industry, \"Nothing is ever truly deleted off the Internet.\"  Speaking of chewing, when I came here, nothing on the menu indicates they have lactose-free options. So here I am, Groupons in hand, and I can't use any of them unless I want to land on a toilet all day. My date ended up using one of them, but I couldn't use any for myself nor my son; we are both lactose intolerant and the menu indicates no options that are lactose-free and their marketing is lacking at best.  All in all, unfortunately, some shoddy business implementation, poor marketing management, and lack of cohesive general business best practices makes me say \"Eek! Methinks not\" as Yelp labels one star reviews. The business just reeks of uninformed business decision after uninformed business decision.",

    "text": "Call me a traditionalist, but I'm not a huge fan of ice cream sandwiches made with cookies... If that's your thing, I think you'll really dig The Baked Bear. You are presented with an option of 8 or so types of cookies (or a brownie, or a combo of a cookie and a brownie, or even a donut), a dozen or so ice cream flavors, and various toppings to make your ice cream sandwich.  I was feeling butter pecan for my ice cream flavor, so what cookie pairs with that?  My daughter suggested snickerdoodles, and I don't think there would've been a better combo, but...  Had it 'topped' (more like rolled in, which really makes the most sense) almonds.  The ice cream was good, the topping was generous, as was the serving.  The ice cream, however, was too soft, so, whenever I tried to take a bite, it would squeeze out all the sides, leaving me, at the end, with a bunch of snickerdoodle that was free of ice cream.  (They even offered to heat the cookie, saying it wouldn't warm up the ice cream - I think a quick freeze to harden the ice cream would've made it easier to eat).  All in all, and novel experience.  Tasty ingredients.  Just not my thing.",

We walked in and we were quickly greeted. They explained how we could mix or match the cookies or brownies. I picked a funfetti cookie and snickerdoodle. Then we pick the ice cream and I was torn between the Apple pie ice cream and the birthday cake. She said I could do both that it's usually extra but this time she wouldn't charge the extra. She also told me they switch their flavors and apple pie might not be here next time. I also liked how she said how well it would pair with the snickerdoodle cookie. So she makes my sandwich and then asks if I want it warmed up. MINED BLOWN! I couldn't believe it they put it in what looks like a waffle maker but it fits the sandwich just right to heat the cookies and soften the ice cream. We passed on the toppings but these ice cream sandwiches were the best we have had. They sell the cookies and ice cream separately also if you would like. It was a wonderful treat, friendly staff. They even have a complimentary water cooler, which I needed after all that sugar yumminess. They even have a punch card to earn free items.",

It appears that one person works behind the counter in what can only be described as the most inefficient workflow possible.  The sad part about the super long wait is the fact that the excitement at the end makes it all worth it.  It has taken me about five minutes to write this review and I've inched up about three feet in line in this amount of time.  The review would be five stars if the wait wasn't so long.",

The BB was busy and eating the cookies is pretty messy so the place and tables get dirty quickly. Next time I would probably get better ice cream elsewhere with cookie toppings.",

It's pretty simple-If you like cookies, doughnuts, brownies, and ice cream there is nothing you won't like about this place. I got 2 funfetti cookies with cookie dough ice cream in the middle covered in fruity pebbles. The cookies were soft yet firm enough to hold the ice cream. You can also have your ice cream sandwich hot pressed to warm up the cookies. There's something here for everyone, you really can't do wrong if you like tasty, big, obnoxious ice cream sandwiches. I went on a weekday but I'm assuming they can get pretty busy on a Friday or Saturday night. Just like any restaurant in Scottsdale. Not a ton of seating inside either.",

I ordered the funfetti cookie with mint chocolate chip ice cream. So yummy! Hubby order the cookies & cream cookie with mint chocolate chip ice cream, my friend ordered the funfetti cookie with birthday cake ice cream and the kiddos shared the Baked Bear (cake batter) ice cream with the funfetti cookie! I had bites of all of them and they were all equally delicious! Love that they have such a big variety between cookies and ice cream. You can even get your ice cream sandwich rolled in M&M's, sprinkles, etc and you can even get whipped cream or hot fudge on top and better yet, have them hot pressed!! WHAT? I'm pretty certain there will be many visits in our future!",

    "text": "What can I say. I live in Glendale and a friend told me about this place so I drove out to visit. It's tucked away in a shopping center but it's so perfect I couldn't ask for more. First when you walk in you get hit with a wonderful smell of cookies and it's wonderful. Second the menus are very easy to follow. Starting with what kind of sandwich. I got the brownie sandwich, second you pick the ice cream and they have an amazing selection. Third the toppings ranging from cereal to sprinkles to hot fudge. And oh I almost forgot you can get it warmed up the cookies or brownies I must say I said no to it but changed my mind and glad I did. Finally I get to the end and was rung up and the price for it was great a big sandwich for a great price. Also they have a stamp card I think it's great I can go back again and get more stamps. But in all honesty what sent this place over the edge for me was the staff. Not only where they friendly but they had a great knowledge of what goes good for people to try. Second I met the owner tonight and I must say her personality was great to be around she was happy to be there and was a wonderful woman to talk to. I must say this place deserves more then a simple 5 stars they deserve 10 if not 100 stars.   Thank you guys for making my first time memorable. I will most definitely be back soon to have more.   P.S. They have indoor and outside seating this place it truly perfect.",

The ice cream tastes like mid-range stuff you can easily get at the grocery store.  The cookies and brownies taste like typical low end cookies you can get at a grocery store.  The hot caramel did not taste fresh made at all.  It tastes like the preserved stuff from the store.  The customer service is pretty good.  Everyone was super nice, friendly and helpful.  Unfortunately, the product itself leaves much to be desired.  Having trained under a pastry chef and making my own ice cream, brownies, pastries, hot caramel, and dessert bars, I have much higher standards.  This is fast food ice cream.",

I got the new Smore's ice cream which is delicious and then with a macadamia white chocolate cookie, which was also delicious. My review is more about the service setting. It's pretty expected that you're going to wait in a line at this place because it's still so popular especially around the time that we went which was perfect time for dessert, so you would think that as far as staff goes they would be prepared. The line this time around wasn't even long, but the wait was. We saw one girl by herself rushing around taking orders and then cashing people out. We wondered why there was only one person doing all of that especially with such a long line, and then saw another employee who was slowly wiping down tables and moving chairs when it was pretty damn clear that he needed to be helping the girl behind the counter. Finally about 15 minutes later he came to her aid and things started going much smoother. Maybe train the staff to be more aware if there's a line, there may be a need for more assistance behind the counter. If that was the case this time we probably wouldn't have seen about 5 to 6 people walk out because the wait was so long.",

    "text": "I remember when this place first opened the lines were so bad I didn't want to brave a visit. Well, I finally got around to it. And it was worth it!  The concept is cool: custom ice cream sandwiches. You can pick cookies, brownies, donut or a combo to be the top and bottom of your sandwich. Then pick an ice cream flavor and topping if desired.   Considering I always seem to be making a mess when I eat, no matter how hard I try, I decided the classic sandwich was a recipe for disaster. I opted for the much easier to eat brownie bowl, where you get a brownie and then add your ice cream and toppings on top. I got espresso ice cream and sprinkles. I believe you can also get a cookie bowl.   The scoop of ice cream was huge. For $6.50 it was a good size and I thought worth it. My partner got the same except with vanilla ice cream, and she really enjoyed the brownie.   The girl working was nice and offered us samples, although we didn't need any, and was available for any questions. The inside was clean and they have a water station. They also have punch cards - buy 9 get the 10th free. Not a bad deal.   I'd return to try some flavor combos and maybe some day I'll be brave enough to handle an actual sandwich.",

I have to say, I actually prefer the ice cream over the cookies.  Seriously try the toasted s'mores ice cream. It was so good. Real ribbons of marshmallow goodness and actual pieces of graham cracker. The snickerdoodle cookies seemed under done and too doughy. I can't say that all the cookies are like that. I tried some of my boyfriend's funfetti cookie and it seemed more done and tasted better. I will be back another night to try more flavors. Definitely a hot spot for dates/couples.",

I think I've said this in other reviews involving dessert type stuff, but I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to sweets. Also, I'm more of an ice cream & cookie person (opposed to cakes or pies) so The Baked Bear is right up my alley.   There's a good amount of cookies & ice creams to choose from (actually, I would say there's quite a bit of cookie options). They also do brownies & donuts (and you can combine if that tickles your fancy).  I wanted to guarantee I had a safe combo that went together so I went w/a salted caramel sugar cookie (which was the cookie of the month) & salted caramel ice cream. I had it warmed up. Surprisingly, the cookie warmed up perfectly & the ice cream only slightly softened and didn't melt. They cookies aren't huge, but decent enough size and I thought tasted really good (it's hard to say how fresh they were since they were warmed up). I also thought the ice cream was tasty and they use a good amount of it.   I thought the prices were good for what you got. I believe my sandwich was $4.95. The brownie & donut sandwiches are a little bit more. Everyone I was with liked what they had and the birthday girl got her treat for free :)",

One of my sisters gets salted caramel fudge (my mom got that today in a cup as well) in a snickerdoodle sandwich with caramel sauce on top. My other sister tried their Mexican Hot Chocolate cookie (it was their flavor of the month) with cookies and cream and finished it in like 2 minutes!   I sampled their blackberry crumble and liked it but stuck to rocky road which I got the first time around on top of their warm brownie bowl. It was a great serving size but this time I just did one scoop in a wafer cone.   I think it's great that they have a vegan option ice cream flavor. I also think it's nice that you can buy their cookies to go, we got a dozen for my niece's graduation tonight.   The only thing that I wish was different was that they had a sherbet flavor. The flavors they have are great but they are very heavy, then you add a cookie, brownie or donut (or 2!) and it's a very heavy dessert. Sherbet would be a good lighter option for people who maybe don't want such a heavy dessert.",

They had all the ice cream flavors available still and Bear Bowls. One of us wanted it hot pressed but they told us that they already turned their hot presses off for the night. The employees were joking and messing around, talking on the phone behind the counter, not at all interested in helping customers at all. Very rude. They already had put up the chairs on the table inside, so we were basically force to eat outside. Poor customer service and probably won't be going back.",

    "text": "The concept of selling ice cream sandwiched between two cookies isn't new to Phoenix. We've had a few local joints that have been offering up the cookie/ice cream combo for quite some years now. And while I can appreciate what they're doing here, my girlfriend and I just couldn't quite see what makes this place superior to its competitors.  The process is pretty straight-forward, laid out by the usual \"step-by-step\" menu found at all millennial chains these days. Choose your ice cream, pick your cookie flavors, and then decide whether or not you want the cookies heated or served cold. You can also add a topping if you wish.   I opted for the Bear Batter, which is cake batter flavored ice cream with chunks of chocolate. My girlfriend chose the Birthday Cake. We both decided on one chocolate chip cookie and one snickerdoodle. Based on most Yelp reviews, they recommend heating the cookies to soften them.  The ice cream is okay, but the cookies seemed too doughy. Keep in mind, the size of the \"sandwiches\" are astronomically large, meaning that a couple could easily split a single order and probably still be full. The amount of the ice cream they provide is generous, which can be both good and bad. Good, in the sense that you get a lot of it. Bad, in the sense that, it's virtually impossible to pick up and eat with your hands without mushing the ice cream to the point where it spills out and makes a big mess. Some people might like it, but we weren't impressed. In the end, we both ate maybe half of our sandwiches before tossing them.  I'm sure this place, which is an up-and-coming chain out of San Diego, will probably do just fine in the area. But unfortunately, there's a local place here in town that keeps things a bit more simple, smaller, cheaper, and dare I say, just better.  It was worth trying at least once, but I doubt we'll be back.",

    "text": "I agree, the hype isnt worth it either. So we went on a Sunday night, the lineup was huge but I was expecting that. I managed to keep my kids contained with eye-spy and people watching. B.B. offered misters and a big jug of cold water. There werent many cups left and the water was nearly empty. The outside tables were dirty. We finally snaked our way inside & got to see our ice cream & cookie choices. Hmmmm. :-/ i wasnt impressed. I would say there was about 5 staff working out front taking customers. See pics of the menu, maybe 5 or 6 different kinds of cookies and about 10 flavors of ice cream. Meh. I ordered single cones for my kids and a single (not sandwich) red velvet cookie with a scoop of rocky road ice cream. The cookie LOOKED tasty but had a weird after taste. The same with the ice cream. Maybe all the high quality non-gmo food I've been eating for past couple of months has destroyed me for cheap preservative laden ice cream/cookies but I couldnt finish my desert. It just didnt taste right to me. They were missing something in the mix? I just dont know. The restaurant was dirty, with spills and trash on the tables and floor, the trash cans were full and the water jug inside was almost empty too. Someone needs to be circling the restaurant to keep the place clean even when its busy. I would say this place would be a matter of personal taste for each yelper. The deserts look big and amazing but to me the combination of a dirty restaurant and mediocre food just wasnt worth the hype. Btw the bathrooms were predictably thrashed as well, but if they cant keep the restaurant clean then how could they keep the bathrooms clean? 'Nuf said.",

The sandwich itself can be comprised with a brownie, cookie, or donut. I choose two cookies. The cookies are your average cookie, nothing spectacular, but still tasty. It's hard to mess up a cookie. The seating inside is really tight especially if you have children. It the footprint of the store was bigger it would really make the family experience that much better. Overall a great place to get dessert if you are in the area.",

    "text": "This was a serious let down, and to be honest I probably docked it an extra star, because it just doesn't live up to the hype. The cashiers and servers were nice enough, but nothing special. The inside was clean, but again nothing really stood out. I approached it much like I would when ordering a pizza from a new pizza place, which is to order something basic and traditional like a pepperoni pizza. In my opinion a good restaurant should excel at the basic traditional things. In this case I ordered an ice cream cookie sandwich, vanilla ice cream, chocolate chip cookies, and sprinkles. They asked if I wanted it hot pressed, and I enthusiastically replied yes, hoping that this would address the problem many other reviewers noted with the cookie being to hard. It did not. Upon my first attempt at biting into the sandwich, a majority of the ice cream squeezed out in every direction except my mouth! I decided to try eating some of the excess squeezed out ice cream with a spoon first, and then attempt another bite. The second attempt did not go any better, and neither did the 3rd attempt! I ended up eating a majority of the ice cream with a spoon, which in my opinion is not very good tasting. I ended up with two messy cookies and a thin layer of ice cream in-between them. The cookie was not that amazing either. I feel like it was to thin, and to hard, especially for an ice cream sandwich of that magnitude! If you want a good ice cream sandwich try Trader Joes Sublime Ice Cream Sandwiches, or for a truly gourmet ice cream sandwich check out your local Fry's or Whole Foods for Coolhaus Ice Cream Sandwiches. If you want amazing ice cream desserts, stick with Sweet Republic!",

I feel like that much ice cream makes the cookies almost freeze a bit and thus are harder to bite into even though they're soft before there's ice cream on them. I feel like the ice cream at cold stone is richer or creamier or something but I have a feeling the ice cream can't be quite so creamy or it wouldn't stay on the cookies. Also, if you dream of picking up your sandwich and eating it with your hands, don't get hot fudge etc on it or your hands will be covered in the sauce!  Kudos to employee Joshua, my boyfriend and I had never been here before and he was enthusiastic and patient while we explored the different options. You can tell he really likes his job and isn't just your average bored ice cream store employee behind the counter.",

No customers were in there. I have heard about how crazy busy it can get, so I was worried there was going to be a line out the door. Lucky for us, that wasn't the case!   We were greeted when we walked in, and the staff was very patient with us. I told them I've never been here before and they informed me about what they offer. I wore my \"Friends\" shirt, (the tv show) and it was a nice conversation starter between the staff. The staff was very cool, laid back and friendly. Great team they have here.   I ordered the baked bear ice cream in a bowl with a brownies and whipped cream. My mom got a cookies and cream cone, my sister got a root beer float and my other sister had a birthday cake ice cream in a cup. Everything was AMAZING! They also have a water station!!! Such a necessity out here in Arizona!   I can't wait to come back to visit my family. I will definitely be coming back here. Great job you guys!",

It's a pretty standard order, but I'm of the mindset that if you can't do standard flavors correctly, then the rest of the operation isn't quite in line either.   Cookies are cookies and they're difficult to mess up. That said, I'd like to clarify that the sandwich was still good and I definitely ate it all, but I wished that the cookies were just a little bit more delectable, that the ice cream was a little bit more noticeable, and that it wasn't so dang difficult to eat. Maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe I should just try a brownie ice cream sandwich next time...",

So, there is a chance I got myself a little too excited about a place I knew next to nothing about... but, I was practically drooling on the uber right to this place and then sadly left a little underwhelmed.   Don't get me wrong, you walk out of there with your choice of cookies and ice cream, so I can't complain about that... I was mainly just unimpressed with their quality of cookie, and the freshness. It was definitely a yummy treat, but I left thinking that I could've made it at home and been just as satisfied.    To put this into further context, I want the record to show that I LOVE ice cream sandwiches... I sometimes contemplate (one day..) ditching a wedding cake and opting for ice cream sammies instead, so I do acknowledge I have high standards for this dessert in particular... but I still think it didn't live up to it's potential.",

Their cookies are delicious and I choose two different flavors. Then you get to choose your ice cream and toppings, if you want them.

    "text": "Very cute concept, a chain that started in California. This place must be mobbed in the summer but being December it was literally empty when we arrived and then a lot of people started coming in after us. It's certainly not inexpensive at six dollars for a cookie sandwich but you do get two freshly baked cookies and a fairly big scoop of ice cream in the middle.  My issue with ice cream sandwiches has always been that when you bite into them the filling goes flying out the opposite side because the cookie is more firm than the ice cream. Same thing happened here when they piled freshly scooped ice cream on the cookies and then warmed it. It's a total mess to eat, but delicious.  Our recommendation would be to use either the brownie as the base or the vanilla cookie if you are going to be choosing a highly flavored ice cream because a highly flavored cookie exterior clashes with the strong flavor of an ice cream like the salted caramel fudge ice cream and chocolate chip cookies that we chose. Together you could barely taste each one but separately they were both delicious, which led us to our conclusion that maybe this would be better with one of the two elements being more neutral in flavor. They have other interesting cookie options and even donuts as the top and bottom and you can even use different tops and bottoms so you could have a brownie top and a cookie bottom or a doughnut bottom and a brownie top etc. etc. They also serve scoops of ice cream either in cups or cones and sundaes as well. Oh and I forgot to mention that for $.75 you can get all sorts of different sticky gooey toppings for your ice cream sandwich - which at that point must be eaten with a fork and knife which they don't offer but they do have spoons! LOL Great place to blow your calorie bank or to bring kids of all ages - especially adults who are kids at heart and love ice cream.",

Didn't ask if we needed help or had any questions and the girl that served us was so standoffish and rude. She spoke maybe 5 words to me. I live in Peoria, came all the way out here for it and was disappointed. Most likely won't be back.",

She also took the napkin holders off the table. New people kept on coming in and they had no where to sit. I work in the food and beverage industry and if an employee of mine starting closing the FOH 20 minutes before close, with a whole line of people waiting to order food, I'd want to know.

First, you choose your type of cookie, then ice cream flavor, then toppings. Of course, because I have a huge sweet tooth, I asked them to double the amount of ice cream they put on the sandwich (6 scoops instead of three). I had chocolate chip cookies, cookie dough ice cream, and a ton of whipped cream. The guys working at the counter were very friendly, and I think a bit humored by the massive size of the sandwich. As far as taste, the cookies were soft and moist. The ice cream was excellent as well, loaded with tons of cookie dough. (NOTE: If you order abnormal sized ice cream sandwich, you can actually eat it like a sandwich. Mine was so huge I had to use a spoon.) They have a great patio as well.",

    "text": "Tried this place for the first time a week ago and we really enjoyed it. I'm not sure if I'm in the minority here, but the ice cream sandwiches are absolutely big enough to share. I got a combo with a brownie and cookie, and my husband got a traditional ice cream sandwich with two chocolate chip cookies. The cookies got super hard (because of the ice cream) which is to be expected.  I really liked the cake batter ice cream - way better than Cold Stone (and that's not a political statement, although it could be). One star knocked off because my husband's soy chocolate chip ice cream was not good. If The Baked Bear makes their ice cream in house - which is entirely probable - they should consider lactose-free milk... it makes for a much better product!",

But let me back up a minute. Their service was not very \"homey\" either. We went on a Friday night so it was pretty busy. Maybe the staff was tired or something because by the time we got to the counter they were not very friendly. We were greeted with a stark \"Do you know what you want?\" Not even a \"hi.\" We chose one with a peanut butter cookie, a M&M cookie and vanilla ice cream and one with chocolate chip cookies and vanilla ice cream.   We got both warmed up although it didn't seem to do anything - the cookies were cold and hard. I tried to use a spoon to get through the sandwich and it broke - that's how hard the cookie was! The ice cream was okay but the cookies were like grocery store quality cookies. They tasted plastic-y and mass-produced. Nothing about them seemed like a homemade cookie. Although I will say the peanut butter cookie was better than the M&M.   We were completely underwhelmed with this place and surprised that there was a line out the door. I guess people like mediocrity.",

They have numerous different ice cream flavors and numerous cookie flavors also, which was awesome but a little stress inducing to have so many choices!  On our visit, I ordered an ice cream sandwich with a donut on top, strawberry cheesecake ice cream in the middle, and a peanut butter cookie on the bottom- WITH SPRINKLES. It was deeeee-lish to say the least. My blood sugar probably sky-rocketed but who cares? Diabeetus here I come!  My brother and my niece ordered brownie ice cream sandwiches with cookies and cream ice cream in the middle and raved about them.   This place is the bees knees y'all!

I'm not sure how fresh the cookies were, but they were hard -- it was a little difficult to eat into the sandwich. We realized you can heat press the cookie, but that still didn't make any difference. The ice cream was ok too, not bad but nothing special about it either.

Imagine warm cookies and brownies coming hot out of the oven, with super friendly employees ready to pack your choice of ice cream and toppings between two of them.  Tip: you don't need to overdo it on toppings for an upcharge...the cookies add enough flavor. I had a chocolate chip cookie, mint chocolate chip ice cream, and a brownie on the bottom, all for about 6 bucks.  In Philly, we pay 8 bucks or more for something similar.

    "text": "What a disappointment! :( I've been dying to come to The Baked Bear since I found out they were coming to Scottsdale. Phoenix has some incredible locally-based ice cream shops, but I was so looking forward to an ice cream sandwich from here. (Le sigh.)  I'll start on the interior. Sorry, but there's no room in the vastly expanding food scene in the Valley for subpar build outs like at The Baked Bear. The lighting is terrible, the art on the wall is depressing and chintzy. There wasn't even a purse hook in the lady's room! The entire establishment just felt dirty and cheap. The LED \"Open\" light on the front door belongs on a 24 hour convenience store.   The ice cream was thin and cheap tasting. It simply can't compare to local scratch-made ice cream that you can find right down the street. The only slightly saving grace of my experience was the brownie bowl. During my visit I got a bear bowl with a brownie, cookies and cream ice cream, with hot fudge on top. While the ice cream was literally nothing I couldn't have gotten from a half gallon of Dollar Store brand cookies and cream, the brownie had good flavor. Was it heated up enough, as advertised? No. Was it all the way baked through? Not at all - in fact it was basically raw in the center. This works for me, but it should have been clearly described this way on their menu, if the shop was deliberately trying to serve undercooked baked goods to their customers. But, the taste was good. That's about it.  Note to consumers: read between the hype, and make a decision based on fact and quality as to weather a product is actually worth your purchase. A line out the door is not indicative of a bomb ice cream sandwich.",

Ice cream sandwiches using cookies, brownies and donuts is a newer thing out here and I was excited to try it. However, I do NOT think it is worth the hype. Baked Bear does have a very wide selection of cookies, ice creams and toppings. I went for Birthday Cake ice cream sandwiched between a red velvet and a s'mores cookie. I got it pressed because nothing beats a warm cookie with ice cream. The ice cream was DELISH. The cake flavor was not overwhelming and I love the sprinkles that were mixed in. The cookies however were pretty meh. The s'mores really tasted like an off chocolate chip cookie and the red velvet was pretty bland. Instead of being warm and gooey from the press, the cookies hardened which made the entire sandwich really difficult to eat. Additionally, my friend ordered two cookies and both came out fairly raw. Perhaps we got a bad batch of cookies, who knows.  If I was in the Scottsdale area, I would definitely come back and get some ice cream. However, I would not make the drive from the West Valley just to have this. Not worth the drive or the calories in my opinion to make that trip.",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  There are better ice cream sandwiches to be had out there.  Can't get on the 5-star bandwagon here because it just doesn't warrant it.  The Baked Bear ice cream sandwich is the equivalent of the overstuffed or Dagwood sandwich.  For $4 you get a very large scoop of ice cream between a couple cookies.  Or brownies, or a doughnut.  Let me compare this place to Ice Cream Sammies down in Chandler.  The cookie is pretty good, superior to Ice Cream Sammies.  It's one of those cookies with a little crunch on the outside and chewy on the inside.  It is often warm without having it warmed.  This alone helps this place out.  The ice cream here, though, is not good.  An average-flavor, too-soft mess that when sandwiched between two slightly warm cookies . . . I'll get to that.  I ordered vanilla between two chocolate chip cookies.  Again, no complaints about the texture of the cookies.  It was a little overly sweet - totally overpowered the vanilla ice cream.  Which was coming out all over the place.  This thing is a little unwieldy, more suited as a spoon affair than just your bare hands.  So again, the fallback comparison to Diddy Riese.  An always warm, well-balanced ice cream sandwich that at $2, is pretty perfect.  Even with ice cream that is not their own.  This is not that place.  All told, it is a pretty average ice cream sandwich where the cookie outshines the ice cream and where the finished product does not exceed the sum of the parts.",

Because of the news show, seems everyone else decided to come try them out because it was busy. Actually overtime I am near this location, there is always a lot of people there including those bringing large groups of kids which I can tell you is not fun because of the size of the shop.  Seating inside is likewise very limited so if you don't want to sit outside in the heat best to have one person in your group grab a table while you order.  The menu offers a decent selection of ice creams, unfortunately the flavors seem to be those that appeal primarily to kids and women who I am guessing are their main customer base.  Depending on what you order, the staff are pretty good at putting it together quickly unless you have to wait for a fresh batch of cookies.  Overall the ice cream was OK, not as good as Cold Stone and the portions could have been better for the price.  I will likely go back at some later time once the \"newness\" wears off .... which might be a while.  In the mean time, not worth spending 15 to 30 minutes waiting in long lines for.",

    "text": "This was a sweet treat! I would definitely recommend coming here. I've never seen a place like this before. I made an ice cream sandwich with funfetti cookies , cookies and cream ic and rainbow sprinkles on the outside. The girl working talked me into warming up the cookies. I was afraid it would melt my ice cream too much and make a mess. Which it did. Next time I'll definitely get my cookies warmed up but I will eat it in a bowl. The cookies were fresh and soft. It was absolutely delicious!! There is not a large selection of ic flavors but I think with the options of cookies and toppings that having a limited amount of ic flavors is probably a good idea. Lol. I loved this place!! I'll be going back and bringing people with me. MUST LOVE ice cream AND cookies:)",

They do everything right and they have it all, except buttercream icing! It's fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone craving a sweet fix! I know they originated in San Diego, CA, but I would vote to say they are contenders for the best cookies in Phoenix!",

I went with a group of 4 and all of our experiences were different. 2 of us had giant portions that we couldn't even finish and the other 2 were significantly smaller. We all had sandwiches so you'd assume they'd be similar in size? Some of the cookies and 1 brownie was so hard they weren't edible and some of the ice cream was freezer burned.  My funfetti cookie/vanilla ice cream combo was really good though!  Not sure if I'll be back since I've heard more and more negative things about this place.",

Ordered the funfetti sandwich with vanilla ice cream and sprinkles.  It was ok nothing amazing .  The Funfetti tastes like a sugar cookie and not funfetti to me (I'm a funfetti freak).  Once inside girls were sweet they even gave my bf a freebie card for next time since they ran out of brownie bowls.  Id go again..however I wouldn't wait in the line.",

I have been to the San Diego location and had a great experience, but my experience here was rather so so. The line wasn't terribly long, but it took almost half an hour to get to the front. After waiting so long It almost turned me off to the ice cream as it hindered the experience.",

I got something less...normal: Cookies and Cream and Strawberry Cheesecake cookies with coffee ice cream and fruity pebbles.  Weird? Yes.  Flavorful and yummy? YES! Cookies were perfectly baked and hot pressed.  And they're HUGE!  We wanted to finish each of ours but knew our bodies wouldn't handle that well.  The staff was friendly too.  I hope they open up in Chicago soon!",
