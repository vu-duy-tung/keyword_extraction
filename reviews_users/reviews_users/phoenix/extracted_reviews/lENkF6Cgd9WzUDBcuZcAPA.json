It's the closest it gets to a typical  \"around the corner\" taco place in any given Mexican town. Real ingredients. Our new favorite place. No more Cafe Rio, Chipotle or Costa Vida. Why go to the imitators when you can go to the real thing? And the staff was very friendly. 100% positive experience :)",

The service was not friendly I speak English and Spanish but they seemed like I was bothering them and they pretended like they understood my English but then seemed confused about my order, and when I tried to clarify the order I seemed to be bothering them again. No one seemed happy to be working here. I'll raise my review once I try it again if they are friendlier or if one of the other dishes is good.",

At first it seems to be traditional Mexican food that takes you back home, and the staff is very friendly/attentive to your order. It may have been a bad day for them but the food I ordered was not that great. It seems to be more of an Americanized Mexican cuisine, and in my opinion didn't have that traditional Mexican spark. I ordered a Carne Asada burrito with beans, rice and a few of the fixings yet wasn't amazed as the flavors were very bland. My friend however ordered a Fajita Mix plate which was more appealing to my taste. I may eventually return to give it a second chance and try something different.",

The taco shells were pre-made stale and gross. Like they bought them at Taco Bell and reused them. Zero manners or customer service skills. Will not go back and would not recommend.

The scoops of rice and meat and soooooo small for such a big tortilla. I saw the worker scoop such a small portion of chicken on my tortilla and I asked for a little more and he said it would be extra. I'm all in for paying extra for double meat, but he barley put any on in the first place! I just wish they didn't have such strict portion controls on their scoops of rice, beans and meat. They also ran out of guacamole when I went the other day :(.",

Recently they have started to charge for items that you would normally get for free at other restaurants. We normally get the burritos and it is an extra $1.25 for jalapeno cream cheese. Since the burritos are served with chips we get a side of salsa with it, they now charge $1.00 for a 1oz portion of salsa. So now the cost of the burrito is $2.25 over what they have listed.  $1.00 for 1oz is just crazy!",

The perfect mix of chipotle and one of those quick Mexican joints that always goes by a different name, betos/rancheritos/Alberto's/Floribertos/etc.  I was absolutely blown away by the quality of food, the serving sizes, and the prices. I went with the el jefe and boy oh boy I was not disappointed. This burrito was absolutely stacked, and it is all so fresh and warm. If my memory serves me right (it's been 2 weeks) I got to choose rice and type of beans, it had chorizo, carne asada, cheese, some avocado and sour cream and the best spread of hot sauces you can imagine.  I really suggest you order the hot sauces on the side because you can burn your face off if you aren't careful. I ordered a couple of mild sauces and I was losing my head, and I can handle a fair amount of heat. The plate also comes out with chips so that was awesome.  My wife snagged a plate of random hard shell tacos and I was so surprised to see the cook drop fresh shells into the fryer when she ordered! They are always fresh and hot - never stale!!! That's incredible!  The other couple we went with had this random thought to snag a couple of churros and... frankly my life will never be the same. They come out with a little cup of caramel sauce, and it is the perfect amount of crispy and soft in the center. No words are even in the English dictionary that describe how good these were. My mind is still blown.  I would make this a habit of twice a week if I lived near by, and no food right now is a twice a week habit for me. Do yourself a favor and go here.",

Start with an order of 5 street tacos and mix 'em up to get a great sampling of the offerings.  My personal favorite is the carne asada but close seconds are the chicken and barbacoa.  Try them with the chipotle mayo in place of sour cream.  On your second visit, come for the breakfast burritos.  The El Jeffe is phenomenal with egg, chorizo, smiley bacon, carne asada and eggs.  I got mine as a chimichanga (fried burrito) smothered in green sauce.  This could be a world beater if they fried the burrito harder.  Ask for it crispy if that is what you want.  If this restaurant was near D.C. Ranch, there would be lines out the door every day for lunch and reviews monthly in Phoenix magazine comparing others to this new standard for flavors.",

Full of flavor and spice.  However, what made this place ridiculously good was their attention to both fresh and authentic flavors.  My hard shell tacos?  Yeah, they fried them to order.  When I ordered the tacos they threw three fresh tortillas on the grill, then placed them in a fryer, then stuffed them with my meats and toppings.  Mouth-watering good.  The husband got the el-jefe burrito and was in love with it.  My recommendation though is to go with something where you can try a handful of their meats since they are so amazing!  If I lived nearby, this place would be a weekly stop for me.  I'll dream of you Mucha Lucha... until next time...",

The verde salsa is pretty darn spicy - in the group we went with, I was the only one who didn't think it was too spicy. We got a verde carnitas wet burrito, verde wet burrito el pastor, verde fajita mix wet burrito, carne asada breakfast burrito (the only one we got that wasn't wet), and another wet burrito, rojo (I can't remember the meats!). Everyone was really happy with their meals, and two of us couldn't finish. I had half a burrito left for my next meal! Everything was delicious, and we'll be going back for sure.  Service: Very friendly. We weren't the only people in there, but all of the staff were very kind to us and took the time to get our orders right. They seemed happy to see us, and we felt welcomed.  Worthy of note: You can't see anything in the bathroom - there's one blacklight bulb in there, but be prepared with your phone light or something. It's fun and trippy, but also a little frustrating.",

Up next will be the surf and turf burrito or the shrimp tacos which I saw in real life and instantly wish I would have got. Good job Mucha Lucha!",

Had the 5 street tacos all w different meats, ended up going back for more to take home. Great place!

The meat is well trimmed and always has just enough flavor to be extremely tasteful yet not overpowering.  Ingredients are always fresh and shows in the taste of salsa.

    "text": "I'll start with the positives (I did give it 3/5 stars, which technically is a passing grade):  The place is clean.  The people seem like hard-working, honest folks, the kind you wish success to.  And the tortillas (used in the street tacos) are very good, possibly even made there.  As for the detriments, basically the food is not all that good.  The chicken chipotle, for example had a very odd taste (and even smell).  It was also dry.  I'm glad I only ordered one of those, I don't think I could've eaten a 2nd one.  The barbacoa simply didn't taste good, and the adobada was so-so.  The green chili tacos were the best ones of the bunch.  I admit that these main reasons are somewhat subjective.  But additionally, while I said the place is clean and the people hard-working, they are also disorganized.  It took an unusually long time for someone to get to the counter after I had gotten my food so that I could pay for it.  They had also \"ran out\" of aguas frescas, which was very disappointing.  This was at 12:30pm.  And the usual containers for them weren't even out in sight, which leads me to believe, based on the fact that they were running around the whole time, that they simply didn't get to make the aguas that day.  For a while they were also out of napkins.  Napkins!  And when I bought a glass-bottled soda, nobody could find the opener, so one of the guys grabbed his Rambo mini-knife and used it as a lever to open the bottle.  These are the kinds of things I mean by disorganized.  One FYI that has nothing to do with my grade:  if you are used to or looking for Northern Mexico style food, this is not your place.  None of the staples like asada, pastor, cabeza, etc.  And the meats like barbacoa and adobada are completely different than what you may be used to.  If you're very familiar with Mexican cuisine across the board, then you already know about these differences.  But otherwise, FYI.",

The place is efficiently run and contains all of the standards you'd expect.  Highlights include their taco Tuesday special and the surf -n- turf burrito.

Five tacos for a little over $8 is reasonably priced, but they skimped on the meat portions compared to many other restaurants that serve street tacos.   Also, on the meat and salsa there is quite a bit of a learning curve for first time guests. Sampling really caused a delay for those waiting in line. And the owners have a tendency to add an extra charge for everything (ex. one extra small cup of salsa, a plate of 10 tortilla chips, etc). Still seems like they have a few things to figure out on the customer service side, but the food here is excellent!",

At least 6 different meat choices and a really expansive menu including a small breakfast section all make for a great food experience. The atmosphere is very fun and very authentic you truly feel like you're in a Mexican taco shop, not some westernized version. I got the potato chorizo and egg breakfast burrito and let me tell you it was delicious. Chorizo is extremely underrated and adds so much flavor to anything breakfast related that it is in. My amigo got a barbacoa burrito and practically inhaled the thing. I thought I was gonna have to get the paramedics sitting behind us to resuscitate him right there at the table. The chips were also incredible. It might seem simple but a good chip can really complement a Mexican meal and Maskadores' do not disappoint in the slightest. Not to mention extremely friendly and fast service which all helped contribute to a positive taco/burrito experience. And it helps that it's right across the street from the Scottsdale police station!",

But Mucha Lucha Taco Shop is so much more than that! They redesigned the interior, It's bright pink, makes you want to stay for a bit. Ordering is easy its if you were at chipotle, but you don't get the robot workers asking about tortillas and what kind of plate you want your burrito in. It's 3 workers I think one of them is the owner and maybe 2 other relatives. But other than that they really got it together inside and outside. Now let's talk about the menu, it's pretty simple to the point from tacos to burritos and they also ask you what you want inside your taco or burrito etc. I've been here a couple of times and I'm never disappointed! Hands down best food quality and service for a small local shop! Love it! Hope you guys enjoy!",

Both delicious! However, I think my first order is still my favorite- I ordered a few different tacos including their shrimp and fish. Amazing!",

The prices are also misleading - I ordered a wet burrito, which was 8.49 on the board, but was charged over $12.

When I go to pay I'm charged +$3 for the portion she took off and put back on.. it was nothing.. I love the food and I've come here enough times to know what to expect when I order but I'm done coming here when there's so many other great options closeby.

We were some of the last patrons in that evening and we accidentally stayed a little past their closing time (ten mins). The staff was very kind and did not make a big stink of closing. They quietly locked the door and kindly let us out once we finished. The four of us were so engrossed in our food that we didn't notice the time. YUMMY food, great portions for the price.

That's the first impression when you walk in along with the paintings of the Mexican wrestlers.  The menu is simple like chipotle but similar ingredients as the normal fast food burrito places  All of that goes away when you try the food. I had the surf and turf burrito with pico and spicy guacamole. This burrito had huge shrimp and carne asada meat.  The cook/owner allows you to customize your burrito with various ingredients and also asks you how you want them cooked.   The 5 stars was easy for me and I plan on going back tomorrow.",

    "text": "I debate on 3 or 4 stars. It's Chipotle/Subway style ordering. They have a chalkboard style menu of what type of food you can order (5 street tacos, 3 flour tacos soft, crispy tacos, burrito, etc) but don't specify the meat types so everyone was asking. They heat the tortillas up on the flat top to get the the browning on them which is delicious. It slows down the ordering process though and the line got pretty long.   Not really understanding the process, if you order flour tacos they ask if you want rice and beans. They mean on your taco, not on the side. Then they ask meat, there are 5-6 different ones to choose from. My husband and I liked the chipotle chicken the best. The carne asada seemed popular as well. It's hard to tell which meat is what because it's sitting in the sauce. When they take the meat a lot of the sauces get transferred which is good, but it makes the tacos SUPER soggy. I ordered the street tacos, they double the corn tortilla, heated it to make it more sturdy and the tortilla was still soggy and breaking. My 5 street taco plate just became a a meat, tortilla, soupy mess. If I ordered again, I'd do the chipotle chicken (less saucy) with 1 flour, 1 corn and 1 crispy.   The salsas are excellent. They don't explain them but ask hot, medium or mild. Hot is very hot, if you like heat I highly recommend it. If you order medium they ask if you want red or green.   I think we will try this place again. I probably won't do the street tacos again, it was good for a first visit because you get to try most of the meats and the tacos are small (5 is the right amount).   Overall, everyone in there seemed to be regulars and know what they liked. My husband and I were definitely newbies compared to everyone else! It's all made there, everyone was friendly and working very hard.",

    "text": "Came here to try this place out with a friend. Decent but reasonable distance to drive.  Small parking lot outside. Came around 2pm on Saturday. Was not busy. No waiting.  Inside is very simple. Ordering station is like Chiptole. You can see what you can get and they will add it into your order. Menu is pretty simple, but you have no idea the type of meat that they have unless you ask.   Food: I got the Meat burrito this time.  For the meat, I got the green chile pork roast. As this was too have some spice to it *not that spicy after tasting it).  The green chile pork does have good flavor and the meat is very moist and breaks downs easily when you bite into it. Pretty good.  They will heat up a big tortilla before letting you make your burrito I got pretty much everything on display, Including the Jalapeno cream cheese, but that cost around $1.48 extra, little bit expensive just for that. However, it did make the burrito taste different and it was good.  Guac sauce is also extra around that same price, but I did not get that.   I got 3 of their sauce in the burrito, which tasted good to me when it's mixed and you bite into the burrito.   Price: I think the burrito costed around $8.50 + tax, my total was around $9.60 or something because of additional charge of cream cheese.   Would recommend trying this place. They do have seafood taco and street tacos style. Will need to come back and try them as well.",

The chicken is so juicy and naturally sweet. The beef with green chili is also tasty.  The best part is the Churro! We got 3 to go and they also gave us the dipping sauce for the churro.

It's set up like a Subway or Chipotle, where you order what you want and they make it for you with the ingrediants you choose. Since it was still early, I got the carne asada breakfast burrito which included egg, beans, cheese, and whatever other fillings and sauces you wanted. it was pretty big and was served wrapped in foil with a handful of chips. I also got a Mexican Coca-Cola. A very filling, delicious breakfast for under $10. I almost didn't finish it!

Ok amount of meat but my girlfriend got tons more on her street tacos. Then when I selected my other ingredients the lady who was serving me just threw ingredients down on the plate impatiently. I asked for salsa, and she filled up two 2oz containers, but one she filled up only half way. Well guess what... each salsa container costs $.75.  Charging for salsa and not even filling the whole container up... not cool.  So we get to the register and she keeps hitting me charge after extra charge without explanation and I keep having to ask what \"open food\" charge is...  the experience was horrible.

Their music is a little loud, but creates a fun atmosphere.

I found out I have a gluten allergy about 6 months ago and was pleased to find out that Mucha is gluten-free friendly. If you are very sensitive I would not recommend. However, I am not and I have never gotten sick after eating here. The carne asada is gluten free so I get a carne asada burrito bowl with rice, beans, toppings and some warmed up corn tortillas on the side. It was THE BEST. The owners and workers are always so nice and accommodating. Definitely has a family run vibe. My favorite take-away spot in the south scottsdale area by far.",

If you haven't been here yet it's like chipotle for those who like real Mexican food not the gringo stuff. Everything was fresh, the servers were polite, the restaurant was clean, and we couldn't have left happier or fuller. I would most definitely suggest this to all my yelp friends and all of my real life friends too. Do yourself a favor and crush a burrito from here, I'm sure it's enough food for all day too because I don't think they know what a small serving size is here. We will be returning when we are in the area for sure. Also a small tip for those who like it extra hot, their habanero salsa has plenty of kick and it's not over bearing, step up to the plate because it's awesome.",
