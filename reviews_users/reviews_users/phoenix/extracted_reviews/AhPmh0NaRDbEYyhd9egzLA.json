There taco Tuesdays and happy hours are awesome as well!   Worth giving it a try!",

They gave my girlfriend a plate a vegetable slop and told us the rice was no longer vegan.  They really tried to make it right, and I commend them for doing that...but ultimately this place is a terrible mess and definitely not worth checking out with all the delicious choices in town.

It was a Saturday and I got semi rockstar parking and they werent needing to do valet since its not peak season(according to one of the hosts). As you walk in you wil see the U-shaped bar with plenty of seats and then tables both indoors and on a decent sized patio. We were a group of ten and Austin was our main server. He was always paying attention as each person showed up and made sure no ones drink glasses were empty. Same with checking on orders making sure it came out and the way you wanted. We had a veggie burrito that was supposed to be no mushrooms he realized kitchen didnt do it right. Got a replacement on the fly boxed up the old one and even took it off the bill!.   A handful of people had the corn to start I just my serrano margarita which I would get again and again and again. Some reason last night I mixed it up and switched to beer once I got my tacos. The whole table loved the carne asada whether it was in a taco or burrito. I was expecting flavor from the adobada and the braised beef. Ive had other tacos there that I liked more but carne asada everytime for sure. Since I've had the ceviche before Il comment on that. It was good size nice flavor great mix no one else at the table seemed real excited about having it so I didnt order it last night but I'll get it again.   Good prices Great service (split checks for ten people never fun) nice clean fun vibe.",

It is super hipster and I think that Joyride has made the hipster trend the priority of this place and not the food.  When we walked in there was no hostess, and we had to flag a waitress down just to get our seat. It  took them forever to take our order and the waitress was extremely unprofessional. She tried to memorize our order but could not, and we ended up having to repeat it several times. The food took so long to come out and it was cold by the time it came out. I had a baja, a chicken, and carne asada taco. Filibertos is better than these tacos.  And they were $2 each, but there are much better street tacos running up to $1.89 all around! The 11 cents were a steep price to pay for bad service and bad food. Also, in the middle of our meal we requested limes (Yes, the tacos do not come with them), and it took them a god ten minutes to bring them out. To be fair, I did not expect them to remember to bring them to us.  The food here is garbage, as is the service, the restaurant is severely understaffed, and while the restaurant is cute, the music was playing so loudly I could not physically hold a conversation with a friend. I cannot think of a single reason to come back here. Honestly speaking, taco bell has better tacos than Joyride. It's clearly catering to hipsters that care more about the aesthetic of the food than the flavor.",

The flavor was unfortunately a bit bland. I was expecting more spice due to the fact that there was a fire emoji next to this item on the menu. I also wasn't a huge fan of the chips. I typically like thin crispy chips but I was more concerned about my unimpressive taco. My sister got the shrimp taco and said it was great! So if you like shrimp, I'd go for the shrimp!!!!",

You have to pay for chips and salsa after the first basket which is kind of annoying. The margarita was pretty good too.

Near the end it did get rather busy so I suggest the earlier the better. Our waitress was great! Very nice and informative, even convinced us to try to margaritas! I got the coconut margaritas and my other coworker got a prickly pear. Mine was nice and smooth great taste! The prickly pear was a bit too sweet for my liking but still really good. We both agreed that they were not strong at all. We usually feel a bit fuzzy after one Margarita and these didn't do that to us. Still really good though.  Food came out rather fast. Again this might be because we got there pretty early before the rush. Everything looked great. I got 3 of their street tacos. One standard, one Carne Asada, and one pork. They all had amazing taste to them. Can't really decided which one I liked more. The waitress did forgot my salsa but it wasn't a big deal because honestly, the tacos didn't need it at all.  The ambiance is nice and casual. I would love to see this place at night. Has to be so pretty! It is a bit more on the trendier hipster side of things but it fits well all together. Will definitely consider coming back again. Maybe next time at night! Oh and postinos is right next door! Score!",

Both times I have been here I rode my bike, they have ample bike parking and a big patio.  The bar is gorgeous with the stained glass vases and the concept of the restaurant is very laid back and open. I have a feeling I will be spending a lot of time here when I can pull myself away from the Windsor.   I also love that they honor the Upward tradition of $5 till $5 on pitchers and wine.   The tacos are street style and with so many street style tacos shop these days it is hard to find something phenomenal on the menu. That being said though everything I tried was very good. The carne, the nachos and the salsa will all keep me coming back for more.   I'd love to see them do brunch!",

Soooo we got too full to order anything else. We'll have to come back for the tacos because I'm confident they'll be as delicious as the nachos were! Both dishes were flavorful, the meat was tender & not chewy, And the portions were huge - enough to share for 4 people. The cheese didn't get dry, the creme wasn't too runny, it was simply tasty! We also had the almond horchata w/rum in it. DEE-LISH-OUS lol",

My pineapple juice was great! Just the right amount of sweetness!   Chips and salsa were okay. It needed more spice and flavor. The salsa tasted sweet to me.   My carne asada quesadilla was BOMB! Probably the best food item I ordered.   I got my meal about 35 minutes later. The waitress took forever with everything and I didn't like the tacos. The meat had a teriyaki flavor to them topped with some more sweet salsa. I disliked them very much. The rice was better than the tacos, but still tasted off.   The decoration was nice. The atmosphere was clean. The best way I could describe this place was \"Mexican food with a hippie twist.\" If that's what they were going for, they nailed it. This place would not be my first choice or on my list to go to again.",

We sat for over 10 minutes with no drinks, chips and salsa came quickly though.  We waited so long, so we ordered our food with our drinks. Our food came out before we even got the drinks we ordered.  We couldn't leave fast enough. So unimpressed with this downtown central Phoenix eatery.",

I had a lukewarm experience with Joyride.  We went with a large group of friends. Started out with cocktails and chips and salsa. I had an aqua fresca with gin. It was good but light on the gin. Salsa was boring.  We then ordered our food and another round of drinks. I ordered the veggie burrito and a beer. My husband ordered tacos with a side of beans. My veggie burrito was just okay. It wasn't bad but I have had much tastier. I was excited about the \"white magic\" sauce that came in it but it seemed non-existent. I doused a lot of hot sauce on my burrito. My husband liked his tacos a lot. We both thought the beans were very bland. My beer? Well, it took 40 minutes to come out.   I have a hard time with the value at Joyride. Mexican food should not be this expensive... if it is then it should be very special. I wasn't feeling it. I love the atmosphere, servers were nice. They comped the beer they almost forgot. I am willing to give Joyride another try.",

I was not disappointed the tacos were great!, fresh ingredients, very well seasoned and marinated meats.   I really like that they put their own twist on each taco and add the right toppings, seasonings, to make it that much better. When you don't even need to add the hot sauce you know is good stuff!

Maybe, but as I refine my yelping, I've become more selective on doling them out, which is not fair because earlier in my yelp experience I gave them out like a drunk sailor on shore leave.  So factor that in.   I will say we had an awesome experience at Joyride and I will go back.  The service was excellent from the front desk on.  A sweet hostess, super cool waitress and a gentleman who I believe was the manager all attended to our group with the type of genuine sweetness I find lacking in most of these concept driven Hipster employed venues.  This paved the way for an excellent night as it put us in the mood to enjoy the food and atmosphere.    We loved the space, and really loved the music which made it hard not to tap toes too (and with speakers in restroom's we joked that we might have had an after party dance club in there).   The food was serviceable, braised tacos were out favorite and nothing was bad per se, but really it was the overall experience we enjoyed and the food hit the spot.    My only negative was that I rarely eat sweets, so we got churro's and i'm spoiled being from LA where I can get them so soft and fluffy and flaky and delicious, these seemed like carboard by contrast.",

    "text": "Unable to wait for \"Taco Tuesday\", we headed down to Joyride Taco House on Central Avenue on Monday afternoon around, coincidentally, Happy Hour and discovered what promises to be a fantastic new addition to our rotation of favorite spots. It was the first visit for any of us, though we'd driven past on numerous occasions.  We were greeted warmly immediately on entering and led to a table. There is a nice patio area outside, complete with gas fireplace, which I'm sure is where you'll want to be during the more pleasant months here in Phoenix.  Hannah was our server and she was just great. Fun, prompt and just friendly.  Chips and salsa were quick to follow.   For drinks T's mom and I chose the Blood Orange margarita, while T had the Cucumber-Serrano margarita. Loved the Blood Orange. While I thought the cucumber-serrano was good, it just wasn't to my taste.  For our meal we each chose a small variety of the street tacos. I had one each of the carne asida, standard and pork adobada, all of which I thoroughly enjoyed. Still wanting a bit more, I finally tried the Crispy Fish taco which was also a winner. Everyone came away just really pleased with their selections.   Joyride has a nice, open feel to it while at the same time providing seating that still feels intimate. While we didn't visit the bar area in the center of the space it looks to be a great spot  to spend time. The decor is pleasing to the eye and really well balanced as far as the selection of tones of the furnishings. Maybe strange to note, but it does make an impression.   So, overall I really like Joyride and definitely be returning. No question. Recommended!",

My son devoured his kids' quesadilla and enjoyed getting a fake tattoo. I had a brisket burrito bowl and while I could have used a little more meat, it was absolutely tasty. My wife had three tacos and, while I usually think chicken tacos are usually boring, both types packed in flavor.  The salsa was flavorful and added a nice kick of heat at the end. The only issue I had were that the tortillas, taco shells, and chips were a bit bland (thus, I was glad I ordered the burrito in a bowl). I'd also skip out on the fish taco - a little overcooked and you can get better and cheaper ones from other places. But these are very small critiques as the meals overall were uniformly delicious.   Tuesday seems like a great day to come - $2/taco and happy hour drink prices. They also have a curated mescal list, which I definitely want to try. I'll be returning for sure.",

    "text": "I go to this place for the Taco Tuesday/Happy hour deals and the proximity to my house, but it's really quite overpriced if you don't go during those times (2-6 weekdays, 2-close on Tuesdays). For Taco Tuesday, however, you get $2 tacos and $5 margs though will wait on a table and fight for a parking spot in the lot behind or adjacent parking lot during peak hours. My favorite is the Blood Orange Margarita, but was recently recommended the Pineapple Mojito which was sweet and tart and lovely. Tacos are okay: stay away from the carnitas (nothing impressive), the crispy fish and the standard are better though lack punchy flavor.  I wouldn't trek across town for this place but if you're in the area and haven't tried it yet, I would check it out for happy hour drinks if nothing else.",

    "text": "Food: food was great! Great variety. Vegetarian burrito is so unique and delicious. They toast up one of the sides of the burrito so it gives it a contrasting texture to the softer veggie filling. The tomatio salsa on the side they provide is a must try. It really compliments the flavors of the various veggies in the burrito.  The taco platter is not disappointing. The different meats all have different flavors: carnitas, carne asada and spicy chicken. It also comes with cabbage, avo, rice and beans. The taco tortillas have a stone toasted aroma.  Def recommend the platter if you are indecisive about what taco to chose.   Environment: the decor is so nice, modern with splashes of bright colors. Theme kind of in the 70s. Unique!   Parking: self, plenty.   Service: our main server seemed a little pushy when we were ordering, asked twice if we were done. When we were mid meal and enjoying our company, she interrupted and asked if we were ready for the check and if we wanted boxes. It made us very uncomfortable. We were at late dinner at 9pm, the place was not packed and they don't close till 11 so we were confused to as why she was so pushy.   Overall: the food was great! I really enjoyed it. Service was really off and odd. It prevented a full 5. I may come back but on a slow time with weird service I can't imagine what prime time or what taco Tuesday is like.",

I also have came on the weekends or when it wasn't happy hour, but honestly for the quality of drinks and food I'm getting it's still a great deal! I've sat at the bar multiple times (which seems to be a tad quicker more or less) and dined in the regular seating when I'm with a larger group. Never a long wait and the staff is so attentive. I've brought just about all my friends here and they've always loved it. Can never get enough chips & salsa, delicious margaritas (I always order the original Joyride one), and they are SO good with alternating orders to diet needs like vegan, etc. Amazing!

I eventually got my taco (or three) and the best Brussels sprouts I've ever had in my life. The new waitress, who eventually showed up to take care of us, just wasn't the same. I guess, sometimes you do have to settle for second best or risk ending up alone and taco-less.",

Parking is a little tricky at times but I think Upward Projects has done a great job adding more parking for all their restaurants at this intersection. Sometimes the wait can be a bit long but they have seating outside and they will grab your drink order and bring you chips and salsa while you wait. The service has always been friendly and super accommodating even though you may not have an individual server.   We ordered veggie tacos on this visit which were solidly delicious. Being a vegetarian I appreciate the servers warning that the black beans were not vegetarian. I also ordered a margarita (can't remember which one right now) but it was very good. In the past I've had their agua frescas, loved those too.   I like the decor and layout of this place. It's a solid restaurant and one I would recommend.",

    "text": "Ok I had to come back and post something. I mean I had too!  We went back to Joyride after so many pleads from my husband. I gave in after two years! This time things went a little bit super different!   First of all we picked the best day to go nice and rainy today we walked in and are seated by a nice gentleman. He asks if we'd rather have a seat by the window so we could enjoy the beautiful weather. Yes!!!! We picked our table since it wasn't as busy as last time. No wait! Nice and quiet! This time I was able to enjoy it a bit more since we didn't take our kids and it was calm.  Server took order for our drinks and chicken nachos. I ordered a prickly pear margarita. So good!   Another gentleman came to ask if our order had been taken and he was happy to know staff was on top of it!   Nachos came and we couldn't resist. They were so good! I really liked that the chips for the nachos were thicker than the one used for the chips and salsa. Means they won't get soggy in between conversations! Loved the chunks of avocado and the flavor on the chicken was so good!   I HAD to try some tacos. So after dominating the nachos with my husband we ordered four tacos; he ordered one carne asada, one braised beef and I got one Baja fish, one chicken tinga. (So a bit different from last time we visited Joyride)   I didn't taste my husbands because I am not feeling red meat so I am glad I had the option for chicken and fish! I did add a bit of salt because I always add salt to everything but both tacos were very good!   I really enjoyed going back it might've been a mixture of no kids, not busy, and alcohol!  Whatever it was Joyride has redeemed itself! Although they offered to pay from my last review and it's been two years. I wouldn't want to change the outcome. If you enjoy it you should definitely pay for something that's worth it!   I'd recommend for you to go on a less busy time and to make it a date night instead!",

Our waitress, I didn't get her name but she has the same hair style as Garth Algar on Wayne's World (Dana Carvey character) was nice enough for most of our stay but kinda whimsical. Anyway, we wanted to pay the bill but I felt like the waitress was trying to pawn us off on the next waitress/waiter , she said her shift was ending. I told her we want to pay now so we can go too. The waitress took my card, came back, and said it was declined. I told her without a doubt their system was down she said , \" this isn't happening with my other customers and they would've told me the system was down\" I said, \" I'm going to give you another card to prove my point\" she ran the next card and it declined. At this point I said, \" you need to get your manager. The waitress came back and said, \" they just told me there's something wrong with the system\" by then it was too late to apologize as she could've handled  the situation a little differently also, we had an audience at this point, I felt bad for the people sitting next to us because instead enjoying their dinner, they're listening to this rude  waitress insist that my cards are declining. This place literally and figuratively left a bad taste in my mouth. I'd rather go down the street a few miles and eat at Commodore Guadalajara's",

    "text": "I'm well aware this place is popular and probably doesn't need a review.  That said, I finally got a chance to stop in while visiting family (my last visit was so busy that I ended up across the street at The Windsor -- which I also enjoyed) because apparently my cousin has lived down the street for like 15 years.  I've just never been to his house before.  Anyway, long story short, food and margaritas were pretty good, atmosphere was fun, and I imagine if I lived in Phoenix, I'd spend many an evening here.  What I really wanted to showcase though was the customer service.  I was just a lone person eating at the bar at late lunchtime during the week, and they were still fairly crowded.  I was mildly annoyed at the time my entree took, but also happily busy on my phone to pass the time while enjoying a margarita, and their chips and salsa kept me from grumbling.  Turns out, they were more irritated than me, and apologized profusely for taking so long and ended up taking care of part of the bill.    On top of that, at the beginning, I'd gotten an iced tea, because well, it's what you do with Mexican food when you grew up in AZ, and then switched to margaritas.  They offered early on to give me another iced tea to go when I left, which I took them up on.  Unfortunately, two margaritas later and halfway to my car across the street... realized I'd never waited for the tea to come back after paying my bill (this time my bad).  I ran back in, and the hostess was already  just outside the door with iced tea in hand.  So yeah, the food and booze options and what looks like a fun place got me in, as well as a rec. from a friend who loves him some Taco Tuesday, but the service will get me back anytime.",

Then someone brought some chips and placed them on the bar that was full of crumbs that I had to asked to be cleaned.  Finally, another bartender came over to take our order grudgingly.  After a while they asked if we were hungry.  Not what would you like to have.    After that I wanted another drink and was ignored.

    "text": "Joyride taco house was really good. I thought because it was like an upscale taco shop that the tacos were not going to be good but I was mistaken. I had the crispy fish, carnitas and carne asada tacos and they were reeeeaaally good for an upscale restaurant,  they had a lot of meat so with just 3 tacos and the side rice I was full. I went there to celebrate my wife's birthday and we were able to reserve the cocktail lounge outside. It was amazing and comfy. I think we were there for around e hours and the waiter kept bringing us refills on our drinks and salsa. I definitely recommend Joyride...",

    "text": "Joyride is our go-to Mexican restaurant. It's fun, fairly inexpensive, has delicious food and most importantly, they are really great with food allergies (from our experiences). I've visited many times before, but realized I never left a review, so here we are.  First off, they serve free corn chips and salsa at all tables, which are gluten-free (YES!). They also don't fry their chips or tortillas in peanut oil (another YES!!). Surprisingly, a lottttt of restaurants int he area use peanut oil in their fryers, which is a big no-no for those with peanut allergies.  Secondly, their drink menu is so great! They have happy hour menu most days of the week, and on Tuesdays, from 2pm to close, they have $2 tacos and $5 margaritas! Highly recommend.  Third, they can virtually adapt most recipes on the menu to your food restrictions, allergies or intolerance's, which is amazing for those avoiding gluten, dairy or eggs. I got a burrito in a bowl, without the tortilla, and without cheese, and it was so delicious (as always!). Their tacos are incredible, and their apps are delicious as well.  Fourthly, I want to give a shout-out to our amazing server, Tory, who took care of us this evening. He was so incredibly patient and knowledgeable about the menu, and took extra precautions to make sure we could eat with a food reaction. THANKS TORY!   The only thing I need to mention is that parking can be challenging, but you should be able to find street parking if the lots are full.  We highly recommend Joyride (either location), because they are great people, have great food, and really want to make your experience as positive as possible. If you haven't been, go!!",

    "text": "Now you may not know me personally, but I can personally vouch for myself as a taco - Tuesday connoisseur. This is one of my favorite spots for Taco Tuesday.   $2 tacos, $5 margs, some salsa on the side, and a happy Tuesday to all, and to all a good night.   HERE'S THE DOWNSIDE - everyone knows how good this taco Tuesday is, so you will likely wait for a table! Do not fear -- their happy hour is eerily similar to their taco Tuesday specials, so if you can get here for happy hour any other day, you should plan your entire life around this.   Enough about their specials, on to the food. The tacos are street-taco style, so a little smaller and great for sampling lots of different ones. I usually prefer flour tortillas, but the corn tortillas here are not bad. With that being said, I'm going to guide you towards the one taco that is on a flour tortilla anyway which is the Crispy Fish taco. The white magic sauce (I know it sounds a little fishy) is PERFECT on this taco. Definitely don't leave without ordering the Standard, since it got it's name for a reason.   MARGS ON MARGS.  I would suggest either getting the Joyride or the Prickly pear, but that is only because those are the two that I have tried and LOVED both. I think you'll be pretty happy with any of the choices. I have also tried the Agua Frescas (cucumber mint) and it really is quite refreshing.  They have a patio that is dog friendly (yay!) with heaters and a fireplace when its chilly outside. It does get pretty loud inside, so I try to stay outside.   My only issue with this place -- service can be hit or miss. I have had some amazing, attentive servers who have brought my dog water, recommended new food, and have just been truly on-point and others that seem to forget that they are working and hang out near the bar the entire time. BUT of all the servers, I have never had a reason not to come back.",

    "text": "3 visits to Joyride Taco House, 3 awesome experiences... Upward Projects continues to amaze me with their successful restaurant concepts and Joyride is no exception.  Joyride has a lot in common with sister restaurant (and another one of my faves), Postino.  They both have a casual, fun vibe, attentive and friendly service, indoor and outdoor seating, and stellar food and drinks.  I've been to Joyride twice with my husband and once for a girls' dinner, and each time has been awesome.  I am a huge fan of their chips and salsa... note: the first basket is free and each refill after that is $2.  Pretty good deal, but they know how to hook you; the chips are addicting!    Each time I've been there, I've ordered a different drink... a beer, a blood orange margarita, a cucumber serrano margarita, and my latest find and favorite of all is the cucumber mint agua fresca con booze!  I had it with tequila, but I bet it would also be good with vodka.  As for the food, it's all fresh and delicious, but some of my favorite menu items are: *the guacamole - who goes for chips and tacos without guac?! *the shrimp ceviche *the garden variety burrito  Believe it or not, I haven't ordered the tacos, but I'm sure you can't go wrong with those either... and there are plenty of options!  It's also worth noting that there is a kids' menu (I will be bringing the kids next time), and that the kitchen doesn't mind if you custom order a bit, ie: \"no cheese\" or \"add chicken.\"  Gotta love that!  If you haven't been to Joyride yet, I suggest you go immediately, especially if you can get there before 5pm daily for happy hour when many of the drinks and pitchers of beer are only $5.  Enjoy the ride!",

I particularly have been enjoying the fact that the soup is ever changing. The shotgun lunch special is great. 2 tacos and a side for $10. Must do it with soup or salad. They are sooo good. I hope they bring that potato soup back. The braised beef taco has so much going on for flavor. The carnitas are really good as well. If you're coming with more then one person and wanna share something, go with the nachos(a personal favorite). The staff is usually super friendly and upbeat. I understand when its super busy, you can get overwhelmed and frustrated, but they still tru their best to be upbeat. I really love the open window to the kitchen. Its funny watching the cooks have fun with each other. Overall a great place. If you don't like huge crowds and wait times try stopping in for lunch.",

    "text": "What a JoY! We went at 8:15 on a Friday night so of course it was packed.  We were quoted a 45 minute wait which is normal in Phoenix. The bar is huge with plenty of seats and easy to get a drink.  However, even better is the patio on the north side of the building, that is separate from the dining patio, and perfect for waiting.  There is plenty of seating, a few table, and a server dedicated to making sure you never are thirsty!  We found 3 seats right away, and they brought us a basket of fresh chips and salsa and waters to start while we looked over all the drinks.  Within minutes we all had margaritas in our hands and we were happy.  Very smart move Joyride.  The 45 minutes flew by because we could converse and drink and munch on chips the whole time.   We were greeted with the same friendliness when we were seated at our table in the dining room.  Again, waters and fresh chips and salsa right away.  Our drinks from earlier were effortlessly transferred to our dining bill, so there was no urgent need to close out with one server before being sat at our table.   We changed up our drinks inside and were impressed by each one we had.  All of the nectars and juices are house made which makes the drinks very fresh.  No bottled mixers or syrupy concoctions.  The house margarita was perfect.  Not sweet or overly tart.  Just refreshing.  The Blood Orange Margarita was a little sweeter but also delicious.  The Key Largo was something else.  Very pina colada-esque but better.  Whatever they used to rim the glass made the drink.  Everyone was impressed.   The food was very well done.  We stared with street corn, which was flavored well, but will probably be even better when corn is actually in season.  It just didn't have the sweet and juiciness that you get from corn on the cob in late summer.  Our friend had the tortilla soup with chicken which she said was fantastic and perfectly spiced. We all had tacos of course, although I was very tempted by the chilequilles.  Next time, maybe for lunch!  My favorite were the shrimp tacos.  Huge shrimp, great flavor, and NOT breaded!  The baja fish tacos were fantastic as well.  Finally a place that does grilled fish tacos well in Phoenix.  The braised beef taco was tender and juicy as well.  The tortillas are homemade and amazing and much larger than your typical street taco. Here is the one complaint I had about the food.  The side dishes were not up to par.  We had the pinto beans and the rice.  Both were pretty forgettable.  I am very surprised by this because Windsor, also an Upward Project restaurant, is known for their sides.  (hello Joe's church potatoes and mac n' cheese).  So next time we will try some other sides in hope of finding something better.  The sides are included when ordering 3 tacos, otherwise you really don't need them after all the chips and tacos! We usually skip desert because we are rarely impressed by restaurant deserts, and I for one would rather have another basket of chips and salsa.  I am a salt guy, not a sweets guy.  BUT, Better Than Betty's was one of the best desserts I have had at a restaurant in a really long time.  It was perfect to share by the way, even by 3 people.  The brownie was incredible...chewy inside and slightly crusty outside and just the slightest hint of spice that made it less Betty Crocker and more Nacho Libre!  Then there was a layer of caramel that was divine.  It had to be homemade.  And a huge scoop of dulce de leche ice cream that was definitely homemade.  As soon as we tasted it we knew they must have made it across the street at Churn.  If you have been there you know what I am talking about.  That smooth creamy homemade ice cream that is so dangerous because it is walking distance from my house.  Perfect.  Oh, and the candied pecans were a bonus.  They almost had a caramel corn flavor to them.  Anyways, the combination of flavors left us all speechless.   So if I had to make a recommendation for diners, it would be cocktails, 2 tacos each (which is very hard to narrow down from your choices) skip the sides, and dessert is a must! The place looks great and I can't wait for spring when they open up all the sliding windows and doors.   We have tried Taco Guild as well (see my review) and Joyride is 10x better and way more fun. I forgot to mention the service.  Everyone was so friendly and fun.  The servers inside at our table, and outside on the patio, were very helpful with recommendations and explanations.  We were never without drinks or chips and salsa or water.  Super attentive and just a great, laid back, easy vibe that is normal from these 4 neighborhood restaurants on this corner.  That is why we love them and keep coming back!  (it helps they are all walking distance too!)",

    "text": "I have one main criteria for rating any sort of \"mexican\" restaurant, and that is how they prepare the chicken.  Unfortunately, this place failed my test.  The chicken in the tacos merely tasted like chicken, and it was a sizable hunk of fairly dry breast that I had to chew through.  With all the stuff included in the taco, I still found myself reaching for the cholula  to give it some moisture and taste.  My tablemates had \"heat\" issues with the salsa that came with the chips and I have to admit I couldn't dunk as freely as I like.  A burrito ordered came smothered and I mean smothered in a green chili sauce (looked like typical salsa verde and not green chilis).  He had to scrape it all off.  So, the end result is I will probably not go back.  We were forced there by the huge crowd across the street at Postinos and apparently Joyride is owned by the same folks.  I guess if you charge high enough prices the undiscriminating crowd here in Phoenix will just assume it must be great.  Not me!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying, I would have rated Joyride a 4, but for one significant fact--the mixed drinks are a poor value. Nine dollars for a small glass that is filled with 75% ice just doesn't cut it. To top it off, they arrive with short straws (Disney made the 2nd and 3rd stories of Main Street buildings progressively smaller so you would think they were taller) which causes your drink to disappear even faster. When we ordered a third house Margarita and requested less ice, the bartender limited the ice but simply poured the drink shorter. I guess they have to pay for the exquisite decorations and furnishings somehow!   Joyride is cut in the new mold of restaurants intended for both seeing and being seen. Where the value of the meal you pay for is significantly in the theater of the atmosphere. Something you can't take home with you. That said, there's a lot of theater here, and it is very well done. Everything exudes quality. From the chairs, comfy and styled, to the decorations. Not a stone appears to have been unturned to create and resurrect images, colors and shapes evocative of childhood memories residing in the deepest recesses of baby boomer brains. It is outstanding. And the food is a decent value as well.   I had the carne asada burrito and my wife had the chicken tamale. Both very good and ample. the chips are great and the service attentive. In fact, I would say that the staff was a cut above the (low) average set by Fox Concept restaurants. Everyone from the greeter/hostess to the waitstaff and manager were solicitous and genuine (well as genuine as they have time to be). These are real people with a mission and vision instilled by the owners...not bimbos and bimbettes schooled in the fine art of maximizing (restaurant) revenue, minimizing expense and maximizing tip income.   So, Joyride delivers more than most theater restaurants: good value in food (both cost and quality), great surroundings (visually and in terms of comfort) but you pay for it in the cocktails. I suppose an alternate strategy would be to rely on beer. Or, if you don't drink beer, have one cocktail at home before coming over (but who wants to make a margarita at home, especially on a Friday night after work)...I have never found homemade ones to be that great. Joyride does offer a taller glass for an additional two dollars. Which I suppose has the amount of alcohol that the $9 one should have.  Also, as an earlier review warned, avoid the double trio of two person tables sandwiched together at either end of the lovely round booths. You will feel uncomfortable and untethered as the wait-staff traverses these thoroughfares (a feng-shui moment).  Even though you do end up paying more...you don't feel quite as cheated as at the other \"theme\" restaurants.",

You can imagine how excited we were when we heard they were opening a location here in Central Phoenix, just a couple of miles from our home. By opening weekend the staff seems to already have the routine down. We were quickly greeted when we walked in the door, and received excellent service throughout the night.   Drinks were good, but our favorites of the evening were the chips and salsa (one of the key elements for any Mexican restaurant), and the chicken enchiladas! I don't think I could say enough good things about the enchiladas. Excellent!!  We had another stop planned for the evening so we skipped dessert, but we will definitely be trying it on a future trip.   Our one complaint would have to be our table. We were unfortunate enough to be sat at one of three small tables for two. The tables are in a row and all right next to each other. We felt cramped and a little like we were joining our neighbors dinner party. All the other tables in the restaurant looked great though, next time we will make sure we aren't sat there.",

Hostess said 20 minute wait, but with a nice large bar we were able to find two open seats right away and avoid the masses who were lingering. I really dug the decor, and there looked to be lots of outdoor patio space to enjoy too. The house salsa was super flavorful and the chips were the wonderfully thin and crunchy type that I can't get enough of with my Mexican food. I ordered the Baja fish, Chicken Tinga and Cochinita Pibil tacos with the cucumber orange salad side. All of the tacos were great, but that simple, perfect salad was shear perfection. I want some now just thinking about it! Couple of good draft beer choices and what appeared to be a pretty extensive bar. I plan a return sometime soon for a specialty coctele or two!

Stick with the basics here.. Like tacos and fountain drinks or just water. I've had salads, tacos, dessert, burritos and margs here. I've liked nothing I've ordered besides the brownie and tacos. There is something missing about it all.  And the rule about filling up water glasses that are half full is a great rule! However, I was signing my check to leave and told our server that I didn't need anymore water as she grabbed it and told me it was a rule to fill up all water glasses... I agree that this rule is great for summers that hit 118 degrees, but when I am leaving and telling them not to fill my glass I think it's fair to leave my glass half empty. It's a waste of water, especially in the desert.",

Hubby and I went here for an early dinner/late lunch/craving prevention.  It was TACO TUESDAY!  So most tacos were only 2 dollars!!!  Jackpot!!! Winning!  One of each please! Thanks! Don't judge me. On the first go round, I ordered the Crispy fish, the carnitas, and the pork adobada.  Crispy fish was good.  Really tasty and the texture is to die for...That crunchy batter with the flour tortilla and just the right amount of white magic sauce was perfect.  Next up was the carnitas.  Now typically that's a go to for me, but this time is was just good.  It didn't blow my socks off or anything, but it was tasty.  3rd in line was the amazing ADOBADA!  It was SO good.  I think I did a little dance after my first bite.  I loved the flavor, the crunch of the radish and onion, the tons of juice dripping off the meat...Just do yourself a favor and get the adobada, you won't be disappointed!    We also got the guac as an appetizer, which was overpriced and kinda bland...It could've stood to use a bit more lime, garlic and salt...but the fresh chips kinda helped to salty it up a bit.  I also tried the churros which were good, but the chocolate sauce was blech!!!  I wasn't a fan AT ALL...I wish they served it with fresh whipped cream like they do as Paz :)  All in all it was a great experience!  We'll definitely be back!!!",

My favorite is actually getting the garden variety burrito in a bowl instead of a tortilla and it is, in my opinion, even tastier! I am a spice whimp so to me their salsa has a little bite afterward, but it has a great flavor so I always eat it any way. Their happy hour starts early (i believe 2pm to 6pm but taco tuesday I think is 2pm to 11pm) and the $2 tacos and $5 margaritas are super worth it during those times.",

    "text": "I met a friend here for lunch, she lives in Arcadia and I'm in Glendale, so we usually end up in Central Phoenix since it's about the same trip for both of us. Upon pulling into the parking lot I was already impressed, because unlike most places in the area, Joyride seems to remember that people do, in fact,  drive cars, and have a decent size parking lot with spots you can actually get into. I drive a Honda Civic and have had trouble squeezing into spots places around here before.   I work in the central phoenix area, and so I've noticed a few of the restaurants in the area are...well, let's not sugarcoat it they're overrun with judgemental hipsters who give you the side eye if you don't appear to be as hip as them. Never once in Joyride did I get a douchey hipster vibe from the staff. The guy who sat us and there were I believe two people who waited on us were super nice, very warm and friendly,  and made sure we had everything we needed.  And now we get to the best part. THE FOOD. I love food. I'm a fat kid at heart. I also love tacos. They asked us if we wanted to start with the queso dip and I was like, um yes please you can do no wrong when it comes to things with cheese. I was skeptical of it at first because I'm not a huge fan of super spicy stuff and it had jalapenos on top but once I dug in I was sold. It did have a nice kick to it but it wasn't hot just for hots sake. It was a flavor hot. We both got the three taco deal where you buy three tacos and get a side. I got black beans and she got the orange cucumber salad. Both amazing. The Carne Asada taco was pretty much the best thing I'd put in my mouth all day. The fish taco was a close second. The carnitas was also delicious but by this point I was too full to enjoy it properly but it was so good I ate it anyway.   Price wise it's decent. You're obviously going to pay more here than you would at like taco bell or something but for the queso dip, three tacos & sides, and a Corona each it was like $44. I feel that's a fair price for the quality grub you get.   So yeah. Go there.",

Vibe is cool for whatever your doing.   Ok so now for what's not good. The margaritas. They suck. They say they make their own mix but it all just tastes like sweet and sour mix. It's bad. There are far too many taco spots in the valley with $5 handmade margaritas. The wait. It's always packed on Tuesdays when the tacos are cheapest so there may be a wait. The chips and salsa. Snooze fest. Should be the best start and here most def not. Salsa way to hot and flavorless chips to hard.   I would go as it's close to home and those are some good ass $2 tacos the 3 of us ate for $22. Just drinking at the next spot.",

    "text": "OMG. Worse than bad on every level. Place seems fun when you first walk in. It was crowded and I liked the colorful retro-decor. We were seated at a pub table near the bar and promptly ignored. We sat there at least 15 minutes and finally someone came to take a drink order. I ordered a silver marg on the rocks with no salt. I was even specific about how if they accidentally make it with salt and then pour it into a non-salted glass, I can taste it and would need to have the margarita remade because I can't stand that taste of \"softened\" margarita. It happens frequently enough, so I always explain in advance with the hope that they'll be more aware, maybe make the bartender aware, and prevent a wasted margarita from being made in the first place. It matters because I order margs with more expensive tequila...I know they don't want to be throwing it away and that busy bartenders are on auto-pilot, dipping glasses in salt without thinking about it. Anywhoo, I saw my marg being made and then poured into a salted glass. I saw the bartender look at the ticket and then wipe the salt off the glass. Then the server came up and brought the drinks. I explained what I had just seen and tasted it anyway, then asked the server to have it remade without the salt. So...the same exact thing happened AGAIN. But this time, the server was standing at the bar and noticed the salt, and the bartender wiped the salt off and poured it into an unsalted glass. It was pretty entertaining, actually. The server promptly brought the revised version, which although I could still taste salt, I decided this was what I'm dealing with here (service-wise) and opted not to have it remade.  Food came out and was actually...terrible! Surprise. We LOVE Mexican food, and especially tacos, so we were so excited to eat here after leaving some snob-joint in \"Scottsdale-adjacent\" (Biltmore, ugh) before finding this place on Yelp. With all the great reviews, we thought we had found a gem. Food was bad, cold, late, incorrect; and the service was WORSE. When the check came, it was the wrong one. Look, I KNOW these are first-world problems! I get it. And I sound like a whiny diva, I know. But how can a restaurant screw up every possible thing, from start to finish? It's too bizarre, and not worthy of giving another try because even if we get better service, the food isn't going to improve.   Two stars because the manager took off like $15 or some relatively insignificant amount from our bill. And yes, we did finally get the correct bill, paid it, and survived the entire traumatic incident. Everyone wins! : )",

    "text": "Was really craving tacos for dinner and was trying to decide this place or Tacos Guild. Ended up choosing this taco place because of the margarita selection.    Margaritas - We ended up ordering the Blood Orange, Prickly Pear and Cucumber Serrano.  Here's my ratings for those:  Blood Orange: 5 out of 10 - it was way too sweet and it hardly tasted like what I expected of a blood orange. Semi pulpy, yet very sugary and sweet. Not my fave.  Prickly Pear: 5 out of 10 - I was expecting a deeper taste of prickly pear but this one was a miss as well. It really lacked that nice pear taste that I've had before at other places.    Cucumber Seranno: 6 out of 10 - after drinking the sweet blood orange, I needed something less sweet for sure as was referred this. Has a strong cucumber taste and the serrano heat was very light and tingly. The overall drink waswas refreshing. I'd probably order it again with one more shot of tequila.  Tacos -   The little tacos we excellent. We ordered the shrimp, crispy fish, adobada, and carne asada. The snall little tacos were packed with flavor. The crispy fish was on point. Fish was nice and crispy, plus the sauce was flavorful. The shrimp taco was also cooked very well and seasoned with flavor. Carne asada and adobada both were delicious and topped with a pickled raddish slaw. The carne asada almost had a taste similar to a BBQ bahn mi sandwich. Overall, great tacos except a little pricey. I can get these flavors in Mexico, however we're at a restaurant in Phoenix so the price is understandable. Another plus is that they offer the first round of chips and salsa on the house. So yeah good deal.  AC",

You really have to get the crispy fish taco and experience that yourself. It was so flavorful and the fish tasted pretty fresh. The maja fish taco didn't taste as good as I expected... not as much flavor there. And the chicken tinga taco was also packed with flavor, but similarly tasting elsewhere.  There's happy hour which ends at 6pm during the weekdays.. which brings me to why this wasn't a 4-star for me, personally. Maybe it was just crowded the day I came or that my waiter didn't pay much attention, but I ordered at 5:30pm, hoping it was still happy hour prices, but unfortunately, it was not. So overall, it seems kinda pricey (without happy hour) for a-okay tacos- except that crispy fish taco. THAT was definitely worth it.",

The food is wonderful, fresh and quick with gluten free and vegetarian options throughout the menu. In comparison to traditional Mexican food places in the area, the prices are a bit higher.  The guacamole is a must. So fresh. I've personally had the veggie tacos and the Fila Salad, both of which are amazing. I think you get more for your money with the Fila Salad (pictured).

I have had tacos from many places, but this place definitely stands out.    After being seated, we gave our drink orders and I was pleased by the variety of margarita options, such as Blood Orange, Tropicale, Prickly Pear, Strawberry Hibiscus and Pineapple Mojito.  There wasn't a flavor I didn't enjoy, though some were definitely sweeter than others and they weren't the strongest I've had.    Now, these tacos... carnita, fish, chicken... every taco I had was full of so much flavor and so enjoyable.  Do you want quality tacos?  Come to this place.  On Taco Tuesday, they're $2 all day and night and the margaritas are $5 all day and night.    If you're in the area, don't question it.  Just go.  Explore some local stores while you wait.",

I probably should've ordered a regular marg but even most specialty margs have a kick. I got the lunch special with two veggie tacos with rice. I'm vegetarian so I'm always excited to find good veggie tacos but unfortunately these were very bland. The veggies were lightly roasted at best, and had no seasoning whatsoever. I just asked for a side of salsa to dump on them to get some flavor. There are plenty of other restaurants in PHX that have incredible veggie tacos. Next time I come here I'll just get a quesadilla!",

We ordered three tacos with the slaw as well as the green Chile burrito and the churro sundae.  Pretty disappointed and not what I was expecting.  There are many, more authentic Mexican food spots in Phoenix.  The way I would describe this place is Mexican food without the soul or in other words, Mexican food in appearance only.",

Greeter told me to use yelp to save our place in line. Did that so by the time we walked there from our place, our table was ready. Yay!  Our server was friendly, fast, and just generally on his game--as is every server here.   Food is always good. Not great, but good. My husband didn't love his shrimp taco (shrimp was kind of over cooked and fishy) but everything else was good.   Beer was really cold. We always love their $5 before 5, 7 days a week.

    "text": "What promised to be a Joyride turned out to be more like a ride from hell.  Upon arrival the hostess put us on the wait list and said it would be 15-20 minutes. We confirmed we'd wait and sat down right in front of her at the chairs provided for this purpose.   Fast forward 25 minutes and we decide to check in, which required standing up and walking maybe two feet to say hello. Here's where things got weird: she alerted us that she had \"forgot\" us and \"thought you left\" so she took us off the wait list.  Restaurants are busy, I get that. But it was still perplexing to hear someone say she thought you'd left when you'd been in her line of sight for nearly half an hour.   Once sat at a table, the hits just kept coming. There were plates set but no napkins or utensils. They brought the complimentary chips and salsa (nothing to write home about, but not inherently bad) and I asked for utensils to the food runner who delivered it. He nodded and smiled, the vacant eyes promising our request would go unfulfilled. It did.   Ultimately my boyfriend needed to walk over to the POS station and grab utensils and napkins out of a basket. Forks only. What luck. To this day we don't know where they keep the knives.  When it came to the food, it  was more of the same. I ordered a chicken burrito and was brought a chicken bowl. By that point we had more or less written off complaining and decided we'd just grin and bear it and get out of there. The waitress was very apologetic once she discovered the mishap and delivered the proper item, so in the end we were left with two underwhelming chicken entrees.   My boyfriend's tacos were mas o menos. The carnitas being the standout amongst an otherwise average rendition of beef and chicken.   At this point mentioning the margarita mishap would come off as petty.  Pros: free chips and salsa. Not terrible decor.   Bottom line: The mediocre food is not compelling enough to make us want to take a second chance on the confused service, and the service isn't exceptional enough to make us settle for uninspired food.",

Everyone did a variety of the tacos ($2 on Tuesdays) and all in all I think everyone enjoyed them. There was a good variety of margaritas to choose from.

My last 4 visits have been very underwhelming, I thought after the first time I had a bad experience (cold grisly carne asada) they were just having an off night. I came back a second time same issue with the carne asada & the recipe had definitely changed. Third time was just an overall bad experience, it took a long time to get drinks & the server kept forgetting about us (which she jokingly admitted more than once) so I just left. Fourth time I just came for happy hour, ordered one taco with carne that I couldn't really chew (why didn't I learn my lesson) drank my beer & spent my money elsewhere. I also always just watched my food sitting for 5-10 minutes at a time before anyone brought it to my table.  The employees are very nice for the most part and the restaurant has a beautiful atmosphere. It honestly bums me out that it's not as good as it once was, they honestly had some of the best carne asada around NO JOKE. Hopefully this place can be restored to its former glory.",

I wish I could have sat there and sipped margaritas all day and not gone back to work.  We were sat right away and given water and a great bowl of crunchy chips and savory salsa.  I ordered Iced tea and I swear it was the best Iced tea I have ever had.  Not usually something I would put in a yelp review.  Bring ur own straw tho, yeah they're like that but who cares!  At least they didn't t give those gross paper straws.  They have a Shotgun Special for lunch that is any two tacos and a side or half salad for $9.95.  I had a grilled fish taco and a battered fish taco.  Both exceeded my expectations, I will prob go two grilled next time tho.  My half salad wasn't just a garden salad but half of one of their signature salads.  It had thin slices of kale and chunks of avocados with jicama, cheese, ripe tomatoes and a few other things that made it probably the best salad I have ever had.  I will def be back to this rockin taco shop.  I loved sitting there enjoying the music and great service!!!  Best fish tacos I have had in Arizona.",

From vegetarian to carne asada they have you covered. At $3.50-$4.75 they're not the cheapest around but order three and get a side for $1(I recommend the bomb black beans). The shrimp taco with Mexican slaw and pico gringo and chicken tinga taco are always my go to's and I would also highly recommend the Baja fish if you want something lighter but still tasty. The Beast burrito and the Machaca burrito are great if you want something hearty and delicious. Order them as a bowl or chimi style at no additional charge.",

To start, it was our dad's retirement and there was a group of 9 of us. We had reservations and they sat us on time which was great, however the service goes down from there. We waited over 20 minutes for our server to come back once he took all the drink orders and we were missing margaritas. When we mentioned it it took maybe 10 min or so for the missing one to come to the table. No one came by to refill our ice tea or lemonade either. And it was impossible even ordering another beverage once ours ran out because we barely saw our server. I like how everyone works as a team, clearing plates/serving the food but it was just a complete mess. Two of the orders were messed up, the \"Christmas\" enchilada style came as a burrito and then the bowl came as a burrito. When we told the server, they brought us the side of the enchilada sauce? Like didn't offer to warm it up or melt the cheese on the enchilada like we ordered but just literally brought a bowl of sauce. We never got the bowl fixed, just picked it out of the tortilla because we didn't want to have to wait on that... again. We spent over $180 and just the fact we had to hunt people down for everything i.e. to go boxes, weren't offered drink refills, can we order another drink, this order is wrong and so on it was just an embarrassment that we wanted to come here to bad and this is what they had to show. The retiree did like his fish tacos tho, but that's about it.",

However, in downtown Gilbert you kind of can't get away from long lines no matter where you go so I can't hold that against joy ride. So, the only real drawback that remains is the price. It is definitely way more expesive than a lot of other great taco places. You don't even get chip refills on top of already step food prices.    But having said that! That food is really good. They have one dish here that I really love and haven't found something comparable to. It is the veggie enchiladas with goat cheese. They are so good! I am not a vegetarian but I would still pick these over pretty much anything else. YUM! Their burritos are also good from what I have tried but man those enchiladas.",

    "text": "I had been hearing great things about this place for quite some time. I checked it out on Yelp and the place looked promising. My husband and I had been longing for a date night for quite some time. We came here at around 4:30 on a Saturday. It was quite busy. Good sign? Not really. I'm quite confused as to why so many people gave it good reviews. We ordered the $10 cheese y mas appetizer. And it felt like dipping a chip into a nacho cheese gordita (sans the pita) from Taco Bell. Wtf??? Tacos are lackluster to say the least. Over priced and underdeveloped. I ordered 1 chicken tinga, 1 pork adobo, 1 braised beef. I couldn't distinguish the difference between the pork and beef tacos. Bland. Service was really slow and most of the staff seemed annoyed or in foul moods. I'll take my chances and stick to the taco food trucks. Cheaper and more flavorful. I suggest people check out La Santisima for a better version of trendier Mexican \"street tacos\". Won't be returning for sure.",

    "text": "The ball & chain and I stopped by for the first time last week. The place has a nice set up and everything looks very nice inside. That's probably the best thing I can say. The waitress took about 15 minutes to take our order and then when she did she left for another 5 because she didn't have a pen. And the restaurant was only 3/4 full. We ordered some queso appetizer and it was decent but you get better stuff at Taco Bell. And the food portions are ridiculous. I'm a math nerd so I figured it out. The tacos are $4 each (yes $4 each, I know wtf, right!!) and being a big guy (I'm a toned 6'3 225 lbs beast) I can finish these tacos in 3 bites which comes out to $1.33 per bite. That's pathetic and you don't get full unless you order like 6 tacos if you are a big dude my size. The taste was less than good. I don't know why they get so many good reviews. The place is not good at all. Maybe it's because I have actually tried Mexican tacos in Mexico that I know what tacos should taste like. The service is pretty bad too. From the waitress to the bus boys. I guess they think they are better than what they are, but guess what? Get real because you work at a restaurant and you are not better than anyone. We are all the same and bus boys should not think they are better than you. Ok sorry my rant is over! Don't come here!!",

    "text": "Seriously disappointed. First time here about a month ago and I was underwhelmed across the board. We were seated immediately on the patio and water and chips/salsa appeared quickly but everything after that was missed. Took a long time to be greeted by a server and even longer to get our appetizer-shrimp ceviche. App included full size pieces of shrimp that should have been diced up. Tables that arrived after we did received their food first. I ordered the machaca burrito served enchilada style with red sauce. My boyfriend got The Beast burrito. When The Beast is smaller than a Chipotle burrito and contains less meat, the name should probably be changed. I tried both & wasn't impressed with either. Everything was just okay. Which would have made this a three star review except for one problem. They never cleared any plates or glasses. Every time they would bring us a fresh drink or the next \"course\" they would leave the former dishes on the table. It was a small table so we were running out of room. We asked one of the many servers (they work as a \"team\" -a concept I still don't understand because it doesn't seem to work, at any restaurant, and the tip likely gets split but what if one person is excellent and another on the team is terrible?) to clear the table, he said he would \"be right back\"...he never came back. Walked past us a few times but clearly had forgotten our request. They still weren't cleared when we paid the check! There must have been 10 used dishes on the table when we left. I don't plan on returning to Joyride. Too many other great restaurants nearby, Windsor and St. Francis among them!",

Went here for Easter lunch and had no problems getting in and there was plenty of parking that I couldn't park my own car into.  You can get plenty of food for under $10 but most likely will go over 10 per person especially if you're getting alcohol.  House margarita was tasty. No need to go top-shelf, but that have that too. Overall a bit on the pricey side for Mexican, but you're paying for location and the swank ambiance. The free salsa is good. I tried the un-free habanero salsa (they let me try it for free thankfully) and didn't like it.  So before you buy the un-free salsas ask for a taste.",

    "text": "Unacceptable cold food and strange service model. Went to Joyride for dinner with my young children, wife and mother in law on Sunday night at 6:30. We were seated promptly in a booth, which was nice.  Friendly waiter introduced himself and took our drink order. Ordered mild guac with no chilis for the kids. Different server brought drinks and another brought guac with lots of sliced jalapenos on top. Had to pick them out. Thankfully no chilis in the guac so we didn't say anything. We waited 30 more minutes for the entrees to come out. Much like other reviewers, different person brought us each couple plates and drinks - very strange. When the entrees finally came the food was cold. I almost never complain or send food back. But when the Mexican corn came (arrived before the entrees) it was cold. We took a bite and asked to send it back. We asked someone who wasn't our server but hadn't seen him so didn't wait (entrees still not arrived so even more strange we were receiving a side so long before entrees). Grilled corn on the cob shouldn't be cold. I don't mean room temp because they plated it too early before they brought it to our table - it was clearly prepped/cooked some time long ago, refrigerated and then brought to us without re-grilling or warming for us. It was actually cold. The person we spoke with agreed and brought back another cold piece of corn. Not sure if it was the same one but it was clearly cold too - not even warmed. Irritated at this point. Then the entrees arrived. The braised beef taco was the same - not just room temp but was literally refrigerated cold, chilly to the touch. Cold beef in a supposedly warm dish is completely unacceptable. Fried fish taco was crispy but room temp at best. BTW - I understand how restaurants work. I don't expect them to be braising new beef in real time just for me. But if you're going to make it yesterday and serve it to me today, warm it in a pan/on a flat top or even put it under a heat lamp... something!!  At least pretend to serve freshly prepared food! Grilled shrimp in the shrimp taco was the same - clearly cooked some time very long ago and then topped for us but not even remotely warm.  After waiting so long and being served inedible entrees, the kids were tired and we were irritated and weren't going to wait any longer. We spoke with the manager and asked him to please give us some fresh, warm food to go - we were there for nearly an hour and we had had enough. I understand that lots of people like the cheap taco Tuesday deal at this place... But this was a really disappointing experience. Be warned. If you're not going for cheap drinks and drunk food, beware... You may get some very modestly re-heated corn and cold meat tacos.  This experience was all the more disappointing because we are huge fans of Postino and Churn. This was a fail from start to finish.",

The beans were delicious.   The carnitas was my favorite taco. Good pork flavor and the avocado slice complimented it well.  The crispy fish taco was alright. The fish itself was good, I just would have preferred it with a corn tortilla, and the condiments on it didn't really do anything for me.   The carne asada was my least favorite. The meat was bland. It didn't taste like it was marinated or anything.   The complimentary salsa that came with the chips was tasty but the chips themselves were too salty for my taste.   They were pretty crowded and busy, but service was ok. The restaurant has a nice open layout and they do play decent music, but I was annoyed by flies during my meal. I sat inside but they had all the doors open since the weather was nice and I had to keep shooing them away from my food. Kind of annoying.   Overall this place wasn't bad, but I wasn't blown away by the food either. I don't think I'd go back on my own, but if someone invited me to go there with them, I wouldn't decline.",

I would get any drink, aside from the prickly pear margarita unless you like super sweet, but the off menu naked and famous is probably the best cocktail in town if you like a smoky mezcal!   The food is all great but I always end up doing a taco plate, 3 tacos and a side with the great chips and salsa and you are set!  The trick is picking just 3 of the tacos!  My favorite hands down and always in the line up is the braised beef, and you can't go wrong with the standard, the chicken tinga, the pork adobada or the carnitas!  The side is another tough choice, they are all good, but the top 3 for me are the roasted veggies, the bomb black beans, and the orange cucumber salad for something a little more fresh and lite!  Great for a date or a night with friends!",

A table came in 10 minutes after we got here and got asked what they wanted to eat within five minutes of being there yet I had to wait longer than that for a sofa. Our server wasn't at all concerned with my table. Not to mention that it took another fifteen minutes for us to get cashed out because again, lack of concern.",

The concept is great and the atmosphere is good.. even the bar seating (which is extensive) is comfortable) Service could be much  improved...come on it took forever to get a bottle of beer....the burrito...carne asada.. not much flavor..meat was tough and the various other ingredients just didnt play well with each other...very dry...when I want a burrito grilled on one side..I will say so.. ..overall I think they are trying to hard....",

    "text": "Pretty delicious! We've tried the gilbert location when they first opened and liked it, so we knew it would be good. We came here with another couple to have some drinks and tacos. And boy did we have those drinks and tacos! Lol $58 dollars later, full of tacos and with a tipsy boyfriend it was time to head out. We tried the carnitas, shrimp, carne asada, and crispy fish tacos. All of them were seriously good. My malibu and pineapple drink wasn't something I'd order again...it tasted like I was drinking flowers, it was odd. But my man drank that along with his two long island iced teas which he said was different but still good. Fyi, in the 5 years we've been together I've never seen this man order anything but a good quality beer, so that was strange! After some hilarious and raunchy wonderings of what \"white magic\" was (remember, tipsy people) we learned it was a delicious lime aioli-baja type sauce. MmmmmMm. Also their chips and salsa are sooooo good! We basically all filled up on that before dinner. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that their sides are very disappointing, nothing special about them at all and everything is a bit pricey here. We'd definitely be back. This is a perfect place for yummy food while you're having some drinks with great friends.",

    "text": "On first arriving, I was really confused by the parking situation.. I was informed by the valet guys that I was not supposed to enter off of Central?!? and that I could not park myself even though the lot was empty...?  My party was seated right away. The place is so dimly lit that the two older folks I had with me complained they couldn't see. Haha, old people. I could see fine, but it was a hair too dark and one measly table candle didn't help much. The salsa that came out with the chips was smoky chipotle and not good to me, instead of offering to bring me a replacement when I asked about other options, the waitress suggested that I buy other types of salsa :( rude. I did and I wasn't impressed with those either.  I had The Standard tacos, they were very good. One person in my group got the carne asada tacos and mouth fulls of fat, I guess the chef didn't trim it close enough. They excluded his meal from the bill :) The hipster staff was indistinguishable from the patrons, they also weren't the friendliest servers I've had either.  The atmosphere was fun though, and a nice contrast to the neighboring restaurants. I think this place would make a better bar than restaurant. I am a local, and if I'm looking for great tacos, I'm not going here, there are lots of other places in town with way better mexican food. I would come here again for drinks and atmosphere, and maybe a taco to offset the alcohol ;)",

This is a trendy hipster place with $4 street tacos and $9 margaritas light on liquor. I am a small female and I easily ate  3 tacos. Tacos came with a side at no charge. I ordered the orange cucumber salad which was obviously made the previous day. Soggy, definitely not fresh and I believe the orange slices were canned. Our bill was almost $70 and I felt like my husband and I had nothing special. I saw a roach inside as we were leaving. The beautiful huge tree out front and fun string lights would be my most compelling reasons to return.",

The black beans were bland and did not impress at all.  I also got the tortilla soup but it had a funny taste to it. Not sure about that.  I did enjoy my house margarita though!  The service was great, but we were asked if everything was ok by 3 different people and if we liked out food by two of the staff (a little much). The ambiance and decor was beautiful.  I guess I wasn't impressed enough to rush back there, but I could go back (maybe).",

The staff was impressive. I told them that I was meeting people and we needed to be able to talk, she selected a table that let us sit closer to each other. And when one of my dining companions knocked a glass bottle of hot sauce off the table and broke it, the staff was over in the flash and cleaned it up in under two minutes.

Seemed like a busy place however if you're not interested in hooking up and getting wasted then the staff might blow you off.  Food is average and drinks are really expensive I'm not from the area so maybe pricing is part with the community its but I felt portions on tacos and drinks were not price appropriate.  On another note if you're looking for something sweet Creamistry is right around the corner and really good.  If I'm in town earlier in the day I'd give them another shot I know it was a busy Thursday night and I was just in for a quick bite but got horrible service.",

The server was great at accommodating our group - we were able to pay with several credit cards + cash as long as we divided up the items ourselves.  The only reason I wouldn't give this place 5 stars is because when I called to make the reservation for 10, the manager gave me grief that my party would be arriving & leaving at varied times, and pushed back because 'the restaurant is busy at 4:30'.  At 4:30 when I arrived, half the restaurant was empty and there wasn't a wait until shortly before 6:30, when we wrapped up and left.  I was disappointed at the attitude that a party of 10+ wouldn't be welcomed with open arms.

    "text": "This is the second time I come here and have had the pleasure in having Desiree take care of my friends and I as our server! She has such great energy and an amazing personality which you don't see too much of nowadays (especially on a super busy night like Taco Tuesday). Both times, we waited 45 minutes (maybe less) on a table for 3 inside. Luckily, they have an extended patio area outside where you are able to put in an order for a drink or a snack while you wait. Desiree went out of her way to always continuously check on us and make sure we had a drink in hand and tend to our every need. I don't know how, but we always fall for drinks, tacos, and dessert every time with her suggestion! The food I do have to say is somewhat under seasoned (nothing some salsa and salt/pepper can't fix), however the service makes up for it. I think we found our favorite new Taco Tuesday spot!",

First off, the server handed me water cups and asked ME to \"pass them down\" to my friends - why am I doing your job bro? Secondly, my friend ordered a shot of tequila $7 for our table - but she tried to charge us for patron shots which were $10 each. Luckily we caught it and corrected it! Thirdly, we all just ordered margaritas and literally one taco each. It took them an hour for us to get our food!! When we bit into our taco it was lukewarm.... fourthly, the waitress took 30 min to close us out. She took all of our credit cards and cash and helped 4 different tables before checking us out. I will never go back here again.",

We were told the wait was about 25-30 mins but I think we ended up waiting closer to an hour to be seated.   Within two seconds we were given glasses of water and our order was taken by someone else, and then we had two other people check on us to see if we had ordered because the service was that quick and attentive. We ordered the bloody orange margaritas ($5) and 3 tacos per person for $2 each - I got the veggie, chicken tinga, and the standard. The bloody orange marg honestly just tasted like straight tequila, it was almost impossible for me to drink. The tacos were okay, I definitely wouldn't say they're great or worth more than the $2 happy hour deal. The highlight was without a doubt the fresh chips and salsa!   The restaurant itself is very modern and has super cute decor and accents. Despite being full to the brim, it wasn't too loud or rowdy.",

During happy hour, select tacos are $2 each and margaritas are $5; such a steal!!! I ordered the cucumber Serrano margarita, which is definitely my favorite because there is a nice kick but also a cooling effect from the cucumber. For my tacos, I ordered the pork Adobada, crispy fish, and chicken Tinga. I would definitely recommend both the pork adobada, which is so savory and flavorful with some smokiness from the guajillo chili, and the crispy fish, which is fried very well till crunchy and topped with creamy guac, pick, and some white sauce. My boyfriend ordered the crispy fish, carne asada, and the standard. He liked the carne asada but chose the crispy fish as his favorite. I love coming to joyride not only for the food, but service is always amazing and the restaurant is super cute as well. Make sure to check this restaurant out for som great food and drinks!",

The service can be a bit slow at times and the portions are a little light, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.  Very good place to get new style Mexican!",

The staff recommended the fried fish taco and it was delicious. If you order 3 tacos you can order a side dish for $1. We got the Mexican slaw. It seemed to have a secret ingredient in it... maybe orange zest? Anyway, very refreshing bowl of fresh crunchy veggies. I was impressed with the non-alcoholic beverages selection. I enjoyed a almond horchata. It was a little on the sweet side for my taste but delicious! Love this central location.",

Lately, I find myself picking fatty pieces of meat out of my taco!  The taco corn tortilla, has been inconsistent, sometimes it's hot and pliable, and other times, cold and \"not cooked or warmed.\" The chips are thick and not great, the guacamole is okay, but for $8.00 I've had so much better! They took away the shrimp ceviche on their menu, that was disappointing, it was really good! The drinks are great, as well as the service! Love the atmosphere, I just feel the food has taken a big dive. Sad, I've had many great years of enjoying Joy Ride, please improve your quality again!!!",

The margarita was also great, even though I got the prickly pear it didn't feel as though all I was drinking was juice and as you can see they're fairly big portions. The free chips and salsa also had a lot of flavor, slightly too spicy for me so I opt for some fresh pico instead. I would definitely suggest visiting if you're in Phoenix.   There is tons of parking and the inside has a nice atmosphere as well.",

It doesn't have to be a boring \"mom taco\" RE: cheese, lettuce, ground beat and tomatoes. My favorites on the menu are the fish taco and veggie taco. I don't know what the secret is behind these bad boys, but they are incredible.   Joyride Taco House not only serves up fresh tacos with a punch of flavor but their margs and their decor is spot on, too.   If you aren't feeling tacos go for the quesadilla. Normally, these come at a decent size from any other restaurant, but not here. These quesadillas are ENORMOUS. Moral of the story, come hungry.   I hope Joyride Taco expands to Charlotte, NC because I could really use some of these tacos in my life on the weekly.",

I especially love joyride during happy hour. great deals and great steals for great meals and great feels.   the place is always poppin. thus, if you come at a busy time, you may need to endure a wait for a table, but just go to the bar and grab a drink bc alcohol will solve this particular problem.   depending on how hungry i am, i either go for three tacos or the beast burrito. the tacos i choose are always the carne asada, the carnitas, and the crispy fish. never been disappointed. the beast burrito though is super tasty. steak + pinto beans + the white magic = bang bang ba-boom boom.   overall, this place is fun for friends or dates or families, and its a good way to spend your money.  you know the game, its hella flame, and it'd be a hella shame if you were hella lame and didn't respect the name and step in the frame. yawk, yawk",

You'd think that would be easy to accomplish at joyride but that wasn't the case.   17 minutes after sitting down Sam came by to get our drink order. Now he was around prior just not at our table. In that time I had total waiter envy.   It finally came, my prickly pear marg so I ordered a second before my elusive waiter disappeared again. We finally got food (another waiter brought it) and our second drink and bill arrived. Love the crispy fish and adoboda tacos but carne asada was way over cooked.   I'll just go other places in such a hot market. Too bad. I'd recommend you do the same in case you get Sam  After my first review Shelby contacted me and asked me to please give Joyride another shot. So I did.   Yet another Friday and I went back this time with my mother and daughter to try it again. I have to say the service was spot on. From the moment we arrived till we left. Even Sam waited on us and he was great.   Ok I'd recommend Joyride",

It's a little disappointing that all of their beans and rice are not vegan friendly. It would open up way more of the menu options to vegans if it was, and on this side of town i feel like that's a no-brainer.  The real reason why i'm writing this review was because the only thing that kept me returning to Joyride was their amazing salsa! Really disappointed to hear that they changed the recipe to a much less exciting salsa. I took my friend here, absolutely gushing about how amazing the salsa would be but found myself apologetic for the very OK food, (not spicy at all and also tacos were served without limes) and the radio top 40's blaring over the speakers were driving us nuts. The place is very trendy but it makes the atmosphere feel very much like an American lunch joint and not like a Mexican restaurant.  Redeeming qualities: the servers are all VERY nice and attentive.",

A somewhat trendy taco bar with lots of different flavors on the menu like the blood orange margarita and some interesting salsas.  We had the queso which was pretty good but since I had just left Austin it wasn't up to the standard of which I had before, still we devoured it since we're from LA and can't even get mediocre queso.. We had a trio of taco plates in which I had chicken and carne asada, my girlfriend tried the fish (which she sent back because it was too fishy) and another suggestion from the waiter which were both amazing.  Ambience was nice for a Tuesday evening and we got served fairly quickly. I would definitely say to come give a try but it's a little too fancy for my liking. I enjoyed the food but I am such a nut for legit street food and taking the gamble on what I get. I would still go here for their great food and polite staff though.",

I had been to another new taco restaurant the night before, but the salsa at joyride is far, far more flavorful.  We order right away, nachos, recommended by Lori. My husband loved them!  I order carne asada torta it was absolutely perfect. My husband got chicken tacos. Very good.  Lori also told us that Joyride has a kids plate. Perfect!  A another helpful young lady brought over a adorable kid friendly plate with two chicken tacos, fruit and I order a side of bomb black beans, which my daughter loved!  Great service, everyone who works there was very  friendly and seemed eager to please there customers.  I can't wait for our next  visit back to Joyride.",

I love tude of the staff. All very chill & helpful to give you their take on what they like. which I like. I also love that they had Four Peaks Ode Lay & loved it even better before 5 as it was happy hour priced. Sadly they are out of that now & are serving another Four Peaks beer which I will try when I stop stomping my feet about the Ode Lay loss. :)",

    "text": "Joy for Joyride! I'm obsessed with the food, especially the \"standard\" taco, which is really sort of a misnomer because there is nothing basic about it.  It's flavorful and divine! Nothing here is greasy or overdone-- the food is fresh and light but very, very tasty.  I also love the carnitas taco, and the cheese dip appetizer is to die for.  It's topped with fresh jalapenos, other peppers, and tomatoes/ onions.  Soooooo yummy.    The atmosphere is casual, fun, and very social.  I also love that it's a Mexican joint but they play great indie tunes.  No mariachi! My only complaint about the layout is the seating in the lounge patio where you wait for your table.  There are these little poof seats that put your arse right at the same height as the table and they're uncomfortable.  Yes, this is a very picky little thing but I'm trying to keep myself honest and not just give an all-glowing review.  If you love fresh and light Mexican food, give Joyride a try!",

    "text": "Not a bad place, just not up to par with their other offerings like Windsor and Federal Pizza. I've been twice now, and tried several of their tacos. I think the Cochinita Pibil was my favorite so far, and the sweetness of the pineapple made it stand out. None of the tacos were bad, but no other ones particularly stood out.  On my first trip I had the Cucumber Serrano cocktail, which I quite liked. On the second trip I went with the house margaritas, which were pretty nice by house marg standards.  The decor was nice, and the service was good both times, so no real complaints there. But if you're in that area looking for a tasty, relaxing bite and a drink I think you'll do better at Postinos overall.",

As they placed the complimentary chips and salsa on our table the chips seemed to be hard/stale which was surprising to everyone I was with. Although management did come and apologize which was very thoughtful he did inform us that there were no batches of chips that weren't stale, which we found super odd? How does that happen?",

Properly cooked.   I've always had good experiences with the different servers here. I'm impressed that so many of them seem able to recognize returning customers with ease. I'm also impressed that all of the servers and runners seem to pitch in and help one another.  In addition to Hannah, there are 3-4 male servers (one looks like a biker and 2 seem to always wear shirts that match each other), are really good humans.  I am over the Taco Tuesday madness. I get it for 20-somethings and maybe even 30-somethings that the idea of gathering with friends to pound a zillion tacos and wash them down with mighty tasty $5 margs made to order might be fun. Those days are done for me. I don't need to wait 60+ minutes to be seated via a text message system that doesn't always work just to be packed in like sardines and be treated to front-row rock concert level music noise. Depending upon what you order, their \"normal\" menu prices for items other than tacos makes the tab roughly the same.  So, for me, it's any night other than Tuesday night and I'll be very happy here.  Oh, and the brownie dessert? Heck to the Yes! The only way they make dessert any better is to use the ice cream from Churn. Same owner so I don't get why they don't do this.",

    "text": "Came here to celebrate Cinco De Mayo with some friends and family and we all loved it!  Location & Aesthetics - located on the corner N. Central Ave & W. Colter St and not difficult to miss with its great signage. There are lots of available parking in the rear of the restaurant and on W. Colter St.  The parking on W. Colter St is probably by chance as we were lucky to arrive just in time when two vehicles were pulling out.  If you can't find a spot on W. Colter St, you're sure to find something in the rear where there's lots of parking. The interior decor is beautifully decorated with lots of space and enough seating for any sized party.  Lots of comfortable outdoor seating -- couches, tables, and chairs with cool misters.  If you have to wait, like we did, you aren't even ignored outside as you are immediately provided with a complimentary basket of chips and salsa, and your drink orders are taken.  I find that to be absolutely cool because you can sit and enjoy your company, enjoy the atmosphere, the music while waiting for a table to become available.  Wait times weren't bad either as we were told about 30-45 minutes (it was Friday evening and Cinco De Mayo too), and that timing was pretty close.  Be sure to keep an eye on your phone as they will message you to let you know that your table is ready!  Menus - when you're sitting outside and waiting, there are available menus everywhere so you can familiarize yourself with what you will be ordering once you're seated inside plus you could familiarize yourself with the drinks portion of the menu as well.  The menu wasn't extensive and every easy to read and understand, and spanned about a page on both sides.  The same applied to the drinks menu as well.  Waitstaff was happy to answer any questions we had on either menus.  Service - very prompt and attentive.  Immediately as we sat outside, and even inside, our table had a complimentary basket of salsa and dip, and we were asked if we wanted to order from the drinks menu (outside) and the same inside.  Drinks were brought to our tables quickly including the food.  Waitstaff frequently visited us -- when outside and inside to assess our needs.  Staff could not have been more pleasant to deal with as they always showed up friendly, courteous, and with big smile.  Food - I had the tacos -- pork adobada (guajillo chili braised pork, cabbage, cilantro, radish + onion), carne asada (certified angus beef, fire-roasted salsa, cabbage, cilantro + onion), and the shrimp (grilled shrimp, Mexican slaw + pico gringo).  All tacos were prepared wonderfully -- very tasty, warm, flavorful, and even the corn tortillas they were served in was fresh.  Definitely cannot complain about the food! The complimentary basket of chips and salsa -- dip was mild and not runny, and the chips were fresh and crispy! For dessert we all shared in the churros con chocolate -- churros were, not too hot, but warn enough to start eating immediately, freshly prepared with cinnamon and spices.  The chocolate was supposed to be spiced we didn't taste it. For drinks, I had the Blood Orange margarita (Tequila + Triple Sec + House Blood Orange Sour + Hibiscus Syrup) and really loved it.  Wasn't overpowering but very smooth!  I could've drunk several of those throughout the night!   Definitely recommend this place and would visit here again in a heartbeat!",

My husband and I wanted to find a fun place to have dinner with visiting family and we decided to come take a Joyride, despite the longish wait (45 minutes). We were all impressed with the outdoor waiting area because it is large and comfortable with great blue booths. Our server kept bringing us bowls of chips and salsa, which we happily consumed. Not only did we eat a ton of chips, we ordered a number of beers. Joyride offers beer by the pint and pitcher and we ordered some of both.  When our table was ready, we moved inside and were struck by the trendy interior. Low light emanating from the mid-century inspired light fixtures cast a warm glow over all the hipsters (and non hipsters) in the place. I liked the different color glass bottles in the bar as well as the warm wood tones throughout the restaurant. Our server was friendly and suggested a number of items that we all consumed very happily. Everything tasted fresh: veggies were crunchy, sauces were saucy, nothing was over or underdone. I really enjoyed the crispy fish tacos and Mexican slaw, both of which had great flavor and were gone too soon.   Great place to hang out and enjoy some delicious food. Go take a Joyride soon! I know I will.",

Luckily another waitress swung by and took good care of us .    First bowl of Chips and salsa are complimentary but we also ordered the guacamole.  Guac was yummy - topped with jalapenos so beware .    Tacos are ala Cart grabbed a few of each carne Asada was my   Joyride Marg was ok I tend to like my margs a bit sweeter.   Deff will be back to try some of there other dishes",

    "text": "To start off it was an hour and 30 minute wait. Many people were being seated before us which was a bit weird.. and an hour and 30 minutes was a really long time.. We became the only ones waiting while there were many tables open. After the host left and a new one came we got a text right away that our table was ready? Hmm. We were sat and the place was almost empty. I ordered 4 tacos- The standard -4/5 The best out of the bunch. Carne Asada- 3/5 it was good but so much fat on it.. 2 Pork Adobada- 1/5 had a really nasty after taste.. Chips and salsa- 5/5 too bad the second round is $2 bit much for chips and salsa..  The food took a ridiculous amount of time, again another hour and 15 minutes for our food on top of already waiting an hour and 30minutes. We ordered quickly too, being that we waited so long we had already looked at the menu and ordered our drinks the same time as our food. The waitress said she took our drinks off for the wait, which is kinda funny because we ordered water.. that makes sense? Not. Thanks for taking off our drinks that werent even on the tab to being with..  I know much better and cheaper taco places than this. Not only that but i wasnt even full after leaving. I ended up eating at home, and to be honest i wont be back. Looks cool and everything but i would recommend not wasting your money, and trust me you will be wasting a lot of it here.",

We decided to order 3 tacos -- carnitas and crispy fish ( my favorites, strongly recommend) and the braised beef ( it was ok, felt oily). You get to pick a side for $1 each but we opted to pick the Mexican street corn as our side and it is amazing!!! That's my favorite thing they have on the menu.   For drinks I love love love the pineapple mojito. It tastes so good and refreshing, although I feel like there's really not enough alcohol in it. We also tried the margaritas and those definitely kicked my butt. We tried prickly pear ( felt a little sweet ) and cucumber Serrano -- very good!  I love the atmosphere in here, very laid back. I like the decorations, just everything about it makes me feel like I'm in Cali.",

Super cute place with a great atmosphere; definitely a retro vibe, which is different and unique.   A friend and I ended up sitting at the bar for a quick bite. It's $2/taco during happy hour and $5 margaritas -- a deal I couldn't pass up -- so I ordered a Cucumber Serrano margarita... extremely refreshing, light, and yummy! While we waited for the tacos, we were given complimentary chips and salsa (careful, that salsa has a kick!), which were decent.   For the tacos, I ordered \"The Standard\" (slow roasted chicken, avocado, Mexican slaw and aji amarillo) and \"Chicken Tinga\" (avocado, cabbage, cilantro and white magic). The Standard taco was, well, pretty standard; it was bland, basic, and a bit dry... I can't say I'd order it again. The Chicken Tinga was definitely better and more flavorful and I guess the white magic made it more magical than the Standard taco; it was decent.     Overall, it was a good experience, although quite honestly, I don't know if I'd go here again; for all the hype, I was a bit disappointed with the tacos. I was expecting a little more pizazz, unique flavor, and authenticity in the tacos. Maybe I've been \"taco ruined\" with real authentic tacos in Mexico, but you'd think that with Phoenix having so many great taco places around the valley, Joyride would set the bar a little higher and stand out with their tacos. If I were to return to Joyride, the reason would probably be the Cucumber Serrano margarita.",

They were DELICIOUS! Our server was Carn and she was the best, so patient and so nice. I will definitely return, no doubt. Especially for Taco Tuesday. The environment is great, it's a little noisy, but not too bad at all and they were playing the best music. If you haven't been yet, go! They're right next to Postinos and Federal Pizza, which I will be trying next!!",

Oh, and parking here was surprisingly easy in their lot (no need to go to the overflow across the street).  However, I will never go back here as the music was turned up to a deafening level and was blasting some type of screaming-as-lyrics type noise \"music\" that was painful.  The restaurant was also packed, so people were yelling OVER the yelling \"music\" which made me want to just leave, which I would have if I wasn't with my mother (who thankfully is getting a little hard of hearing and so was saved from some of the horrendous experience).  I feel a weekend lunch is supposed to be a relaxing affair, and not feel like a night club!  If this was management-approved music, and not some employee's iPod plugged in to the sound system, I disagree with their \"mood/environment\" choice and will just have to stick with Federal Pizza next door.",

I call restaurants in advance now, especially on the weekends, to make a reservation or see if they are on a wait. I have called 3-4 different times and they were on a wait anywhere from 30-60 mins each time so we opted out.   Lame Lame Lame. I'm so glad that you're a trendy up and comer place to eat but if you have this sort of service and already seem to be doing just fine without us then so be it.   Wish I could trade the $25 Gift Certificate in for Cash as it seems to be an empty gesture.   We'll continue to support restaurants and places that deserve our business.",

My favorite surprisingly was the chicken tinga--the chicken was super tender and I loved the toppings. The tacos are a bit on the smaller side--my guy friends had to order 5 or 6.  The only thing I disliked was the guacamole--DO NOT GET IT. What a ripoff. $8 for a tiny tiny bowl :(   Otherwise, a great place for tacos! Also the atmosphere is super funky and fun.",

We ordered multiple appetizers, dessert, and multiple rounds of drinks. Our first round took 10 minutes and once the server saw us looking around she told us the bartender was short handed so drinks would be out soon. During our visit we had 4 different servers, one of them told us their name, and the others proceeded to help when they could. Once we received our tabs they were out of order and not correct.   -I asked the server why we were continuing to get different people, she said we came at an awkward time so everyone will be taking care of us. I am not sure if that was an appropriate answer.  -There was no visible manager on staff checking on tables. -The server laid our checks down before we were even done, one of the girls said are you trying to make us leave? The server replied with no I'm just giving you your checks, sorry. (When do you drop checks if we still have half of a beer?)   I do not plan on coming back any time soon due to the poor customer service and unfriendly staff. But thank you for good quality food and a great menu. Also, maybe consider getting beer that is allergy friendly.",

    "text": "Rushed over here yesterday on a Taco Tuesday because I thought the Happy Hour was only until 5 (it wasn't, it's until 6) but since it was Taco Tuesday the specials run all night! Happily we ordered, and I sunk into the awesome colorful, retro decor, complete with vinyl seating and large golden orbs for lighting. I definitely enjoyed the atmosphere and the clientele was mostly young professionals and friends looking to unwind after work. Now, take note, the Happy Hour menu drives a crazy bargain AND is delectable: $2 tacos, $5 margaritas, and $5 pitcher of beers. Pitchers people! We ordered the Carnitas, the Fish, the Standard, and the Pork tacos. Unashamedly, we ordered about 10 tacos between us because they were so delicious and addictive. The tacos weren't too small, but they weren't super large either, and my personal favorite was the Fish (crispy not soggy like some other places), and the Standard (flowing with awesome sauce with every bite). My husband's favorites were the opposite, the Carnitas and the Pork, so we were both very satisfied. The drinks were delicious, too. The Pineapple Mojito was divine - it tasted like they put cane sugar in the drink, and I have no idea if they actually did, but the fact that they could make it taste that way was impressive. The Blood Orange margarita was also tasty, and on the large side, but I enjoyed the Pineapple Mojito better.  Our total bill came out to around $35, which is why I am so glad we moved up the street and will be returning on Taco Tuesday!",

    "text": "HAPPY TACO TUESDAY TO ME!!!  I've been in search for a good taco Tuesday for quite some time. I had tried a lot of taco places all over the valley-- and I always end up with one of those Mexican chain like filibertos/robertos for the authentic flavoring. Coming from Southern California where every corner there's Mexican food-- definitely there's no shortage for authentic  flavoring. Since I moved here, I had realized and learn that the most authentic comes from those Mexican chain restaurant. If it didn't come from there- I've learn to accept my faith if I eat elsewhere- it will be Tex mex flair. Anyhow, I woke up this morning with a strong craving for tacos and a good margarita. Should I go pick up my tacos at my old faithful authentic place? or go to my usual wannabe flair like salty senorita or  blanco taco y tequila?... Hmmm, then I turn to Yelp, on a mission to find a new place and I stumble across this place (joyride). The reviews sounded great and its happen to have a great taco Tuesday menu. Without hesitation, I waited in agony till 2pm for the taco Tuesday deals to start. I arrive to the restaurant and was please by the atmosphere. I seated outside and today weather was a tad breezy but it was great. I already had in mind what I wanted to try on their menu and I have to say ... this is my new taco Tuesday place. I find the margarita are great in flavoring. They did not skimp on the tequila and it is $5. I ordered 3 different kind of tacos but there are like 7 different kind to choose from. Their taco was definitely decent size for $2.. it's not small like street taco size. I love all my tacos but I like the crispy fish taco the most. There are other taco choices in the main menu but not on taco Tuesday menu that sounded awesome. I can't wait to be back to give it a shot next time. It's definitely cheaper than blanco taco y tequila happy hour.. and better than salty senorita-- which their food hasn't been up to par lately. I attached pic but I don't think it did any justice. Go check it out for yourself.",

It can get crowded, so if you have a larger group, I suggest showing up before noon.  They have a great lunch special that offers a small salad and two tacos of your choice for $10 (or is it $9?).  I've gotten that each time I've visited and have not been disappointed!  What's good/dangerous about this place is that they also serve delicious chips and salsa while you wait for your food.  Fortunately, I have a decent amount of self control, so I don't go crazy on the chips and salsa -- but the salsa really is great!  The decor is eclectic, colorful, funky, definitely a very joyful feel when you walk in!  They have a small parking lot, but if you come at peak lunch time it might be full.",

Avoid the ceviche, nothing more than shrimp, a little cilantro and jalapeno.  No marinade sauce, very dry. The two types of fish tacos were ok,  they were not bad but they also did not stand out.  The fish wasn't extremely moist, nor was it dry.  I would call it unspectacular. The most egregious was the $1.00 charge for a small ramekin of salsa.  Whats next, charging for ketchup, salt and pepper. $10 margarita... Again, not great with booze volume despite previous review. Simply too many other places that offer better value as well as better quality of food.  If you're a 25 something, this may be a hip enough place to plop on aFriday.  Other than that, search elsewhere.",

They certainly aren't earth-shattering, but what is is their service.  The value they place upon their customer service is really beyond anything else and what keeps me wanting to come back. Their servers and management are friendly and take the time to talk to you in a very genuine way, not in the creepy Dutch Brothers I have to fulfill my relatability and person next door persona quota, but in a natural way.  I came here for my birthday with my husband and they made it special. They even included a delicious dessert of my choice and while this may or may not be what they do on the regular, the way they did it made all the difference. I will definitely be back and recommend to all my friends (all 2 of them).",

The staff were very friendly, even when we were standing around one of the many entrances not sure where the hostess stand was. No joke, there are like 4 ways you can enter from the outside.   I ordered a house margarita (not a fan) and the chilaquiles. The dish was very good....definitely a fan! The chips, guac, and salsa were good. Since I did not like my margarita, I switched with my husband who had the blood orange rita. Way better.   The food took a really long time to come but it was a nice surprise when the manager or owner came to the table to apologize without any mention from us. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place and everything that came with it!",

    "text": "Visiting from Austin, TX!  Wanted to check this place out last Xmas but they hadn't opened yet.  You had to know this was my first stop in town once the hangover from the drive was gone.  Went with my boy Bry and little one E!  LOVED that they were kid friendly and offered a menu and the bonus upon delivery of his meal.  A temporary tattoo was a fabulous bonus!  Bry and I had 3 tacos each.    Loved the build out!  Upward does a great job paying attention to detail and branding.  That's no secret.  Loved their standard margarita (we had two each).  The Pork taco was great!  Service was awesome as EVERYONE in the building was attentive to our needs!  HUGE plus in my book being a restaurant owner.  Chips and Salsa - okay.  Fish Taco - flavorless.  Other tacos were okay.  This place gets high marks for service and overall concept.  You always want to feel transported when you dine out.  I was truly happy with the destination I landed in.  Its one ride I would take again and again!  Keep it up Joyride and cannot wait to visit you again later in the week!",

The rest of the food was just blah and mediocre. I'm used to some really good authentic mexican tacos, and the taco's here just didn't cut it. They came out rather cold and just eh. It did not satisfy my mexican food craving at all. The rice was kind of cold and crunchy as well. And the elote corn was nothing compared to Barrio Queen. Normally when I leave a restaurant, I'm so full that I tell myself I'll never eat again lol well unfortunately I left here the other night and went straight home to eat something. I was looking forward to eating here because I'm a fan of all their other restaurants that they own in the area; I suppose I will stick to those instead.",

I've been to places where they have 1 dollar tacos and taste 10x better. Therefore I would not recommend taco Tuesday here. I'd go for the margaritas though, and maybe try something different",

The menu said they came with \"White Magic\" which I assumed was a sauce but detected no sauce or magic for that matter. They were good but definitely not great. Fairly bland, barely warm and nothing new here.   Again, service was great and prices are decent. I am digging the vintage, mid century decor and music.

Once at our table we ordered our food and drinks. When it came time for our bills.  None of our tabs rang up as happy hour taco Tuesday. The server came back at least 4 different times with the prices still not adjusted. He blamed split tabs as the issue. After several attempts to correct it he kept giving us the wrong tabs. We asked for a manager several times to assist him but they failed to come speak us. He kept playing the blame game and never even fixed it. Our party gave up, and paid random tabs just to get the out of there. Unfortunately this is not the first time we have had issues and and we have decided the taco Tuesday prices aren't worth all this and that will be our last time. I guess you get what you pay for.",

The restraunt was very busy so we decided to take a seat at the bar, which was open seating.  The music was retro and upbeat, just overall a great atmosphere.  We had the cheese y MAS -- very good, with just the right amount of heat. We also ordered the street tacos -- pork adobada, braised beef, chicken, and pork carnitas. All four were delicious although I liked the braised beef the best and the Salsa and the Guacamole  were wonderful.  I had the prickly pear margarita, which was very light and refreshing.   Great service and atmosphere,  reasonable prices, and food, it is definitely worth a try.",

Inside and outside seating with a dog friendly patio. My go-to taco is the Standard. The veggie taco is also pretty legit. Any of the margaritas won't disappoint. If you have to be extra like me, make the margarita a High Roller for added fun. While waiting take a look around at the decor, there are some clever fixtures made from bicycle parts!",

    "text": "What a neat place! My S/O and I stopped in for happy hour after a long moving day. I ordered a prickly pear margarita and we each ordered three tacos and shared the food. Notable favorites were the carne asada and the pork adobado. Ordered a side of black beans with cotija and we were good to go!  I really like the interior design and overall feel. Neat furniture and decor really makes a place stand out to me. I was also impressed with the huge outdoor seating- it's a space the surrounds three sides of the building!  The only reason why I can't give 5 stars is because of the service. We came in at a time of day where the restaurant was not busy. Tons of empty tables, yet I didn't feel like our service was prompt and attentive. I felt that our waiter was rather standoffish and rushed through his time with us. He didn't smile once, and was not welcoming. I was not impressed, and hope for better service next time.",

    "text": "I'm a frequent visitor to Joy Ride and have never had an issue but last night turned me off a bit. I ordered the standard, carne asada, and crispy fish tacos.   Started with the carne asada, next It was to my shock I found a 3\" long thin piece of plastic in my standard taco after taking 2 bites into it. I immediately shared with my server. She took the plate, asked if I wanted it remade or if I wanted to eat the crispy fish. I shared I was not hungry anymore and done.  After a short time the manger came by apologizing about the situation and said she will take off the crispy fish and standard from my bill.... Excuse me shouldn't my entire bill minus my drinks be taken off? I was willing to pay for the drinks. I was taken back that you're still making me pay for the 1 taco I ate. This seems minute but it's the principle of the entire situation.  In no way is this on my server l, she was amazing and very tentative. This is a reflection of management and how they handled the situation.  It's going to be a while before I return and Joy Ride. I'm disappointed none the less.",

So I've had a burrito (Chimi'd) and tacos and some of the apps and some of the margs...for real you can't make a bad choice here people....but if you like cheese...ADD the fundido!!!!  It's worth the extra $4...not kidding...give me ALL the Fundido!!   Tacos are the usual size and delicious, depending on my hungry level 2-3 is perfect for me and the burritos = 3 meals for me which is great during the week and makes my life a lot easier when it comes to meal prepping my lunches :)  It does get busy so just a heads up there, but it's totally worth it.    Now I think I need an encore....soon...maybe even today...  // cheers //",

The wait was long, but it did go by pretty fast. Probably because the service was speedy and how long could it take to whip up a few tacos?! I appreciated this, along with their awesome staff.   I ordered 3 tacos off of the Taco Tuesday menu. Each delicious in their own way, but my fav had to be the \"Chicken Tinga\" taco. The \"Standard\" and \"Carne Asada\" were both good too! But that white magic they put on the Chicken Tinga was as good as they made it sound. Can't wait to come back soon for another Taco Tuesday, or Happy Hour!",

We didn't get our drinks for 20 mins. It was 5 pm and only one server. He even mentioned it was his 2nd day. Poor guy. Then we asked for chips 3 times. Finally came out super stale. We wanted happy hour (hence being there at 5) but by the time he actually got our order it was almost over. He did honor the happy hour though. The previous time our food came out cold. Maybe it was shift change but this is a bummer. We usually love taking people here but I'm embarrassed now. Hopefully they get the kinks worked out.",

Most of the tacos were 2 dollars and Margaritas were 5 dollars to close. Tired several different tacos which were all great would have given them a 5 but the corn dish off cob was just too salty for Us. I am really on the fence about the not giving the 5 star because our server was over the moon in service and even gave us her favorite dessert on the House because it was our first time. Because of her Catlin H our server, we will be back with friends and family. We will have to sit in your area again thanks so much for making our Tuesday night date night for my wife and I so wonderful. All the other staff we had contact with were so happy and just made the place a fun place to be. Excellent choices and looked like great out door seating to include an out door fireplace.

    "text": "Upward Projects is AMAZING. Postino is my favorite restaurant, with Federal being a close 2nd and Windsor in 3rd place. Churn is heavenly also. I will wait in that 25 minute line with no frustration, and I have introduced and created literally over 50 new Postino and Federal addicts. Because I absolutely LOVE everything Upward Projects touches, one can only imagine how, as a Hispanic who has eaten authentic Mexican food my whole life, would be beyond excited to see Upward Projects open a taco restaurant. A new age one too?!! I'm in!  .....that was how I felt before I actually tried this restaurant. After a long day of wedding dress shopping, I sacrificed eating at Postino to try this taco restaurant that I couldn't wait to rant and rave about, like I have done in the past with everything else that is UP related. I ordered three tacos, rice and beans, my friend ordered enchiladas, rice and beans, and my other friend ordered tinga with rice and beans. I can't tell you how terrible everything tasted. We didn't even finish half of our plates and didn't take the leftovers home.  Everything looked delicious, but the taste did not match up to the presentation. I was so, so, so dang disappointed. :-(   The salsa was semi-decent. That is the best I can say/do.",

    "text": "Hubby and I came here for dinner for the first time tonight. We ordered the guacamole and cheese y mashed for appetizers. They were delicious and left us excited for dinner. My husband ordered the carne asada, carnitas and pork adovada tacos and a side of Mexican slaw. He said that the tacos were traditional and ok but not fantastic. I also felt relatively underwhelmed by my fish and shrimp taco. There didn't seem to be any seasoning on the shrimp and the fish was overcooked and chewy. Also no real sauce, so aside from the tomatoes and dash of guac there wasn't much to them. I also ordered an appetizer of the street corn, which they asked if I preferred on or off the cob. I ordered it off bbn of the cob and what seemed like a tiny portion of cut corn was served in a huge soup bowl. While I understand that the order was most likely one cob of corn, it might be better to serve it in a smaller bowl, so it doesn't look so disappointing. The street corn was ok,  but nothing spectacular. Then  lastly, we ordered the better than Betty's brownie sundae to go. I warmed it just a bit when I got home and ate it with the ice cream that came with it. The ice cream was described by the server as a dulce de leche ice cream, but I'm pretty sure it was just vanilla bean. I'm not sure what Betty they know here that makes bad brownies, but I've met lots of Bettys and I'm pretty sure they all make better brownies. Gave it three stars because it wasn't awful, it just wasn't anything special and not sure we'll go back, since nothing really stood out.",

The place seemed to be very understaffed as the bartender was running all over the restaurant. So, it took awhile to actually order our food.   Our food was just okay. It wasn't anything that I would seek out again. The best part of my meal would be the shrimp taco. When we finished out meal we waited a good 30 minutes before I was able to flag someone down to get our check. I was a little surprised to get charged an extra $4 for a refill on chips and salsa (my friend had asked for a hotter salsa and more chips). I guess I've never been charged at a Mexican restaurant for chips and salsa.  It sounds like from the other reviews that Tuesdays may be worth stopping in, otherwise there are to many great Mexican restaurants in town to bother.",

Im very picky when it comes to Mexican because a lot of people fall short when trying to put a spin on what in my opinion doesn't need fixing. The environment was nice and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  I would come back more for the attention the staff gives rather than the food. Don't get me wrong, food is good just not the ALL THAT it's made out to be. Some people like the Gringo version of Mexican food. I on the other hand I like traditional. Give them a shot.",

    "text": "I was one of the lucky attendees at the Devour event this past weekend (which was awesome) and had this awesome taco. That's how it all started. A simple fish taco that blew me away. I visited the original Joyride Taco Shop out in Gilbert several months ago when they first opened but it fell off my radar. How silly of me.   So one taco was not enough and I found myself up the street after Devour closed up shop and I definitely was not disappointed! What an incredibly beautiful restaurant! Chowed down on the Chilaquiles - enjoyed some cucumber mint aqua frescas (with vodka - so cool that they offer it with your choice of spirit), ate way too many chips, and shuffled into a cab that the staff was more than happy to call for me. The service was stellar, the food was amazing, and the ambiance after the weekend rain was incredible. (I still can't believe that I ate an entire meal after Devour - my waistline definitely does not thank me. Ahh gluttony . . . .)",

On the menu it's called \"Mexican Street Corn\" which it pretty much is. Back home we say elotes...  We also ordered their \"Churros Con Chocolate\" which was so tasty! Great amount of hand-sized churros and a chocolate dip, what more can you ask for?   Their beer selection was great and for you cocktail lovers, their Aguas Frescas are amazing. I only tried my friend's (I'm a beer girl) and you have an option of \"no booze\" or \"con booze\". Definitely get with booze for a good time!  I only gave them four stars because of the service. They got slammed with a large group of bicyclists and rarely checked in on us. It took about 10 minutes for a drink order after being sat and 15+ minutes just to get a food order in.   Sit outside. Take in the outdoors and enjoy the scenery of it all.   P.S. Did I mention they have adobada tacos? I haven't seen that on a menu unless I was in San Diego. Definitely trying that next time!",

That was kind of a bummer because she was talking about it before we got there.  We got the lunch special,  2 tacos and choice of soup or salad.

    "text": "So I previously posted a excellent review, but I will have to rescind that review for my dinner experience. We had a less than enthusiastic waitress who was rude. This was clear as she sighed after every request and made it seem like it every request was super inconvenient.  We weren't impressed by the salsa so we asked if they had other salsas. She brings out three and never mentions that she is charging us two dollars for every small bowl of salsa. We didn't like any of these any better than the first (but were charged $6 for the three salsas).  Because I had had such a good experience before, I was hoping my friend would be equally impressed and love the food.  We ordered the Bandito thinking that would be plenty of food for us to share. It was and it was delicious, but we were disappointed that we were charged $2 for every plate of four small corn tortillas when it's clearly evident that four is not enough. (Also not told about this charge). For desert, I decided to spurge and get the churros. Churros were average, but you'll want to skip the chocolate and Carmel sauce ( which has no resemblence  of a sweet taste and tastes a bit what I would imagine battery acid to taste like).  I was shocked at the bill and decided to pay it and leave. We were not told about multiple additional charges on my bill. I was not in the mood to argue, but my friend was and the manager did a good job of attempting to make it right.    Joyride has great food. Still bad services overrides any desire any desire to come back to this restaurant and I will not be back.",

    "text": "By far the worst dining experience- I will not be back.   First heard about this restaurant shortly after then opened thru coworkers who went for a work related dinner.  They had said both times they went the had terrible service.  I just assumed it was due to the large party and still wanted to try joyride as it had nice reviews and is always crowded.  Me and my boyfriend went on a Sunday night right at the dinner time rush.  We were greeted by the host who used her cell phone to check us in.  That was quick and efficient.  We were told it was a 20 min wait and were pleasantly surprised that we were taken to our table in about 10 mins instead.  When we sat down we were given water and then waited about 15 mins for our waiter who looked tired and worn out.  We ordered our drinks which took another 10 mins to come out (Diet Coke and iced tea) brought by another server.  We were rarely catered to by our server but rather many different people walking by.  We finally flagged down our server to order our tacos.  The quality of the tacos to be honest was subpar.  The food is much better at otro cafe or taco guild.  Ordered carne Asada and chicken Tinga.  The chicken Tinga had a piece of gristle in it and I had to spit it out.  Bland under flavored and over priced.  Next we had just finished when a third server came to clear our plates taking my dates napkin and fork and we told him we would order dessert.  Oh and prior to this we had to ask several times to get refills on our drinks and they kept forgetting my dates iced tea.  No apologies.  As the third waiter kept clearing he threw the fork and knocked it on my dates cell phone.  Once again no apology.  We ordered dessert and sat for 30 mins.  No new silverware was brought.  My date finally had to stand up and grab his own.  Apparently our dessert was forgotten about and again no apology.  We sat there after asking 3 times to get another iced tea (which never came) for we timed it 30 mins for our dessert we would of left.  No offer to comp the dessert no apology again.  Worst service ever.  I finally agreed with my coworkers.  Will not be back.",

The bartender was supper awesome sorry forgot his name but very helpful and recommended some nice drinks with our meal.  The drinks were on point and the tacos were bomb!  I must say tho they keep throwing the warm chips at salsa at me and I would have been full of of those!! Great spot! Great atmosphere 3 thumbs up if I had a third hand :)",

    "text": "Went to Joyride hoping for a casual taco and a good marg. The restaurant was packed and super noisey. The food was very mediocre. I ordered the beast burritto which sounded tasty on the menu- carne asada, beans, avacado, and two types of salsa.  What they delivered to my table was not so appealing. It was a burrito consisting of 99.9% dry, unflavorful meat, hardly any salsa, beans, or avacado. I ordered a margarita which was very ordinary. The biggest reason I am rating the restaurant so low is because of the rediculously loud music blaring in the restaurant. The place was packed and noisey to begin with and then add the crazy loud music and it made the place almost unbearable. The decor and renovation were done very well. Unfortunately the medicore food and horrible atmosphere will keep me from coming back.",

(crispy fish was my favorite) My boyfriend ordered the chicken torta and that was tasty and flavored very well. The pineapple aguas frescas with tequila was definitely a good choice too.

    "text": "I give this place four stars for the happy hour prices.  I'd probably give it 3.5 if I had to pay full price.   Went in on Monday around 4:30. Decently busy, but the three of us were able to get a table immediately outside. Nice patio area with a little bit of shade and well-placed misters.   We all decided to get tacos ($2/piece at HR) and margaritas ($5 @ HR).    We split an appetizer of guacamole which was very, very good. A small portion for $8, but we were saving on the tacos, so we decided to go for it. Definitely try it.    I decided to go with three veggie tacos and a cucumber-serrano margarita.  My boyfriend had the same tacos and my friend had the braised beef, crispy fish, and baja fish (latter two not happy hour tacos, FYI).  I thought my tacos were pretty good, but lacked some depth of flavor.  My friend really enjoyed all three and even compared the crispy fish taco to some tacos she's had in Mexico! Not bad.  Presentation of all the tacos was spot-on.   The margarita I ordered was a perfect sweetness and very refreshing. It came rimmed with chili powder and salt and a hefty slice of cucumber inside with small pieces of serrano. It wasn't spicy at all and I would've liked a little more heat, but it was definitely the best marg. at the table! The other two margaritas my friends ordered were unpleasantly sweet.  Those were the blood orange and the passion fruit margaritas. I'd skip those unless you're into adult fruit juice.   My dinner-mates also got two sides (normally $1 with a purchase of 3 tacos). Even though my boyfriend's tacos were all happy hour options, she still gave him the $1 deal (you're not supposed to do that...She was very friendly). They also got the cucumber orange salad, which was lacking a bit in flavor. There needed to be a better cucumber-to-orange ratio (it was about 95% cukes); the other side ordered was the black beans. Those, on the other hand, were AMAZING.     Staff is all very friendly and fun! Check this place out.",

She could see that I was visibly drained ... which, let's face it, is the real purpose of work, and told me I needed to order Joyride's Mexican corn.  It'd cheer me right up.  Having brought out the beer and the corn, she asked if I was into football (this was right at the time NFL free agency started), and I told her \"no\", but had heard a lot about this Osweiler guy, to which she laughed, and told me it was kind of a big deal, and if sports guys weren't talking about him, they'd be talking about Colin Kaepernick.  She then started making fun of the Patriots in a fake Boston accent that had me laughing for 5 minutes.    For a waif of a girl, she was pretty sports nerdy.  She then asked what I was doing tonight, and I told her probably just zoning out watching tv.  Having heard this, she asked if I was in to Game of Thrones.  I was like, uh, no.  Hayley then broke down the series and sent me home with a free desert telling me to watch it.  I don't think I've ever had that type of service before.  So, if you need a pick me up, stop in here.  They have a pretty great porch too!  Relaxing, and not super douche-y.",

Regardless I'll likely be back...  Let me tell you how to have a good time here all the way around...  Start at the bar and wait to get a booth inside near the bar (especially in winter).  Enjoy the free chips/salsa.  Stick to the standard Taco's - they are pretty good.  Don't have expectations for the sides.  The people at Upward Projects I think have a lot going right at this place.  Winter notice:  The outside patio surrounds the seating with door entries at several points.  This past visit we were seated next to a door to the main patio - it was being opened over and over with the cold winter air coming in.  After the door was propped open a couple times I told them I would let them in when needed (and the parties around us thanked me - they were feeling the cold too).  I think I might rate this a 4 during another season :).",

I guess it's hit or miss with service here because I see a lot of great reviews, but the Sunday evening crew I had yesterday was rough.   The restaurant was half full with the patio being full so it wasn't a packed house. Servers and food runners just seemed impatient and inconvenienced by a request. Also, if I order a handful of different tacos, I expect the food runner to point out what each one is. Hell, for all I know, I may have not received the ones I actually ordered. And don't just drop the food without observing whether we have utensils or not. I get it, you may have a lot going on, but I'm speaking from someone that works in live events and did the service industry gig during grad school - you have to give everyone their due.   I'll certainly be back, though. It's not always like that and the food is always great. Four stars from me.",

The not-so-good: - Weekends and busy evenings may result in spotty service. - Beer and wine menu/selection is not very extensive - but, then again, this is a taco place. - Place tends to be a bit loud - but, then again, this is a super-casual place.",

Service I can forgive but taste I cannot. On the food today: ceviche was bland and lacked flavor. It was almost dry. There was not enough actual juices to consider this a ceviche. Other items we ordered were just too salty! Guacamole, salsas, the standard chicken taco was all too salty. I left feeling like I just visited a salt lick. I don't know what is going on with this place but there needs to be some serious quality control. I don't think I will come to this place again for awhile.   I love the atmosphere, drinks and fun menu but the food is way off par and it's sad. Please make the food the way it was when this place first opened and  I'll be back!",

The hostess let us know it would be about a 30 minute wait, but let us know we could grab a seat on the patio and order drinks and appetizers. (Or grab a seat at the bar - they're first come first serve. But it was pretty full.)   I love the atmosphere here! Very \"Art Deco\" in my opinion.. Funky wallpaper, awesome lighting/glass work around the bar, headlights on the walls that lit up as it got dark! The staff was all very friendly and helpful, and brought candles to all the tables as the sun was setting outside. Not to mention the 3 or 4 extra large doors they had open, giving the whole place a very laid-back vibe.   We opted for a spot on an outside couch, and were welcomed with chips and water. Before we had a chance to order anything, we were getting seated! (10-15 minutes)   Our waitress was a doll, and recommended the blood orange margarita. It was strong (I love a strong drink) and was perfectly sweet. Definitely a winner. The chips were really good, they tasted fresh! The salsa was excellent as well, but too spicy for me to try more than a few times.   I had 'The [Chicken] Enchiladas' and they were tasty! It's too smaller enchiladas that equal the size of what you'd except the size of one to be, served with half red sauce and half green sauce - very cool!  The enchilada itself was delicious, very flavorful and the meat was juicy. The red sauce was my favorite - full of flavor and a little bit of kick. The green sauce fell a little flat for me, I found it somewhat bland - which was a major bummer because green sauce is my jam! I appreciated that it wasn't smothered in cheese, like you usually see in American versions of Mexican food.    I would be a regular if I lived in town. Great food, vibe, service, and prices!",

Then their was an error on our bill so we had to flag down another person (not out waiter because he was no where to be found) then 20mins later he comes back and said \"we fixed it\" and handed me a receipt with another person's credit card! I never handed him a card in the first place! Took another 20mins for them to fix that problem! Hands down one of the worst dining experiences i have had!

There are maybe 2 servers I've had there that have actually been great, I'm sad I can't remember their names to shout them out vs. the rest of the ones that don't even acknowledge you when you say thank you for something.

The table was not wiped down when they came to get us so there was a scramble to get it cleaned off (even though it was \"ready\"), but eventually it was clean and read to eat at.  The chip and salsa seem endless and are slightly addictive. Service can be a bit awkward as its hard to tell the patrons from staff as the staff have no set uniforms.   I ordered the fish street tacos, which were very good, and everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal. The Churros were for desire, not a favorite as they seemed a bit dry and I was not a fan of the dipping sauce. We were not rushed out after dinner and had some time to talk and get caught-up, which was nice.  All-in-all its not a bad place if you like this type of concept.",

Natalie from Upward Projects (the parent company) was amazing from the first time I contacted her. She is incredibly professional and responded to me very quickly. After looking at really expensive quotes for what looked like average food, their quote was the icing on the cake - the cost was so reasonable. No wedding price gouging. Natalie worked with my wedding planner to get all the final details coordinated. Everything was set up so well for the wedding. We had a guacamole/salsa bar for the cocktail hour and a taco buffet for dinner. My guests raved about the food. It was delicious! Natalie and the servers were so incredibly friendly and efficient. I couldn't have asked for more.",

    "text": "I was recently invited to a gathering here which I was thrilled about due to many great experiences at joyride. We sat on the patio near the beautiful fireplace ready to enjoy our fall evening with friends.  I'm loving the music here!  Our server was Trevor and he repeatedly let us down through the evening.  He was super slow to take orders and we had been sitting quite a while before he welcomed us or even took drink orders. When ordering, I inquire if they have Chambord.  He does not know but says he will check- he takes all the drink orders and when everyone gets drinks around us we do not see any for us.  When he runs by a few minutes later I ask \"no Chambord?\" Which he gives me deer in the headlights... I'm like \"just give me the house margarita!!\"  The guy next to me gets his 2nd margarita before I get my first. He does finally explain the bar is backed up- but still takes no ownership or makes any apology.  A simple \"thank you for your patience\" would have made a world of difference.  Just the servers knowing what spirits and liquors they have in stock would be great!!!!!!  The nachos were quite good as well as the chicken, crispy fish, and shrimp tacos.  Unfortunately the rice & beans came out way after the tacos were eaten.   Of course when it comes time to pay trevor tries to give me card to some random guy... Who tries to give a card that says Samantha to a guy?   Trevor is a lackadaisical finger pointer with the memory of a goldfish.  As a business manager I would not have him interacting with clients.",

I strongly recommend the battered fish paired with a delicious cucumber serrano margarita (or 3).  Be sure to arrive early as the wait can be up to 45min/hour but well worth it.  THe staff has always been incredibly friendly and attentive.  Parking is also a bit of a struggle on tuesdays but I'm not sure about any other days of the week.  Patios are inviting and comfortable- in fact, I would prefer sitting at the patio rather than inside.  Will continue to come back to Joyride as a loyal and happy customer!",

When we were seated our server was happy, excited and in a genuinely great mood. Then you could really see how the entire place was all in! The hostess was running food, servers were delivering drinks and managers were clearing tables! And the food, top notch as always. No sacrifice in quality and no eternity wait times.

Management still contacted me offered me gift card to return bc I wasn't fully satisfied w tacos I got.. wow first of all such amazing hospitality. So of course I accepted and went again and this time we had even more fun I love this place bartenders are so cool and knowledgeable and laid back. I ve never been a \"regular\" anywhere bc I like to try different things too much and no place has I guess has drawn my attention enough but I think joyride did it... Im just in a good mood when I'm there everyone's happy staff and guests. I Ordered cucumber margarita that was really good..I love anejo tequilas and Mackenzie suggested a new one I hadn't had b4 that i really liked. I think my first visit it was just some flook or it was my taste buds bc I tried carnitas again on my nachos and were amazing i kinda consider myself a nachos and carnitas expert bc I'm obsessed w both and I order both a lot! In addition got st corn my fiance is Mexican loves corn and a chef and he loved it!! I don't care for corn too much but damn I woke up thinking abt it today is all I need to say I guess and I don't even like corn!! So good on the cob and chz maybe lime on it idk but super good so I definitely definitely recommend this place it's chill fun and good food and service can't ask for anything more :)",

It's cool to see so many people's bikes (think beach cruisers, fixies and Schwinns...not Harleys) outside the restaurant. The restaurant opens almost completely to the outside patios so that the indoor/outdoor feel on a perfect Arizona evening is obviously only going to enhance your experience. The agua fresca I had was delish and we tried a sampling of tacos, appetizers, sides and dessert all of which met or exceeded expectations. The prices are great as well. Of note, the guac is on point, the battered fish taco is tasty tasty and the mandarin and cucumber side salad is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> (who'da thunk?)

    "text": "I had plans to go with a friend to Joyride last night.  Yesterday afternoon, I read a review of Joyride in the Phoenix New Times, and it was less than enthusiastic.  It basically said that the atmosphere was cool, but the food was all pretty bland.  Unfortunately, I have to say that I agree with the reviewer.   I arrived around 6:45 on a Wednesday, and there was a 30 minute wait.  My friend and I sat at the bar, and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  We were seated at a great table that was kind of half inside and half on the patio.  The weather was perfect last night, so I definitely enjoyed that.  We started off with chips and guac.  I read one Yelp review from yesterday that raved about the chips and guac, and, I honestly have no idea why.  The chips were very bland, as was the guac.  I LOVE good chips and guac, so I was disappointed.  I wasn't crazy about the salsa either, which I also thought was bland.  Although the New Times review specifically had talked about the fish taco being soggy and fishy, I tried it anyway b/c my friend had ordered them at the Gilbert location and said they were the best fish tacos ever.  Well, there must be some disconnect between the two locations, because this fish taco was nothing to write home about.  It wasn't soggy, but it was definitely on the fishy side compared to other fried fish tacos I've had, and the white sauce that they put on it was basically flavorless.  I also had a carne asada taco, which our waitress said was her favorite.  It was pretty good, but nothing special...definitely better than the fish, though.  Finally, I had a side of the street corn.  I am very picky when it comes to Mexican street corn, and this wasn't great.  I don't know what it was, but it almost tasted like mayonnaise.  Usually I love the creamy sauce that comes on street corn in restaurants, but I wasn't feeling it at Joyride.  I would really like to give Joyride 2.5 stars, but I can't, so I'm rounding up for great service, cool atmosphere, and for the fact that none of the food was awful.  I don't think I'll go back, though.  Yes, it's a cool atmosphere, but, if I'm going to have to wait half an hour on a Wednesday, I want great food as well.  Plus, it was so crowded that my friend and I almost had to yell at each other.  I ordered pretty much all the same things at Gallo Blanco last month and was blown away, so I think I'll head there instead next time I'm craving tacos and street corn.",

Excellent margs, a nice deviation from your basic margarita, but nothing too bizarre or fancy. Great tacos (check out $2 taco tuesday!), and truly inspired flavor and ingredient combinations. Definitely worth a return visit, and another, and another.",

    "text": "Joyride is a little bit of a mixed bag. When we arrived for happy hour the place was hopping. We were seated outside (without them asking if that was alright first, but it was alright...). When asked if it was still happy hour, the hostess replied 'is it before 5?' a little snarky.... but ok. The service overall was slow and somewhat inattentive, but they were busy so they have an excuse at least. The food and drinks, on the other hand, were very tasty. We ordered drinks, I asked what was better between the horchata with alcohol or the blood orange margarita.....well, they were out of the horchata, so marg it was. The marg was large, tasty, and at only 5$ on happy hour, I was a happy camper. The husband had the pineapple aguas frescas... this was less delicious. It just tasted like pineapple juice and alcohol... not bad, but not wonderful.  The salsa was just subtly spicy and full of flavor. The husband and I shared 3 tacos - fried fish, chicken tinga, and the pork. I would say the best was the fish, very light and crispy, followed by the pork, and then the chicken (which was fine, but was supposed to be spicy and wasn't really). Because we ordered 3 tacos, we got a side. Our server wasn't sure if they were out of rice (early in the afternoon?), but they did have it. It was fine, pretty standard rice, but the green salsa that was served on top was very tasty. The food was very filling and it was affordable, so I will most likely visit again!",

This place is much bigger than the one in Gilbert and from the looks of it much hipper too. The place has somewhat of a 70's discotheque feel to it but without the stale cigarette/alcohol smell. My wife had a strawberry agua fresca which was awesome. They bring chips and a roasted salsa to the table which is awesome. I ordered the chicken fila salad which was amazing. It's kale with jicama and crunchy green beans. Sounds weird but just do it and you won't be disappointed. My wife had the chicken tinga that was very good as well. Make sure you ask them for the green salsa. It really makes your plate. They have a patio outside that looks like it'd be awesome to sit in when the weather is nice. At the end of the day, the service was great which always goes a long way for me.",

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I am sick of places that try to fancy up Mexican food, I usually end up wishing I would have just gone to a taco shop.

We asked for no tomatoes in them, but were informed that the guacamole was pre-made. At that point, I didn't want to order them, but did anyways. The guacamole was bland, flavorless. We received the queso, and it was just okay. It tasted like velveeta. I ordered the two veggie tacos. They were bland. No amount of salt and cholula could help that. The tortillas were good. My girlfriend got the carne asada taco. She said it was pretty good. There was too much cabbage. She also got the fish taco. The fish was good but semi non-existent. I gave it three stars because the drinks and ambience were nice. The service was okay, as well. Food came out rather quickly. I might come back, but I would only sit at the bar and order drinks.",

As a periodic visitor to the Phoenix area, I have both recommended and been a repeat customer to Joyride. As a Southern Californian, I can say the food definitely exceeds any south western America standard for non taco shop Mexican food.  A part of a larger concept created by Upward Projects, Joyride Taco House is an enjoyable experience as well as a great place to eat. If you're not stuffed from eating and drinking it all in at Joyride, just cross the street and go to fellow Upward Projects property Churn for dessert!",

I just don't know if I actually like the tacos...I've never tried them.  Therein lies my only complaint with Joyride (and gourmet taco places in general).  The tacos just never seem like they are worth the price (unless you are here on a Taco Tuesday night or I suppose have self control and don't need 5-6 tacos like me...)  The free chips and salsa are a nice touch and the service is usually outstanding.  Like I said, the food is delicious! I promise I'll try the tacos eventually...",

At times, it seems management is keeping the staffing too thin in order to keep labor costs down.  As a result, the service here is terrible a little too often.  Additionally, the staff is not very friendly unless it is your specific waiter/waitress.  I've read other yelp complaints that the staff ignores people, walks right by them, won't smile.  One has to wonder if this business is building on transactions rather than relationships.  Only relationships will grow their business.",

The service is hit and miss. Most of the time the service is very slow. I'd come more often if the service improved...  Update: I'm downgrading my review to 2 stars because of the service. I've had horrible inattentive service on my last 3 visits. Bartenders, hosts and servers have all gone downhill. Last night our dirty dishes sat at our table for 20 min with nobody coming by to clean them up. The salsa is now $1 for an extra bowl? WTF? I hate being charged for trivial things like this so just add it to you food costs. Its like being charged for water on an airplane. After ordering the salsa I never received it. I never received the guac I ordered. Long wait times at the bar with no acknowledgement. I understand being busy, but acknowledge the customer and tell them it'll be a few minutes before we can serve you.   The food is 3 stars, but if the service doesn't pick up I won't be returning.",

I have since been back MANY times and have had an awesome experience so far. For tacos my faves are the baja fish, crispy fish, but the best is the standard. The chicken burrito is surprising with an amazing blend of flavors and the sidewalk chilaquiles are amazing. Great margaritas, not super strong but only $5 on happy hour. Taco Tuesdays are great for cheap tacos. Joyride uses group service so the wait staff is attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed and fun, I have enjoyed very different experiences from the bar, to the main restaurant, to the patio. A MUST for anyone looking for small bites and great drinks.",

The only tacos not available on the $2 menu are the Baja fish, the shrimp, and the braised beef. Definitely try the crispy fish and the carne asada, although sometimes the carne asada meat is a little chewy. The Ollie salad was just ok. The fresh herbs mixed with the kale salad made it taste a little grassy to me, and the lemon couscous was just alright. The yucca chips were good though. Also, their chips and salsa are great! At dinner time the inside of the restaurant gets very dim, but your eyes adjust I suppose. Be prepared to wait a little if you come on Tuesday!",

The decor and ambiance are stellar;however, Taco Bell does a better job than Joyride at food. The taco shells are all store bought and the food is uninspired at best. Store bought chips which were stale and a mainly raw flour tortilla on my Crispy fish taco. Additionally, the extremely overpriced shrimp \"ceviche\" appeared to use pre-cooked cocktail shrimp.   Give this place a miss.",

Got 3 different tacos all of them were cold when they were served - like they had been sitting waiting to be brought to the table.  Crispy fish - best of the 3, would have been a good taco if it wasn't cold  Chicken tinga - cold, gross tortilla, decent flavor   Carne Asada - awful. Cold, gross tortilla, bland tasting and the steak was poor quality.  The chips and salsa - chips were heated nicely and salsa was very flavorful.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Overall, Joyride has a great ambience and nice patio with open air feel. Just don't come here to eat!",

    "text": "This was my first visit here and It was a good one.  I started out with the lunch special of two tacos and a soup.  For the tacos I had a crispy fish and a carne asada.  I added the tortilla soup as well.    The carne asada was pretty decent.  I've definitely had better.  It was a little dry and burnt on some pieces but good flavor and just enough spice with the salsa they add.    The crispy fish however was really good.  Great crisp on the breading and the sauces they add give it a great overall taste.  I would for sure get multiples of these again in the future.    Now as for the soup I had it was lacking in a lot of areas.  It came out just slightly over warm temperature which was my first turn off.  I also had next to no chicken in it with mostly broth and a lot of veggies.  Missing something as far seasoning but I couldn't pin point what it was.  I just know I've bad much better at other Mexican restaurants.    All in all a good lunch experience and I will be back to try some other items.",

And I'm like, oh.  LoL okay. Chips and salsa are my favorite food so that was nice. The guy who took my order....I saw the face you made as you walked away.  -_-  Nachos: Asked chicken or carnitas, he suggested half and half.  Okay. Chicken was delicious, dug out the carnitas after two bites, didn't care for it. Suggestion, don't add the meat, doesn't need it.   Mexican Corn: Do It!!!!  Mo's dessert: Saved for later and was okay. Mayhap better eaten right away...  FYI, to go order I got chips and salsa. If I had known that, I wouldn't have ordered the nachos. Ate these the next day, chips started to go stale but the salsa was better cold. I'm not a fan of the dark red salsa. But yum!!  Side note : the chips and salsa young lady was super nice while I waited. We bonded over yoga, recommended the Bikram Yoga Phoenix down the street. Welcome to Phoenix Alaska girl. :)",

We were a party of 7 and had a short 10 minute wait, eventually getting a table on the patio facing Central Ave right in front of the fireplace! They cranked up the heaters, not knowing half the party was in town from Chicago and quickly turned them down at our request. The blood orange margarita was excellent, not too sweet but smooth. We had the cheese y mas (a chunky queso dip) which was awesome, along with ceviche (very good, light and not too acidic) and the guacamole (alright, but not in my top 5). The chicken enchiladas were very good with red and green sauce, spicier than I expected. The staff was attentive but not overbearing kept waters full and cocktails coming. I'd definitely pay this place another visit.",

    "text": "I go to Happy Hour with my coworkers here and it's okay.  The drinks are GREAT. Try the pineapple mojito - they'll ruin you for anything else.  The problem for me comes with the food.  I'm GLUTEN-FREE due to a diagnosed wheat allergy, and there are VERY few things I can eat here.  The service (and perhaps the kitchen) staff does not understand issues of cross-contamination with food allergens.  My server there the first time went to ask the chef what I could eat (and I said \"severe wheat allergy\" several times) and came back telling me I could eat the chips among a few other things.  I ate ONE chip and my mouth started itching.  I called him back over and asked if they used a shared fryer for wheat/gluten-bearing and wheat/gluten-free products and he came back saying that they did fry the chips in the same oil as the wheat-filled churros  That's allergen cross-contamination 101 and anyone in food service should think/know about it and communicate that to customers.  Had I not known by hard experience to take a tiny bite and go slow no matter what my server said, I would have had to Epi-Pen myself.  On the plus side, I bring my own chips now sometimes and once I explain, they're happy to bring me a bowl of salsa so I can snack with the rest of the group.    If Joyride would simply use a dedicated fryer for its chips, I'd be able to eat a lot more -- including the yummy-looking chips and salsa and their amazing-looking nachos. As is, there are two or three tacos I can supposedly eat.  I stick with the Standard taco because it's never made me sick.  The food is never bad, but it's not really even either - one time I had a fantastic one, full of fresh, sweet corn kernels.  Other times the taco has been okay, with hardly any corn.  Proportions of ingredients change, affecting the taste -- perhaps because of the availability of fresh ingredients?  All in all, I go because I like hanging out with my friends from work and the drinks are truly great.  But I wouldn't choose to go back on my own. Joyride is owned by the same group that owns Postino's, which has some great gluten-free options.  Wish they'd catch up a little.",

That was the first thing that was mentioned.  The booths were big and comfortable with plenty of room.  The music is fun and upbeat.   Now to the food.  The chips and salsa are great and they just keep coming.  We got the nachos which we could have finished with and had a great night.  My mother in law got the vegetarian burrito and said she would love to come back and get some more.  My husband and I got the 3 tacos and they were each very good, not authentic but still good.  My daughter had had the chicken tacos in the past so decided to have the burrito and ate every bite.  If she only kind of likes something she will eat some of it but when she eats the whole thing it means she really likes it.  The orange cucumber sale was a big hit.  The black beans were ok the rice was not so good.  For dessert we had the churros and the banana pudding.  My husband knowing full well that I am allergic explained how delicious the pudding is.  The churros come with a chocolate sauce that has a hint of spice to it.  I have already been there twice and plan on returning.",

They lacked flavor and were not as amazing as people talk them up to be. Not to mention, there was a hair in one of my tacos. After that experience, i didn't think I would go back, but last night I was searching for a place open past 10pm because I was starving! Joyride was open and my friend suggested their veggie bowl. So, I ordered their veggie bowl with added chicken to go, and I thought it was absolutely delicious! But, just an hour or less later, my stomach started cramping up. I woke up in the morning feeling extremely sick and for the rest of the day I was in bed. My stomach has been nauseous and crampy all day. Once again, a terrible experience with the food at joyride. The only reason I'd give Joyride a star is for their service. My server was very nice and took great care of me.",

It took almost 2 hours to get the food, and they didn't sort anything, because \"it takes too long.\" You had 2 hours... plenty of time to sort food. Not to mention... You're making tacos. It's not some delicacy that takes a long time to create. What would have happened if all 8 of us had come to the restaurant to dine in? Would we have been asked to come back tomorrow? Would they not have given each of us our own plate with our orders on it? It's not hard to put together an order for 8 people, I've done it. As a former restaurant manager, I would have had a nice talk with my staff for something like this. They must hate revenue, and not fully grasp the concept that big tickets are good for their bottom line (not that $175 should be considered a big ticket).

The elote corn appetizer was great and the churros dessert was amazing.  But the service was truly what sets this restaurant apart.  Our server was friendly and attentive, and at least 2 of the managers stopped by to check on how our meal was.

The food was amazing and fresh, especially the carne asada taco and shrimp taco. Now we can eat Mexican food 3x a day, and this fresh and zesty menu definitely hit the spot. Reasonable prices as well. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful, and our server knew the menu like the back of his hand. Surprisingly a dying trait among servers.

If you order 3 tacos you get a side free, the tacos range about $3 to $4 so your looking at about $9 to $12 for a taco platter. I ordered two chickens tacos and a fish taco with a side of rice. All were really good. Like their brothers, Winsor & Federal Pizza, if you visit before 6pm for happy hour (everyday) you can get a pitcher of beer (a good selection including local) for $5.

What made me especially happy were the really nice options for vegetarians. This can sometimes be difficult at Mexican restaurants. I asked our server (we sat at the bar) about suggestions, and she said that anything with their signature veggie mix was good. I chose the enchiladas, which also had goat cheese, and they were AWESOME.   The veggie mix was delicious and not boring, the creaminess of the goat cheese, and just the right amount of heat (I selected red sauce) made a killer and satisfying combination. At $9.00 the portions were more than generous, but my companion and I worked together to finish them up.   This will definitely be my new go-to spot for Mexican in this neighborhood. Again, they only lose one star for the parking situation. I'm never keen on forced valet, because I rarely have cash to tip.",

    "text": "OMG! what a great and incredible experience! The Tuesday Tacos were just incredible! i had way more tacos then i thought i would. the Carnitas taco were done to perfection both in spice and in taste all in all was a great combination. The fish taco, was good, and decent, but seemed to be missing something. ( I could not put my finger on what). the Pork adobe was a bit too spicy. I love spicy but not when it deprives me from tasting the rest of the food. and the margarita my oh my.  I am usually a classic margarita chick, but i read so many reviews about The Cucumber/Serrano margarita, that i just had to try it. I am so glad I did! delicious, tasty, spicy and super refreshing. absolutely loved the atmosphere as well. the Patio seating has a nice fire pit  to stay warm, and the whole ambiance is totally local. When you walk in, you get the feeling of being in a locals spot. very friendly from the person seated next to you to the person serving you. This local joint, has my support.",

Yummy chips and salsa. Reasonable prices. Braised beef taco was solid.   Cons:  Taco's came out cold, nothing hot about anyone's entree's.  A touch too loud  Nachos were ok, was expecting more flavor.   I'd be willing to go back on a week night and try this place again!",

I ordered the braised beef and red chili tamales and L.O.V.E.D. them!!! They were so awesome! As were the pinto beans, and I am NOT a pinto bean fan! They had incredible flavor. My husband ordered three different fish tacos, he said the shrimp one was OK, but the other two he loved! He's a picky eater, too! My daughter is the pickiest of eaters, but she loved the chicken out of her taco. I ate the beans and tortilla and thought, even for being super simple, had a ton of delicious flavor.  The service was slow towards the end, miserably slow, but the servers and the hostess were all super friendly and funny. Loved the ambiance, too. We sat outside and it was great! Kiddos loved running on the grass (as no other patrons were out there at the time).   All in all, it was a nice evening with very tasty food! Loved it, thanks Joyride!",

The wait staff was knowledgeable and directed me to a Non Cilantro meal (thank you Jesus).   The ambience is very original. Funky modern we will call it. The music was at a perfect volume. My companion and I were able to have a conversation without screaming and saying what every other word.   The pinto beans are refried. They don't state this on the menu.  Chilaques looks delicious! My companion said it was in every sense of the word.  I had the Carne Asada taco. Very very good.   They serve a really refreshing beverage called a Agua Frescas . Now we're talking!!!   To sum it up delicious  and stuffed!!!!  Thank you good folks at Joyride!!!",

We felt that The Standard Taco was not as good as the Fish Taco, or the Carnitas, but they were all tasty. Kind of on the small, \"street\" taco size, but hey, for the price, it was fair. Sitting outside was heavenly under the big trees overhead and the sail cloth. Very cool looking location, quite a surprise. We'd passed this place many times and never stopped. We'll be back.",

On busy nights, you have to valet or park across the street. Not that big of a deal, but I just can't see valeting my car for tacos... Weekdays aren't as busy. Enjoy!

I also had a cucumber/mint agua fresco with gin, also very good.

Then I had the tacos and my husband ordered the enchiladas.  That is where it went south.  My  tacos were barely warm, and that is not good with fish or shrimp tacos.

We all have different margarita preferences but a few of us were in love with their coconut margarita which has now been removed and replaced by a generic pina colada flavored one. Service here is always a crapshoot depending on the server you end up with. We've had occasions in which the night is nothing but fantastic. Then certain nights are derailed by poor service. Either they screw up our order, downright forget to submit our orders, or serve us our order, only to never come back again for us to order either additional food or drinks. Depending on the server, I even just order two drinks to start because I know afterwards, the odds of me being able to order again is slim to none. The inconsistency of this place is very frustrating. I want to love this place, but as for now we tolerate it, simply because it's the one place we can all agree on food-wise.",

My husband and I came here on Valentines for a date around 8 pm and got right in! The service was great from start to finish--very attentive, friendly folk. They give you free chips and salsa! I ordered 3 tacos: carnitas, carne asada, and crispy fish. I don't know which was the carne asada vs the carnitas.  They were both good, but one of them tasted like char grill - which is cool if you're into that flavor. I loooved the crispy fish taco and would get 3 of those next time instead lol. It had this really good sauce on it and fresh tasting cilantro and cabbage. It wasn't super fish, and I loved the crunch it had. My husband got a burrito that was so massive he took some home as leftovers. He loved it! My favorite part about Joyride, though, is the ambiance. It's sooo cool and retro and there are a lot of eclectic features to look around at! There's a fire place outside so I can imagine the patio scene will be LIT when the weather warms up! I'm totally craving another one of those crispy fish tacos right now and can't wait to go back soon!",

Crispy fish and carne asada tacos are my go to, with a side of joy rice. Have had a couple of the apps and a few different tastes of some of the mains and they have all been very good. I feel like this place is a bargain if you go during the happy hour times. Service this past visit was excellent with the server/food runner realizing a possible food allergy before the food was served.",

The standard & crispy fish tacos were my favorite. The street corn was insanely good & the churros at the end were perfect. The spiked horchata was SO good. Just everything. Since becoming vegan tho this place doesn't have much to offer besides good drinks so that's a bummer. For such a hip place down town I wish they catered to vegan diets.  UPDATE; So very cool update to add! The manager messaged me after seeing my review & told me about their burrito & how to make it vegan. VERY good. So filling, so full of flavors, absolutely delicious & give me a great option for a date night with hubby. These guys rock.",

I ordered grilled fish taco which was pretty dry, veggie taco was ok and so was the shrimp. The standard chicken taco was kinda tastes and dry as well. But that's just my opinion. My cucumber margarita was good. The other margarita that was ordered was not the best and actually the bartender noticed that we didn't like it and he took it off the bill. Very good customer service. Over all I would suggest this place for drinks and atmosphere .  Changing the review from 3 to 4 stars due to the manager reaching out after reading my comments! Definitely deserve an extra star for customer service and striving to be better!!!",

This is a great spot for Mexican food with the family, out with friends, on a date night, and even with your co-workers!! I was treated here by my new co-workers and it was a fun experience. The staff was gracious and eager to help us find seating for such a large group during busy lunch hours.  Another time was with family after a visit at the Heard Museum to see the Frida and Diego exhibit. This gentleman (who worked at Joyride) was walking by our table and was so incredibly kind to ask how our time was at the Heard Museum. We ended up talking about the other museums in Phoenix and Scottsdale. I wish I knew his name because y'all have a great server!!  Note: If you want extra salsa, then you have to pay extra unlike other Mexican food restaurants... Although, the one specific server we had doesn't tell you until after it has been brought to the table... Odd. This was the only staff member my family and I were not pleased with. Once again, wish I knew his name because he really shouldn't be a server. Please give us enough salsa for the amount of chips given. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars.  BUT, nonetheless... Thank you, Joyride! Y'all always show us a good time!",

I thought maybe with the new Yelp! checkin system we could avoid the ridiculous wait. No such luck.  The system told us the wait was about 30-45 minutes and to arrive by 7:03pm. We weren't seated until almost 8:30pm. Each time we spoke with the hostess regarding our place in line she was very pleasant; however, she was never able to provide a realistic wait time. When finally seated the manager provided us with some complimentary guacamole and corn fries, but the experience was already ruined.  As previously mentioned, I anticipated the restaurant being packed on a taco Tuesday (I'm a restaurant manager myself. I know better). However, the early check in system gave me False hope with it's completely off base quote time. No $2 taco is worth a 2 hour wait.",

We sat down and were served water and chips & salsa right away. The salsa is homemade and has a little after-kick, and the chips were warm and fresh. We had the Joyride margarita and the pineapple mojito which were both excellent. For tacos, we tried the carne asada, The Standard, and the grilled fish, and all were excellent!

With their Taco Tuesday special (happy hour from 2pm til closing) and  their weekdays Happy Hour (2-6) you can't beat the great tasting taco prices ($2) and margaritas ($5).  You can also get a pitcher of beer, a glass of wine or spiked Frescas for $5 but rarely do I stray away from their margaritas.    Their staff is always friendly and can manage the crowd well. It's often busy during happy hour so I'd recommend that you arrive during the early part of the happy hour if possible or you'll be waiting for a little if with a decent size group. During the busy hours they do offer valet parking to try and manage the parking situation since it's a smaller lot.   Overall just love me some Joyride!",

Since we've been here several times, we've been able to try a lot off the menu. The burritos are huge and definitely something you can share.   During Happy Hour, some tacos are $2 and the margaritas are $5. It's a great deal! We've tried the pork tacos, the standard, and the crispy fish. All were delicious.   As for drinks, we've tried the Prickly Pear Margarita, the Pineapple Mojito, the Mango Mandarin Margarita, and the Blood Orange Margarita. While all of them were good, my favorite is the Blood Orange Margarita. However, at $5 a pop, you can definitely try a few.  Overall, it's a great place to hang out with friends, go on date night, or just hit up if you're in the mood for tacos. I'd highly recommend checking it out!",

My only negative comment would be it was very wet, upon the eating it kept dripping juice out. The flavors were awesome especially the salsa. I shared a little bit of my partners vegetarian burrito. Whatever they put in it sure tasted good, but they could've grilled out a little bit longer and got the outside tortilla crispier. She had two blood orange margaritas. I had a sip and it was very fruity. We had a friend with us who also ordered a Mexican corn Appetizer. She gave us all of the taste and the corn was very sweet and fresh.   What I especially liked was the way the inside of the restaurant flows to the outside patio when the entire windows open up. There is even a beautiful stone fireplace on the patio for those chillier evenings in the winter. If our guest had been amenable to sitting outside, I would've definitely enjoyed that. I'll save that for another evening with some hot salsa and hopefully a glass of sangria.",

We went around happy hour and sat within 5mins but the wait can be 45mins on other busy nights. The Serrano cucumber Margarita is my favorite! Just the right amount of spice. They do a great job with the tacos. We also got chicken burrito that had butternut squash but little to no chicken but we mentioned it to our server and they made us another one and the manager Jeff came by to check with us which we really appreciate and didn't expect but that just proves the excellent service they offer. I always bring my family here when they visit and will continue to do so!",

The staff has always been friendly and welcoming. Reasoning for the 4 stars is our waitress forgot about the guacamole we ordered.   My recommendation is the Sidewalk Surfer Chilaquiles which is sunny-side up eggs, chicken, corn tortillas, pinto beans, avocado, asadero, queso fresco, salsa verde and fire-roasted salsa. It is the go-to menu item for sure. Cheers!",

The $14.00 Beast Burro is supposed to have Carne Asada (steak) in it.  It did, but not very much and it was all at one end of the Burrito.  The Burrito was mostly flour tortilla and \"filler\".    The chips were bland, not much taste to them.  We have decided to not go here again.  We usually order from Some Burros in Scottsdale.  It's less expensive and tastes much better.   Perhaps the chef from Joyride should go visit some other restaurants and see if he/she likes the food at them.  Blanco is usually much better too.  Neither one is authentic Mexican.  We go to Via Delosantos on Central and Dunlap for the Marilou Quesadilla.   It's the best.",

Hmmm yeah I'll pass also the price point for the restaurant does not cater to valet services kinda annoyed by that. Wait was long we also came on Tuesday where they have $2 tacos and $5 margaritas this is the main event. Staff was awesome could for sure feel some frustration from the valet and hostess it was busy I understand you can't keep a straight face forever. Overall this place is good the food is cheap and tastes nice. Don't come here expecting anything authentic or SPICY everything advertised as spicy is mild at best. Would reccomend would come back can't beat those Tuesday deals.",

    "text": "Imagine that Jonathan Adler decided to make a taco shop in Phoenix, Arizona, and you've got this place. There isn't enough parking for even the lunch crowd, and I got there a little after noon on a Friday. They were already on a wait list for tables, but I was dining solo and easily got a spot at the bar. I loved the geometric turquoise wallpaper and giant gold lamps, but wondered if the tacos would be as excellent as the interior design. I opted for the lunch special and got a glass of lemonade because I was working that afternoon (although looking back, I should have made it a margarita!). The lemonade was fresh squeezed and refreshing, and a cool breeze came through the open restaurant as I waited for my food, which made me feel like I was on vacation... although coming to the southwest from the northeast in February is a vacation even if I had to work the whole time!   The server at the bar - a curly dark haired skater-looking girl with backwards hat, was extremely friendly. I heard her recommend the quinoa salad as a side to the women next to me, and I am so glad I was eavesdropping! I got the salad as well as two tacos - The Standard and a carnitas taco. Everything was ridiculously good with juicy tender meat and slices of avocado on top. I don't think I left a crumb on the plate. It was a perfect, quick, and economic lunch, coming it at just over $10! Plus, chips and salsa come for free. I highly recommend this spot to locals and visitors alike.",

    "text": "Living in the Phoenix area, there are no shortage of Mexican food options.  To stand out, you really have to be doing something interesting.  From an aesthetics standpoint, Upward Projects is definitely bringing the goods by creating a Mexican cantina/taco stand with a hip urban vibe.  As for the food?  Well, that could use some work.  Came here on a lunch date on Saturday.  The place was busy, but not totally full.  We elected to sit out on the patio on a beautiful day.  The service we received was prompt and friendly throughout.  Seeing how this is Joyride Taco House we figured we'd find out if the tacos would indeed stand out.  Each of us got the same three tacos:  The Standard (a chicken and avocado mix), Carne Asada, and Shrimp.  The shrimp was good, the carne asada was adequate (though I've had better), and the standard was kind of disappointing.  The biggest letdown for me were the tortillas.  They were very dry and stale tasting.  Did not taste fresh made at all.  My side of Joy Rice with Salsa was also pretty average.  In terms of ambience and service I was not disappointed.  The building looks great with a cool bar area and a great laid back outdoor patio.  Upward Projects has done a great rehab of this old building.  But I've had much better tacos at nearby neighborhood spots like Tacos Atoyac and Gallo Blanco.  If Joyride's tacos can eventually reach that standard or better, then they'll work out just fine.  For now, the quality has room for improvement.",

The door this was next to seemed more like a back entry but either way, I was still greeted with smiling faces and helpful people.   It wasn't busy so the host gave us a choice of sitting indoors or outdoors. We chose outdoors since it was incredibly nice out. Our server helped us out with drinks right away. We were celebrating so we went with a pitcher of beer to start, but I do love the option or ordering a, \"short one,\" here. It's just a choice a lot of places don't really offer anymore, so kudos for that Joyride!   Moving along, I ordered a crispy fish taco and the Mexican street corn. Both really, really good and super tasty next to our beer choice. I highly recommend at least one crispy fish taco while you're here!   But let's get back to the design of the place. Like all of the uptown restaurants, it's got it's own flavor of trendy design. Be sure to check out the wall next to the bathroom, it's interactive. When I was there, it said, \"In this life, I will...\" and guests can contribute whatever they want to the wall. Oh, and it you're chewing gum, make sure to use one of their cute little gum things (in the sugar caddy) to dispose of it before you eat. They are so cute!   My only regret is that we got here a little before Happy Hour and had not realized it until after we ordered, but that's our bad. I'll be back for it! Really amazing place!

I did enjoy joyrides food and drinks but the service is downright awful. I have come all times of the day so I know it's not just during their busy times. Waited close to 45 minutes just to place an order. Wanted some more chips and salsa because at this point we've been waiting so long to place the order we're pretty famished, they tell us that'll be an additional two dollars; okay fine whatever, although I find it a little ridiculous that six people dining together get one bowl of chips and salsa to share and then they want to charge $2 for more. Well they never came anyways. Food finally comes and they never check in, refill drinks, etc. this has not been a one time thing, this seems to be the experience every.single.time despite if they're busy or not. I'm done going here and won't ever be back.",

    "text": "Really disappointing. I had high hopes for this place because from what I understand, the same people who own the Federal and Windsor also own Joyride. It was just the exact opposite of those places. The food was bland and overpriced. There are other places who are making these same tacos, but doing it much better. I would compare it to eating tacos at the airport. They were ok, a little more pricey then they should be, and forgettable. 2 stars because they still do the $5 pitcher before 5 deal everyday. But if that's all you're in it for, go next door to the Federal or Windsor and the experience will be much better.",

We're vegan, so my husband politely asked about what we could eat on the menu. Our waiter said only the rice and cucumber salad. That didn't seem right, because they seemed to have a few vegetarian tacos/apps that could be made vegan (aka, no cheese or sauce). So, we asked again and got an extremely agitated and rude response. We don't expect to be able to eat everywhere, and would not have chosen this place personally. However, we were there for a party and were just curious.  So, the rest of the night the waiter would continue to ask the rest of our party (about 12 other people) what they wanted, but would never stop next to us. Not even for drinks. We weren't rude, and were just curious about a new place. We ended up sticking with the tomatillo rice and fire roasted salsa....which were pretty decent. The chips are great! Sadly, with the customer service we experienced, we will not be returning.",

    "text": "I'm so thankful Upward Projects - the restaurant-building brand that brought the Valley favorites such as Postino, Windsor and Federal Pizza - finally opened a Mexican food joint with their Gilbert spot Joyride Taco House. The Central Phoenix version debuted last month, and I went there this weekend to sit on the colorful expansive patio in this gorgeous Valley weather.  The decor and menu at Phoenix's Joyride is the same as the Gilbert location. I love Joyride's chips and salsa. The salsa is the perfect level of spiciness, while the chips are thin. They're the perfect way to start your meal.  At both locations, I ordered the Veggie and Goat Cheese Enchiladas ($9) - they were just so darn good the first time! They come smothered in both red ancho chile and salsa verde sauce and are bursting with that delicious goat cheese.  It's a really massive entree, but I still ordered a side of rice ($3) and black beans ($3) - am I the only one who thinks rice and beans need to complement every Mexican meal?  That is actually probably the one thing I would change here: make the entree portions smaller (for example, one enchilada was plenty for me), and add rice and beans to meals. As it is now, I received two complete meals with what I ordered - at only $15, that's not bad, either.",

Taco Bell is better prices, better tasting, and bigger portions too!!!!  Also, almost 99% of Mexican food restaurants DO NOT charge for refills on chips and salsa, yet I was told it would be $2 per refill on the chips and salsa!!  Tacky!!!  Service was very bad and lack luster.....  Probably because the music was so loud that communication cannot be heard.  Very bad if you are on a date!  Can't even hear or make out conversations--- I guess you are suppose to be an expert at lip reading.   I travel all over the continental US, and have never been to a more horrible Mexican food place such as this.  Hard to believe that they are focused on more fluff such as ambiance than substance ---FOOD!  The flour tortillas are so undercooked and bland tasting!!  Awful!",

However I can't express the disappointment on Fathers day at Joyride. The the burritos and taco was cold and stuffed with rice rather than chicken or machaca. We were asked if we wanted red or green sauce unwillingly knowing that it cost $2 extra and it's not flavorable. We tried Barrio Cafe and was so good went 2 days in a row, or Los Dos Molinos both of them were flavorful and affordable authentic Mexican food. We will never return to Joyride!!",

I truly dont understand what is so difficult about basically making tacos  rice & beans. My tacos were ok. The beans were served cold & tasted like hormel out of a can so...sent them back. We sent back the \"salad\" not even sure the description matched what we got. The service....for what you pay..was eh & I HATE that you cant tell who does or doesn't work there. I realize Phoenix is a casual city for the love of God matching t-shirts the name of the restaurant on it so I know who you are might be nice. One of the worst part is where you have to stand to wait ... Seriously in the doorway? The drinks were good though. I might give it one more try maybe it was an off day? But nobody I know has given it rave reviews",

Drinks: I was excited to try their margaritas and they were just OK, I was not wowed unfortunately. Ambiance: Great, patio and open doors. Not too loud. Service: Great as well, never felt rushed or anything. Our served seemed a bit stoned, but hey, he didn't eat my food nor mess up anything so all OK.   I would have given it 5 star if: Margaritas kicked a$$ Tacos were a bit cheaper",

Salsa and chips tasty. Draft beer selection pretty good. The not so good: Mexican street corn- boiled not grilled. Mexican rice- too soft and bland. All tacos we had - shrimp, standard and chicken also bland. I'm not sure if it's the lack of salt, spice or if it's the flavor of the soft taco. Something wasn't right. We will probably try this place once more but if the food is not more flavorful- that will be the end.",

    "text": "Not too impressed with this hyped up place. Granted $2 tacos (only for taco Tuesdays) seem like a great deal, you can find other places that taste better and cost around the same amount.  Cons: -Long wait on taco Tuesday (over 2 hours for my party of 5) we came at 7pm and didn't get in and get our food till 9:30pm -Tacos, their star dish, was just okay. Some were flavored well, others weren't, which makes it not worth the long wait.  Pros: -Friendly service and workers (my party was kind of obnoxious and they handled us so well - they deserve 5 stars for service) -Yummy margaritas  -Yummy Mexican Street Corn  Would I come back to this place again? Yes I would, but on a different day where it isn't so busy and to venture out on their menu. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of the 2 hour wait just to get seated (something I'm not used to for dining in AZ). And also because I think their tacos were just okay compared to other places which have them for cheaper and shorter wait time.",

We arrived at 11:30 (before the lunch rush), quickly seated and received our chips. After our waiter stopped twice (we weren't ready to order) he disappeared not to be seen again. Then, we got the lunch special menu and we ordered from that. We also ordered margaritas ($5). The food was delicious and the margarita was great. The service was not good.",

    "text": "First let me start off by saying I love this place, and the tacos are great!   We go here pretty often at least every Tuesday for TACO TUESDAY! and normally receive good service.   Well today we waited well over an hour even tho we checked in be for we got there. (I know the system isn't that great, I got it no problem)   After finally being seated, we immediately got water, chips & salsa. Thats it, Lauren (our server) never came back to take our food order. After almost waiting 25 minutes, I flagged down the hostess that sat us to let her know like \"hey, no one has come to take our food order since you sat us\" she got the server over right away. Lauren comes and takes our order of 6 tacos total then leave.  We wait about another 25 minutes for our food. We sat there and watched people that sat after us get their drink and food orders before us. Finally the food comes out. I asked for cheese by the girl who brought us our order and she said no problem. In the meantime my tacos came out cold. I ate them as I was trying not to be extra when Lauren came to the table to ask if everything was ok. I tried to just order more tacos but Lauren looked me dead in my face and kept on walking. She wouldn't make any eye contact from that point on.   I never got my cheese, more chips & salsa or more tacos.   I don't understand why I had to watch Lauren be friendly to every other table but mines.  Of course I tipped her according to the service she gave me which was none and she had the nerve to come up to me and tap me on my shoulder and say \"if your going to dine out in public you need to tip\" no bitch if your gonna work as a server and solely rely heavily on tips you need to step your server game up.   I worked and ran restaurants for 10 years I know the game.   I will be back I just dont want Lauren as a server. The low review is for the server Lauren.   Joyride your staff is a reflection of you as a whole so hire people with great personalities.",

It was a birthday dinner for a friend, so unfortunately the thought of taking out my phone did not cross my mind.   I got a skinny margarita to drink. It was delicious! It is not listed on the menu but they made it for us. The guacamole was pretty good and had corn in it which I've never seen before. My friends ordered the street corn which I had a few bites of and it was VERY delicious! Slightly spicy but very tasty.   I ordered the veggie enchiladas with black beans. The veggie mix is sooo good. I've never really tried the tacos but I know those are what most people enjoy. The rice was also very good. Not a super traditional \"mexican rice\" they use a jasmine white rice and it comes with a green cilantro (I think) sauce on top. Different but still very tasty!  I know Joy Ride has super great happy hour deals. I've always gone for dinner but would love to go back for happy hour to try more of the appetizers or the tacos next time and one of the flavored, fruity margaritas!",

Located in the upbeat part of Phoenix and surrounded by its sister restaurants, the location features very nice outside patio with mist on a hotter days - the patio was rather cool and almost filled up on a late-June evening.   We ate inside (being new to the area, we didn't even consider the patio) - the service was very friendly, cocktails strong and tacos very tasty. The tacos are not super creative, but the flavor is great.  We also ordered guacamole (a bit too onion-y for me) and ensalada, which made our taco eating a bit healthier.   I definitely would like to come back for a few tacos and made be brave our 'the beast' burrito    For dessert we went to Churn (didn't even ask if they had a dessert menu)",

Although I saw a lot of people with the bright pink prickly pear marg and the blood orange marg), pitchers of beer, glass of wine and spiked Aguas frescas. All. Five. Dollars.  We split the veg out burrito (they split it for us). It had a light yet crispy tortilla, filled with veggies (squash, mushrooms, avocado, corn) and tons of delicious rice, with tomatillo salsa on the side (I could drink this stuff-it's that good). The burrito didn't fall apart as we ate it and we were stuffed afterwards. Even 40 minutes later we're still talking about how delicious it was.  We also got the fruity pebble and the banana Nutella churros. You literally can't go wrong. Crispy, lightly sugared, served warm, the perfect crunch. I'm drooling as I type this.  Awesome service, every server is super personable. They all work as a team and help out with every table so you can ask any server for anything. We had Hannah and Josh helped out toward the end. 2 other servers (not sure what their names were) also refilled our salsa/chips/drinks. We'll be back soon!",

Had the blood orange margarita and it was so good! Also ordered 2 tacos, one that they accidentally placed the wrong ordered for so ended up with the carnitas and the standard. I didn't mind having the wrong taco cause both were delicious. This is definitely gonna be a spot that I go often to for happy hour, I don't think you can beat it!",

They really do take well to feedback and I was so impressed with the flavors and as always, the Mexican Street corn. The margaritas are delicious and the serving staff is super attentive, professional and courteous. This is in the neighborhood for us, so I know we will be back. Adorable and fun ambience inside or outside. Plenty of parking too, I never have a problem grabbing parking here.",

    "text": "Mixed feelings on this one....................  My buddies rented an AirBnb right down the street from here.  We were hungry, and didn't want to travel far, so we walked down here for a late dinner on Thursday night.  Here is what I liked, and didn't like about the place.  Liked -  Dope ass vibe!  The inside is dark, chill, and they had some GREAT music playing the whole time we were there. -  Outside seating.  It was a bit chilly out, so they had the fire pit going as well as all the heaters.  We were seated at a table right next to the fire place. It was a tad too warm, but we moved the table a foot or two, and it was good after that.   -  Cucumber and Orange Salad-  This was great!  Kind of sad that I liked this better than the tacos, but whatever.........  This salad had marinated slices of cucumber, and some little pieces of mandarin/cutie type oranges as well as some seeds of some sort.  It was marinated really well and was absolutely delicious!   Would come here again, just for that. -  Chips and salsa.  Complimentary.  The chips were really tasty and the salsa was alright.    Didn't Like -  The tacos.  I was really, really wanting to like them.  I like most of the other restaurants around here (Federal Pizza, Churn etc) related to this restaurant group, but the tacos were just meh!   I went with 3 of them, an adobada, a carne asada, and a carnitas.  The carnitas was the best one of the bunch.  The carne asada was tender, but not the texture I prefer.  The adobada was shredded adobada instead of chunked like I prefer.  They were all pretty small, and the tortillas tasted a bit \"off\", too.  Everyone else at our table was a tad disappointed too.  Hipster tacos, for sure!    Consensus was that nobody would return here specifically for the tacos, but we WOULD return here for drinks/chips/salsa at the bar.  The vibe of this place is dope and I could see myself hanging out here drinking a margarita listening to some tunes.  Too bad the tacos were meh!",

If you order 3 tacos, you get to choose a side for $1  I ordered the Baja fish, shrimp, and the standard tacos. My favorite was the Baja fish. I wasn't much of a fan of the others but they weren't the most horrible either. Next time I will probably stick to just the Baja fish or try their other selections   We also ordered margaritas which were up to par  The service was really slow and it was hard to ask for service.   All in all I wouldn't mind coming back and would suggest patience when dining here especially on a Friday night.",

I really enjoyed the bits of teal and gold. The bar area was the center piece of the restaurant. There was plenty of seating and the bar area looked as lovely as the rest of the place. The bathrooms were similar decorated as well and very clean.  Let's get done to the food. We ordered nachos with carne asada. They were so good! The chips were very thick and crispy which worked out well since each nacho was jammed packed. We also had three tacos. We ordered the standard, carne asada and carnitas. Not going to lie, we are the nachos first and by the time we got to the tacos they were cold and the tortillas were chewy in a bad way. So would definitely recommend eating the tacos when they come out fresh. I also had the prickly pear margarita. It tasted amazing fresh and the tequila was smooth.",

SIDEWALK SURFER CHILAQUILES  Sunny-side up eggs, chicken, corn tortillas, pinto beans, avocado, asadero, queso fresco , salsa verde + fire-roasted salsa  Minus the beans,  and instead of chicken I asked for carne, and that was the right choice.  everything was matched up in perfect harmony. Every bit was flavorful and exciting. combined with the roasted pepper the right heat I loved it.  Kinda like maxwell house good to the last drop. I would come back just for the CHILAQUILES.  One more simple point price it did not break the bank.   Finally although I loved the CHILAQUILES I did leave wanting more I had to finish all the chips and my company's nachos. Before feeling satisfied. And more water more often would have been very appreciated.   All in all I do suggest going it's not disappointing. And this happy food happy joy food.",

They charge for chips after the first bowl. Tacos and Mexican food is a traction in AZ. You charge for chips and salsa. It's a rule. If I'm eating and drinking, there are a million places in Phoenix who will be happy to make sure I have some chips and salsa without haggling me over a couple of bucks. It's more the principal than the price.  Also, the cheapest Chardonnay is $10 a glass. Unless this is some punishment for mixing wine with tacos...which I understand...I don't get why they charge fine dinning prices for wine.   All-in-all...I still like this place. But, in AZ, the margin for error in Mexican food is super thin; and Joyride commits some unforced errors.",

Roasted veggies has a spicy creamy sauce on them I didn't like, but I ate around it. I sampled the Orange cucumber salad, and it was refreshing. They make a decent Bloody Mary; based on feedback from the rest of the group, the margaritas and mojitos were a group favorite.   The misters were turned on per our request, and the babes were happy and cool.   Parking is godawful, but it's not easy to find it on Central on any given day.",

The braised beef were melt in your mouth deliciousness. My friends topped off their beast burritos in no time, but I would stick to their tacos.

It's refreshing when I did not have to wait for 'my' waitress, anyone there is capable to service you. The citrus aqua Fresca with gin was so so good; pleasantly surprised. The tacos were also delicious, the crispy fish had a great crust to it.

It is a unique and hidden gem nestled between Postino's and Federal Pizza. The food and service was amazing and I enjoyed all of the food and drink recommendations made by the servers. I definitely recommend the pineapple agua Fresca with vodka added, the chicken burrito, and the bottomless chips and salsa (the chips are a little salty, but can be easily washed down with a agua Fresca or another one of their tasty beverages!)   All of the servers made us feel welcome, wanted, and appreciated. I plan on returning again soon for another happy hour with friends!",

    "text": "My co-worker and I decided to grab a table on the bright and cheery front patio, filled with sunshine yellow chairs.  We immediately appreciated the fact that they saved the two substantial trees that helped to block the noise from Central Avenue.  Now down to business.  We were greeted by our server, who quickly brought our beverages, crunchy chips and salsa for starters.    For lunch I ordered the \"Lunch Special\" which was a choice of 2 tacos (served on made-to-order corn tortillas) and choice of soup or small salad for around $10.  I chose the Shrimp Taco (with grilled shrimp, Mexican slaw and pico gringo), the Carnitas Taco (shredded pork, tomatillo salsa, cilantro & onion) and the Rhythmic Beet Salad (mixed greens, beets, papaya, avocado, goat cheese, toasted pepitas, cilantro & scallions in a honey champagne vinaigrette(recommended by our server).     Everything was DELICIOUS!  And although I had plenty of food, I found myself wishing that I could order more just to try the great-looking combinations.  Every taco has slightly different ingredients. Not just a change in the protein, like most traditional Mexican restaurants. They also don't come with the heavy grease and mountains of grated cheddar cheese that you'll find on the majority of valley tacos. Each item was light, fresh and yummy!    The service was prompt, friendly and courteous too!  I can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu.  I'll be sure to take my camera for pictures too.",

We got things done quicker by asking random servers that passed by, rather than our server doing it.   Will try again and get the stars up hopefully.",

    "text": "Updated from my previous review... Great for a margarita and a bowl of chips and salsa... But if you LOVE tacos, I'm sad to say - go elsewhere. If you've never been to Mexico or had an authentic street taco you might think these are great as they use fresh decent ingredients and the spice them well.... But thats where the praise ends. In my opinion, tacos should be on corn tortillas unless flour is requested. Here they all come out on flour. Next, the ingredients must be HOT! Never serve lukewarm (from a steam tray on the line) food! Everything must be HOT! Two of the three tacos  (carnitas and asada) were room temp at best as if taken right off of a steam table of pre cooked and kept meat... Takes just a few seconds to sear and crisp up the asada or carnitas... Instead, cold and soggy tacos. The third also was a disappointment. The crispy fish was fishier than crispy... Like tilapia or other bottom feeder... Skip it. The staff is friendly, the drinks are great on happy hour, and there are other places to go after you are done with your chips to get great tacos. :)",

    "text": "Not bad; we'll probably put it in the rotation of places to eat, but it really doesn't stand out.  -Food was good. I had three standard tacos with a side of pinto beans and was happy with everything. High quality marinated chicken, and an avocado slice on top was a great addition.  -Service: um, ok. Our waitress was friendly, but service was somewhat slow. Took 5-10 minutes for our waitress to show up after we were seated, 5 minutes for our drinks to come out, then another 5-10 for her to return to take our food order. We stopped in for lunch on our day off, but if I had to return to work within an hour I would have been getting nervous...  -Value: No major issues. We averaged about $17 per person. We missed Taco Tuesday by an hour :( (it starts at 2pm). Seriously though, a Mexican restaurant charging $2 for seconds on chips?? That takes some brass ones. Not cool.  -Atmosphere: I really like the 50s/60s decorations. It fits the neighborhood and the building well. The patio surrounds three sides of the restaurant and looks like it would be beautiful after the sun goes down, but there's not a lot of shade out there, so avoid during the day. The background music was pleasant, but it was way too loud. We had to raise our voices just to converse.  One major positive that you don't really see with these trendy/hipster type of restaurants is that this place is good for both kids and adults. A lot of the newer restaurants in the valley seem to make their restaurant like a nightclub that serves food, but this place the whole family could easily enjoy.  -Parking: The restaurant was about 85% full for lunch and we snagged the last parking spot. I could see this being a problem on a Friday/Saturday night. We were there for a Tuesday lunch.  -Bathroom: The bathrooms are individual one person at a time rooms, so they're probably empty over 50% of the time. In the one I used there was a pyramid of 15 rolls of toilet paper stacked on a cabinet with a lit candle in front of them. You do the math.",

Ever since I moved down here a year ago I couldn't find a good Mexican food place and well this was super good Mexican food! Salsa and chips for free we're spot on! love love love this place! Highly recommend and also the set up in the place is super relaxed and just a really hang out spot too as well",

Step in to a overly retro 60's themed inside, from the lamps to the wallpaper you would think you are in Austin powers. The patio is nice despite the terrible metal chairs.   You will be greeted by the obligatory chips and salsa, but it is nice that they don't charge extra for this staple.   The menu has salads tacos burritos and tortas. For vegetarians its pretty much salads, a taco or a burrito. For the best value go for the burrito it is full of great items like mushrooms and roasted veggies all for $8 they will even make it a heart friendly chimichanga for no extra charge.   I tried a trio of tacos that included a side for a grand total of $14. They were good but more of an appetizer than a meal. Luckily there were more chips to gorge on.",

Trevor is an terrific server - attentive and friendly without being overbearing. Everyone from the hostess to the bussers were all very polite and helpful.

    "text": "Found this place on yelp.  It has a hip vibe and was very crowded at 1 pm on a Saturday afternoon.  Music was annoyingly loud, but we were among the older patrons.    Following our server's advice, I ordered the pork adobada and carne Asada tacos.  DH ordered those two plus the crispy fish taco.  It took an extremely long time for our plates to arrive.  No employee bothered to tell us our food would eventually arrive.  They give you chips and salsa as soon as you sit.  Salsa looked good but was boring with no distinct flavor.  DH said his meal was perfect.  Unfortunately mine was not. I was given the Adobada and another taco. I asked my husband if the second taco looked like his fish taco and he said no.  I am super careful because I can get anaphylaxsis from cod or snapper.    I looked for a server, any server, but could not get anyone's attention for a few minutes.   After staring at it I finally bit into a tiny corner of the taco.  It was definitely fish. No anaphylaxis, but a slight itchy allergic reaction.  It took a few more minutes of waving my arm to attract the attention of a server who took the dish away. Finally, our server came over since I had no food.  We  told her I was given a fish taco. She knew I ordered the pork and beef tacos.  She said she would check on my replacement plate  The new plate came with no apology and the tacos were great. They each had a unique flavor with a nice balanced, yet interesting mix of spices.   It's very sad that neither server expressed concern over the mix up.  People who do not have serious allergies often do not understand that they can kill someone by serving the wrong food.  I stop breathing if I eat certain fish or peanuts.  No offer to do anything except bring me what I ordered after my husband finished his tacos.  Also, the menu said one free side order if you order three tacos.  The server did not mention that to DH.  Then, when the waitress brought our change she shortchanged my husband. He tipped her, but maybe should have skipped the tip so she might realize the service was very poor.  No stars for service and 5 stars for food. If I lived in Phoenix I would probably eat here because the food is that good.  I think they probably have other servers who care more about doing a good job.  However, I haven't tried other Phoenix restaurants of this genre so maybe there are better ones.",

Enter on the SW side under a canopy of mature trees and see the sliding panel doors wide open.  Very spacious footprint.  A few rounds of chips and salsa are included.  The service?  Rock solid.  Sat at the bar.  Bartender was mostly attentive.  I was rather impressed that all bartenders remained busy, wiping down the bar and bottles.  The bartenders worked as a team which is always nice. Here is why we are actually hovering around a 2-3, yes I want to rate this place a 2...The food?  The complimentary chips and salsa area served in a round tin.  The chips are fresh and served with the right amount of salt.  The salsa?  Flat bland.  :(  The Bandit Taco plate - served with fresh slices of avocado and yummy, fresh, tortillas.  Comes with beans per the menu.  However, you did not get to pick; served with black beans..All the proteins were bland, like the salsa.  With no additional salsas to add, tacos were a bust.    Again - great service and location.  Food was not inspiring.",

    "text": "Were seated immediately, giving water and chips and salsa within the first 30 seconds of being seated. The chips were super yummy and the salsa was lightly mild.  We had enough chips and salsa to go around 3 people which is nice. We went for Taco Tuesday, $2 tacos and also some special rates on other products. I got 3 carne Asada tacos and 1 shrimp taco which wasn't featured on the taco Tuesday list. The tacos themselves were small, about the size of your palm. The shrink taco was okay, it was kissing something, like a spice of sals... The carne Asada tacos were amazing, they were seasoned great and grilled to perfection. Very flavorful! For an app I got the Mexican corn taken off the Cobb. It was sweet and had a taste of garlic. Not a lot of cheese or mayo, it was lightly sprinkled on... It was obviously the company's take on Mexican street corn, none the less it was yummy. We also got two sides, pinto beans that were cooked with chorizo and some delicious rice covered in tomatillos sauce.   Small parking lot in rear and side, we went for an early dinner but by 5 we saw the parking started to build up. The place itself is decorated nicely Ana the staff was friendly. I'd definitely come back again!",

    "text": "My husband and I went for a late lunch. We've been here several times, but never managed to find time to write a review.   We started with the Mexican street corn.  Super yum! I would definitely get this again. Smoky paprika and cojita cheese- lime aioli. Wow!  I got the new blueberry flavored margarita called the Sloe Ride. It was tart and ok, but I prefer the Cucumber Serrano margarita which I got second. But I always lean toward whatever is spicy. My second margarita ended up being free, as the bar seemed to forget to make it. Our server corrected the error by getting it for me ASAP and then took it off our tab.  Husband had a pitcher of San Tan Epicenter which he thought  was a great/yummy beer for our hot weather.   We both got different burritos. We both agreed The Beast was better than the Machaca burrito. I will definitely go for The Beast next time. The smokey carne asada  inside was so very flavorful. I will dream about this burrito. The burritos are served cut in half, so it was very easy to share.   Now to the part which makes me score Joyride down a star. The chips. What is with the tortilla  chips? They are so boring. We paid $5 to have the salsa \"flight.\" My favorite was the Charred Habanero. Oh what a lovely burn that kept growing the more I ate it! Second favorite was the Fire Roasted (first bowl is free) followed  by the Pico Gringo, and then Tomatillo. The chips tasted like a cheap store brand and contributed nothing to this meal. I live tortilla chips generally. But it these.  Please fix this misdeed ASAP Joyride. We love you otherwise and drive to you all the way from Surprise.",

It does get CRAZY busy. So, have patience when you come here. It is worth it tho.",

We started off with guacamole, it was unique with roasted corn, cojito cheese and tomatillos.   The crispy fish taco was flavorful and delivered exactly as it was described.  The braised beef taco was also bold in flavor, however the meat was much more chewy that it should have been.  The drinks were amazing and you can't go wrong with the happy hour price.    The only downfall to Joyride is the service.  You don't have one waitress the entire time, so drinks may or may not be refilled and it might take a while for them to \"check\" on your table to see if you need anything or even take your order.   Feeding 3, which includes 3 adult beverages and an appetizer for $38 made this place a little sweeter - you can't beat the happy hour prices at Joyride Taco House.   As long as you don't mind the service being inconsistent.",

Luckily a couple of my friends were able to save a table a bit earlier so when I arrived, there was no wait. And they were enjoying some $5 margaritas so I don't think they minded waiting on me a few minutes.  Ample free parking across the street is a huge plus too.  We were seated inside at one of the regular tables close to the bar. Once I joined everyone, I got started with a margarita too. I opted for the blood orange which was really good. Good enough to order a second!  As for my entree, I came for the $2 tacos and ended up going with carnitas, carne, and chicken. They came out pretty fast along with everyone elses orders, who also got a variety of tacos.  We thoroughly enjoyed our food and would definitely come back again. $2 tacos and $5 margs are the kind of happy hour deals worth planning a Tuesday around!",

As far as food is concerned, the chips and salsa are tasty but they charge you for extra. That's fine if the main course comes out promptly, but to charge for extra chips and salsa while waiting for food for 15 plus minutes is ridiculous.  The tacos are good, not great.  The service was ok, no one went above and beyond.  We often had empty glasses needing refills and it would take a while for the server(s) to come by and refill them.

Whether a busy 'taco Tuesday' or a Friday evening date night, the whole team works together for some of the best service in the city! Always.  All the tacos are great and if I'm ever on death row, I'll want their chips & salsa and a Joyride, 'Blood Orange Margarita' before they put me in the chair!",

The bar tender offered up a recommendation which I went with.  Had 3 tacos; carne asada, pork adabado and Baja crispy fish, plus a heaping bowl of guacamole garnished with slices of fresh Serrano chilies.  My friend had four tacos which included an extra carne asada!  Excellent bar and although the bar tenders were busy they took the time to chat with us which made us feel very welcome but most importantly the G&Ts were well made.  We Got there around 5 pm, there was already a nice crowd with positive energy.  I really liked the food here, great flavor and good variety.  Give it a try and let me know what you think!",

Whoops...Yet the Sunday night manager rectified everything quickly and with a smile.  The food was delicious, and this is the second time I have been here and they are 2 for 2.

The night we went here, we literally tossed a coin to see which restaurant we should go to, and Joyride won. I'm so glad we went because I was very pleasantly surprised as soon as I walked in the door. The decor, colors, lighting were all fabulously 1960's style, but strangely enough has a very clean modern feel to it as well. We were seated in a booth which looked out on the welcoming patio with a fireplace. I ordered one of the freshly infused waters and the enchiladas and the bf ordered the machaca burrito. After downing our delicious chips & salsa, our food came and the presentation was (almost) as delicious as it tasted. I am an enchilada fiend and order them almost every time at a Mexican restaurant. I loved that half was drenched in mole sauce, the other half in verde salsa. I wasn't a huge fan of the verde sauce, I have to admit. It was a little too thick and peppery.  My boyfriend's burrito came cut into two halves and was delicious!  We will be back for sure. Their happy hour and lunch specials look great.",

We boyfriend and I got there at 530pm.  The chips and salsa are complimentary, but the salsa was thick and tasted like they used alot of chili powder.  My boyfriends loves salsa and he couldn't even eat it.  I compare all my salsa to my favorite at Mi Patio, and I haven't found anything that compares to it, so I wasn't expecting anything better, but this salsa was really bad. We both ordered a margarita.  The drinks came in a standard size bar glass. I also ordered just one taco...a shrimp taco. The big surprise was the bill...$9/ea for the margaritas...and $4.25 for the taco.  I felt like I just threw $30 out the window. Oh, and there's NO happy hour.  I was told the happy hour was from 11a to 5pm.  What?? Yes, it's hip, yes, it's cool...and I don't mind paying for great food/drinks, but it was definitely not worth the high prices.  The margaritas would've been priced around $4.25 at any other mexican joint and that tiny taco should've been about $1.25!  The tortilla was the size of a small pancake and had just 2...yes 2...shrimp inside..we each got a bite. I'm still kicking myself for paying that kind of money for nothing special!",

Wifey spotted it the other day and we decided to check it out yesterday. It just opened on Tuesday, so it was perfect timing. The location is great, it's located right next to Postino on Central. The decor is done awesome, very urban but warm if that makes sense. The restaurant was very busy but seemed to run like a well oiled machine. We were seated pretty quick, they have a nice patio and tons of indoor/bar dining options. We started with a few cocktails, traditional margarita and I went with the blood orange margarita. Wifey wasn't over the moon about her traditional margarita, was a bit flat but my  blood orange margarita was great. they have a well rounded menu with tacos, tamales, tortas, burritos and a few specials. They also have a short list of apps/shareable plates. we started with the guacamole, which was done perfect. I opted for 3 tacos: Fried fish, braised beef and this spicy chicken. They were all great, my fave being the  braised beef. I also got the Mexican street corn, which was delicious. Wifey got the Chilaquiles, and LOVED her dish. They even have a kids menu for my daughter, which is always welcome. All in all, great good, superior service and perfect location. I'll for sure be back!",

At almost $4 each for a \"street taco\" I would expect a bit more discovery in the taste bud area. However, the tortilla soup was great. Service on the other hand was mildly annoying. Three different employees came to our table during the meal. I'm not quite sure who was the server, the runner, the busser. The one I'm assuming was the server took our order, stopped by once and ...poof. Never saw the person again. We were left sitting with empty dishes and that we-need-to-get-back-to-work-look on our faces way too long. Everyone was nice, but the restaurant manager needs to tighten up the service process if one expects weekday/workday lunch crowd approval.",

Everyone is friendly but every time we dine here whether its busy or slower it takes forever for anything. To take our order, getting our drinks, getting our order, our check etc. I don't seem to have this problem at their other neighboring establishments just Joyride.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place. I love all the other spots from the group who did Joyride. The fresh chips and salsa were good! But the salsa verde we ordered wasn't. I ordered the almond horchata aqua fresca, but they were out. Okay, fine. So I order citrus. Nope. Pineapple? Sorry. The waiter was great and comped the mango one I finally ended up with. The service really was good here, albeit the bar was incredibly slow. As in, took 10-15 minutes each time we ordered drinks.   So, onto the food. I got three tacos: carne asada, crispy fish (server's recommendation), and the chicken tikka. The best was the asada. It had a really good flavor and had that same smoked salsa they'd served with the chips. Too many raw white onions. Sadly, it was cold, as were all of my tacos. The chicken tikka really could have been great, but it was cold. The flavors were there, though. The crispy fish: yuck. Fish was cold and flavorless, the sauces had no taste. Wholly disappointing. I had the black beans for my side. They desperately needed salt and some seasoning. My boyfriend got the Mexican slaw. It too lacked flavor. All in all, I was disappointed. I adore Federal and Windsor, so I had high hopes. I definitely see room for improvement. I hope they get better, but I won't be trying again.",

The chef himself brought me a  new taco, they knocked it off my bill anyway and even gave me a free drink. I always sit at the bar, so I can't comment on the wait staff but the place looks like they only hire attractive tattooed people. No complaints here. Drinks appear to be strong too... Still typing.",

Speaking of margs I'm not a huge fan but I had a sip of my wife's blood orange marg and it was ridiculously good.  The street corn was right up there with the best I've had and we loved the braised beef taco (we also shared the crispy fish and the standard which were good but the beef was by far our fav).

    "text": "You let me down, Yelp!  For the first time ever, Yelp has been way off on this one. Like some of the other reviewers, I too am obsessed with Upward Projects restaurants. Which was why I was even more excited to see this new place getting great Yelp reviews. And as we walked in, the ambiance got my hopes even higher. Here's why we are never going back:  -Over 30 minute wait, and they don't serve anything but chips and salsa in the cocktail area. It was even more frustrating to see empty tables inside during the entire duration of our wait. Poor service on the patio.  -When we were seated, no one greeted us for 5-10 minutes. Very odd, a server finally came up and asked if we were \"still doing alright?\" Umm since we've been here for over 45 minutes, were ready to order.   -Food came up quick but was mediocre at best. A beer I ordered when the food arrived wasn't brought until everyone was done eating. Attitude from the waitress when I sent it back.   -At some point during our meal, a waiter approached us confirming he had given the card back from our tab on the patio. We told him he hadn't so he said he would look for it.  -While waiting for our bill, at least 4 people asked us if we wanted more chips and salsa. No, but wed like the bill! It finally came but the waitress didn't even make eye contact so we couldn't tell her they still had our card!!! Another 5-10 minutes we finally flag down another server and ask her to find our card. She brings it and takes it with the bill. Several minutes later we see her arranging a table for a large party and wonder where she put our bill. Then our waitress comes and asks where the bill is, and as were pointing out the other server a 3rd server drops it off. This place is certainly some kind of ride! What a mess. Won't be going back.",

I'm a big fan of Upward Project but this place isn't my cup of tea...the first time I went it was opening week. One of the owners spilt a glass of water on me but they compensated by giving our table a complimentary appetizer. We had the ceviche and am glad it was complimentary because it did not taste that great. I ordered one of the burritos  and asked for enchilada style...the sauce was sweet. How can chile sauce be sweet?!? The rice was not cooked and the beans were bland....since it was opening week I decided not to judge the place by my first meal..  We decided to give it another try. The food again was lackluster. And the service was great at the beginning but after they dropped off our food we never saw our server again. Thank goodness they have other options that I enjoy. Just wished Joyride would was more authentic with the flavors...",

I contacted Natalie, Joyride's Catering Manager, who made recommendations and sent quotes for my review.  Everything looked great, a delicious dinner for 20 at a good price.  Party day arrived and 30 minutes in the food had not arrived. Then reality hit, I had given Joyride my brother's birthday date which was on Sunday and the party was on Saturday.    In a panic, I called Joyride and they could not have been more gracious.  After checking with their kitchen, they assured me that, yes, they could get the order done AND they got it done in 30 minutes.  Guests had a little more time to enjoy their drinks and appetizers and no one was the wiser.    Everyone loved their Braised Beef and Veggie tacos and the crunchy delicious side of Mexican Slaw.  Joyride really came through for me and I am grateful.",

Top notch, complete with co-ed bathrooms.  The happy hour is very appealing as well, and I would say this is a great place to stop in and have lunch (or what the heck, start your friday night).  Chips and salsa were very tasty, and the guacamole dip (with sliced jalapenos - brilliant)!  Good five dollar pitcher specials (sorry, I am never one of those helpful people that can quote you what the time frames are) but I think 11-5).  But worth looking into.  Couple things I will say on the negative side (yeah I know, wish ever review could be positive and amazing), the cheese-mas dip (basically cheese queso) was okay, but NWTC (not worth the calories in my opinion).    Tacos - if you love tacos and are really a connessieur, you might not love these.  The crunchy fish taco was okay, but really just like eating a fish-stick on a tortilla if you know what i mean.  Good, but not a huge fan.  The other tacos (carnitas, chicken tinga, and baja fish) were so-so, didn't seem to be served very warm and for me, just lackluster taste overall.  Alcohol - I tried the \"hi-ball margarita\" (supposedly their version of the cadillac as I was informed) in my opinion is (how can I say this nicely) not the greatest value.  Try one and see if you agree.  I think they need to up their game in this area.  So at the end of the day, I love the location, love what they have done with the place, great vibe, staff is friendly and very energetic, MUSIC ROCKS (possibly best in town, loud but I like it that way) and so I find myself a big fan, but looking for a go-to meal that I can call my own.  Yes, I will be back hunting for that in round 2 and open to any great suggestions.  And by the way guys, you need to sell some cool t-shirts (love bright colors, great to promote your brand), and give discounts to bike riders.  We like to ride our bikes with friends!!  Have fun, and find your sizzle!

    "text": "Finally made it to this place.  Every time I've noticed the place, it has a good sized crowd on the patios and it looks like a good time. Kind of fell short.  The Mexican food is like a tex-mex fare which really isn't what I look for in Mexican food.  In fairness, that's my preference and there's probably quite a few people who look for this speciality of the Mexican food class so just expect that kind of menu. The ceviche was pretty good though.  Update- I have been going back to this place monthly...the ceviche brought me back and I think I can be called a regular now...my wife has the Veggi tacos which she likes about as much as my love of the ceviche.  The place turned me around, great bar to eat at....apologies to the owners for the initial lackluster review...I think were all good now.",

We had a large enough group several items on the menu got tried.  I had the enchiladas and they let me have one of each.  They were both good.  Normally they serve it with both red and green sauce, next time I would ask for all red as I preferred it.  The salsas and guacamole were great.  The only thing lackluster to me was the beans.  Of those that had tacos it seemed like the fish came in last with shredded beef winning the day.  All of them were good, just in different degrees.  This is just a wonderful spot to gather on a spring day in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Braised beef taco and fried fish taco!!   The restaurant opened recently and I think it's gonna be one of the new trendy places to go to this year. It was very busy when 4 of us went and waited about a half hour on a Friday night. It was our first time there and the ceviche really stood out so we tried to order that but the server said they sold the last one, but recommended the tuna stack. It was good, and makes me curious what the ceviche would be like.   So, they have this deal in the menu, when you order three tacos, you get a side for free. I chose the braised beef, the fried fish taco, and the chicken taco with a lime aioli sauce and the rice on the side. I didn't like the chicken at all, but the braised beef was juicy and succulent and yum!! My friend also states the grilled fish taco was great too! But he didn't like the carne asada, it was too sweet, he said. He also ordered pinto beans as his side but the server said the last one sold out too, so he settled for black beans   The servers were all really busy but still very Attentitive. I took off a star because of the food that wasn't available and because when a different server brought out our food, they only brought 8 tacos and I said we ordered nine and we had to straighten it out with the original server first before they brought out the last taco. Just a tiny hiccup in an otherwise seamless night.   They also have unique drink choices. They have these juices from freshly squeezed fruits which can be served with alcohol. I tried the cucumber mint with gin and it was very refreshing!",

Sitting at the bar we got our margaritas, got our tacos, and all is well. After our tacos arrived, our bartender essentially checked out. Didn't ask how our food was. Our glasses sat empty for 15 minutes (not an exaggeration) and we sat with empty taco plates in front of us as well. Had he asked, we both would of ordered another drink. Instead we decided to leave. Wanted to pay our check. But the blonde haired bartender was more concerned about putting his tips in Aloha than making sure his guests are taken care of. So I had to flag down a hostess to help us get a check. Now I would like to blame the bartender for this, but this clearly is managements fault. It's evident this employee was either not trained properly or management's service expectations are minimal at best.",

The tacos feature delicious hand-made corn tortillas,  fresh pico, fresh guac, and they're exquisitely seasoned-- including the veggie ones that are so good they'll satisfy even the most picky meat eater. Delicious sides include the must-have cucumber orange salad, and desserts feature fresh made ice cream from sister-business \"Churn\" across The street.  The staff? On the ball and attentive are understatements. They're also extremely friendly and accommodating-- especially for a joint this busy. Topping it off is a retro-modern atmosphere coupled with wicked good music. Wrap it all up with a cozy-lit full bar and almost unbelievably reasonable prices for a place this good, and anyone with a discriminating palate and taste for tacos and legit margaritas should be coming here weekly -- if not more often!",

We then called back 3 more times, and were told that the manager was not available, to try back again later. We called the next morning to try and pay for our order AGAIN, and surprise surprise, it was never even written down. It's now about an hour before we need the order to be ready.

Next came our waiter, a newbie to Arizona from Arkansas, with a cute southern drawl, easy demeanor and not bad on the eyes, either.  But most importantly, he was SO attentive.  Especially since one of our diners is gluten-free, lactose intolerant.  He guided us through the menu, made great recommendations, even went back to confer with the chefs to be sure everything was done correctly.  We each ordered the taco trios, an array of different smells, proteins, veggies graced our table.  Each of us having a favorite.  It was topped off with warm, sugary churros accompanied with a chocolate dipping sauce, on the house for our birthday boy.  We will definitely be back.  We enjoy that part of town, seeing old buildings (used to be Humpty Dumpty's Restaurant) coming alive.  Oh, and ask for Jeremy.  Hope he sticks around.",

    "text": "Can we bring back traditional service please?!! This place had the potential to be a very nice experience but the service was terrible. They have decided to not assign a specific server to your table but rather have all staff chip in to order, clear tables, bring out food, like they do in Chinese restaurants, with disastrous results! Plates of grilled corn, soup, burritos kept coming to our table, no one knew who had what plate and being the large table we were, you can only imagine the havoc with constant unnecessary interruptions. It seemed like none of the tables were numbered as is usually the business model in most restaurants to help staff know which table to bring food to. It was amusing at first but awful, add to that I looked at my bill and was shocked to find out my regular priced margarita, at about an ice filled tumbler's worth cost 9 dollars each! Even paying for the bill was a tedious, the lady did not know who had what and had to go back and do the splitting all over again as we sat there for about 20 minutes just waiting to leave. The manager then came out after our bidding and apologized, and gave us a bunch of vouchers. Get it together people!",

They have s great waiting area for when there is a rush, and provide chips and salsa for you while you wait. Drinks are pricey but FANTASTIC I got the cucumber mint fresca and it was amazing. My fiance got the strawberry fresca and he liked his as well. I would stick to ordering the tacos on the menu, the standard and crunchy fish were our groups favorites. Best appetizer is the guacamole, it's handmade and very tasty! I wasn't a huge fan of the salsa they give with the chips, but you can order a different kind for 2 dollars so it's not too bad. Service is usually very friendly and very low key which is nice. The valet parking truly is complementary which is nice in a city where parking sucks. We're more likely to visit the gilbert location since we are in the east valley but if we lived closer we would come back frequently for sure!",

    "text": "Similar to Gallo Blanco, it's style over substance here.  Maybe it's just my palate, but there's nothing more discouraging then knowing what something is probably going to taste like before you even order it: sickeningly sweet margaritas and inedible, salty food.  I love Mexican food, but very picky having grown up in So Cal.  Even so, I thought I'd give an open mind.  We started with some guac, which for $8, came served in a tiny dish and was riddled with brown pieces.  We sent it back for another only to find brown pieces (surprise) folded under good pieces.  The staff informed us \"this happens after sitting out for a few minutes\".  A few minutes??  Oxidization occurs after a few hours...not minutes. Yuck.  I know guac.  Come on.  I then ordered the Lola Salad (striving to add some greens to this meal) which was mostly quinoa (how did I miss \"grain\" in the description...sorry, \"Lola GRAIN salad\".  I then reluctantly (anticipating another bad experience with a similar item at Gallo Blanco) ordered the \"Beast Burrito\" which ultimately confirmed that it was conceived for the menu by very small eyes. Chipotle gives you a hardier serving...this was a below average size.  I didn't understand what was so \"beasty\" about it.  This turned out for the better as it contained predominately black and refried beans in addition to a bit of over cooked, drowning-in-salt marinade-based carne asada.  There was a nauseatingly sweet taste (fire roasted salsa??) and it was luke warm.  It was very much like Gallo Blanco's carne asada burrito. And my worst peave, BROWNED tortilla to give it a hard, card board like texture. WHY?  WHY must you do this? The whole thing screamed \"left over\". I couldn't finish it.  Blah.  The only thing that my mind could imagine being worse is if it had been deep fried into a chimichanga!!!    Overall, predictable and not great food.  I'll give it another try some other time, but messing up guac is really annoying and not being able to finish an entree because it's so gross just made it worse.  Hard to find places that don't pander to the point of exhaustion...I don't think you'll get a better experience at say Blanco Tacos either.  Overly thought menu items that just don't deliver.    Sorry, better luck next time. If I can muster up the nerve to go back.",

Well, I wouldn't say it's the best Mexican food in town, but I will say it is worth the trip. The ambience is excellent. I love the teal and burnt orange colors and the retro/modern decor. The restaurant is gorgeous inside and out. There are plenty of large tables for bigger parties, so this makes a great place to bring your friends.   Drinks are pretty good. I have tried the house margarita, high roller margarita, and the pineapple agua fresca. I will say the house marg is just 'meh'. The other two are tasty.   I have tried the chicken tinga, carne asada, and braised beef tacos. All three are good, but none blew me away. I would recommend the black beans as a side. They are very tasty!  Overall, this is a great place to drink, munch on chips, and maybe eat a street taco or two. I see it more as a hang out a few hours after dinner or a late night dining option. It's definitely a fun place and I will be going back regularly!",

It's extremely loud so forgot about having a normal conversation with people.  They charge you $3 to refill your chips and salsa.  The salsa was super hot with no option for a mild salsa.  I had the standard and the carnitas tacos and they were good but the side of Joyrice tasted like the packets of rice you buy from the store.  My kids got the nachos off the kids menu and neither of them ate them.  The kids were fried and gross and the cheese type substance on top was interesting.  If you want good tacos and a better atmosphere, head down the street to Taco Guild.",

My daughter ate all of her food which is very rare,  and the (I'm guessing the manager) made my daughter a hot chocolate wich they don't even serve.  My chicken burrito was amazing, the cheese dip was amaaazing.  The coffee and chocolate ice cream brownie were fantastic. They went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect and always was there right on time.  Not to mention the decor was beautiful.  We will be coming back many more times.  Thank you joyride",

Larry the manager was very professional and awesome.   All our needs were catered to, he was on top of things and accommodated our our requests. The rest of the staff was very friendly and patient. This is my fav places to go to and have always been happy with the ambience and service. Management: Larry needs to be recognized and promoted.. He has what it takes to be in a leadership position.    Great customer service,friendly , aware of the restaurants workflow. Thanks Larry and your crew.",

I frequent Upward Project Restaurants and the service tonight was better than I could ever expect or have had! Justin was our server and he took great care of us! The chips and drinks were never short and the tacos we ordered were out of this world! I loved the carnitas, pork and shrimp tacos with the Asian slaw. The food was cooked to perfection. I would highly recommend Joyride to anyone interested in great tacos, awesome drinks and incredible service! To make your experience even more 5 star ask for Justin for your server!",

We legitimately enjoyed the service, food, and margaritas we received; however, we were taken aback by the additional charges to our bill. In short, we had additional charges totaling $26 that we brought to our server's attention which he rectified by giving us two free margaritas that equalled $18. We ate the difference but were conflicted after we were: 1. Charged for an extra drink we didn't order, 2. Not comped a drink that was promised by our waiter after we had waited over 15 minutes for it, and 3. Charged regular prices on 2 margaritas that we ordered during happy hour. Overall, we will likely return but plan to be much more vigilant with regard to our check.",

Its so yummy and delicious that you cant just have one.   Ive had the Crispy fish, carne asada, shrimp & chicken tinga tacos. Now I am the type of person that doesn't need a fancy taco, basically because there are a lot of things I cannot eat because of my stomach. So that being said, I ordered the above tacos with no cabbage, no mexican slaw & no white magic. Trust me, they didn't even need it. These tacos are would be good with just the meat and tortilla, must be those corn tortillas.  Joy rice with tomatillo salsa & the bomb black beans are also good. But, do yourself a favor and order the orange cucumber salad, trust me you will love it!  If you have been to Joyride and did not get dessert, YOU NEED TO GO BACK and order Mo's Definitely  Oh and I cant forget, the service is always outstanding!",

Today was the hard open, and I must say, I'm pretty impressed. I love how the staff rotates between Windsor, Parlor, Postino's, and now here. Upon arrival, we were greeted with fresh tortilla chips and deliciously spicy fire roasted salsa, and served our beers shortly thereafter. We opted for the ceviche appetizer to start, and damn! I'm a ceviche addict, and theirs rivals Hula's in awesomeness. Fresh shrimp, tomato, avocado, cucumber, onion, the obligatory lime juice, and... jicama. Jicama! Quite a satisfying crunch. For our entree, my accomplice and I split the El Capitan torta- a fresh toasted bun with carne asada, salsa, avocado, and shredded lettuce. The torta COULD be piled a little higher, based on the size of the bun, but the flavors were stellar, fresh, and just plain freaking delicious! We closed the meal out with fresh churros with chocolate dipping sauce, but I was much too full too eat more than half of one! Rest assured, Joyride is now on our roster of neighborhood restaurants to bicycle to. I'm in love!",

I was charged 12.00 each for them during happy hour because I requested Casa Noble tequila which may or may or have been used, which the waitress advise me of the up charge. The way the menu is set up, I thought it was the price of margarita.  I also ordered two tacos- carne asada and the chicken and nothing special, both a little salty.

We were given complimentary chips - and the chips weren't too bad. I am a little picky on the types of chips I get at restaurants.   The guacamole had sea salt on it - my preference is that they can do without it. You can order three tacos, and get a free side.

I'd asked where could I get some pretty good mexican and a decent Margarita and she said I had to come to Joyride so here I was. Visited with 3 others and we opted to wait for our table at the bar. We were immediately greeted with smiles and Chips/Salsa. Of course I started with a Margarita and opted for the Prickly Pear as I'd never had it before. My friends opted for a Prickly Pear as well and the Blood Orange Margarita. I'll start by saying they were pretty strong (YES!) and the flavors were lovely but I did not notice a huge difference in flavor between the prickly pear and blood orange however. Time flew by and we were escorted to our table only to be greeted by our lovely waitress \"Kait\" please note this is the correct spelling as she did write it down for me. Kait, was lovely for so many reasons. First she has a fantastic demeanor/attitude and was able to not only answer all our questions about the food but also made other suggestions I may not have considered. Like the best melted cheese over my veggie burrito, HELLO, that was THE BEST mind you, officially the best burrito I've ever had, wow. Moving along, she made A LOT of suggestions as well about cool places to visit or eat in the area as I'm new to AZ, how helpful was that? I thought she was fantastic as did our entire group. Among the things we ate which were all absolutely fantastic: Veggie burrito (get it with the cheese sauce on top you'll thank me later), Fish tacos, and a few other tacos I can't remember due to margarita #2 LOL, Carne asada burrito & Quesadillas. I so wanted dessert but unfortunately I ate way too many chips/salsa, 2 margaritas, half quesadillia and almost my entire burrito (they are LARGE). This only means 1 thing of course: A) I will have to go back and check out their desserts and of course ask for Kait. Oh and Tuesdays they have $5 margaritas and $2 tacos! I hear it gets pretty busy. I honestly don't mind paying full price. I loved Joyride's vibe, employees, food, decor, margaritas, etc. Totally going back with friends/family.",

Though they weren't bad, they weren't mind blowing. I will say that they had tons of toppings which was nice. Wasn't too impressed by the side of rice as well. This seems like a good place for drinks and i really enjoyed the ambiance, not sure if I would come back for tacos.",

I felt good as soon as I walk in, the atmosphere of the restaurant was great. Very trendy, hip,  fist date, or looking for a date restaurant you won't be disappointed. The margaritas were very delicious, beers and beer glasses were cold. I couldn't wait for the food to come but that's were we ran in to some small speed bumps very little ones though. My tacos were good but the tortillas were cold I think my plate sat in the back for few minutes. The chicken burrito was very plain with no chicken in sight. Pack with very good looking vegetables but no flavor. The other three plates of food according to my family were delicious two of them were tacos and my wife ordered the chilaquiles they smell delicious, presentation was beautiful and she loved the flavor of that chilaquiles. She is very picky of margaritas drinks but she really enjoy the delicious margaritas. Please don't order the orchat drink very sweet and the glasses were packed to rim of ice. The wait staff were very friendly always checking our table to make sure were not thirsty (margaritas keep them coming) awesome job!!!!!",

They're often overwhelmed and rude because of the volume and people, and, they're are improperly making the drinks.   Joyride would benefit by designating an area for waiting customers so we're not scrambling around people sitting at the bar. It's less frustration for everyone.   This has happened on multiple occasions and nothing has improved.",

I ordered he chicken burrito, edible sure, but I wouldn't order it again.  It took a full 30 minutes after we were done eating to actually be paid and out the door. Had to ask for the check twice, waitress disappeared after she took it, and we eventually just got up and waited by the bar (we were in a regular dining booth) to finally get our cards handed back to us.  They had free chips and salsa but that was about all I liked about this place.",

The carne tacos didn't have much flavor and what flavor it did have was more of a charred flavor. Braised beef was ok, I've had better, and the pork really didn't blow me away. Everything was kind of just plopped in a tortilla with an ice cream scoop it seemed. For desert I had the vanilla pudding... which wasn't really pudding at all, seemed more like melted ice cream with some nuts Carmel and a breading thrown in.   This place I feel would do even better with some better food because I would have loved to bring the whole group of friends for a chill dinner but we're all foodies and would be a bit disappointed with the food. So many good taco places around the valley, this is a great location and building but needs some food help.",

Our small table has dishes that should have been taken up, so we had to place them on the patio partition to make room. Every cocktail that came was watered down cause of probably sitting there at the bar too long. And most of the tacos have the same boring slaw. There's numerous staff asking you if you need anything but the follow up gets lost in the chaos...and this is on a slow Monday evening! Shame cause it's a great neighborhood space but the predictable flavorless menu and slow staff definitely needs to be revamped. Too many other good street taco places in Phoenix to chose from....",

The food just tastes fine. My friends seem to love this place so I find myself here often but for the price point and taste, there are better options out there. I sure hope to find something good here soon though. I am hearing good things about the beast burrito so that may be the next thing I eat.",

My brother in-law and I threw a surprise 30th birthday for my sister here on February 8th and I couldn't be more thrilled and happy with the service I received.   I wish I could remember the gentleman's name that took care of us, but he was a rock star. We were a large party.. about 20 of us.   He had some helpers who were great as well. They were on top of things and very friendly. They looked like they loved their job and I absolutely adored that quality.   Our margaritas were great. Food was on point and they even helped me light the candles for the cake I had made.   Thank you for making my sisters night special.",

The atmosphere is a fun vibe at night with low lighting and some modern music playing at a decent volume.

Let's start with the good.... Atmosphere-great and lively Service-Taylor the bar keep as I called him was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. Very personable and was down with my silly humor.  Host that greeted and seated was awesome!  Waitress- Molly was super sweet  On to the food! We ordered a mix of tacos(carne asada, fish tacos, pork, chicken), along with an order of guacamole and elote.   Best part of our meal was the salsa/guacamole and chips other then that every single thing came out ice cold including the fish tacos (umm ewww). I was wayyy to tired to wait again for new cold food.   My kiddo says she was so disappointed as this was not the same experience she had earlier in the week.  I have to say I was too (sad face).   Based on that not sure we would drive 30 mins for a repeat. I would say if you plan on going sounds like a weekday would be your best bet!  Peace and Eats folks....",

Unfortunately that's not the experience that we had.   My wife ordered three tacos (asada, carnitas, and adobada) and she received 2 asada and 2 adobada.  The tacos were cold and not what she ordered. We asked the gentlemen who ran the food out to us for a side of salsa and it never came. We would have said something to the bartender but she wasn't very attentive. I don't think she singled us out it was the same for the other people at the bar.   I ordered the Bandit Taco Platter and it was just ok. The beans were good but the rice I couldn't even eat because it had no flavor. The carne asada was in the saltier side. This place is far from authentic.   Unfortunately I wouldn't recommend.   P.S. THEY DONT TAKE DISCOVER. WTH",

They are nice but definitely don't check in as much, it seems like they had 3 servers for the whole place while they were busy. We waited 6 minutes or so just until we were able to ask for more sauce.   The price: One word- overpriced lol. Maybe I'm too Mexican for this but 3.75-4.50 for a taco is a rip off. Only worth it to come during a happy hour special.   The food: the food is pretty good not going to lie. Definitely a twist to what tacos are actually like, but the food tasted good.

Syrup. Ambrosia, straight up nectar of the Gods. And ye be warned, they make 'em potent. Don't let that adorbs cactus glass and that beautiful fuchsia hue distract you.   Also, that second thing. Churro bites with house made chocolate dip. Because if I learned one thing from my Labor Day Weekend trip to Arizona, it was that Arizona = Churros.   There's also really cool bartenders here who think Californians are hilarious for some reason. Yes, we say hella. Yes, I did pack entirely San Francisco Giants branded items on this trip. Decor is also on point. Blown glass bottles adorn the bar area and my bestie and I were transfixed by the bulbous red lamp covering that mirrored our faces.  All in all, Joyride is an awesome stop for specialty drinks. I have never tasted anything like that before, and doubt I will again. Can't speak to the dine in options, but they looked tasty. The interactive menu that they have online is pretty sweet. Check it out!",

There are all kinds of cute seating areas, inside and out, and I think it would be really fun place to have a beer  or 12 with friends.   I'll be back, if I'm ever in Phoenix again, but only during happy hour.",

I normally don't like carne asada tacos because the meat is usually chewy but I loved theirs! Great quality beef & tender and the seasoning is delicious! After trying the standard once again to see if I liked it this time, I did not. It was cold and the meat is pulled. If the chicken was grilled and more seasoning I think I would have liked it better. Beans and rice are very good and I really liked the guacamole. Their fire roasted salsa is too spicy for my liking. The service was a lot better than last time although it was still a little slow. I'm glad I gave this place another chance!  I will definitely be back for the carne asada tacos and guacamole.",

He suggested joyride and he was handsome online so I figured what the heck. He said they were the best tacos in town and that was the only thing we agreed on all night. We arrived at our table with chips and salsa served immediately and to my pleasant surprise the chips were slightly warm and salted. The conversation was just plain salty.  I had a shrimp taco, a veggie taco (hold the shroom), and the standard. We connected immediately...tacos not my date. The chips and salsa arrived promptly, the chemistry did not. The servers work together as a team so you never feel forgotten unlike my date who forgot my name. He kept calling me bro!  One of our servers Mark was very attentive and had an infectious smile.   Joyride:1 Bumble:0  Shout out to Posy for recommending all my tacos. Couldn't be happier with her acute sense of what the customer wants.",

There are plenty of lots, but these places can get busy. There's a lot across the street near Windsor if the lots near Joyride are full.   Location: Just north of Central and Camelback - a quick walk from the light rail station at this location.  Specials: There are happy hour specials from 2-6pm with pretty good deals and $5 margaritas.   Food:  The food options are good. The guac is always delicious. The happy hour tacos are only $2 but are made with a pre-made mix. I asked for no peppers, but the server said the mix is already made.  The chips/salsa are just OK.  The salad options look pretty interesting but haven't had one before.   I ordered the Mexican corn for something new - pretty tasty!  Service:  Usually good, though I've only been here twice.   The crowd is similar to the other Upward Projects restaurant crowd.  Sign up for the Upward Projects coupons for a free app, though I'd use the coupon at Postino",

I'm a cheap date and I'm proud of it:   1 cup soup (vegetarian lentil) 1 pitcher Four Peaks session IPA 1 veggie/mushroom taco  1 fish taco (fan favorite) 1 chicken taco  1 beef taco   Grand total pre-tax and tip: $15!  The fish taco is by far the best! The vegetable one fell apart and I ended up eating it in a deconstructed manner. The flavor of the veggie taco was just ok. Making an entree out of their sides is the way to go for veggies/vegans! They really know what they're doing.   Their taco Tuesday lives on through happy hour throughout the week but is extended into dinner on Tuesday. Regardless, it's fantastic. Each of their selected tacos are $2. You get one free round of chips and salsa, but you can purchase additional for a very small fare.   I've been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. Their margaritas pack a punch. Make sure to order one of these at the beginning to drink with your chips and salsa.  The location is great! I've never had a problem with parking or too much traffic at this particular part of central phoenix. If you're bar hopping this is a great place to start to fuel up on cheap but delicious food and drink.",

Parking is much easier with the addition of the lot next to Windsor. You can also park along the street right next to Joyride if it isn't peak meal time. There's several doors around the perimeter of the building; someone will gladly point you to the host/hostess.  You can sit at a table, at the bar, or at a community table. Restaurant is large, has nice geometric patterns on the walls, and there's interesting light fixtures by the bar.  Chips and salsa: thin crispy warm chips yum, and delish spicy salsa  Cheese y mas: lots of nice fresh toppings on a bed of warm queso; simple flavor and really good  Veggie and goat cheese enchiladas: a little limited on the veggies in the enchiladas, and a lot of goat cheese so if you aren't a fan, get chicken. Also, no sides. That being said, the verde sauce is tangy and delish, and everything is well seasoned for a delightful harmony of flavors in your mouth.  The beast: made it enchiladas style with verde sauce. Delicious, tender beef and a nice mix of beans and avocado inside.  Good drink specials, as with all the Upward Projects restaurants. I can't wait to try the agua frescas and margaritas.",

Their spin on Mexican fare is pretty damned good.  Everything my friends and I had was awesome. I highly recommend the crispy fish tacos and the blood orange margarita!

Sat at the bar and was planning on having a margarita only and then moving on to another venue for dinner (Federal Pizza which is next door). The bar is situated by the open kitchen and once we saw food walking past quickly changed our plans and started ordering food. So glad we did!  Started off with the ceviche, loved every bite. Next we ordered the Lola salad, was savory and light. I was pretty full but my guest suggested we order a round of tacos. My 2 personal favs were The Standard and The Veggie (white magic is magic!)  Excellent food, impeccable atmosphere and stellar service. Highly recommend.",

I've always been impressed by the quality of this chains food (Postinos, Windsor, Federal Pizza & Churn) but this place was an absolute treat! When they brought out the salsa, I was highly impressed by the speedy service.. I ordered the nachos with carne asada and whew! I was blown away.. The abundance of avocado (I'm an avocado whore) and the tender/flavorful carne asada was out of this world. If you like spicy I highly recommend the habanero salsa (for an additional 1.99).. Yum! In honor of this review, I'm going to get some nachos now;)",

Joyride offers an impressive taco menu. I was nervous to ask if I could order sans the taco shells- oh and sans cheese- oh and gluten free. Our bartender immediately reassured me it was NO PROBLEMO at all to accommodate my needs! I had three kinds of tacos the way I wanted along with a side of fresh guacamole and cucumber+orange salad. All freshly made and full of fresh herbs and veggies. Gracias Kate and Joyride!!",

    "text": "One of my new favorite spots here in Central Phoenix.   The Space: So happy that Upward Projects has added the necessary parking lot among their complex of restaurants along central avenue. Granted there's the Valet available for Joyride but I'm sure none of the valets are enjoying parking an old 96' Geo Prizm :P There is street parking available as well for those of you not wanting to valet if the parking lot is full across the street. The overall space is fun, energetic, and retro. Beautiful geometric tile work along the walls, fun lighting fixtures above the bar and on the walls, a beautiful patio with fireplace, and a glass wall open during the winter months to create a True indoor/outdoor dining experience. Much of the inside of the restaurant is taken up by a large wrap around bar with several booths and tables set up around the perimeter.   Service: During most of my experiences I have had excellent service! Staff usually contributes to the laid-back, fun atmosphere by getting comfortable with guests at the table and engaging in conversation - not just taking our order. Every once and a while (primarily when the restaurant is slammed) service tends to lack a little - for understandable reasons.   Food and Drinks:  Most speciality cocktails are regularly priced at $9. The cocktails are generous pours and mostly tequila based. Fun cocktails including a cucumber-serano drink. Food has always been excellent! From the variety of delicious tacos to choose from to the large burritos the food has always been on point. My personal favorite is the Nachos with Chicken Tinga - certainly more food than one person needs but I can never stop myself!!   Head on over to Joyride for a fun, casual dinning experience with everything to offer: atmosphere, service, food, and drinks!",

I ordered the cucumber Serrano margarita, a chicken taco, & a fish taco which also arrived with chips and salsa.  It was all delicious.  The tacos were small but complex in flavor with layers of melt in your mouth meat, tangy sauces, and other toppings like fresh avocado.  The margaritas were a bit pricey - but had a good kick and good ice ratio.  My fiance ordered beer and they were happy to provide some beer samples.  The service was really good as well - our drinks were never empty.  I was told this location is very busy, and we arrived before 5 p.m. and the bar was full and we had to wait 5 minutes for a table.  Not a big deal, but couldn't imagine at a peak time.  Great place for tacos!",

It almost feels a bit unorganized like there are different servers for each part of the process...one person brings you water, another brings you chips, eventually someone takes your order, then someone else brings your food, and so on. The last few times I've been here, there were 5 different servers at the table but no one communicated with each other (I had to ask for water from three people before someone else brought me water). With that said, I do like it here and the food is great so I'll certainly be back.",

I've known been a total of 3 times at the time of this review and can't say there isn't anything to dislike. I had heard about Joyride more and more from friends mentioning it on their FB walls and Instagram pics and finally made it there on a weekend. The place was quite packed but not so much that we had to wait to be seated. A nice and diversified group of patrons was there (families, 20 and 30 somethings groups of friends). Great mix.I've since come back. In terms of food I can't say anything about \"The Standard\" their chicken soft taco as well as the \"Baja Fish\" (I tend to lean on the milder side of things). I've had the Mexican street corn and black beans for appetizers and they were very good. The soft tacos are delicious, the waiters great and the whole mix makes for a place that you'll want to come back to.",

    "text": "Met a friend there for an early dinner.  It is decorated beautifully.  The light fixtures are fabulous.  My friend was running late but they sat me on the patio anyway.  The server did seem a little irked that my other party was tardy.  She kept coming by a bit too frequently to ask...So I ordered 2 citrus agua frescas that were very refreshing and not too sweet.  Then feeling bad that I hadn't really ordered anything yet, I ordered some guac and chips.  It was perfectly fine guacamole....not the greatest I've had, but there are some unusually good guacamoles in this town.  There was jicama in it, which was interesting.  When friend arrived, we ordered the grilled corn or eliote with cotija cheese and paprika and a sauce called White Magic.  I think it's an amped up mayonnaise.  The corn was excellent.  Had a real grilled, slightly charred taste that I love about it.  I had a trio of tacos, one shrimp, one pibil, one braised beef.   They are the small street tacos which have become so popular.   With a trio of tacos you get a free side.  I asked the server what the beans were spiced with and she said in a kind of spaced out voice, \"I don't know....salt?\"  That made us laugh.  My friend ordered a carne asada torta and was quite pleased with it and I had the shrimp taco left to take home.  The shrimp were fresh and cooked well, the braised beef taco was awesome and the pibil was just fine.  And those beans?  Meh...I think the sever was right about the spice being salt.  The only real problem with Joyride is one wants to sit on the patio but the chairs are the most uncomfortable things I have EVER sat on in a restaurant.  I kept looking longingly  inside to see the comfy chairs those diners were sitting on.  It was a long dinner and my butt still hurt the next morning.  They are cute yellow metal things though.  But perhaps Joyride should rethink the function following form thing and invest in something a bit less torturous.  I will just know to always sit inside in the future.  They open the whole side of the restaurant so you can get tables close to the edge of the patio and have the al fresco experience.  All in all, a solid meal.  Definitely worth a return visit.",

I went here for lunch last weekend expecting mediocrity and was pleasantly surprised, but mostly by the atmosphere and decor. The food is mediocre. There are definitely better Mexican and/or Southwestern food spots in Phoenix, but the patio and location are great. Service was just okay, but that is to be expected from most places in Phoenix these days anyway. Our server was nice, but looked as if she was on her way to the YMCA to workout. Not a deal breaker, but she definitely did not dress the way I would have  expected for the decor. It just did not match and that was the first thing that I noticed. She wasn't overly friendly nor was she standoffish. She was just okay, and I got the feeling that is the standard for this restaurant. I know that this place is a part of a grouping of restaurants owned by the same people  and this is definitely one of my favorites of their pursuits. Their cocktail list was really good, and, again, the ambiance was good. Would I come back? Yes. But, probably not for a while and not until I scoured Phoenix for a better alternative. Yet, it is close to my house so they will have my business again solely because of proximity and the fact that is was average relative to other spots close to me.",

I can't say enough about how accommodating the staff was. I called a couple weeks in advance to reserve space on the patio. Even though we only were planning to have appetizers for the group, they bent over backwards to make us feel welcome. When we arrived today, our patio was rained out and they worked hard to get us a table inside. When we saw that things outside had dried out and asked to move, they cheerfully helped us get set up outside and moved all of our cups, plates, gifts, etc. for us. The food was amazing and the guests were very complimentary. I'm not sure what other people who complained about the food were ordering. I've had most of the appetizers and have sampled many of the tacos now and can say that they are all delicious. Perhaps some people have different flavor expectations and aren't ready for the unique spin on each of their dishes...but that's what I personally like about the menu. I mean, who knew almonds BELONG in chili rellenos?",

Upon existing my car I do remember saying \"ah, shit they're playing techno, do you want to go somewhere else?\" Also weary because the dirty word \"hipster\" was used to describe the place. But ALAS! The drinks were fantastic and I'm overly pleased with the beer selection. I personally got a cucumber mint tequila \"juice\" and loved it! I'm looking forward to trying out the different combinations of flavors and liquors (hey there's a logical excuse to drink more!). Food was fantastic as well. I ordered the standard the Baja fish tacos. They are served up in taco stands and I could have managed to polish off one more. The flavor combinations are classic enough to please a skeptic and creative enough to satisfy the more adventurous such as myself. The date got a chimi-style carne Asada burrito and claimed it to be the best he's had in Phoenix this far. And that says a lot, trust me. His burrito and my tacos had fresh sliced avocado to top off our foodie perfection. Even the restrooms were an aesthetically pleasing experience. Prices were reasonable, and like I said, our server and other employees eased our social anxieties and earned their 25-30% tip to boot. I will quote, \"If this is a hipster place then I guess I will join them.\"",

We brought extra money since we planned on having a few drinks (we can walk there), but didn't need it. $40 fed us both, with appetizers, dinner, drinks, and dessert. I think they have a weird wait staff situation going on, because they all seem pretty flighty, running around all nilly-willy and bothering other tables. Maybe it was just busy, but I prefer to have less people interrupting as often. My table was overly taken care of by everyone but our waitress, who disappeared as soon as we paid the check. I expected a pretentious hipster vibe, but I think they did a nice job with this place, it's more eclectic than that. There's a very peaceful feeling under the trees and in the open air. That get's lost when the chatter of nearby tables becomes yelling to hear over the music. So, if you're like me, go on an off night and sit on the patio, look into the trees, and have a relaxing dinner. It's an A-OK place to be, and sometimes that's exactly what you need. **I've removed my comments on the Cucumber Salad as they have removed the Cucumber Salad from the menu**",

Plus, valet only.. really? The food was ok. The main thing that I didn't like is you couldn't tell which hipster was your server . Confusing because they dont have any kind of uniform.  They did give us a $10.00 coupon because we had bad service. So... eh.",

The atmosphere and decor is just trying way too hard to be retro and hipster. Im pretty sure you have to have an arm sleeve or at least 4 visible tattoos and 2 facial piercings to work there, but the service was over all pretty good. Drinks were refilled very quickly and the food was brought out promptly. Although, my boyfriend and I came in on an early sunday afternoon and were sat next to a huge group of loud women getting drunk which seemed like a poor choice considering the place wasn't half full. Even the way too loud music couldnt drown out the ladies having a good ol time. The food itself was good, just not anything more than that. We got the tuna for an app and it tasted like it wasn't very good quality. The enchilada wasn't that impressive either. Not sure if we will give this place a second chance, despite hearing good things about it from coworkers.",

The size of the piece of Ahi Tuna in my taco was impressive, I'd say at least an inch in diameter. The specialty cocktails are innovative and refreshing. The decor is fun and hip and the place just has a good vibe. This is definitely a wonderful place for date night or lunch with the office crew. I will probably visit here monthly!!",

They have a variety of beers as well.   I recommend getting the guac and chips as well as picking tacos off the taco menu. Fresh and yummy. The other dishes like the quesadilla tasted good in the beginning but then my stomach really didn't feel well afterwards. Could be a fluke but be warned....

I've had the shrimp tacos twice now but don't think i'd order them again as the shrimp has been a little over cooked or rubbery but otherwise i've been happy with the food and experience here.",

    "text": "If you know me well, you know that I absolutely LOVE tacos (I mean...who doesn't?!) Joyride satisfies every facet of my love for tacos by serving up a variety of delicious gourmet tacos.  I ended up at Joyride by the recommendation of my mom and we decided to go as a family for my birthday. I thoroughly enjoyed my birthday experience. First, of all the staff was so friendly and accommodating. We had multiple servers come through to make sure we had everything we needed throughout the night.   I started the night off by ordering their Prickly Pear Margherita. It was pink and sweet with the right amount of tequila and adorned with a cute little umbrella. My boyfriend got the Pineapple Mojito which was equally tasty! Next I ordered the Mexican Street Corn appetizer. It comes on the cob with a knife to shed the kernels on your own. It was so creamy and the kernels burst with savory paprika flavor. I'm not quite sure what is in their sauce on the corn that they deem\"white magic\" but it could possibly be pixie dust filled with rainbows that make your eyes sparkle once digested.   For the main entree, I ordered the three tacos that come with your choice of a side. I went with the Carne Asada, Braised Beef, and Crispy Fish with a side of the Bomb Black Beans (great name, I love some alliteration). They all had multitudes of flavor, making each taco unique. However, my favorite was the Braised Beef. It has avocado which is always important but those gastrique onions really make the taco pop; they complemented the seasoned Braised Beef perfectly. The Bomb Black Beans speak for themselves with their name!   My boyfriend also did the 3 tacos, my dad got a burrito, and my mom has two tacos. All plates were completely cleared by the end of the meal. At the end, because it was my birthday, they brought out their Better than Betty's dessert on the house (so nice!!). I love a brownie with some ice cream and carmel sauce!! YUM.   The restaurant aesthetics are wonderful, great vibe, modern fun decor, and plenty of seating. Reservations are never a bad idea on the weekend as it gets very busy. Valet Parking is complimentary but it's always nice to leave a tip! Otherwise, the parking situation can be tough! I will be heading back soon to try more tacos!!",

I might ask if it could be extra spicy next time, but I loved the flavors of the cucumber, cilantro and pepper mixed with lime juice and Tequila. I ordered three tacos, the grilled fish, the chicken tinga, and the braised beef. For an extra dollar I added a side of black beans. The beef tacos were my favorite, just so juicy and full of flavor. Chicken tinga had great flavor but again could have kicked it up a notch on the spiciness scale for me. I added some hot sauce and it was good. Fish tasted fresh was also excellent.   Ambiance is vibrant and fun. Loud music and open floor plan. I'd love to go back at night.",

At first I tried fish tacos and veggie taco's and was not disappointed with either of them they were some of the if not the best taco's have I have. After that I can't to Joyride again on, Taco Tuesday and this time tried the beef taco's and was not disappointed. I had about 6 or seven different waiters and waitresses each of them extremely nice and checking in regularly in short, this is a place you absolutely must try.

For dinner I got the standard taco and baja fish taco. Both were amazing and I found myself wishing I had ordered a third. The corn tortillas were nice and thick and all the ingredients were really fresh and had such a nice flavor. I also loved the vibe in this place. The music selection was awesome - Beastie Boys was playing when we arrived and Cypress Hill was playing when we left. The service was great and everyone was really friendly. This was truly the perfect dining experience!",

I had the carne asada and the chicken tinga both were moist and flavorful.  Came with chips and homemade salsa. the chips were thicker than I like but held the salsa well! We also ordered the guacamole which had bites of corn in it to sweeten it a bit.  my choice of drink was the coconut and boy was it delicious! my friend had a different one and we loved them so much we had two! I also want to comment on the staff operations.  Constantly we were approached to make sure we were satisfied and not only by our regular server either which was pleasant. Someone was always checking and wiping spills and food and this was at the busiest time.   When entering we were immediately greeted with friendly smiles and even though we arrived at 450 pm there was a wait of about 15 minutes but we didn't mind that because it's always an indication of good food. One complaint is parking. It fills up fast! So get there early if possible!   The same owners as Postino, Churn, Windsor and Federal Pizza.  WHY GO ANYWHERE ELSE?",

HUGE bar area which I thought was great.   Service was really good. We had two different ladies waiting on us. They were both friendly and attentive.   Drinks and food were okay. I got the blood orange margarita. At first sip I was like \"Wow this is great!\" After a few more, it started to get SO sweet. I could barely finish it. I ordered the crispy fish, shrimp and ahi tacos. The crispy fish was actually really good but the other two were rather bland. The ahi was dry. I got black beans as a side and they were also very bland (I added some salt myself.).   They give you complimentary chips and salsa in the beginning but it's a fire roasted salsa. If you want any other kind besides fire roasted you have to pay.   Also, I wish they had a couple tvs at the bar area. We wanted to meet up with some friends to watch the USA soccer game and would have stayed here, but ended up going to a different restaurant to watch it since Joyride didn't have any tvs.  I will probably return to give this place another chance and maybe try some different things. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars but the food just didn't knock my socks off.",

The bench seat, means we get to sit close. I love that. Well done.  Joyride is part of the Federal Pizza, Postino, Windsor, Churn owners that are branching into Mexican food.   Tonight I started with a Green Flash Summer Saison bomber, $12. Brewed in California, a 4.5% True to style, Saison. French farmers would serve their workers this style, hence the low alcohol level. I love the unfiltered, rustic nature, damn good! My babes got a margarita $9  Next came chips and a green salsa. I enjoy these like I haven't eaten in days, so good. Our entree was the roasted chicken burrito. Absolutely superb.",

Then of course after that, we had multiple servers coming up asking if we had been helped yet... I think it's because they pool tips and don't have table sections... They all are either redundant or no where to be found.  Second time I went it was one of the strangest experiences I've ever had... Ever.  We were asked THREE times by multiple servers if we had a safe way to get home,but instead of them asking it that way, they gave us long dance-around-the-issue schpeels about the community and how they want to keep it safe. We told em we were light railing home and lived down the street.... they were obviously worried about us drinking and driving. Even after that, thy still failed to being us our last round... Without actually telling us they were cutting us off. We each had three drinks and dinner and had been there for three hours. Then we had to get up and ask for the bill TWICE because no one ever came back to our table after three of them had bomboarded us with questions at separate times.",

As Im sure you can tell by my stars they never returned my email so I called today and guess who is now all booked up and can not make another reservation. Now, I can come and wait probably 2 hours according to the manager I spoke with. To bad, we come here every year for the tournament guess a yearly 20-50 people party doesnt interest them.

I loved those tacos so much I NEVER ordered anything else. My second favorite thing was your pinto beans. Whole pinto beans that taste like refried beans. We both equally love your chip salsa.  So imagine our DISAPPOINTMENT. Its 105 degrees outside. Inside it's comfortable but EVERY door in the restaurant is OPEN. There are no blowers on the doors so we are immediately swatting flies. Once the chips and salsa arrive it becomes a battle. It takes ten minutes to get the ice tea and we were never offered a refill thru the entire meal. Once the food arrives it becomes a take a bite of food and then swipe a fly ritual. My shrimp tacos are so over cooked even I notice. Trust me it takes a lot for me to not like any shrimp. As for my wife's tortilla soup, it isn't on the menu. My whole pinto beans are dry and taste like they just came out of a jar with a bunch of salt dumped on them. Last but not least. If you want a refill on the SMALL bowl of salsa and chips it'll cost you two bucks! We will not be returning. Best guess as to the \"fall\" of Joy Ride. New owners/management? They lost the original chef? We still don't get the \"every door in the place OPEN\". So, so sad.",
