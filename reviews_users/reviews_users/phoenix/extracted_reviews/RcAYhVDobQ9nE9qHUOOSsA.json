I would say very standard nothing out of the ordinary. Burger made to order wish I realized I could have got avacado that would have rocked. I think I probably prefer smash and my favorite in out. If you like those you will like this place. My experience here was 5 stars just that if I give innout a five and smash a four this would be a three. Mainly based on the fact it is just a greasy burger. If you like your burger juicy with lots of fat this is for you. I just prefer something less greasy. That being said this place is very good",

    "text": "Saw this place in the Yelp email.  Needed to take my son to Toys R Us to use a gift card and it occurred to me that Habit Burger was right there, so I suggested we have lunch there rather than the usual McD's.  I temped him with the offer of a chocolate shake.  I was amazed with the cleanliness and brightness of this place.  There was a line when we got there, but it moved quickly.  The tables were packed but we managed to snag a 2-top pretty soon after getting in line.  My son had the kids grilled cheese meal (something you don't find at your standard fast food place) and I had a charburger.  We shared his fries and the shake.  OMG - the burger was heavenly!  The roll gets a little grill to it so it has a little crunch on the inside.  It was not greasy at all, just tasty and soooo good!  The fries were equally ungreasy and good - crunchy too.  The chocolate shake - my son only had about 3 sips which left me to drink the rest of it (dang it) - was absolutely delish.  And the prices were outstanding!  Its a good thing there isn't a Habit Burger closer to my house.  I'd eat there all the time!  Five Guys?  Forget em!!!",

The burger was awesome. Cooked perfectly. I just wish they were larger. There're so small all of the time that it makes me sad. While they're tasty, they were not much larger than silver dollar pancackes. The sweet potato fries were almost two dollars while normal potato fries were half that price.

    "text": "I had seen the menu for this place laying around at work and I had assumed that it wouldn't be very good because $2.95 for a hamburger?  Those are fast food prices!  They can't be good quality for that!  My co-workers assured me I was wrong but I took my time checking the place out.  That finally changed today when I decided I was bored of every other place I normally go to for lunch and a burger sounded good.  I walked in and was greeted right away (eye contact, smile, everything!).  The girl who helped me was friendly and patient as I took my time ordering since I hadn't been there before.  I ordered the Double Char with cheese and a side of fries to go.  As I was waiting I was happy to see some of the employees going around and wiping counters, sweeping the floors, just doing general cleaning which made me happy because a clean place that serves food is a great place!  My buzzer letting me know my food was ready went off pretty quickly but not so fast that I felt like they just grabbed my burger out from under a heat lamp.  The man who gave me my food (possibly the manager) made sure to relay my order back to me to make sure it was correct and offered packets of ketchup for my fries.  He made eye contact the whole time and was also very friendly.  Once I had my bag of goods I couldn't resist reaching in for a fry (or possibly two....) right away.  They were hot, fresh and perfectly cooked!  A nice crunch on the outside but still soft on the outside and the perfect amount of salt.  Once I bit into my burger I was equally impressed.  The meat was cooked about medium so nice and juicy, the cheese was oozing off the sides and the veggies were fresh and perfectly portioned to the burger.  I'm only a little ashamed to admit that I actually finished the whole thing (which is why my next stop after finishing this review is going to be the gym...) because it was so delicious.  I will definitely be making The Habit one of my habits!  Hehe I made a pun!",

It seemed so affordable but I ended up paying more then I meant to. Things just added up quickly....  As far as the burger it was pretty good. I am not entirely sure what was on the charburger but I enjoyed it.  It had mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion on it. I guess the nice flavor was the combo of the grill and the fact that the onions are caramelized (according to the online website I just looked at). The sweet potato fries were awesome and nice to have with a fast food burger.  I think now that I know the prices I won't be so unpleasantly surprised by the price when I go next time.",

I have been curious to try Habit, having made a tour of the other newish burger joints - Smashburger, Culvers, 5 Guys, etc.  The restaurant itself is stylish and clean, so I liked that.  You order at the counter and get your food when it's ready.  The burger was ok, nothing special at all.  The fries were good, and the side salad came with a really delicious balsamic vinaigrette, a dressing I've tired of but decided to try here and really liked it.    The manager stopped by our table which was nice.  The menu has other interesting options that we didn't try (tuna steak sandwich, chicken, veggie burger, etc).   My 3 star rating is due to the salad, the cleanliness of the restaurant and the attentiveness of the manager.  Otherwise I would have given a 2 star rating due to the very high prices for what you get.   Sorry Habit, for a burger I would go elsewhere.",

Toasted bun, less than 1/4 patty (so if you are a big eater, get the double), lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions, pickles and mayo.  This is a pretty good combo as it comes but I added mustard (I like it spicy) and cheese (extra fat = extra taste).  I'm not a huge eater and this one patty was more than enough, especially since I ordered fries.   Fries are good - good size in fry length and quantity.  They do offer sweet potato fries but I have not tried them yet.  They offer a chicken, fish and meatless option as well.  If they had a drive-thru I would probably be here more often!! (hint)",

I was a fan in the past but I will say I wasn't a fan of this burger. I love sourdough bread but this was very dry. The whole sandwich was dry and they cut the meat then grilled it which dried it out too. I thought they had fallen from grace. So I had to go back and give them one more try since I was such a fan in the past. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. Sure enough I did. When I went back I just ordered the regular Double Char with Swiss cheese and everything on it. It was as good as I remember. Whew. I was worried there for a second. It was nice and big and juicy and also cheaper then I remembered. $5 for a double burger that is a lot bigger than other places burgers that are more then $5. What a deal. I am a fan once again and will probably become a regular once again too. I am sorry I ever left. Btw the fries and onion rings are awesome too.",

It was very bizarre. There were plenty of employees to wipe down tables so more people could sit down at a clean one.   The bathroom was also very gross.

    "text": "Our New Years day lunch was pretty good at Habit Burger. The BF got the double char burger and I had the swiss and mushroom burger and we shared some onion rings and sweet potato fries.  The food was pretty good. I think it was a tad overpriced being that it wasn't anything fabulous but it was still good. They have a small self serve jalapeno and chili pepper station to spice yup you sandwiches. They also offer some bbq sauces, ketchup, and malt vinegar (which I love, btw). The sweet potato fries were slightly overcooked but the onion rings were really good. I hate when onion rings are loaded with breading and these ones weren't. The burgers themselves were pretty tasty but, like I said, nothing amazing, but not bad either.   The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. The staff was friendly and the manager walked around asking how everyone's lunch was.  Overall it was good. Would we come back? Sure!",

Stick with what you know like the old standbys, Red Robin or Carl's Jr. Instead, I visited the Habit Burger Grill based on the many glowing reviews. Bad idea.   The Habit featured loud Tinfoil and trip hop tracks blasting on strategically-placed speakers that prevented any escape regardless of your seating. Immediate turnoff. It seemed like an obvious attempt to pander to a younger crowd, a sure signal of a lame attempt to cover up mediocre cuisine. In this case, that's exactly what it was.  Older, well-traveled burger connoisseurs like ourselves are not fooled. I remember the days of mom and pop char joints in  southern California that will never be equaled in my opinion. Indeed, the fare was unimpressive, tasteless, and nothing special. The \"Meh, I've had better\" category expresses our reaction perfectly. The onion rings were grocery store frozen and way too salty, not fresh at all. I had the mushroom double char, and unlike similar fare from Carl's Jr. could not taste the mushrooms in the burger (they were there).   Next time, I'll stick with the tried and True for something as standard as char-broiled burgers. Better than In N Out? Don't think so. Pass.",

I used to think they were a bit greasy but I have found that if you get them without the grilled onions this is not the case. And I did a comparison of the calories and fat contents of other nearby fast food burger places and they are pretty good in that department. Their burgers are a great portion size but if you do have a bigger appetite you can always order a double. They don't offer gluten free buns but I recently tried the lettuce wrapped option and it was actually really good. They used huge leaves of very fresh and crisp iceberg lettuce. Someone really took the time to wrap it carefully because it didn't fall apart or get messy either. So that was pretty cool. The only thing keeping them from 5 stars at this point is that I wish they would offer real cheddar cheese instead of processed \"American\" cheese.",

    "text": "Put me on the list as the newest fan of the The Habit Burger Grill!  I've had more than a fair amount of experience eating burgers all over our great county and some of the best have been in small diners or local hole-n-the-wall joints specific to that area.  I've pounded down the burgers at the chain restaurants as well as national & regional fast food places but The Habit Burger Grill has set a hell of a bar that'll be hard to beat now.     Quick note of how my family & I ended up here;  After a long two days at the ball fields and shopping, it was time for a hearty sit down dinner, we were tired of fast food, and I was hungering for a large steak but every place we went to had a 20 to 45 minute wait onna Tuesday night?!  The hole in my gut, negative blood sugar level, mouth watering aroma of steak was causing a tremendous rage to build by the time we had left the 3rd steak place, the Longhorn and I was thoroughly pissed off.  My wife pointed at the brightly lit Habit Burger Grill and suggested we try it and I was no mood to drive around looking for a another place.  The front was busy but service was quick and the staff was friendly efficient.  I ordered the double char burger, onion rings, fries and chocolate malts while my wife, not the biggest burger fan in the world mind you, picked the Santa Barbara and fried green beans.  I was not too keen on the size of the patties when the food arrived but the flavor and freshness of the meat, vegetables, sauce and seared bun more than amazed me.  The crispness of the fries,onion rings and green beans were a delight with no heavy grease flavors.  The avocado slices on the Santa Barbara burger were perfect & enhanced the overall flavor which was evident as my wife only grudgingly gave me a bite and finished  hers which she normally does not do with burgers.    The chocolate malts were delicious and my daughter, normally a Culvers custard fan, said she's found a new favorite.  Long winded but wanted to rely what a treat it was to discover this burger grill and all you folks that are blase about the place because you HAVE the choice of Smash, 5 Guys (bleecch), In-N-Out, Whattaburger etc on a weekly/monthly basis,  maybe you ought to refrain for a while and try again.   I'll bet you'll have a change of opinion..",

Food is either cold or order is incorrect.  Today my biggest issues were food and customer service.  I had the golden chicken sandwich and it was overcooked and dry.  All of our fries were cold and looked like they were old and tossed back into the fryer.  I didn't bother to mention anything to anyone because nobody seemed engaged with the customers.  I will stick to the other locations.  This was after 3pm so it was 4 of us and 2-3 others, so no excuse in trying to cut corners or tame a rush.",

Inside it looks like fast food a counter, menu above condiment station and tables, But here you get a pager Vs a call, and the prices are a bit higher.   I had a albacore tuna sandwich, $5.75 a thin slab of tuna on a huge bun with tons of tartar sauce and lettuce.  It was not bad but I like fish and don't need to only taste the sauce.   For a side I had the onion rings $1.95 they were not special at all with a breadcrumb type coating and thin onions inside.   Overall I was unimpressed and the vlaue was not quiet there.",

Their veggie burger comes super vegetabled-out with sprouts and cucumbers even as a vegetarian I'm not that big of a fan of cucumbers and sprouts on a burger so I got it with cheese and left off the previously mentioned.  It was pretty dry and over cooked as veggie burgers go with nothing special going on.  If restaurant  is going to have one on the menu at least try to make it better than the freezer section ones.  They must be doing well though I had to wait a really long time for my food even on off hours.  They were busy but they didn't seem slammed for the wait I had.  The onion rings were kinda greasy and the breading was falling off so the main reason I came was a bummer as well.  They might be good for the carnivores, but I would skip it if you are a vegetarian and want a burger fix.",

So a couple immediate observations...  About price.  I can get the same meal at In and Out for at least $2 cheaper.  I can get a far larger burger at Fudruckers for the same price.  So now about quality.  For less money the In and Out burger is far better quality.  For the same amount of money the Fudruckers is far better quality.  None of the above is to say that the burger here was bad.  Rather, you can get better quality for less or the same elsewhere.  The only thing unique here is how they cook the hamburger.  But it isn't worth the extra $$ over In and Out and doesn't even approach the higher quality bar set by Fudruckers for the same price.  So at the end of the day I'm left trying to figure out what's the big deal is about this place.  Beats the heck out of me.",

    "text": "\"Hamburgers, the cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.\"  I could spout off Pulp Fiction quotes all day, but I'm not reviewing Pulp Fiction.  Suffice it to say, I'm a fan of hamburgers and a fan of the fast-casual burger joint trend that is sweeping the Valley.  Habit Burger fits right into that mold.  No drive-thru, but no waiters, and very cheap prices.  (Burgers start at $3.)  Habit goes with the model of using thin beef patties that you can double up.  This leads to a less juicy product, but it also leads to In & Out Burger comparisons, and that's a tough standard to compete with.  In & Out is even cheaper and carries the nostalgia factor.  The major difference between the two burgers is that In & Out burgers come with \"secret\" ketchup-mayonaise and Habit Burger uses only mayo.  Habit Burger does offer variety though.  They have solid versions of fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings.  They have sandwiches of chicken, tri-tip or even grilled tuna.  I actually tried their chicken salad once, which was... fine, I guess?  Chicken over lettuce and a few vegetables.  Boring, meets healthy, meets airplane dinner presentation.  There are other perks.  I really liked the chocolate milkshake there.  It was honestly one of the best milkshakes I've ever had.  The jalapeno and pepperoccini bar is a nice touch.  However, I think Habit Burger may be stuck in burger purgatory... or Burgatory, if you will.  (Boo!  I now hate myself.)  For cheap burgers, go to In & Out.  For a better and slightly more expensive carnivorous experience, you're safer with Fatburger or Five Guys.",

It has a diner-like feel but it wasn't objectionable.  You order at the front counter and then the food is delivered a short while later. The burgers were good enough and tasty and came with a decent amount of condiments and toppings such as lettuce, tomato and grilled onions.  I did think that the patties were a tad on the small side considering the price.  The sweet potato fries were rather tasteless and needed more flavor.  Some of my friends had the shakes and said that they were really good although I didn't try one.  I would give The Habit another try.  It surely was good enough.",

Also, the staff (since the manager or owner was not there) was chatting up a storm about dating from what I could hear and were not truly paying attention to the customers.  This location was empty when I visited and I see why.

The tables are all sticky, food crumbs all over the table tops and booths. Place isn't busy at all. If I didn't love the burgers so much I'd stop eating at this establishment because I hate always having to clean off my own table with napkins. Burger bun was a little crispy this time which made the burger fall apart after 2 bites into it. Other than the over toasted burger bun and messy tables, food was good.",

I love The Habits food, especially their salads. So I went in, ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad. Simple enough. She asked me if I wanted everything on it, I said yes. It took a little long in my opinion but nothing outrageous. The guy buzzed my buzzer, grabbed my bag and left.   Got home, opened my salad. No dressing...zero. Its usually mixed in the salad by them. I figured, maybe they put it on the side, fine. Nope, no dressing at all in the entire bag. Checked my fridge, we don't even have dressing to put on it!! So I have dry lettuce, chicken, and croutons. So disappointed.  I decide to call the store to ask for a refund. But no, you can't call a specific Habit, they have a call center. The call center said that they couldn't issue refunds. They said I needed to fill out an online request form if I wanted anything. So I did. I filled out this entire form. Went to submit it....the website is filled with errors. It wouldn't let me submit the form because I hadn't filled out the stores street address, which would have been away to fix, except for the fact that I did write it in the box, retried several times with no luck.   Called the call center back, the guy took my number down and said management would call me tomorrow before noon.  No salad dressing...no money...no dinner  Thanks Habit!!",

My only gripe with this place is that it is consistently not as clean as the Guadalupe location.   My favorite part about going to the Guadalupe location in the past was because an employee named Cheyenne (sp?) was always such an absolute sweetheart. You can imagine how I felt when she ended up moving to this location a little after!  The menu here varies not only in types of food, but prices as well. I always suggest people to just get the number one or two and to take note it is a suggestion by the company itself. -The price is literally the sum of the a la carte items included in the combo-. Some people are kind of put off by this, but it also favors substituting items. I usually get a regular char burger no cheese or mayo and a side salad. I'm not missing out on any savings, so I don't feel punished for eating healthier.   If you just take things slow and simple here, you won't really be disappointed.",

The bite has everything you could ask for salty sweet in the meet. As they say the patties do not appear to be that large for the price but the flavor is there.   I asked for extra pickles and retrieve the peppers on the side myself for a little kick.  I also got a side of onion rings which were crunchy sweet and come with a side of ranch.  I do not know if it could replace an in and out burger animal style but I would return.",

    "text": "Hey man, you know I'm really okay The burger in my belly will tell you same And when I review I won't give it crap Cause The Habit's burger got me smiling and full!  I guess I go to the Habit And eating away Gotta go to the Habit And eating way Yeah Yeah! (Lyrics - Offspring - Bad Habit)  The Habit Burger first started out in the beach fronts of Santa Barbara and soon became a popular local burger joint.  I could see why.  Fresh cut vegetables and charbroiled beef patties on an open flame would drive anyone towards this place; I guess you can call it a habit we all have - wink!    I ordered the Double Charburger, with tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, cheese, and toasted bun.  Needless to say sounds pretty basic, but once you sink your teeth into the warm bun and through the sides; you can taste the nice thin crust created from the charred grill while the beef has that perfect moisture.  The cheese adds that extra ooze of salt and savory.  Add a side of onion rings or fries and we're golden!  I generally don't rave too much about chain restaurants, but I must approve the Habit Burger for bringing out the \"Bad Habit\" of mines; eating a yummy burger!  Sorry love handles!   One of the things I noticed about the Habit Burger Grill is their service.  They are on top of it and know how to sell their menu.  You would order like any other fast food joint, but they seem more passionate and knowledgeable of what they do.  I had a few questions on my first visit and they were all answered.  The server and table attendants were super courteous and friendly.  I appreciate good service since it seem like a dying art, but I make sure to point it out when ever I get a chance.  The Habit has a slight beach flare feel, but definitely a modern diner.  Order at the counter and pick a seat, while extra condiments; peppercini peppers, jalapenos, and pickles are readily available at your own risk haha!  I would recommend The Habit Burger Grill to you and see what the people of Santa Barbara of been raving about for years. - Enjoy!",

They give you a buzzer  to notify you once you're food is ready. It's like any other burger joint and I wouldn't say the food is bad or spectacular. The reason for the 3 stars is the service. The person who took my order was being rude and the day had barely started. Tried to be cheerful with her and she was not having it. She was speaking fast and I couldn't understand what she asked and asked her what she said. She responded with an attitude in her tone. My friends said the same thing about their behavior. What separates this place from good burger places? The SERVICE! The Manager was behind the cashiers and didn't seem to mind their behavior. Go to In and Out down the street.

I had the veggie burger on wheat, which was not even remotely dry (wow!) and the avocado made it more excellent. My friend had the Albacore sandwich (not breaded-yay!), which was firm, juicy and not fishy!  My daughter had the Chicken Cobb salad which was a nice size (not huge, not tiny) and the chicken was REALLY juicy also. My son had a double cheeseburger which tasted just like a fresh burger should taste. Moist but not too greasy. The bun was SUPER soft. Go for the sweet potato fries.  Also, All the nutritional info is on their website. The tuna sandwich is only 390 and the veggie burger is 470. We'll be back.",

Maybe they are having some start up issues which explains the luke warm fries. The burger, however, is anything but habit forming. The beef was tasteless and didn't have a chance against the strange sauce that oozed from my sandwich. The lettuce was shredded to a point where I thought maybe it was meant as food for small reptiles. I'm sure some folks will make it a Habit. For me taste is most important which is why I will cross over the freeway and hit 5 Guys. Better burgers and better fries period.",

The lady asked the cooks to fix it and they simple wiped off the onions and I watched them do it. Not the best service or food, but decent.

This place has some big issues with food quality control!! Management needs to really get this place   7/22 Update after my review someone from corporate reached out. They apologized  for the quality of food and service we received. We also received a letter of apology from them as well with a few vouchers to make up for the money we wasted. I did not expect this at all and it was a nice gesture. Thank you for taking accountability and caring!!",

    "text": "This is the second time I am going to this place and I kind of like the burgers here. This is a fast food place and the place was popping with people when we went for a Friday lunch.  There was a line to order and it moved pretty quick. We hardly had place to sit with so many people. I have tried their grilled chicken burger and the veggie burger with side of fries and onion rings.  The grilled chicken burger is really good and the chicken is juicy, crisp on the outside with onions, tomatoes, cheese, totally yummy. Veggie burger is pretty big and I like how they have tried to make it vegan if you like but I went with cheese and avocado for some extra money. Also, noticed u could do Keto with lettuce wrap and go without the buns.  Fries they offer is a lot but their onion rings is the winner, its crunch and so good, its one of the best rings I have had. I wouldn't go with the veggie burger again though, it tasted alright for me. The price is definitely a little more, veggie burger with avocado and onion rings costed me $11. I liked this place and could go once in a while.",

    "text": "The Habit Burger Grill is an American fast casual restaurant chain that specializes in charbroiled hamburgers. The company also purveys other typical fast-casual fare. The place was busy and surprisingly clean with very friendly service.   Great burger, great onion rings! You can't beat flame grilled. You order when you walk in, take a buzzer, and go get your foid fromt he counter when it buzzes. Get your own soda at the fountain. Super easy and laid back. Love it.  The restaurant is open from 1030 am to 10 pm serving char-burgers with sides, signature sandwiches, fresh salads, kids' favorites, hand-made frozen treats and drinks. The food is delicious and the place is bright and neat with on-going happy music and seemingly popular with clients. There are indoor and outdoor seating arrangements with enjoyable sceneries. Accessibility conveniences are available to adults and children and to those who use wheel chair.",

This was a bonus because the location in Tucson always is busy. The staff at the registers were super friendly and even offered suggestions to my friend and her kids as they've never been.  The food was ready in no time at all.  The restaurant was clean. The food did not disappoint. The burger was perfect the bun was perfect the fries were amazing and crispy.  I was very happy that we stopped here for dinner.  If you're looking for something fast food that tastes better than fast food... I would recommend this burger place.",

We chose to try their signature cheeseburgers and fries. So delicious. The freshest ingredients. Cooked to order. Tasty, hot fries. The establishment was very clean, obviously well managed. The staff was very friendly. As it was our first visit they guided us a bit through the menu and made a few suggestions when asked. Couldn't have asked for more.  Perfect lunch. Can't recommend it high enough. If you're in this area of Chandler and looking for a great burger meal you will never do better than this location of Habit Burger",

That said, their fries and onion rings were good. Next time I want to try the tri-tip sandwich and others in my house want to try the albacore tuna. Others have raved about those.   Of course, this is a fast food place (but it is not fast, everything is made to order), so the decor reflects that. No points off for that since it is exactly what you would expect. Service was good.   In all, a decent place and a good addition to the neighborhood. Maybe I can bump it up a star after I try the tri-tip.",

Not a big fan of beef so I liked the size. I forgot to mention - all this wrapped up nicely on a sesame seed bun.   The photos of Santa Barbara hanging on the wall threw me off... but after a quick Google search I realized this place isn't a new kid on the block and just some corporate chain. It has a cool story and brothers bought out a burger joint in 1969 in Santa Barbara (obbbbviously) and have recently branched out. Very fresh ingredients....will definitely be back.",

A completely different beast than that of the In N Out variety. Less greasy than In N Out, I would say slightly tastier than In N Out, but as claimed a completely different beast. Habit has a way of pairing up their burgars with their interestingly yummy fries, sweet potato fries, & motherfuckin' onion rings!  Onion Rings!!!!! Holy mother of all that is sweet, crispy, & tasty. This is what you do, if you're a fat as fatass like me, order a Double CharCheez & a side of onion rings, open your burgar, stuff desired amount of onion rings (all of them if you're fat as fatass like me), & reassemble to your liking, add sauces if you wish (I care not much for sauces but sometimes it does not hurt), and then take a bite of your Double CharOnionRingCheez burgar! Heaven. Not so sure about their shakes but one of these days i'm going to have to try one.  I know this is the one for AZ but this is the place where i first tried The Habit, so dont knock me chumps!",

    "text": "Ok so again I have been hearing all the rave about The Habit Burger, a California burger joint to hit the Valley, was told it is better than IN-N-OUT, man do I love my animal style! Oh anyways back to the Habit, The joint itself is a cute little place, clean and the staff is friendly, the menu, someone simple, a few burgers to choose from, some sandwiches, fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings and I'm sure I'm missing something but oh well you get the point. Ok I ordered the Teriyaki Charburger with swiss cheese, I am a huge lover of teriyaki burgers, let's just say I was sadly disappointed. The burger was bland, lacking in flavor, my taste buds were expecting to be hit with the sweet pineapple and tangy sauce, but was left with everything tasting like it was washed in water, the pineapple, grilled onions, tomato, cheese and lettuce just was all mush, so sad.  The sauce was watery and just dripping out of the sandwich, and not watery in a finger lickin good way, like the sauce whatever it was, was watered down to last longer.   I ordered French fries, which I was told after I ordered I should have ordered the onion rings, but hey fries are fries right?  Sadly no, they were fried good, but lacking in flavor, like maybe The Habit is scared to add salt or even pepper, the hamburger patty could have benefited from a hit a or 2 too! And I don't even like salt or cook with salt.    But the Onion rings I did try and they are pretty damn sweet, but that's not enough to warrant another trip for me. I asked for a side of ranch dressing, thinking sweet!! love fries with some ranch, again hit with sadness, the ranch dressing has suffered the same watered down effect and just runs off your fries, didn't even try to stick around :o( Ok not everything is bad, on their sidebar you can get those hot little yellow peppers , jalapenos, and pepperoncinis, so the side of me that craves the burn of spicy food, got all happy!!! Those little yellow peppers didn't disappoint!  I really did want to like the Habit Burger, but it just didn't happen.  I do wish Yelp would come out with  1/2 stars cuz then my rating would be a 2  1/2 Stars.",

The habit gives you little flavor or anything out of the ordinary to form a habit. I give the location three stars for the kindness of their staff, good music and a little different flavor. I was not blown away as I thought maybe I would be but then again I think the person who recommended it to me is new to chargrilled burgers.

I saw a lot of bodies but only 1 girl on a register at a time. at one point I saw the cashier training another employee.... you would think the manager would have opened up another register instead of letting the line get 3,4 people waiting.  Food was excellent as always.  Thanks Habit",

I always get the charburger with cheese and it is probably one of the burgers I have had in Arizona, at least top 5. And their onion rings, are simply fantastic, i gotta say the meal is not complete without a side onion rings and french fries (which are also pretty tasty). But the one thing that really makes this burger joint worth checking out: their ranch. Apparently they make the ranch in house and it is amazing.",

To me, at a minimum, a restaurant should have all of their menu items in stock at all times.  I won't go back, there are plenty of other burger places that also provide good customer service.",

The fries were simply average, but I also got some onion rings and they were fantastic.  Too much food, obviously, but I wanted to try them both.  Next time I'll go with the burger and onion rings.  Prices are reasonable for what you'd expect at a fast casual type of place.  Staff was friendly.  Be ready to wait, however.  There was only one order in front of mine and by the time I got my order it was almost 15 minutes.  As long as you know you will wait a bit, it's worth it.  I'll definitely go again - just wish there were one closer to my house.",

I explained to him a party of 8 in front of me got their burgers and a party behind me in line had already got their burgers. He again snapped at me and said the buzzed would go off when my order was ready. I advised him I didn't like how he was talking to me and he raises his voice and says if I don't stop yelling he would kick me out of the store. I was having a normal conversation and he made up this lie to bully me. I asked for the name of his boss and he refused to give it to me. I'm a retired cop and have never been so disrespected by anyone in the service industry, especially a manager. Because of how I was treated by this manager I will never go to another Habit Burger again and you shouldn't either.",

I would let some dirty tables slide in the middle of a busy shift, but we're talking at 10:30am (right when they open) on a Saturday. It's very obvious the Friday night crew just walks out the door and locks up without cleaning anything, and then the Saturday morning crew comes in and says \"well if they aren't cleaning, why should we have to do it?\" Dirty tables, trash under tables, greasy/sticky floors (the \"wet floors\" signs they have out make me laugh because it's so obvious these floors haven't been wet in weeks), a mess of trash & crumbs on top of the garbage receptacles....I could go on and on. I've visited at opening on a Saturday about 3 times in the past six months and it's always like this, so I'm done trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. (Oh yeah, I'm pretty sure the same greasy handprints have been on the windows every time I visit, too.)",
