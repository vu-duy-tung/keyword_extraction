It's good for the craving and it's better than lots of other places around here in Phoenix. I gave 4 stars because the food is average (if you've had Cali places before) but I gave the extra star because the service is a plus! They're really friendly and are attentive to you. I'll go again, it's probably the best I can get while out here in Phoenix.",

My gf tried the pho...well....nothing special but seem like the same old pho compared to other established pho places. Also their appetizers...I tried their pork sausage rolls....well they were okay.  Overall good service and fair price.G approved!",

I went there twice, the first time, my impression was OK pho as I was with a group of friend and didn't pay as much attention. 2nd time... went there after grocery in Mekong and paid a bit more attention to the food .... honestly, it's really just a OK, or can I say OK-minus  If you were in the area and looking for good pho, I would recommend to go across the street to Blue-Moon. Much cheaper (like $5-6 vs $8+) .. i know we are talking about 2 bucks .... but hey that's like 40%, and the quality is much better...   But if you were really craving for pho and can't just wait to cross the street, this is a OK place.",

I recently had to make some changes to my dietary habits and tried their vegetarian pho for the first time today - absolutely delicious, super-flavorful, and loaded to the brim with crisp veggies. If you're a vegetarian and looking for a yummy vegan pho, check 'er out. If you're NOT a vegetarian, try the pho tai (rare slices of steak). Egg rolls and rice paper spring rolls are also tasty times, indeed!",

The food was wonderful I had a 41, wife was like a 38 or something and son got a 14.  she then taught us the proper way to prepare to our taste each thing we ordered and how to eat them.  We shared around the table what we each got and all of it was great.  Oh don't forget to get the coffee if your a coffee lover its almost like having a nice little dessert drink with your meal..

    "text": "Wonderful establishment. Great food, great authentic Vietnamese soft-drinks and deserts. And most of all, incredibly friendly, outgoing staff. In contrast to almost every other genuinely ethnic Asian restaurant, these people understand that a lot of white people are a little uncertain or inexperienced when it comes to Asian food. They guide you through the menu, answer all of your questions, and are very attentive and friendly. Wow, what a contrast to most Asian places I've been to! And because of this great service they have a huge non-Asian following. What a smart business model! The food is excellent: the rice noodle bowls, Pho (Vientamese beef or chicken soups), and fried rice dishes. They have great appetizers and one of the absolute best soft drinks which is an authentic beverage made of soda water, lime juice, ice and simple syrup. In just the right proportions, this drink is heaven. The bottom line, if you're one of those people who is curious about trying Vietnamese food, but feel a little awkward or intimidated, this is the place for you! In contrast, if you're an old hand who's powered through hundreds of noodle bowls, can pronounce all the dishes in their mother tongue, and are deft enough to catch flies with chop-sticks, this is still the place for you!!!",

If you are wanting to try someplace new or you are a pho pro, this place is for you. I absolutely love pho!. Everywhere I go I look to yelp to lead me to my delicious bowl of pho. The pho here is some of the best I  ever slurped. It savory and tasty. Plenty of fixings to mix in.  They staff is always awesome. The place is clean and tidy. Bonuses for being attached to the Mekong plaza. Great shopping for Asian goodies. Be sure to stop at the Vietnamese bakery on the way out and grab some almond crunch. This is a must go if you are a foodie in Arizona. I would write more but my pho is here!",

They have all your typical pho soups for about $9/bowl, but they also have more unusual types from different parts of Vietnam which I appreciate and have not been brave enough to try. I like to stick to my brisket and tendon pho and fresh spring rolls... but I'll be a bit more adventurous soon :)",

Interestingly. when I first tasted the broth I felt it was ok. It didn't have the depth of the best of broths it town, but it had a flavor that was pleasant at first. I thought was better than some of the bland offerings around the valley. However, by the end of the meal, I would have preferred one of the more bland offerings. Imagine listening to the same musical note over, and over, and over, and over again. Silence is much better. That was how I felt about this broth. The same darn note over and over again. I did what I never do and started doctoring the bowl with sriracha, hoisin, salt, and by the end I even tried sugar.  On a side note, I had the spring rolls which were the worst I've had in town. The spring roll itself was flavorless and the sauce literally tasted like melted Skippy peanut butter, While I enjoy melted peanut butter on a toasted bagel, it's not exactly what you want as a complement in your Asian meal.",

Once again, while they added some cilantro, I like my own sprigs so I can go CRAZY with the greenery. The place is clean, inside Maekong Market, so you have to deal with the lookers and the noise/parking issues. I think if I had to order out my last pho meal, I would go with Da Vang, Pho Thahn, or even Nam Sau in Glendale. It wasn't perfect, but it was un-pho-gettable. Worth going for the name, really.

Not like I get around the planet much or anything, but I grew up in the San Gabriel Valley area of Los Angeles, and had plenty of pho choices growing up and when I go home to visit. The broth is the most pleasant I have ever had, for those who know Golden Deli in California, I would even say unphogettable' broth is cleaner and more flavorful. I prefer my pho with rare steak, and always order the #13 with my steak on the side. The only thing I wish they had was more choices for steak, such as ribeye or even filet mignon. I'd pay the extra $$ for better quality cuts. I also appreciate that they've kept the prices so low throughout the years. Another thing I mist highlight is the prompt, friendly and accommodating service I receive every time without exception. Most servers know my wife and I's order by heart. Great experience always.",

I ordered the seafood and veggie and according to the menu, it was to have imitation crab but I did not find a single piece in the dish.  The dish came with 2 shrimp (the best thing in the dish).  The calamari was inedible as it was sooooooooooooo tough. The salmon fish balls had a weird consistency to them and didn't taste anything at all like salmon.  I tried my husbands brisket and preferred mine over his.  He wasn't crazy about his either.  The portion sizes are way to big and if you take it home, it will be no good later because noodle soups become gross later. Not a place I would probably return to.  Just saying...................",

Packed with flavor, unlike some of the previous reviews have mentioned.  The woman came over and told me to mix some of the hoisin sauce with some of the hot sauce and lime juice.  I tried her suggestion and dipped the meat into it - man, how awesome this stuff was...  She also mentioned they do not use MSG.    I'd hit this place up again in a heartbeat for some of the best pho ever!",

General: Wait staff were very quick and attentive from the moment we stepped in, ordering, food and service. Tables are clean and spacious enough for kids. This would be a great place for a family meal or date. Food: We ordered #1 (traditional pho with variety of meat cuts, this is the one you want if you just want a hot bowl of Pho), and #31 (vermicelli noodles with grilled shrimp and beef). Portions were big and very very tasty. Reasonably priced for the portion size.",

    "text": "I have been here a couple of times and I'll most likely be back because I love that I can trust the meatballs to be GF but probably just for takeout due to poor service and a server spilling soup resulting in burns.   Food: I order the #1 Pho and A1 spring rolls with shrimp & pork. The pho is pretty good here and it's one of the only places that I can safely eat the beef meatballs knowing they are gluten free so that's nice. The pho is definitely the star dish here... spring rolls are OK but probably wouldn't order again.   Service: I don't expect a lot as far as service goes at any Vietnamese restaurant around town, however I would expect that when the server spills your piping hot bowl of pho all over the table and onto your lap and burns you that they at least wipe up the soup that is all over the table (or maybe bring you extra napkins or a towel to do so without having to be asked). Also, if I was an owner/manager and my server were to do so, I would be a little bit apologetic and maybe offer a discount or comp something... just a thought considering the fact that a significant amount of soup was spilled on a customers lap causing burns (I would post a photo to show but they are in places not appropriate for Yelp). They did give us a $4 discount on a $55 bill after we mentioned the spilled soup, but regardless... I get accidents happen. But typically it would (and should be) handled better.",

    "text": "I mean, the place isn't TOTAL garbage. But frankly, I've been to better pho places. Places where the meat portions aren't so skimpy in the pho soups, and the vegetables served are diverse and multi textured. Also, the broth needs to be abundant and not skimpy either.  That's the thing, this place may have decent pho broth, but the fact that they provide so little quantity in the bowl that arrives for the price makes me want to make the extra drive westward towards central Phoenix to hit up a better Pho place. Or head south to one of the plentiful pho places in Chandler.  Then there's the vegetables. See, Vietnamese food is about textures. And vegetables are a HUGE part of Vietnamese cuisine. For instance, in the pho that I order from here, the vegetable dish that you're supposed to dunk into the soup, it really just comes with bean sprouts and basil, the two cheapest vegetables that a restaurant can provision to its customers. What about cilantro? That's cheap, why can't there be a plentiful amount of that on the vegetable dish? What about the infamous \"sawtooth herb\" that more authentic Vietnamese restaurants will carry?   So, authenticity. That's a big one. And it's hard to talk about \"authenticity\" because let's face it, Vietnamese cuisine as we know it in the USA is very \"southern Vietnam\", which is really a collection of Vietnamese and French influence. American too, if the Vietnamese food is from Saigon (which was occupied by the US during the Vietnam war).   I bring up authenticity because this place really doesn't hammer it for me. It seems like they take all the cheapest parts of American-perceived Vietnamese cuisine and serve it to you. A great example is their noodle dishes that come with lettuce. The better restaurants will serve \"green leaf lettuce\" and not iceberg. Iceberg is cheap, lacks nutrition and frankly doesn't taste good. Also, the lack of mint in these dishes makes me scratch my head as to why the restaurant almost deliberately holds itself back.  The only thing I can possibly think of is that the restaurant is trying to cater to a specific demographic of customer that devalues things like green leaf lettuce, mint, sawtooth herb. I don't buy the idea that the restaurant doesn't have the financial resources to provision these basic herbs that can literally be bought walking distance from Mekong Market in the same shopping plaza.  To end the review on a positive note, I will say this: It may have been smart for the restaurant to hire on servers that speak fluent English, however, part of me wonders why there is a need for that in the 21st century. Since everyone has a smartphone or at least an Internet connection, even newcomers to Vietnamese food can quickly run a Google search to determine what Vietnamese food is all about, and know upon eating at Unphogettable that this restaurant really isn't the place for a True Pho experience.",

When the food came out only 4 bowls came out in which 1 was incorrect- one was sent back and they still needed clarification on what we all ordered. Second round, they brought out 2 more bowls of the correct order. I waited an addition 5 mins for my food to come out... and they gave me a kid bowl at this point, I was so hungry I didn't care and I told them to give it to me.  They only brought out 2 out of the 6 accoutrements (basil, sprouts, lime and jalapeno) until they were asked to bring out more. None of the pho bowls had cilantro or onion in it.   Not the mention while our party waited... an employee was walking around collecting hoisin and sriracha bottles and squirting/consolidating them in the seat next to me. The same employee fussed at another employee in Vietnamese for wiping down the table too much.   Service today was off... exceptionally off. Food was good, possibly because my stomach was eating itself.",

It seems to be hearty noodle soup with rich broth that can be kicked up a few notches with bean spouts (for added crunch), fresh basil, hoisin and sriracha.    I love the fact that I have some measure of control over how spicy I can make it or how what I add can affect the taste.  Maybe I just like the process.  unPhogettable is a corny name.  I had solicited advise from my friends on FB on where to get good pho.  Khai Hoan was the definite consensus but it was closed that day.  unPhogettable was next.    Located in the Mekong Plaza, I did get the sense that it should be decent.  It's surrounded by other asian restaurants and an asian supermarket.  It wouldn't reflect well on the business if it wasn't good.  From the get-go, the service was friendly and fast.  I'm assuming it was the owner who stopped and talked with us but she was super friendly and helpful.  We ordered spring rolls (with pork and shrimp) served with peanut sauce, hot tea, vietnamese coffee and two bowls of pho (one brisket and the other veggie).  Everything came fast and was delicious.  The peanut sauce that accompanied the spring rolls was soo good.  I loved the pho.  It was tasty and hot.  Having added everything provided to me, it made the soup even better.  Like I said, I'm no pho connoissuer but this pho was really good to me.  All together I think it ran us $25. Can't wait to go back.",

I found the chicken meat to be rather strange-- thick slices of what appeared to be chicken but tasted more like turkey breast.  Is that so bad you ask? Well, I found the meat to have a tough, flavorless consistency.  As a cook, I have a feeling that the broth was created with some commercial bouillon and then pieces of chicken? turkey? were thrown in.  This makes sense considering that most of their menu is soup based.  They have to be using alternative ways of creating broth. When I make chicken soup, the meat in its bone creates the broth and then you pull the meat off the bone and voila! a delicious, meaty  chicken broth.  This was not the case here. It was probably the worst PHO we have had in a long time.  My husband commented that the PHO we had in Paris, France was one hundred percent better than this PHO??  Can you believe the french make better PHO than Vietnamese in Mesa?  I remember the PHO in Paris so I can't disagree.  The point here is that Unphogettable better step up its game because you can live on your past reputation for only so long.  I did notice that there were not many ethnics eating here only non-vietnamese locals.  I am beginning to wonder if these people are the ones rating the place 4 and 5 stars when Unphogettable no longer serves good food and has basically lost its mojo.  BTW, a little research led me to fact that their regular chef is no longer there.   I ,  for one , am NOT returning either.  (The service was fine).",

Other than that, the menus is very extensive ---but if you looked around and see what other people got, it was 80% pho!  So yes!  When in doubt, get the pho.  We all got pho and it was pretty good.  The other plus is the 3 bean dessert drink was also yummy.",

You quickly forget your at a Pho restaurant as the Waiters come to your table explaining the menu, and assisting you make the best decision. They come back and check on you frequently always ready to assist you. (If you are a frequent at asian restaurants then you know that customer service is not usually their forte.)  I had the Chicken Pho and asked for vegetables with it (they offer this on their menu). The broth was delicious and light like I wanted and the vegetables were so fresh, just lightly cooked and still crunchy.   We had an order of egg rolls and those too were delicious.   My husband had the Beef Pho (combination with all of the meats) and it was absolutely hands down the best I've ever tasted. I loved it so much that we went back the next day and I ordered the same one.  When my husband and I travel back through Arizona we will be stopping here again to have more of their fresh delicious food.   PS, my husband and I are now in LA, and reading some of the other yelp reviews, yes the Pho here is a little cheaper, but Unphogettable's pho is well worth the price because it is the freshest, tastiest Pho I've ever had. You can't be cheap when you want good food.",

The broth and noodles tastes the same as the ones we have in LA. Thank you Vietnamese chefs who makes good broth!  By the way, if you get super full off the food, you can walk around the market! It's an Asian market, so if you live in a area that only has Albert-son, Fry's or Ralph you should definitely stop by for some Asian grocery shopping, maybe you can make some at home and enjoy a Vietnamese meal ;)  can't wait to come back again.",

The owner dove into the menu, explaining that he liked to educate his customers so we knew exactly what we were getting. That personal touch won me over immediately.  Then the pho came out. I don't exaggerate when I say it was the best I've had in a while. It might have been because of the fresh ingredients the owner told us about, or the good ratio of broth-to-meat-to-veggies, but either way it was delicious. The egg rolls were also tasty, but I just wish we were served more (that's more of a comment on my appetite).  I've been back several times, and unPhogettable does not dissapoint. Also, check out the massive Asian grocery store attached. If you want alcohol, you're allowed to buy some there and bring it in. Bonus points!",

But because I am a food adventurer I acquiesced to his repeated suggestion.  This diner (I will not describe it as a restaurant) is in a shopping center serving, what might be described as the Asian market, adjacent to an Asian/international supermarket.  It was clean and had a number of patrons. We were immediately greeted and seated. Our service throughout the evening was courteous and gracious.  I requested from our server than my order be the house specialty pho', which she identified as #1. I made a point of telling her that I consider the 'side vegetables' an important part of my meal and that I use/eat ALL my side produce (people who eat pho' know what I'm talking about).  When my dinner was served I had to stop myself from exclaiming out loud. The first thing out of my mouth was to tell my dinner companion that was the last meal I would have at 'Un pho gettable.'  The pho' is nearly twice the cost of all three locations in CenPho (central Phx). The dish of produce additives was so conservative that I still huff to think about it. And, the flavor (lack thereof) of the broth/meat was disappointing.  Service and cleanliness is very important, hence the three stars.",

The entree dishes are a a couple bucks more than some other places but you're fine with that. Don't sweat a couple bucks you cheap ass because it's worth it. Open 7 days. Great especially for summer with the fresh tastes, don't be shy on the pho just because it's hot out. It just takes longer to start sweating once you leave. So good.

    "text": "This is the 3rd Vietnamese restaurant I've visited in the area, and my least favourite. I wavered between a 3 and 4 star review. The service was great, which would generally have bumped my review up to a 4, but they were a little too much. We waited for another family to arrive, and even though we informed them that we would let them know when we were ready, I think we were asked if we needed service about 8 times before we finally ordered.   This restaurant is located in the Mekong shopping plaza. Maybe it's because of this that the standard fare is pricier than other places.  We came in with a group of 9 people, 6 adults and 3 kids after the age of 5.   Food: Food was good. The portions are typical, enough for an adult to be full. The kids got their own bowls of food that were more than enough. I think the kids' meals were under $6.  We ordered the spring rolls, which I found were pretty pricey for what they were. Furthermore, the peanut sauce was not very good. The pho was decent, but not something I'd write home about. I ordered a vermicelli bowl with beef and shrimp. It was tasty, but I just felt like some flavour profile was missing.   Their coconut drink is not fresh - beware. Or maybe it is, and they just dump some extra sugar in the drink for fun.   Service: They were great with the kids and gave them pencil crayons and a colouring page for them to play with while they waited for their food. There were too many servers who didn't communicate. Within 5 minutes, we had what felt like every single waiter in the restaurant come up and ask us what we wanted to order.",

Aside from the cost comparison - this place did taste pretty good. The portion sizes were also a little smaller than what I'm used to, but Socal is a little more saturated with Vietnamese food. If I feel a sudden craving for pho, I'll definitely be back here! But if I'm looking for a cheap & quick meal, I may be looking elsewhere...",

Nobody should be paying over $9 MAX for a bowl of pho, it's outrageous.  Service and the restaurant itself was nice. The cell signal kind of sucks all throughout Mekong Plaza, if you are indoors. (I'm AT&T.)  To be fair, the Viet broken rice plate place across from Unphogettable is also super expensive, but their rice plates are SOOOO good.  On the other hand, Unphogettable's pho is totally forgettable, nothing to write home about, and wayyy too expensive for pho.  Their name is a cute pun though.",

Towards the end of a vacation, I tend to crave Vietnamese food (I'm Vietnamese and from Dallas!) but things usually get pretty tricky because I'm always comparing them to restaurants back at home. Everyone should have a staple for their pho and if I lived in Phoenix, unPhogettable would probably be my go-to place for pho despite some setbacks.   The broth is pretty standard and has a decent flavor to it. The vegetables are very fresh and great quality. Unfortunately the meats are kind of \"eh\". The meatballs were mediocre, the tendons were alright, but a couple of the meats in my friend's \"pho dac biet\" were really tough and hard to eat. unPhogettable does it's job of satisfying a pho craving though.  What I don't like about this place is that there seems to be only one size of pho. Most places have small and large. I feel as if they are wasting a lot of food by giving everyone the same sized bowl. The prices are higher compared to other pho places as well. $9.75 for a bowl of pho dac biet? I have never paid $10 for a bowl of pho. It's usually around $7-8.",

    "text": "Craving pho on a Sunday morning, my friends and I decided to drive 20 mins to the only pho place available....this one. Location was cute and convenient, and attached to the shopping center's grocery market. When we walked in, it was extremely busy or anything so we were seated right away and given drinks.   For appetizers we ordered the spring rolls and the egg rolls. Disappointing. The spring rolls are a very easy dish to make, noodles, veggies, meat and sometimes you add shrimp......no, the noodles weren't cooked all the way, the meat was tough and dry, and the veggies weren't fresh, pretty sure the lettuce came out of a bag.  Not to mention the peanut sauce just tasted like straight up peanut butter, that's not how its remotely supposed to taste. The eggrolls were also subpar.  When it came to the entree I got a beef pho with flank, tendon and a few other meats. First thing I notices was that the broth was a lot more clear than any other pho I'd eaten. Rest assured, it tasted just like it looked, hot water! I drowned it in sriracha, hoisen and extra lime just to make it taste better. Meat again was dry just like the spring rolls had been. I was sad.....I just wanted decent pho and this was not it.   Not to mention one of my friends found a tiny piece of a plastic wrapper in her dish. Cute name, cute place.....food no bueno.",

So obviously I didn't try the pho here but I did get the vermicelli with egg rolls and pork, as well as the bi cuon and those two were okay. The vermicelli was sweeter than the ones in LA for some reason (maybe it's that fish sauce) and for $9, I guess it's okay. 2 small rolls of bi cuon for $5 was a blasphemy to me because back in the LA or even the OC, we could get 4 rolls for the same price that tasted much better. But, the ones here were still decent so I'm not complaining.  Overall: Food is good, prices could be better but hey since they don't have much competition, I guess it's okay.",

We ordered Pho with brisket, flank & lean steak and pork chop rice plate for main course.  The beef broth lacked the rich beef, herbs and veggie flavor, and the most disappointing, the grilled pork chop was drowing in a hoison sauce accompanied with steam rice rather than broken rice.  The menu clearly stated steam rice, but I should have stuck to my instinct that this restaurant lacked the authenticity.  When I asked the server for the nuoc cham dipping sauce, I had to explain the ingredients before they understood my request.    Sadly, my meal was Pho-gettable... Hopefully, it was an off day.",

She says its the closest place in Arizona to her bf's San Francisco restaurant. Usually, I only eat Pho and drink water since the portion is too big for me. This time, I ate spring rolls, the ENTIRE bowl of Pho, and drank the lemonade-soda. The soda was sweet and made me want more. I left feeling very full and happy! It was an unPhogettable experience! =)",

I dunno... there's something to all those non-choice cuts of animals that makes a meal authentic.  Alright, the pho portion sizes are huge, the broth is quite flavorful and served acceptably hot (could be scalding-ier though), the vermicelli is good (hard to screw that up), cuts of meat were tender, greens abundant.  A solid bowl.  I'm less impressed with their Bun Bo Hue.  The noodles are very tender, again cuts of meat are tender, but there is absolutely no heat to the broth.  Also, I'm not sure if it's a culinary choice by unPhogettable chefs, but no congealed blood?  Service is quick and the staff is very friendly.  Despite being a sit-down restaurant with table service, the atmosphere inside has a very cafeteria feel.  (It's hard to put in words, but when you step inside, it makes more sense)  Prices are a bit on the high side for a pho joint, but still very reasonable and by no means expensive.  Portion sizes are large.  Definitely more trips for the pho, but as a Bun Bo Hue afficionado, that was a bit disappointing.",

    "text": "I judge every Pho place by their Pho Tai.   unPhogettable's pho has an incredible broth. They also don't skimp on the pho toppings (I should really learn what these toppings are called--it's the dish with the basil, sprouts, jalapenos, limes, etc). I like the atmosphere of this restaurant because you can exit to the parking lot in the front or to the Asian market area in the back which reminds me of the small malls strewn about in the semi-urban areas of Japan and Thailand.   Only issue I have with this place is the price. You have to pay $8+ per bowl while Saigon Pho in Chandler is $5-6 and has better pho and quicker service.  Pho kind of reminds me of Chipotle. The heavily frequented Chipotles tend to have the best quality food (this is anecdotal but I am a former manager of Chipotle so I'd like to think I speak from legitimate experience). I'm talking tightly rolled, good salsa and sour cream distribution, the works. They simply get more practice and it shows. The unfrequented Chipotles tend to suffer in overall food quality. This goes for Saigon and unPhogettable in the same way. unPhogettable just doesn't have as many people come through so they don't really have the pho experience down to a science (yet). Nonetheless, you'll still enjoy great food and a nice walk through the market afterwards.",

The rolls were very tasty and fresh. My fiance loved his coffee, but he is very particular about his broth and found it to be just average. I'm not as picky and was happy that my pho came along with tendon and tripe.   I shall be back for some more unPHOgettable feedings Pho sho!",

The clean, modern interior was horizontally arranged with wall-to-wall paintings and natural lighting coming through the windows.   The Nem Nuong Cuon ($4.95) came with pork sausage, fried bread stick, and fresh veggies wrapped in rice paper. The roll tasted fresh, with the centrality of fatty pork flavors coming through to couple with good textures from the veggies. It was a solid choice, but not the best or the most affordable when value was taken into consideration.   The Com Ca Nuong ($11.25) came with grilled two fillets of tilapia, pickled veggies, a bowl of soup, and steamed rice. The price was too high when compared to other Vietnamese restaurants. The selection of the fish was not the best, and the seasoning was overpowering and salty. Thankfully for the bowl of soup that helped to balance the taste buds. I don't recommend it.  Service was hands-off but attentive and friendly when we needed them. Overall, their prices were higher than most places I have been, and the presentation and quality did not justify the higher mark up. Since many Yelpers have raved about their pho and other noodle items, I would be interested in coming back and give them another chance.",

And then there was that other pho place on Southern and Extension that had a double murder occur which made it shut down. Now that place was good but it's closed indefinitely.  Now back to this place...  I usually order the Beef pho #1 and like I said, flavor is getting better. It's probably your best bet in the Tempe/Mesa area so I recommend that you give this place a try.

    "text": "unPhogettable will be unforgettable for me (at least for good pho in the Chandler/Mesa general area). Came here with a friend on a busy Sunday afternoon. Service was pretty good. They forgot our drink order for awhile but once we reminded them (I say them because we had multiple table servers) our drinks were brought out right away.  I had the Bun Bo Hue which is a little different from the traditional pho on the menu. It has the thicker rice noodles instead of the skinnier pho noodles. It has a very strong spicy beef flavor with a darker broth. The flavor was delicious. Some might find this flavor too strong so I would recommend going with the traditional pho flavors on the front page of the menu if you are a beginning pho connoisseur. My friend and I also started with shrimp spring rolls with peanut sauce which were also delicious.  Sometimes all you need is a delicious, spicy, hearty bowl of soup and pho always hits the spot for me. UnPhogettable does it well.",

We go here for the fantastic pho and friendly service.  They make any kind of pho you could think of, and all are expertly crafted with the perfect base.  My husband, the carnivorous maximus, opts for the tripe and meatball, while I am a veggie pho girl.  We have also tried the bun (vermicelli) here, and it's just ok. The pork is great though, and the owner will give you his cooking secrets if you ask! Speaking of whom is SUPER friendly, and always thanks you for your patronage. He remembers the regulars as well and gets excited when you bring friends and family to share the experience.  If you enjoy great pho, don't hesisate to give unPhogettable a try!",

    "text": "I have to say from a marketing perspective, it was the name that got my attention.  Having said that, I went, and ate.  Coming from TX, my standard is fairly high as we have more than our share of Vietnamese cuisines here.    I got there on a week night with maybe 3 or 4 other tables.  Ordered the combination pho, along with the shrimp/pork spring rolls.  Service was quick as I got my food within 5min of ordering.  First impression was that the size of the bowl seemed smaller than what I've seen, or at least compare to the ones here in TX.  There were only 1 size, so no other options.  Before I put in any condiments and sauce, I always like to taste the soup first as that's usually the most important part of pho.  In this case, I thought the soup has a heavy flavor of tripe.  I ordered the combination, so naturally it has the tripe, which I do enjoy, but just didn't expect the soup itself has that flavor as well.  It was light, and seemed to lack the depth of the typical pho flavoring, with the lemon grass and other flavors.    Overall, it was OK.  Also had the spring rolls.  They too were just OK.  They were quite sticky from what I recall, so not sure if it's been sitting there for awhile?    Overall, I have to say I like the name of this restaurant.  But the food is really just average.  As I was craving some boba drink, but that's one thing they do not have on their menu.  I was also craving a bahn mi, which they also don't have.",

I also have always been fond of Mekong Plaza.  I almost feel like I shouldn't be sharing this with every one because I'd like to keep it my own little secret. The New Times never steers me wrong.  Great service the second I walked in the door. They have their own homemade sauces (plum sauce and two spicy sauces). When I opened the menu, I was astounded. At least $1 cheaper than Pho Ao Sen for every menu item. The spring rolls (#A2) were amazing with shrimp. They were so fresh.  Then I got the #9 pho with well-done brisket and rare steak. It was as good as it gets. Afterwards, stopped off at the supermarket and bought some well priced and tasty sake.  I will definitely be back. Yum!",

The contrasting hot/ cold and sweet/spicy elements came together in a refreshingly unique way.  Go in with an open mind and if you like, the staff is ready to provide you with a first class education on how to enjoy the flavors of Vietnam.

Decided to look for more interesting eatery and found a Vietnamese place near the resort.  Yelp reviews were really bad.  One of the reviews mentioned Unphogettable.  When I looked up Unphogettable on Yelp, there were many positive reviews.  Although the restaurant was 20 miles away, we took a chance and glad we did.  This was the first Pho restaurant that I've been to where staff were attentive.  Owner came by to ask if everything was ok.  Wow!  That was the first.  By the way, good food too!  We will definitely make an effort to go back while we are in town.",

    "text": "This place is fine if you can tolerate the Pho-Nazi.  Under no circumstances, put anything in your pho; this includes Sirracha, hoisin sauce, chili sauce, etc.  The Pho-Nazi will be quick to point out the delicate texture, and full flavor of the broth, and how you are ruining it with your application of sauce.  Ok Pho-Nazi:  I am hung over, my eyes focus independantly, and everytime you speak, it sounds like a chainsaw buzzing in my ear.  I oblige you to make you go away.  Then I pour what I want in my pho.  Second attempt on this place was in fact not hung over.  I walked up to a packed restaurant, waited for 5 min. at the hostess stand, and then was waived off, waitress yelling across the crowded restaurant, \"WE ARE CLOSED!\"  Oh well I guess I didn't get the memo.  No posted hours on yelp, and no sign with hours.  Huh.  I guess I should have thought twice about putting sauce in my Pho.    TL;DR:  Don't piss off the Pho-Nazi, and your experience will be fine.",

Though, as I always do, I added a ton of sriracha and hoison to make it even more delicious. Ohmygosh my mouth is watering at the thought.   Also - I'm usually not a huge fan of shrimp spring rolls, I tend to find them somewhat blah, but the shrimp spring rolls here are quite enjoyable!

    "text": "Oh, I hesitated before we entered this what seems to be a pretty highly rated yelp restaurant...  The only reason for 2 stars instead of a one  is a super friendly service. Our waiters were excellent, very helpful and accommodating. It is absolutely not their fault that food is mediocre. Actually, what was strange is that they charged our CC just the amount on the bill and did not include the tip my husband left. Bill was $26.40, my husband signed for $31, but online I see a charge of $26.40 only.  I don't know if I should call and make sure that waiters got their tip... I guess, I will do it on Monday.  We ordered pho chin ( well done brisket ). The broth was good, but nothing spectacular, brisket itself was still pretty chewy and tasteless. I expected it to be at least a little bit better, but if you are hungry and want something hot, go for it. The portion is very generous.  Vegetable Cha Gio (Fried Vietnamese egg rolls) was completely soaked in some oil, which totally ruined the dish. It looked like their fryer was not hot enough when they dipped rolls for cooking. Another possibility is that oil was old. Neither of the scenarios excites me.  Vermicelli with seasoned grilled shrimps disappointed as well. There were only 5 tiny shrimps on the top, pretty rubbery but tasty. The rest seemed to be 2 pounds of vermicelli.  I don't know what everyone else with 5 star reviews ate there, but whatever we had was not that. I don't mind cheap, ethnic food, and I know that it can be inexpensive but still very good.   I will not repeat, but I encourage you to try. Maybe, it was a bad day and you will get something better. Again, the service is very friendly, I kind of feel bad leaving such a negative review, but I cannot lie and led other people believe that the food was good.",

I ordered the Viet iced tea with cream which was a lot less sweet than the Thai teas I'm used to, it was surprising but still very delicious.  The appetizer ordered was the Summer Rolls which house a large hunk of spicy sausage in it, the sauce to dip it in was really sweet and didn't cling to the roll well, I think I'd rather have had hoisin sauce with it.  I ordered the white meat combo noodle soup bowl.  This consisted of a couple of pieces of imitation crab, fish cake balls, shrimp, pork slices and calamari.  Each was quite good in its own right except the imitation crap which had started to flake and come apart in the hot broth.  The broth by the way was fabulous, didn't overpower the meats but added enough flavor to them, much like a fondue broth, while still more than delicious enough to slurp the rest of the way through once all the solid bits were gone.  The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is even after showing we've been around the block with Vietnamese food we were constantly being given instructions on what was good and what newcomers to Vietnamese cuisine should try.  I mean once is good service, but after the customer replies that they've had it before don't continue to treat them like newbie white devils...some of us are a little more travelled than others, thanks.",

    "text": "Their pho is the worst I had in the az area.  with respect to the other rave review, their only saving grace is good service, esp for people who had not had vietnamese food before, as their servers do speak better english and because they are not crowded usually, they would have more time and patience to explain the food to you.    The reason why they are not crowded is because they are located in a vietnamese/asian centric mall with large crowds of asians shopping for food and groceries at the mekong supermarket, and they know a good pho from a bad one.  Trust me I am asian :)     Going here would be like a vegetarian going to texas roadhouse and having them cook up a steak and try to explain to you the fine art of grilling aged beef.    If you are at the Mekong plaza area, and U need some vietnamese food, go to the other vietnamese restaurant that is directly across from them, I can't recall the name, but they have a large menu full of rice dishes and stuff.  U can order like noodle items too, I love their dry house special noodles there.    If you are new to vietnamese food and would like an intro, I guess this place might work, so 1 star for that.  there are a lot of other places U can go to like Khai Hoang, Dat Vang or even Saigon.",

Their food is relatively healthy in comparison to other Asian cuisine restaurants and the Pho is AMAZING....I've eaten at Da Vang about 4-5 times and this place is MUCH better. The broth in the Pho is flavored perfectly and the meat is oh so tender. I always get the #4 Pho with brisket and the #17 egg rolls, both of which are amazing.   The food is delicious, but it's the service that really makes this place. After having visited only 2-3 times, the owners now recognize me and my family when we come in and helpfully explain how to eat the food to maximize the experience.   The prices are reasonable, the food is good, and the service is top notch.",

We were planing in trying Unphogettable last year when we were here, but we got sidetracked and it was our loss.  The restaurant is in front of an Asian grocery store and we got there a little before closing (at 8p).  My wife and I ordered our usual of Spring Rolls and two Chicken Pho's.  The service was very friendly and quick.  We counted 4 different prople who stopped by our table to make sure everything was OK and our diet drinks were always full. The Spring Rolls were fresh, with a thin slice of pork roast and the sauce was peanut buttery.  I like my dipping sauce more on the hoisin side, but these had the first one that I actually really liked that was on the peanut side!  The Pho was good and very hot, with the chicken shredded into small pieces, akin to shredded pork, mixed well with the noodles.  The beansprouts, cilantro and jalapeno's that came with the soup were just barely enough compared to other soup places I had visited.  Overall, it was a nice place and we'll be back to try it again.",

It did not taste bad by any means, but that flavor explosion that you usually get in your mouth with pho just wasn't there. I will have to give them a second chance, maybe it was an off day.",

As mentioned, the Bun was terrific too. Fresh herbs, great little fried egg roll, etc.   The owner explained that they cook the broth for 26 hours. Flavor flave style.  Wait, can Flaver Flave actually cook? No one knows! And I don't want to find out. Just get your face into some of their fine soups and other delicious Vietnamese creations.",

I ate here when my family and friends came into town for my graduation, and my friend's going away party was held at UnPhogettable. My parents talk about how good the pho was the last time they visited, and my boyfriend thinks their veggie pho is better than anywhere else.  I love that the same waitress that served me 5 years ago is still happy to see me when I come to dine, and I always enjoy the casual conversations I have with the owners each time I visit.  I think I feel like a part of the family when I enter this place, and perhaps that's why this restaurant is unforgettable in my opinion.  My favorite is #21 (seafood pho), but I have had most of the things on the menu by stealing some bites from my friends here and there.  The veggie pho (#23) is refreshing and has a clean after taste.  The rare steak and brisket (#9) seems to be a good choice for a person who has never tasted pho before.  There are plenty of other items on the menu starting from vermicelli bowls and grilled meats.  I think if you want to try some Vietnamese food that is consistently good, UnPhogettable would be a great place for you.",

I have been eating a lot in the San Gabriel Valley in LA and they have alot of Pho restaurants and I think that's why I don't like this place anymore like I use to.  I will say, though, compared to many other Pho places in Arizona,  this is definitely one of the better ones.  It's also one of the more cleaner ones.  My friends that do cosplay love to meet here weekly love it.  For me, I prefer this Pho place over others in Arizona, but it's still never great compared to restaurants in LA.  The ones I always get is the #1 or #2 menu pho beef bowls.  I do really like the spring rolls, but they are different then normal ones because they use iceberg lettuce in it.   They have a really delicious peanut sauce that you can dip it with! :)    As for the sitting area, there are alot of places to sit and if you come on a weekend, it tends to be a little crowded.  The restaurant is clean and there is plenty of parking.  What's cool about it is that it is in indoor plaza where you can walk out and there is a Asian grocery store and other Asian giftshops.",

The staff also recommended the combonation fried rice. It is the best tasting fried rice I've had in a very long time. It has chunks of bbq pork ribs, chicken & a few shrimp which i don't mind because the balance works well together. The spring rolls are also a great appetizer w/ peanut dipping sauce. Overall it's the best having ate other Pho joints in rural & local areas.",

    "text": "unPhogettable Mekong Plaza 66 S. Dobson Road Mesa 85202  There are as many styles of the ubiquitous Vietnamese dish pho (pronounced PHA) as there are people that eat it, and of course, everyone has their favorite. Having eaten pho from one end of this country to the other, this is my favorite place to eat this wonderful dish.  We were seated immediately, and our drink order was taken. This isn't a fancy restaurant, but you wouldn't know it by the attentive service and spotless tables.  Companion and I started out with the Goi Cuon ($3.45), which are soft spring rolls filled with shrimp, pork and veggies and served with a delightful peanut sauce. If it were not for the fact that we were there for dinner, I'd probably have made it a double order and had just that, they were so good. Being made with soft rice paper brought a whole new texture to the party, and I loved the peanut sauce with it.  For main courses, companion ordered Pho Dac Bjet Bo Vien ($8.25) which is a soup tureen sized bowl of wonderful broth, filled with noodles, rare steak slices, flank, brisket, tendon, tripe, and beef meatballs, and asked for the tripe to be left out, since companion isn't fond of it. It was no problem for the kitchen to prepare it the way companion wanted it.  I ordered the same thing but with extra tendon ($3.00), since I love the texture of this item.   In making their broth, it is simmered for a minimum of 24 hours, which results in a hugely flavorful base for the pho. For those that don't care to have some of the more esoteric ingredients in their pho, there are many choices on the menu including a pho made with chicken breast and another one that is vegetarian. The pho is served with a plate of fresh Thai basil, bean sprouts, lime, and jalapeno's for those that like to add to the bowl. I always add some fish sauce which is on the table because I love the flavor of it.  It's hard to describe a bowl of pho except to say it is a meal in a bowl that is huge! If I eat this for lunch, my meals for the day are taken care of, since it is so big. (Yes, they will provide a take out for the rest if you need one.)  For those that prefer something other than pho (there are 16 varieties of pho), there are also 15 other types of soup on the menu, as well as 11 types of salads, 6 vegetarian selections, and a number of steamed rice items as well. Kids are welcome and have their own selections.  Restrooms have always been clean when I have been there, and service is so friendly you feel almost like your eating in a friends house.  I give them 4 stars for service, quality of food, and cleanliness. (And a big YUM for flavor!)",

Its also the only place we've ever eaten Pho, so I don't feel qualified to comment on the authenticity of the food, but it tastes so good, so fresh, so delicious, that even if it were not authentic, I would still give it 5 stars.  The last trip we made was an incredibly hot day, I ordered a lime soda (soda water and an abundance of fresh squeezed lime juice, with a lime wedge and ice....so refreshing!) with one of the salads...rice vermicelli with shrimp sausage.  Absolutely perfect for a hot day.  I enjoyed immensely.  Also, at the end of our meal, the owner came walking in and whether he actually recognized us or not, I have no idea (we've only been 2 or 3 times before) but he ACTED like he knew us and came walking up and again greeted us with \"Thank you for bringing your family today\".  Gotta love it.",

My wife felt like they had cut down on the fresh ingredient dish and noodles.  My dish seemed like they cut down on the tofu and vegetables and the noodles as well.  This is the first time we left disappointed.   We'll give it another try but if they have a repeat performance of tonight we will write this restaurant off.",

The resaurant is situated on the left side of the entrance to the Mekong grocery store (which, by the way, blows Lee Lee's away).    The service was fast and very friendly.  On the clean scale I give it a 10 out of 10.  Our waitress took the time to ask us if we have had pho before (a first) gave us the general overview of the menu (a first) and when we went to pay they wanted to know how we found the place (also a first).  Normally at a Vietnamese place there is little eye contact with the workers and little conversation.     We had the beef pho, it arrived very fast, less than 5 min, and it was delicious.  Spring roll also very good.  Would have given 5 stars if they took my plate when I was done.  Otherwisea  great experience and I'll be back.",

You might be wondering what I'm talking about but there is a way to mix the sauce in the tiny bowl to dip the meat in etc. Anywho, the price is alright, I think its the typical price per plate but totally worth it.

The restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what I meant with Asian restaurant.  If your fellow Asians don't patronize the place, it is  because your food did not meet our expectation.

It also could have had a little more meat (had rare beef slices and well done brisket variety). Another tasty rendition of Pho was the Chicken Pho and it tasted great as well. A gorgeous looking vegetable plate was also a hit at our table. Shrimp Spring Rolls were excellent and a bargain v/s the others. The owner was a delightful man who said they cook Pho Broth for at least 24 hours. I \"Go For The Pho\" in Vietnamese Restaurants, thus I can only give it three stars when comparing it to others I have had, but a very nice rendition of Pho Phavorites!",

I drove to Orange County, CA all the time in college just to get Pho. I'd like to think I have some Pho cred. But hey I know this is AZ- the pho competition  is not like in CA where there's larger Vietnamese communities/restaurants. This place really skimps out on noodles and meat. Seriously for the regular bowl of pho it felt like the amount of noodles and meat you get for kiddie size. You know that feeling when you eat all the noodles and meat and you're FULL but there's still all the soup there? Yea not here! I also tried their pork and rice and it that was the nail in the coffin. The pork meat tasted like rubber and it was amazingly VERY dry. Also try not to burn the sauce on the pork- doesnt taste yummy. I hope I......wait for it......phoget about this place! Service was good though +1.",

    "text": "So I've never had Vietnamese Pho before (pronounced fu, as in fun, without the n) and I decided to try it with a friend of mine who speaks Vietnamese and would be able to tell me what to order and what I was eating and also steer me to the best place in town so I'd have a positive initial Pho experience and want to go back again and again.  unPHOgettable is tucked into an Asian cultural center just south of Main Street on Dobson on the west side of the road and is part of the Asian grocery story, but has it's own entrance and eating area. It had a pretty nice atmosphere, the owner was very helpful and even recognized my friend and his wife as we walked in (I figured they either eat there quite a bit, or the owner remembers him because he doesn't likely see very many tall, geeky, white kids who speak Vietnamese). The menu had a very wide selection and did a decent job of explaining what each of the items are. The owner offered to go over the menu with us, since it was our first time, but my friend told him that he would handle it. The place was pretty clean and the staff was very helpful. My only minor complaint was that there was a minor fish odor in the air, but I wasn't quite sure if it was the restaurant's fish or the adjoining Asian grocery store that had the fishy smell. Either way it wasn't overpowering and didn't detract from our meal at all.  I ordered Pho with thin sliced beef and tendon. I have to admit, that when I looked at the menu, I thought tendon was tenderloin, so I assumed I was ordering thin strips of beef with beef junks. It wasn't until my friend's wife repeated my order with an emphasis on TENDON that I realized what I ordered. Either way though, I'm pretty adventurous so I figured I'd give it a shot. My wife ordered a flat noodle meal instead of the soup since she's had it before. The food didn't take long and we were brought our enormous bowls of Pho with all the trimmings. I added a decent amount of hoisen sauce, and an even more decent amount of hot sauce. The broth in my bowl actually ended up pretty dark red. I added in my bean sprouts, tore up my basil and plopped in my jalapenos to boot. I dug in and was amazed at how great it tasted. I wasn't really amazed that it tasted good, but that it tasted SO good AND I'd never had it before. Why had people kept this a secret from me? It was fantastic and right up my alley. Soup, hot sauce and noodles. I wolfed mine down and even tried my wife's noodle dish, not really enough to give a thorough review, but it was good, and I'd try it again.  The prices weren't bad, I ended up paying about $22 for the two of us to eat our meals and a small appetizer split between 4 people. Range: $7.50 - $12.00.  Sorry for posting without pictures, but I'm sure I'll be back and append some pics to this after my next bowl.  Because of this place, I am now a fan of Vietnamese food, specifically the Pho soup.

I get my usual pho tai which is super basic with just rare steak and noodles in broth. The broth flavor is decent but not as flavorful as I would like. It's decent quality but I do enjoy other places more. The spring rolls are good and authentic and the sauce is yummy.   Overall, your average pho place. Decently good but not the best I've ever had. :/",

    "text": "After hearing all the raves and rants from our Asian friends, I checked out the Mekong Plaza today, and of course had to start tasting every single restaurant on that premise.  unPHOgettable was our first choice, because bf wanted Pho. He got Pho with raw beef, I got the combo rice plate (eggroll, grilled pork chop and jumbo chicken wing). We shared spring rolls for appetizer.  Spring rolls show quality. Each roll was packed with thin slices of pork, and 3 good size shrimps. There was not a lot of herbs, just shredded lettuce. While I was impressed by the amount of pork and shrimp, the roll tasted dry and not very refreshing. It felt \"over-stuffed\" if it makes any sense.  The Pho was alright. Their stock was oily. Most Pho restaurants I've been to here in the US use \"clear\" stock. Even in Vietnam, my family and I specifically avoid the \"oily stock\" (you have 2 options: clear or oily). The taste overall was... alright. It felt like it was missing something. It tasted good at the tip of the tongue, but ended there. It was not flavorful enough to make you \"want to slurp down the whole bowl\" - said bf.  The rice was, again, alright. It came with a small bowl of soup (which is the stock for egg-noddle soup. It's pretty oily as well). The chicken wing would have tasted better had they not batter-fried it. The pork chop was tender and flavorful however.   Overall experience was OK. We were full, but feeling unsatisfied.  Price range: appetizers are about $3.50, main entrees are about $8.50",

For a first-timer like me, I needed the explanation (What the heck is Pho? How do you say it? What are your recommendations?)  If soup isn't your thing, they have plenty of dishes that will satisfy hunger. I always order the combo platter which comes with a seasoned pork chop, chicken wing, spring roll, rice, and a small bowl of seasoned broth. To die for!!!   Service is incredible. They remember us every time we come in, which makes me feel like this is a family place.   If you like coconut, try their coconut juice. They add in a touch of sugar and some young coconut flesh that is really good.   Don't forget to peruse the Mekong Market after you're done with the meal (don't let the smells scare you away. They have some pretty cool stuff in there with amazing prices on produce.)",

    "text": "This restaurant really lives up to its name by being (in my opinion) the best Vietnamese Pho restaurant in Arizona! I've been to a couple of other Pho joints in AZ that were either hit or miss, but this one sets the bar pretty high by balancing quality, flavors, cleanliness, and let's not forget, remarkably fast & friendly service!  I've been to numerous Pho restaurants over the last decade in both California (where I'm from originally) and Arizona to be able to decipher the difference between \"quality\" or lack-there-of. What sets Un-Pho-gettable apart is that they're able to achieve the level of deep flavor in their Pho broth without the use of MSG (which a lot of cheaper Pho joints do to compensate for lack of quality ingredients). I'm not going to knock MSG for being the bad guy, because I personally feel that a little doesn't hurt (it adds flavor). But let's face it, if you can create a good savory dish without it, I'm all for it. IMO, the use of MSG is like cheating (adding flavor to subpar food and sometimes disguising what they don't want you to taste).  The owner was kind enough to give us a little background on his restaurant and how they stand behind quality ingredients and how they choose better cuts of meat, take care in preparing the Pho broth (which when done right, takes a long time to infuse the flavors), and how this is all orchestrated without the use of MSG. Now, our assessment... As soon as our food came to the table and we had our first bite, my GF (who is Vietnamese by the way) agreed with me in delight that we found our new Pho spot in AZ! We were just too spoiled in LA, and just couldn't find the right spot to fill the void in AZ. But let me tell you, the broth was full bodied and robust (the way pho broth is supposed to be), the meat was tender and delicious, and the noodles were on point! We also had an order of egg rolls (Cha Gio) and compared to other places where I sampled this dish, you can tell the wrapper was top quality because of the crisp and texture. Sure the prices are a bit higher than some other Pho restaurants, but it is well worth it to know you are paying for good quality and Pho done right.   If you're looking to try Vietnamese Pho for the first time or you're (like us) just trying to find a new Pho restaurant, do yourself a favor and give them a try.",

I ordered the Seafood Chicken based Rice Noodle Pho with a side order of egg roll that my son and I shared.  The soup had a couple of small shrimp, a couple small pieces of squid and two split tiny shrimp balls.  Although, the broth was very tastey, I didn't think it was worth $8.50.  Nothing special about the eggroll.    Hubby ordered the curry based beef soup.  It was more or less stewed beef peppered with pho spices.  A little lackluster for my taste.  The price is a little more than what I wanted to pay for a so-so pho.  There are 3 or 4 choices of soup on the KID'S MENU.  The service was excellent!  We'll go back to try other entrees on their menu.",

Of all of the Pho restaurants that I have been to in Phoenix, I would say that this one is close to the top. Really accessable and easy to find and attached to a great international market. It has a laid back style to it and the waitstaff is very friendly.    A quick tip for any bowl of Pho that you get, order extra noodles on the side instead of another bowl if you are still hungry. It is a lot less expensive and gives you more to eat.",

Their prices are rather high for essentially a bowl of Top Ramen with some brisket, but it's still quite tasty!  When two of us get Pho and drinks, I believe the total is usally around $20-$25.  If money's tight, there are several cheaper options in the area that are still very good.  My only complaint (again) is the price.  Not sure why noodles, broth, and a few slices of meat are so expensive.",

Seriously, sometimes it is like a Jimmy Johns commercial, we order our food and they bring it out a minute later. If you are new to pho or you aren't sure what you should put in your pho, just go with the brisket, you will love it. The only problem is the plaza that they are in can get busy and there will be no parking and 30 cars circling the parking lot. No restaurant is good enough to put up with that. It seems like half the time we go there we end up going somewhere else because there it no parking.",

I ordered vege noodle and spring eggroll, but didn't realize the eggroll had meat/seafood or vege/tofu options. She pointed out, and let us to do half and half. Other than that I might give 2 stars.) I had Thai tea, which was not surprised. It was actually like something you could find in grocery store and make at home. My boyfriend had the #1 Pho. The soup was most disappointing part.",

I asked for sauce because it wasn't on my table and they gave me extra stuff and asked me was I fine. I was just thrilled to find food that I was used to eating on the west coast so close to my house. I have no complaints and if I ever go back to visit friends I will be sure to stop buy and get pho and of course pick up some stuff from Mekong.",

I think they have the same price range. But I have to actually put some spices on my pho to get something out of the food. I think they get a lot of people because it s convenient on those who just visited the market place.   If you thinking of phone I can't recommend this place. Its very forgettable.",

I love pho, and usually I am not picky about broth, but I felt the broth here was really flavorless. on top of that, the beef was pretty tough. and for $8/bowl, I wasn't feeling it.  the positives are that the servers are friendly (although a little too pushy - when my friend asked what drinks they had, the server turned to the back of the menu and insisted on reading through every single item; also we were asked 4 different times what drinks we wanted; AND 4 different times if we were ready to order). also they give you plenty of bean sprouts, mint, and lime for your pho. and it is clean.",

    "text": "Truly unPhogettable but in a bad way.  We can't believe this place considers their items as Vietnamese food.   Ordered a special rice dish combo to go, they didn't give us the soup that came with it. When I asked for it they said \"oh you wanted the soup?\" Well, I paid for it didn't I? It's part of the combo isn't it?   Opened it when I got home and I was so disappointed. For close to $12 we were given the equivalent of cafeteria food.   \"Thit Nuong\" is supposed to be BBQ'd meat/pork. Cooked over an open flame, this seems microwaved. The veggies that came with it are lacking so much. You usually get red/green leaf lettuce at an authentic Viet place, here they search you iceberg, same with their springrolls.   I come from Santa Ana (Little Saigon) in Southern Cali. The worst spot there is 10 levels above this place.   The place right across from them is delicious. It costs about 10% more but they are indeed authentic and the food is genuine.   This place is the equivalent to Taco Bell for Mexican food.   They skimp on quality ingredients and serve food that barely qualifies as traditional Vietnamese.  If you want real authentic Pho and Viet food drive to Phoenix on 43rd st. There you will find the most amazing Vietnamese food and the cost is 25% - 35% less than this place.  There's a nice Viet place inside the food court there at Meekong plaza. They are $9 a dish and they do it right.  Please explore all your options. We will never eat here again.",

The smell in the room ruined the meal for me. I would later find that this is how the entire strip mall smells, unfortunately. I think the restaurant is over priced; the bowl of pho was $12 and my drink was $4. Their bahn mi's are $12 meanwhile the top rated bahn mi restaurant in the valley is located in the same plaza only charges $4 per sandwich. Next time I'm in the area I'll try another restaurant.",

The name really hooked me in, it's so catchy and punny- I am all about the puns.   But I was truly disappointed throughout my meal. Staff overall were not very friendly and unattentive, despite the fact that the restaurant was not busy at all. My friends all ordered the Pho - which they said was adequate. I was feeling different and decided to order my favorite, banh canh cua. Now this dish is not very hard to mess up, but when the bowl came out - it was ALL broth. A huge bowl of broth, with sunken mini pile of noodles, one small piece of pork and two shrimp. This was IT! For the description on the menu, something along the lines of seafood soup with vietnamese udon....this was hardly fitting.   I figured, okay maybe the portions are just small. I took my first sip of the broth, and already my experience continued to get worse. The broth was practically hot WATER. Pretty tasteless, no flavor besides the fact that it was red color, I wonder where they got that from since it did not taste like anything. There were kinda floating tiny pieces of crab throughout the broth but they were so small, you barely had any. I'm midway through my soup, forcing myself to eat it since I was starving...and then I found a PIECE OF PLASTIC in the soup. Clear plastic, a piece as big as my finger....wonder how they were able to miss that putting in my bowl but also shame on me for eating half my bowl and not realizing it. Maybe because all they gave me was broth, and it was just lost in this soup.   I ordered some summer rolls to go in case I got hungry, since I did not have much for lunch. And those were even more disappointing than the soup if you can imagine that. Peanut sauce tasted like they just stirred some peanut butter together and put it in a cup. The roll was hard, and chewy beyond measure. It was tough, and the noodles wrapped inside were definitely not cooked all the way. Meat inside the roll was tough. The whole roll was tough - TOUGH TO EAT!!   Did not enjoy this place, and to say the least - this restaurant was definitely unPHOgettable for me -________-",

Our server was very friendly, as well as the rest of the staff.   My friend ordered the Steak Pho and I ordered the Shrimp Pho and Shrimp Spring Rolls. Everything came out pretty quick, the spring rolls and then the pho. The food was really great; good tasting broth, 6-8 pieces of shrimp, and all the other good stuff.  Price was not bad either, we spent just around $30.   I think this might be my new go-to spot for pho! Hope you guys get the chance to enjoy",

This place had the most outstanding service of any place, pho or otherwise, that I've been to, especially on a packed Friday evening. Quick table, ordering, and constantly making sure I was doing good. It took a little longer for the pho, but when it's a packed house, it's understandable. They seemed to work quick and hard there, even fixing up some messed up orders at the table next to me.  Had a typical pho tai, which was served already in the broth. Again, understandable to help ease health concerns, but still trying to find a place where I can cook it to my liking. The broth is as the other reviewers have said: flavorless. I had to mix in other condiments, but I did like their version of sriracha. Price point was also a negative as well.  Overall, it was a fine place, with the only dings being the price and bland broth, but the service really makes me like being there. I would definitely be open to future visits.",

The broth is a bit spicer than most pho places but I really like it. Plus the price and portion size is great. The only thing preventing this from being 5 stars is that I wasn't a fan of the Thai iced tea with shaved ice in it and or wasn't a strong enough flavor for me.   The customer service is great very helpful, attentive and get your food quickly. The owner is also a very nice guy who talks to everyone making sure things are enjoyable. What really stood out is that after going in once he remembered me and that we had talked about yelp. It was only a minute or two conversation but when I came in a week or so later he remembered. That is just unbeatable when it comes to remembering customers and showing appreciation towards them.   This is a place I will be coming to again and again",

I really appreciate the freshness of their food and recognize that they do not cut corners on their ingredients. Their broths are WONDERFULLY flavorful. I usually choose a vegetarian dish and my husband likes seafood. We eat here at least once a week and have never been disappointed. Do try a Vietnamese dessert for a fun and delicious experience.  (BTW, they cater to those who must follow a gluten free diet).  The decor is attractive: a lot of windows, black and white photography, pendant lamps, two flat screened televisions on mute, American music at an unobtrusive volume, and what I really like --- the place is exceedingly clean, including the bathrooms!   The owners of Unphogettable are a married couple, who work very hard and have the most hospitable personalities. They not only make the environment pleasant for their guests, but have  created a good working atmosphere, as is evidenced by the happiness of their employees.   In closing, I couldn't be more enthusiastic in my recommendation of Unphogettable.",

Only complaint is that the spring rolls are kinda small, but that's it. A bowl of pho ranges around $7-8, so price is pretty average. But as far an quantity, you will get plenty of beef, there's no skimping of meat in that area. The broth used is flavorful and has great aroma.   The owners seem like they really pride themselves in their food and service, and that to me is a good sign that they are always front and center of what's going on.I like how it's in the middle of the Mekong plaza, so I can get a bunch of shopping and lunch in while I'm in the area.

Service was fine here, although I could have used a water refill toward the end and they never came back by.  I ordered the meatball pho and the server asked if I'd ever had it before. I thought that was a little weird, but answered in the affirmative. It did make me wonder if there was something off about it, but it was all fine.  I did NOT care for the taste or texture of the meatballs when they came out. They were very thick cut and really chewy in the center. Did not work for me at all.  I also thought the Pho could've been skimmed a little better, but some places do it better than others, so not too big of a deal.  Overall, I thought it was an okay experience.

Granted it's not the best, lets face it, this is Arizona, the hotbed of Vietnamese cuisine, right?  Told by people in the know that this is the best they have and that if I'm in need to come here. Yes I was in needs. Hungover and feeling like a penny I looked like I just spend 40 days in the desert instead of 40 hours in the city.  Went with my standard spring rolls and large pho with extra tripe and meatballs, no tendon or flank. Soup was clean of debris from the parboil. Not oily slicked, but to me could use a deeper degree of coriander and spices. Noodles were looks and not packed at the bottom, plenty of room to mix and generous condiments. Spring rolls were tight, light, but could use more noodles. Peanut sauce could have the crumbled peanuts be more pronounced. Light on the fish sauce. An excellent meal.  I was surprised they had a sister store in Virginia Beach, soo far from Arizona.   The next day, same sob story, hurting from the night before I treid the Mi Vit Tiem, roasted duck leg soup, earthy, not gamey, rich and flavorful, but didn't have the same effect as my beloved pho. Kind of classy.   Service is great, totally family run. Prices are average, parking is stripmall ish and plenty. The Vietnamese coffee was the only real downfall. Kind of weak in my opinion. Just thick and I had to ask for extra ice. Not bad for Arizona.  Love how they open at 9am, but close really early between 8-8:30.",

We ordered with the second server. 35 min later we had to ask about our food. 5 min later we were notified that our order had been \"lost\" . I explained to the server that we were not going to wait. She looked confused about why we wanted to leave. Bummer that we didn't get to eat!",

    "text": "Phogettable is more like it.  This was not our first time but it's been quite a long time and we definitely forgot about it.  My first impression was the ridiculous prices.  This place is in an Asian strip mall with so many other competitions nearby.  It would only make sense if the portion was large and food was good or if it was a specialty item you couldn't get anywhere else.  None of the above.    We ordered egg rolls for appetizers and the 4 egg rolls were extremely tiny for $7!  Plus it comes with iceberg instead of the traditional green/purple lettuce.  Banh mi was $11 which was ridiculous considering the fact that you can get one for $4 at a real banh mi shop a few doors down.  I ordered a rice plate thinking it was probably the best bang for the buck since it would fill me up but that wasn't the case ($13).  For around the same price, the rice place next door would have at least been more fulfilling.  My husband ordered the wonton soup without egg noodles and it only came with 5 wontons and some seafood for $13.  Wontons tasted like it was freezer burned.  A cup of dessert (Che) was $4 and it was 75% filled with ice.  My husband was so upset.  No one in our party was satisfied.    For a party of 5 + a baby, the bill was almost $100.  They automatically charge an 18% gratuity for service that was non-existent.  It should not be this expensive to eat Vietnamese food.  There are so many other good restaurants in the area that charge much less for better quality food.  The only reason we went here was because our favorite Viet place was closed.  If you want real Vietnamese food, go to Pho Thuan Than or Pho 43.  I'm so surprised by the good reviews here.  We left hungry and disappointed.  Will never eat here again.  Save your money!",

They made sure that we are taken care of at all times, and the service is really quick. I ordered their #1 pho with the tripe, steak, brisket, flank and meatballs. They have a good amount of meat in there and the soup is sooooo gooooooood. I love thai tea so I ordered some from there as well but sadly, I was disappointed. The thai tea tasted really bland that I was barely able to finish it. The price is not bad at all! I paid for my friend and I, and together with the thai tea, I spent less than $30.   All in all this restaurant is a great place, it has a great atmosphere, and great food! Definitely will be one of my go to place for pho whenever I am craving it. :)",

I was not a fan of the pork, as the sauce they cooked it in was too much and too sweet. The grilled chicken spring rolls again were delicious. We subbed the noodles in them for the pickled carrot daikon/radish veggies, and they definitely hit the spot. Would come back to try again.",

    "text": "I tell you what me and my wife love Vietnamese food. Not too greasy, fairly healthy with an Asian flair. To be honest I have never been to unPhogettable. This is one of my son's favorite places.   We walk in and it's not fancy at all. No hostess stand or anything. Just stand in the front and one of the waitresses or waiters will seat you. There is no wow factor to the ambiance but just \"Let's Eat\" mentality.   We started off with the Spring Roll which had Shrimp & Pork, the Summer Roll which has Pork Sausage, and the Autumn Roll which has Egg & Shrimp. Our group was pretty big so I was only able to try the Summer roll and Autumn roll. My favorite was the Summer roll. This was so fresh. The rice paper was fresh. Loved the grilled pork sausage. I don't know what it was but something in the middle was crunchy. This was so good. So different. Really liked it a lot compared to the normal spring rolls we get at other Vietnamese restaurants. The Autumn roll with egg and shrimp was good. Very fresh ingredients. So the spring rolls are very good.  I ordered the Combo Plate with pork and chicken. Both the pork and chicken is very thin. Marinated in a sweet sauce. Very well cooked. Very tasty. Very fresh. Really liked it. Not dry at all but juicy. It hits the right spot. They give you white rice, egg roll, and vinegar based lettuce and carrots. Really good meal. Really enjoyed it.  My wife went away from her norm and got Rice noodle soup with special beef stew. She really liked it. The stew had a little kick to it and I was surprised she liked it cause she usually doesn't like anything with a kick to it. The beef stew meat was very tender and very good.   The service is ok. They take your order, fill your water cups, and take away dishes once your done. There is no small talk. No personality to the servers. Just do their job and let get going. Even my mom said it seems like they just want to serve you and get you out as soon as possible. It's what it is and I have noticed this in other Asian run businesses. Not a big deal to me but for others be aware.   So I would say really great food. Very fresh. Very creative. Very good with adequate service and not much ambiance. Just very good food at decent prices. Can't ask for much more than that.   Will we be back? Of course since this is one of my son's favorite places and of course their food. Enjoy.",

They have a quite a few different options on the menu and different plates to pick from.   We ended up getting one kids chicken pho with rice noodles, one chicken pho, one seafood pho, and a grilled fish dish that came with a small salad and rice.   The pho's came out quickly and the fish plate came out a few minutes later. My chicken pho was just decent. The broth could've been better and it definitely lacked flavor. There were about 5 pieces of chicken in my bowl for $9.95.  The seafood pho had two pieces of shrimp, two pieces of calamari, and two pieces of shrimp cake. This was $10.95. Really wish it would have had more shrimp....   The fish plate had a small serving of white rice and a small salad. The fish though, was decently sized and it tasted good.   There was no soy sauce or forks at the table so we had to hunt down the waitress. She did come around for refills though and she did check up on us a few times.   We spent $45 for two regular sized phos, one grilled fish plate, one lemonade, and one kids chicken pho.   I wasn't too impressed with the pho as I've definitely had better tasting broth. They were also kind of skimpy with the meats. I've been to other places where they give you a lot more meat and the phos even cheaper. Maybe will be back if in the area.",

The staff here honestly doesn't speak at all, not even basic etiquette...   I took a peek at the menu and I was very astonish at how much they charge for a bowl of slice beef pho. 9.95 is probably the most ridiculous price ever. If they are going to charge a ridiculous price for pho, at least make it good. Their pho is so horrible. The broth tasted old and it tasted like they pour chicken broth into their pho or something.. I also tried a little of my wife's dry noodles and I can't believe they call themselves a chef here. The noodles has no taste, the chicken was dry, the fish tasted old, and there was no sauce to the dry noodles...   Seriously that will be my last time there. 9.95 for a bowl of pho that's not even pho and the horrible service... no thank you....",

I ordered the house fried rice with extra \"meat\". He explained to me how really great fried rice is cooked by hearing it, rather than watching it. He said it had to \"POP\" like popcorn, and that's why theirs is really light and fluffy and NOT greasy at all. He was so right. Some of the best fried rice I've ever had.  I went again a few days later and got another order, it was that good. He recommended I order it next time with my choice of grilled meat on the side because it has it's own sauce and it caramelizes and it's so yummy.  Looking forward to trying more things here.   Bottom line though, good food plus friendly service is a win any day.",

Let me start by saying I don't have much experience with Vietnamese cuisine, but my overall experience of unPhoGettable was fun.  The lack of appetizers do put a bit of a damper on the meal, but not a huge one. My boyfriend and I started off with the fried egg rolls. These were full of flavor and the lettuce I received was chilled, crisp (unlike the other reviewer) and was served with pickled veggies and a sweet sauce for dipping. I'm IN. The owner of the restaurant went over the entire menu for us, told us the most popular dishes and really pointed out the pros and cons of each dish. I went with the Pho w/ brisket. My boyfriend got the Pho with all the meats in there. It came with bean sprouts and basil on the side. I was stuffed by the time I left. I couldn't believe how much food was in that bowl. There was no way any one person can finish off a bowl of soup like that.   Give this little place a chance.",

UnPhogettable definitely fits this description, hands-down my favorite pho place EVER.  The menu is big, a really nice selection, but I have to admit that, despite visiting every couple weeks, I continue to order the same thing...the sliced pork bun with egg rolls is just TOO GOOD to pass up.  It's a wonderful cross between a hot rice noodle dish and a salad: fresh, refreshing, satisfying and flavorful.  The quality is typical of the rest of the menu...this place is consistent and reliable.  The portions are perfect...for two meals!  (I've discovered that most reheat well for lunch the next day).  I have almost finished the bun once, an accomplishment I am truly proud of.  The atmosphere is really friendly...hip and modern-trendy, with informal seating at long tables, very relaxed.  The restaurant is very clean, and is a part of the Mekong Plaza shopping complex...so you've got an awesome Asian market to roam through after lunch.  The staff are very attentive, and the owners are FANTASTIC - super-friendly, great sense of humor, and even remember my favorite order (which is pretty good with the number of customers they get!).  I never can believe the check when it comes, either...incredible amount of food for the price.  If you like pho and bun, this place will compare favorably with anything you've had anywhere else.  IF YOU'VE NEVER HAD IT, are you in for a treat!  Give this a shot, you will not be disappointed!",

Situated in the Mekong Plaza, the restaurant is attached an Asian market (which I wanted to explore after our meal!) and has an authentic feel to it.  We were promptly seated at a long communal table (different, but we didn't mind) and we ordered hot jasmine tea before we delved into the expansive menu.    The tea was perfect and didn't have any jasmine leaves floating it (at Pho An Sen I was slighly irritated by this)--definitely my kind of tea.  We ordered the spring rolls with shrimp and pork to start.  I loved the warm tender shrimp and the crisp, fresh veggies.  They were served with peanut dipping sauce, and we experimented with the three sauces that were on our table (red chili sauce, hoisin sauce, sriacha).    The menu was organized by broth: beef-based, chicken and pork-based, and regional flavors.  The server (I think he was the owner) asked if it was our first time eating Pho and took the time to explain the flavors of all of the broths.  I decided on the Pho with sliced chicken breast (it was listed under the beef-based section, although it was more of a rich chicken broth), and ordered it with bok choi, mushrooms, and broccoli.  It came with a side of fresh bean sprouts, jalapeno, lime and basil.  The broth was complex, yet it had clarity to it.  It wasn't too oily (I HATE greasy-tasting Pho) and the chicken was lean.  Our server even showed us how to make the perfect dipping sauce (half hoisin, half sriacha and a squeeze of lime).   My friend ordered the beef-based #3.  It was spiced perfectly, came out piping hot and wasn't loaded with fatty meat.  He ordered slices of rare beef on the side, which were very lean and incredibly tasty.    On taste and service alone, I would have given unPhogettable five stars.  However, they closed at 9 on a Saturday night, and began to close up shortly after.  One of the waitresses propped open the door to shake out all of their floor mats.  This pissed me off because it was rainy and COLD outside, and it made both me and my Pho cold.  They started mopping and stacking the chairs before we even had a chance to pay.  It was like we were inconveniencing them for lingering at their restaurant.  This is one thing I HATE.  Paying customers have the right to linger as long as they want after a meal, even if it's for merely 10 minutes after closing time.",

    "text": "I went here today during the New Years celebration at the Vietnamese cultural center and I was really impressed on every front.  Service - The service was really friendly and they considerate for our 3 year old daughter. Appetizers came out rapidly and the main courses (pho for me and the mother in law, bun for my wife) came out at exactly the right time with genuine smiles.  Food - On the outside I was smiling, on the inside I was having a \"When Harry met Sally\" moment! I had the Pho with vegetables and rare steak. IT WAS AWESOME. The steak arrived rare within the Pho, but within a few minutes the hot liquid had gently cooked the steak throughout.  The pho was just a little bit salty (not bad though) so go easy on drinking it at the end but it created the perfect balance for flavouring the noodles and vegetables within it.  In hindsight, even though I'm sensitive to salty food I wouldn't have have changed a thing since the beef broth flavor infused into the ingredients so well.   FOOD ALLERGIES:  I'm always concerned about MSG in my food since I'm allergic to it and my wife and daughter are allergic to gluten. Well, we had no problems here. After we were done we were chatting to the owner and he was explaining their philosophy on cooking. They prepare everything from scratch with no MSG or artificial ingredient including the pho soup base and the fish ball and beef meatballs. He was explaining that the fish balls are simply flaked fish that's mixed with spices then reformed into balls (same for the beef balls too). He said he has a special technique for this that not everyone can master without adding fillers such as bread and that not everyone can do it. Who am I to argue? all I know is that next time I go I'll be ordering them.  Prices: $7.50 to $8.25 for main meals  Overall: Bloody Brilliant!",

MY usual Pho place was closed and I needed Pho to help me recover from the night before... So here I went with my kids.  Walking in was pleasant We got greeted, seated, and menus in hand.  I didn't like that they did not give my son a menu, he can read his 13.  Anyways we started out with the egg rolls and I got  Pho with meat and  my son got the chicken breast with rice and a child's pho for my little girl.  When the egg rolls came I was like WTH really iceberg lettuce to wrap my egg rolls : ( . Not impressed . Then it took awhile for our soups and entree to come out and when it arrived... DISAPPOINTMENT!!! Now everybody should  know that the broth is what matters and it tasted like chicken/beef broth, the beansprouts and basil looked sad.  The basil looked like it was picked over. My sons chicken didn't look like a chicken breast.  It looked like they took half of the breast and half it again then smash it flat.  it was too sweet and uneatable. The service is good and the food is Phogettable.",

    "text": "This was my first time trying pho, but I wasn't impressed. I ordered the seafood pho and it had two pieces of shrimp in it. The broth was very flavorful but the lack of seafood was disappointing. The main reason why I am giving this place one star is because the owner takes the tips from the servers. I read a review on Yelp with this information, and confirmed it with the server when we arrived. There are also two cameras in the restaurant, I assume to ensure that the very nice and efficient girl who helped us wouldn't be slipped anything without the owner's knowledge. This kind of practice is pathetic and unacceptable to me. Tips are for servers who work hard, not for the owner to steal. I did not leave a tip and will not return, as I will not support this unethical business practice. Please consider this if you choose to visit Unphogettable.",

    "text": "This is the first time we had eatten Pho and did not really know what to expect or for that matter what it really was.  Turns out it is broth, noodles, some veggies and different types of beef or chicken or seafood, but you probably already knew that. I had the number 1 (can't remember what it was called).  It was a beef broth with noodles and I added the veggies.  It had beef brisket, flank steak, beef tripe and tendon and beef meatballs.  It sounds like a lot but trust me it wasn't.  I mean there was a lot of noodles and broth but the meat and veggie portions were extremely skimmpy.  (Hence the 3 star rating)  The meat was also a little on the bland side but if you mixed the hot sauces in with it, it tasted better.  My girlfriend had the number 9 which included beef brisket and flank steak.  She also thought the same as I, but for some reason hers had an almost overpowering taste of cinnimon.  The service was beyond great and the lady that was either the owner or manager came to our table and talked to us for a few minutes.  She explained everything and also gave us suggestions.  We also had the soft spring rolls as an appetizer.  One thing I didn't expect was that they were served cold.  I think that we will probably go back and try it again but order something different.",

After visiting just about every place in Scottsdale and the surrounding area they settled on a new favorite. unPhogettable is a clean and modernly decorated mini-mall storefront. For those of you who aren't familiar Pho it's an incredibly flavorful Thai soup that's actually pretty healthy, depending on the preparation and cuts of meat you decide on. This particular place boasts they're MSG and trans-fat free.  When it came time to order I left it up to our the pros, our hosts, and was so pleased with their recommendations. We started with the Soft Spring Rolls, fresh and simple ($3.45) and Egg Rolls (fried to perfection and accompanied by a tangy sauce ($4.95). My entree was a GIGANTIC bowl of Pho with rare steak (a value at $7.50). I could only eat about half of my portion and that was pushing it. So good.  The only thing better was the service. They were incredibly attentive.",

    "text": "This place will leave you unphogettable, whether it be good or bad.  I have visited this place 4 times now.  First trip: with my wife and daughter. Food was good, egg rolls good, then main course. It took 20 minutes for then to bring us 1 pho (for my wife), and 1 rice vermicelli with pork (only dish I ever eat). My dish was good, and seemed like the portion was big, until my pork disappeared and the only thing left was lettuce. I think they included a small head of lettuce, little bit of noodles, and a tiny amount of meat.  Second trip: by myself since my wife delivered our second baby girl, and I wanted to surprise her with comfort food. Ordered a chicken Pho, and kids chicken Pho (for my daughter) to go. Server girl tells me that they do not make kids pho to go. Now I'm mad, but don't want to make a scene. I ask if I can get a side of noodles to go, in which she says \"yes\". I ask if I can get a small side of pho soup to go, in which she says \"yes\". Chicken? \"yes\" I'm thinking WTF is different from child's pho than what I ordered? Took my order and left no tip due to her stupidity!  Third trip: with my wife, mom, and our now two daughters. Pretty much same order as first trip, but my mom ordered same as me. My wife, being Vietnamese didn't learn English until her late teens, always orders in Vietnamese (hey we are in a Vietnamese restaurant right?). I guess either the server we had didn't know Vietnamese, or was of a different nationality because no matter what my wife said, she ignored my wife and kept asking \"what number?\" Again my food (and my moms) was pretty much a whole head of lettuce, little noodles, and little meat.  Fourth trip: with my wife, our two daughters, my mom, and my moms husband. Almost same order as last time, but I ordered rice vermecilli with beef, my mom and my wife order it with pork, and my step father orders pho. All of our food comes out, and again a whole head of lettuce, bla bla bla. But wait, my wife's food is not here, and the server is at the othe side of the place laughing and chatting with friends. Everyone is pretty much finished, and still no food for my wife. I go get the server and tell her that my wife didn't get her food. She comes over and tells my wife that she is not sure what happened. She goes to the kitchen, then comes back and says she forgot to order it for us, but put it in now. My wife tells her \"okay, please remember it needs to be Pork.  A little bit later the server brings her rice vermecilli with beef. My wife tells her \"I ordered Pork, and I reminded you that it was pork\".  The server tells my wife \"no, you order beef. I heard you say beef\". Then almost at the same time, my mom and I tell her very loudly \"I ORDERED BEEF, AND IT WAS OVER 30 MINUTES AGO!!!\".  So now the server is just standing there mumbling something, but does not offer to fix it or anything, she just keeps standing there.  So my mom says she will eat the beef, and we will take the rest home and add pork to it for my wife.  As I dump it into a to go box, my wife says \"wow, that must be a whole head of lettuce there\". Finally I was not the only one to notice. My mom offered to pay, and as we were walking out, the owner says \"do you want me to replace meat with pork?\"  Even though the food was descent tasting, we will never go back there again after those repeated experiences.  Their horrible service deffinately makes them unphogettable, but in a bad way.",

So moving to Arizona, I had to leave that behind and settle for wannabe Viet restaurants and whatnot.  So when I found unPhogettable, I shuttered to see a pho restaurant title without a number after it and incorporating a terrible pun that makes my teeth grind.  But I walked inside and hey! It SMELLS like a good pho restaurant! =)  Ordered a bowl of pho tai and it was pretty decent! The broth they make is surprisingly flavor and they somehow use less MSG and fats than their Californian counterparts without sacrificing flavor. So that was a very pleasant surprise for me.  One problem is that the pho is slightly overpriced compared to CA. But if pho is what you're craving, this is the place to stop! ^_^",

The service was quick but the servers we short & rude. I ordered the pho with everything. This place may be called unphogettable but my pho was very phogettable. It was under average & the prices are the most expensive that I've seen in Phoenix. I will not be coming here for pho again.",

The restaurant is attached to the Mekong Plaza.  On this lovely evening, I had the #1, and I had the rare steak on the side. The staff had no problem accomodating my request. The Spring (actually Autumn) rolls were phenom in the peanut sauce. Try it. You'll like it.  Everything is fresh. I don't have any complaints about this place. At least none that I would Yelp about.   The Pho is phantastic (see what I did there?). The broth comes out at the perfect temperature, and there are enough bean sprouts and basil leaves for your palate.   The name is cute. Duh.",

    "text": "Not only was my Pho here unforgettable, it was no doubt pholicious! This particular Vietnamese dish is one of my all-time staples that I cannot live without!    As usual, I always order a bowl that includes \"rare\" steak, meatballs, and beef brisket while stuffing it with all the fresh veggies that normally comes with it, like the sprouts, Asian/mint leaves, and squeeze of lemon.  Interestingly, they did not have cilantro! Maybe they ran out? Hopefully that was the case, because it is a MUST! Lastly, I like to drizzle hoisin to give it a more rich sweet taste and the universal hot sauce that seriously can be put in just about anything, Siracha! Voila, I'm ready to slurp away!  The steak, meatballs and beef brisket were soft and tender, the way it always should be.  I thought the broth was quite good--the level of saltiness was balanced and tasted smooth. The broth is the key to a great Pho! if you do not agree, I would like to hear from you! :)  The noodles themselves, I thought were also really good actually.  I do not normally comment on the noodles because I always thought they tend to be \"standard\" and the same across the board.  Not in this case.  It was prepared perfectly and had an aromatic tasting hint to it--you do not want soggy noodles EVER!  I cannot go further without discussing the etiquettes of slurping Pho.  At this particular time, I happened to notice across me, two tables down to my left, a couple eating Pho, in probably the most bizarrest, unorthodox kind of way.  #1, who splits a Pho bowl?! To me that's a NO, NO.  To make this sound even more disturbing, they either slurped all the broth already or they dumped it out onto another bowl.  My good eyes saw that it looked like only the solid ingredients were left over.  Both people basically chopsticked their meat and noodles out onto their plate, A PLATE! Then, after that, they would examine their pieces of meat and it appeared like they were picking it apart or something and then devouring whatever they thought looked good???  To properly eat Pho, all you do is using either a fork or chopstick, grab your noodle and meat/veggies (bare minimum) and try to fit it into your Asian spoon.  After that's done, you may slurp away.  I like to take it a step further by also scooping the broth into the spoon so I can get the full taste.  For once, I have exhausted my brain and fingers typing this review. *sigh*",

But no, this restaurant really lives up to it's name   The mom and I came here before grocery shopping inside Mekong. The staff were really friendly and speedy in taking orders. It did take a while for our pho's to come out but they say it's because they make everything in order of ticket. Made to order pho?? I can't complain.  Meanwhile, it being our first time there, we decided to indulge in their spring rolls. There was nothing but shrimp, lettuce and noodle in the roll but surprisingly, flavorful.   We get the pho. The soup tastes clean and fresh. There seemed to be lots of cilantro in it which I LOVEEEED and my mom loved how it didnt taste like they poured in MSG. Large portion of noodles, lots of meat, and clean bean sprouts!! Perfect for a hungry stomach. Definitely unPHOgettable =p",

Fresh sprouts and greens on the side with a couple slices of pepper and a lime, some great chili sauce and a bit of bean curd sauce on the side - bam. Fantastic service; talked to the owner for a moment and he informed us that they're open all day on the same shift of workers, all of whom were kind and knowledgable (not to mention being on the ball refilling my diet coke).

Finally I found a place within 15 min of my house to go get some especially to cure the mighty hangover.    The Pho was voted best dish in 2009 here and I can see why.  The broth was full of flavor and the meat was a generous portion and on my order of Pho Tai it actually was rare as it was served to me unlike many other Pho places where it is already cooking in the broth and far from rare upon arrival to me.    The menu had many options on it besides just Pho and I ordered my usual Vietnamese egg rolls which were great as well.  They had shrimp in them so it was a nice seafood twist to the usual pork rolls.    Overall it is a great place to cure your Pho need or cure that hangover.  The only thing preventing it from being a 5 star is that it borders the grocery store and doesn't really capture that separate restaurant vibe it should.",

Compared to all the other places in the pheonix/glendale area I've been to, this is probably the best pho place and it's about 30 min from where I live.   It's not as good as the pho in the bay area, but it tastes close enough. The servers are really nice and the restaurant is clean which is a plus, since most pho places that taste really good are kind of dirty, and mom and pop-like, similar in Vietnam.   Since I'm vietnamese, it works in my favor ( I feel like I get more food and more quickly too). We came in a huge group and they reserved a table for us (unlike most vietnamese places which get you in and out as quickly as possible!) Most of us got pho, we shared spring rolls, and some others got bbq rice plates and bun bo hue (Spicy beef noodle). They even brought out the special onions to put in the pho (by request only). I think some got the special desserts and liked them as well. We all left really happy and most of us are from california so we know what good pho is ;)",

The owner came by our table personally to apologize for our 5 minute wait for a table and he stayed behind to make small talk with my little girl about her Little Mermaid doll that she had with her.  I thought he was really friendly and gracious and he definitely made this the most friendly Vietnamese restaurant I've ever dined at in the Valley.  The food was extremely delicious.  I got the Bo Kho soup and it was fantastic; hot, meaty and flavorful.  My husband had a vegetarian stir fry and my son got the vegetarian Pho and they both loved their dishes as well.  My little daughter also really enjoyed her fried spring rolls and her fresh, young coconut drink that comes served in a glass, along with the coconut meat and a serving spoon.  This restaurant is a little farther from me than I would like, but I'll definitely try to make it a regular stop when I am over in this part of the Valley.",

The menu was very easy to read, and there is a variety of main ingredient dishes to chose from (chicken, beef, pork and vegetarian options like tofu). Minus one star because the service was ehh- the waitresses weren't exactly \"warm\" if you know what I mean. Overall, the food was ridiculously good. I would recommend this place to anyone eating to try pho for the first time or to an experienced pho eater.",

Located in Mekong Plaza inside the supermarket, which can be crazy during the weekend, this is really a great location for a pho restaurant.  There are several LCDs for your viewing pleasure.  I really loved the painted bamboo murals on the walls and the contrasting taupe wall with some dark red in other areas.  The decor here is nice compared to other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to.  Very modern-esque.  Another plus, is the recess lighting over the tables which adds a better ambiance to the restaurant.  I am a fan of modernized restaurants especially Asian ones because back home, I'm accustomed to white walls and non-fancy decor.   But even with awesome decor and ambiance, the food was just ok.  I've had better and I think it's just gimmicky.    Food here is a bit pricier, but I guess that's what you're paying for.",

The walls feature murals of bamboo and pretty, artistic photos of women wearing traditional Vietnamese dresses.    The place is family-owned and on several of our visits, the owners have come and chatted at length with us--very nice people!  They WILL remember you.  Being vegetarian, I recommend the veggie pho (selection V4 on the menu), which is like a tofu/veggie explosion in a soup bowl; it has mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, snow peas, bok choy, cabbage, and tofu plus the bean sprouts/lime/jalapenos that come alongside.  Really fresh and good!  I also love the vegetarian egg rolls--they're unique in that they come with lettuce and pickled veggies to wrap around them--they're my favorite egg rolls I've ever had hands down!  Recommend this place highly!",

There are lots of community tables to sit at when you walk in. This makes for a kinda noisy restaurant but I certainly don't mind it at all. There are some smaller tables available as well. From the outside it's a strip mall but the decor inside is quite nice and not what you would expect!  The menu has a good selection of a variety of Pho, egg noodle and regional soups, vermicelli salads, entrees and appetizers. I've had the summer and autumn rolls with peanut sauce and they are fresh, crisp and delish every time. They are filled just right, not too much yet not to skimpy. The veggies and meats taste like they had just been put together, which is just as it should be. While I don't like too much peanut sauce, I do like it here as it's not too sticky and sweet. I've also tried the pho and it is great! While they are very flexible and offer a variety of ingredients for the pho it is the broth that really stands out. It's savory and well balanced, you can taste the beef and spices and it's wonderful. I love love the lingering star anise taste in every spoonful.  Know that you can pick up take out here and they package it very very well!",

I have tried my fare share of pho, at a handful of different across the valley, and although their restaurant may be nicer than most the pho does not compare to some of the places in the West Valley   Their service is amazing, just as everyone said and their coffee is also great!",

For one, I wasn't a fan of the huge long communal like tables in the middle of the restaurant.  We got there when it was really busy and had to sit at one.  I just like my own space!  Plus, I am fairly sure they didn't have any AC, so it was really getting warm with all that hot soup and warm bodies packed in there.    We had attentive servers and the food came out quickly, but I wasn't wowed.  The Pho Bien (meatball) was served in a mediumish size bowl (only one size) with my own personal plate of herbs and sprouts (which was nice).  The pho was swimming in grease.  It is a personal pet peeve when places don't skim!!  The meatballs where quartered (I generally like them thinly sliced).  The problem with quartering a meatball is if it sits all day in broth cooking it will get rubbery, as these did. Other than that the broth was good.    Pho is like pizza, even bad pho is pretty good. I would say is was OK.  It just didn't do much for me.",

I also love the Bun, especially the Bun bo Nuong (grilled beef), during the summer when I want something cooler and refreshing.  The tables are, for the most part, family style.  You may find yourself sitting next to someone you haven't met before.  Everything is clean and well maintained, and the staff and owner are friendly.",

The soup arrived relatively fast and it came with a metric ton of fresh veggies as well as tofu. It was delicious!  The service was great - the servers were very attentive and friendly. I think 3 different people asked my husband if he needed a refill on his water.   I really liked this place and I'll definitely be back.",

I even checked Yelp and they actually got 4 stars so I was really happy to go.  I know Mekong market smells but I didn't think this pho place would smell also.  When we walked into this restaurant I almost puked.  I was waking into sewage/bathroom.  My husband said we can leave but I knew how hungry he was so I said it's okay.  I ordered their pho.  The bowl was huge with so much broth and so little meat and noodles.  They were even stingy with bean sprouts and herbs.  I was ill all night after I ate there.  I will not be returning.  Only good thing was their decor, it wasn't that bad.  Again I will not be returning.  I have habit of not eating at a restaurant that makes me puke all night long.  I did loose a pound though.",

My Sisser kept telling me about this place when I told her I want to try more. Well she brought me here the other day to get take out.  It had to be take out cuz we were doing showing off places we like order out dinner night, and I was getting her some beef chow fun for ACE on the other side of the road.  We got a ton of spring rolls and a salad.  They were so NICE to us while we ordered and waited for our food and when they brought it to us we ended up in a great conversation about the love of food and how much they care about what they are doing in their restaurant.  Very impressive.    We couldn't wait to get home to try it and we were starving so we started digging in on the way home... :)  I LOVED the salad, the spring rolls were also very good. The sausage one was my fav, I love the cilantro.  The sweet chili sauce was my fav. I usually love the peanut kind, but that was the only thing I didn't get wowwed by, it was good but not great.  I would still eat it often and enjoy it, I just know I have had better... but this is only for the peanut sauce, everything else was amazing!",

The price for dishes here are about $1-$2 higher than I'm use too.  Bun are good.  Pho was good though I like the soup to come out piping hot, and it never is.  It's hot, just not steaming hot like I'm use too.  Decor is nice and clean, servers are generally friendly.  Where this place fails is in the nickel and diming.  They charge extra for getting your steak rare on the side instead of being in the soup.  There's also extra charge for take out so I've stopped getting that here also.  Worse yet, they charge extra for extra fish sauce.... that's like a hamburger place charging extra for ketchup.  I could understand some of these charges if the prices of the dishes weren't also above average.  On general principal though, charging a premium for the dishes and than charging extra for little things that should be free means this place is a once or twice a year place instead of once or twice a week for me.",

Through the owner's lovely wife, I learned how to drink Vietnamese coffee properly!  You may think that's a ridiculous thing to say but it was very motherly, sweet, and completely unnecessarily.  It's the fact that she took the time out to come over and teach me all the finer details of Vietnamese coffee that made the lesson and experience memorable.  Not even my Vietnamese friends had taken the time out to teach me!  Now the food here is truly unforgettable.  I love the bun by far!  It's crisp, fresh, and always leaves me full but not uncomfortably so.  I love their egg rolls and their spring rolls and the rice dishes are always savory and flavorful.    I must admit though there is probably only *one* other place I'd rather go to get pho over this place [because they're cheaper, just as delicious, and portions are just as big], I give this place one more star than the other because they're just sooo sweet and nice here!  The service really makes that one-star difference.  The prices here are a bit higher than other Vietnamese restaurants but the quality and freshness of the ingredients makes up for it.    With the modern decor, delicious food, and great service, what's not to love?",

    "text": "Ok.... so first the good, very clean, great location, tons of options, friendly staff. All super important. So why the three stars??? Well, while the pho is good it is not mind blowing. It's everything pho should be and the portions of meat they give are very generous. But it's not that pho stock that wraps your soul in warmth.  The real issue I have is that they Nickel  and dime ya to death ( very unattractive in a restaurant) if you want your order to go, .50 if you want your rare steak on the side .50 if you want sliced onions on the side 1$....I get that these things take a little extra time, I've worked in restaurants for many years, but with soooooooo many choices when it comes to going out ( like 10 pho places with in 2 miles) these little extras should be included.  They add so much to the dinning experience, and are if given free would be so much more valuable then the .50 they pocket.  Would I come back?.... if I was in the area maybe.... would I seek it out? Nope.",

Spring rolls: they tasted fresh a little over priced 4.50 for only two. I didn't like the peanut sauce because they added coconut milk to it had a funny after taste.  I got the pho #2. Overall not bad we might come back because the restaurant was cleaner & decorated a little nicer  than most pho places. Service could be friendlier & overpriced for a pho place..",

When I sat down waited to order, I noticed most races other than Asians came in to eat...I started to have bad feelings about the place because with the experiences that I've encountered...almost 9 out of 10 pho restaurants that has more Americans or other races other than Asians eating means the place is not going to be good or only average. The reason is...Most Asians (often Vietnamese) knows their Pho so if the PHo is WHOA and worth it then definitely they will crowd up the place...(I am not hating or anything but this is indeed True) if u disagreed or dislike what u read, please move forward to someone's else review that fit your eyes   IMO if you're going to charge people overpriced food then you need to make it extremely good! Like out of the ordinary...  I am not a pro on food but I ate pho since I was a child and have tried tons of pho to know which ones taste good.  The pho here is not the worst but it ain't the best...it's average.   PHO GAN (PHO W/ TENDONS ONLY) ABOUT $9  PHO TAI (PHO w/ sliced beef) about $10 Bun thit nuong cha gio (rice noodle w/ pork meat & egg rolls) egg rolls were not cut...they gave only 1 full egg roll. About $10 something + $1 something for 1 egg roll...  The pho itself was cooked at the right level since it was soft to chew but not mushy.  Broth was clear and not oily...tendons was a bit rough (hard). It was a little difficult to bite a piece off so I had to put one whole piece in my mouth.  The sliced beef was somewhat thick...not thin enough but good thing it was fresh  The rice noodle was good...I tried a a piece of the pork and it was well marinated and not burnt up. Didn't eat the egg roll but it didn't looked tasty.  Services were eh...they mostly checked up on regular and old customers and due to the fact that most of the waitresses were not Asians...they only checked up on those who were not Asians...When asked them to bring something they weren't happy and were rushing to leave!

    "text": "(Lyrics - Nat King Cole - Unforgettable)  UnPhogettable, that's where I am UnPhogettable in Mekong Plaza Like a sauce that's fishy that clings to me How the taste of Pho does things to me Never before have I ate this much and more  UnPhogettable in every way Add basil's and lime, that's how I'll roll That's why, darling, it's incredible That some place like UnPhogettable  Thinks that I am UnPhogettable too!  UnPhogettable is one to remember when it comes to Pho restaurants.  Every ones trying to be creative and this one definitely catches the eye and ears.    UnPhogettable is located right at the entrance of Mekong Plaza, an Asian grocery store, which is a prime location.  One of the first to open around that area so kudos to jump and the wagon so quick.    I ordered the Pho of course and so did my friend.  Nice warm to hot broth is important to me and this place didn't disappoint.  The beef round is which I'm used to is not used here unfortunately.  Instead it's cut into a triangular shaped and much small portions.  Too bad, cause that would have been the way I liked it.  The side condiments came in a small saucer dish.  Now I can appreciate that cause I only use so much.  For those of you that loves a lot of basil, cilantro, jalapeno, and bean sprouts...you will be disappointed.    Overall, the Pho doesn't blow my mind, but it's okay.  Service hits with a bang and I enjoy the black t-shirt uniforms instilled here.  Most Pho restaurants don't even have uniforms. - Enjoy!",

I really wanted to try oxtail but that was not an option on the menu so I was a little disappointed. I felt like it was really American and not truly authentic. It had a nice sweet taste to it. Meat was tender. I like the Basile leaves they give you to put in the soup really tops off the flavore. I was just expecting more condiments to come with it. After my food was brought out I never saw the server agen till I waved some one down to get my check. Was a cool place to try happy I did I just wouldn't come back agen.",

It's very flavorful and it has lots of vegetables. It's a perfect summer dish for when it's hot outside and you don't want a piping hot bowl of pho!!! (Even though the pho is still good when it's hot out).",

To someone who has spent many hours consuming pho in the hidden corners of Little Saigon in the OC - this was a very pleasant surprise.  Clientele was solid mix of gringos and asians.  Phood was 3.5 stars.  Disappointed in our $5.75 spring rolls - which were 'stuffed' mostly with rice noodles and razor thin slices of sausage.  But on the plus side the menu includes a whole page of interesting 'regional' noodle soups - so there are some off the beaten path options if you want to stray from the pho options.  Plenty of sprouts and leaves served alongside - most noodle soups in the $9-$10 range.  Prices about 15% above where they should be - but for such a pleasant and friendly environment it's worth the extra few bucks.  Note hot tea here is $1.95...  Would have assigned 3 stars purely on phood and prices - but great,friendly staff and service make this a 4 star review.",

UnPhogettable's Pho is really good in general but I must emphasize how good the broth is! It's clean, no debris floating around, and full of robust flavor. If someone gave me a bowl of broth by itself I would be happy, but then you add the noodles, onions, and beef and you're in heaven. The ratio of meat and noodles to broth seems perfect, you can finish the whole bowl without feeling like your stomach is going to explode, totally satisfied. The meat alone is pretty tasty, I can't decide if the meatballs or steak is better. In addition, if you ever have a sore throat or are feeling sick, Pho is the way to go, it always makes me feel great.",

I always get a bowl of soup and a side of spring rolls . Delicious!! I was also very happy to find out that they have a kids menu. When I first started coming here I didn't have any kids but now I do and it makes it a lot easier than sharing my pho or ordering another and not being able to finish it . The only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because sometimes they don't really have great customer service skills . They don't say much to you and point at where you need to sit .  I always recommend this restaurant to people and I probably always will .",

They're not stuffed with nothing but vegetables like other places.   The prices are reasonable. Higher than what I pay at my corner spot but in a better location so I could reason why the price would be a hair higher.  The place is medium sized and clean.

While the rolls and the fish sauce tasted good they were greasy and without the romaine and herbs, ordinary.    The Mi Bo Kho arrived.. I was surprised to see about a half inch of oil on the top of the stew, I like some oil content but this was ridiculous! The stew tasted like it was made from a base and not from scratch.. had this weird fake beef taste. The meat was so fatty and not very well cooked. The meat was so stringy that it got caught between my teeth.   We finished sharing the dishes.. what a complete disappointment.. don't worry Da Vang, they have nothing on you!",

We come into the restaurant and it is actually a lot larger inside than it looks from the outside. Everybody inside was really nice and inviting. People who were coming in for lunch were greeted with recognition which was pretty nice knowing that people were coming back.  We started with egg roll appetizers and we have never had egg rolls with lettuce wraps. They were amazingly good! Our pho had came to our table and the smell was amazing. I ended up adding the jalepeno and the hotness of the broth had released the chili aroma and was just enough spice. The only complaint about the pho was how the chicken had tasted. The chicken had look and tasted like it came from a package. I'm not too sure why it had an odd taste but it did not set to well with me.  I would definitely come back to this location for some pho. Another reason I would come back is for the surrounding asian market.",

Anyways this place is pretty good. $10 for a bowl is much too expensive for me though. Lived in the bay area and the size here would be considered a medium for $7 at most.",

A nice portion of fresh basil, bean sprouts, jalapeno slices and a wedge of lime was served on the side so that I could add to my liking.  Excellent bowl of goodness!   The place was very clean and the staff could not have been more attentive or courteous.   I will be returning without a doubt.  The menu was huge for a restaurant of this type.  Well done!",

The server noticed I'd picked off the fat and tendon pieces and told me that the tendon was good for the joints- it's the main reason consumers of this style of soup order it.  I told her the main reason I picked them off is bec., visually, the pieces look like fat, and I don't like to chew or swallow pieces of fat.  I managed to salvage some of the tendon to take home.  I'm trying to acquire a taste for them...  LOVED the che bau mau (tri-color bean with coconut milk frozen dessert ($3).  It usually comes with green jelly strings, but I always ask to leave them out.    On my second visit, I took a friend with me and we shared a plate of spring rolls- 2 pieces of  fresh rolls containing pork and shrimp, vermicelli noodles, lettuce, and spring onions wrapped in rice wrapper and served with peanut sauce (I requested mine w/out shrimp).  Honestly, I've had better at other restaurants, including the one across from Un-Pho-Gettable, Com Tam.  This version contained more noodles than meat (Com Tam's version includes a crunchy aspect of pork rind stick!), but I did enjoy the peanut sauce.",

Tofu spring rolls and the accompanying peanut sauce is delicious. I can't specifically comment on any other dishes, but the family that I've brought here all love their dishes.

The portions are more than generous, my partner and I can usually share a bowl and still leave more than satisfied. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here. Both the beef and chicken based broths are flavourful, the cuts of meat are excellent. Neither of us have ever ended up with a fatty or chewy piece of meat, be it beef or chicken. Even my partner's 10 year old inhaled the Pho, and he's a picky little guy!   Try the Vietnamese version of diamond ice for dessert, if you like trying new things. Made with coconut milk instead of condensed milk, it's a refreshing way to cool off once the weather gets hot.   Whether you get Pho or one of the rice or vermicelli dishes, you'd be hard-pressed to find a dish that was really good. Add that to the super friendly and attentive staff, and you've got one very highly recommended Vietnamese restaurant!   The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the price. Bowls of Pho are $8-$9, which is a little high comparatively. If they could drop the price a couple bucks, they'd easily be a 5 star!",

He has already had it and he loves it and said that i absolutely needed to try it:)   We went and it was super packed! We went on a Sunday night. It was very lively.   We decided to get the veggie pho with tofo in it. We saw from the reviews that the portions are generous and we don't eat too much food at once, so we decided to split it.  and it was definitely more than enough! We also ordered the shrimp and pork spring rolls as an appetizer with that peanut sauce and omgoshhh that was sooo yummmyyyyyy. Never had that before and it was amazing! and also a side of white rice- which is always yummy in my book :)  I absolutely loved the pho! love how they fried the tofo, because im kinda iffy when it comes to tofu but this was really yummy. i didnt add to much sauce to it, just jalapeno for spice and i added the additional veggies.   for someone who has never had pho i really enjoyed this meal and i tend to crave it alot! i will definitely be coming back here!!! I also love the plaza/mall that they have! very nice :)",

    "text": "I moved to the Phoenix area a few months ago, from the Santa Cruz/South Bay area in CA, wherein I was spoiled with amazing pho houses all over the Bay Area.  This place is close to what I'm looking for in a great pho place; the pho itself should have a clear, flavorful broth sans MSG and excessive fat droplets on the top; noodles should be cooked, not overcooked, falling apart, or clumping; rare beef (tai) should be sliced thin and given abundantly, not overcooked (if served in the broth).  There are a variety of atmospheres, from cafeteria style to very cozy & relaxing... I like something in the middle with friendly, helpful staff sans excessive hovering. Here, the ambiance is a little off... more cafeteria style, especially with the double doors looking inward into the Asian shopping plaza.  Definitely very casual; the space is small and there were way too many people working.  I was greeting quickly... by three different people.  I asked the first server if they made the noodles fresh (rice noodles cook quick, so I pretty much expect this from a legit pho house) or if they pre-cooked and then put into the broth before serving (this causes the overcooked-ness & clumping); she wasn't sure so headed off to the kitchen to ask.  While she was gone, I was greeted by a 2nd server & let her know I was already being helped.  Later a 3rd server came by and took my order, I never got an answer about the noodles, so ordered the Pho Tai with fresh noodles and beef on the side, then she took off like a lightening bolt & didn't wait for my drink order.  It was served very quickly, so quickly that I was taken by surprise when they came bearing food :)  The broth and noodles looked perfect!  The broth was spot on!  I like the wider noodles (but this is more a Northern style pho & hard to find), but these were great, especially since they weren't overcooked.  The rare beef was sliced a bit too thick, but they gave a generous portion of 13 slices (extra is $3.50 for 10 slices). Since it's the broth that makes the pho; this place has definitely earned my repeated patronage... at least for when I'm in the mood for a very casual, cafeteria styled dining experience :)",

    "text": "Just finished eating at unPHOgettable--I LOVE this place (second time I've been there this week). I am new to pho--but from what I can tell, this place gets it right. The servers (because everyone seems to help here) are super sweet and attentive and the food comes out FAST and piping hot. The owner says they cook the broth for 26 hours (and you can tell by how flavorful it is), the noodles are never overcooked, and we always get white meat (which I appreciate).  And let's be honest--the name of this place is awesome haha.",

I ordered v4 item with egg noodles. It was awesome. The broth was so tasty that I could have gone for another round. A welcome place for vegetarian people.",

That's right, they told her she was NOT ALLOWED to get that dish, being told instead that she would like the number four. They strongly discouraged my fiancee from getting his first choice as well. I don't know about you, but I think we should be allowed to order what we want, not what the staff thinks we should want.",

    "text": "I wish I could give this place 6 stars.   We purchased the Groupon and went on the same night to unPhogettable.  By 6PM, this place was boomin.    We ordered the soft summer rolls (pork sausage), #8 (Pho with brisket and flank) and the #48 (steamed rice with seasoned grilled sliced beef).   The summer rolls were very good and came with a delish house sauce.  We hadn't received our dinners yet when a server came over and asked if we had the Groupon.  We said yes, and she explained that they couldn't accept it until the next day.  We hadn't read that on the deal, so I was a little frustrated (not mad, but just like, 'dangit!').  The owner stopped by and we talked to him for a few minutes.  We looked at our Groupon and saw that it DID say it couldn't be used until the next day.  So it was totally our over-sight.    He explained that a few tables had gotten mad and walked out, and they only did the Groupon to get new people to try their restaurant since June is the quietest month for most restaurants in the valley.  We told him that we didn't care about the Groupon, and were there for the food not the deal.  We decided we would just use the Groupon the next weekend.   Needless to say, he was very excited and grateful. I think we were more excited about our dinners though.    When our meals came out, he showed us the Vietnamese way to eat Pho and the rice and meat plate.  That was really cool.  It was obvious that he took great pride in his restaurant and food, and wanted to make sure everyone was happy.   I can't explain how amazing the food was. The #48 came with a broth on the side that you eat first to cleanse your palate.  I could have just eaten that as my meal and been totally satisfied.  The sauce on the beef was hard to explain.  It was slightly sweet, but had a lot of depth.  I was reluctant to share.   The Pho broth was fantastic.  After all of the noodles, meat and bean sprouts were gone, and we were both stuffed, I couldn't stop sipping the broth.  Seriously. It was so good, I didn't mind over-stuffing myself.   We said we would be back next weekend.  I don't think I can wait that long.",

The only complaint that i have is charging .50 cents per togo order which i really never heard off or experience before, it's the principle not the money. Prices are already high as is and the orders are kinda  skimmpy, i will probably  not go out of my way to dine at this restaurant.",

I have a favorite Vietnamese pho place that is Zagat rated back in Philadelphia and the pho at UnPhoGettable was very similar.  The noodles are perfect and the broth was delicious.  The meat was also very tender, melted in your mouth and had no fat. The soup came with basil, lime, sprouts, and jalapenos like usual, which were all very fresh.  The service was great also.  Always had a drink, food came out fast, and very friendly servers and owners.  Great place for pho lovers!  I will definitely be going back!",

    "text": "It was one of the most difficult decisions people come to every day. \"What should we eat Karlie  said\" Taco Bell? No, what about Filberto's, I shouted. That's when Karlie said \"lets go get Pho.\" I was silent in confusion. What's \"Pho\" (fuh). It sounded interesting! I was sold. The place is called \"UnPhogettable.\" I walked in, it's one of those places where you're not sure if you just sit down or if you wait for a hostess to escort you to your seat. With in 15 seconds a young lady walked up to us with a warm smile and said \"How are you doing today\" as she walked us to our table. She asked us if we would like to start out with any beverages. I liked how fast she moved. The facility was low lighting, the air was fresh, and they played calming music at just the right volume, so I could hear the waitress and my friends around me. After a couple minutes our waiter came up to us, he looked so excited! He was actually the owner of the restaurant.  The place was new and the menu had some crazy dishes. He gave us a little back ground of the food they served there and what exactly some of the dishes ingredients has in them. He explained everything very well. He just couldn't stop smiling, he was patient and answered all our questions with out sighing. When we all had some time to look over the menus I decided to order their \"number 9 Pho\", it comes with noodles, broth, and your choice of meat. The meat choices were chicken, steak, ham or pork. I chose the pork. On the side of the table there were the condiments. They had a sweet sauce that reminded me of a cross between a terryaki and eil sauce. They also had a more spicy red sauce. These were intended to be used with the Pho, it gives it a kick that your taste buds can't deny.  Before I knew it our waiter was already serving our table. What! Already! I have never had faster service before. It was an unexpected surprise. They set my bowl in front of me, my jaw dropped , the steam coming from my dish was hot and the aroma from the broth was indescribable. I was already wanting more! I started to unwrap my utensils from the neatly wrapped napkins. My serving of food was in a large bowl and it was filled to the top. This was well worth the money. My first bite was amazing. I decided to add some of their sweet teryiaky sauce. This was to good to be True. My food was hot, the meat was sliced into thin slices and was so tender, and the noodles were just right. Next thing I know they bring out a small plate with lime, bay leaves, and sprouts which are to be added to the pho dish. I thought to my self, \"This can't get any better\". I was wrong, it was phenomenal. After eating half my food I was full, but I couldn't stop eating it. It is almost an addiction. Through out our stay at \"Unphogetable\" our waiter constantly was stopping by our table to check on how things were going, they had great service all night. I was impressed at how fast we got our bill, we we're done. I left the restaurant full and happy. I would highly recommend this restaurant, it's the best decision you can make on a grumbling stomach.",
