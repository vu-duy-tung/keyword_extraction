    "text": "First off I will say the food that arrived was very good. I have eaten here countless times before with no issue whatsoever. In fact this was our go-to restaurant for burger night for a very long time. I really like this restaurant. The issue I had recently was not of food but the incredibly horrible service we had. Our waitress, I think her name was Deena, started off by forgetting to bring a cocktail over from the bar for me. No big deal really. The second strike was then when we were ready to order she asked immediately what appetizers can I start you off with. I didn't ask about any nor was I interested in any. She almost seemed disgusted that we didn't order any. I understand servers make more money in tips when the bill is more but don't be so pushy about trying to fluff up the bill with add-ons. This still wasn't a big deal but it was worth noting. Almost an hour after being seated the waitress came to the table with the side salads that usually come with the burger and she apologized that there was some error with the order and that the burgers would be out shortly. She apologized again and said she would take one of the meals off the bill and the manager or chef would be over in a moment. I asked for another drink and then she offered to take care of that also. Another server ended up bringing over my guests drink as our waitress had forgotten about that one also. The burgers finally arrived minus the mayo I had asked for the side of fries I ordered. After we were finished with the meal our waitress asked if we would like dessert. We were both full and didn't even finish our burgers. This was now a 2 hour dinner. We just wanted to leave. So we declined dessert and said we were full and just wanted the check. She insisted she bring us a dessert for the evenings problems. I asked for it in a to-go box, like I said we were both full. After about 10 minutes it arrived and then she finally brought the check. She stated she only charged me for the burgers and one drink each. I opened the bill and stared for a moment processing what she had just said and then asked \"so you just comped one drink?\" Her reply was she had also taken off the dessert. I couldn't believe she had the tenacity to even say that. I hadn't even asked for the dessert! At this point I was fairly pissed and also amazed of the things she had said earlier in the meal had just slipped her mind at this point. So I asked if that's all she planned on doing and her reply was I can talk to the manager for you. It wasn't like I was asking for something over and above what she had stated. But she made it out like I was the one being a pain in her ass. By that point I was furious and just wanted to leave, this is now almost 2 1/2 hrs after first arriving! I handed her my credit card and said do whatever you need to. She came back after some time and handed me back my credit card and said here you go we aren't charging you anything. Before I left I asked what was the problem with the order and why it was so late. She replied she did not know. The manager or the chef never came over at any time after the problem. They were definitely not too busy. In fact the chef had been socializing at the very next table to us with friends. If the manager had come over I'm sure I wouldn't be writing this. Have you ever heard of a problem bad enough to comp a meal or service where a manager does not come over to apologize or see what the problem was? Me neither. It will be a while before I come back and if I do I will stick with a different server.",

    "text": "As an avid fan of Fez, I had been looking forward to trying their sister restaurant Switch. Drink specials were good for the downtown scene, but unfortunately that is where the compliments end.  For a $10 sandwich (with small side salad) I expect fresh and high quality ingredients. Instead the sandwiches my husband and I got seemed barely above par of Subway. My sandwich was the Murano Chicken which described chicken and prosciutto. The \"chicken\" was a processed tasting lunch meat, not chicken breast. The aioli sauce was slathered on, almost as if to mask the rest of the sandwich, and the overly thick-cut under ripe tomato had to be picked off. The ciabatta bread also seemed fake and processed. Even the dressing on the Caesar side salad tasted weird...  I am truly disappointed to find Switch's food barely above what you would find at a fast food establishment for much cheaper.",

Per our email correspondence, the menu was correct, and the kitchen and wait staff needed to be re-trained.  My brother and I ended up visiting Switch around New Year's, and our meal cost was covered (as mentioned in the owner comment below).  I ordered the Dragon Pita again and it was delicious, so it seems the re-training was helpful.  My brother ordered some sort of BLT sandwich and really liked it as well.  I definitely appreciate a business that takes feedback (even on Yelp) as a learning/retraining opportunity, and one that will correct a bad experience, so I've upped my rating.",

    "text": "I'm continuing with my downtown streak of reviews... I finally made it to Switch!  This review is for my experience at lunchtime... and let me warn you, it gets busy during the weekday lunch hours, so go early or go late, but arrive at noon, and more than likely you will have to wait.  However, the community table is an option if you go solo or with a small group.  Another warning - the parking situation at noon - I think I lucked out and got the last spot in the lot; I happened to see a truck leaving when I came in, but there didn't seem to be any other open spots.  I noticed that Durant's next door offered 'humble valet parking' (interesting signage), but not sure if you are dining at Switch where you would park in this scenario.  I walked in through the back, and I liked the atmosphere and vibe immediately.  I was told there was a 20 minute wait for my party of 3, so I found myself a seat and did some work while I waited.  Pretty sure they have WiFi although I was using my Verizon card.  Great people watching was distracting me too; enough so that I missed when the rest of my party walked in!  Anyways, I caught up with them and enjoyed a great lunch...  Service was right on, and it was an overall delightful dining experience.  I had the 'Super Chop' salad - it had a little bit of everything in it (artichokes, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, corn, sunflower seeds, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach & field greens) - and I added turkey for a small extra charge... it was a huge serving and the perfect healthy lunch!  (Note to self and to anyone else that may be interested in adding protein to your salad in the future - go with something other than the turkey... I hate to sound picky, but it wasn't amazing).  Anyways, my two new friends (Kate and Angie) are regulars at Switch, so they ordered the hummus and lamb apps and shared - good idea!  I tried the hummus and it was tasty - I like how they served it with pita and sides of artichokes and peppers.  It was a tad different than the hummus at Fez, or at least that is what we all decided.  We were all very satisfied and too full for dessert... I guess I'll have to come back to try that another time.  Dessert and a bunch of other menu items that sounded good.  I also noticed that Switch serves breakfast all day on Saturday and Sundays, and does catering - good to know!",

The sangria was indeed special, and on special. We also got the hummus plate, which was really good, and I wish it came with more roasted red peppers, they were addicting! Yum.   A couple little weird things though, the host stand is at the back, or middle if you consider the patio, which I guess makes sense for them, but was kinda confusing for a first timer and there was nobody manning the stand there which didn't help. We also had a total of three servers, maybe we should consider that special treatment :)   But I'll be back, gotta try the brunch still!",

    "text": "UPDATE - The owner contacted me in regards to my review and has been pro-active in providing some better training for the wait staff. I haven't been back to verify any improvements but the fact that the owner is trying says a lot I think.   Original Review: The good....Food and Menu Options? YES! All the food we had was delicious and they had some nice choices. Good Prices? YES! Brunch was very good and the prices of carafes was really good.  The bad....Service? Meh... perhaps we just got the slow waitress. It seemed to take forever to get our food and drinks on Sunday morning. Then when we requested our checks it took her over 15 minutes (we almost just left) but we instead decided to stand by the register waiting to pay...then she shorted our friends change by $12 so lucky he counted it before we walked off. She was very apologetic about the delay but if the tip hadn't been included in our check (we had a large group) we probably wouldn't have left her one or at least not much of one.  With that being said, I will still try this place again even with our bad service experience and give it a chance to get more stars as it has the potential for at least a 4 star if not 5. So give it a try if you are in the area :)",

There were two large groups (10+) that were just getting settled in, but we were seated quickly. Our server was great, and I decided on the buffalo chicken sandwich with a side of fries and red sangria to drink. Btw, everything on their menu looks delicious, and everyone at the table had a hard time deciding. Anyways, my sandwich was bomb. The bread was delicious, the sauce had a great kick, and the chicken was plentiful. And the fries were as good as I remembered. The sangria was pretty average, but I ended up scoring a blueberry martini due to a mistake at another table which was very dangerous ;-)   It's a shame I don't live downtown or I'd probably frequent more oftne.",

    "text": "Stumbled upon Switch for lunch last week and what a pleasant stumble it was! The atmosphere felt reminiscent of FEZ also located in central Phoenix and also one of my fave dives. I asked someone and sure enough, it was. So I knew I was going to have a fantastic lunch.   The 3 of us arrived in the heat of lunch hour but were seated quickly....a mere 5 minutes. Our server arrived promptly and took our drink orders. The Sangria was calling my name but I decided to behave and order iced tea instead. Two of us ordered iced tea and my server was insightful enough to bring a carafe.  Cool points for this. I hate waiting for refills!   The problem with a menu in which everything sounds good, you can't decide on anything! And I couldn't decide! So with desperation in my eyes, I asked my server for a suggestion. He recommended the APRICOT BBQ CHICKEN SANDWICH w/ warm sliced chicken, shredded spinach, cilantro and red onion on warm ciabatta bread. OMG! This sandwich was so flippin' good! You know....it tasted like a bbq chicken pizza ....but as a sandwich. There! That's the best description. Biting in is wonderfully messy though...ask for extra napkins.   My colleagues ordered the CLASSIC HAMBURGER and the COUNTRY CLUB TURKEY PANINI. Both delicious. But my sandwich took home the prize by far!   Lunch hour ran like a well oiled machine. No super long waits for seating, service or food. Things you appreciate when short on time.

Both times the food, service and drink specials were great and my companion both times wants to duplicate the patio at her own house.  I don't remember all the appetizers we sampled on our first trip but for brunch we shared a quiche and a Gallete and both were really good and we were stuffed, the $3 carafe of Bloody Marys certainly did nothing to ruin our mood.",

First off the bread is great!  The sandwich is listed under \"Stacked Sandwiches\" rightfully titled.  The chicken is juicy and piled high. It also has prosciutto, garlic aoili and smoked gouda.  It is accompanied by a small ceasar salad that is very fresh and tasty.  It's rich enough for two meals so I save the other half for dinner.  I'd love to go back to this restaurant for dinner sometime or even a sit down lunch.  They have plenty to offer on their menu other than sandwiches.

I work on weekends but had one Sunday free, and since brunch is my favorite meal, I knew I had to try it somewhere in Phoenix.  Why this place wasn't absolutely slammed for 'weekend breakfast', as they call it, I have no idea.  $4 bloody mary and cape cod carafes, as well as screwdriver and mimosa carafes.  I also learned that my go-to drink (vodka cranberry) is also referred to as a Cape Cod.  Thanks, Switch!  Our server, Kai (taking liberties with the spelling) was the BEST.  He answered all of our questions capably and was really sweet.  The food came out swiftly and he checked on us just enough without hovering.    Okay, on to the food.  The bloodies were delicious, served with all the requisite greenery (lime, celery stalk, olive).  I love the idea of carafes.  I've spent up to $9 on worse bloodies in INDIVIDUAL glasses.    My boyfriend got the special for that weekend, which was a Maple Bacon Pecan Sticky Bun.  I had to capitalize it because OMG.  I took a bite and it was perfect.  Warm and bacony and mapley, and not too sweet.  He gobbled up every bite.  I ordered the fried bologna sandwich, sans tomato.  It comes on texas toast, with housemade aioli, mayo's fancy cousin.  It also came with a side of perfect potatoes.  I asked for them to be made without onions and they obliged, and they were delicious.  A good fried bologna is on the opposite end of the spectrum as the oscar meyer stuff.  And this was the best.  I ate up everything on my plate.    I can't wait to try out their regular menu.  If I didn't work every weekend I would be here as many weekends as possible.",

Gabriela always takes good care of us with a smile and good humor. The staff is helpful without the complaint and drama you sometimes find at restaurants when dining with a large group and splitting bills.  It has become a more frequent hang out for my friends and me.  When dining with a large group, it's sometimes difficult to agree on a place to eat.  We all agree on Switch.  Dollar mimosas, the recession plate, the large selection of gallettes, sandwiches, macaroni and cheese, martinis.....you name it.  All of these can be found here at a reasonable price.

It took her forever to figure out something she could actually eat. My friend is also one of the worst tippers of all time. I don't know how much she threw in for tip, but it better have been one hell of a good tip considering our server must have been driven mad because of her.   On to the food and drink. I LOVE that you can get $1 mimosas, cape cods, screwdrivers and bloody marys. Talk about gettin' trashed before noon. I could have stayed until 3pm when their $1 drink special ends. They don't skimp on the booze either. These drinks got me tipsy.  I had a hard time deciding what to order. Everything sounded so good. I decided on the egg stuffed crepes. The egg stuffed crepes had scrambled eggs, cheese, prosciutto and mushroom sauce. It also came with a side of potatoes. I very much recommend the egg stuffed crepes.   My husband ordered the breakfast gallette which is a puff pastry with eggs, sausage, cheeses, tomatoes and onions. After one bite this is another meal I would recommened.  I will definitley return to Switch for breakfast and would like to try out lunch and/or dinner.  I can only hope we didn't put out the server too much with the way my friend orders and tips. I think his name was Anthony and he was totally awesome and I hope we didn't put him out too much.",

    "text": "One of my new favorite finds!  I should have paid better attention to the reviews about going in from the entrance that faces Central Ave. though; that's actually the back door.  There's a parking lot off of Virginia Ave. that's much more convenient for the actual entrance.   All of the food we ordered was delicious.  Most of the dishes have a little twist on typically standard foods.  I had the chicken pot pie, and it's not a pie; it's the contents of a pot pie on a tasty fluffy pastry.  My boyfriend had the night's special, which was meatloaf with mashed sweet potatoes mixed with roasted red peppers.  The meatloaf had been grilled and was a mixture of beef and pork.  Our server was awesome and knew the ins and outs of the menu.  The decor screams hipster, but the general clientele does not.  Overall great experience and I'm looking forward to going back.",

The place has a very cool vibe to it and the wait staff is very nice...especially a tiny brunette...tip her well! I have had the Buffalo chicken sandwich which did not have too much sauce so it didn't take away from all the other ingredients. I also had the Cordon bleu pita that was amazing.  This is definitely a great place for lunch...especially because it's so close to where I work. I have not been for dinner but I expect the same great service.",

The service was spotty at best, the sangria completely mediocre, and the cheese panini tasty in that vague, reconstituted reheated-in-the-microwave way. The fact that we stood at the hostess station for many minutes, ignored, should have tipped me off at the get-go.  I will say, the place was packed... packed!... so perhaps I am in the minority. Switch gets raves from my friends, so perhaps I am the freak. That's OK. You guys can have my seat there, as obviously everyone loves it but me.",

We agreed that these were the best burgers in recent memory The special and the rest of the menu equally enticing but burgers won out. Tomorrow I intend to try the special when I take my associates back for dinner. The desserts are probably illegal in any nanny state. But this is Arizona so freedom to indulge is protected. Wife had bread pudding. I had the chocolate chip cookie dough. Warmed but not baked with just enough ice cream. Incredible! Come to think of it, I may skip the special and go directly to dessert.",

    "text": "Switch has some pricier menu items, but is pretty good happy hour/ brunch location.   Spacious patio in back, friendly servers, etc. .  Best things about this place: Froofroo drinks, Fruit, Fries, and Free Internet.      Froofroodrinks:  Refreshing and cheap.  The Sangria and mojito- vodka cocktail that I cant remember the name of right now, are great.  They are 1/2 price druring happy hour, which I believe is before 6:30 pm....then beer is half priced.   Brunch on weekends -- $1 cocktails.  nice.   Fruit:  Fresh fruit can be found in every section of the menu; sangria chicken sandwiches and salads (with grapes and feta) ... Berry Turkey Sandwiches..etc...  The drinks come with oranges and strawberries and grapes.  they should start infusing the fruit with liqour.  that would be even better.  Fries:  Switch has amazing fries.  Plump, seasoned and oven roasted potato wedges are a steal at 3 bucks.  They go great at the froofroo happy hour.  Free Internet: Also great for the froofroo drinks happy hour.  Sunday Brunch I recently went to the brunch with my manfriend, mostly for the amazing drink specials.   $1 screwdrivers, bloodymarys and mimosas, oh my.  It lasts till 3pm, which is also a huge plus.  The brunch menu isn't too exciting, and, likethe rest of the menu, pricier than it should be.  Also, the proatoes tasted like they had been cooked 3 days prior.    Overall, Switch is a great place to split food with someone and spend the rest on drinks.  Especially if it is 2:00 on a Sunday.",

For dinner, we had the absolute nicest server - I think he was the bartender.  He recommended a great wine and was just overly accommodating.    I've had a pannini, it was so-so.  However, the caesar salads are simple and fabulous.  Wedge fries are great too.  Hummus is good as well.  I've also tried the burgers, and they just didn't compete with the one's I've had at Fez.    The atmosphere is great.  I like the patio.  I don't know, there is just something about the food at Switch that just doesn't measure up to it's siblings.  I'd rather eat any day at Fez or Ticoz over Switch.    Oh, and the last time I was there (today for lunch) someone burned something in the kitchen and it stunk up the whole place.  It really solidified my thoughts ---  the reason this place doesn't get the accolades  I really want to give it is simply because of the boys in the kitchen.",

This was my first time here.  I have heard that they have amazing Happy Hour specials so I arrived early.  I didn't have a reservation, but the Hostess was nice to let us dine.  Tim, our waiter was outstanding!  Decor is really lovely but most importantly the food and drinks were really excellent!!  I had both the Blond (white wine) and Red (red wine) Switch Sangrias.   I like the Red over the Blond.  The alcohol kick of the red wine was stronger and fruitier.   I had the Crispy Iowa Pork sandwich.  The pork loin cutlet was fried in perfection.  You can taste the grain mustard in every bite.  Yum!   All sandwiches accompany with a Caesar salad.  For the price you can't beat the overall experience at this restaurant.",

The garlic hummus is a must and I will go as far and say it's the best restaurant hummus I have found in AZ. The hummus is nice and creamy with a double hint of gaaarlic . . .yum. Their brunch menu is perfect with quiches, omelettes, pancakes, and crepes. Don't forget the $1 mimosas on Sundays.   The ambiance is relaxing and fun. They have a cute outdoor patio and they have warmers during the winter months. The waiters and waitresses have always been helpful and friendly. I would recommend Switch anytime to anyone looking to eat at a fun place with good food.",

    "text": "So, hubby and I decided to make the most of our $5 coupon received @ the Yelp birthday party, and we hit up Switch a few nights ago.  I did the ordering, and I'd say I did a pretty great job:  We started with the jumbo shrimp cocktail(the cockatail sauce included shredded carrots and finely diced celery, so it tasted wonderful on its own, as well), which came with a small salad drizzled in some sort of citrus-y vinaigrette(couldn't stop eating it, myself :)  I ordered a Greek side salad for him(cucumber, tomato, and onion chunks covered in creamy minty yogurt and some of the richest feta I've ever had)...I ended up stealing most of it LOL...  for my meal, I ordered the Sangria salad: greens, grapes, green apples, and juicy strawberries with toasted almond slivers and that same creamy crumbled feta, all of which was marvelously paired with a sangria-based vinaigrette...  and I ordered the Blueberry Duck for him...not quite as much meat as I'd expected, but the blueberry-port reduction was TO DIE FOR, and mixed beautifully with the potato puree(tasted kind of like a light gravy)...the sauces made the already-tender meat almost melt in my mouth!  with my meal, I had the Vanilla-Peach Italian soda over vodka(the vanilla was far too strong, it tasted as if there was Tuaca in there, or some similar syrupy liqueur, but I quite enjoyed the whole peach in the bottom of the glass :)  on to dessert: he had the chocolate layer cake(very, very rich and decadent frosting), and I ordered the strawberry creme brulee--absolutely mouthwatering! the crust of the brulee was so smoky and sweet, and it paired perfectly with the light, fresh strawberries and the lighter-than-air creme...it was heavenly with a glass of the Juno chardonnay(wonderful honey undertones)  all in all, I'd definitely return to Switch...and this time I'd order the Blueberry Duck for MYSELF :)",

    "text": "BRUNCH AT SWITCH is where it's at!  Tried Switch on the recommendation of some friends and went there with a small group for Sunday brunch.  The place was busy, music was playing and people were bustling about everywhere as we walked in.  The atmosphere was very contemporary, but average dress was quite casual.  Even though we were a bit sandwiched at the back of the room next to several other groups in a make-shift arrangement of small tables, we got seated quickly and were rather comfortable.  The brunch menu had a good selection of items with popular names, but each one had Switch's own welcome twist.  Drink specials included mini-carafes (approximately 2 glasses each) of Mimosas, Cape Cods, Screwdrivers and Bloody Mary's for $4-$6 each and they all tasted very good, especially the Bloody Mary and the Mimosas.  My wife and I tried the Fruit Crepes and the house Chilaquiles, while the rest of the group indulged in the Huevos Rancheros, Breakfast Burritos and Breakfast Mac 'n Cheese.  Serving sizes were generous, but not too big.  Everyone enjoyed their dishes wholeheartedly and we all ate our plates clean.  I got a chance to try a couple of the items besides my own and I really liked the variety of textures and flavors they presented.  The only complaint we had was that some of the \"hot\" dishes arrived a bit on the cool side (though still warm in the center), likely from sitting as the staff waited to bring all the entrees out at once.  Our pleasant server always seemed to drop by just as we ran out of drinks and while there were a few times we had to wait to get something, it was obvious that the staff was very busy handling the rush of fellow brunch fans, so the small delays were completely understandable.  All in all, it was a pleasant experience and we are highly considering making this a monthly brunch stop just to \"Switch\" it up!  Recommended.",

According to her the restaurant named comes from the fact that they \"switch\" the menu every quarter to keep it fresh and to capitalize on using foods that are in season at that time.  The menu was very unique and had a lot of great options.  I went with the Herb Braised Pork sandwich on a pretzel bun, and my wife got the Dragon Pita.  We also shared the family-sized brussel sprouts.  It was all delicious!  The portion sizes were really good too; felt like you got your money's worth.

    "text": "The place was a little tricky to find; it's wedged right behind Durants and there didn't seem to be a turn-in off of central.  There is a shared parking lot for the restaurants, but it's pretty small and crowded.   The atmosphere was a bit weird. The restaurant is pretty small and gives off a feel like it should be found in a strip mall.  It just didn't feel classy or cool. We were also sat at the tiniest table ever!   We Started off the meal with two cocktails and an order of crab and lobster puffs. I had the Avion g5 and my husband had a Moscow mule; mine was very good,  his basically just tasted like ginger beer.  The appetizer was very tasty;  the pastries were very light and flaky,  and the sauce that accompanied them had a nice spice to it.  For dinner we each ordered a glass of malbec (yum) along with the clams and Verde valley pork. I gave our server the reign to pick my food (the clams) and I was very happy with the dish.  It's a good meal option for someone who doesn't want a huge meal,  but doesn't want to sacrifice flavor. My husband's pork dish was also extremely delicious.   Of course we had to pull the trifecta and go for dessert.  The creme brule was small but really tasty.    Overall we were very happy with the quality of food we received but weren't wowed with the atmosphere.",

Perfect for a date night or drinks with friends.   The food was amazing! We ordered onion rings as an appetizer and I quite think they are the best onion rigs I've had. Perfectly crunchy, tasty breading with nice tender, thick onion beneath. My friends ordered sandwiches and the pasta, which all looked amazing. I had the fried chicken with sweet potato mash and mushroom whatsitcalled. Absolutely delicious!  The highlight of our little girls' night was the drinks! The Jameson Apricot has my mouth watering even now. Perfectly balanced liquor and mixer.   I begged my husband to bring me back next month when we attend the symphony and I can't wait!",

We were served our wine in stemless glasses that is unacceptable for a wine bar.  All the menu items I had viewed on line such as crab lobster puffs were no longer on the menu.  I settled for the Thai tacos that contained enough sodium to float a boat.  My husband had the meatloaf sandwich which was just ok.  The best thing we had were the fries.  The interior is very nice but noisy. Needless to say we will not be back.",

They have a really cute patio out back for sitting outside when the weather's nice, which looked awesome!  I think they also have free wifi if I am correct.  I also enjoyed the couches in the front for waiting, but since I was waiting for my guest I did not utilize them.  The menu here is really solid.  Lots to choose from with a vast selection of items.  I went with a burger with Cesar salad, and my friend went with a salad of her own.  We both love eating here, so it was really tasty.  I didn't have anything to drink from the bar, but that was because I had other stuff to do, so I had to hold off on getting hammered.  I would recommend coming here for anyone, because the menu cannot be beat, and the food is delicious.",

The restaurant itself is cute and warm, but the food is medicore at its best.  I found the most flavorful thing I've eaten there is their hummus with warm, soft pita triangles. There was a lot more hummus than pita and note to self, it's an extra charge for more pita.  No biggie.  The onion rings were good also, when dipped in the sauce.  Entree's themselves were not that great.  I tried their Lobster & Seafood crepes and there was much more left to be desired. There was more \"seafood\" (tiny shrimp and fake crab) than there was lobster.  I would definitely not come back here again on my own free will, but would sacrifice it for my friends who adore the place.",

If you would like to take the kids, make sure its a lunch.  The night time atmosphere is clearly adult, with techno beats and barely lit ambiance.    For starters I like the Bruschetta Sextet to share. If we are in a small group we will get two and there is usually something for everyone's taste.  Salads are not your normal fare.  The Sangria is a nice summer  lunch with its field greens, grapes, strawberries, almonds, goat cheese and Sangria dressing.  The fresh Mozarella salad is also good, but I'm not a big fan of the honey vinaigrette.  The Super Chop Salad is huge and easily makes a meal and a half.    Burgers.  I am damn picky about my burgers.  The Switch Burger is a monster.  9 ounces of ground Angus beef could clog your arteries.  But the taste is so worth it.  I get mine without the Canadian bacon.  The goat cheese gives it a tangy twist.  The Classic Burger is not far off.  It too has 9 ounces, but you get to choose the normal toppings.  The one that gets high fives in our family is the Cowboy Burger.  Most of the time we go BBQ sauce free.  The bacon, cheddar and garlic aioli all create a taste that we come back for.    Sandwiches?  They have sandwiches.  The Cola braised BBQ Pork, the Mozzarella Caprese Ciabatta, and the Eastport Lobster Roll are all equally yummy.  Alright, the best dish and shining glory of this place is the Lobster and Crab Mac and Cheese.  It is sooooo good.  You know you shouldn't eat it.  Your doctor would probably say it will raise your cholesterol, but who the hell cares.  This is comfort food at its finest.    Dessert is also a trip down sugar coma row.  However, it too is worth it.  We love the Red Velvet Cake, the Creme Brulee, the Fairy Tale Brownie Sundae and, of course, the Bread Pudding.  Each is wonderful for its own reasons.  However, I lean towards the Bread Pudding and the Red Velvet Cake.    I highly recommend this restaurant.  The wait staff is always fun.  The chef knows his business.  And the food is always good.",

Several things made this lunch fantastic, in addition to the great friends and delicious food, two specific things earned Switch the extra star.  1) The Saturday brunch drink specials including the $3 carafes of typical brunch drinks (Cape Cod, Screwdrivers, Bloody Mary's, etc) and $6 pictures of Mimosas. 2) Our server, Shane.  Shane was hilarious, patient, friendly, and just one of the best servers our group has had in a long time!  Let me just say we are not known for leaving alcohol on the table, however today there came a point when we just had to walk away with almost a full carafe untouched.  (Could have been when we started knocking stuff off the walls and falling asleep at the table?)  With that being said (or typed) we still got more than our money's worth and a great time was had by all!!  Thanks again, Shane!!",

You will never have bad service. Chrissy is our personal favorite. She has been serving us for a good portion of the year and we absolutely love her. She is fast with bringing drinks recommending food options and creating drinks.  Now on to the food, WOW the chef is outstanding he creates magic out of burgers. My husband is obsessed with the  burgers. He loves the cowboy burger. Since he first tried their burgers he will not get anything else.  For anyone who doesnt like red meat he also tried the bean burger ( recommendation from Chrissy) and really enjoyed it.   I have Never had a horrible meal here and recommend it to every one I know.  I have gotten my mom hooked on their mac and cheese she goes once a month with her coworkers.   if you are close or far go try switch,( we live on I17 and Jomax and drive al the way down there at least once a week)  You wont be sorry!",

Our own little tapas bar.  1) Switch Lettuce Wraps: 4 mini lettuce cups with a combination of chicken, goats cheese, cashews, red onions, and an amazing fig balsamic dressing.  2) Crispy Rosotto Croquettes:  Panko crusted balls of sun-dried tomato & parmesan cheese risotto.   I've had nothing like these before.  YUM! 3) The Hummmus: This was a your typical hummus, however it was bountiful.  4) Bruschetta Sextet:  They looked good, but I didn't end up trying these.  I've had them in the past and it's a wonderful   Overall we had a great meal and good time.  Our service was very good and as always the food was excellent!

I ordered it with crab the first time and had it plain the second time. You can add lobster, crab, chicken, but plain is how i liked it best. We ordered the shrimp app. It was delicious. The shrimp was done in a citrus marinade and served with a small salad and topped with avocado. Now to the reason I'm writing this review, the Chicken Pot Pie. Oh yeah, this version of pot pie had me worried cause its served open face and that's a problem cause I love the crust on top and was worried I would not like it. But with a little help for the server I went for it. I posted a pic. It was so good and I would not want it any other way now. It just works for me. This was the last thing I was going to order and now I know I'm going to have a hard time ordering next time cause I know how good this dish is. I really like this place, from the service to the decor and especially the menu. I cant wait to go back!!!",

This is one of my favorite places to go because the hours work for my schedule and the food and service is usually impeccable. But last night wasn't a great experience for me. Our server, Timothy, was a little snappy and just seemed like he had a chip on his shoulder. He didn't smile and barely checked on us. I'm not a hard person to please and I would completely understand if the place was insanely busy, which happens, but there were only a few other tables in the restaurant. Aside from our poor service I watched as a few other employees were passing around a cell phone and chasing each other throughout the restaurant. There is a fine line between a laid back atmosphere and complete laziness...I wasn't impressed. I just hope the management is able to run a tighter ship. Behavior like that will kill a business and there are plenty of other places in the valley I would rather spend my money if it continues. All it takes is a smile and a warm demeanor and if I feel like I'm an inconvenience to a server...I will gladly go elsewhere...",

It wasn't busy when we got there, but a few more tables filled up as the night went on. I had the apple bellini to drink and it was delicious and so cute with an apple slice right in it. Started off with the beef tacos and were blown away. It was the perfect mix of sweet, spicy, creamy, and crunchy! I literally could have eaten a platter of them. For my entree I chose the Apricot BBQ Chicken sandwich and it was sooo good! I definitely recommend this place to anyone in the downtown Phoenix area and I plan on going back very soon!

I was a bit apprehensive the day we went because of the other reviews I had read that morning, but nothing went wrong. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful and the food was delicious.  We had to start, the garlic and lemon hummus and the baked lobster and crab puffs. The hummus was good but the lobster and crab puffs were phenomenal. For the main course I had the seafood and lobster crepes, with lots of lobster and light and fluffy crepes. Definitely recommended. I only had one complaint: when we arrived and parked in the lot behind the restaurant, we saw the patio and to the right of that was a sign on the wall. The sign pointed to the left and said Patio and then pointed to the right and said Main Entrance. So we went to the right and around the building to the front and entered only to be told that the main entrance was actually through the patio. That was definitely confusing and maybe something they should correct.",

The drinks were ok, quality of liquor used was lower end.  Our entrees which were both cold sandwiches and seemed to take quite a while, which seemed odd.  We then passed on dessert.  This is where it went south.  We paid our bill and as my friend and I walked to my car, our waiter Scott accosted us asking if there was a problem with the service.  Keep in mind we left a 15% tip.  I'm not sure what his problem was, but we were in shock. We told him that we left his tip on the table and he walked away without an apology.  How unprofessional--either possibility if he thought we didn't leave enough, then he had a major attitude problem.  If he thought we didn't leave anything, then he was a total wad and physically blind.  Unprofessional service and mediocre food means no repeat visits.  I'm really surprised at the service received at some restaurants during this recession.  I've not received any replies to my reporting of the incident to Switch management via email on their website.",

    "text": "So I did a google search for 'gourmet Mac n cheese' in Phoenix and this place popped up since they have 'The Mac N Cheese Plate'. I was really excited to try it since the description sounded great with 3 cheeses and bread crumb topping. I started with a drink called Ting Tang Tini and it wasn't too bad. The service wasn't awesome as our server wasn't the most attentive and she was kind of short with us while we were placing our order (and the restaurant wasn't THAT busy). So I got my Mac N Cheese plate and it looked okay, but nothing fancy and It was hot as lava and stayed hot for at least fifteen minutes, which I found odd because REAL cheese usually cools off faster than that. When it cooled down enough to taste it, I quickly realized that the '3 cheese blend' was really just some sort of plastic-like fake cheese such as Velveeta. There were hardly any breadcrumbs on the top, which was also a disappointment. I don't have a huge problem with Velveeta cheese, but if I am paying $11 for Mac N Cheese, I definitely expect it to be real cheese and somewhat a bit more Gourmet. Other than the disappointing pasta, Everything else was alright-nothing to write home about and I don't see myself going back there any time soon.",

    "text": "We finally made it down here after hearing good things from the locals. We only stayed about an hour but I would defiitely love to go back. My friend and I had the $2 margarita special on Fridays and when the server brought it out, I was like, maybe we didn't get the special (since the glass was so tall). But to my surprise, it was the special! A girl can get into alot of trouble with those yummy tall glasses of $2 goodness. Since we were headed to a reverse happy hour, we split their $10 bruschetta plate. Note, my husband orders it correctly to sound like: \"Brusketta\" and the server corrects him, \"Oh, the brushetta\"? Funny but annoying, too. The bruschetta was extremely good with three pieces each of two kinds. When I go back, I am dying to try their white cheddar grits. Their menu looked pretty good and we loved the decor. There was lots of different types of seating and the patio looked super cute. I can't wait to go back and get tanked on $2 margaritas...classy, I know.",

    "text": "I went here with a group of friends to celebrate a friend's birthday.  We brought a cake in with us as we do that for each other's birthdays.  When we first walked in, the first thing we get from the host is that they do not allow outside foods.  We then have to walk all the way back to our car to put the cake away in the AZ heat.  That put a sour taste in my mouth before I even looked inside the restaurant or sat down.  From a far, this restaurant has a nice patio entrance/area perfect for a warm night (if no one ruins it by smoking there).  They do not have a lit up sign of their restaurant that can be easily seen.  However, food is actually really good here.  I had the braised BBQ pork on talera bread and loved it.  It comes with a side of ceasar salad with options to upgrade to fries or sweet potato fries and other sides.  You can expect a tasty variety of sandwiches, burgers and other full meals from this place.  Our waiter was courteous and on top of things too.  Be aware of the 20% gratuity for 6 or more people.  Really?  This is a nice casual place, not a fancy black tie restaurant.  At the end of our meal the birthday person didn't even get a free dessert.  I would normally give this kind of restaurant at least 4 stars...but not tonight.",

We tried the vodka tea which was yummy, but truly wanted the sangria and Bloody Mary too! We shared the Thai tacos OMG! Delish. And then the house salad. Everything was fresh and flavorful. The people sitting next to us had wonderful looking Waffles and crepes, and they kept eyeballing our dishes. My only downside comment is that it is a bit pricey (12.95 for salad and 12.95 for the street tacos) but the drink carafe (2.5 glasses) was only $6.00. I will still show up again when I'm back in town. The staff and taste has made me SWITCH for sure.",

    "text": "It's been awhile since I Switched it up a little (okay, I promise that's the last bad joke on this review).  I've been here at least half a dozen times and the food has always been good (at times great).  The menu has been tinkered with a little bit from time to time, but most of the big favorites are still front and center.  My parents adore this place so when they said they wanted to grab dinner somewhere near Downtown on Friday night, I threw Switch out there as an option.  Unsurprisingly, they leaped at the opportunity.  Switch is actually one of a number of restaurants owned and operated by MTM Concepts.  You may know them for some of their other popular Downtown area restaurants including FEZ, Bliss ReBar, Cordoroy, and Pizza People Pub.  Each of MTM's restaurants has a different influence.  Switch's veers toward contemporary American and European influences.  The restaurant occupies a sizable footprint on the northeast corner of Central & Virginia alongside Cordoroy and other popular neighborhood staples Durant's and Wild Thaiger.  Enter through the back parking lot where you'll find abundant patio seating outside and room for probably upwards of 100 inside.  I've never seen it completely full here so getting a seat has never been a problem.  The problem lies in choosing from their pretty extensive menu choices.  Shockingly of all the times I've been here, I've neglected one of their most popular appetizers.  The Lobster & Shrimp puffs.  4 flaky almost strudel-like creations filled with a lobster & shrimp seafood mix, topped with chipotle aioli.  Yup, that's the ticket.  Perfect app for sharing (or using as an entree for yourself, which I likely would've done if I weren't here with my parents).  For the entree this go around, it was another item I'd (up till now) neglected to try despite it being right up my alley.  Mac & Cheese anyone?  And while we're at it, can we add in more lobster and shrimp?  Thank you that will do very nicely.  In fairness I blanked on the fact that MTM owns both Switch and Pizza People Pub.  Because I'm pretty sure I've had this exact mac & cheese dish at Pizza People Pub before.  Dock a point for lack of originality if you must, but I was happy.  SUPER rich and creamy just as you'd expect.  In fact so rich I only could get through half of it before I had to get a to go box for the rest.  Why?  Because I was saving room for the big finish.  I had my eye on the Lemon Chiffon Cake from the moment this dessert menu item crossed my field of vision.  The description reads like poetry to me.  Layered lemon cake with chiffon cream, strawberries, blackberries, and a berry gastrique.  Gimme gimme gimme.  Admittedly the tartness can be almost overpowering in spots, but a delicious dessert nonetheless.  Total cost the app, entree, dessert, tax and tip (minus the $5 Yelp check in discount which they do honor) came to about $70.  Yeah, that's kind of the downer here.  The prices (particularly for the sandwiches and popular main entrees) aren't cheap.  To be fair I did order two lobster themed dishes so obviously that's going to cost a little more.  But even the sandwiches and burgers here are around $15-$20.  Having dined at all of MTM's establishments, this is a pretty common theme at each one.  The food is quite good, but the prices will spook some.  For my parents, they were happy campers and didn't mind their bill as they were going to town on their dishes.  For maximum value at Switch, I recommend happy hour and even their weekend brunch specials are a pretty good value.  As for me, I was plenty satisfied with my dishes on the night, just as I have each of my prior visits to Switch.  And (bonus!) I get to eat leftover lobster & shrimp mac & cheese for lunch tomorrow.",

Beer was limited and we wish there were more locals and drafts to go with the great food. Now I am a huge onion fan, but the reason I gave this a 4 was that the flavor of my crazy fried chicken sandwich (can't recall the name) was just not fab. The onion jam plus fried crispy onions was too much. Then the breading just wasn't my favorite on the chicken. But seriously everything else was amazing including the fries!",

For appetizers we had the pretzel & cheese presentation as well as the bruschetta. All of it was extremely tasty. The pretzels were especially soft. In all honesty, I was full by the time that my entree came. I ordered the Spicy Adobo pasta w/ Chicken. This dish was not overly spicy and included mushrooms & asparagus. The dish was nicely done. The staff was very friendly and easy to communicate with. Overall a good experience.",

Perhaps due to the overall paint color and decor which is a little drab even for Phoenix standards.   Server was super nice and very attentive, manager even came by to say hi. Menu choices were just ok, standard faire I guess. Brunch menu looked better than actual lunch menu which is why I leaned towards brunch.   Sadly the menu item I desperately wanted was out. Apparently one must stop in before 12:30 to get the dish. Hmmm...if it's that popular, why are there not more of it made?   As a runner up dish I had the Huevos Rancheros and I was pleasantly surprised! I'd have to say it may have been the best HR I've ever had - seriously! Very fresh ingredients and seasoned to perfection, the amount of heat was spot on! I'm particular about my tortillas and it was also a winner! Mind you it was a single tortilla.   My friend seemed to enjoy his BLT, his macaroni n cheese was pretty good. It wasn't an included side dish but the server had no issue with \"upselling\" it along with avocado for his sandwich. She made the attempt with me but I caught on real quick. He also had a \"Lemonade\" but it was no more than a crystal light in a glass - False advertising! :(  We went in for a light lunch and walked out wallet poor. The lunch bill came to $40 NOT including tip! 2 lunches 2 non-alcoholic drinks and $40...in the end it really must have been the upselling that gouged the pocketbook.   The likelihood of returning is pretty much not in the cards.  Considering the amount of restaurants in the valley, skies the limit so why return to something that was almost overall underwhelming.",

Food is alway fresh, original, served with thoughtfulness and has a slice of personality and imagination I expect from a quality food service establishment.  Service has been routinely efficient.  I like to get take out on occasion as my work hours are varied and often end up having late dinners.  They are packed with care, don't forget items and consider not mixing protein with salads until I can get home (Separate containers).  This is great as it keeps the greens fresh and allows you to reheat protein if needed before adding to the salad.  Well done!  Keep it up.",

Oh  Emm  Geee  We have eaten here on the patio no less than 20 times since the last time I reviewed this place.  The carafes on weekends are chock full of booze and reasonably priced.  The salad is AMAZING and whatever my ex-DH ordered he loved too.  They have an amazing waitress that we got EVERY time afterward and she is a doll.  Oh, I'm sorry Switch.  If it helps any... I was sitting next to a couple on an airplane and they said, \"Have you ever tried Switch?  It's amazing!\"  Even 30,000 feet above ground people are talking about you.  For the record, I agreed - your food, your booze, and your waitress are amazing.",

    "text": "Tried this place for lunch based off a recommendation since it's close to my office. It's a cute little restaurant that I was happy to walk into, but I came in right around noon and we didn't get out of there for a solid hour and a half  even though we ordered right away. The food took FOREVER and the waiter although very nice and so good with the drink refills, hardly came by after our food was delivered so took an extra 20 minutes longer to get our check than it should have. I think for lunch places, especially downtown where people are clearly working and just on a break, should be more mindful of people's time.  I had the switch house salad which was decent but wouldn't order again. The switch house burgers were a popular item for tables around us and looked really good so will probably try that if I go again. My friend ordered the Fish and Chips which I think was the special of the day. The fries/potatoes were really good. I tried a fish stick and it seemed like good fresh fish, just way too fried and greasy for me but I guess people expect so she seemed to be happy with it. Oh, and at the risk of sounding super cheap - I got charged an extra amount for the extra side of dressing which I always find irritating especially when they don't tell you. I wouldn't have ordered it had I known and it was a waste because by the time I got it I didn't use any of it.",

There's a nice little outdoor patio area where I would have sat down, if it wasn't super hot that night. The waiters & hostesses were quick to sit me down and take my order and overall was a pleasant experience. The summer salad that I had was pretty amazing too. Added some chicken to that and *boom* a great salad.   The only thing that was odd was the ambiance of the restaurant. The walls are painted black and they tried to go for a \"loungy\" look even though it's not *really* a lounge. I kinda wish it was more bright in the seating area...",

It is cooked perfectly. The chicken is tender, cooked well, without being rubbery or flavorless. The salads are wonderful. The starters are wonderful. And the iced tea doesn't taste like dishwater, which, in Phoenix, is always a great big plus!!  I can't say enough about the food because, well...it tastes like the owner truly cares about quality ingredients, decent size portions, keeping the cost to the customers low considering what you get, and well...just making everything taste truly special.  Inside it is busy for lunch and you might wait 5-10 minutes. It is nice inside, with leather couches to sit in while you wait. It is LGBT friendly, and has a sophisticated vibe. Restaurant and bathrooms are spotlessly clean.",

We ordered lamb lettuce wraps, lobster puffs, pork verde, Amsterdam pasta, mac n cheese with lobster, and a special seafood bake. Every single thing was perfection. Melt in your mouth perfection.

Two of our party received their food in relatively short order. My plate didn't show up until over 30 minutes later, at which point the rest of the table was finished eating and needed to leave. That situation wouldn't have happened if our waiter had been checking on us periodically, or even been visible so I could have stopped him to have him check. (Having had to leave the table prior to ordering just to locate him and put in our order should have been my clue that this was off to a bad start.)  I am very accommodating and understand when a restaurant is busy that this can happen, but I felt there was no excuse for the delay.   I was very disappointed and have better places to spend my money and time. I'd recommend looking elsewhere.",

The chilaquiles in particular used the blandest red chile sauce that tasted like it came from a can at the local supermarket.  Especially considering the price, these dishes earn a big thumbs down from me.  Also, the brunch options skew heavily towards meat and potatoes and carbs, if you are dining with vegetarians/ vegans or even simply the health conscious they will have very limited options.  It's $5 for a side of fruit.  My chilaquiles had tiny pieces of chicken mixed in with few limp peppers and onions and tons of tortilla strips that reminded me of soggy Fritos, all coated in a miserably bland red chile sauce with no discernible heat at all, with poaches eggs, crema, and a little feta on top.  I ate the eggs and picked out the chicken, but I hated the sauce so much that I couldn't eat the chips.  I should have known better than to order Mexican food from this place.  I won't return.  If you're going to put Mexican food on your menu in the Southwest, do it right.",

I recently stopped in for lunch, after a 6-month hiatus, to find that two of my favorite sandwiches have changed.  Both the BBQ Apricot Chicken Feta Sandwich and the Spartan Pita both use to be served with shaved Chicken Breast.   Now they are served as a whole chicken fillet.  Couple of things about this new presentation.  First, it's very difficult to eat a pita with chicken that isn't chopped or sliced.   Second, the chicken looked slimmy - like it had been reheated.   When I asked the waiter why the switch (ha ha) from shaved chicken breast to a whole chicken breast, he said the chef said that the meat was now a higher quality and can't be shaved.  Weird answer on many fronts. I mean, really, why would you even admit you weren't always serving quality food?    All I can say is that the chicken looked like it was frozen, spiced, and heated in the microwave.  This coupled with the fact that a pita is very difficult to eat when the chicken is served a la \"Burger King\" patty versus shaved (or at least chopped).  I use to love Switch for its unique combo of flavors - but in particular for these two sandwich standouts.   Now, I can't bare to ever go back.",

    "text": "This restaurant has a hip and modern vibe, reminds me of the W hotel or aLoft hotel. I like how there are sofas that invite you to sit and chat, and how they transformed the space between Switch and Schlotzsky's into a little outdoor area.  Why you should eat at Switch: -Unique options (everything on the menu looks good - there are so many different kinds of sandwiches!) -Great flavor. I got the Dragon Pita and it was really delicious. On the downside, I had to eat it with a fork and a knife because the sauce was dripping all over the place and they didn't give us any paper napkins. -Freshness. Although $10 seems a bit much for a sandwich or burger, it was justified when our food came. All the ingredients are fresh and high quality, and the portions are appropriate. Even the water tasted really good!  Why I don't give Switch 5 stars: -Slow service. We were sitting for about 8 minutes before the server came to ask what we wanted to drink. The wait for our food seemed like forever (c'mon, how long does it take to make a sandwich?). Or maybe I'm just used to Subway. Strangely though, our server was amazingly quick to take away our plates and bring the bill. hmm. -The lighting. It was way too dark, it was actually darker inside than outside. This may be personal preference, and of course it is a bar, but next time I'm going here during the daytime for lunch, and not dinner. -Consistency. Whereas the Dragon Pita was delicious, the Lobster Roll was pretty ordinary. If you don't know what will turn out good, I'd advise choosing something with a variety of eclectic ingredients.  Finally, this restaurant seems to be targeted more towards the 20-35 year old age group. I wouldn't advise coming here with children or your parents... unless you order take-out.",

I am very pleased to see this type of establishment be part of the growing downtown/revitalization trend that is underway in Phoenix, Arizona.   When I got there they had just opened their doors for that days business  so I cannot say that getting a parking place was difficult. I could see it being difficult  during peak hours though because they do share parking lots with another popular Phoenix restauraunt .  In fact, within the first 30 minutes of our being seated the place started getting a good crowd for brunch. We were greeted, seated and waited on by the same person. (which I  prefer) There is nothing more distracting than having a greeter, a seater, a waiter a water boy and server just to serve you simple fare.   Our server, Jen, is an absolute gem! From start to finish she was attentive, friendly extremely personable and has one of those million dollar smiles to go with it all. If you can get one of her tables, by all means do! Jen is also employed by Switch's sister restaurant Ticoz.  Another review for another time.   My friend and I shared an appetizer of hummus that was garnished with roasted red peppers and sliced artichoke heart. It was excellent. In fact, if you are not one to have ever had hummus, I suggest you try theirs. You will be a hummus eater from there on out. We each ordered sandwiches that were served with a delicious side Ceasar salad sans croutons and with a very rich, creamy garlicky Ceasar dressing. Yum! The sandwich I had was the Jalisco Chipotle Chicken sandwich and my friend had the Big BLT. That sandwich is appropriately named. It has 10 slices of bacon on it! Both sandwiches were delicious and through the whole meal I kept wondering why I never made it out to this place. Originally I saw some not so nice comments regarding the ambience and the food as well as some of the drink prices. However, I've come to the conclusion that some of the previous negatives from other reviewers are just from \"uppity uptight no good bogus old queens\" who have nothing better to do than gripe. This place is excellent, as is the food. Prices are reasonable and I would gladly pay the same price for half the food.  The ambiance is trendy but not pretentious or overdone. It would fit well into the likes of many of the east coast places I've been to. So if you are in a rut as to what to try for your next meal out I would definitely make the \"Switch\" and come here.",

I throughly suggest NOT ordering the hamburger simply because it they cannot cook it to order and it tastes like freezer burn. The buffalo sandwich continues to be a staple.

While this place came hihgly recommend by friends and the magazine, I thought it was average at best.  Tried the sandwich in the article, the Murano.  Tasty but nothing extraordinary.  Certainly not  on of the 21 best in the Valley.  The side of mac-n-cheese was also average.  Friends had the turkey galette and the lobster mac.  Both enjoyed them; maybe more than I enjoyed mine.  You need to be comfortable eating with strangers at this place as the tables are way too close to one another.  For those who like Swicth, if you look up their web site on your mobile device, there is a coupon for free hummus.  Won't go back and suggest to Phoenix Magazine readers to replace the Murano with the Frency at the Vig and 40th and Camelback - a MUCH better sandwich.",

I had the Ibiza Sangria Chicken Sandwich.  As soon as it arrived I knew I was in for a let down.  The menu states \"roasted chicken\".  What I got was clumps of soggy compressed deli chicken.  The bread was described as a \"large rustic artisan roll\".  It was not large...nor was it fresh.  Artisan to me does not mean stale and tough.  But the biggest issue was with what is described on the menu as a \"Caesar salad\".  There are variations on this dish available for the chef to draw from, however chopped iceberg lettuce with a few bits of romaine thrown in changes the dish into a mixed green salad, not a Caesar.  Also there was no cheese, no croutons, no hint of anchovy, just the mixed lettuces with a Caesar-style dressing glopped on top.  Sloppy, tasteless presentation of the food along with confused descriptions on the menu makes me not want to go back.  Save some money, you can get something similar at Arby's for half the price.",

I really don't want to spend too much time reviewing food that's better executed at Jack in the Box so let me just tell you it was pretty bad. Some hot dishes came out cold and cold dishes came out luke warm WTF. The drinks were over priced and the place was cheaply put together and I mean in a failed attempt to lure people in with a $100 design budget, Target furniture and terrible design taste kind of way. I love to eat and I wouldn't have minded if my server/manager wasn't so rude and arrogant or the food was way better. It's probably a former deli turned restaurant that someone thought \"Hey let's put blue light bulbs in, play techno, serve martini's and all the gay men in town will love it.(insulting)\"???? My brother (which is gay) was with me that day he lives part time in San Fran and that was his feed back on this, which my girlfriend shared the same opinion on this since we have many friends in the gay community. I think I have said enough or maybe to much but I know that I don't want to say any more...",

Switch turned out to be excellent. It is comfortable, chic, and the people that work there are so nice. I was expecting a snooty atmosphere, but not at all what I got. I asked for tequila straight in a glass with nothing else, and the waiter brought me a full to the rim rocks glass of tequila. You can't beat that! The food was great too. I had the Amsterdam chicken pasta. Wow, yummy. I am definitely going to be a repeat customer. They had some great sandwiches on the menu that I can't wait to try. I live about 30 minutes away, and I will do the drive to eat there again.",

My server could not even get a basic order right, and there was hair in my food of which the server asked if I would place it on the plate maybe he wanted to analyze it in the kitchen. When my food was brought back a second time it was still not what I requested by now my party was done with there food and I have not yet eaten. The server never apologized a manager came over and with a smile said that he would comp everything ( thanks but I have not yet eaten!!!!) comping the meal was the least you could have done to fix the situation. We will never go back they just seem like they don't give a crap like it's all a joke. Not a customer centric restaurant. They think they are hip and cool here and they look like a bunch of Dutch boys with the caps that they wear. Guys lose the caps your selling newspapers. I went straight to McDonald's placed in order they got it right delivered it hair free and then I paid them. It should always be that easy.....in any case I will take inspiration from their name and \"switch\" to another place to eat. Do yourself a favor pass on this place and go somewhere else your friends and family will thank you for it. This place should switch from customer no service to customer service if they want to be around in six months. People vote with your feet and when you see this place keep walking.",

Although it overlooks a parking lot, the cushy blue furniture still makes the atmosphere appealing.    Start with the onion rings - they're crisp, crunchy, thick, and delicious.  Sandwiches There's a wide variety of sandwiches, many of which are quite good and feature ingredients like soft pretzel buns, housemade pickles, and grilled ciabatta.  Skip the lobster roll and go for one of the pitas or, if you're in the mood for something hearty and a little sweet, try the Southern Dump Truck.  Although the chicken batter won't be as crispy as you might like and will slide off of the thigh meat, the meat itself will be moist and flavorful.  Maple tabasco mayo and vidalia onion jam give it a real touch of sweetness to balance it against the tartness of housemade pickles, all sandwiched inside a pretzel bun with bacon and fried onion strings.  I wouldn't recommend it for a weekday lunch unless your job is compatible with post-lunch food comas!",

Besides brunch I would state (as a foodie) that they have the best food for the price in Phoenix ($12-17 for most entrees). Their specials in particular are always interesting, delicious and affordable. I would also recommend their 'DUMP TRUCK 2.0' sandwich.  Great choice for parties of 2 to 6 people. Their outdoor seating is very modern and great in good weather (no misters, only fans).",

    "text": "What better way to spend the first 118 degree day of 2016 than with....carafes of bloody marys and sangria at Switch? My critic in crime, \"Fork\", and I were visiting downtown to attend a local art show. Afterwards, we headed to Switch for lunch. Conveniently located on Central right next to well-known, Durants, Switch is a new, hip take on dining. Fork and I both agreed that the restaurant decor was modern and trendy.  Fork commented that she thought it was a bit noisy on this Saturday afternoon.  The pressed tin ceiling may not help with the noise. For my part, I didn't find the noise as any impediment to across the table conversation. Back to the carafes... Fork had a carafe of sangria ($6) and I had the bloody marys ($4).  Both great deals as you easily get 2 plus drinks from each carafe. For apps, Fork and I split the Brie Wedge and got an order of hummus.  The Brie Wedge was very nice. Baked and coated with panko it is served with toasted bread, berries and green apple and a drizzle of honey.  Very nice.  In my opinion, the hummus was just average. Paled, really, in comparison to the wedge.  The serving of hummus was also quite small whereas the wedge seemed more plentiful.  For our entree, Fork ordered their Sangria salad and added salmon.  She said the salad was quite good.  Nice greens, grapes, strawberries, goat cheese, almonds and apple. Fork also appreciated the fact that the dressing was served on the side. Fork liked the option of \"dunking\" rather than \"drowning\" her salad.  The salmon, Fork said, was prepared perfectly. I had the Cowboy Burger which was quite good. The burger was cooked just right and the ground beef was ground to just the right consistency.  The burger comes with barbecue sauce, bacon, cheddar, aioli, onion on a brioche bun. I had the Cesar salad as the side which was a very good choice. Nice dressing a big shavings of cheese. Our server, Drew, was very attentive, but did not hover. We did have one little mix up in that I was given the wrong bill when I went to pay. However after bringing it to Drew's attention, he was quick to correct the mix up. I believe both Fork and I enjoyed Switch and we think you will too. Be sure to check out those carafe options; you won't be sorry!  - Knife  (Written by Knife of Knife N Fork. Be sure to check out the reviews written by my critic in crime (and art show buddy), \"Fork\", of Fork N Knife.)",

The red sangria was also amazing. Would love to come back during happy hour, hang out, relax and try a new food item!",

First, the cocktails:  new takes on old favorites were fun and delightful.  The food:  inventive, but not kooky; delicious, generous portions, fresh ingredients, served hot as intended.  The service:  our waiter was Sheree(sp?) and she was attentive, helpful, professional, friendly attitude, and a terrific asset to this restaurant.  We don't live in Arizona, but will go back soon to eat at this restaurant and see the next great exhibit at the beautiful Heard Museum.",

My husband got the chicken fingers app as his entree and they were delicious and homemade and crispy and different than anything we've had before! My brother got one of the chicken sandwiches and it was so tender and had the best mix of flavors - he said it was the best. I got the lamb meatballs special with cheesy grits omg mouth watering. The list goes on! Their menu is to die for, and their drinks menu was awesome too. You will want to order everything. The atmosphere was great and our waiter was awesome! Definitely put up with our loud table very well haha. We had a blast and will definitely return ASAP.",

I suggest trying the Fried Chicken Bites appetizer. The chicken was perfectly crispy and had a great flavor. We ordered the Nashville Hot version of the app. It wasn't as spicy as I would have liked but it was still delicious. I also got to try the Super Chop salad! I love that they add white beans and sun dried tomatoes! It added great texture to the salad. I'll definitely be back for reverse happy hour soon! They also have wine deals on Monday! App and a bottle for only 20 bucks! I'm in!",

That was a sign of things to come. Our server was attentive but not overbearing (that would have been difficult). Our refills flowed well. So the service, outside of a misplaced soda on one of 14 individual checks, was impeccable.  The food was good. I had the Caesar salad, and as far as Caesar salads go was top notch. The big flakes of Parmesan were a great addition, and the homemade croutons were so much better than from a bag. The grilled chicken was also a nice addition, but not for and extra five dollars. A similar complaint about the three dollar fountain drinks.  Overall, a little over-priced for the numerous add-ons options but a tasty, if expensive, spot for a nice lunch.",

Totally a local hidden gem tucked right next to Durant's on Central. Parking in the back off of Virginia. The main entrance doesn't face Central so it's easy to miss.   Amazing comfort food in a really chilled out atmosphere-unpretentious with super friendly staff. Our server Deena was outstanding! Genuinely kind and sweet, like going home to a family dinner made with love :)  I had the appetizer portion of the fried chicken and I have to say it it one of the best boneless fried chicken breast I've ever had-because you would almost expect it to be dry (you know, right?) and it's perfectly seasoned and so juicy! And the honey drizzle and bbq aoli....OMG YUM! And homemade pickles...  Manhattans from the bar - on point!   Portions are generous without compromising quality.   Even their croutons on the salad were amazing (because they make those too of course!)   Jason, the owner as well as the chef, even came out to say hello since it was our first time in. What a great guy! You can see how passionate he is about the food and this neighborhood. Love going to mom and pop places that still really care. Makes a huge difference!   Will be back to eat our way they the menu and maybe even get dessert next time!   A++++ Go! Your tummy will be very happy",

Ordered the berry turkey sandwich and I was bowled over by how delicious and well balanced it was. The sweetness mixed with the red onion and cheese was just so delicious. The fries they offer are $2 extra but they were worth it. Thick, well seasoned and fluffy, in a word heaven.   We shared the Caipirinha cocktail and oh my goodness, it was fantastic. Citrusy, sweet and such a great price for Sunday bunch as a carafe was only $6!   This place was a total win. If I lived in Phoenix I'd come back often.",

We found Switch based on the reviews from Yelp! From the outside it's so easy to pass. Nothing special about it. I've actually passed there numerous times and never knew it was there!  We entered through the parking lot in the back and walked through the adorable patio, decorated with couches, pillows, umbrellas, etc. Too bad it was scorching outside, or else I would've loved to sit there.  The service here is always incredible. Servers are friendly and do not bother you during your meal. They seemed very informed about the menu and always sound so excited about the daily special lol. The ambiance inside is so relaxing and hip with the blue lights and leather couches to sit back and have a drink on.  The drinks are my favorite part! I've tried the cherry vodka italian soda, sunrise margarita, sangria, and another drink that had lime and mint in it. I'm not one to usually order sangria, but I decided to try theirs since it was the drink of the day, and it was delicious!  They make their drinks strong, let me tell you. No complaints about that!  I love their salads, the lettuce wrap appetizer, and every dessert I've tried has been so delicious! Brownie sundae comes in a huge parfait glass and is layered to perfection! My favorite was the white chocolate blueberry bread pudding. Came with ice cream, caramel sauce, and whipped cream!   Will be going back for happy hour again soon!",

They seated us right away when we arrived and when our waiter came to the table he noticed I was opening gifts and asked if we were celebrating my birthday. After finishing our delicious meals, I had the Provence Chicken Risotto which was delicious as were all the our entrees, our waiter cleared our plates and surprised us with a warm cookie ice cream dessert with a lighted candle on top for us to share. I wish I had gotten his name because his excellent service, along with the incredible food, made for a very memorable night. We will definitely be back.",

Ordered the hamburgers , since the menu had so many options it made us think how could all of the choices be fresh ? The burger turned out to be over cooked and the bun was dry and crumbly. Our server didn't seem too familiar with the me nu or wine list, so we were on our own. Fries were tasty, but disappointing in general.",

Open and serving late too which is a plus since most every decent eatery shuts down by 9 or 10 in this town.",

    "text": "Wow! I'm so disappointed in myself for not dining or even drinking here before now.  We came in for brunch one Sunday. It was too warm for the patio we walked through to get inside, but believe you me I'm counting down the days until the temps are in double digits again to enjoy that beautifully cozy space. Sigh... I was a little sad we wouldn't be able to enjoy the patio but was snapped back into happiness when we walked in to the smell of bacon. Sweet sweet bacon. In case you didn't know, when you walk into a restaurant to the smell of bacon, that means an angel's earned their wings. The restaurant is bright and open and the servers are friendly and helpful.  On to their moneymakers... First off, carafe of mimosas for $6?!?!?!? They are tugging on my heart strings. The carafe holds about 4 mimosas... do the math. (I won't tell you how many the two of us had). Gosh, I love taking advantage of deals. Speaking of deals, pretty much everything on the menu is less than $10. My friend got the special, a tender belly that took 30 hours to prepare. It was $7.95. It came with pickled vegetables that we didn't care for, but I don't like anything pickled. The tender-belly was so tender and delicious. Since we had bacon on the brain, we got a couple sides of bacon between the two of us. (Just like the mimosas, I'll never tell how many). The chef came out to meet the guests whom were after his heart by ordering the tender belly with sides of bacon. Who doesn't love meeting the chef? It really shows that they care about their guests and what they think about their products. I had the quiche of the day that was freaking amazing. We needed something sweet after all that delicious, hearty food; so we shared the cookie dough with ice cream. This is my favorite dessert anywhere... the sort-of baked chocolate chip cookie dough with vanilla ice cream on top. I was in heaven.  This brunch was one of the best I have had ever! I love brunch... It's my favorite meal. I'll definitely have to come back when the nights are cooler and check out the dinner menu on the patio. LalalalalalalaLOVE this place!!!!",

I knew it had to be part of the Fez/Ticoz family (which I consider myself a niece of because i can't get enough!).    My only complaint is that there weren't enough salad choices.... maybe I was unhappy with the selections overall but I had the sangria salad.  It was very good, but not enough fruit and enough lettuce to make 3 salads.  Overall very good.... I'll be back soon!",

The patio looked very nice I bet its the place to be when its cooler. It was kind of empty in here but it was late afternoon. My sis ordered us some Drunken Italian Sodas they were made super strong though usually this would not detour me however I had my child with me and had to drive all the way back home after. Basically it tasted like straight vodka in a giant glass it was a bit much for me mid day and after adding Sprite to it which I stole from my daughter I still couldn't drink it without feeling like I'd be a drunken Mexican after. I didn't understand this drink maybe someone can explain it to me? My sis told me their Sangria was good but I had no idea they made Caipirinha's next time that's what I get no question.  The food: We had the garlic lemon hummus it was really good the ingredients separately didn't have much taste to them but together it was really nice the pita bread was excellent. The kid couldn't stop eating the hummus she got so full she barely touched her mac n cheese so we brought that home along w all the leftover hummus. Now on to the Tejano burger we decided to split. OMG it was so delicous I couldn't put it down and we both regretted having split it w each other. Extra star just for that burger alone you best try it if you haven't son!!!",

I had the Mac and cheese with chicken. Not interesting or special in the least. One table mate had the chicken pot pie galette which was dry and flavorless.

The service is great, the people are extremely nice and accommodating. The food is a bit pricy (hence 4 stars) as you need to ask for sides to go with your mains (i.e. the burger doesn't come with fries, you need to order them separately), but it is always delicious.

As soon as the dish hit the table, my friend immediately ordered another one for himself, and it came out just as quickly. The only issue was that apparently my dish had come out incomplete. Along with the three pork centered items there were supposed to be pickles, red onion and crostinis.  My plate didn't have croistinis, and apparently the difference in the amount of pickles was noticeable by the whole table. We all thought it was kind of amusing and I wasn't upset about it by any means, although I did end up just eating the pate by itself seeing as how I had nothing to spread it onto.   Although the experience was great, by principle I can't give a 5/5 after seeing that much of a dish inconsistency, especially when there was no less than five minutes between each order and it was a monday night around 6pm and slow.  But! I will be back again to try out brunch!",

    "text": "This is definitely a new mom review.  I like this place, but I don't know if this restaurant really wants to be represented as the cool place to hang out with your little kids. My friend and I went to lunch today and we had great customer service from Jake and good food (Lobster Roll and Salad Special), while enjoying the weather on the patio. Our kids were with us and we we were lucky that there were only two kids since they had one highchair and one booster seat for the entire restaurant! I didn't get a good look inside so I don't know if space is an issue, but at least there was a diaper changing station in the women's restroom. So, I guess you should bring your child's own booster seat if you would like to dine here.  Bottom line: Good food, good service, and no one seemed to mind that I used a (clean) child's sock to make a hand puppet to amuse our kids. Just be willing to bring your own booster seat. Or at least one for your kid.",

Several years ago I had an epic mac and cheese gastronomic experience- and since then I have been on a quest for truly great \"gourmet\" mac and cheese.  Haven't had any that fit that description here in Phoenix.  So I Googled it.  Switch's mac and cheese topped a couple of different lists for best mac and cheese in Phoenix- so of course I had to give it a shot.  Was it good?  Oh yeah.  It was very, very, very good.  Go ahead and order it- it might be one of the best dishes they have, and one of the best mac and cheeses you've had.  But was it transcendent?  Will it be calling me back again and again?  No.  Sadly, it didn't reach that level, in my opinion.  I guess Phoenix doesn't have any life-altering mac and cheese.",

Specifically my favorite grilled cheese panini with Gouda was gone which forced me to find something else. (Boo!)  I decided on the Caprese sandwhich and it was PHENOMENAL.  I gave some to my husband because he was still hungry after eating his meal and I knew I wouldn't be able to finish.  He's not a vegetarian and even he liked it.  It was so good I started ordering the Caprese sandwich at other local restaurants and have yet to find its equal.  All other Caprese sandwiches are now compared to the one at Switch.  The atmosphere is always fun.  When I come here for happy hour we usually try to sit outside because they have a cute patio with couches.  The decor inside is a little dark but I like it.",

The drinks are creative, and affordable. The wine selection is good, and also affordable.  Where Switch blows me away every time is the food. Whether you want something light, healthy and refreshing or something over-the-top decadently rich, there are options for you. The cast iron clams are not to be missed, and on a hot day the Spartan pita really satisfies without overdoing it.  When it comes to sides, don't pass on the Mac 'n Cheese, but the one that keeps my mouth watering days after I've had it is the greek feta, cucumber and tomato salad. Talk about refreshing!  The other piece that makes Switch cool is the service, they are really attentive and the staff have definite personalities that make dining here a lot of fun!",

The 4 tacos have the perfect combination of spicy and sweet braised beef rib meat on corn tortillas with Asian hot sauce and tangy slaw. The tacos are accompanied by jalapeno slices and sweet pickles for those who want to \"kick it up a notch.\"   All of my dining companions seemed equally pleased with the mac 'n cheese, burger, salad, and lobster & seafood crepes.

The owners eagerness to right the wrongs alone impressed me they care about their clientele.   Their speciality drinks are good and tasty. Their appetizers are generous. Not overly inventive but satisfying. Dinner as well a good meal. I avoided asking for a substitute (one of the issues only first visit). I can say the lighting was much better and the staff much more friendly and knowledgeable! So kudos. Great improvements. I have to say the dessert was the best I had - not to sweet and a nice ending to the meal.  So thanks for encouraging me to come back.",

Truthfully I haven't been this impressed by a restaurant since last year in CA.   Husband and I walked in as first timers (I think through the wrong door), and right away a nice guy who was also a server I think greeted us within 3 seconds, and asked us where we would like to sit, what we preferred, etc. he brought over waters right away.   Drinks were ordered and came fast. We ordered the Brie appetizer as well as the chicken bite appetizer. SO good! And really big portions for appetizers.    My husband (who I've never seen eat meatloaf before) got the meatloaf and I got the chopped salad with salmon. Amazing!!!! We were both so amazed by the food and may even come back this weekend for brunch, which I've heard great things about .   *i wrote a review last year to a restaurant in San Diego about how I've never had as great of experience like that in AZ..... We now have experienced that in Arizona. Love this place",

The decor fits the area and the crowd likes it as well.  I think what makes this place is the Sat and Sun brunch.  Food comes out looking great, taste matches it as well.  Drink specials are affordable to keep what you had going the night before.  Patio seating is nice and intimate during the fair weather months here in Phoenix.  The only downfall I have for this restaurant is the wine list.  Oh you can be more creative and get better wines that have those clever names!",

Given that I am a big fan of both Ticoz and Fez perhaps this place just works for me like the other two do. I was starving and ordered their classic cheese burger and then got double meat (it's America, why not and it's only another 5 hours on the elliptical). The burger was done medium as I asked, the rest of the plate looked good, the condiments were fresh - all in all a great lunch.  I will go back for certain and I like the fact that it is a different but related menu to the other two siblings - mostly - I was thrilled to see the Guaccummus from Ticoz.",

As another reviewer noted, they seemed really overstaffed last week when I was there for the three tables being waited on.   The two times I've been there - for Sunday brunch and an evening dinner - you could hear a pin drop.  I heard from staff that they're still working on the liquor license (supposed to be happening soon), so perhaps that the newness of the place and light rail construction is keeping people away.  My chicken and prosciutto panini and side salad was pretty good too and it's priced right for what it is at 8.95.  The wait for our food was a bit longer than normal (esp. given there was hardly anyone there and only three tables of people) - about 20 min. or so.  I also ordered a chocolate banana smoothie - which I've had better elsewhere.  I like the interior design of the place, but yes, it is very IKEA-esque.  Their extensive sofa area makes me want to curl up on one of their sofas and read a book sometime.    I'd really like to like Switch more, but it seems to be off to a slow yawning start.  I do hope things improve.",

The space is really nice, half restaurant, half lounge complete with Scrabble and decks of cards.    We started with the hummus which was fantastic just like I thought it would be.  However, I was disappointed with the mozzarella caprese sandwich.  I love sourdough but that pairing with the mozzarella just didn't work....the bread over powered the cheese and we all know that cheese should be the focal point.  I also didn't like the baby greens on the sandwich, just basal would have been perfect.  The Caesar salad that was included, however, was good.  I really liked the iced tea and loved that they give you a huge carafe of it on the table.  Some of lunch companions chose salads which looked very good, I'll probably choose one of those the next time I go back.    We got there at 11:30 but by noon the place was totally packed.",

The only complaint I have is that the waiter didn't keep his personal comments to himself. ie: when i ordered something he said \"well that doesn't surprise me.\"  not cool and i let him know it, maybe he was just having a bad day.  but over all, aside from our lame waiter, good experience and good food =]",

It is especially annoying to have to wait when the restaurant isn't even busy. If only they would realize that people usually order more drinks if they are seated at their table while they are waiting for the rest of their party to arrive. It is a silly policy and they should realize that it will only drive customers away. If their burgers weren't as amazing, I'm sure that I would be turned off and wouldn't return...but I'm a sucker for a good burger!",

I came to Switch tonight to meet a friend who I hadn't seen in.. oh... 15 years? I was so excited to see the nice atmosphere -- much more a lounge, than  bar -- and that's something that's missing in the Valley. The place was cute, the music was the right level and the drink menu was great.  After a caipirinha (ok, well, it really tasted more like a mojito to me, but, whatever - it packed a punch!) and a nice malbec, I can say I truly enjoyed this place. It was a great space to sit comfortably and have a good conversation. The only downside was that the service was slllloooww -- but it was also very friendly, so that wouldn't stop me from recommending this place to anyone. My only surpise was to see that Switch is a breakfast and lunch joint? That struck me as odd, as I'd much rather come here for some nighttime drinks than for a breakfast. But, to each her own....",

The crepe I had was the lobster and seafood crepes.  It was advertised as \"2 large crepes\" but when the dish came out, they looked puny against the big white plate that they were served in.  The crepe filling tasted just OK.  Nothing to write home about.  I couldn't really taste much lobster or shrimp (or notice any difference in texture) because it seemed like the main ingredient in the dish was the bright red \"Krab\" rather than \"crab\".  After the first crepe, I couldn't eat much more, there was something about the flavor and the sauce that really stopped me from wanting to eat the whole thing since it wasn't really that great tasting.  I tried some of the French au jus sandwich and it was also decent.  I wish the sandwich had more beef in it, for it looked like most of the sandwich consisted of toasted bread with just a thin slice or two of beef.  Dessert was interesting.  We had a warm brownie served with coffee ice cream and drizzled with caramel and pretzels.  I wouldn't have thought to use pretzels in a dessert, but the result was a pretty good mix of textures and tastes.  The brownie was delicious and decadent, especially when paired with the ice cream and caramel, contrasting with the saltiness and crunch of the pretzel.",

Honestly, I think this place is just taking a bit longer than normal to get going and come into its own.  I was here twice -  once in the evening when it was totally dead (just me and 3 friends), and once for lunch where it was relatively full but not crowded.  Both times the service was really awkward.  Although I had different wait staff each time, on both occasions I or a companion made requests that went unheard - forcing us to be a little more aggressive than usual about getting their attention.  Is it bad accoustics?  Because the place isn't really that hectic, even during what is probably their busiest time of day.  The food is ok, but it's a lot like Fez and Ticoz in that they stick with offering several variations on just a few select types of dishes.  However, I like that they offer some casual and light choices like a fruit and cheese plate - perfect if you're just hanging out for awhile with friends or clients.  I've also had a salad and a sandwich here, although I can't remember which ones (they were not bad, but obviously forgettable).  The prices are reasonable, but the decor is cheap - so even without getting/tasting the food you already know they're fair.    Overall, I think I'd wait a few months to see if they're still in business, and then recommend another visit.  1/22/08 Update - I went back with friends two weeks ago to find the menu and service greatly improved, so I'm upgrading to 4 stars.",

The burger includes shredded spinach, sun-dried tomato spread, aioli & chipotle sherry dressing, and topped with an onion ring.  I always add goat cheese.  I was hesitant to order a veggie burger, since I eat all types of meat.  I cannot be more happy that I did!  Switch offers modern decor, low lighting, and friendly service.

They seem to have a new chef now, or they really took customer feedback into consideration.   I have been to Switch several times and have found new things on the menu to love. From the delicious and rich Lobster and Crab Puffs to the hearty and filling Apricot BBQ Feta Chicken sandwich. One of my favorite sandwiches is the Mozzarella Caprese Ciabatta. I usually add prosciutto to my sandwich and it makes it THAT much better. Try the sandwich with a side of Sun Dried Tomato Risotto; yum!  Sometimes they have some amazing specials. About a month ago, for brunch, I enjoyed the Chef's Special of Duck Hash. The hash was well made and flavorful. I felt lucky that I came in for a quick brunch that day. He's always thinking something delicious and \"hangover friendly\" on the weekends.   My latest crush is Apricot BBQ Feta Chicken Sandwich. \"Oh, what's that?\", you might ask. Well let me tell you, my friend. That's a sandwich comprised of warm, sliced chicken, a sweet apricot bbq sauce, sauteed spinach, sharp, tangy feta cheese, and a garnish of onion and cilantro (I usually skip the garnish due to personal taste). The sweet and tangy combo is AMAZING. I highly suggest  it.   You might, also, want to give their onion rings a try. I'm not a huge fan of onion rings, but Switch makes some darn good ones.   Did you think I wouldn't comment on their drinks? To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of Switch's drinks. I always have to upgrade my alcohol selection and ask for less syrup in order to avoid Hangover City. When I do order a beverage, I tend to go with a Drunken Italian Soda.   If you're looking for a nice lunch or dinner spot that isn't too hard on the pocket book, give Switch a try. Their affordable, and creative meals will make you make that Switch!",

Of course it's good for all other meals as well but I try to stay away from the office when I don't have to be there.  Can someone say ambiance please? Aaaaahmbiance... This place is beautiful day and night. The ocean blue calming effect just consumes you when you walk in. Have a seat by the windows for the best food photos. Or have a seat toward the center of the restaurant for a more intimate/cozy feel.   Service here is alwasy amazing! The servers are alway pleasant, smiley, and patient when you're undecided!   Lettuce wraps are amazing. I've had them with both the lamb and the chicken. My favourites are tied at first; Buffalo Bleu Chicken and Spicy Bleu Burger. Yes, I love bleu cheese. All the burgers are really good though. I love them. Really.  Eat here. If you are thinking about it and you haven't or even if you have and you just want to basque in the deliciousness. You can trust me. I love good food.",

The side salad had a very strange tasting house dressing/vinaigrette drizzled on top. I would choose a different side next time but definitely worth a second visit. The service was fine, my companion was a bit disenchanted before I arrived due to the fact the server seemed completely shocked she was waiting to meet someone....odd but will give it another whirl.",

    "text": "This place is awesome...really great atmosphere.  I've only been here twice (in the evenings) but both times it's been relatively quiet, not super crowded.  Definitely an intimate environment.  Dimly lit.  The outdoor seating area looks cozy, though we've never actually sat out there.  Inside, there's a long bar with stools on either side that works well for large groups.  The vibe is relaxed, urban cool.  Staff is friendly, attentive, and welcoming.    I feel like a bit of a fraud writing reviews for restaurants because it seems I rarely actually order food...but all my friends have been super pleased with their orders.  The happy hour pricing is really good, I want to say there are appetizers for, like, $3?  I had a delicious drink special there, it had mint in it.  Not all that strong, but certainly tasty.    As mentioned in another review, it can be difficult to find this place if you're a first-timer.  Parking is around back and you can enter the restaurant by walking through the outdoor seating area to the rear entrance, which feels strange.  But once inside, you should find that a host is stationed right there to greet you.  Switch is a new fave when we venture downtown...check it out, for sure!    (PS, be sure to check in through Yelp when you're there to get $10 off your next bill of $50 or more.  Yay for that!)",

What a greal lunch I had, let me just say. I called in my takeout order about 1045, and they were able to get the order in right away!  I went with the Buffalo Bleu Chicken Sandwich. ( I was going to go for the Lobster roll, but the guy that answered the phone told me that it was a mix that they ordered and had the Krabstick...eww). My sandwich was shaved chicken with buffalo sauce, field greens. Aioli, tons of blue cheese on an awesome roll. It comes with a caesar salad, and I shelled out the extra 2 bones for an additional side of  Mac and Cheese. The sandwich was perfect, exactly how a sandwich should be! The meat was cooked perfectly, there was tonnnnns of blue cheese and the bread will be the reason I don' t have a six pack haha    The Mac and Cheese was also super good, I almost decided to jsut eat that and half of my sammy. It wasn't all gooey like some mac and cheese, which I prefer. It was made with penne and was just what I was looking for.   I didn't eat the caesar salad, I was too full. Wifey will polish off the salad and the rest of the mac tonight while I'm at school. I ended up shelling out 15 bucks with tip!  What  a deal, for teh amount of food and the quality I got. Looking forward to going back with the wife for drinks and apps. I now have a new favorite spot in Cen-Pho!!!",

We were recommended this place by someone at the hotel (she even repeated it after I informed her we were kind of foodies and really wanted something great.) We were a little worried about how large and diverse the menu was, though in hind-sight we were mistaken. We started with Crispy Risotto Croquettes, the day's flavor was Lemon Asparagus. Lightly breaded with a Lemon Garlic Aioli. Creamy soft inside. We were well on our way in to a great meal. Then a couple of sandwiches. Muffin was hankering for a burger, so she went with the Cowboy Burger. Well balanced, little tang from the BBQ sauce, burger cooked perfectly. I went with the Southern Dump Truck. Chicken Thighs, homemade pickles, vidalia onion jam and more. It was either going to be really good or really bad. Again my fears were misplaced. What a great blend of flavors and textures. About the only disappointment was the side of Mac and Cheese. It seemed like a slight upgrade from velveeta shells and cheese. We were curious as to why the same person who made pickles from scratch had decided on such a simple Mac and Cheese. That's when we discovered (from talking to our friendly server) that the real way to experience the dish was with Bacon or chicken and then Baked (that is there Entree version). Now it all made sense.  All in all, a great meal in which you could taste the chef's desire to serve up delicious food prepared with care/",

I especially like the  screwdriver and cape cod $3 carafes they offer on Saturday and Sunday mornings. I've tried many items from their menu and have never been disappointed.  The reason I did not give 5 stars is because my most recent visit: Met a group of 5+ friends & we were told that we'd have to dine outside on the patio due to the large number in our party and no tables available inside. I understand that it was a weekday/lunch hour, however it was hot.  Nonetheless, all my previous visits to Switch have been fun, budget friendly & an enjoyable culinary experience!

The decor is very nice and they have a small outside patio. Being it a wine bar I decided to try the house red wine on happy hour. The server said he wouldn't recommend that. He said it compares to the wine at the bottom shelf at the grocery store. I thought this was weird because a place advertising itself as a wine bar I would expect high quality. He suggested tempranillo.  It was ok. I also tried the malbec. It was ok. We ordered the brie appetiser. Dissapointing. It was breaded and fried. We also tried lobster crab pastry. It was ok. Needless to say there is nothing that interests me in returning.  If you are in the area go to Corduroy next door! Better wine for sure.",

Zimms took care of us very well and he was such an amazing waiter to wait on us, we didn't even have to ask for our check it was like he read our minds and gave it to us right after..Overall, great food and awesome, awesome service.

My girlfriends didn't have the time to wait for her to come back and extend our lunch hour.    I will say that the bread was to die for, it was the only perk to the whole meal.    Also, our waitress took FOREVER to bring our bill.  Once she gave it to us, it took even longer to bring back our cards.  For a restaurant in a busy downtown area, I would have expected faster service knowing that the majority of the patrons were here on a lunch break.  If a friend suggests this place again, I may go.  However, I'll keep looking around the area for a regular lunch spot.",

My Margarita Sunrise was great and I had lucked out because it was Happy Hour.  The others ordered the Sangria and gave them a thumbs up also.   My dinner consisted of the mac and cheese with smoked turkey, and it turned out perfect with not too much cheese but with a thin crust and lots of good flavor.  The field salad was mainly spinach and was very good for a side salad.  When we first came in you couldn't tell if it was a bar or a bar serving food or a restaurant with a bar.  It is a bit dark but comfortable and not too noisy at the time.  Service was on slow side to begin but improved once the initial order was taken.  Would I come back here?   Yep, the next time back in town we will return and at Happy Hour, of course.",

    "text": "It's hard to believe it's been almost four years since I wrote my first review of Switch. Since then, I've probably been to Switch 25+ times, largely because I now live a few blocks away but also because it's a consistently reliable place for a meal, drinks or both.   Some of my Switch favorites:  *The Mozzarella and Chop Salads - unlike some other local restaurants that will go unnamed, Switch's salads aren't all overly sweet (I am so sick of strawberries and candied walnuts!). These two, in particular, are hearty but still have feel light and fresh. Even the salad that does have the fresh fruit and candied nuts (the House) does a little differently, with fresh blackberries and raspberries and delicious fried onion straws.  *The two seafood appetizers (Lobster/Crab Puffs and the Sesame Shrimp) - the first is rich and really satisfying with a light drink and the shrimp are very fresh and flavorful with an Asian kick.  *The veggie burger - so delicious. We were surprised to find out the veggie burger wasn't made in house because it certainly tastes like it is. It's very filling and doesn't fall apart like most, but still isn't overly formed or artificial.  *Amsterdam Pasta - this is a little heavier than I normally order, but they do a great job making the sauce creamy without overwhelming. Extra points for the truffle oil :) *Cheap-ass brunch carafes - while the size of the carafes has reduced in the past few months, you still can't beat $3 Bloody Mary carafes (serve about 3) and $6 mimosa carafes. How many lazy Sunday afternoons have I spent downing 2 (or 3) of these delicious concoctions.   Some of the improvable aspects of the experience:  *The brunch service experience - while I understand it must be frustrating to serve super cheap carafes, they're on the menu and people are there at your restaurant, instead of somewhere else in CenPho with almost-as-cheap drinks. So suck it up and don't act like I'm some cheapo or that I can't make a request simply because I'm paying a small amount for booze. Last time I went, I asked for a glass with a salted rim with my Bloody Mary carafe and was refused. Another time, my friend asked for pineapple juice in the Cape Cod carafe and got a lot of attitude about \"changing something that's already cheap.\" Even if he were charged extra (which is fine), the server could have just said that and made the whole thing a lot less awkward.  *The overly-sweet specialty drinks - most of their daily drink specials are really sugary, with tons of grenadine and syrups. I wouldn't mind seeing just a good old vodka soda every now and then.  *The martinis - I've ordered a dirty martini a few times there and I never will again. Must be the olive juice?  *The brunch food menu - It's quite small and has few vegetarian options. Could definitely be expanded.   I definitely won't stop going to Switch, especially since it's so close, and I've had so many great experiences there, but I'd like to see them invest a little time in fixing some of the cons.",

The lobster seafood crepe was greasy, creamy and tasteless..with yellow carrots on the side that were tasteless.  Also had a wrap that was nothing to write home about.  Maybe the chef had gone home, but we were pretty disappointed.",

But they won't seat you unless your entire party is there, even if all but 4 tables in the entire place are unoccupied.  There were more people waiting for the rest of their parties than actually sitting in the restaurant.  It annoyed me until half-way through my lunch I saw the entire place was packed and there were people waiting to be seated.  Smart move on their part.    My sandwich: Chicken & Proscuitto- deeelish! It was a big boy.  I had it with fries and ate it all, why oh why did I eat it all?  It's filling and large and I felt in charge after I snarfed it all down.  Our server was quick and friendly, she filled our teas even thought the carafe sat on our table- I loved this by the way.  I can't get enough iced tea these days.  I will be back and I can't wait.",

    "text": "Wow...I don't even know where to start.  (The beginning...that's usually a good place)  So, the little lady and I had just finished up with yoga, and Switch was in the very near vicinity,  so we figured it'd be a good choice.  Wrong.  We were greeted in a somewhat timely fashion and seated.  Then we waited for a while...and then a little more.  The hostess was wiping off a nearby table and asked if we had been helped yet, and when we said no, she went to find our server.  Apparently he didn't know we were his table.  Ok, it's happened to me before, I'm willing to forgive.  Our server, Chris, came over and we ordered our food and drinks.  He came back with our bevs and then he didn't stop by again until food came out, meanwhile we had pushed both of our empty water glasses and my empty coffee mug to the end of the table...hoping that he would get the hint.  Nope.  Then the food came and he finally asked if we wanted more to drink.  He dropped off water and coffee and was gone until the END of our meal (which wasn't even good).  Was this a joke?  He comes over and says \"So, how is everything guys?\" My woman replied with \"I've had better, can we please get the check?\" and he didn't even ask what was wrong.  He brought the check and we were going to split it down the middle, and he said they were having system issues and couldn't split it.  Fine, one card...just get us the eff outta here!  When he brought the card back he literally tossed it on the table and told us to have a good day as he was walking away.  Yeah, where's the manager?  I told the manager all about our sucky experience and our even suckier server.  I was given some excuse that their computer systems were down due to a hacking of sorts and blah blah blah...give me a break.  I understand things running a bit slow due to a computer problem, but NEVER coming to check on our meal and us having to ask a different server to please get us condiments and then to not even acknowledge when we tell you we've had better...that's not a computer issue.  That's a server who doesn't care about good business and doesn't know how to do his job.    We were given a comp card for the next time we come in, but really I doubt that will happen.   It's a shame, because I really do love supporting local gay businesses.  But they make it so damn hard with their declining service and mediocre food.  Switch, our relationship must come to an end, because when it comes down to it...it's not me, it's you.",

I had a glass of Malbec with my Apricot BBQ feta chicken panini, delicious and the thick potato wedges were awesome, it hit the spot.  My husband had the Jalisco Chicken Panini, another winner.  He also had the Caipirinhas, they were really good.  Next time I am having a couple of those. Can't wait to check it out for brunch.",

For entrees we got a salad, chicken with pesto risotto, and salmon - all of which tasted really good!  There are lots of vegetarian options on the menu, but when I tried to modify them to be vegan (ie: no cheese, no mayo, no cream) the server told me the dishes wouldn't taste good and discouraged me from getting them.  For dessert we got the \"big cookie\" (half-baked cookie dough baked into the dish with ice cream on top) and the brownie with coffee ice cream, carmel and pretzels.  The brownie dish was way better but both of were pretty good.  The service, on the other hand, was AWFUL.  Took our order fairly quickly, but only after we had finished the appetizer did our server come out and ask us to clarify something about the order, so obvi he hand't even put it in yet.  Our empty plates sat in front of us for WAY too long, my to go box never came so I had to stare at a plate of chicken while eating my brownie dessert!  And of course it took forever to have him pick up and process our check.  Even though the food was good, it's not good enough to make me come back here and endure the painful service.",

My husband tried the breakfast mac and cheese and added bacon, he also enjoyed his but found that it had a lot of breadcrumbs and because of the way the dish was served it was difficult to mix them in the rest of the dish so he got mouthfuls if it at the beginning of he meal. We had a hard Arnold partner and tequila sunrise, both very good and a great deal for brunch time carafes. We will be back for sure!",

    "text": "Visiting Phoenix from Ohio. I stayed across the street from Switch. Looked over their menu online and once I saw the Brie wedge I knew I had to try this place out. I was not disappointed. I sat at the bar, when I walked in Cavs Game 6 was on the tv so it was an easy choice. The restaurant has an inviting modern atmosphere. I was greeted by the bartender, who was very welcoming, easy to talk to and makes a great Old Fashioned. The Chef brought out fresh, house made Pork Rinds with house seasoning. If this was the only thing I ate at Switch, I would have been more than satisfied.   I started my meal with the Brie wedge. If you are a fan of baked Brie, as I am, you owe it to yourself to try this dish. It comes out golden brown and with a perfectly crisp outside. The wedge is topped with thin slices of Granny Smith apple, walnuts and a habanero shallot honey that is good enough to drink. Fresh sliced strawberries and thin sliced bread, toasted to perfection, finished out this plate. This dish was delicious. The creaminess of the Brie, the crunch of the crust and sweetness honey are perfectly balanced with the late kick of heat from the habanero.   Moving on to my main dish. On special tonight was a 6oz Bison Burger, pressed out diner style, with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, chopped red onion, pickle and house made secret sauce on a toasted bun. This burger can be best described as Chef Jason's passion on a plate. The flavors in this burger are second to none. The bison was juicy and beautifully seasoned. Such an amazing burger.   Overall I would say experience at Switch was first class all the way. From the service to the food and the restaurant itself, this place is top notch. Great atmosphere, great food and great, friendly service.   Chef Jason, thank you for taking the time to sit and talk with me tonight. It is moments like that that are why I love eating at local places when I travel.   Switch is a must try. I know I will be going back!",

Service was excellent, very informative, friendly and attentive to detail. We shared the fried green tomatoes (OMG!), baked brie, split an order of their Tuesday fish and chips special and ended with the bread pudding. All the apps and the entree were incredible, their french fries are to die for. Bread pudding was slightly disappointing but I think it may have been \"nuked\" in the micro so some of it was pretty tough but the flavor was good. Had to work later so I didn't have any cocktails but they looked wonderful also. Adorable patio and cool bathrooms, loved the ambiance and will definitely return. The entire staff was just fantastic!",

    "text": "We visited Switch last week on a Sunday afternoon.   When we arrived, the restaurant was empty except for a larger (loud, drunk) party at a hightop table and another couple in the corner. We entered through the patio out back, and sort of wandered around looking for a host or a sign to seat ourselves.  Once seated, I had to ask for the brunch menu, as there was only 15 minutes left to order off of it (which I was reminded 2 separate times over the course of 2 minutes.)  I ended up ordering off the lunch menu to make things easier; the brunch selections were limited and a bit uninspired anyway. I chose correctly, because our lunches were fantastic.  My boyfriend ordered the Very Berry Turkey sandwich and basically hasn't shut up about it since. (Later in the week we traveled to New Orleans and stopped at a well-known sandwich place, and in describing how his meal was, he just ended up complaining that it wasn't as good as the one he got at Switch.) He ordered the street corn as his side, and upon seeing it was worried it would be too rich and creamy. After eating it, he dedicated a full five minutes to waxing poetic about how great it was.   I had the switch burger and it was crazy good. To be honest, I swapped out the Canadian bacon for regular bacon, and it was unbelievable. The goat cheese, the fig, everything. Super juicy and huge.   We left feeling very gluttonous and very satisfied.",

    "text": "Wow, this is not the same Switch we ate at 5 years ago! Well, it's in the same spot,  same name, but that's about it. I liked the old Switch, but we Loved the new one:  Apparently there was a change of ownership a while back, and they doubled the size of the place. Gone is the hipster vibe with the tattooed and ear-spooled wait staff. Gone are the plastic menus. Also gone are the reasonable prices, but the food is even better than I recall. Ditto for the drinks.  Had a honey butter old fashioned. Heresy,  I know,  but the flavors just made me smile.  For entrees we had a salad and the buttermilk fried chicken.  That boneless chicken was accompanied  by an incredible garlic mash, a veg mix that was unusual and delicious and a white gravy that was anything but ordinary. The flavors just knocked me out.  Note to chef : give the chicken a minute less in the deep fryer, 'kay?  They seem to be aiming for the lunchtime business crowd, judging by the folks around us, and the fact that I felt a bit underdressed after a morning of sightseeing. A few of those business types must have been on expense accounts, given that with drinks, dinner, tax and tip, the bill was pushing 90 bucks. To be fair, they did offer many cheaper lunch options, but I had to try the chicken.   Expensive,  not really, given the quality.   Our waitress,  who seemed to be the oral historian of the place, was sweet as pie.   We\"'ll be back the next time we're visiting the Heard Museum which is just down the street.  But next time I'll wear a collared shirt and leave the hoodie in the car..",

Would imagine the lite up patio pretty for evening patio drinks.   We were greeted and sat right away. Cute roomy booths and some high top tables closer to the long bar.   We ordered brunch and lunch & these portions are huge! Had I know I would have shared. I started with a Cesar salad and it was so creamy and delicious. This place makes all their dressings from scratch.   My friend got the green chili benedict. She said it was full of flavor but needed more green chili. The breakfast potatoes are tossed in some Cajun seasoning and it was yummy!   I got the Asian BBQ chicken sandwich. Huge sandwich! I only ate half and took the rest home. The flavor was a sweet more watery bbq sauce, not thick like a regular bbq restaurant. Still very flavorful with the feta and aioli.   Over all a good experience. The prices are a little expensive but for the portion makes sense.   Check this place out.",

Do you really think you can be that rude to people when they sit down and expect them to stay?  We got up and left, and I will not return.

When we first walked in, the snippy guy at the Host station told us it would be 10 minutes before he could seat us. He said this as we were looking out over a half-empty restaurant. When we asked him why we would have to wait when the place was half empty, he replied that he was just doing his job, then sashayed away.  When we did finally get to a table (place was still half empty), we waited quite a while to get a waiter. Waited an additional long time to get the food, then our waiter disappeared. We finished our meal without drink refills, and 20 minutes after we finished our meal, we had to ask another server to find ours for us to get the check. He showed up 5 minutes later and dropped off the check, then came back 10 minutes later to get our card to pay.  As we tried to leave after paying, the main walkway was blocked by another server talking to people at a table. When we tried to go past him, he moved into our path more. So we had to turn around and go around the perimeter of the restaurant to get to the door that started out 10 feet from us.  Ultimately, I won't go back. The staff was rude... every single one of them that we interacted with. Food was only okay, and overpriced.",

Our server was great, attentive and friendly. Unfortunately, I don't remember our appetizer, what my boyfriend had, and only remember that I had wine to drink, but not sure what kind. I'm sure it was great, but honestly I'm not that hard to please when it comes to wine! What really stood out that made me want to write a review months later was the lobster Mac n cheese! It was a generous portion, perfectly moist, and the lobster was in light flakes so each bite had lobster, but it didn't overpower the dish. There are a ton of restaurants in this area, so it's difficult to stand out in the crowd, but Switch definitely accomplishes this feat!",

    "text": "I had the best culinary experience of my 8 years in Phoenix tonight. First time at Switch. Started off with some appetizers; pesto & sun dried tomato risotto, marinated chicken breast, Mac n cheese. All delicious!    Next my wife orders the blackened salmon. I looked at her with my wtf scowl. We don't even eat seafood. \"It looks interesting\" she says. Whatever. It gets to the table and it's the biggest hunk of salmon I've seen. We simultaneously stab into it with our forks, take a bite, and we look at each other like the first time we fell in love. The combination of the salmon, bacon and sauteed greens was out of this world. Coupled with the bread pudding and sweet tomato concoction put me over the top.   We let the waitress know what we experienced and to thank the chef. She brought him out and he spoke with us for about 15 minutes. Jason is touched by the hand of God. He proceeded to tell us what he had planned for tomorrow's dinner menu and we made reservations on the spot for tomorrow night.   I never knew food could profoundly affect your mood but I was driving home singing my heart out to my iPod. Got home, plugged the iPod into the stereo and continued the concert, danced with my dog and made me a latte.  Perfect night.    Thank you Jason and Switch.",

Our server, Cynthia, was downright amazing - so professional, polite and on top of everything.  The food was truly fantastic too.  I enjoyed the very berry turkey sandwich with a caesar salad and ate everything - half the sandwich and the salad for lunch and the other half of the sandwich for dinner last night along with the potato, corn and bacon chowder that my out of town friend couldn't eat.   Absolutely great menu and I can't wait to come back again!",

Service was attentive, and the food was pretty good. Sage ordered the Switch Burger, and I chose the East Port Lobster Roll. We didn't order any cocktails and instead had the Blueberry Sage Tea. I'm now a fan, and I'm coming back to try their brunch.",

    "text": "I went to Switch with my husband to celebrate the anniversary of the day we met. We were looking for a spot downtown to eat that wouldn't cost too much and decided to try Switch.  The location is nice and the atmosphere is great. they have a patio out back and an open dining room with strategically-placed decor to create a more intimate feeling.  To start, we ordered the sun dried tomato risotto. The portion was much larger than I expected for $3.95 but the dish was just okay. I tried the martini of the night but didn't like it so we switched drinks. For the main course I had the chicken pot pie galette and my husband had the turkey and brie galette. I really liked mine but there were too many veggies in it. A good chicken pie needs only flaky pastry, rich gravy and tender chicken--not peas, corn and tomatoes. The seasonal side dish was sauteed pea pods with onions. It was unexpected and surprisingly delicious. My husband's galette was good. In fact, it was even better than mine.   You're probably wondering why I'm giving this place four stars and the answer is SERVICE! Since moving to Phoenix, I've found most places lack skilled wait staff and management who know how to effectively run a place and take care of their customers. Our waiter was a little late bringing my second drink. I'd only just started to wonder what was taking so long when he showed up with the drink and said it was on him. I don't remember his name but he had a killer mustache. Taking care of your customers makes them want to come back even if they didn't like everything they ordered.  I'll definitely go back to Switch. They have amazing specials every day and their burgers looked delicious. Go to this place!",

Server was prompt but mostly ignorant about the menu.  Right away, I ordered what Switch calls a Caipirinha.  It's not.  A real Caipirinha is made with cachaca and Switch makes their drink with rum and vodka.  But it was tasty and the ingredients were accurately listed on the menu, so I wasn't really disappointed.  As an appetizer, my friend and I split baked lobster and crab mac n' cheese.  I enjoyed this.  I wouldn't rave about it, but I would -- and did -- happily eat it.  At this point, I would have rated Swtich a solid three stars.  I wish I had left then.  Instead, my friend and I each ordered burgers.  Without overstatement, mine was the worst burger I have ever had.  I ordered it medium and it came very well done, nearly charred.  The bacon was burnt black.  The red wine glaze (which I was intrigued by on the menu) tasted nothing like what I expected.  It tasted like red wine vinegar thickened with corn starch.  I ate less than half of my burger.  My friend had a similar experience.  But instead of red wine glaze, he got a burger with guacamole.  His burger was cooked to order at medium rare, but he said that the beef was low quality and without much flavor.  The guacamole on his burger was sour.  How does that happen?  Based on the lackluster start to the meal before things became horrible, we decided to cut our losses and never return.  In the end, there is nothing special about Switch and some of it is down right awful.  I suggest avoiding it.",

    "text": "Maybe this review should actually be 5 stars... I can't really think of a reason Switch *doesn't* earn 5 stars, but in this age of grade inflation, I must be judicious with my stars.  So yes, 4 stars, but if I could give half stars (and, why, Yelp, can I not?!), I would give this place 4.5 stars.    I've been here a handful of times and just LOVE it!  The ambiance and decor is cool and modern, with a staff and clientele that are more down-to-earth than the hip decor would suggest.  I love the variety of seating options, from a great patio, to a long shared table, to a bar, to laid back armchair seating configurations, to hightop tables, to typical half bench, half chair tables.  There's a seating situation to suit everyone here.  But that's not why we go to restaurants, is it?!  The food.  So good. So so good.  Admittedly I've only tried two entrees-- the triple grilled cheese and the mozzarella caprese sandwich, but that's because they're both so awesome that I find it hard to branch out.  They have a tempting veggie burger that I keep vowing to try... maybe next time!  This place has great selections for herbivores and omnivores alike-- my meat-eating dining companions have enjoyed burgers and sandwiches that they continually bestow with high praise. With sandwiches and burgers, you get your choice of sides-- all of which are delicious, but the mac n' cheese is out of this world.  Creamy and delicious and addicting.  And served with a sandwich, you'll certainly have plenty leftovers for lunch the next day- and who doesn't love that?  As an appetizer, I almost always start with the hummus which is delicious!!  Just perfect-- great texture, great seasoning, not too much or too little of anything.  The portion is large and it's served with plenty of warm pita bread, so order this one to share between two or more people.  It' s served with some pickled red peppers and artichokes that I don't care for, but I just push those to the side and dive in.   And the drinks-- so so delicious!  And their happy hour is fantastic- two for one.  Plus they have a great all-day drink special each day of the week.  They serve the unique 'drunken italian soda', a potent and sweet concoction that doesn't disappoint.  Last night I had the red sangria and it was also fabulous!  The sunrise margaritas are also fantastic.  Basically the cocktails are unique, flavorful, potent, and reasonably priced-- who could ask for anything more?  The service is generally pretty good-- a solid 3-4 stars. Never stellar, never horrible.  Just decent.  This is probably where they lose the half star-- but not because it's bad, just because it isn't as awesome as the food, cocktails, or ambiance.   So it's settled... in my book, this place is a 4.5 and I'll be back again and again and again.",

Unfortunately for me, she is not a big fan of Sunday Brunch, so when we did finally make it there last Sunday, I had already missed out on the brunch menu and the $3 carafes of Bloody Marys.   We ordered a carafe anyways... only $6 for approximately 4 good sized Bloodys! They were made well, but for the most part tasted pretty generic, yet still exactly what I expected for only $6!! I ordered one of the tastiest burgers I've ever eaten, topped with guacamole, salsa and jalapenos! Each plate was also served with a small house made ceasar salad, which I thought was a nice touch! Our service was very prompt and friendly!  I will definitely be coming back to Switch for my favorite meal of the week: BRUNCH :)",

    "text": "I expect nothing less from Switch.  When my friends, in from out of town, asked for a nice but casual place to have a late dinner, I recommended we meet here.    We had a great seat on the patio and attentive service. The house cosmos, $3 on Saturday, were potent and tasty. Our party of 7 had everything from salads to burgers to lobster mac n cheese.  I had the Bbq grilled chicken skewers.  Perfect dinner, I especially enjoyed the cucumber salad with balsamic vinegarette accompanying the skewers.  AJ and Jeremy talked about their huge and tasty burgers into the next day. I sampled the lobster mac it was very rich and tasty.  We closed down the place but each of my visitors vowed that next time they were in PHX, Switch was on their list.",

Love this place so much I was taking my boyfriend out there to just enjoy a night out with some live theatre after wards and he PROPOSED to me there!! Not only do I have a restaurant in Phoenix that I love, but now it has even better memories there!   The staff is always nice and helpful and cheerful! It's a place that is kept clean all the time!   I found it a few years ago with a group of my girlfriends and fell in love with the ambiance, the food, the hummus!!!! Since then I've taken many people there and suggested it to others so I figured i should write up a review on Yelp!   Absolute favorite.",

Our server was extremely personable and had a great sense of humor.  i would go back just for her. The food selections were varied, and anyone could find something they like.  The pannini's and pita sandwiches were great.  You will need a doggie bag. They have an area with lounge seats and a long table that looks perfect for having cocktails and appetizers.  I would like to come back in the evening to experience that. Overall, reasonable prices, trendy atmosphere, great service, and a menu that would suit anyone's taste.",

For the price, you can't expect fresh OJ or very good champagne - but it still hit the spot on late Sunday morning.  The sauce on the eggs was well done and the poached eggs were perfectly prepared, so even if the ham was from a pre-sliced package and the muffin not very toasted, the morning was lovely, the service was professional and friendly, and I will return to enjoy myself again.",

I came in the entrance  off Central and was a little disoriented - guess they aren't used to people coming in that way.  After a minor amount of confusion I was on my way out to the patio.     I tried the $1.99 drink special - a Caipirinha, Very refreshing and large!  I also ordered the Mac n Cheese and had them add the baked lobster and crab.  Oh My God - now I am not a mac n cheese aficionado however this was incredible!  I wasn't able to finish it and asked for a box.  Then they asked if I wanted dessert - even though I really shouldn't have, I ordered the vanilla creme brulle'.  Ding, ding, ding - another winner!  I wish I would have tried this place earlier I would have eaten there more.   I know I am going to be jonesing for their mac n cheese.",

We love the paintings on the walls.  We usually get a table next to the window along Central Ave. and it's great to watch the world go by while you dine with those you adore!  For me, that's my lovely wife.   I've sampled quite a bit of the menu at Switch.  The Red Sangria is amazing, as are the crepes.  We love the seafood crepes and the Ham and Cheese crepes as well.  I've also had the cowboy burger which is quite good and the French Dip is incredible also.  Lately, we've fallen in love with the fruit and cheese plate.  The fig jam is AMAZING! (edit: I forgot the candied walnuts!  How could I forget the candied walnuts?  You gotta try the candied walnuts!) :-)  Whether there are just a couple of you, or a whole group, Switch can accommodate.  The only thing I'd change about Switch would be not to charge extra if you want to \"switch\" something like fries for the Caesar salad.  But that's just a personal preference.  Good Stuff here!",

I walked in thinking that I was just going to have a couple of drinks, but when I saw that they had an individual starter and sides section in the menu I got excited!  So that means that I can try several different items without completely breaking the bank?  I started with the sun dried tomato risotto.  OMG...loved it!  Will go back for that.  I was actually full after that, but indulged and ordered another one!  I also ordered that and the mac and cheese too!  The mac and cheese was good, but I really wanted to lick my bowl after the risotto.  My husband ordered the Switch burger that was recommended by our wonderful server.  Delicious!  It's at the top of my list for best burgers!  They have a great happy hour with certain drinks at less than $4 and an appetizer option for a discounted price.  Our server Josh was great and the ambiance was contemporary too.  I will be bringing my friends here!",

The other girls had a Red Sangria, a red wine loaded with fresh fruit (berry's, and apple), it was looking very yummy... .....   It's a very nice lounge/restaurant/bar but I'm not a big fan of the 'sandwich menu'.

I used to loathe the fact there weren't many quality restraunts in the area where I work on Thomas and Central till I found Switch. They opened 2 months ago and feature a variety of sandwiches baked fresh everyday. You can find turkey and a variety of meat, humus, prusciutto, murano chicken etc...all outstanding, the salads are great too.  There is a large communal table/ bar right in the center of the restraunt, and the room is beautifully decored in 21st century Noveu! There is also a large outside seating area between 2 walls which creates somewhat of a courtyard that opens to the back parking lot.  It is absolutely delightful to dine with professionals in this al fresco setting.  I love the fact you can sit anywhere without being shown to your seat, just look for the blue card that seat is open. Service is prompt too and the staff is well trained.  I was surprised how busy it's been when I've gone there, apparently word has gotten round.   You can check the entire menu on their website, <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.switchofarizona.com&s=614bd555811581ea6729f86afe5904b162cc8175b483f41df2c96b6706dc2bba\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">switchofarizona.com</a> A must for anyone having lunch in the uptown Phoenix district on Central Ave. They are open till 11PM too. Can't wait for happy hour.",

They had a turkey sandwich, with fresh, handmade strawberry jam, that was so delicious, and reminded me of a Monte Cristo, but not fried. I could eat one of these every day!  The location is very convenient for light rail, and is close enough to downtown.  The beer selection was \"ok, the drunken italian soda was really nice, and sneaks up on you, but the Caipirinhas were simply fantastic.  I'm thinking I may have to try their brunch, before I make a solid determination about our future together.  But I really enjoyed the TweetUp, and my impression of Switch moved up quite a bit.",

    "text": "I'm ranking this primarily on the food and what I think is some great potential... also based on the fact that I really want them to do well.  Anyway, I've been to Switch I think five or six times now in the past month (whenever I'm in Phoenix for work) mainly because it's about 2 blocks from the office. I've done both take-out and dine-in, and have only come away with questionable service once. Even then, the food is spot-on. In the evenings, the whole area is sorta dead, especially with the light-rail construction, so I'm sure that's not helping out. But the several times I've been there for lunch, it's been pretty packed and have even had to wait for a table once or twice (just a few minutes).  So, so far...  Appetizers: - Garlic hummus. the waiter says it's \"kick ass,\" and it was. Love the roasted pepper and artichokes on the side - Turkey Mac'n'Cheese. Wasn't my favorite, but pretty creamy nonetheless.  Salads and Soup: -Sangria Salad with chicken (you can add chicken, beef, turkey, ham, tuna salad, salmon, or lobster salad to any of the salads). Anyway, rather fruity with grapes, apples, and strawberries. Great flavor combination. -Super Chop Salad with lobster. Stuff is just piled on. Love it. In general, the salads are pretty big and filling. Only gotten the soup of the day (which changes regularly as the name implies). Had a duck and mushroom soup the other day. A little on the salty side, but I can't say no to duck and mushroom in anything.  Entrees: - Puff Pastry Galletes. Have tried the prosciutto, mozzarella, pesto and tomato galette which is mouth-watering, as well as the - Chicken Pot Pie Gallete. Chicken pot pie may be one of my favorite things in the world, and this definitely hits the spot. They also have savory crepes, a pasta, and meat and fish dishes.  Sandwiches: - Ibiza Sangria Chicken. Friend ordered this, but the waitress was a little frazzled it seemed, so we ended up getting the sangria salad instead. Problem was corrected pretty quickly. Maybe she was new. Anyway, sandwich looked good (roast chicken with apples, grapes, goat cheese, etc.) - Eastport Lobster Roll. Lobster and seafood salad, roast corn and other veggies. Clean flavors, very refreshing - Parmesan Caesar Turkey Pita - basically a caesar salad with roast turkey and tomato, stuffed in a pita. Pretty good, but the turkey was just a tad salty for my tastes.  Oh yeah, love their cookies too. They have some and other simple stuff at the honor bar, so you just take and pay in a jar. See how much they trust you? :D Even then, the staff have given me free cookies here and there while waiting or when we got a wrong order once.  Anyway, you can see I've tried a good sampling of their menu, but there are like 10 other entrees, about 20 sandwiches, and a handful of other appetizers and salads, not to mention an entire breakfast menu, plus more cocktails, coffees, italian sodas, and smoothies. Maybe their tactic is to get someone like me to come in and eventually try everything on the menu. So far it's working :P",

Some things I wish could be better (holding out for that 5th star):  - it's always dark in there.  i need my readers to read the menu, makes me feel OOOOLD. -  A couple of dishes missed the mark:  the grilled cheese pannini SOUNDS sooo good: cheddar, gouda and jack cheese winds up being an overwhelming big fat clot of cheese, I couldn't choke it all down. -  None of the seating is really super comfy.  It's all FINE, but... hmm, I dunno, just not seats could spend hours in comfort. - Ladies room is very basic; doesn't seem like it was remodeled with old, poorly functioning TP dispenser - one square at a time, ugh.

    "text": "Mediocre... that's the best I can give this place. Maybe I'm jaded, maybe my expectation levels are too high, maybe I give accurate reviews that are not influenced... who knows.   I have been coming to Switch since the day they opened the new dining room and were serving 1/2 priced entrees (due no liquor licence). In my opinion, they never progressed or evolved. I never suggest this place when going out, but for some reason, my friends who live in the 'hood like the food here. What disappoints me is the fact that we walk right past Durant's to get here... my heart drops every time, knowing that I could be in Durant's enjoying a really great meal.   Here at Switch...I personally... love..love...LOVE  the Italian Sodas (Drunken sodas) .. tall, frosty fruit flavored vodka drinks, that are made like and taste like an Italian soda.. AWESOME! ( Even better during happy hour for half the price). Aside from the sodas... I can honestly say that I've only had one excellent meal here... and that was many years ago and they have since taken the item off the menu. (Sliced grilled fillet in a yummy cream based sauce).. everything else on the menu is pretty ordinary and not worth ordering again.   I've eaten most everything on the menu in search of SOMETHING that I would really enjoy and would order more that once... I have yet to find it.. the only items that I will order is the bruschetta Duet, Hummus and the cheese and fruit plate. All of them are fresh, tasty and of generous size.   Someday..... soon I hope..... I want to find something soooo yummy on the menu, that  it will be me that suggests Switch as my choice for dinner... until then, I will continue to search...",

It was a little chilly outside so we sat inside, but the outside patio looked amazing.  The inside of Switch was very modern and had a cool vibe to it.  I started off with a Red Switch Sangria Cocktail which was infused with Apples, Blueberries and Strawberries, and ordered the Fresh Mozzarella Salad for my dinner which included roma tomato, basil pesto, garlic croutons, olives, red onions, field greens and of course Mozzarella toped with a balsamic honey vinaigrette.  The drink and the dinner were quite tasty. Can't wait to go back when I visit Phoenix again!!!",

    "text": "I work VERY close to Switch so come here often when employees are in town or just going out to have lunch with boss, etc.  I've never had a bad experience here - I don't find the wait staff to be overly nice but not rude either. They ask me what I want, i tell them and i get it!  Unlike several other reviews I find their menu to be good - it is an American restaurant afterall so naturally they serve sandwiches, salads, soups, other similar entrees.  I also don't agree that their food is bland - and I'm the type of person to go out on a limb to try new things and I like bold foods.  I really like the hummus app here, however I never have tried it at Fez so might need to get over there soon.  At different times I've had sandwiches, salads and most recently the gallette.  So far all have been good.  The gallette is a flaky pastry filled with some sort of meat, cheese and veggie. As expected it was a little oily but very good too. Came with asparagus cooked just how I like it.  I really don't have any complaints about the place.  Perhaps it's because it is the closest restaurant to our workplace so feel loyal, or maybe because I only come here over the lunch hour and b/c it is lunch hour don't expect much? Whatever the case, I enjoy Switch.",

Seemed like a perfect set up not only for couples, but also perfect for a double date.  We weren't super hungry, so ordered a couple of drinks to get us started.  Mrs. had one of their Drunken Italian Sodas.  She really liked it.  The specialty drink menu seemed to lean to the girly sweet kind of drinks, so I just ordered a gin & tonic.    The service was attentive and friendly. While ordering a second round ( She really like the \"sodas\"), we decided to try a bite.  Ended up ordering, and fully enjoying, the garlic & lemon hummus.  The hummus was very tasty and the pita triangles were super soft and hot.    In all, we enjoyed our quick little trip to Switch.  Would recommend it for any type of gathering, date or a group of friends.",

It's located on Central, right next to Durant's, but I had never seen it before. We asked to be seated outside and were pleasantly surprised by the adorably chic patio. It was slightly reminiscent of some of my favorite LA lunch spots.   I ordered the farm basket veggie sandwich and was happy to see that it came with a side salad instead of fries (I never have the self discipline to ask for salad instead of fries if they're the standard side). The veggies were plentiful and fresh, and the salad, while a little bland (cesar dressing on romaine with parmesan shavings), it was still pretty good.   I'll definitely be back and can't wait to try their mac n' cheese!",

The sandwich I ordered was the Southern Dump Truck. It consisted of a boneless chicken thigh that was over cooked, tough to chew, smothered in black pepper and drenched in something called maple Tabasco sauce. The sandwich was too large to pick up, so I cut it in half to make it more manageable.  To my surprise it was like getting two different sandwiches. On one side there was chicken, crispy onion rings, and the maple sauce, on the other half was chicken, bacon, Vidalia onion jam. I couldn't have planned it that way if I tried.  I do have to say the service was good. Plenty of wait staff with the amount of customers for the lunch crowd.  The waitress asked if I would like something other than the sandwich but I explained with time constraints I couldn't wait for something else. It would have been nice of them to offer a discount on the meal but they didn't.  If I return, next time I will order something different.",

    "text": "I hold a special place in my heart for Switch, as it was my first experience with downtown(ish) Phoenix.  ( yeah I haven't lived in the valley of the sun for that long) They were new enough to where they didn't have there liquor license yet on my first go around, but I immediately fell for the place and have gone back several times.  It has some great things going for it that for me at least, outweigh the negatives  The atmosphere is great, very chill and the low lighting makes it a great place for first dates (everyone looks better in the dark!) The crowd generally ranges from your upper 20's and on. Usually more of a metro crowd but you'll see all types in here, which can make the people watching fun, especially if your seated at one of the couches.  The menu has a lot of variety and almost everyone will find something to enjoy. If your with a group of 4 or more, I recommend the fruit/cheese appetizer as it's way to much for 2 people but the selection and presentation is great. Also I know the mac and cheese is pretty highly recommended but it really wasn't my thing, and I generally love comfort food.   They have some great wines in their selection and the drinks like the sangria are usually pretty amazing. But like any place, it can be hit or miss depending on the bartender.  I like the patio, once again it's great for people watching as anyone who parks in the back has to walk through it to get to the restaurant. But calling it a patio is semi generous, as its actually just a back alley with couches, chairs and heaters thrown in it. Still, there is something endearing about it, especially in the spring/fall.  If you go and like it, check out Ticoz and Fez as well, as they are are all owned by the same people and you really can't go wrong with any of them.",

It was really good! Lime, strawberry, and orange flavors layered.....pretty great idea. My friend was a little disappointed because their beer list on their website is inaccurate and they don't have any beer on tap, but that's not that big of a deal. We shared the bruschetta and the dragon pita. The bruschetta came in two varieties, a classic tomato and basil and a less classic pimento pepper, artichoke spread, and cheese...both were very tasty. The pita had a really great sauce on it that had a sesame -y flavor and the mint on the sandwich added a fresh flavor to it, but I was a little disappointed because the menu stated it had avocado on it and ours did not. Not the worst thing in the world, but still not how I think it should be. Overall, I did like this place and I would definitely come back here again, especially for happy hour.",

I have been here before on a Saturday night, when it's extremely busy, and the service, hosts, bartenders, and food is GREAT. Today we came at about 115 so the restaurant was starting to slow down and there were plenty of open tables. We came in and we were expecting to be seated right away. However the host looked completely stressed out and didn't even greet us. He was rushing around the restaurant and even squeezed between myself and the host table to reach something and mumbled a sorry excuse me as he was walking away. He seated the group who was in line before us and made my group wait about another 15 minutes before he just looked at us and a group of two and said who's next?! And I said that would be us and he grabbed 3 menus and practically ran to the table, threw the menus down and said thanks and rushed off. I've always enjoyed coming to the restaurant and have even met the owner, who's very personable and very talented (we caught him on a night he was cooking), but the host kind of started our meal off with a bad vibe. Thank goodness we had a great waiter (I believe his name was Jeremy) and the food was great as always. I would have given 5 stars had it not been for the rude and unconcerned service of the host.",

Being suburbanites, we wanted to eat at a restaurant that was definately Central Phoenix.  No chains for us tonight.  This place is a great place.  Not too large, but offers a patio in the back, this Central Avenue restaurant is a short walk from the Encanto Boulevard light rail station.  One suggestion on Friday (or Saturday) night dining: make reservations.  My better half suggested this the day before and I'm glad he did.  There was a wait for people without reservations, but when we showed up, our table was waiting for us.  The server was very nice and attentive and the food was very good. The atmosphere was hip, slightly dark, but comfortable. We sat at a table for 2 near the bar and didn't feel overcrowded.  I highly suggest this restaurant if you have never been.",

We ended up trying to go with a healthier choice and unlike most places their salads and wraps were tops in my book. My girlfriend had some martini she loved and the lettuce wraps were really really good as well as the taco.  Here is some info:  Switch lettuce wraps - 5/5 first ones I loved but I am not an expert on the matter. roasted peppers and cheese were excellent additions. (update) they dont have these anymore, kind of sucks that they decided to change their menu. I can see this killing business as they removed a ton of good things like the pasta they had and switched over to menu items I think are going to be very unpopular like their meatloaf and pot pie. I wont change the rating since that salad is worth the trip but it sucks to see bad decisions being made at a place you really want to stick around.  Thai tacos - 5/5 I can't imagine someone could say it needed this or that, just right on the money.  Switch Salad - 5/5 if I could make salad like this I would eat it a ton more.  Sangria Salad - 4/5 my girlfriend had this and said it was great but I didn't try it.  Switch citrus drop martini - 5/5 my girl said she loved it.",

The restaurant has a cool vibe inside, kind of dark, but not too dark and the tables aren't too close together! On this day you could order off of the brunch or lunch menu, but we all ended up going for brunch.   My dad and sister got the eggs benedict....both are obsessed with this dish and get it everywhere we go....and they both LOVED it! I had the breakfast galette...don't you just love that word?....and it was amazing! Flaky pastry, sausage, cheese and eggs with some potatoes on the side...it made me really want to come back and check out the lunch versions! My mom had the crust less quiche with the mornay sauce and loved it as well....it was so huge she couldn't even finish it!   We all really enjoyed our meals, the service was excellent and we even got done early enough to check out some shops before the show!

I told the hostess there were empty seats all over and asked if we should go somewhere else. She told me very annoyed that we could sit at the bar. Through out whole meal nobody else sat at the bar. I wonder who was waiting.   Today i just returned for sunday brunch and was told there is a wait for a table, again plenty of seats open. So i said can i sit at the bar? She replied she was trying to keep those seats open \"incase a large party comes in.\" i asked ok where can i sit prior to being told \"just wait for a table.\" again i askes should i just go spend my money somewhere else? She then fumbled and said let me see what i can do. What can she do im thinking? What the hell there are open seats everywhere and nobody waiting and one of your best regulars wants ONE seat. Needless to say I walked right out.  In an economy where places are shutting down and losing their lease, id think you would hire nice and intelligent people. There are lots of over qualified people who need any job they can get. I dont know why i would spend my money somewhere where people are rude to me and incompetent.   You lose, switch.",

The atmosphere is great but is cheapened by a stereo system that sounds like a cheap all-treble boom box. Drinks are usually pretty good with only a few misses. Overall it's one of our go-to places to eat and have taken many visitors there.",

Thanks for letting me get that out of my system.Lunch today was delightful. Mom and I were downtown playing around and we tried Switch for something new.  Glad we did.    Our server Matthew was helpful, courteous and efficient. He really made the good food stand out .  For being at the peak of lunchtime it was nice to see the restaurant wasn't packed but they were well prepared for the lunchtime crowd.Food was served fast without feeling rushed. Drinks were filled promptly without hovering.  We had the Beef Galletta , a puff pastry with mushrooms, tender beef, brie , onions and a light sauce. Great size not too much but definitely filling.  Mom had chicken chop salad that looked fresh and tasty.  She really enjoyed it.   I look forward  to coming back and trying other items here.",

I do agree with some comments that it is a little dark in there, but otherwise, the atmosphere is nice and I've had good service.  I've had the lobster crepes, house salad, and the cookie dough desert.  The first time I had their specialty salad (and I had to pay extra to add chicken) it was fantastic, but the 2nd time, it just wasn't the same.  Something was off.  It seemed smaller and didn't have the right balance of all the different items that made it incredibly tasty.  The cookie dough never fails though!  My parents liked their meals when they were in town.",

We were given good service, good drinks, and good food.  The restaurant is beautiful and comfortable inside, and has a nice outdoor area as well.  The ambiance is a little trendy, but it was not a deterrent.  Their brunch specials are exceptional and we left quite happy.  I had the chef special, a slow cooked pork sandwich, very tasty.  My wife enjoyed the crepes juevos rancheros, which were delicious.  We also shared a carafe of screwdriver, which tasted like it had fresh squeezed OJ, thumbs up.  I have been there once before and have never been disappointed in the food or service.    Thank you Switch, we will be back.",

Both drinks were very refreshing and the bartender was very generous with the alcohol and spirits in each ;).

I had two glasses of white sangria that were just perfect.   My friend and I shared the cheese and fruit plate because it was on special. It was nice to try everything, and since it was on special it made everything taste better.  For my meal I had your traditional cheeseburger, and it was very good. I had half to take home which made for an excellent lunch the next day.   The only thing about the place that was a little strange was the crowd. I expected for having such an awesome happy hour it would be busier, however it was kind of dead. I even saw a group of people be seated and abruptly leave. It was kind of strange. Perhaps it was just an off night. This is definitely a place I would go to again!",

My friends ordered other brunch-y type foods, and the waffles were just OK, nothing special. I should give it another chance before making an opinion, but based on the menu, it just is OK.",

I spent $70 for 2 appetizers (crab puffs and cheese and fruit platter) and 2 burgers.  The crab puffs were horrible.  The pastry was too flaky with no taste and the imitation crab meat had a very strong taste, like cheap canned stuff.  I personally think the entire crab puff was something that was purchased frozen.  I used to order the cheese and fruit platter alot because I would get apples, figs, grapes, nuts, strawberries and about 5 types of cheeses.  Last night, the platter just had grapes, one strawberry and 4 pieces total of cheese. ( only 2 types of cheese). The burgers weren't very tasty either.  This was not worth $70.  My friend and I barely ate anything because the food was so disgusting.  I was also really upset about the lack of fruit and chesse for the platter.  I was disgusted and was ripped off.  I have patronized Switch many times over the years and they have now lost 2 loyal customers.  I will never go back.",

After rudely being told we'd have to wait for coffee because it was still brewing, he walked away as I asked what the breakfast special was. He definitely heard me. When he finally brought our coffees, he dropped the cream on the floor and it got all over my feet. I understand mistakes happen, but he did not apologize. Muttered \"shit\" and went to get a rag. He wiped up the floor but did not offer me any napkins for my feet. We then ordered food. We waited an hour for our food to come out. The table of 6 next to us, who ordered after us, was served before us. I'm pretty confidant he forgot to put our order in. The food was delicious & fantastic, up to Switch's standards. The service was not. I did speak to a manager who offered to take our coffees off the bill. Then I went home and had to wash my feet and sandals from the spilled cream. All could have been fixed with a simple apology & some napkins.  I previously loved everything about this place. I hope to go back and have a better experience like my previous ones.",

We added cheese to our scrambled eggs and they were perfect! I don't eat Pork so the server offered fresh fruit in place of the bacon or sausage which was also delicious.

I love the atmosphere.   Here's the kicker... the price.  I hadn't been in a while and oh my god have they jacked the prices.  The famed lobster mac 'n cheese is now over $20 after tax, which if memory serves me correctly is like $3-$4 more than I remember it ever costing me before.  While that doesn't sound like a lot for an entree... come on lets get real.. this is pasta and cheese, and little chunks of frozen shrimp and crab.  You don't have a lot of hard cost here.    Add onto that an appetizer, and a couple of drinks and you are talking about a $60 meal after you tip which is just crazy.  Since I never dine alone, you are easily talking $100 for two people which is ridiculous.     Are they trying to compete with Durant's?  lol   I don't know, but as it stands now their prices are going to keep me away.",

I had the black-n-blue berry Italian Soda off of their HH drink menu for $4! So refreshing! You'll find it garnished w/a fat blackberry on top of cocktail w/a nice blueberry layer resting at the bottom for a nice treat after you wet your whistle! Thumbs up here!  I tried their Hummus/Pita app and LOVED it! Great job!  Plus, my 2 coworkers were quite happy when I checked in on Yelp last night and scored us $10 off total bill of $50 or more. So, by dining here, I think I helped my career as well. Ha ha!",

Walk in and you will find a modern trendy ambiance, blue lighting, local abstract art and large IKEA mirrors. Lighting is a bit low but acceptable, it would make a great date spot.  The menu has salads, Panini, and some entre items for your mains. I went with the south west salmon $16.95 one of the pricier items on the menu.  It was pretty good, well-cooked nice flavors and a decent portion, it comes on a bed of slaw and salsa with a few fried zucchini sticks on top.   We also ordered a side of pesto risotto, it was fabulous, cheesy and full of basil and sundried tomato goodness.  For our other main we had the La Rojeta Panini, (the veggie goat cheese sandwich) 9.95. It was nothing special but I did appreciate the cerve` with every bite. It came with a small side Ceaser salad that was heavy on the cheese but a bit light on the quality of the romaine.  One little neat thing is the way you order and pay, the server has a i-pod touch which even has pictures of each dish, you even hold it to pay at the end, this way your card never leaves your sight.",

We all had high hopes for everything, and it's not like the food was terrible or something; in fact the Thai taco appetizer was excellent, and I enjoyed the risotto portion of the chicken risotto, but the prices are high, the beer selection was basically awful, and everything was overpriced. You can find higher or equal quality food elsewhere for less.   On the plus side, it shares a parking lot with Durant's, and that place smells really good when you walk by.",

Living in a near-by neighborhood we often frequent Switch for their location, quality of food and cocktails.  It was a Thursday night, the place was not crowed and plenty of seating for our group of 10.  After a little drama show from the greeter we were seated.  We were served water by the Manager and then forgotten.  More than 15 minutes had passed, after our initial water service and still invisible.  We eventually asked the manager if we were going to be served, she looked at as in disbelief and walked to the patio area.   After more than 20 minutes and still no server or manager to be found, we left.    We all walked to Durant's (next door),  spent our money there and had a much better experience and service.",

Some of my faves include: - mac & cheese: rich, creamy, flavorful cheese sauce over penne - caprese sandwich: typical ingredients with a great pesto vinaigrette   - burger: your basic burger, not too fancy, but great on taste Also, if you're looking to tie one on, they have some fantastic drink specials especially on Sundays where you can get carafes of mimosas, bloody marys, etc. for $3.",

To top it off we ordered the Red Velvet cake. The slice was massive and big enough to share with everyone at the table.   We sat outside on the \"patio furniture\"--  albeit a little tight it was as if we were at a bbq with friends. It was a nice change considering a long day of work inside.

Lot's of good flavors.  The menu says the meatloaf is made with beef and pork, but judging from the taste and the texture, I'd say it's made of mostly bread. Dry around the edges, not good. Sweet potato puree accompaniment was just overly-sweet mush.   Sandwiches at neighboring tables looked good.  I think the waiter may have been in training, but he needs a lot more training.  Several times he walked past our table without noticing that our glasses were empty or our checks and credit cards were hanging off the edge of the table waiting for him to run the cards.  When we finally managed to flag him down to refill our waters and iced teas, he took way all three glasses, filled them, and brought them back (the same glasses) and distributed them incorrectly.",

    "text": "When I was pregnant last year, I had the oddest cravings for chicken Caeser salads!  Like I wanted to eat one everyday, and I almost did, thanks to Switch and their delightful lunch waitstaff.  They definitely knew me by the end of the pregnancy and even remembered the baby's name after he was born (haha)!  There twist fries are huge.  If you get a side of fries, always order the aioli dipping sauce.  My husband is a big fan of the burgers and the sweet tea chicken.  My one complaint is that the drinks are kind of spendy...but if you get water, you don't have anything to worry about!  I've only been here for lunch, never dinner.  The lunch service is pretty fast overall, unless there's big groups.",

    "text": "Delightful environment. Excellent service. Totally hooked on the blueberry vodka cosmo. Loved my tea smoked bourbon glazed chicken but was sad that I had to skip the masa dumplings. Hence my only note to gluten-sensitive folks: my niece who made the reservation asked about gluten-free options on the phone and was told everything on the menu could be made gluten-free. This is totally not True. I didn't want a salad and that left only two items that could be served without gluten. I'm used to this challenge and it's not a big problem but please don't be misled by bad phone advice... btw my niece LOVED her goat cheese burger and awesome home fries. We shared the strawberry gelato even though we were very fully. Looking forward to a return visit next time I'm in town.",

We ordered an appetizer which was very good and ordered a salad and a pasta dish for the two of us. We mentioned we would share. When the food it came it was split in two portions which I thought was a nice touch. Little did I know when the bill came we were charged on both the salad and pasta a split charge. I noticed later the menu said there was a split charge. I didn't ask for it to be split and the restaurant wasn't busy. I get it if we had ordered one dish.  Customer service should have been the reason to take care of diners. To bad left a poor taste at the end of a nice dinner.",

I'm very particular about my mac n' cheese and this seemed meh. I know..how can someone screw up mac n' cheese? But you can and they did. Sorry - date, I ate most of it and it was pretty good but I could hardly taste the crab and lobster and if you are paying for it then I better see HUNKS of it and taste it.  The appetizer of New Zealand Lamb Loin was delicious and cooked perfectly as I hardly ever like lamb.  My sangria was delish and I would go back for some apps and the sangria - any day.",

    "text": "I finally went to Switch the other night and had an overall perfect experience.   Atmosphere: Clean simple with a little blue in the lighting.   Food: A great menu which everything looks good, so it's hard to decide what to get. You can practically point to something randomly and get something good.  Service:  Perfect and friendly, great gay wait staff which I think tends to be better at customer service in general.  Very friendly and fun, our waiter was warm and welcoming and very attentive. (don't know if the whole staff is gay, don't care, but the owners of the restaurant owns a few more in town and they are all great and tend to be gay staffed but I never had the gay bar feel or not welcome as a straight guy.)  Location: On central downtown Phoenix between Durant's and Schlotzsky's.  Price: Great for the quality of food. ($7-$14)  Room for improvements: Didn't get water by default, which I think all places in AZ should offer, although once we requested water, it was great tasting and kept filled.  Beer list is crappy, Bud, Miller, Coors, come on I know gays aren't beer pros but let's make a little more effort in that area.   My date says her Grey Goose and tonics were stiff like a good drink should be. I did find a few micro brews on the list, but not top choices.  What we ate: Lobster Crab Puffs, Great and the Chicken BBQ Feta sandwich, Exquisite. Greek side salads were the perfect size and creamy.  I will return anytime I can and highly recommend this place. I can't wait to work through the menu since it was hard to decide.",

I did take-out for a while, sticking to the Sangria salad and lobster crab puffs.  I finally decided to dine in again last night, taking two of my sisters with me to celebrate a birthday.  We were seated quickly by a gentleman who ended up being our server. He read our table pretty well, letting us talk and checking up every once in a while.  The food as always is amazing. My sisters were very satisfied with the Eastport Roll and the burchetta. I had the lobster & crab puffs, it's hard to say no especially with the sauce that goes with it.  Our server, Robert I believe, when mentioning dessert we asked if they had cheesecake. They had something better that I cannot remember what it was.  Robert made our night enjoyable and will definitely be going back soon.",

One of the things that this joint needs to work on is its service. We were there last night, and it was sort of a debacle when it came to the waiter here. We ordered onion rings as an appetizer. Appetizers, as a matter of tradition, need to come out before the main meal. As Eric Cartman so eloquently put it \"Well Starvin Marvin, these are appetizers. This is what you wat before you eat, appetizers make you more hungry. You don't need those!\"  And if Eric Cartman says it, its gospel truth!  So the appetizers came out with the main meal. This is poor form. Mind you this was a double down of poor form as it took them 30 minutes to get this out to us. The guy left carafes of water and tea (our drinks respectively) so he could avoid coming back to the table. It wasn't busy, it wasn't packed to the hilt, it wasn't slammed. Yet, he barely came to the table.  Then when we went to leave, it took him another 20 minutes to come out with the box and the check. This is pretty unacceptable, and it cost Switch a star.  Nothing to write home about here other than lack luster service and decent food. There are better choices nearby, but if you're without other plans this place does the trick in a pinch.  Overall, it gets a \"eh, ok\" from me.",

    "text": "This review is based on one visit for brunch, on Saturday, Sept 18th.   The space is really nice - a good-sized patio; a pretty cool, modern interior and a very clean bathroom (a huge sign, as any Kitchen Confidential fan is aware).   The service was eh. Our server did not seem very excited or even mildly enthused. She gave us the normal menu, then went outside to do... I'm not sure what. I had to go to the counter and ask if there was a breakfast menu. Our order was taken promptly, and our meals were ready rather quickly. Our water glasses were kept full. This was not a surprise, as we were the only two people in here at 10 am. People started to show as we finished, around 11 am or so.   So then food... ummm I'm pretty sure there was NOTHING low-fat about my meal. I went for the chef's special, which was:   - four smoky grilled shrimp (cooked just right, huge plus in my book) - white cheddar grits (cooked PERFECTLY, with a really creamy, cheesy flavor that did not overwhelm the rest of the dish) - andouille gravy (like a reddish roux, with chunks of the sausage, kind of heavy but very nice!) - and an over-easy egg topping the grits and gravy.   Oh... My... LORD.   I ate maybe half of this; it was so, so rich. The egg was so perfect, with its runny golden yolk adding even more richness to the grits and gravy. The shrimp seemed a bit out of place, but the smokiness of them went well with the sausage flavor.   This dish is my official brunch favorite, as long as I resist finishing the plate, and get a good retail meander in, afterwards.   My gal pal (haha, I know, how annoying to say) had the breakfast burrito. It looked pretty standard, but she said it was really good on flavor. She ate half of it, also finishing with an overfull belly.   Our bill (2 entrees, water), including tip, came to $21. Not bad, in my opinion.",

This is the first restaurant where I have found over 10 items on the menu I'd like to try.  We've been there 3 or 4 times now and I've tried something different every time (go me!).    *  The veggie burger had quite a bit of flavor and was well worth giving up the beef for the night. *  The mac and cheese is pretty good, sometimes cold, but that doesnt' stop me from ordering it each time we eat there.  *  The turkey and brie gallette was also good,  but gets a little rich towards the end. *  The jalisco sandwich is a fav!  A little messy but soooo worth it! *  Just recently I tried a bite of the baked lobster and crab puffs - will be ordering that one again! *  The bruschetta - there are two different kinds on the plate.  The first time we ordered this there was waaaay too much balsamic on the \"caprese\" but the ham & artichoke spread bruschetta was absolutely to die for, melt in your mouth, must have every time you go there good.  The second time we tried the bruschetta, both flavors were very good.  I've had bites of other things on the menu as well and I have no complaints.  The menu is extremely eclectic and it's worth multiple trips.",

I scheduled a work-related meeting at Switch for an early lunch (11 am - which is right when they open during the week). Parking was a breeze (although, I have SEEN the lot about an hour later, and it's not pretty).   I was planning on getting a salad because I had heard they have a great caprese-style salad, but I was wooed by the stuffed crepes. Rosted Mushroom Crepes, to be exact. Check it out: roasted thyme, mushrooms and onion with parmesan and bechamel. Hands down, I got the award for the most amazing plate at the table.   Seriously, my meal was hands-down fantastic. I cannot wait to go back to Switch.",

    "text": "I've been to Switch many many times so it is about time I give them a review!  I was in recently and once again experienced great service, prompt attention and tasty food and drinks.  I particularly enjoy their $4 carafes (only during weekends I believe) of mimosas and bloody mary's.  At any other restaurant, it is usually $4 for one drink, let alone an entire carafe.  I have ordered the Breakfast Mac n Cheese dish which is loaded with scrambled eggs, bacon, chives and of course mac & cheese.  It is delicious and very thick and  rich.  I am also a fan of the Chilaquiles breakfast dish, which I was hesitant to try at first because Switch isnt a Mexican food resturant and I was afraid it would not be up to par, but decided to go for it anyhow.  The dish was absolutley delicious and probably better than my own mothers home-made chilaquiles.  Also a must try is their green chile crepes.  The green chile sauce is spicy and the crepes delicately envelope cheese and their mix of spices is incredible.  Switch is a great place to try if you are in the downtown Phx area.  You will defintely find something you will like on their menu.  I believe they also have daily specials.",

I had a pork chop with apricot glaze that was very good. My womans pasta was great.  I can't explain why this place should not get at least 4 stars. The service was a little slow, but I could care less about that.  I will always take great food over service... but this place and the food and everything was just missing something.

And I wish the sangria wasn't so good and so strong so that I could actually come here and be able to drive myself home. All of the food is amazing. I've never had anything that wasn't and I've been here countless times. One of my favorites is the Very Berry Turkey sandwich. It is so good. And the portions are huge so I always have half to eat the next day. The red Sangria is also amazing, and again the serving size is incredibly generous.

Loved the atmosphere - trendy but not pretentious. Great selection of drinks, and the menu looked good, even though we didn't eat. So impressed that I convinced my friends we HAD to go back for Sunday brunch.  Sunday brunch was less than impressive. Food was eh. Atmosphere was eh. Drinks were ok.   But I really want to like this place! So I came back a third time. This time I was by myself, and I definitely don't recommend coming here solo. The bartender was too busy to talk/ask recommendations/take the time to take my order. There's one TV, but it only visible to a few seats.   And the cliental is all over the place. Not a good spot for a 20/30 something to make new friends or strike up a conversation.  I'd say the average age on my third visit (Thursday happy hour/dinner crowd) was 45ish. My 28 year-old self definitely brought down the average.   I'll probably try this place another time. Because I really do want to like it. Good parking, good location, good drink prices. It's just good.",

    "text": "I heard tons of positive reviews on this restaurant particularly their famous 'Switch burger' so I thought I'd give them a try.  Location & Aesthetics - Located in Phoenix and on my initial drive to the restaurant I sadly missed it even though the GPS said we had reached.  The facade of the restaurant looks unassuming and, in my opinion, the signage could've been a little better.   When I turned around, I didn't miss it the second time.  Apparently parking is in the rear and you can also choose to enter in the rear or in the front.  To me it was easier to enter in the rear as I parked there. Lots of parking when we arrived which was around 1630-1700 for dinner.  Our initial thoughts was we were going to be the only ones there as the parking lot was empty.  My advice, if you're going for dinner, get there early because as we were leaving, the parking lot was full with no spots left.  In fact, when we pulled out, another potential customer took our spot immediately. The restaurant itself is snazzy, chic, superbly clean, uncluttered, lots of space between tables/chairs, and well decorated.  One can chose to sit outside with what looked like comfortable chairs and tables, and even fans attached to the wall to keep folks cool.  We chose to sit inside where the A/C was on but wasn't blasting, just comfortable enough.  Menu - Well laid out, self-explanatory, and wasn't overwhelmingly 2-5 pages/leafs long.  Service - The staff was really nice, friendly, warm, welcoming, and accommodating.  Any questions (about the menu) were answered promptly.  Our waitress checked on us several times throughout the meal to ask if everything was good, asked about drinks/refills, and asked about our appetizers.    Food - For my drink, I ordered the sweet tea vodka lemonade which was positively addicting!  I wanted more but since I was the designated driver, one was where I drew the line. For appetizers we ordered the onion rings.  Initially we were told it was just going to be around 8 but instead was greeted with much more plus given 2 dips - ketchup and another whose name eludes me now.  The onion rings was hot, fresh, crunchy and very tasty with not too much batter surrounding the onion itself (not overly fried). For the main course, I ordered the 'Switch House Burger' which was out of this world.  The beef was well seasoned and cooked to perfection, mouth watering, and juicy, and cooked exactly how I asked -- medium-to-well done.  Many of the ingredients it contained balanced each other out, e.g., the tartness from the goat cheese was balanced by the Switch fig dressing; and the zesty taste of the Arugula was balanced out by the onion strings....everything was perfect!  The only reason they lost a star was because toward the end of the meal, we felt rushed as the waitress asked if we wanted to order any dessert, we declined, and immediately presented with us with the check.  Not a big deal in my book but the gesture was noticed by another in my party.  This place really some nice looking tasting items on their menu and, for me, it's definitely worth coming back to try some of them.",

    "text": "So I am a part of a June 2012 mommies group online.  There's a few of us that are located in Phoenix and we decided to all meet up for the first time and do a Mom's Night Out this past Friday evening.  Our original plan was to meet at Fuego, but instead we switched it to Switch.    We have a 7:30 reservation for 5 of us.  One of the mom's had something come up with her LO, so it ended up being just 4 of us.  We all arrived within minutes of each other - last one arriving at about 7:40 or so.  We're greeted and asked for our drink order - easy peasy.  That's where the decent customer service ended and turned into at best, mediocre.  Our drinks arrive and we're still looking over the menu (and chit chatting at the same time).  Our server, Angel (according to the Associate name on my receipt), came back a few times to take our dinner order...but we were still deciding on what we were going to get.  He tried to make recommendations to one of the gals, who is a picky eater, and we thought..okay..we'll get to order.  He left and didn't return to our table for at least 30 minutes.  He finally comes back and it had been so long that we had forgotten we hadn't ordered yet.    We order and our food arrives (3 of us order salads, and the other ordered a sandwich) about 15 minutes later - Time is now going on 9:00pm.  Our server disappears again for at least another 45 minutes.  He finally comes back and asks us if we want boxes.  We say no, and you'd think he'd already have the check ready.  Think again.  The time stamp on my bill states 10:07 pm.  The only good thing he did was he split the check for us based on Guests.    I had a Yelp Check-In offer, $10 off a bill of $50 or more.  Our bill after taxes was over $60.  We decided to not use the Check-In offer because we didn't want to confuse our server and end up waiting around for another 30-45 minutes.  We had tables around us come and go, but yet there we were still sitting and waiting.      We were there in total about 2 hours and 40 minutes - all for 3 salads, a sandwich, 2 glasses of wine, and an iced tea.    Friday Night Mommy Fellowship - Fantastic!  Food - Average.  Our Server Angel - Terrible!",

(Story: Sunday night, every place in closed - literally, our three bookmarked Yelp spots in downtown.  What's up with that, PHX?  Luckily, Yelp pointed us to Switch off the beaten path north of downtown.)  Always get a seat at the back patio.  And don't be a pansy by asking to turn on the heat lamps - get an extra drink instead.  It's only Arizona \"cold.\"  - $6 Red Sangria - Served in a tall highball glass.  The fruit blend was unique with apples, strawberries, and blueberries.  And of course, who doesn't love sangria?   (The abundant other cocktails were dirt cheap at $6-$9!)  - $12 Lobster and Seafood Crepe (3) - I didn't taste much of the crab and shrimp, but there was a lot of lobster.  Paired with the bechamel sauce, the crepes were a delicious, lighter fare.  The accompanying, seasonal long baby asparagus were fresh and tender.  - $11 Thai Braised Beef Tacos (4) - So much flavor in the tacos from the marinated beef and the sauce, although a bit drippy.  Five stars, and the extra sixth star is for subtly advertising on the drink menu that there are $4 Screwdriver & Bloody Mary carafes and $6 Mimosa carafes for weekend brunch.  Consider it a Yelp tip for when I come back.  Well played, sir.",

From start to finish our server was extremely patient and accommodating with 6 VERY undecided gals. The food was spectacular, we each ordered something different and even ordered their shrimp appetizer special twice! Make sure to order the cornbread pudding, it needs to be a side for everything! We never felt rushed and everyone seemed happy to be there. The service and hospitality definitely Wowed not only me but all the guests including the Birthday Girl. Thank you so much for making the evening a pleasant and delicious experience!",

That's why I came back for my 20th birthday dinner here with a group of 15 friends.   Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. Had something simple like chicken fingers as an appetizer, shared the steak special (honestly I've had better elsewhere) but I won't complain it is what it is. Had the birthday dessert Pazookie and loved it as well as everyone else who took a bite! Only other thing I might add is that it was really hot inside. We told our waiter about it and he kindly told us that he agreed and alerted the manager. Also, they give a discount when you check in on yelp, which was pretty cool too.  I recommend Switch :)",

Food quality: the food were fantastic. The portion size was definitely larger than my expectation. For a person who eats a lot, it filled me up very well. Normal sized eater would likely have leftovers. With the quality of the food being amazing, it definitely makes you happy.   Price: The price of this restaurant is definitely on the higher end. Each entree is about $17+. But given the portion size, it's quite worth it. If you're worried about the cost, I recommend sharing a dish as the portion size would cover both of your stomach.   Overall: I'd definitely recommend this place to my friends and others. Give it a try and you won't regret it.",

    "text": "Had the chance to stop in to Switch recently. This is a very nice, laid-back establishment with an open feel. There's an intimate and cozy patio area in the back that looks to be a great spot to spend time. The menu consists of what might look to be, at first glance, a mixture of \"bar food\" type fare on a slightly upscale level consisting of items such as burgers, pretzel bites and fried chicken bites. But also to be found are Creole Shrimp & Grits, Prime Pub Steak, and Roasted Pork Pappardelle, to name a few. I opted for the Classic Burger and let me say, this is not just typical \"bar food\"; nicely presented with a choice of sides ( in my case the Twisted Fries which included sides of ketchup, a nice mustard sauce concoction and a mild but tangy white sauce for dipping ).  The drink menu is nicely varied with a decent selection of wines. There are also a number of hand crafted cocktails to choose from. I decided on the \"Green Crush Margarita\", which was pretty damed tasty. A good selection of craft beers is also there for your enjoyment.  Seating is spacious and includes a long high table for large groups as well as numerous booths. The bar is a great place to hang out as well (that's where I posted up).  Overall I don't think you'd go wrong spending some time at Switch. I know I'll be back. Check it out.",

We had the crispy brie cheese wedge and flying pig appetizers. Both were unique and very tasty. The crispy brie cheese wedge had a panko breading with habanero honey,  berries, and crusty bread slices. The habanero was not overly hot. The favorite was the flying pig. That was mini pork wings with an apricott BBQ sauce, feta cheese, peanuts and celantro.  Everyone in our 5 person party had something different and all had rave reviews. I had the yard bird chicken sandwich with the apricott BBQ sauce, feta cheese, spinich, red onion served on a ciabatta roll with a large side salad. Took half of it home for another meal.  This one is a keeper for midown Phoenix. Prices were moderate but very reasonable given the quality of food and portion size. A well deserved 5 STARS!",

The sandwhich and fries were pretty good.   Inside you'll find a contemporary grayscale interior with pops of bright colors. I like the monochromatic feel, but others might not.  You can park in the shared lot 2601 on Central, Switch, and Durant's share.   They have a real lunch rush here so don't expect a quick lunch, they get pretty packed.",

Switch is essentially a perfect work lunch spot. It's big a vibrant but not so much that you can't have a conversation, and while it gets busy during that lunch hour the service is great. Star.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  My very large portion of Roasted Pork Pappardelle came to $17.00, which wasn't unreasonable given the portion size. Star.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  This pasta dish was just okay. The wide noodle pasta itself was fine although didn't taste handmade, and while the pork and peripherals were flavorful the meat and the pasta just really didn't go particularly well together. The dish needed some sort of sauce to bring it all together. Single Star.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Switch Restaurant is a-okay, but I'm not dying to go back anytime soon given the breadth of great spots in the area. No Star.",

Messy but awesome mix of flavors. The super chop salad has a good variety of veggies and a delicious dressing. You have several protein options and 2 sizes are available for salads. Service was top notch. I used my yelp check in coupon and there were no issues. They were happy to apply the discount. Drinks here are great. I didn't expect much from a mule but it was watermelon based and spicy! So good. Porch swing tea based drink is great for a hot day. Will definitely be back to try more!!",

The dump truck sammich had lots if ingredients but the flavors individually were not too spectacular (e.g. the fried chicken tasted only slightly salted, couldn't taste the maple, the onion jam was good). I got street corn as my side and my first bite with cheese was flavorful but the rest of the corn didn't have enough sauce. Others in my party got the spicy pork pasta, BBQ burger, clams in wine sauce, the tacos (heard they were really good), and the other sammiches. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. Overall good experience though!",

My experiences, however, are limited to their brunch menu. The 3 Egg Breakfast, the Huevos Rancheros, and the Switch Benedict, have all been major successes.   But let's be honest, Switch's brunch special of all cocktail carafes being 50% is the main reason for this 5-star review! It's always cool when you get alcohol half off, but it's how tasty and refreshing they were that really made the difference. I've tried the mimosa and red sangria one, and the red sangria takes the cake! It has fresh fruit in it, and the perfect balance of \"juiciness\" and a \"lit time\".   Oh, the service has been flawless as well, obviously.",

I really love the food, but the staff needs to take better care of the customer.  Rudeness and condescension are not really important to make me think the food is fabulous, it just makes me think the staff is full of jackasses.  I have had some truly phenomenal wait staff, so this is a \"not all the time\" thing, but it should never really happen at all.

The sauce is to die for-first they were flat grilled skewers-awesome. Then they rolled them up into a Popsicle looking piece of grilled chicken-OK, a little odd but still tasty. THEN...they breaded the chicken. Ewww. The best BBQ sauce on the planet can't save these things. I asked my server why tamper with perfection, and he said that most customers like it better.  Ah well-won't keep me from going there ever again. Maybe just less often.   Sell the Apricot BBQ sauce-you could make a fortune!",

So many guilty pleasures here. The mac 'n cheese with lobster is a favorite, as is the Amsterdam pasta. The salads and huge list of sandwiches are likewise comforting on hot days. The galettes aren't usually special, but I'll still order them when the mood strikes.  The service is way above average, though sometimes the patio can feel like Siberia. But because this is a place where you'll want to relax all evening, that's okay.   Always ask about their recession special. Five dollars (I think) gets you a sandwich and salad. It can be hit-or miss, so I usually have a friend order something else and we split our plates.",

Fantastic drink specials (though not too high-priced outside of HH either).  Burgers are ALWAYS cooked to perfection- and I like 'em bloody not burnt; so I know my meat.  And the mac'n'cheese- forget about it... or rather- Don't.  Perfect blend of cheeses and perfectly cooked noodles makes you dread having to wait for it too cool down before shoving in your gullet. Staff are always slammed- but attentive despite the rush.  Went here for New Years a couple years back and you better have that \"Ball Dropper\"- helluva drink and again- at a great cost.  I'll be going back for years to come I'm sure. See you there!",

    "text": "This is a tough one for me.  I've been to Switch several times and I'm really pretty torn.  I've experienced some pretty terrible service (both times on the patio) and I've only really loved one item on the menu.  I tried the Spartan Pita the first time I was there, and the last time I was there I got the pesto chicken sandwich.  Both were pretty average, especially for the price.  I recently took the boy here and he ordered a burger- he said it wasn't anything special.  Lately I've been having some beef envy (as I am very close to the one year no beef mark) and I had zero desire to take a bit out of this piece of cow.    I'm a huge fan of their seafood crepe because it is delicious.  I also am a fan of $1.99 brunch beverages.  I'm just a bit weary of heading over here on a groggy Sunday morning when I need things like water constantly.  I live way too close to not come back here often, and I'm hoping that other menu items and slightly more consistent service will make me feel less torn about Switch.",

They do allow smoking, so be fore-warned about that. The only way we could tell our server was a newbie was that he had a pal shadowing him around and taking care that he was doing all he could to make our meal memorable. And it was! Our brunch - quiche of the day - was ridiculously delicious. I imagine they are all different, but this chicken, asparagus, chipotle, mushroom, spinach, and corn creation was amazingly flavorful. Mimosas were made from the freshest orange juice I have tasted in quite awhile. Two of us ordered the quiche and one of us ordered the breakfast special with beautifully poached eggs, crunchy baguettes, and a heaping pile of prosciutto. Great service, lovely ambience, good cocktails, and the food - wow, oh wow! Can't wait to visit again.",

    "text": "My husband heard good reviews from a business associate so we decided to  try Switch's Brunch.  My first impression of the actual restaurant was \"bar like\", basically dark walls and ceiling.  This always makes me feel like I am in a man cave sports bar, which is fine for evening, but for brunch? Not so much.  General decor was good.  The hostess was very pleasant and fortunately seated us near a window.  Our waiter was prompt and very nice.  It took us some time to browse the breakfast and lunch/dinner menus. Many items were intriguing and unusual, maybe even gimmicky, i.e. Eggs Benedict with provolone cheese .  I will say that I do have a problem with restaurants that have too many dishes on their menu.  It has been my experience that no dish is really done well.    My husband decided to have the Amsterdam Pasta with grilled chicken and I decided to try the Eggs Benedict (without the provolone).  Both dishes were highly recommended by our waiter.    First, I will say that my husband's pasta was good.  I thought the flavors were nice and pasta was cooked well.  Grilled, unseasoned, sliced chicken breast was the cliche'd bar style addition to the entree.  Overall, my husband would give it a 3.     Now, the Eggs Benedict, sigh, I will first premise my review on the fact that I am a huge fan of this dish and when it is done well, it is heavenly.  Unfortunately, I was not a big fan of Switch's Benedict.  First, one of my pet peeves with some restaurants is that they lack the understanding that a truly great Eggs Benedict must have a well made hollandaise.  The sauce must also be made from scratch: eggs yolks, melted butter and lemon juice (basic).  It can be made in a blender in under a few minutes!  Unfortunately many chain restaurants and hotels use pre-made sauce or powder base that is really vile.  I did ask the waiter when I ordered if the Hollandaise was made from scratch.  He answered, \"Yes\".   Unfortunately the moment the plate was placed in front of me, I knew my worst fear was realized!  \"IMPOSTER\"!!!!!!  The sauce was some weird concoction (an odd sweetness too), the eggs were undercooked (whites a little runny) and the English muffin was NOT toasted.  I did not complain.  I ate one egg and left the other.  I give this dish 1 star.   Overall, we had a pleasant experience (good staff and of course good company with the hubby) with mediocre food.    Not sure if I will selectively come back but if my husband and I are in the area....",

The service is meh.  The servers always seem like they have something better going on.  Once we ordered French press coffee and the server made fun of us because we didn't know what it was.

Inside, there are more loveseats and pillows, navy decor and dark tables, adding an instant air of intimacy, warmth, and relaxation to the place.  I was having a business lunch on a Friday afternoon.  It wasn't super-busy, and we were seated at a nice table near the street indoors.    I was impressed with the good variety in the menu, from salads to burgers, pasta, seafood and more.  I came across a different kind of listing: crepes, and decided to try their seafood one.   Two crepes came with lobster, scallops, some chopped tomatoes, white sauce, and I believe chives, along with green beans on the side.  It was very tasty, the crepes were great, and the fish tasted good.  Coming from the Northeast, I know good fish!  Service was fast, friendly, and efficient.  I definitely will go back here!",

I was still pretty inexperienced with drinks of the alcoholic persuasion, and our waiter really took the time to help me decide on a beverage. We both ordered the sangria (trying sangria from different restaurants has since turned into a little bit of a hobby), and it was delicious. They use plenty of different types of fruit and put a lot of it in the drink which is a rarity.   The food followed the drinks in both quality and taste. The Pesto Chicken was very flavorful, and the Caesar Salad also tasted great. I want to try the Mac and Cheese next time I eat here; I saw someone else order it, and I was very impressed.

    "text": "After the long drive to Phoenix from Cerritos, the hubby and I were starving. After we got settled in our hotel room, I hopped on Yelp looking for something GOOD to eat. Switch popped up near the top and after reading all of the positive reviews, we headed out.   From the outside, the place looks really unassuming...almost DEAD even. But once inside I was pleasantly surprised. The decor is HOT! I love the section of leather couches all along one side of the partition and the sofa seating outside on the patio. Since those areas looked like they were for groups of people, we opted for a table.   We were shocked because the place wasn't DEAD inside, but it wasn't what we were expecting as far as crowds are concerned. I guess living in L.A., we've become jaded towards the Happy Hour crowds we're accustomed to. Our server was REALLY nice and offered the specials for the day (which sounded amazing). Instead I opted for the HIGHLY raved about Lobster & Crab Macaroni & Cheese and my husband got a sandwich.   I don't even know where to begin. The food was AMAZING!! It was almost a sin for anything to taste soooo good. Never mind that I'm shell fish and lactose intolerant! Sometimes you just gotta bite the bullet, yanno? It seemed the more I ate, the more there was STILL to eat! We got there with 15 minutes left for Happy Hour specials, so I ordered a $3 Hurricane and WOW...that thing was STRONG! I totally got my $3 worth! I couldn't even finish it (LAME, I know...I know...)  This is just the kind of trendy place I'd take my girlfriends to for Ladies Night!",

I don't like grits... these were GONE. The veggies were asparagus and baby carrots, cooked perfectly. The chops were done to perfection, which is rare.

The food is always consistently good, I've tried probably half the menu and have yet to experience something that wasn't enjoyable. I think what really prompted me to write this review (though it's been a long time coming) is that I was working late one night when I saw that the chef had posted a description of that night's special on Facebook. They do it all the time (I assume daily) but this dish really caught my eye. It was an Asian inspired dish which is a bit different than usual. It had chicken meatballs, noodles, veggies and a sweet and spicy broth. I called to order it for take-out and the person on the phone taking my order told me she would have to check if that dish was available for take out since it was soup. She puts me on hold and a minute or two later and Chef Jason himself gets on the phone with me to tell me how he is going to package the dish (noodles/veggies/meatballs in one container and broth in another container) and explains he's doing it that way to keep it from getting soggy and making a mess on the drive home. He even told me how to prepare it when I got home. I loved that he took that extra minute and gave me personal attention that I didn't request or even know I needed. It was that extra care and attention that really set Switch apart from it's competitors.",

I usually get the turkey sandwich with cranberries on it (the official name escapes my memory).   I can't say much about their Happy Hour or drinks in general, because I have not been since I turned 21. However, I will have to make a stop in soon so that I can check that out.   I love their servers. Being a waitress myself, it is really easy for me to spot servers that are \"fake\", and the servers at Switch all seem to be genuinely nice people who enjoy their jobs.",

When we go back we will definitely ask for him. The lobster crab puffs are an absolute must for an appetizer. Very reasonably priced menu with a unique wine selection. As a self proclaimed wine-o I really enjoy it when I go to a restaurant and don't recognize any of the names on the menu. Ambience is very modern yet relaxed. Nice patio for when it finally begins to cool down here :) I seriously have nothing negative to say about Switch. 2 thumbs up. And ask to be seated in Tim's section :)",

Wraps and sandwiches range from decadent to healthy (personal faves are the Apricot BBQ Feta Chicken and Dragon Chicken Pita) and entree salad portions are extremely generous (try the Sangria or Super Chop). Burgers look decent, although I have not personally tried one. Great drink menu: I've never had to send back a watered-down Manhattan here.

    "text": "This was simply terrible. I'm not sure why the reviews are so good, anyone with an elementary level palette could tell the food is not up to par. My drink came not as described so I sent it back asking for the sweet and sour mix to be left out. It returned the exact same way and the waitress said \"The bartender made it more sour\". I needed to explain my simple request again that I would like the drink made exactly as described on the menu; they got it right the third time. The crispy Brie looked amazing on the menu, but when it came out it was just a piece of Brie thrown in the deep fryer, rind and all. I asked the sever if the crab was frozen or canned and she couldn't give me a definitive answer so I did not order the crab puffs. At this point I was rethinking my lobster mac n cheese entree choice and just decided to snack on my husband's food and order a side of the \"Gourmet mac n cheese\". I'm glad I didn't make the mistake of ordering my own entree. The pasta was soggy and the sauce obviously contained Velveeta, it was disgusting and left uneaten. The highlight of the evening was me giving up on the food and going for a dessert martini. I didn't feel confident in server's ability to remember the ingredients, despite her urging me to just tell while holding our dirty dishes so I ended up ordering it at the bar. The bartender made it perfectly and I sipped on that magic until we left, although our server was irritated by this and told us someone else was taking over our table. All in all, if you are expecting delicious food and a quaint cute place, save yourself the disappointment of dining here.",

    "text": "The Good...food was above average, slightly above average but above average.  The Lettuce Wraps were tasty and the Chicken Risotto was good (very rich).  Not special but good.  Based upon all the great reviews, I was expecting amazing, alas it was not the case.  The Bad...service was awful.  My normal rule of thumb is that if no one has come to the table within 5 minutes of sitting down I get up and leave...it went well beyond that time this time because I was with a business associate and didn't want to make them uncomfortable.  Here is a tip for those that are behind the bar.  If someone comes up and nicely asks if they know whether they have a waiter or waitress or not, it probably means they have been sitting at a table for a while and no one has been over to see them.  DON'T respond, \"I don't know, you've got to talk to the Host\" and turn away back to your conversation with the other bartender.  DO say \"I don't know, let me see if I can find out\".  Once we did get a server, he continually forgot that we were there, drinks went empty and we had to wave at him to get his attention.  As far as being called a \"Wine bar\", having a selection that includes one type of each of the normal types of wine (8 in all) does not classify an establishment as a \"Wine Bar\".  This is definitely a misnomer.  The Ugly...there are better places in the Phoenix area to eat that have much better service. It may have just been and off night I may or may not give this one another chance based upon all of the other stellar reviews for the restaurant.  However, my review at this point is to avoid unless you don't mind bad service.",

The only time you realize that you are in fact in Phoenix is when the bill comes and you realize that you and a friend ate appetizers, salad, entrees and coffee for the price of one drink in any of the other previous mentioned cities.    We happned upon this restaurant on the recommendation of the hotel receptionist.  basically our only criteria was someplace close...as we had to drive a few hours to Globe Arizona that night.  (now if you are wondering, hmm, globe where is that...its the middle of nowhere and no you haven't heard of it)...Our hotel lady said the name is \"switch like a lightbulb\" after going though I believe \"Switch\" may have another meaning...we are glad she mentioned it as its unlikely we would have found it ourselves, its so small and dark from the outside.    Anyway, there are many small plates, to which we had three.  (too much)  The rissotto balls were outstanding.  the chicken appetizers were ok, good but nothing fancy.  I ordered a cucumber salad as well.  And the chicken came with a side cucumber salad thing which I thought was the salad but another much bigger one came a few minutes later.  The ceaser salad looked good and I think was like 2.75...no really, you read that right.  The entrees were yummy, a au jus type of sandwhich and I got some pasta special....all very good.   And the best part, if I checked in I got 10 dollars off.  All of this food, plus coffee came to 42.00.    The drink menu looked yummy, full of fancy cocktails, but we couldn't partake...as we had to drive to Globe Arizona...but we ordered two coffees to keep us awake...because the ride is boring to globe...only weird thing, no to go coffee cups, wtf?  The patio looked very cute but I think its for smokers... All in all, i'd be back to switch. Id even be back if it was located in San Francisco...",

This comes with 6 decent sized shrimp, with a slice of avocado on each one, as well as condiments.  To drink, I ordered a ginger iced tea, which was Republic Tea in a bottle.  Love that stuff!

Some interesting European inspired choices, too.  We had sandwiches the night we were there, and they were stellar. Amazing hummus on the side.   Our server was great.

A huge thanks to Jason and his staff for helping to make our party such a success.  The ambiance, food and service were absolutely wonderful - each of our 50 guests loved SWITCH (so much so that one of my dad's colleagues already booked the space for a private event, having never been there prior to our party)!  The coordination for our event was so easy and seamless leading up to the day itself, too.  Jason helped me put together a menu that allowed our guests to pick from among 5 options (one of which is not on the regular menu but was easily added because it's my dad's fave breakfast food) and all you can drink bloody marys, mimosas, coffees, juices and soft drinks.     Our menu consisted of: Croissant Sandwich with egg, bacon, smoked Gouda and Aioli Egg Burrito with jack cheese and potatoes Mornay covered Crustless Quiche with smoked turkey, green onions, spinach, and mushrooms. Candied Pecan Pancake Stack Sourdough French Toast Stickies with bacon or sausage  The portions were huge and all of the dishes received rave reviews!!  Jason also printed personalized menus for all of our guests which were featured at each place setting.  The staff were attentive and accommodating and the space is so beautiful that we really didn't need decorations.  If you are looking for the perfect venue for a private party, I recommend SWITCH 100%!",

I'm all for presentation, so when the server brought us share plates, and my plate had food crusted on it, I was sad.  Yet when he took the plate to the bar and wiped off the crud with a bar towel, I was disgusted!  I knew that he intended on returning said plate to me...and he did.  If I hadn't witnessed the act, none-the-wiser, right?  The food was basic...nothing to write home about.  We tried the: 1.  bbq apricot chicken sandwich -  tasty 2.  macaroni and cheese - sub-par 3.  chop-chop salad - not worth ordering 4.  fries - thicker cut with seasoning - worth ordering    The service was okay, the food was satisfactory, and the trip was not worth the gas.",

    "text": "After visiting this place so many times, I got tired of it for a couple of reasons.  First one was that I would take vendors here, or coworkers from work and after the meal they always made some comments about the waiters and waitresses. Seeing waiters with their bare chest hanging out, fishnet tops and such were just a little too out there for some. I started to get questions from vendors/coworkers if they were going to get hit on or rubbed up against or if lapdances were going to be involved. Then they started questioning my sexuality! So a long break was needed.  I am pleased to say the last two times I have been there for lunch its actually gotten a lot better. Its definately been toned down a lot which I am happy so I can get my free meals out my vendors again here =) Although some wont go back there just because of their own insecurities and fears I think.  Still love their food, and think its some of the best in town. Have yet to go for dinner...",

They were very generous with the appetizers for about 12 people and the service was excellent.  Maybe it was the holiday spirit, but the mood just seemed great for a chill and relaxed evening with my hubby's coworkers.  No one even ordered alcohol, which was probably good because we would have been there all night.  The few other times I have been to Switch was with alcohol and their mixed drinks are really good.  There was a pomegranate and vodka drink that I recall being very original and tasty.  I think one of  their happy hours it's two for one, so ended up having at least two of the same thing.  And any place that can serve lobster mac and cheese for about 10 bucks is always worth going to.",

    "text": "I hadn't been to Switch in years and years, but it's still a reliable and good quality spot in Central Phx, and great location by the light rail and Heard Museum.  The menu manages to be varied and interesting despite having mostly sandwiches and burgers. And God bless em for having pretzel buns. Man, I miss those!  We had spotty service on most recent visit. They had taken the veggie burger off the menu but assured the vegetarian that a veggie patty could replace the meat in any burger. So a burger - with veggie patty - was ordered. And it arrived, with the veggie patty but also with bacon.   The server huffed about taking it back, made n unnecessary  comment along the lines of \"Oh, you didn't want bacon? It says it comes with bacon on the menu.\" True enough but due to your lack of veggie burger option on the menu, the ordering system is sort of flawed.  I am of the position that, as a server who knows the menu inside and out, it would have been helpful to point out to someone ordering a vegetarian version of something on your menu (in the way she was instructed to do it) that their burger choice also comes with bacon and ask if they in fact want the bacon or not. Do I expect too much? Maybe?  In any case, the rest of the food was great, portions big and prices on par for what you get.   I'm still a fan, and I'm glad to see Switch is still going strong in the Central Corridor, as I recall that it was a struggle to get Phoenicians to go out and about in the area back when it opened. It was bustling for a weekday lunch and sounds like it's a popular spot for good quality happy hour cocktails :)",

When ordering, I made a point of asking about the potatoes. Were they potatoes or potatoes with onions and whatnot. The nice server let me know they were potatoes topped with onions and peppers, but could be served without. When served, the potatoes were correct, but the eggs were heavily coated with onions peppers. The smell and taste of raw green onions were infused in the meal. I couldn't eat it. I probably should have sent it back, but didn't want to be 'that guy'. Most surprising were the server who never seemed to notice my uneaten meal and the manager who cleared plates made no comment about the full plate, simply piling another plate atop my eggs Benedict. So, if you have specific food issues, make certain you ask for them to be applied to all elements on the plate. Switch can't be expected to think that far for their customers.",

Unfortunately, I'm not able to drink alcohol right now, but the carafe specials they have going on at brunch are pretty awesome. I'm more of a mimosa guy, and most of my friends are the same or go the bloody Mary route, but I think it's unique (re: AWESOME) that Switch also offer carafe's of Cape Cods & screwdrivers.   As far a food goes, my french toast was yummy. I LOVED the blueberry/fig syrup on top. It was sweet, but not too sweet. I appreciated the fact it came w/a couple of sausage links, but honestly, they were a little overcooked and almost seemed like an afterthought just thrown on the plate. They were decent enough though and were a good balance w/the sweet french toast.   Our service was very good & I really liked the atmosphere. I also appreciate the fact that Switch has a parking lot. I know that Phoenix isn't a NY or San Francisco (I lived their for 5 yrs), but it has become more & more of a metered/garage city so it's nice to have a free lot to park at when you want to dine downtown.   The lunch/dinner menu looked really good (and like the brunch menu, pretty affordable), so I'll definitely be back to try some of that stuff!",

    "text": "I've heard nothing but great things about this place but in my humble opinion, it was just okay.  It probably would've been better if we weren't a party of 12.  I had the garlic and lemon hummus to start and that was delicious. I loved the tasty garlic spread over the bite sized slices of pita. I ordered the salmon fresca thinking it would be just as good. Unfortunately, the food took what seemed like an eternity (at least 30+ minutes) before it was brought out.  They waited too long to serve our meal. I saw our dishes sitting on the counter for a while. We weren't served until all the dishes were prepared and because we were such a large group, that wait was loooong. The food was cold by the time I took my first bite and I wasn't the only one complaining. *sigh*  The parmesan crusted salmon was flavorful but it should've been soft and warm at the very least. The bed of polenta that the salmon was served on ended up being spongy and dough like. Not the most appetizing. The portions were on the larger size but what's the point when the food was just...blah.  The service was decent though. I ordered an Arnold Palmer and it was refilled a few times without even asking.   The atmosphere is very welcoming and the menu looks delicious. I'd definitely come back here again for dinner or lunch to try something else, but for now it's A-OK.",

Went here on a Tuesday night because we'd gone to Postino the night before for their awesome Monday/Tuesday night deal ($20 for bottle of wine and bruschetta platter) and didn't want to go two nights in a row. That was probably a mistake. I'm fairly certain the mac & cheese is made with velveeta, and the pork sandwich was dry and rubbery. The side of green beens was undercooked and had little flavor. Everything was just...meh. We did have good wine but it was all very underwhelming and sad.",

    "text": "Ok this is my second review and it will be quick, Cool looking hip spot on Central that I must have passed a million times  without ever seeing.   I met my  darling Salina there for lunch there at her request and was in and out quickly.  I had a deeeeeelisous cup of some crazy roasted tomato gazpacho with a rockin cucumber  ( I think, I wasn't paying attention) sorbet on top. This was utterly fantastic... sweet, slightly tart  and crunchy tiny bits of cold crisp vegetable heaven swirling in a slightly soupy tomato based broth that was seasoned perfectly, ( though I could have added a few drops of  some heat from any source.. but this is a personal preference and being a former chef I know that  you have to sometimes cook for the most common denominator...)  The Sangria salad was  also really good. The thing about these 2 dishes thats most important to note, while not necessarily groundbreaking, this food was \"clean\".   This is my chefs speak for food that is expertly prepared.. because anyone who knows good food knows that technique is one of the most critical components of execution of any dish... you can have all the fresh and best ingredients in the world, but if you cant, prep, poach, roast, slice, dice, cook and time ( I could go on for hours but wont)   your ingredients perfectly in the smallest, seemingly insignificant detail, to create the end result of what you want to accomplish, then you just end up with a pile of tastes that never seem to balance and blend they way they should, texturally and  certainly from a flavor stand point as well.  I cant wait to go back there for wine, happy hour and more food. I will be testing the limits of this place and especially the kitchen, because my friends as you will soon find out, I can be a bastard.  (I saw a Chicken Pot Pie Gallet that was calling my name and some other comfort food that I only all to well know that if its expertly prepared, can be a slice of heaven...)  For a quick in and out meal with my sweet Godchild Salina.. it was a  perfect lunch with a perfect person...   P.S.  I am going to  reverse engineer that soup  for mw own selfish needs if it kills me..  3 stars and I will be back to see if they can secure the upgrade...",

My favorite appetizer is the Thai beef tacos. I usually steer clear of spicy things, but Switch does a great job of balancing all their flavors so you get spicy, cool, and sweet ( not just in the tacos). I have not tried any of their main dishes because my friends and I always order too many appetizers. I can't wait to go back and try their main dishes. Our waiter was great, when my boyfriend didn't like his drink the waiter asked how they could fix it.",

So I hit up yelp to see what was available and low and behold... Switch - open till midnight.  sweet.  +1 Star.  We were feeling like watching some arrested development so I offered to call in the order.  We ordered the apricot bbq chicken sandwich and the ham and cheese crepes.  They said 10-15min.  I arrived exactly 14 minutes later.  Walked in, and the food was handed to the server right after I told them my name.  +1 Star.  Got the food home and the chicken sandwich was amazing.  You could taste everything listed on the menu.  The warm chicken, red onions, feta cheese, apricot bbq sauce, aoili, cilantro. +1 Star.    The crepe was good, not great, but good.  Dont know what it was lacking, just didn't come together as I hoped, although the ham was top notch and was served with perfectly cooked asparagus. Not that mushy crap that they over steam.  This still had a crispy bite to.  +1 Star (the quality of the ham and asparagus gave it the bump).  So, for now 4 stars.  I'm interested to go back and dine in as the inside looked very cool and its even on central so the light rail could take my drunk ass home afterwards if I drank.",

On Sunday we decided to try it again after we flew in from our vacation.  It was about 1pm and we were there during brunch.  We were greeted and sat right away which was great.  We had a different waiter this time and just like the last waiter we had he was very friendly.  The difference this time was that he was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.  Also, I didn't say anything about having a gift card or about our last experience so he just flat out did a good job.  I believe his name was Angel.  He also did a good job of helping us decide on what food to get.  Both of our meals were good and our drinks were good as well.  I am pleased that we had a really good experience this time because I really like to support local businesses.  It really is nice to know that the owner cares about his business also.  Thank you again for the gift card and thanks to the staff for doing a good job.  We will be back.",

I loved the sauce, but it turned completely soupy to the point of drowning the poor tender chicken.  All in all a good meal, with two people we got out for around $75 with tip.

    "text": "Of, first the food and drinks.  Tried the BIG BLT, the aioli (sp) was good and the bacon would have been good if it was evenly cooked. The bread seemed stale and of there was lettuce I could barely tell.  In the end the sandwich comes close to, and I can't believe I am going to say this, too much bacon. Upon the server's recommendation I tried the Mac & Cheese as my side, I am a little tired of Ceaser Salads as a side, and I was not impressed. The sauce was not very cheesey and it was runny in a bad way. Also, I am sorry but if you are going to call it MAC & cheese then use Macaroni dammit! I am getting a little tired of people saying mac & cheese and getting Pennoni & Cheese or Linguine & Cheese.   The drinks were ok, except don't drop my garnish in the drink! I want a Bacardi & Coke not a Cuba Libre (there is a difference) keep the damn lime out of my drink. If I want it I will take it off the rim of the class and put it in myself!  I was there early in the afternoon on Friday and there was one other table. For being so empty it did take a while for my server to come over. She was nice enough by kind of inattentive. Overall I was give the service a 3.5 out of 5. It was the food that killed it.  Ok I am going to go cry about there being such a phrase. \"Too much bacon\" my god what a horrible phrase.  UPDATE: So, I decided to go back and give Switch another try under the exact same circumstances after an invitation from someone over there to come back. I tried everything I had before again and there were some changes. The bread was not stale anymore and there was enough Aioli this time to taste. The lettuce was still limited but I will say I didn't feel like I had too much bacon this time. (THANK GOD!)  Also the drink arrived with the lime on the rim. Thank you! While I need to try other stuff to increase the rating beyond a 3 I will say that it was improved!",

I was torn over where to take them as I wanted to go someplace friendly, chill, but with a little something that would set it apart from the many dining options in the Valley that was not another north Scottsdale concept restaurant.   We were greeted quickly and sat at a nice table by the window. Our waiter knew the menu very well and took the time to make suggestions. He was quick with our drinks - Italian vodka sodas are delicious - and he was able to accommodate a small substitution for my order of perhaps the best mac n cheese plate around. The place wasn't super crowded, but had a good number of people there to complement our experience.   It's a True testament to the quality of food for my parents to say it was the best meal of their trip, and that includes their previous night's experience at well-known place right next door.   I've been to Switch for dates, a casual Friday happy hour with coworkers, a birthday party, and now a dinner with the parents. They have been consistently top notch and a place I would highly recommend.",

The drinks were ok, they had a nice flavor, but I did not get the buzz I was looking for, so I just drank the happy hour wine.   The food was really good though. On Wednesday they have this cheese tray for 5 dollars. It was amazing. You have to get it.  The rest of the appetizers were delicious as well. I had these risotto balls. They were so good, I am still thinking about them. Everyone seemed to have a really good time.  Its not very baby friendly so I probably won't be back again since she is my foodie and we love to explore new places. If I had a sitter though and was invited, I would def be back.",

Luckily, the food across the board was quite good for a casual American restaurant. A steamed clam appetizer with bacon and jalapenos was excellent, and my Chillaquilles was legit. Others had sandwiches and salads and all were happy, especially with the cheap drinks. All in all, a good little find for downtown Phoenix.",

My partner and I went here on a Saturday evening and were both pleasantly surprised. It was still early enough that it was not very busy and our waiter was both delightful and extremely attentive.   As for the food, I tried one of the day's specials, the Asian Salmon Burger. It was delicious! It came with a side salad that had a mayonnaise-based salad dressing. It was nothing special, but still it tasted good. Sadly, I tried their red sangria, and I must say that as an avid sangria fan, I really did not like it. It was way too sweet and I am not a huge fan of sickeningly sweet beverages. However, my partner had the martini of the week, a watermelon infused something or other, and he really enjoyed it. I'm not a fan of gin, so I can't really vouch for it, but like I said, he really enjoyed it. For dessert, we went with the weekly special, strawberry shortcake. It was light and airy and we devoured it within minutes. It was just the right ending to a perfectly pleasant meal.     Although it is unlikely that we will make Switch one of our regular restaurants. We will definitely be back to try more of their dishes and would definitely recommend it to anybody looking for a new restaurant to try!!!",

I find that a lot of restaurants in Phoenix have issues with check-splitting; however, the wait staff here never has a problem with it and are extremely courteous and polite.   I had the Murano Chick and Prosciutto sandwich and a side of mac and cheese. Both were good, although the mac and cheese could stand a little additional seasoning. The time before I had their risotto, which I thought was bland. Everything else I have tried has been delicious though. They have some good speciality cocktails and good specials each week.",

    "text": "We partook in Dining out for Life last night at Switch because they donate 100%!  And for as busy as the restaurant was, they handled the evening extremely well.  We didn't have reservations (because we didn't know they were taking them) and were seated in about 30 mins.  Switch is already one of my favorite places to grab dinner... great food, great atmosphere and good people.   DOFL was the exact same experience.  The hostess seemed a little frazzled because they were just floods of people coming in without reservations but she did a great job getting people situated, kicking people out when tables were needed and overall maintained a positive attitude about the whole night!  Switch was also smart and had a few waitstaff just playing runners- getting refills, grabbing empty plates, etc.. so you never felt unattended to, V. Smart on their part!!  The food.. wasn't the best I've ever had here compared to in the past, but I'm sure they were just trying to get things out of the kitchen and to the tables as fast as possible.  My Smoked Turkey & Brie Gallette was a little on the peppery side and had too much cheese on it (I know- how can you have too much cheese?!).   The bf got the Creole Jumbo Shrimp and said he really enjoyed the flavor (he cleaned the plate so I have to assume he absolutely hated it!!).     Overall we left full, our wallets a little lighter from donating to a good cause and smiles on our face from good service.   Thanks Switch for another good experience and for donating 100% to DOFL!",

Any place that has a chimichanga on the menu automatically gets at least three stars. A fried burrito, you can't go wrong. I've never had one for breakfast, but this one was tasty and hit the spot. The peppers and the adobe chili were a great touch of flavor. The cheese sauce was a little odd, not quite velveeta, not quite queso nacho cheese from a can. I would have preferred fresh grated and melted cheese, but overall this was a yummy and filling brunch. The service was friendly and fast, and  I would be willing to go back for dinner.",

This is my go-to restaurant. Weekends are $3 carafes bloody mary's or $6 carafes mimosas.

    "text": "So here goes , last Saturday night on 11/14 my partner and I invited another couple from San Diego to join  us at switch for dinner . We gad only been a couple times and the service was good and we really liked the food . On this particular evening we started with drinks as we all like a good cocktail and since we were eating big meals we saw no issue . I admit our one friend was drinking more than the rest of us but he also had a designated driver and no one was being loud or disrespectful , after several drinks our waiter josh came over to cut off our friend from drinking , we were all surprised as we were not given any reason other than the waiter thought he needed to . My friends turned and looked at me since I am a food and beverage manager with Hilton hotels and asked if I would have. Done the same thing. I did say that it's up to the sever/bartender to make the call but there are other ways of making sure the Parton is ok or not , the server josh never came back to talk with us or offer dessert , another employee came to offer dessert which we did order . We thought maybe josh is busy but still no josh , he just avoided us like we all had done something wrong which made us feel quite uncomfortable. I'm sure this server just must be new to the industry but serious to ignore us all , we are all adults and we didn't even give him an issue when he cut our friend off or even ask for another drink for him as we wanted to respect that decision .. Making all of us feel so uncomfortable for the rest of the night was not a good decision in his part. We are very torn about ever going back or recommending switch to anyone again .. We all ate our food entirety even dessert that night and tried to have a good rest of the night talking with one another , as josh would pass by and not acknowledge us . I called him over at the end of the night to give me the check , he barely said 2 words, I just dint understand such behavior from another adult let alone your server that seemed to be pleasant at the start .. At this point we will have to say no to switch and just go to other places for dinner as we don't feel welcome at that establishment any longer , I work at a large Hilton property close by and have told this story to our concierge and we won't be sending any business there way until the owner sends us a very heart felt apology.. Thanks for reading .. Chris C",

We used to go here all the time after working at the VA especially on Mondays because burgers were 5.55. I don't think they have this special anymore. I've had the house, bleu and tejano burgers and they are delicious. The atmosphere is chic and modern will a great bar area and patio. Brunch on the weekends can get crowded but the alcohol carafes and food is well worth it. My only complaint is that they need an official sign with letters that attach to the building. They've had a temporary banner for the last 3 years. It can be difficult to locate if you don't know where it is.",

They were prepared so perfectly, I could not stop raving about them to our waitress!  The chef, Jason Peterson, all of a sudden came strolling out of the kitchen to talk to us!  What a really great guy!  You can tell he has real passion for food.  He talked about his mother being his inspiration and how he pulls from his southern background to create new twists on classic dishes.  The drink specials are an added bonus!  The BEST Bloody Marys, served in a carafe, delivered with beautifully garnished glasses with celery and large green olives!   You can't go wrong here!

    "text": "I've been to Switch at least a dozen times since my first experience at the Yelp event.  Mostly for the $1.99 drink specials they offer and the outdoor patio.  The food is usually satisfying, even the $1.99 paninis they sometimes advertise.  Service has always been good, but not great.  However, I visited Switch last week with two of my friends after First Friday, and I don't even want to go back after the sub-par experience I had.  The waitress was HORRIBLE. Extremely unfriendly, rude, cold, impersonal, basically ignored us the whole time, took forever to get our drinks, and didn't spare a second to make sure we had everything (or ANYTHING for that matter) we needed. She seemed more concerned with closing the restaurant down then making sure her table was taken care of. as for the food, it didn't get any better really.  I went with the french dip which lacked any flavor or bite to it.  It was room temperature when it came out.  The cheese had gone from ooey-gooey melted to wax-like.  Luckily I swapped halves with my friend who got the buffalo chicken sandwich (decent).  We ordered the sunrise magaritas which you could tell were made with cheap ass tequila and WAY too much of it. make them smaller and use better tequila and i think you'd be better off.  but fo realz, what the hell Switch? You killed my buzz for the evening and ruined my first friday. I didn't even want to tip the waitress and my friends ended up leaving her a substantial sum of money she should use to buy some lithium. Lesson learned. I should have waited an hour for Moira.",

All the reviews were good, so we wanted to give it a shot and I'm super glad we did. We sat in the patio which was pleasant. They have lounge patio furniture or tables to suit your mood. My wine was nice and my bfs sangria was good, but a little to sweet for me. The food was Amazing! We split the cheese and fruit plate, and then shared the Market  risotto. It was absolutely delightful. Only compliant, the music selection. It was not \"wine bar\" friendly in my opinion. It was as if the owner went on vacation and every server had picked the most random techno beat song they has on the iPod. Kind of weird, and not really fitting. Other than that, great place!",

The second sign: too much IKEA furniture. The third sign: the staff outnumbered the customers, and it didn't seem like the place would need so many staff people even if it were busy.  Here's the big one: the menu looks interesting until you realize that it's basically the same six things repeated in several different forms! Do you want those ingredients in pita form? sandwich form? panini form? They should just have a grid: carbohydrates on one axis, fillings on the other. You just point to the box you want. It's like subway.  The food was ok, especially because there isn't much in the area. But I was expecting something with good food like Fez, and this just disappointed.",

We had the special (scallops over pork belly with lobster risotto), chicken pot pie (definitely not a traditional take-Yum) and Lobster Seafood Crepes. All delicious, but the special was to die for. The wine selection was not as full bodied as a had hoped. Since it was my birthday, we had a scoop of coffee ice cream, which was a great palate cleanser after the seafood. We all agreed we would go back again when in the area.",

Bread didnt taste like pita and the hummus was missing olive. For main dish, I ordered Pot Roast French Dip, it was awful I had to wash my mouth with vodka to take that horrible taste away.  It didnt had flavor at all, I had 1/3 of it and the server didnt take his time to ask us how was our food. I  Won't come back to this place at all.  I advise you to skip this place.

The eggs were fake eggs but did not need salt or pepper it was really delicious. The French toast on the other hand was EPIC. The \"sauce\" of the plate was the syrup and was garnished with blueberries. It was simple but so delicious and the presentation was beautiful.  The ladies said their mimosas were also great and a strongly suggested beverage for the drinking diners!

We were told we would have to wait in the \"waiting room\" - 2 benches on the patio - and could not even sit in the bar.  A kitchen break at 12noon?

    "text": "So I went to Switch and walked into the back door, that faces Central Street and not the cozy entrance that would have been perfect if it wasn't so cozy. I need to come back and hang out in the couch-filled lounge area up front one day. (Has very little to do with the review, except that it must be super nice to hang out and drink outside when the temperature allows for such an endeavor)  Ambiance Its dark and cozy, in a hipsteriffic way - but the clientele doesn't shout hipster at all. I really enjoyed how they had the setup of this place, and the design and the atmosphere really works. The staff was way friendlier than the ambiance suggests - which definitely helps with reasons why I will be back. Not saying anything bad about the ambiance, because the place definitely is well thought out and designed - it's just that some people can be intimidated by hipster hangouts. I'm not one of them.  Food We had sandwiches. I had the Rioja Panini to which I added Prosciutto, and it was fantastic. For a sandwich, it was all I expected and more. Well done, generous enough servings and very very tasty. The presentation didn't lack either, in short this was quite nice.  Drinks Switch have some interesting beverages suggested on the menu. I tried some and they were tasty, quite strong and for $3 before 630. The only complaint I have is that some of their drinks were too strong for my date, (when do you ever get that complaint) but this was rectified as soon as it was mentioned to our server. I would come back for the drinks alone. (Especially if I can hang out in the before mentioned outside lounge area.)  Service I must say, if any of the categories above would have been negative, it still would be lifted by the service. It was nothing short of stellar. My party had a gentleman that was knowledgeable, opinionated (in an awesome way) and attentive. Yes, he made a faux pas by forgetting our appetizer, but that just left room for the dessert (which he recommended and was awesome). Stellar service, absolutely stellar.  Switch just made my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I can see coming here with any kind of party, it really made an impression on me, and I will bring them business. It had that kind of milieu that makes you want to revert to a more polite version of yourself.",

    "text": "Met up with a friend for weekday lunch..yum!  I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was super good.  We kept it simple since it was very hot outside and we're both light eaters, by ordering a cheese board/plate and the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad.  They were both very good and satisfying.  I am looking forward to returning and sampling other menu items, as well as taking advantage of their adorable patio (when it's not quite so hot out).  I would totally give this place 5 stars if not for one thing...we needed to keep our items gluten free for my friend so we asked for the bread to be separate from the cheese plate and for the salad to come without croutons.  Our server assured us this was no problem but unfortunately both were served with the bread on them.  We didn't make a big deal of it and just took them off rather than complaining but it is still annoying to be assured of an easy request, only to not have it be met.  Still great food though.",

    "text": "I had gone to Switch a few years ago with a friend for lunch I believe and because I don't live near Central I hadn't really bothered to give it another try. However I definitely can say I'm a fan after going back a few years later.   We were heading to a concert and decided to stop by Switch to change things up a little. I was very impressed with not only the friendliness of our waiter but most importantly the quality of the food.  We tried a lot of things and all were delicious. My main dish was the Mozzarella Caprese Ciabatta sandwich and it was delicious. I'm always worried there will be too much dough in the ciabatta and usually avoid it at restaurants but this one was perfect. Just the right size, tasted fresh and one of the better sandwiches I've had in a long time. My friend had a few starters, the mac n cheese which was very good and also their hummus with pita bread which was also good.  If there is anything I might have not liked as much was the sun dried tomato and pesto risotto but that's probably because I had my eyes bigger than my stomach and ordered it with my sandwich which was already plenty enough food for me.   I don't know if I'll ever go often but I now can say with confidence that this place has great food and definitely worth a visit if you haven't been.",

The flavour was great and the pretzel bun was amazing. One coworker got a sandwich and was asked if she wanted cheese, she agreed and didn't think much of it. However, when we got the bill, my friend was charged $2.00 for half a slice of cheese and almost $3.00 for her soda! My water was never refilled and the waitress did ask how our orders were, but was really contrite about it. Between the cost and service, doubt I'll be coming back again.",

    "text": "If you're going to make reservations, apparently don't use Open Table. Reservation for four on the patio out the window because only two tables available are high tops, which doesn't work when dining with a 77-year-old. \"Sorry, those tables are reserved\" is a weak answer to someone who also made a reservation. Apparently if you call in, you can specify a low-top. Use Open Table and you are left to the high top tables that you didn't know existed. Between this and the removal of the fish and chips from the menu, I'm done. Food is excellent but seems like there's been a hassle my last couple times here and don't need the aggravation  Added: the staff did find a way to get us to be patio table, which I appreciated a great deal. I do like this place but it wasn't a good night.",

I got the Chicken Pot Pie Gallette, Creme brulee for dessert, and a Caipirinha to wash it all down.  That chicken pot pie was flaky buttery goodness!  The non-tradition pie and crust with a delicious savory cream gravy was some good old comfort food eating.  Even after offering bites to some of my lunch patrons, I still ate it all up with a happy smile.  The green beans were also really fresh and crisp.  Although I was content with my dish, I gotta say I loved my friend's Mac N' Cheese Plate even more.  Oh man, how I wish I got the same.  Yum!  Their fish and chips were also pretty tasty.  I especially like the dill tartar sauce accompaniment.   Although I was full, I couldn't pass up on getting a creme brulee.  Let me indulge a little!  It was a decent brulee with the perfect caramelized crust and creamy custard goodness.  I ate it all, my dress was feeling a little tight, but I have no regrets.  The Caipirinha cocktail is a delicious mojito drink so no complaints there.  It was a bit light on the booze though but at 11:30AM in the morning, I shouldn't be out getting wasted anyways!  Switch is a swanky place with a cozy simplistic atmosphere.  I like it!  I would love to come back again.",

Recently, I came to visit for lunch and they changed their menu a little. I tried something new this time other than their Switch House burger and the thai braised tacos which are usually fantastic, which by the way are still on the menu. I ordered the dragon pita. I did not like it all that much. The sauce was all the way on the bottom so I didn't even taste it for the first five bites. Without it, it was dry and bland. I probably wouldn't order it again. My fiance ordered the cowboy burger and I asked him if we can switch. Being the great man he is, he said \"yes\".   The bill came close to $30 for two entrees. Parking is in the back off of Virginia and you go through the patio to get to the host. Try to get there early to avoid a wait.",

We tried the fried chicken bites appetizer and loved it. The habanero honey sauce wasnt too spicy and provided a nice zesty kick to get our moods going. The service was great as our waitress was timely in getting drinks and our food before the big party there had their food orders in which would take a while. I also had a glass of tasty rose, but boyfriend decided to not drink as the night before was his alcohol cheat night (hes on an intermittent fasting diet, and we decided that our next date nights are cheat days for him) He got a catfish poboy sandwich and I had the mac n cheese with bacon (always need that protein in!) He claimed that the catfish was the best hes ever had and he personally thanked the head chef/owner for the food. Also got a gooey cookie but was really rich and we were pretty much too full to eat it all. I'd totally go here again.",

I asked for water & never received it. When I gently asked again the server said she'd be right back with it & never did. Instead the table next to us got it. Super bummer on the service.

Our waitress on the other hand was awesome.  She brought out water (with lids) for the kids & was very accommodating as I try to figure which adult meal I can split btw the 2 of them.  I ordered the Country Club Panini for the kids which I didn't try.  But the Cesar salad that came with it  was pretty good.  My order was the open faced Focaccia Ck Salad Melt (Switch Special) 3* - bread was too hard but the side salad was not bad.   What I really enjoyed was my sister's Egg Benedict which was much better than the ones I had at FEZ.  I'm still kicking myself for not ordering  from the weekend breakfast menu.

Not amazing, not life changing, but solid good quality, good service and a very comfortable dining room.  Most recently was brunch with a friend. I am a huge fan of the $4 carafe of Bloody Mary. My heartburn isn't as big a fan, but that's what Tums are for!  We shared the cheese and fruit plate appetizer with the added meat option. The cheese of the day was a sage cheddar. Okay - it wasn't really cheddar. I don't remember the name, but it was similar to a cheddar and quite tasty. Add some salami, prosciutto, strawberries, grapes, jam, almonds, water crackers and baguette and it was a lovely way to start brunch!  I had the chilaquilles - not the best I've ever had - but quite tasty. Just think I'll explore other options next time. Nothing wrong with them - just not to my taste.  My companion had the special - poached eggs, asparagus and prosciutto. He was the clear winner in the ordering department - the presentation was photo worthy and while I neglected to ask how it was, he finished it all without hesitation - so I am thinking it must have been good.  Will definitely be back!",

I loved the restaurant as soon as I stepped in.  It's very modern and open.  In front of me was a  nice bar.  Our table was reserved for us and we were seated right away.  Once we ordered, the food came out fairly quickly.    I had the Spinach Feta Salad with Chicken (add on) with balsamic vinaigrette. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g?select=pw0Zm0E7aFdzpdY6pBXXBQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7...</a> It was delicious!  They weren't stingy with the meat and I was only able to eat about 1/3 of chicken but I finished all of my salad!    My fiance had the T ruffled Hanger Stead (medium). He said it was very tender with good flavor.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g?select=sacBv9z6S1zq2UzlMohXAA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7...</a>  Others ordered Spicy Burger <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g?select=koApdgY9xe4mt1aTMFs0tA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7...</a>, Wedge Fries <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g?select=pJD2rltJ-SGsn226U56TDA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7...</a>, Le Mans French Dip <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g?select=Lumr-KdIUA6v8T8Ofbyjfw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7...</a>, Chicken Sandwich <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g?select=TffVc2HLohKZstKe53DCAQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7...</a>, and Salmon Western <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g?select=LS5UAhL7N68h-2pn4uCSTQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7...</a>, which looked sooooo good.  If I ever return, I'm going to try this!  Our server was super nice and attentive.  The sandwiches are pretty big, so if you're a small eater, you might be packing 1/2 of to go.  They also have Happy Hour everyday.  If you're in this part of the town, give it a try.  You might like it as much as I did!",

As she came to get my food order, I ordered an appetizer to which she replied, \"sorry, we're out of that.\" Mind you, the place opens at 10am and its 10:30am. Wtf!?

Great vibe and atmosphere ..tonight was free wine tasting from (Southern wine ?) with donations to help Arizona animal league. we decided to stay a while longer for the tasting  .(Eh ,the wine was ok) ,glad we could help some animals, hopefully.  Switch itself was awesome ! We had a great time. The hummus was tasty,  really loved the lamb lettuce wraps these were super yummy and really flavorful . We also tried  a new drink to us called pom-pom passion ( light and refreshing )  friendly and fun service ( thank you)  we look forward to having dinner here .  Update;  Decided to have dinner here last night.  We started our night with the lettuce wrap app (chicken,feta and fig) loved it ! We both had the seared scallops with leeks and tomato jam ,it was a pretty plate and it was a delicious light meal .Blond sangria hit the spot .  This was our 2nd time,(HH was enjoyable) Dinner confirmed the following facts  -cool place, cool people,  a great place to relax and eat a decent meal at a reasonable price ( really inexpensive)   we will be back !",

A few friends and I were meeting up for dinner here; I carpooled with one friend and we arrive a bit earlier to see if we could take advantage of the happy hour menu. At most places, if they have HH specials, they will have you wait at the bar if you are waiting for a table, and will say something like \"OH! do you wanna order something off the HH menu? We only have a few minutes left!!!\"   Not here. Not only did the host snottily ask us if we had a reservation (which we didn't.... my problem with this is HOW he spoke to us), and then told us that we would have to wait. When we asked if we could order HH stuff at the bar, he rudely waved his hand in the air, gesturing towards the clock and huffed \"It's too late! HH is over!\" and walked away..... Which we actually had about 5 minutes till it was over, but ok. We definitely did not feel welcome here. Yeah, kinda started our experience here off on the wrong foot.   So we sat in the lounge area and waited for the rest of our party before we could be seated. The host reserved part of the long community table by the kitchen for our party, which is RIGHT NEXT to where we were waiting, and wouldn't seat us until EVERYONE was there. And it wasn't very busy either. I don't have any issues waiting for a table when it's busy and what not, but literally we sat right next to the mostly empty table with reserved signs on it for about 15-20 minutes.   Thankfully, our server was AMAZING and really nice - he made it a great night for us. We all really enjoyed our meals - and my burger was $5 since it was a Monday! It was delectable. We tried the lemon blueberry bread pudding, which was simply amazing.   SOOOOO, in review - our meal went from bad to amazing. Just wish the whole experience was awesome. I do plan on returning to dine on the beautiful patio, so we'll see how that experience goes.",

    "text": "We tried, we really did.  But there is only so much a customer can take before you declare, \"never again\".   I made a reservation for this place on the phone because I was told that it gets crowded due to their great happy hour specials, especially on Monday.  I spoke to a male on the phone and had an extended conversation about my party of 10 reservation on the patio. We discussed whether they seperate checks, the fact that our party needed to be complete before we are seated, etc. So I get to Switch and they don't have my reservation. Not only that, but the diva male behind the counter couldn't have been ruder about it to me or my other party members who got there before me.  There was no \"I'm so sorry about that\". There was no \"Let's fix this\". Nothing .  What we did get was \"You don't have a reservation.\"  I tried to expain that I spoke at length to an individual there.  The arrogant guy hosting didn't want to hear it and his reply was \"when your party gets here we'll try seating you, but it gets busy here on Mondays\".   Strike #1  So our party gets there and we opt to sit on the couches on the patio.  Did anyone wait on us?  No.  We had to ask for menus and we did get them.  Then we sat.  And sat some more.  It was NOT busy yet and most of the tables were still empty on the patio.  Strike #2  Finally a surly waiter comes up and begrudingly takes our order.  Between his mumbling and seemingly painful interaction with us, I'm not sure what was more insulting.  Strike #3  We got our drinks and persused the menu. It's a good thing they have a lot of options because we didn't see our waiter again for quite some time and we were able to memorize said menu.  We finally got our waiter to take our orders and we waited some more......   During our experience there we were laughing at how rude everyone had been and shrugged it off as them being irritated that we \"didn't have reservations\".  Then we saw another male from a party behind us stomp off declaring \"I'm going to find a waiter\".  Clearly we weren't the only ones dealing with slow wait staff.  In all, the burgers here were delicious, as was a friends' salad. However the rude staff made my decision solid: I will never go back there again.",

    "text": "When your adventure downtown to check out Pallatte ends up in defeat with a 90-minute+ wait due to the backlog of the kitchen (man, these guys are already victims of their own success), you mope for a second and head back home. But then, as you drive amidst light rail scenes from the apocalypse, you spot Switch, sitting rather unnoticeably right next to Durant's.   Lots of small tables on the back patio for all those banished smokers, inside is all trendo-lounge style with a flat screen TV showing the latest sports game. A long community table that could easily seat 20+ people is on one side of the room (what is it with Phoenix restaurants and community tables?). I'd say the place was fairly full with customers, but not crowded by any means.  Too late for breakfast, the lunch menu seemed fairly standard. I was a little annoyed that all the sandwiches came with Caesar salad as their only side option, and if you wanted to swap the Caesar out with any of the other sides (none of which included a lactose-free garden salad), it was $1.50 extra. That kind of bit. In any case, I ordered the Jalisco chicken panini because in writing it sounded excellent. Overall, I'd say it was a fairly decent sandwich, but I didn't really taste Jalisco anything (if there were any chilies in there then they were the most muted chilies that ever existed) that would have made it stand out from a standard but good grilled chicken panini.   While I was eating, my check was placed on my table. The server told me no hurry, and I could add something else if I wanted to, but if this was the case, why put the check on my table in the first place? Not helped that while I'm obviously relaxing with my coffee and a few minutes later that the check is picked up with \"is this ready?\". I hadn't even thought of reaching into my wallet yet, and she assured me, \"take your time\" again, but by the second time around this starts becoming awkward. \"When you're ready, just get my attention and I'll bring you your bill\" would have worked better. Or maybe after it looks like I'm obviously done with my meal instead of assuming I'm going to be done in 2 minutes. I didn't get the impression that the place was closing in a little while, so this subtle rush out the door was a little surprising. Switch has thus become yet another Central Avenue dining establishment that doesn't really know what to do with solitary diners. Which is their loss, because solitary diners like myself will then recommend or take their friends out to eat elsewhere.  In any case, I just paid my bill and left. Will I come back? Maybe, maybe not.   Depends if the wait at Pallatte is going to be half the day again...  2.51 stars.",

I think it is because it is a bit out of the way from other restaurants in the area, though it is close to a few other good ones. But the food is consistently good and the service is outstanding. They serve a mean cocktail too. Ask your server to recommend something for you. They will be happy to help you with the large variety of choices. I really love their brunch too.",

I had the mac and cheese of course, which is fantastic, and we ordered the lobster crab puffs as an app.  That stuff is phenomenal!  I really liked it.  It's not very often that you get actual chunks of crab or lobster meat when you order something like this at other restaurants, it's usually unidentifiable mush. I'm glad I can put Switch back up to the 5 star that I have always wanted to give them.  One more experience like the last and I will most certainly resume my near constant appearance at this lovely restaurant.",

After my first dining experience there, I wasn't sure I wanted to give it another chance, but I decided to after making plans with some friends for lunch. I am glad I did go back because my second time at Switch was 100% better.  The first time I went was with two co-workers and it was about 2 pm when we got there (we took a late lunch). It took over five minutes for anyone to even acknowledge that we walked in and there was seriously only three other tables at the time. Strike 1. We asked for another minute or two to look over the menu...well that turned into over 20 minutes. We kept trying to get our waiter's attention that we were ready to order and he kept ignoring us. Strike 2. I ordered the BBLT sandwich...stupid me forgot to ask for the bacon well done. Unless you like your bacon barely cooked and super soft, don't forget to ask for it crispy.  Then when our bill came, two of us wanted to use a card and one had cash. We asked the waiter to reduce the bill by the cash and then split the difference on the two cards (we've asked for this numerous times at other restaurants with no problems). When we got the book back, he completely messed up and didn't do what we asked. Strike 3.   My second lunch experience was much better. I stuck with the caesar salad which was very good. Our waiter was extremely nice and five of the six in my party wanted to use credit cards to pay. We wrote on the back of the receipt how much to charge and our waiter said it was no problem. Everything came out correctly, which was so nice.  All and all, Switch is just OK. It's not going to make the regular rotation of lunch places my coworkers and I go to though.",

The food was pretty good, had a slightly different twist on things than I'm used too but was still interesting and tasty. Ordered a bruschetta appetizer that was very good, my date ordered a chicken and risotto plate that he devoured, and I got their chicken pot pie which I found to be a new twist on an old classic. Overall I enjoyed my evening at Switch. Next time I think we will partake in their outdoor patio which looked very quaint.",

    "text": "THE MURANO At Switch 2603 N. Central Ave, Phoenix  If staff members at Switch take their sandwiches seriously, there was no doubt that The Murano brought no humor to my palate. This sandwich was described as the standout creation of an audacious combination.  However, when someone uses the word AUDACIOUS, I happen to think of Bear Grillis jumping of a Helicopter 20 thousand fee up on the air and then landing on a tiny ice cap in the middle of wild Alaska. Roasted chicken, gouda cheese, prosciutto and Greek olives , certainly gave me no chills. I was very disappointed on the bread. The construction of this sandwich involves the  exclusive use of Artisanal bread. I personally think the concept was misinterpreted by the builders.  By definition, Artisan bread is made by an Artisan Baker ; a craftsperson who is trained to the highest  of his ability, to mix, ferment, shape and bake a hand crafted loaf of bread.  And if the Murano  is prepared with this unique type of bread,  it was obvious to me the Artisan was off the day we came to eat. Here you describe your sandwich  To conclude our critique one must wonder if our low score on this sandwich was corroborated in part for the use of poor semantics.I would have never used the word  audacious in attempting to describe this sandwich, when every ingredient including the bread, was pusillanimous, that is spineless.",

I thought to myself, \"self, a lite snack and a drink while reading my ebook chillen at a cool table sounds good\" so self said lets look. Within two blocks of my hotel was Switch, I looked at thier online menu (site is high class) and saw a breakfast burritto for $6.75 and noticed that a carraffe of screwdriver, cape cod, or bloody mary was only $3. carraffe meaning to us maybe 12oz or so. Hey! sounds good to self so we headed out. Very nice cool, almost chic atmosphere, very casual and welcoming, staff rocks!!! I told the waitress/hostess that brought me the menu's \"just bring me the breakfast burritto and a carraffe of bloody mary\" acting like a regular. I figured going in that it would be a small taco size more than a burritto so imagine my delight when the dish came looking like something from \"Iron Chef\"! The burritto was 4\" in diameter with at least a 1/3 cup of sour cream, guacamole, and picante sauce each on the side! And then they set the 1 litre carraffe of bloody mary down. \"self\" I said, this is not the $3 specail we read about so after about 10mins I asked the hostess and she looked at me strangely and said yes, this is the $3 bloody mary. long story short,,,,,Walked in with $20, tipped the awesome waiter $3 on a $10 tab and walked out with $6 in my pocket, a nice buzz, a fullllllll stomach, and a very wishful attitude that all my travels could find a switch in town.",

The restaurant is decorated in very soothing blue and purple tones, and the seating is comfortablee, even though you are at a busy downtown eatery comprised of local residents and business people. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served, with fun happy hour and small plate specials throughout the week. I eat lunch here at least once a week, and the pannini's are great, especially being paired with a small cesear salad ILO french fries. BUT, if you love Potato Wedges, you MUST order the Wedges instead of the salad. They are cooked to perfection, and with the aoli they come with, its definitely worth indulging.

I've gone to Switch for dates, and while the place is always boisterous, it always feels intimate and private.  The decor is beautiful - lots of blues and browns with gorgeous local art hanging on the walls.  It's just an all-around great place to visit!  My favorites:  - The Blonde Sangria.  Hands-down my favorite drink in CenPho. - The hummus & pita, especially with lots of roasted red peppers. - The Cowboy Burger.  The BBQ sauce is just perfect. - The $6 carafes of screwdrivers & mimosas during the weekend brunch. Need I say more?  The staff is exceptionally friendly (and unusually good-looking!), service is always top-notch, and the food & drinks are awesome.  I'm a Switch fangirl for life!",

Parking wasn't too big of a problem for a Friday night, and we were seated quickly.   The ambiance of the restaurant is trendy and kinda dark in my opinion. The music was a mix of 80's/oldies and was very interesting. Between me and the bf we started off with the Crunchy Onion rings and margaritas, and they were so-so. Rings were traditionally breaded, nothing to write home about.   Tried some of the Switch House burger, and the Apricot Feta BBQ chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich was pretty juicy and flavorful, the burger not so much. The meat seemed to be a tad bit overcooked.   Overall okay, no standouts here.

A little bland in flavor, requiring me to re-dip the skewer/lollipop back in the sauce several times as I ate it.  I'd give that a 2.5.  The salad with berries, onions and pralines we good.  The dressing was a bit thick and it's served on the side so it's a little challenging to evenly dress the salad without putting too much dressing on it when you don't have a bowl.

The server was great. He was attentive and listened. We made reservations and forgot to note that someone in our party had a birthday. Once we mentioned it as \"It's this ones' birthday.\" The server took that cue and made sure to get us their birthday special cookie with melting ice cream.   I would go back over and over.

My room mate and I were looking for great food and drink specials around 8:00pm..  I reached out to Yelp and was introduced to Switch!  The $3.00 martinis (cosmo, lime or blueberry) are the stiffest and tastiest drinks I have ever had, outside of me making them at home.  The blueberry martini is my favorite and it comes with delicious fresh blueberries floating in the bottom of the glass.    The food is delectable, which is why I decided to have my second event for my group: East Coast Foodies on the West: AZ Edition yesterday.    I loved the clams, which came out in a cast iron skillet smothered in a yummy garlic and herb base with tomatoes, corn, and other vegetables with a side of yummy warm crusty bread.  I am also a sucker for the moist grilled and marinated chicken breast that is only $3.95 for a nice helping and creamy sun dried tomato risotto croquettes!   The ambiance is sexy, chic, and trendy; it reminds me of a lot of bars/restaurants on the East coast where I am from.  I truly felt at home, relaxed, and full.   I will be back, soon!",

When we arrived at the end of happy hour, we tried a few different flavors of their vodka italian soda's that were descent. I probably wouldn't order them again and try one of the sangria's or at my friends recommendation, the margarita. I ordered the very berry turkey with side salad and it was delicious!  The bread was wonderful and even the small side salad was really good with their house dressing. That patio is tucked away in the back of the building with cool lights hanging overhead. Service was good though she could have a been a bit more friendly. Looking forward to coming back!",

If i get to Phoenix again, I will go back to Switch",

It didn't bother me the fact he didn't listen to our request but it did bother me once we pointed it out neither the server or manager fix the mistake. Our food came out in the wrong order which I would of let go if it wasn't cold. The server never returned to offer us a new cocktail and that wouldn't of been as much if we had recieved water after our fourth request. We were compensated a comp on the food we didn't eat or order and offered  a $20 gift card in return. There was no favor done here we paid for a discounted messed up appetizer, a round of drinks, and a salad.... and wasted our evening in return.",

I prefer Switch for lunch over dinner but I guess it could be fun for a casual date night. The vibe is good, the music is great and its usually pretty full which gives it atmosphere points. Also a great place for a workday lunch with co-workers or clients.   They have amazing salads and sandwiches! Amazing. And they're huge you can totally share.   My Picks. Salads: Sangria Chicken, Spinach Feta, Everything Chopped (YUM)  Sandwiches: Very Berry Turkey, Sangria Chicken.   Appetizers: Hummus Plate   Drinks: Drunken Italian Soda - SO refreshing & tasty during the summer. Be careful - they're strong.",

They put on their menu that they have gluten-free buns (nice!), but almost everything on their menu is chock full of gluten (even Hollandaise sauce, which is just wrong, IMHO).  Server was attractive but uneducated about gluten-free.  Such a big, beautiful menu, but the gluten-free options were the same sad limited choices as any other restaurant's.  I ordered the Angus burger sans bun with goat cheese (an extra $1.50) in an attempt to spruce it up, but I needed a microscope to see the cheese.  Thankfully the cocktail was good.",

This place is pretty nice...I like the arrangement of black couches on one side of the restaurant which was right next to our long high center table. Very unique and feel to this place. Now onto the food...  While my bf and I were waiting for the other people to arrive so we ordered the Lobster and Crab Puff....which was amazing! for 12 bucks they gave us 6 really good sized flaky puffs loaded with crab and lobster meat and this amazing sauce...ohhhh baby! this is a must try! Next for the entree...I ordered the Crispy Risotto Croquettes - it's an appetizer but i just ordered it as an entree....since I was going to share the Sororan Beef Short Rib.. When you eat the Crispy Risotto Croquettes alone - - it's not as good but if you eat it with a piece of meat - - it makes a very big difference....it's kind of bland by itself so the meat adds a good taste to it. The pesto aioli sauce that comes with the Crispy Risotto isn't as tasty as it sounds.   As for dessert, I ordered the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough...oh my my was it heavenly! soft cookie dough baked into a bowl and top with a scoop of ice cream....simple yet so delicious!   Overall I was pretty happy with the taste of the food...a bit pricey though....the service was pretty good too... and they allowed individual checks....so if you went in a large group they allowed everyone to get their own checks...usually restaurants don't do that.",

Switch would be a great addition to any neighborhood here...I wish it were a bit closer.   The food is very well prepared and presented, and the brunch menu is fantastic. I've had several different entrees here, and found the quality to be very consistent.  I love the hip vibe of the place; a refreshing change from pretty much anywhere else in the Phx area that I'm aware of. Acid jazz, impeccably clean and tastefully modern. Parking is easy, the patio is great when the weather permits and $1 mimosas? Sign me up!  Come here to get energized before your day or sip on mimosas and start off fully relaxed.

    "text": "I have been to this place 5-6 times, and thought the food good, the coffee great, and the servers, especially the brunette with the ornate cube necklace, very accomodating.   So why the 2 stars you may ask? Well, we ordered coffee to go last first Friday. The man behind the counter pulled our shots into a plastic cup. Now I am not a coffee snob, but this does change the flavor, and not in a nice way. Also, I know for a fact that my friends had complained to a mangaer about this exact issue before (they are coffee snobs), and was told they would make sure the servers did not make to go coffee like this anymore.    Also, about 3 weeks ago, we had a brunch party of 12. Most ordered breakfast.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict, which sounded really good with the fried potatoes. Our server brings our food out with no potatoes, instead heaps of salad greens with our eggs and bacon. She apologizes, saying that the kitchen had run out of them and she had chosen salad as a sub instead of fruit or other items.   As a server myself, I know you don't automatically make a sub. You come out and notify customers of the situation, and allow them to make their own choices.  Several people had ordered the items they did for the potatoes, and although everyone ate their meal, no one was happy. We did not want to make a fuss as there was a bunch of us, and the place was busy.  My Benedict itself was very disappointing. The bread rounds underneath were not toasted nor heated, so by the time it arrived to the table they were soggy and cold. The salad was a horrible match, as the dressing did not work well with the hollandaise sauce.   All in all a rather disappointing meal.",

There weren't a LOT of people in there. A very loud older gay couple were in the corner by the window. I think they were on their first date or something as they were smiling a lot while looking cagey at the same time. Or, they'd been together forever and had just had a fight that morning and were trying to spackle together the relationship for just one more year. 'Please,' they think, 'let us beat Jerry and Steve in the Relationship Olympics.' Also, a tribe of pudgy 20-something girls at the table behind us who seemed quite pleasant.  Those banquettes are hard, yo! Yikes. I plopped down and bruised something important. But, I squoze a pillow under me (lotsa spare pillows in this joint) and all was well.  The Girl ordered a big ginormous salad and I had the Reuben Panini.  Now, Reubens are made with corned beef, not pastrami. I think they meant Straw Panini, but hey, a Straw Panini sounds dry and gross. The sandwich was good, the meat plentiful and the bread was just crispy enough. How crispy is enough? Who the fuck knows. I liked it. Also, the little caesar salad was delish (and makes me ask why the hell no one in this town has anchovies for my caesar salad! This place was no different).  The service bordered on obsequious, which I love. The staff were attractive and friendly, both sexes.",

I really like the decor inside and little back patio. Maybe it's the wine lover in me that has this place on my list of likes (damn, is it 5'oclock yet?!).  They have a GREAT happy hour. Happy hour wine specials make me feel so warm and fuzzy inside. The wine list is extensive and they have appetizers that nicely pair with the wines.  I have always enjoyed the food here as well. The menu is diverse and there is pretty much something for everyone. I like curling up on the front couches and talking, relaxing, and enjoying the lighting, candles and people watching.  I would LOVE Switch (and so would my spouse) if the service was better.  The last time we came they said \"It just got really busy, so we can seat you, but no one will be with you for about 20 minutes\". Well...okay. I appreciate the honesty I guess. So we ask if we can grab a drink then, and are told \"No, it's too backed up at the bar, too\". Well now you have made us pretty upset, because I love my wine and don't appreciate being denied that drink I have been waiting all day for!  So since then we have not been back, which is too bad. I think if you catch it on  a slower day  you will really enjoy yourself. Stick to happy hour, too. Slightly overpriced for what you get otherwise.",

Both the red and white are delicious, and include yummy fruit floating within.  I'm not well versed in the content of strictly traditional sangria, but I know what I like, and I like this stuff.  It's not too pricey during regular hours, and is perfect for a drink after work during the 2-4-1 happy hour.  The Italian booze sodas are also good!  Something I'd always thought restaurants/bars should have.  On Sundays, mimosas, cape cods (cran + vodka), screwdrivers, and bloody marys are all just a buck!  The orange juice in the mimosa is hardly fresh-squeezed, but who cares?  It's a dollar, and tastes good!  If a little sweet.  The bloody mary was also average - but, again, a dollar!  Who can complain?  The food at brunch was good, but I don't think it really warranted the price tag.  In particular, the potatoes tasted like they came out of a freezer - bland and unseasoned, and a little dry-textured.  That was a huge disappointment, as their fries are delicious!  Overall, don't come with high expectations for the food, and definitely hit the happy hour, and you should be pleased with the results in your belly and on your paycheck.",

I've only eaten here for dinner once, but their lunch and happy hour are both very good. I work about a block away, so it's a great place to grab a bite, and they usually can get you in and out of there in an hour.  So far I have tried the black bean veggie burger and the Caprese sandwich, both are delicious! They have wedge and sweet potato fries which makes it really hard to choose, but after trying both I prefer the wedge fries which is surprising for me, but they're really that good!  Yesterday the table next to me ordered the mac n cheese, it looked fantastic! I'll be giving that a try soon.  The girls and I decided to splurge at lunch yesterday and ordered the red velvet cake.  I'm not a huge cake fan, but this was very moist and had just the right amount of sweetness. Another quick tip for switch... they take reservations, even for lunch!",

I got a breakfast hot pocket i mean gallette, and my friend got eggs bendict.  I mean we ate the food it was alrighty, not bad but nothing to write home about.    I'll give it some ups for having funny people we sat next to, and it's got that kind of mood to it talk to the poeple next to you is kosher kind of thing.   Ha, there are also large groups of bears and their respective cubs that come there which is pretty funny.    Don't get that strawberry drunken soda it tastes like robitussin.  that margarita is pretty yummy though.",

    "text": "Went to Switch last week for Happy Hour. We were hoping to get some nibblies to go with the drinks and introduce us to the Switch menu, but $9 for hummus? Are you serious?  We had a few caipirinhas, which were excellent. Lots of flavor, and fairly strong. Our server was nice, but uninterested when it became obvious that we weren't going to spend a fortune. The host was a little bit on the rude side, and seated us on a white couch with stained cushions. Stained cushions do little for my appetite.  We might come back and try it again for lunch or dinner, but with so many other places to try...",

I would recommend the mac and cheese or the Cowboy Burger. Best burger I've ever had. You'll love the modern atmosphere and cute outdoor dining area, too.",

This past Saturday 3 of my friends and I decided to give it a try before we passed judgement. Three of us order burgers medium rare with salad, the burgers looked as though they were straight from package with grill lines already on them. One of my friends picked up his burger to take a bite out of it and greased poured out of it. The Cesar dressing had to come from a bottle as the salad was definitely bag salad. To add insult to injury our waiter was incompetent at best and had zero personality",

The selection of \"big salads\" on the menu is great for vegetarians.  I ordered the chopped salad and was very happy.",
