However, the breakfast options are limited, for example there are no breakfast plates with pancakes and eggs you have to order them a la carte.  Also, the wait staff  didn't pay much attention either to me or to the people on either side of me (coffee cups went empty for most of the meal). The pancakes were flat and lacked flavor, even after being doused with butter and syrup. For the price I was charged I could of had the same breakfast at Ihop or Cracker Barrel with tip included and still had money left over. I wouldn't recommend it.",

There are times when I order something that I've had before and it is completely different then the last time I had it.  I know a lot of people complain about the slow service but that is actually one of the things that I enjoy about this little kitschy place- it is laid back and my friends and I can go sit for hours.  The servers are great and friendly and I love the atmosphere- I would just love to see more consistency in the food.",

The second time I went for a healthier option and got the suki rice bowl - holy cow was I blown away. Perfect size and tasty! It comes with a small salad which was also very good. My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich which had a really good smokey flavor. Besides from the food, we had the best server I have had in awhile. Her name is Erica. She was fast, nice, charming, and on top of her game. I can't wait to come back and try hillside for dinner!",

After Chris left though it has taken a dive.  The service the last three times \"3\"! I have been there has been terrible. The people at the counter acted like we were bothering them simply by placing an order ( I am very sensitive to being respectful or them because I know working with the public is really hard).  The egg/chicken dish I ordered was slimy and there were odd pieces of bone in the mystery cuts of chicken. The tortillas were burned and greasy. The glasses/coffee cups were dirty and there wasn't any cream for the coffee. Also the tables and chair were sticky. Please wipe them off!  Unless someone can convince me there has been a huge improvement, I will never go back. This is very sad because it was so terrific to start with and my kids loved the patio which is so fun.   It was fantastic for happy hour. They have had some great wines- especially the Klinker Brick.  Very sad.",

    "text": "I started going there just because it's nearby, but now it's become a bit of a destination for me.  I find the atmosphere is just right, and this time of year (early Fall) they keep the rollup doors open allowing interior to flow into the patio area--though flies can get annoying. They also have good WiFi with power outlets thoughtfully provided all around the long bench area. It's a good place to camp out with a laptop and work or browse for a bit, which is frequently what draws me there.   Upon entering I always get a whiff of something delicious. This varies through the day. In the morning it's bacon. Lunchtime smells like bbq. Dinner can smell like chorizo.  The kitchen in an open area where you can see -- and smell -- everything as it happens.  The sandwiches are larger than most people's heads and ingredients are very good. I enjoy the cold turkey sandwich on wholegrain with the guacamole.  The chilaquiles aren't really chilaquiles. They aren't the ones I remember from student days in Mexico. They're more like tostadas.  Taste good enough, but a bit disappointing.  Service is always good. The music can be a bit loud, but the selections are appropriate for the kind of place.  All in all, one of my favorite places in the area morning, noon and night.",

She liked it, but it had too much Blue Cheese for her tastes.  The Blue Cheese was in really large chunks, and very tasty.  If you like Blue cheese, you will enjoy this salad.  The boy and I shared a cheeseburger and fries.  The burger was VERY good.  Puts it in the Top 7 or 8 burgers I've had in Phoenix.  Hard to say what was great about it - it just had a good charbroiled taste (nothing like Burger King's \"fake\" charbroil taste) and the ingredients melded well together.  The bun was also outstanding - toasted and crunchy on the burger side and freshly soft on the outside.  The fries were \"so-so.\"  We also shared the Guacamole and chips.  This was a weak point.  The chips were bland, and the Guaca was too chunky for dipping - you basically had to use a utensil and scoop the Guaca onto the chip to eat it.  The Guaca had I think little chunks of mandarin orange in there, which did nothing for the overall taste.  My son spit out his first bite and did not try it again.  A nice experiment, but I don't think a good one.  The kids drank Mexican bottled Coke, always a big fave.  All in all, we hit home runs on two of the three items, so that's a good percentage.",

I rarely eat beef except for here as the carne asada is tasty and burgers are cooked to order. My greatest complaint is that the iced tea always tastes stale.

Even though it was afternoon it was still busy. And even though it was lunchtime they were still serving breakfast - yay!  I ordered the pancakes with apple compote and bacon and boyfriend ordered a cheeseburger and fries.  The pancakes were huge. Two plate sizes cakes with cinnamon-y apples on top. The bacon was 4 strips and although they were thin they were good. The pancakes had a nice fluffy texture and a good flavor. The apples were just okay. They didn't detract from the cakes they just didn't really add anything either. I might go with the strawberries next time.   Boyfriend said his burger was good, not amazing but tasty. He said it was a little bland. But the fries were really good.  The atmosphere is a relaxed sophistication. It's a big airy space and the have lots of outdoor seating as well.   I will find my way back to Hillside Spot again I'm sure.",

I really like businesses that buy local, and I love the MJ bread that is served.  I was disappointed that there was not a vegetarian option for the Croque Monsieur, but I asked for my eggs over medium with gruyere cheese and they were perfect!  That is not easy to cook.  My companion asked for a substitution of ham in his omelet, and it came out very nice.  They also added some fresh avocado with my vegetarian request.  As far as the wait staff, we found them to be just fine.  In our first visit I had to send back my plate, and there was no attitude in returning my plate.  Each time our plates came out fast.  The only thing I might comment on is that there was no check back after we received our food this time.  I use to wait tables and that is standard to check back as soon as the food goes out.  When I gestured to my coffee cup at the waiter from across the room he promptly came to fill it up, so I did not find the rude attitude that people wrote of.  Honestly, this place may have been a victim of it's own success and it may have misstepped with some of it's old customer base, but they seem to be on track now.",

I've been here before, once, for breakfast and I was left with a general \"meh\" impression, too.

I ordered some Four Peaks beer (which I'm really happy this place does all local stuff) and a Suki Rice Bowl. Delicious! I loved it! Then ordered a latte that was served beautifully. Then decided to do some cake. BAM! Awesome.  And the atmosphere was great. Low candle light, doors open to let the beautiful night air in, friendly and helpful staff. Maybe I just hit gold that night, or maybe I was drunk, but it was a lovely place for dinner and to hang out with my husband, who also really enjoyed his meal.

I love love their setup: open kitchen and bar, cute outdoor patio with hanging string lights, pet-friendly, a decent amount of baked goods, craft beer and wine bottles up front. I also like the suki's bowl on their menu - very well-thought and flavor-focused combination of ingredients. They also have friendly and attentive staff.   Despite the fact that this location has so much potential, I think they can do better with the menu. First time here, I ordered a bowl of clam chowder on their special of the day menu since I wasn't really hungry. It was average from the presentation to the taste. Second time around, I settled for an order of croque madame topped with over medium egg, side order of fresh melons and extra crispy hash browns. I also got an iced toddy.  It was nice of the server to leave me (a little bit too much) room and a side of classic syrup so I can customize my toddy. The food took a while to come out yet everything was at room temperature when they got to my table. Although the egg was cooked perfectly, my extra crispy hash browns was mostly soft and soggy :(. Croque madame was also average. Considering it was my first time trying croque madame, I can't tell if this is exactly how it supposed to be and I just happen to not liking it; or I can get better croque madame somewhere else. Fresh melons were cool and sweet, though!   Overall, there are few things I like about this place, especially their decor. There are also basic things I can care less for, that they can improve on. The 3 stars were given for the layout, service, and suki's bowl.",

A lot of people aren't into dairy like my fiancee! When we complained about that and wrote them an email about it, there was no response from their customer service.

The coffee is great, they got me my half caffeine without looking at me like an alien and the breakfast burrito was spot on. Overall a nice chilled place with cool decor and open kitchen.   Staff could make a little more effort with manners and customer service, however, I did not have an unpleasant experience because of this.",

Their pancakes are delicious and Phoenix magazine (I think it was) gave Hillside one of their 'Best Breakfast' places based on different breakfast categories. BUT...a few weeks ago they were cited by county health department for 6 violations. More than any other restaurant in the county for that period. Read the reviews about the flies? And I do remember being bothered by a few flies while dining inside the restaurant. Now I think we know 'why the flies.' So stupid. What a waste.",

We walked in around 11:30 and the place was packed, so we assumed we'd have to wait for a table. We were given a menu to look at while we waited, and 5 minutes later were led to our table.   Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, and he filled our waters regularly throughout our meal. The breakfast menu had many options, most of which were southwestern cuisine. There was also an option to create your own breakfast sandwich.  We have not been for lunch, but with our breakfast experience and the promising menu options, we'll probably be back for lunch.   The outside patio area looked inviting, with comfortable seating and a fire pit. I'm sure it's very pleasant in cooler temperatures.   The coffee bar at the front of the store was very accommodating for someone who doesn't always have time to sit down for a meal. It looked like you could order any beverage and various food items from the to-go coffee bar. I'll definitely be back in to get some of their delicious coffee!  I definitely recommend Hillside for breakfast or brunch... Or at least for their coffee!",

Got to restaurant and was told that actually unless our 5 lb dog was a service dog, we could sit at a little table on the sidewalk, but couldn't sit on the patio. Understandably, they don't have a permit for that. So, my Mother sat outside of the open gate with the dog, while the rest of our party sat on the patio, because there wasn't room for a party of 8 on the sidewalk. Patio was nice, food was ok. Got a \"fancy\" burger, but it was over cooked and flavorless. Grilled cheese bread was over toasted and hard, kids cheeseburgers were over cooked. Service by waiter was good, hostess and I believe the manager were nice, but miscommunication was an issue. Maybe I just had my hopes set too high. Prices were good. 5 adults and 3 kids only $69.",

From looking at the photos from previous years it looks like they updated from a diner feel to a hipster coffee/ brewery type feel. I love the open kitchen design, you can see your foods being made fresh. Despite the design it doesn't smell like a diner so you don't leave needing to change your cloths. The service has a laid back and friendly feel but is always pretty speedy.  Sometimes we sit at that bar and that's always really nice and kind of fun too.  We love that this place is local and supports other local businesses.  The food? Always amazing. Healthy and more indulgent options to satisfy everyone. Plus there are a lot of create your own options to satisfy even the pickiest eater. My current fave is the farmers market omelet, the hubby loves the 3 dollar plate of bacon.

They have a bar there too so I also had a mimosa which came with fresh squeezed oj.   Came again for dinner a week later and loved it again.  The grilled chicken was delicious, also had chips and quac for a snack that was good. Honestly I don't think you can really go wrong with anything on the menu.

However, I've come back four times and each time gets significantly worse - mainly the time it takes to get served. The most recent time, I sat outside for more than 15 minutes before I even got a menu. I also find myself saying \"no, I only have an hour, I can't go to Hillside\". Such a shame because they are super close to me, their atmosphere is nice, and food is pretty good. Their staff is friendly and I believe they're doing their best, but maybe they're not used to the size of the restaurant it is because it can be a 10-15 minutes between the times your server comes by. Making it easily an hour or two ordeal, even if you're by yourself. But hey, if  you've got a good two or three hour window to have a sit down meal, this is the place to come!",

I particularly enjoy the Croque Madame. Ugh..I'm salivating like a Pavlovian dog just thinking about it.

    "text": "This morning was my second experience at Hillside Spot. Both experiences have been mediocre at best. The first trip we attempted to order the Croque Madame as it comes and veg style. To our dismay we could not get the dish veg style because it comes completely pre-made w/ ham. For a spot that seemingly tales pride in specialty, local and quality, one would think their signature item would be made fresh to order.   The second visit consisted of below par juevos rancheros w/ soggy \"country potatoes\".  Let me clarify, country potatoes are supposed to be diced potatoes usually fried or baked w/ butter or oil. These were hash browns and nothing more...  Lastly, the wait staff was dull and uninviting. There didn't seem to be any communication between the staff whatsoever. The table in front of us sat in different stages of dirty for the better part of 15 minutes while every server/busser passed by, glancing each time.   The space itself is lovely. Reclaimed wood, lots of sun, and calming colors. This is a place I may come back to just have an early morning coffee and work, although the coffee is nothing to write home about.  Oh, and on the way out several staff directly looked at us and didn't see us off... I mean I understand if you are busy but they were far from it.",

It looks like this place may be hit or miss, but it was an absolute hit with us.  We were promptly seated, offered a kids menu  and drinks and the waitress checked in on us as soon as we sat down. We thought the service was great. My husband had a flavorful and juicy burger that we both raved about and my rice bowl (I know-weird selection) was delicious and fresh. We were very impressed and can't wait to try brunch.  I'm a huge yelp reader, but I never write reviews and after our experience tonight I was compelled to say that I sure hope this place  keeps it up because our experience was  just what we hoped for on Friday night!",

    "text": "Tonight was my last visit to the Hillside Spot, and here is why...  BAD/HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE BY IGNORANT MANAGEMENT/OWNERSHIP   Last weekend I called in an order for my fav - the el gallo breakfast burrito and paid to upgrade to the corn. When I pulled into my driveway I received a call from the manager telling me that he gave me someone else's order by accident, so there would be no corn. Okay fine no big deal ... I let it go.  This weekend I called in an order, and it seems like they hadn't changed up their features in a while, so I asked if they could do the brisket omelette for me, since they had a brisket sandwich on feature.   And when they had a brisket omelette on feature it was AMAZING!! Everything seemed fine, and they had done this before for me ... Typically they charged me the feature price, however, tonight there was once again ... more inconsistent behavior.  Apparently, the manager said to charge me for each item in the omelette separately, which increased the price to over $17 ...   QUESTION: what reasonable individual in their right mind is going to pay $17 for an omelette that normally cost them approximately $10/$11 in the past?  ANSWER: NO ONE ...BYE FELICIA!  I'm done w/ this place ... It's a joke.  Needless to say, I refused to pay that absurd price, and told them to keep it.   WTF is wrong with the management/ownership here!?!? Are you deliberately trying to sabatoge your own establishment, so people don't want to return?  MY ADVICE:  READ you're YELP REVIEWS and step it up before you end up going out of business!!",

The atmosphere could be really cute, but the lack of friendliness and customers made it feel very awkward and quiet.  After all was said and done, our $20 rib eye with a side of stir fry bell peppers and side salad (which literally was just a bowl of wilted arugula - not even a crouton), $15 shrimp and veggie pasta (which was penne pasta with what looked like the same stir fry mix in an oily/butter sauce) and two $6.50 glasses of subpar wine was definitely not worth it. And to top it off, a server set down the to-go food and walked off. I had to ask another server if they wanted me to pay the bill before I left.  I expect far more from a restaurant's atmosphere, customer service and food quality for $52.13.",

The coffee is TERRIFIC! The food - at least what we had - was mediocre. The disappointment was that this place has the makings to be a great joint - not just ok.   My husband had the Corque sandwich. It was ok but the sandwich didn't have enough spread & was a bit dry. He also ordered hashbrowns. Wow, how can you mess up hashbrowns? Well, make them like shoestrings & serve them cold. That's how ya jack up hashbrowns.   Anyway, I had the egg, avacado & chorizo burro. The menu offers brisket & pulled pork. I asked to sub the chorizo with brisket & was told that the brisket & pulled pork weren't ready yet. Another disappointment. So I chose chicken. My food arrived & it was ok but flavorless. No seasoning - at least none I could distinguish. Their fire roasted salsa came with it & it was very good. (I ordered a point to take home with me). It was what made the burro edible.   Service was slow. They were busy but I waited almost 20 min for my salsa & the check. My server was nice & she was good at checking on us & keeping the coffee flowing. Just slow at the end of our meal with the check, salsa & change.   Will we go back? Maybe. I think we may try their lunch. You know how it is - sometimes a place is good at one or the other - lunch or breakfast - but maybe not both. But so far we rate it a 3 star.... maybe lunch will change my mind.",

Been here for both breakfast and lunch.  Breakfast was bad, lunch was good, and I need to increase the sample size if I want to possibly up the rating here.  On this last visit I ordered the Brooklyn chop salad with a side of house made potato chips.  The chips were quite good.  And the salad was one of the better salads I've had.  Romaine, radicchio, olives, sun dried tomatoes, pistachios, salami.  The salad was not over-dressed and the mix of textures and tastes was good.  My friend ordered the Derby salad which I had a bite of.  It was fine - both salads were quite fresh.  He asked for his dressing on the side so his salad was also not over-dressed.  I would definitely come back here for the salads.  It's breakfast that really lowers this rating to just okay.  Ordered the chilaquiles and was sorely disappointed.  The serving was tiny, just a small handful of chips, that has been soaked through by the time they were served.  The sauce was underwhelming.  The egg was the only thing that partially saved the dish.  I vowed never to order it again.    I'm going to be back to give breakfast another shot, and I will definitely return for lunches here.  On balance though, will stick to the 3-star review until I taste more stuff.",

When there was an issue with our order they were nice enough to comp it and express their apologies. I will definitely be returning!   Update as of 03/11/17 Lovely place!!! The bacon and cheese burger was fantastic and our sever Erik was very nice and attentive. He was kind enough to scour the restaurant for mustard for me. Fantastic food, fantastic service. 10/10 would recommend!!!",

The first time, it was absolutely spectacular. Everything I wanted. Perfectly cooked, egg was runny and amazing. Just delightful. The next day, it was considerably slower inside, but my edges were slightly burnt and my egg wasn't runny at all. A little bummed at the night-and-day from one day to the next.   The Mexican corn with Oaxaca was pretty awesome. Got it on recommendation of our server the second day, and was super pleased. Outrageously messy, but good.   The mister got something yummy the first day which I don't remember (but clearly was good enough he didn't complain about going back the next day), and the special turkey reuben the second time. Reuben was interesting - coleslaw instead of sauerkraut. I wasn't totally sold on the idea, but he was happy with it.   We sat on the back patio until our food came. The swarm of flies was tolerable when we didn't have food on the table, but I spent more time swatting them away and defending my plate than I did eating what was on it, so we moved inside. Sat inside the second day and still noticed a few flies on the window, but the experience was much more tolerable.   Friendly service, tasty food, and breakfast available all day. (Super important to a third-shifter!) We'll be back.",

We have wanted so badly for this place to be a success that we have continued to eat here even when we have had the worst service imaginable, and even when the menu was going through its own growing pains, and even though we had some meals that were so ridiculously inconsistent it seemed impossible that the cooks were being given the same recipes.  This morning we went in for breakfast, and after a short wait we were seated. The server was delightful--friendly, but she also knew instinctively when to come and go. I saw a lot of new faces among the staff, and I also saw a lot of tables turn over, which used to be next to impossible since getting a check used to be like waiting for a dr.'s appointment at the VA. I remember so many times I got up to get my own drinks or even grab my own food from the window because the server was chatting.   They have also reorganized the menu, and I really like it--some of the same foods but with many more options like make your own omelets and burritos. I really hope they can keep it together. It's not like they haven't had enough complaints about the service. They know it's an issue. I hope they have found a way to solve it since we would like to continue supporting them.",

The place was very crowded and with a line waiting to be seated which lets you know there is something good about it.  The service was not great but not bad considering how crowded it was, but the food was delicious. We order the egg and chorizo torta which is a basically a sandwich but with a different kind of bread. Knowing what a torta really is supposed to taste,  this was very close  and very good. The percentage of chorizo to the egg was perfect!    We also ordered a bowl of fruit and it was good, no cantaloupe, honey dew or grapes, it had different berries and types of fruit. All the dishes they serve to other people also looked very good.  The only thing I thought was very expensive was the latte and the chia  and had to send it back once as they brought something I did not order. I will definitely will go back and try some other food!",

I got the grilled cheese as well- meh. The fun part was the surprise chunk of bacon and four pieces of shaved lettuce in my fries. It was almost as if they dumped someone's leftover fries on my plate. Wouldn't have minded, but I don't eat pork :/  Nice staff but super slow!  I sat, starving, while I watched the people that arrived and ordered after me, happily stuffing their faces.   All in all, not worth the drive nor the wait. Sadly, I will continue to hunt for the perfect fries in AZ.",

The restaurant has changed things up from time to time for the better and they always have great food.  The staff is always cheerful in the morning and they make a great mocha.  The also get bonus points for having an actual \"large\" mocha.  It's been awhile since I ate lunch or dinner here, but I'll have to scoot by for happy hour and update this review.  The breakfast menu has been updated to add a few new things and keep the old favorites.  I highly recommend the Huevos Rancheros Verde it's my usual go to breakfast and the best I have found so far anywhere in Phoenix.  The verde sauce is great ( not really spicy though ) and the Oaxaca cheese filled tortilla is delicious. If you aren't in the mood for eggs the \"Hit the Spot\" pancakes are a huge portion and really good.  Order the hash browns crispy though as they tend to be on the limp side if you don't. They have plenty of tables, a counter, and an outside patio for dining.   Try: - Huevos Rancheros Verde - Mocha - \"Hit the Spot\" Pancakes - Croque Madame",

The grilled veggie sandwich, however was DIS-GUSTING. The veggies were sopping in oil/grease and were put on the driest piece of bread I've ever had. I couldn't believe that's what they considered the healthy option. The Blue Sky burger was no better...but then again we wouldn't know because the only flavor you could taste was the blue cheese. This place was the biggest disappointment in a long time.  Overall, even with three and a half stars this place is overrated. Just sayin.",

They also have live music- yesterday was a young couple & they were good!  Went in around 7:00p and was a bit crowded but we were able to get an outdoor seating immediately (on a warm day I would totally recommend the outdoor patio).  Service was quick! We ordered and within minutes the food came out.  My friend and I shared the \"build your own grazers- American prosciutto w/fig jam & Brie w/tomato jam. The jams went well with the meat & cheese, so delicious!  For my entree I ordered the half salad half sandwich- asado salad & vegetable torta.  Both were good! The asado salad was like a Thai peanut salad. The vegetable torta was nice & warm; the bread was soft too.  For dessert we shared the red velvet cake- absolutely amazing!!  When we asked for the check, the waitress was able to split the check without a problem.   They also serve breakfast all day!! Who doesn't love breakfast for dinner?:)",

    "text": "This is a go to spot for us for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. We are here pretty often, so can say that it is consistently good.   The breakfast sandwiches and varied egg dishes are delicious and satisfying. The pancakes are light and fluffy.  We mostly get chicken related sandwiches are the full mesquite chicken or salads for lunch and dinner. The chicken is always spot on and very tasty. We wish there were more vegetarian options since we have been underwhelmed with them before (other than the salads, which are great).   We usually get the fries for sides, which are great but the corn is fantastic as well.  They always have a handful of good beers on tap and a huge selection of cans and bottles.   Service is usually very good.   Over several years we've only had one bad food experience with the Friday fish special and it was quickly remedied.   We'll keep coming back and would  be here even more often if they had more veggie options.",

Slow ordering process and a bit crowded with food items on shelves right behind the ordering line...need to move that stuff and free up space for people to comfortably read the menus and get ready to order.  The ice tea set up needs some reorganization...it's a deadend into the windows and tables and people cannot flow through as they should to keep things moving.  Turkey sandwich was good - not great, but good.  Appeared pretty lonely on a lunch plate with a sliver of a pickle...come on it's a pickle you can charge more but at least give us a bit more than a sliver.  Ordered my sandwich and asked for mustard but no mayo - they skipped the mustard AND the mayo.  How about a few chips, or a bit of pasta salad on the plate to keep my turkey sandwich company....  If you go with a group, expect your meals to come out one at a time vs. all meals for the table at once...I noticed a lot of guests sitting there with 1 or 2 meals served while the others at their tables sat and waited...get it together Hillside - use one \"poker chip\" for the whole table and bring the food at once...  It's a cool place, they'll work out the bugs.  I'll go back to try breakfast and maybe even dinner (after Feb. 1st)...but they need to just observe the flow in the place...oh yeah, and for such a 'cool' place...who needs gas station energy drinks on the counter....de-clutter dudes it will be 'cooler' yet.  It's nice, needs to work out the kinks, but I hope it makes it...good crowd and lots more coming in as I left...",

    "text": "Usually the food can redeem a restaurant. Not this time. The pancakes were good, but not fluffy. When other yelpers say the service is bad, they're not lying.   When we first came in, they said a 20 minute wait, which is fine on a Sunday morning. That was not an issue. There is a \"market\" when you first come in, I ordered an iced coffee, it took about 10 minutes to get that. Now, I can be reasonable and say that that cashier was a server and was clearing out other guests bills. But come on, if your a \"market\" have someone manning the register and making the items your are offering.   Once we finally got seated, the server was very attentive. He got our drinks and let us discuss our what were going to order within our party. When he returned, he wrote everything down and I am assuming he entered the ticket. But he did not return to get us a refill for about 10 - 15 minutes. About 5 - 10 minutes later, someone in my party had to ask the server when we would expect our food (after we had already waited twenty minutes), he said \"less than two minutes.\" It a came about five minutes later.   I ate chilsques verdes, and at least I can be some what certain that the chicken was not from a can. I got a piece of bone in one bite and in another bite I got chicken cartilage from a drum stick.   I believe if they continue to have this bad service, it will eventually bite them I'm the butt.   The real reason I am giving them two stars instead if one, is because the atmosphere is very nice. The experience was way too bad for me to want to give this place after chance. Nor is the food redeeming enough. And also, for the amount of food you get, this really should be a $$$ restraunt.",

However, while they have a walk-in and take-out coffee bar, it is definitely a restaurant. There's no place to really just sit and chill. Restaurant-wise, it's a little loud, but i really like their breakfast options, which they serve all day, and they are reasonably priced.  I don't drink beer and I haven't been there for dinner, but I guess they have a lot of craft beers and wines.  I just wish there was a nice, shaded patio with misters and/or more of a sitting area for those that just want coffee.",

There were no apologies. The server noticed us after we started making forts out of menus. 2.  Two servers noticed us, but went on their merry way. 3. Inaccurate beer list - I get excited about beer. They didn't have 3 beers on their menu. The server didn't know what they had in stock. 4. Overpriced beer - $9 for beer you can get for $6 at Bevmo. 5. Flies - holy Pete Sampras, a crap load of flies. We had to eat fast just so the flies wouldn't get our food.  We went to Dairy Queen across the street to make up for the horribleness.",

Spoiler: it doesn't. Every meal I've had here is wildly mediocre. The desserts are good.  I was really quite upset on my last attempt though.  Usually I order breakfast/brunch items but seeing as I've had no luck with those I opted for a simple sandwich. Something basic so I would at least not have a bad lunch. I went for the tuna melt figuring even if they opened a can of tuna, mixed in a scoop of mayo, put it on toast, melted some cheese and charged me $9 it'd still be good. Oh, how I wish they just did that. It was, quite honestly, disgusting. The tuna, what I could taste, seemed to be chunk light and had a cornucopia of items mixed in. This included fruit. Fruit in my tuna salad. There were so many things mixed in I could barely taste the tuna OR cheese. The bread it was on was good. I should've just ordered toast. Additionally, while the fries are made in house they are not good either. Clearly they're not blanched because they're soggy and had no seasoning. Lastly, as you've read in many of these other reviews the service is pretty shoddy.   It is a cute restaurant with all the signs that it'll be good but be warned; looks can be deceiving.",

Sat on the patio to enjoy the day. Service was efficient & pleasant. Food was hot, portions were a good size, well made & tasted very fresh. We thought the price was fair. Stopped on the way out & brought a mini lemon Bundt cake and a petite chocolate cake with raspberry filling for our dessert tonight.  Will be back again & will recommend to others.

On the menu is a note stating everything is made fresh and prepared when YOU order. Perfect!  We took a while to read everything on the menu, the waitress was patience enough with us and helped us finally decide what we wanted to order.   Once we ordered the food came fresh and delicious. Eggs were cooked to perfection and potatoes were heavenly.   We took some pastries and cookies for the road. Melt in your mouth deliciousness. We will be back for lunch or dinner on our next visit.

I can tell its mot prepared per order kindly just because i dontt want to believe my neighborhood breakfast place whether doeant know how to make ice coffee or serving old coffee. 5) no customer service Server gentleman literally turn his back and go to cash register while i was asking a question about food twice. Besides the smiley girl servers seem very lost and not knowing what is going on (its fun to watch tho) Good part was the place was not over priced. That is the only good part I wouldn't go again  If it is your first time dont expect too much.  I was going talk their manager to explain and suggest couple of things to improve but i found out there are many other options around the area to eat breakfast so hopefully they do well soon...",

The crepes as well are exceptionally good, and the coffee beverages are great.  They also have a very solid beer selection, not that I'm always drinking alcohol early in the day :)  Along with my review, my boss (a foodie from Maryland) insists on working at least one day at Hillside on her quarterly visits to AZ.  Seriously, SO good.",

I liked the vibe of the restaurant and saw that they offered a variety of craft beer . I got the El hefe omelet which had chorizo and veggies with a side of sourdough toast. My husband got one of the Torta breakfast sandwiches with a side of potatoes. My omelet was good but my toast was super hard and it didn't come with any butter. Also it would have been nice if my omelet came with a side of salsa but they had hot sauce on the table so it wasn't to bad. The torta sandwich was filling and my husband enjoyed it. I wasn't a fan of their potato and glad I didn't order any. It looked fresh but it was super Stringy looking and no flavor.",

I ordered corn on the cob and mac and cheese.  The waitress later informed me they were out of mac and cheese.  She suggested french fries which I got.  They were overly salted.  When reviewing the bill I was charged $1.50 for each side order.  The waitress removed these charges at my request since the sides are included in the price of the steak.  The patio is nice and I might consider trying breakfast here but wont be back for dinner.",

We also ordered mimosas which were unsatisfying as well. While they were tasty there was so little mimosa in the glass that it felt like a total waste of money ordering one.

The waitress came by and asked our drink order and we said the manager was already coming back with our drinks.  She left immediately.  She came back after a few moments and said that she will be our waitress, implying there had been some confusion about that among the wait staff.  She left again without asking if we were ready to order, which we were.  Then a third time she comes back to take our order.  The manager drops the food off at the table and the waitress comes up about two seconds after that and asks if we're okay.  We don't see her again the rest of the meal.  No drink refills, no nothing.  Even after we were finished, we waited around for ten minutes for the check.  I'm extraordinarily understanding of bad service usually.  It's usually they're short staffed or due to shit management policies that fuck things up and not the server's fault entirely if at all.  But there's was a ton of wait staff there for the amount of customers.  The kitchen wasn't backed up apparently, as our food was prompt to arrive.  The waitress was just crap.  And she seemed totally oblivious to the fact that she was crap.  She was unfriendly AND incompetent.  You should really not be both.  I hope she finds a job that suits her better.  She's woefully bad at serving the public.  Points off the the manager as well for passing our table three times and not noticing our craning necks and empty cups.",

My husband and I were SO happy when they went in after our beloved Coffee Plantation left that we really wanted to give them a chance...  And now that we've been there separately, together, for take-out, sit-down, breakfast and lunch... I can honestly only give them 2 stars. It's horrible that I can't run over there for a salad when my kids insist on McDonald's because I know I'll wait forever and that my nearly $10 (with tax) salad won't have bacon or will be so small in its plastic to-go container so as to make me say \"never again\" and \"I'd rather pay $5 for the Grilled Banch Ranch Salad at McD's. Ugh, I hate that I just wrote that! But at least they have my food ready right away and NEVER forget the bacon.  My first experience was way back when they opened and I loved their pancakes with bananas and creme fraiche and peanuts, but the side of bacon wasn't quite cooked right (I should be able to request \"fatty bacon\" and not get snappy-crisp bacon, right?) but since then, every time I've had them since, it tastes like the batter wasn't mixed thoroughly and I taste the egg... if I wanted eggs, I'd order them. And I have. The farmer's veggie omelet has always been to my liking and the coffee is fine.  The croque moiseur is quite good as well.  But overall, I'll agree with many of the reviewers in that the quality does not quite justify the expense, especially when you consider the wait time (25 minutes for a to-go salad and there was no one ahead of me on line!) and the generally indifferent staff.  I don't plan on trying them for dinner because I'm assuming I will come away with the same \"meh\" feeling. Sorry.",

Service was still lacking (slow and inattentive) and the kitchen always seems slow getting food out. My biggest complaint is the ridiculously large fake fica tree that takes up about 1/6 of the floor space. Tables are squeezed tightly together to make room for this monstrosity which requires servers and customers to engage in an impromptu game of limbo to get around it. It really needs to go.  I do hold out hope for this place and the huge patio has a lot of potential. With the right furniture and shade the patio could really be on par with the Vig.",

The last stop falls under the former, we stopped by to check out their happy hour specials which were great for beer and wine, but our server didn't mention any food specials like the HH Menu photos state.  The boy ordered the Brisket Burrito special which he liked, but was mostly full of filler and not a lot of brisket.  I ordered the Blue Sky Cheeseburger with fries and was disappointed.  The beef had no seasoning what so ever and tasted flat.  The french-fries were cold and soggy and the side of ranch dressing was runny and flavorless.  The Boy watched our food sit in the warmer window for about 5 min before it was served.  There are some menu items that are truly worth the trip but with the Russian roulette of bad service good food and good service bad food it makes it hard to want to come back.",

What I didn't like on my last two visits (lunch last week and breakfast this morning)  is the feeling of dirtyness all around me.    I watched someone grab a rag from a square bucket sitting on the ground,  ring it out,  wipe down a table and then drop the rag back into the bucket (half in and half out with part of the rag touching the floor) repeat this same process throughout our meal.  (see photo). The fans are very dirty,  bathrooms are very dirty.  These are the areas that we as customers can see... Makes you wonder what we don't see.    The age and vintage feel of the restaurant is great.  Love that it's a part of the history of Ahwatukee,  but it doesn't have to be dirty.  It doesn't cost anything to clean...   I really enjoy this restaurant and would love to come back,  but not sure if I will until I know they change the cleanliness.",

Ordered my egg over medium and it came out over cooked. Server was very friendly!  Iced toddy (cold brew) was also very good (I added vanilla and caramel to it).  I would give my breakfast experience 4 stars.   Came back this afternoon for the Happy hour spread and was way less impressed than earlier.  $10 graze board was good and our drinks (wine and beer) were also nothing to complain about.  We sat at the bar, where 3 different servers were standing. 2 were discussing how hungover they were from the night before.  One of them ordered a meal and then proceeded to eat said meal at the prep area in front of the food window.  We also observed one of the cooks wearing gloves take out his cell phone, text, put his phone back into his apron and then walk over and handle food from the grill/line (no change of gloves nor hand washing in between).  The ice bins were left open the majority of time we were here, and the ice bath the (uncovered) berries had sat in that morning was only water for our afternoon visit (berries still uncovered).    This might sound slightly nitpicky, however as a fellow member of the food service industry, my eye for food safety is always focused.  Because we did not witness the same conditions at breakfast as we did at happy hour, I wouldn't mind coming back for another morning meal. Past the breakfast hour however, I don't think I will be returning.",

It came with pieces of bacon attached, a couple of beans inside the omelet, and just extremely greasy. Obviously they just threw the eggs in a pan that had been used before cleaning it. Not good. I would rather wait a little bit longer to have a descent omelet than get served what I did. Btw the coffee cup also had a streak of coffee stain on the outside.

We absolutely love the food but the employees just bring this place down. I sat at watched the food runner mope around looking half asleep and hating his job. He kicked the door open every time he went to the patio. His shoe prints were all over the door. He came inside once and pulled the door open so hard it actually hit the customer on the outside. He was taking food to the patio and he cut off some customers who were being seated. When he brought our food he asked if we needed anything else and my husband asked for more Splenda and he was CLEARLY annoyed with that request (he brought 2 packets). I cant believe this place is ok with this kind of \"customer service\". All three times we have been here we have had terrible waiters. The upside to today's meal was the girl who took our plates when we were finished. Very nice girl and did more for us than our own waitress. I'm all for supporting local businesses but you need to earn my business. Just because you are local to me doesn't mean I won't cross the freeway to Crackers where I can get better customer service. We decided today we will give it one more chance then we're done. I hope it doesn't dissapoint.",

    "text": "Very nice and busy neighbourhood breakfast place.  Closest comparison I can think of for such a busy place would be Liberty Market in Gilbert.  I had the Corque Madame.  Its was well done with the right amount of cheese and ham and the fried egg was good.  I was a little disappointed that the only side it comes with was just a fruit cup, but then, what kind of sides do U give to a carb heavy sliced of bread anyway ?  I guess fruit is the best choice in this case.  I saw the Huevos Rancheros my friend ordered, he liked it very much too, the server even offered him a side of a spicier salsa when he asked if the sauce was gonna be spicy.  He does have one little query, why does it not come with beans ?  It comes with potatoes and a fruit cup too but we asked the server about it and he says, they usually don't serve beans with huevos rancheros.  But those are two small things that did not affect my overall experience by too much.  Because based on what they cooked and offered, the food was well made and very tasty.    I will definitely be back again because the coffee is really good (no longer cartel but also a local brand, expressions), service is excellent and food is well prepared.  I don't know what kind of service the other people here received but we had a very good server who kept coming back to refill our coffee.  I did see that the table next to us with a different server were visibly displeased when their server was too busy running around to refill their coffees often enough.  Also the server did come over and apologize to them, when we got our food before them, though we got in behind them.  I guess you can't control the kitchen and maybe the server was a little younger than our server, thus might have appeared a little more rushed, but I dun recall him being rude or away for too long.  Their coffee cups stayed half full most of the time still.  I will need to come back again to sample the other food choices, apparently they serve a good dinner too.  I guess it would be prudent to come earlier here on sunday for brunch as the farmer's market in the corner brings in a big walking crowd.  I imagine on saturday it would be pretty packed too.",

    "text": "Ok.. maybe it's me.  Maybe I just bring bad luck and trouble with me when I go here....I don't know...it's so confusing..  I keep going back every month or so because I really want to like the place and make it part of my routine.. it's in my 'tukee neighborhood, the food is really good when it's done right and it's an interesting building and setup.  I repeat, I want to like this place.  A lot.    So I took my brother from San Diego who's in town there for breakfast this morning around 9:15AM or so.  Knew we were in trouble with a line to the door  and only one cash register working at the counter.  It took about 15 minutes to get to the counter and there were another 20 people behind us.  (Popularity and poor customer service practices are not giving this place sufficient time and space to clean up their act.)  We ordered, got our number and he sat and I went to the coffee counter to get my Americano.  While waiting on my Americano at the counter I ask the young man 'what's up with this line and a 15 minutes wait to order?'  His response was 'it's because we're so popular everyone wants to eat here'.  Say what? So that justifies a 15+ minute standing wait to order?  I suggested he go  to US Egg in Tempe to really see how a popular and very successful breakfast lunch place delivers excellent customer service.  He made some snide aside to his counter mate, I got my Americano and sat down.  To wait. Dread set in once again.  Bro and I waited 15-18 minutes for our food.  They were out of tableware when I got up to go get some so someone brought us some from the back, including a nice plastic fork. Classy eh.    Breakfast was good.  Oatmeal, eggs, toast.. A couple of proteins with this eggs for Bro.. All done well.  They do get their food right most of the time here.  It's the service level that since day one has been and still can be very iffy.  I get they had one out of two counter cash registers broken.. And that's not my problem as a customer.  What's their back up plan?  Or it is to make people just stand and wait?    We ate, talked.. and waved at flies.  This place has more flies in it than any restaurant I've ever eaten at in this country.  I saw several folks at tables next to us also doing the Hillspot fly wave. It's been that way since opening. I still don't know why.  The really need to get on top of this.  Now.  Flies. Food. Bad.  My bro, instead of leaving as a raving fan of the place, left, like me, shaking his head.  This place really really needs a customer service excellence intervention.  And soon.",

    "text": "Eh. Was very unimpressed. Came here for Mother's Day breakfast as it was the only Ahwatukee area breakfast joint I could find with healthy menu options that wasn't a chain.   First, the ok part. The food wasn't bad. Nothing special, but not bad for a quick breakfast. I had the farmer's omelette with fruit on the side. My boyfriend got a breakfast burritto that he said was pretty good, but the \"potatoes\" inside were just french fries. Really?   We were seated on the patio, which was fine because it was fairly shaded. There were flys EVERYWHERE. I understand that there is only so much they can do when you're outside, but it was gross. and, the seat cushions were all filthy.   The service sucked. The hostess was just sort of dumb, and not especially friendly. We did get our drinks refilled in a timely fashion, which I appreciate, but our waitress had zero personality. zero. When we first sat down she came up to the table, without even saying hi, and took the sweetener packets off the table to give to the table next to us. Didn't say a word. When my boyfriend's mom asked about the hashbrowns, the waitress said \"they're just hashbrowns\". It's like she didn't know how to communicate with real people.   Given the owners of the place, I expected A LOT more. It's fine for a quick bite to eat, but don't expect friendly service our outstanding food. Ahwatukee could really use a quality breakfast joint, too.",

I love the lighting, lots of light and they have a nice outdoor area with a fireplace to boot! Now the coffee...their chai lattes are freakin awesome and my boyfriend had regular coffee which he enjoyed as well. Moving on to the food, I had the farmers omelet and it was amazingly delicious for a vegetarian omelet. My boyfriend had this breakfast sandwich, can't think of the name off the top of my head, something \"gallo\" but he thought it was amazing and it looked amazing as well. It's a little pricey but the food is well prepared, very healthy and good portions (not too much, not too little). I love how they support local products and they serve microbrews!!   The downside?? THE FLIES! Like someone mentioned below I was doing the hillside wave to swat the flies! My boyfriend and I rolled up the newspaper we were reading to kill a really annoying fly! There were several flies, I don't know if it was because we were sitting by the window, but they were annoying!  Overall I would go back because I love the atmosphere, the food is delicious and healthy, and the coffee is yummy!",

The food is consistent, and the fact that is is a local place, using local product is what made us come back over and over. But today was just a disaster. Waiting for someone to approach your table for 10 minutes, to finally have this waitress whose face loudly shows \"I hate my job, I would rather be dead than being here\" is a huge turn off. We love this place and went there to see if we could organize a brunch for 20 people; but after today's experience, I would be embarrassed to bring anyone there. I realized after reading other reviews on Yelp that I am far to be the only one complaining about service, and am wondering when changes will occur. There are other local businesses around where I can spend my money. Needless to say, the $1 tip I left today was way too much for the \"service\" received. Management: retrain your staff, be more selective in the hiring process, and teach them how to put a smile on their face.",

    "text": "5 stars for ambience 3 stars for food  Okay, let's get one thing straight, it's NOT the best place for breakfast in Ahwautukee or the East Valley; I don't know what is, but I do know Crackers on Elliot and Hardy offers better food. The appeal of this place comes down to it's ambience. It has a very urban feel and reminds one of the breakfast places in San Francisco or any large cosmopolitan city. Everything from the black chalkboard menu to the funky sodas to the Emo/Snow Boarder waiters who yell your name out. Think La Grande Orange in the East Valley! You order at the register and they bring your food to you. You get your own silverware and sauces.  It was also suprisingly quick.   The pancakes came with peanuts, caramel syrup and whipped cream. Honestly, it would have been better with nothing on it. The toppings did nothing for it aside from making it too sweet. The pancakes themselves were what sold me on it as they actually had flavor instead of being like your typical IHOP or McDonalds pancake that is flavorless until you drown it in syrup. The Turkey sandwhich was good but largely because of its bread, other than that, there was really nothing special about it either. I feel like even Teakwoods, the sports bar on Ray and Kyrene has sandwhiches that are more unique like its BLT with a fried tomato.  We had the pancakes and the turkey sandwhich. Both were excellent but both also had something missing. I would probably come back here for the combination of the ambience and the food as opposed to the food itself. I wasn't blown away by the food but the place was a lot of fun because it's unique. We certainly need to support more places like this if we want more non-chains.  The bottomline is it's worth going to because it's fun and it's a great place to take people. Nonetheless, it's clear people have allowed the ambience and vibe to affect it's opinion of the food. The food is good but not noteworthy",

It drives me crazy but I think after last night it will be awhile before I go back.  This place is like an abusive relationship (they never treat you right but you love them!).  The food is pretty good.  I really like their pancakes, very rich and fluffy.  The croque is good.  I love the bread.  The pulled pork and carne asade are favorites and I really enjoy the house dressing.  The guacamole has an interesting taste and a fair beer and wine selection.  I also love their coffee.  That being said I have to agree with everyone else.  Their service is subpar and it is shocking because most times I go there are probably only three to four other people in the restaurant with three or four servers talking behind the counter.  They are not really accommodating with the menu.  I dare you to ask for a simple tweak without getting a huge sigh out of one of them.  I can't put my finger on it...maybe the owners or management are mean and that rolls down to the staff but they just seem really unhappy and put out about stuff.  The weekend mornings are hoppin' and it really rattles the poor boys and girls that work there (what?!?! People want breakfast?!?).  Don't get the girl who wears jean shorts and tennis shoes.  Just get up and leave if they put you in her section.  Seriously.  I like the space.  They play good music and the food is not bad but I think it bothers them when customers come in.  Oh and happy hour doesn't apply on Fridays even though their sign says \"Mon. - Fri.\" that was the straw that broke the camels back for me. obviously they don't want people to eat here.  I'll just go to the whole foods cafe instead.  Until I forget again and give them another chance in a few months.",

I started off with a Caramel Latte with an extra shot of espresso; it was perfectly balanced no bitterness at all. There was a nice foam on the top and little caramel left on the bottom when I was finished, YUM! For my entree I had the El Jeffe Omelet which had fresh tomatoes, spinach and chorizo. It was pretty tasty (wish it was served with some sort of salsa), I also had the \"country potatoes\" which were really seasoned hash browns. The hash browns were a little salty for my taste but I mitigated the salinity with some ketchup and it was just fine. The atmosphere has a relaxed modern feel. I can definitely see myself going back here again. The service was a little slow since there was only two servers but I'm understanding.",

The food got worse than it was before and as there was not a whole lot of people there at 3pm for lunch, I was surprised by this and the fact that it took almost 35 minutes to get our food.  Five times of coming here has added up to mediocre food, cold food, and to be quite honest shitty crappy slow service!  Don't know what it is because they have a good menu and location, but maybe they need to find people to work there who take great pride in service and food quality.  My carne asada torta tasted like ten day old meat that was scraped off of the ground in the back during the morning breakfast rush!  Anyhow...five times is enough..I won't be coming back as I know that I have given it enough chances to become a regular spot of my dining experience!",

The menu is very similar to LGO, that is where the similarities end. The service in this restaurant is so bad,bad,bad! What a shame the food is consistently fresh and tasty. They need to clean house and bring in a seasoned manager to whip these sluggish people into shape! I agree with a previous poster. The staff are indifferent., sloppy, give no eye contact and are obviously poorly trained.  What a shame. The potential for a great restaurant is there if the service was even remotely good.",

Good coffee Great scones They've done a good job on the environment Staff is friendly  on to the cons...  the review below describes a lunch take out order  Serving staff does not have a snap to it attitude, little to relaxed, stood at counter waiting to order take out for about 5 minutes prior to cashier who waled past me three times even acknowledged me.  Food was mediocre pushing bad.  Ordered the croque monsieur.  How do you screw this one up?  Let me tell you how, the bread was good, sliced too think, and burned around the crust.  The bechamel sauce must have been put on with a fire hose, way to think.  Too top it off the cheese layered on top, was also burned, not lightly golden, black burned.  This sandwich was severally out of balance and tasted poorly.  The chicken was OK.  It had a nice smoky grill flavor.  It was moist.  Here's the rub, the skin was burned,  I like a nice char as much as anyone, however the skin was burned.  The asparagus was very good, had a nice grilled flavor.  The french fries were not good, floppy and not nearly crisp enough.  My overall impression is this place has potential.  Good ambiance, good menu.  Winning comes down to execution and so far i give that a poor rating.  Sorry guys, I do believe in second chances so I will try again.",

Wait time at the cash machine is way too long, communication (like get your coffee here, get your water/iced tea there...) was weak, and method of delivering food also chaotic.  i think some strong management would go a long way with that place and i hope it does.

My friends and I come here a couple times a month and every time something seems to go wrong,but this is by far the worst. Our water was served with no ice and everything is overpriced! You can tell they have never owned a business before. The servers and the hostesses were rude. Everything went wrong, but the manager was nice when we talked to him. We won't be back!! We are a younger group but we are paying customers and we did not appreciate the service. We only ate the food because we were starving and waited longer than an hour to get it.",

I have been there 3 times, 1 time when they were busy and the other 2 when it was slow. Every time I had to wait over 15 minutes to order and over 30 for my food. I have worked in the restaurant businees for 30 years. I have never seen a restaurant so disorganized when they are busy. They need to have a manager on the floor taking care of things. I did not see one person in charge following up on problems. Chef Gordon Ramsey needs to save this place before it goes down the drain. The only reason this place is still in business is because there is no competition for it. Ahwatukee residents are desperate for a good local restaurant and they are willing to put up with bad service and cold food because there is nothing else around to compete with it. Good Luck on improving or just get out of of the business!",

Bacon was not good - overdone and not fresh.  Hostess was on the phone when we walked in and after 5 minutes of servers looking at us standing in line and doing nothing the hostess got off the phone and finally sat us.  Waitress shown up and is 9 months pregnant. Good for her! But when she had to leave due to expected contractions the rest of her team dropped the ball and we waited 10 minutes for someone to get our bill and that was after I approached another server asking for it.  They drop the ball on team service. Food is bland and without creativity. Coffee was only thing they seem to do well. Pass on this joint unless you enjoy disappointment.",

We walked in and it was  kinda packed but no wait. Sat down and got our waters in no time. The server took our orders n I was happily expecting my old usual--the el jefe omelette. Then, we waited for over half an hour! In my memories that never happened here. We can see how the kitchen was so busy and the owner had to go in there and help out. But we'd appreciate it more if someone would come to us just give a simple apology or explain the situation. Anyways after a while we got our food. My omelette looked nothing like what I've used to got. It was so dried n kinda burned. And that certainly did not looked like an 4 eggs omelette. Fiances carne asada sandwich wasn't bad. I had to say something at that point. So I talked to the owner. He was very nice just like before but I'm sure he doesn't remember me anymore. He immediately apologized and explained the kitchen was busy and it's their mistake. He asked me if they can make a new one for me but we really had to go. So I told him it's ok I just wanted to let him know the problem but I'll still eat it. He then brought us the check, took off the omelette and apologized again. We really appreciated the way he treated us. Services there aren't bad. But I'd say you should stay closer to your customers. Let them know ur kitchen is busy or give a simple apology if they have been just sitting there for 20+ mins",

We were first told we might have to wait 45 min for a table, we did have a group of six coming on a Saturday at just before noon then the host seemed a little annoyed when we asked to wait at three open spots at the bar while we were waiting (we were ordering mimosas and coffee so not sure what the fuss was about) but 45 min turned out to be more like 15 and not all of our party had arrived yet so it was prefect timing. Service was good, food was good. I wouldn't recommend the chips as a side choice. Despite being a little \"far from home\" I'd return.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try Hillside after rave reviews from my boss so when he suggested he take all of us to lunch there for Administrative Assistant Day several of us anxiously accepted.   Got there about 11:30 on a Thursday, 3 tables outside and about half of the tables inside were occupied. Food being prepared looked awesome. Following directions the 7 of  us sat ourselves in the back at a long table. A very nice waiter came over gave us menus and took our drink orders. It literally took 15 minutes to get our drinks and to have our order taken. I ordered the turkey sandwich with a side of fries. After ordering it took another 45 minutes to receive our food. My sandwich and fries looked great. Quality ingredients prepared with care. To my surprise my fries..ice cold, not  luke warm, but cold like when you go to throw away the McDonald's bag and there is one elusive fry that has tried to escape, and you know its not going to be that salty, crunchy, greasy, hot fry you want but you have to eat it anyway and then regret it. It was that type of cold. The bread on the sandwich had been sitting out so long it felt like it had been toasted, but it hadn't. It was such a shame too because the turkey was flavorful and the lettuce, tomato and avocado so fresh. Honestly though, I have had a better turkey sandwich at QT for $5 and it came with chips and a drink.  A co-worker ordered the Chilaquiles Verde and hers was so cold the cheese had congealed and the yolk on fried egg on top had started dry out, . My boss asked if she wanted to send it back but since we had already been there over an hour she said no.  Someone else ordered the Mesquite Rotisserie Chicken, he said it looked better than it tasted.  Our waiter even though nice but way over worked..they looked a little short staffed. He was working all of the outside tables plus several inside and the flow of the cafe just didn't look like it worked. We never received refills on our drinks and my pricky pear ice tea was the high spot of my experience.  Hillside uses quality ingredients and maybe I just visited on a off day, but from what I had today I won't be returning.",

    "text": "Very disappointing...   I have been coming here for years and the quality has been consistently declining. Today may have been the final straw.   The last time I was here was with my girlfriend. We were seated on a hot day at the only table receiving full sun. The table was also rickety. When asked about moving the table or going to any of the other empty tables in the shade, we were told it was okay if we moved the table our selves.... Okay... The server was very nice, but very slow and forgetful. We ordered a coffee and a side of jam with the food. It took about 25 minutes for the food to arrive which is reasonable, but the server didn't check back once in this time. When the food arrived, no jam and still no coffee... fine it happens, not a big deal. So we ask the food runner to let our server know about the missing items... 10 minutes later she stops by, and we let HER know about the missing items. She scampers off and it is literally the last time we see her. About 5 minutes later the coffee is dropped off by someone else, and...still no jam.   At this point we have eaten everything except for the toast. My girlfriend still wants the jam so we ask for that... it arrives about 5 minutes later again. We finish the toast in a couple minutes and sit with an empty table for another 10, Until the general manager stops by with the check for us. We let him know about the issues we had and he says one word, \"okay\". Leaves the check and walks away. Pathetic.    To be fair the food was really good. That time...  I should say that I have worked in restaurants for 10 years. I have worked as a server, a bartender, back of house, and management. Virtually every position. I am very understanding and very forgiving. I tip well and generally try to make the staffs lives easier.      Today I was sat at the bar and service was fast and friendly at first. I ordered the two egg breakfast. An item I have ordered a dozen times. The item I ordered in the story above in fact. Unfortunately, the toast came out almost soggy. It was cooked on the griddle on one sided only. The griddle side was soggy with butter and the other side was completely soft and uncooked. Not a big deal I think, it has never come out like this before. It always has some crispness to it, even if they \"toast\" it on the griddle.  A couple minutes later the general manager walks by and asks how the food was. I let him know about the toast. He says one word \"okay\", then turns around and calls back to the kitchen to get another order of toast. Sure enough it comes up exactly the way it came out before. The server checks back this time. I pick up the toast and show her how it bends in half if you hold it on one end. It is obviously greasy and soft.   I try to explain that I've never had it this way before and I'm really not feeling it. I suggest that they may need to check whats going on with the ingredients or the kitchen. Instead of asking what they could do to make it right, offer something else, or offer to take it off the bill, she looks at me annoyed and says \"Okay\". They didn't even apologize. The GM was standing behind her listening to this interaction the whole time. It's just pathetic. On top of it the rest of the breakfast was disappointing as well this time, for example the hash browns were soggy and barely warm.   I know how to run a top notch front of house staff. Keep them happy and make the customers come back. The whole time I was just itching to step in and start fixing their problems. It is clear that the problems in the staff are coming from the top. I sure the GM has plenty of talents, but running a half way decent front of house staff is not one of them.   Because I have had enough decent meals here I could be coxed into coming back, but it would probably take direct outreach from the GM or owner at this point.",

We just both thought the food was mediocre. I got a burger with bacon, caramelized onions, and an egg on it and my friend got the croque monsieur. The burger was good but nothing terribly special and the fries were kind of soggy and flavorless. My friend thought the same about her food. I got a slice of chocolate cake to go and it tasted very box -ish. It wasn't bad and it was very large, but it didn't have a homemade flavor.

Coming from someone who has been here various times throughout the day I can say that typically the quality of food is fresh and tasteful, but about two months ago we stopped in around 11 A.M. only to encounter a horrible experience. The food was stale and tasteless. The servers stood around appearing to laugh sarcatiaclly while water glasses at several tables stayed empty and coffee cups continued to lack refills.   A Few weeks later we returned. The food and service were better but there are some staff and one manager that clearly don't enjoy their jobs (turn off). This place is usually good but when it's bad-it is really bad.  Wifi-the consistently reliable wifi is reason enough to come here and give it an extra star.",

I also ordered the special mac and cheese which came with chiles and chorizo and was so creamy and cheesy with a bit of spice. So good! Two of my dining guests ordered the ribs and noted that they fell off of the bone and were delectable. Two others got the pulled pork sandwich and spoke about its amazingness for the rest of the night. The service was amazing and the ambiance was great for a casual dinner. Definitely recommend.

    "text": "What was once a wonderful establishment where you could come and hangout with your friends and enjoy fine dining (breakfast, brunch and lunch too) is now something tasteless. I mean that quite literally. I use to come here several times a week because my friends were working here and we all lived nearby so we'd spend a lot of time eating up the menu. I notice their corns are still a hit! But upon moving back recently from college, I wanted to give it a try since it been a few years. The reason I am not giving this place 1 star is because our waitress was very sweet. I can't remember her name but she was a pretty blonde girl with glasses, we adored her! She was so prompt, kind, and had a great personality.   Now for the food. I have always ordered the carne asada sandwich. I ordered it recently and there was absolutely no flavor. What once use to be a delicious carne asada that had this flavorful marination and sauce that would drip as you took a bite is now a very dry, disgusting, plain, no-good sandwich. I mean really? I am paying a little over $9 for a sandwich that has dried up steak meat with avocado thrown on top? and french fries that were plain and dry. No thanks.   My boyfriend ordered a chicken sandwich with corn on the side. His chicken was not only over-cooked and super dry, I am pretty sure there was NO sauce in his sandwich either. It had no flavor, we were using the tobasco and chalula sauce like crazy. This isn't the Hillside Spot I remember.   The only good thing? The coffee was great, the corn was awesome, and our waitress was a sweetheart.",

They had baked mussels one night as their local fish dish, and they were AMAZING!   I like to make a lot of my own food, so I really like it when I can find a place that you can tell used fresh ingredients. Definitely try the guacamole!  They also have  a few beers on tap, and live music I think once a week. Saturdays maybe? I haven't checked that out yet.  They also serve Cartel Coffee Lab roasted coffee so this is a great spot to stop off and get your caffeine fix.  4 stars because I have seen, and heard, a few things about bad service. It can at times, feel like things aren't running as smoothly or quickly as they should be. Nothing strong management couldn't correct.",

Although it was not crowded it took 45 minutes to be served and another 45 to get our checks.  We had questions about our bills and it took another 15 minutes before we saw our server again.  Everyone's meal was iffy. I had an omelet which was so overcooked that I had to put salsa on it to moisten it up.  I asked for two substitutions and was charged for added ingredients, $1.50 for avocado and onion instead of chorizo and red peppers. The server should have told me there would an additional charge even if it was a substitution. The huevos rancheros looked just as overcooked and dry.  Don't think I will return because of so many disappointing issues with service, food quality, and charges. They had very few options for a gluten free meal so I don't think it would be possible to avoid \"substitution\" surcharges. Their prices would be fine if the quality were better.",

I definitely give credit to our table runner... just as I asked where the knife and fork was, he immediately said he'd get it and other staff were unobstrusive about removing our plates later.  Since it's not restaurant style and leave a tip on the table, I think the higher prices are justifiable for their great service and pay their salary.   As for the food, it's ok.. nothing mindblowing.. the bread (MJ's?!) under the croque monsieur was excellent but the rest was meh.. ended up scraping off the bechamel and eating the bread alone.  Tunia fish is fresh and tasty, generous helping.  It's really the combo of the  atmosphere and friendly vibe that would have me come back if I'm in the Ahwahtukee area.",

It took nearly 45 min. to get our food from the time we were seated, during which we had no drink refills. I ordered a burger medium rare which came darn near well done and completely flavorless. My wife had a ribeye sandwich. The flavor of the steak was smothered by some overpowering sweet, salty sauce or marinade which completely ruined it. My friend had macaroni and cheese and it was pretty similar to Kraft White Cheddar Mac and Cheese, but with far less flavor.   The only reason this place gets two stars is because of the bread that the sandwiches were served on was really good and the guacamole appetizer was a 4 out of 5.  I will not be going back.",

    "text": "I lived in walking distance of this place for two years and it sat empty. I finally move and a great place opens up...WTH? I am very happy that Ahwatukee is finally getting a few places that are up to my urban girl standards (Hillside Spot and Pomegranate). I was waiting like a kid on Christmas day for this place to open. One Sunday while at the Farmers Market I passed by and it was jammed packed. Not what I was looking for on a quite Sunday morning. I stopped by again during the week and they were closed. Talk about disappointed. I did snag a menu and it looked rather promising.  A few weeks go by and I stop in for lunch. The place is crowded but not crazy crowded. I go up to the counter and order and they give you a little number for your table or they call your name, I can't remember. I grabbed my drink at the self service area. I got a great ice tea. This is coming from a complete tea snob. I waited a few minutes and out came my tuna sandwich. To my surprise the bread was toasted. OK so I am about to go on a bit of a tangent here...TEXTURE, TEXTURE, TEXTURE. I hate tuna sandwiches on soft bread. It feels like a pile of mush in your mouth. Totally yucky in my book. But this sandwich was on toast...YEAH someone got the texture memo. However, the tuna was bland, with a bit more seasoning this could be an awesome sammie.  My next encounter was a few days ago. Just finished hiking South Mtn and decided to stop in with a friend. We were not starving but wanted a little something. I was told for dinner they have table service. OK I am standing at the register like it is lunch time. Maybe they should have a sign up for that. No biggie. The dinner menu was very small. I found myself looking at the lunch menu wishing some of the selections were available for dinner. We decide to split the Derby Salad and french fries. We wait what seems like forever and our fries come out by a runner. She says the salad would be out shortly. Well the salad took forever and a day. We were almost finished with the fries by the time the salad came out.   The kitchen is open so I could hear the cooks having some issues with my salad. It appeared that one of the ingredients was missing (bacon) but they located some and fried it up. It was a nice touch to the salad. But as long as I waited I could have done without it. The fries were fresh cut and just the right amount of seasoning. On my way out I spotted the biggest slice of red velvet cake in the cooler. OMG a little bit of the South started to come out. If you lived in the South you know what I mean. Red velvet cake is one of my favorites. I asked about the price and it was a very inexpensive $4.50. Wow what a steal. But today is not cheat day so I have to wait.   The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is cool.  However, a bit dark inside at night. This place has great potential. A definite need for this neighborhood. I think the menu might have to get tweaked and maybe the kitchen staff could be better prepared. As time goes on I am sure they will work out the kinks. All in all I don't think you would be disappointed.",

I have to say I did enjoy the breakfasts (pancakes once and farmers omelet the second) The food was very good, but the wait and the service were big strikes. I totally understand the wait for breakfast on a Sunday morning...it is a busy place with folks going to the farmers market nearby. First time we waited 20 minutes. The second time we waited almost 30. We had said we would take inside or outside, but for some reason the hostess heard only the 'outside.'  When we went for early dinner, the place was pretty deserted. We ordered a beer (they have Kiltlifter on tap, which is our fav) and then we waited and waited. After 15 minutes the beer came, and before we could say we wanted to order the server dashed away. We waited another 5 minutes or so, he came back and we ordered the cheeseburgers...medium. 20 minutes later they came out...so well done they were practically dry. Big disappointment. The server we had never came back, didn't ask if we wanted another beer, etc. so when we were through we went up to the hostess and asked for our check. So silly when there were only 3 tables seated this whole time and no one on the patio (too hot) One server should be able to deal with 3 tables!!  All three times I went, I felt that the service was below par and the attitude being kinda 'who cares, I'll get around to it when I can.' And no one smiles at this place.  Darn, I really wanted this to be a local hang-out place for us.",

I could use a non-Starbucks coffee place in my neighborhood.  Turns out destiny had something even better in mind.  I had lunch at Hillside this very afternoon. After pondering the options (not many), I decided on the pulled pork sandwich, which comes with their own special coleslaw - not on the side, but on the sandwich.  I don't like coleslaw. I do not like it on a plane. I will not eat it on a train. I would not touch it in rural Spain. Coleslaw is not my thing in the sense that burning off my own eyebrows is\"not my thing\".  But somehow the cashier talked me into trying it. And I am SO glad I did, because the sandwich was excellent. I washed it down with a bottle of Mexican Coke (the good stuff) and considered it an excellent lunch. I may just have to rethink my stance on coleslaw.  The restaurant is clean, well-lit, and just about perfect for a weekend breakfast or lunch. The tables aren't too crowded or too far apart, and it has a nice contemporary feel. I am definitely going back.",

They use high quality ingredients and source from local vendors, which, for me, is a big selling point.  For breakfast I would recommend the croque madame, farmer's omelette, or if you are looking for something sweet, their pancakes are some of the best I have had.  For lunch/dinner I feel that it is pretty much mandatory to order the guacamole as a starter. Basically all of their salads are great, but the real stand out is the Spot Chop. The meat for their burgers is ground in house and they cut their own fries, so you can't go wrong there. I have also been known to order the vegetable torta a time or two.   They also have a great Mexican food menu, which I have only ordered from once, but that one order happened to be one of the best Carne Asada burritos I have ever tasted.",

From start to finish we were there for well over an hour and a half, most of the time just waiting. It was awful. The staff acted like we were a bother to them.

If you want a drink refilled you should order 2 drinks because it will take forever for someone to come back to your table.

Hillside is like the Swiss Army Knife of restaurants as they seem to offer a little bit of it all.  Good for small to medium size groups or individuals.  The atmosphere is the offspring of a restaurant, coffee spot, and bar after a drunken night of debauchery and no one knows who the parents are.  This place is definitely worth a second or third look during different times as the atmosphere seems like it changes throughout the day.  Like a mood ring, I suspect the color of Hillside will change depending on the patron.  So give Hillside a try, and see if this one size fits all fits you.",

    "text": "Ok Hillside Spot, you had this coming for awhile. I have been here at least 15 times probably because it's the only place around that is not a chain and makes somewhat healthy/gourmet type food. That being said I always leave somewhat disappointed with the hope that next time could possibly be better. I have dined here for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with and without kids. The biggest thing I notice is the service is always horrible, just always. The food comes out very very slowly. The servers look like they have much more important things to be doing besides serving and are very dull and bland in personality and enthusiasm for the place. They just don't care. Once the server forgot my coffee the whole time and since he never came back until he dropped the check, I had to get a free coffee card for next time. On that, the coffee is good, but how can you really go wrong with Cartel?  Ok as for the chefs, why do they always forget stuff that should come with my food? There is no value here at all, it is very overpriced. The Tunisian salad I had was $9.58 with tax. the salad is just veggies and olives. They forgot my kale. $3, $4, and $5 more to add chx, shrimp or steak. The salad probably costs $1 to make unfortunately I feel cheated. It's not large, I am a 117 lbs girl so that is saying something if I feel the portions are too small. It was good though, I must admit but not even worth the price. The food is hit or miss. I like the grilled (elote) corn, the cheeseburger is pretty damn good, the bbq pork was good, guacamole is good. Levain and lox is amazing. croque madame is bland, vegetable torta not very good, tuna is boring, spot chop is ok....i cant remember what else I had right now.  All in all, please just step up your game, make sure those chefs are getting that food made right and timely and hire some servers who maybe give a damn. Think about the value of your food, run some promotions or something. BTW, I do like Gallo Blanco a lot, but again not a very good value.",

Tried the coffee cake too, and it was great - just the right amount of cherry flavor.  The only reason that the place didn't get five stars was the rather indifferent service rendered by the gentleman behind the counter.  When you are in a great mood and looking forward to a good meal, a stoic stone faced greeting kind of detracts from this a bit.  (sorry, just my thoughts on the matter).  That being said I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "Reasons to Heart: Breakfast All Day, Self-Serve Coffee, Modern Hip Decor, NYT, Cholula, Inter-generational Friendly  Reasons You May Dislike: BUTTER PARTY, Small Menu, Awkward Market, Bizarre Combo of Self-Serve/Service that is NOT Apparent, Kid Friendly  Reasons to Be Here: Your friends you lost to baby-making Suburbs, IKEA, You are Near the I-10 and Do Not Feel like Sushi, Ace Hardware, You want B-fest after 10:30am on a Weekday, Dad Wants Burger, you Want Organic Local yogurt/parfait  First time here with my friend's parents, as we walked up, I noticed an antique wooden bench with multiple kinds of newspapers, including NYT, held down by an old iron and an Open sign with neon on a skateboard. Whoa. What a liberal hip person coding of an entrance if I ever saw one! Inside, a bright modern airy space with concrete floors, exposed ceiling beams, bright green walls and exposed stainless steel industrial kitchen, I was super impressed by the brightness the huge windows gave the place as well as the cutting edge furniture. The menus are charming chalkboard options that have breakfast all day, kid's menu and lunch served after 11am. All priced between $4-$11, alas there are vegetarian options but this is NOT a butter free place. In fact, it is a fucking BUTTER PARTY. So get your LacTaid if you can do it!  The slightly hipster staff (the guys look like that dude who played Keats in Bright Star) are amiable at the counter but after ordering my garden veggie sammie I was dismayed to realize they had pastry cases hidden in the counter (you just basically look up the whole time then realize after swiping your debit card your other options). Also the drink menu is awkwardly displayed to the far right of the main menus (um, I would've wanted a soy latte instead of coffee...). After paying at the register, there is the bizarre scramble of figuring out what you have to get yourself.  There is a large bevy cooler that has wine, beer, soda, juice, water, etc and was a very healthy selection (not a poor one at all). Awkwardly placed is the water, iced tea and coffee station where people are trying to read the menu before ordering. Most tables are four person tables with two people seating around the windows and large community tables towards the L-shaped back, along with bar/counter seating that views the cooks station. Each time I went I ended up at the same four-person table near the condiment table stocked w/catsup, Sriracha, Cholula hot sauce (oh shit).   My first experience I got ginger beer and a veggie sandwich. Now, as a vegetarian for over 12 years, and a lactose-intolerant for over 5 years, my expectations were way low. Instead, I was fucking IMPRESSED. The bread ended up soggy due to the herbs mayonaisse cream dill sauce thing with incredible local roasted veggies with really good bread. OMFG. I mean seriously, I can't remember much of the meal cause my brain went somewhere spiritual. I also got the fresh fruit on the side, and a great deal with fresh berries, grapes, kiwi, etc. I managed to fit it all in my tummy (and felt def. overstuffed-I should've kept 1/2 of it). My companions had the pulled pork sandwich and killed it, the other had pancakes.  Today, I woke up and I wanted breakfest. Not Essence, Gallo Blanco, Lux, Wildflower, def. NOT Harlows, I wanted fancy pants American style breakfast I hadn't had a billion times before. Located right off the I-10, it's a fast drive from Tempe, and I didn't know what to expect for a crowd around 10:30 on a Tuesday. Turns out, Tim and I were def. the median age here. Mostly older patrons, couples, families, business deals, co-workers, moms with toddlers (they have plenty of nice high-chairs, btw). I had to get the pancakes ($6) w/fruit ($1) and side of potatoes ($3) and coffee. Tim got the rotassarie chicken with grilled corn and hand cut french fries (I think under $10). Seating was easy, food came out together within 15 minutes. The pancakes were delicate, almost crepe like, with a buttermilk taste but not too cinnamony and a little dry and thin (in a good way-sops up the butter and syrup). The serving of fruit on top was a little small, but all good quality, the potatoes were home-made style with sauted onions, skins still on.  His plate was huge with a grilled corn, the fries still had the skin on, and the chicken looked great and very greasy (which he killed). We had to remember to get our own utensils, napkins, and our own drinks but the staff checked in periodically and after finishing our plates, the dirty dishes sat around for 5 minutes, I believe due to the insane lunch rush that came in! Seriously, the place exploded! I was happy Tim had bought the cookies he eyed earlier so we skidaddled after using the nice, clean bathrooms.   Now, eating yummers Blondie cookie and chocolate chip cookies that are greased through the paper bag, I think I will have to ride my bike here to justify the butter party celebration!",

I was only able to eat about 3 of my homemade fries due to how big the burger was.   The atmosphere was wonderful.  Cozy, yet a combination of business folks and ladies lunching etc.   All in all a great experience.  I will definate recommend in the future.",

It was egg whites only, with spinach, mushrooms, red bell peppers, and zuchinni. It was AWESOME!   I also got their latte so I could gauge the quality of their coffee. It was really good too! Kudos, they also have soy!   I can't wait to go here again, so take the following with a grain of salt. The downers? Well, there are SO many flies inside! I think they can open up their windows when it's nice out in the mornings, so that's probably where they all come from, but it's kind of obnoxious. Also, sometimes their service can be a little disconnected, however today I had two really good interactions with the staff.   Next time I'm going to try some of their salads or more breakfast items.   A suggestion to the management? Turkey burgers! The beef burger looks SO good, but some of us don't eat beef. Looking forward to it!",

On today's visit, the cute little lady that handles the seating didn't greet me when I approached. Strike number one. I said hello and she didn't say a word. I stood there and said HELLO and waited for her to say something to me. She said hello and how many and if my preferred inside or out... I told her 2 and either and my name. Then I waited and watched as many people left the restaurant who were tired of waiting. As I stood there for at least 30 mins, I was in bird's eye view of an empty table. Just a step to the left and I could see others that were outside and inside yet I was still waiting... EVERYTIME I make the choice to go to this restaurant, I have the same experience. I'm watching money walk out of the door. I think this place offers a good product, it has a great concept but they need a good front house manager that can keep the customers moving. It's good but SHOULD be great. I love the small business restaurants that have their crap in order. This one needs some help. :(",

I've been to Hillside Spot about half a dozen or more times and have been entertained, well fed, and treated like family.   Hillside has big chestnuts to open a place like this in a town that is used to ITALIAN ITALIAN and more ITALIAN restaurants. The only thing you might find Italian at Hillside is one of the chef's slicked back jet black hair style. I'm not even sure if that's Italian but it looks cool.   The best seat in the house is the mesquite locally made bar. It's has some serious wood. It's placed right in front of the open kitchen. You see everything from the chefs working their flavor magic to their bad ass rotisserie - it's awesome.   Do you want to know about the food? It's good! Their Modern American cuisine has a little flare (nothing that will scare off the Italian junkies), a lot of flavor, and fair prices. The ingredients are fresh and locally purchased.   Hats off to Hillside's staff, especially Christopher and I think she is the FOH manager (she has black hair and always smiling.) They have passion; they are courteous; and genuine. Clap clap clap!    Hillside if you read this - will you consider adding something special to your menu? A handmade seasonal milkshake. Mmmmmmmm. And wifi, please!",

The last few times I was here, I could barely get a seat.   That being said, it's so wonderful to have another locally-owned establishment in the neighborhood. Over the past few months, they've added a nice patio, though hopefully they'll find some umbrellas or it won't be any good in a few weeks! In addition to the restaurant, there's a small market area of candy/gourmet foods/cookware and some books/toys. The kitchen is wide open and it's interesting to watch the hustle and bustle while waiting in line.  I've only been here for breakfast and coffee so far. If it's busy, i've decided my plan is to pick up a coffee and a Cheddar Bacon scone.. wow, my mouth waters just thinking about these. They are just the right ratio of cheddar and bacon while still being buttery and crumbly.   The two egg breakfast is good but not outstanding. I felt like some potatoes or fruit would really add to the meal. On my most recent visit I had the Croque Monsieur, a combination of ham, gruyere, and bechamel over toast, with an egg on top. My meal came with a tiny serving of strawberries and blueberries. The quantity was just right and the taste delicious, although I think the bread was a little over-toasted. (I had trouble cutting into it with the knife provided.)   I plan on coming back for lunch or maybe dinner soon, and hopefully it won't be as busy. I'm happy to see they are doing well given how the economy has changed, but I don't enjoy fighting crowds for a meal. Fortunately, the delicious food and use of local ingredients well outweighs that issue.",

It gives high quality, organic places like Joe's Farm Grill and Liberty Market a serious run for their money.  The first time we tried Hillside Spot, they had just been featured in the AZ Republic.  When we arrived, they were turning people away - they couldn't handle the volume.  Each additional time that I have been for breakfast (always on a Sat or Sun) it has been crowded, but not mobbed.  We usually wait about 5 minutes for a table.  The food is amazing.  Large portions of good, high quality food.  I love the Croque Monsieur - a thick slab of frilled french bread slathered with bechamel sauce and topped with thin-sliced grilled ham, melted Gruyere cheese, and an egg (the egg is optional, and is added at no charge).  My wife had the huevos rancheros.  The salsa verde was fantastic and the potatoes were great, but I found that dish to be a little boring.  The pancakes look fantastic and the coffee is really, really good.  They use an open kitchen design so that you can see the food prep, and every single dish looks incredible.  I have not been here for lunch, but the burgers look excellent.  I am in love with this place, but am going to give it a 4 just because its still rather chaotic in here.  I was confused about how to get my drinks, the waitresses run around yelling out your name as they deliver the food that you ordered from the register, and it is often just a bit overwhelming.  On the other hand, this is only because the place is so good, and people are starting to figure it out.  I am SO glad that a place like this exists in Ahwatukee.",

We stopped in for a late breakfast on a Saturday morning and only had about a 5 minute wait. It's not a very big dining area and we ended up sharing a large table with another party of two (a couple chairs separating us).  I decided on the \"build your own omelette\" option which had plenty of ingredients to choose from. They definitely don't short side you on the portions either; my omelette was stuffed. My friend got banana pancakes (a la jack johnson) which were also outstanding.   It's a great local concept and features ingredients from local farmers as well as microbrew 6-packs for purchase. Awesome atmosphere, friendly service, and great food. Highly recommend Hillside to all my fellow yelpers.",

Although crowded, the noise level was pleasant and it was bright and airy. I ordered the half sandwich half salad, which was tasty but not super filling. Maybe I would have had a different experience of I'd ordered meat. My partner ordered the daily special which was a brisket sandwich and a side of coleslaw. He said it was good and seemed satisfied. The place cleared out a bit while we ate, so we stayed to read, study and use the decent Wi-Fi. All in all it was a pleasant experience, and I'd definitely return, especially for the patio seating.",

I love the items they serve but the taste is off,  the omelette are dry and over cooked, if you order a English muffin you get 1/2 and it's not even toasted.  It's sad because we are so limited in ahwatukee on decent places to eat.  The concept is great and they stay in business not because it's good food and good service it's more because we don't have any options.  The place is dirty as well.  I wish the owner would go drive out to liberty market (Gilbet)and see what they are doing out there and bring it here. It's worth driving to Gilbert over coming to hillside.",

We showed up with 6 people and a dog. We had all hiked 7 miles and the people and dog were just tired and hungry. After we sat down on the patio, we were questioned about the dog who is owned by a veteran. We joked saying we could just call him a service dog, but our group is not lone to take advantage. The hostess left, and in comes the manager tell us that the dog had to go and there was a seat outside the patio area for three. (Literally 6 feet from the table we were at. Our group was split with no effort to at least more us close enough to have a conversation even though there is plenty of room. We accepted it, we were quiet. In comes a woman with a small dog and the same interaction occurs, but this time, the manager accepts that the dog will sit on her lap on the patio. double standard? Absolutely, especially since the dog was not in her lap. Rude, inconsistent and fair food at best. Our waitress however was very accommodating and  tried to make the best out a blatantly disrespectful situation. Enforce or don't enforced",

The crepe with honey and nutella is a must try; it just goes together. The third star goes to the service. They were quick, nice, and unique.

    "text": "I have tried to hold off on giving a review like this, but the Hillside Spot makes great food and has consistently the worst service I have ever been given.  Two days ago, my friend and I sat down, and were greeted fairly quickly by our waiter, he took our drink orders, quickly came back with what we had ordered, and then left us there for 10 minutes while he tinkered around the bar area, and conversed with his colleagues.  It wasn't until we left the patio and got in our cars until anyone had even recognized we were leaving (or maybe they forgot we were even out there, idk), we left enough money to pay for our drinks and peaced out.    Two months ago, I was there with a friend of mine, and her father.  At the end of our meal he requested some coffee (which is something MANY people drink after dinner), and the waiter informed us that they weren't serving coffee anymore because he had already turned the coffee pot off.  (Keep in mind, the restaurant was open for another hour, AND there is a full espresso bar there)  My friend's father asked if he would really in truly prefer having a customer go to the gas station across the street for coffee, and the terse response he got was, \"You can go anywhere you want for coffee, you are just not getting it here.\"  The only reasoning I could have had at the time was that it was because my friend's father is South African, and they just don't like dealing with tourists, but after the other night, it's official, THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST SERVICE EVER.  These people need to understand who gives them a job, whether or not the company as a whole is treating their staff like crap, and they're all disgruntled, i'm not sure, but they were definitely not overworked either time that I went in recently and received terrible service.  Their Flaco Torta is great, but that's why I gave them two stars.",

It's local, the vibe is awesome, I never feel rushed, the menu offers a nice variety and everything I've tried is really good.  Breakfast all day rocks!  Beers, wines, mimosas are clearly well-stocked by someone who knows what they are doing and loves to please. Table Service from Michael is pitch perfect. Why 3 stars?  It's the coffee!  Java is just as important as the alcoholic menu and the unique satisfying food menu, the vibe and the staff.  Still, I drive right on past at times because disappointment creeps in. Hillside promotes itself as having a coffee bar. It does not. No barista, no espresso machine that I can see although they serve a fair latte. I'm visualizing a push-button single-serve automated machine that might have been tucked away in a auto repair shop. I've talked to the manager several times (he won't engage in a short conversation) trying to encourage him to take a step up to some fresh decaf coffee beans, a decent coffee grinder, and a visible espresso machine.  Let's see a real in-house coffee bar, please.  People will pay in cash, loyalty, and yelp stars!",

    "text": "I've come to the realization that a favorite place doesn't have to be perfectly spot-on, 100% of the time.  I think sometimes our expectations become a little unrealistic.  I've had mixed feelings about this place over the years, but when I consider what's offered at Hillside, especially during the times of the year when the patio is an option, I have to say it's a pretty good place.  Service is sometimes hit or miss.  Things ordered from the menu aren't always consistent, something you can really only notice over a span of time and fairly regular patronage.  But, frequenting a place also reveals trends over a longer span of time, and again I would say that Hillside is more consistently good than consistently poor.  And it seems lately, at least from my experiences, things like service and the consistency of menu items are improving.  I would say Hillside is overall a good place to go.  You do run the chance of an off day, but that seems to be becoming a thing of the past.  Beer selection, which has also been inconsistent in the past seems to have an overall improved offering as well, and Hillside should be applauded for their regular offerings of local craft beers on tap and in the cooler.  I would recommend Hillside again, especially during the months of nice weather when it's possible to bike up to the patio or walk the dog up.  But I would warn against the dark table in the back corner of the indoor seating space.  If you've never been here before, that seat could leave you with the wrong impression.  Hillside Spot is a neighborhood spot for me, so I am grateful to see the place continually improve.",

Cheese crisp was delicious, guacamole was amazing, they charged us for salsa that we didnt order. It just came on the plate so that was weird but its .50 so whatever. We had a variety of things, croque monsieur was great. I also had a corn on the cob and a side salad which I added the corn to the severely plain salad. Literally just spring mix. No carrot cucumber or tomato to be seen. Dressing was great though. Lots of burgers and homemade fries. Everyone enjoyed their food. Nephew had chicken and mac n cheese. Loved it. Uncle had teriyaki wings and veggies. Everyone really enjoyed it. Only 2 things I can say, the chips were stale and the iced tea was bad. Like, yesterday's tea. Instead of offering to make a fresh batch,  she just brought us something else weather it was water, coke or whatever. But overall nice experience.",

I don't know exactly what their secret is, but their food is ALWAYS the best.  I have a sneaky suspicion that is wood grilled meats, or maybe just a secret spice in their marinade/rubs.    From breakfast to tacos or pasta they are number one! Hillside is one of the BEST restaurants in the valley.",

I got the pancakes and hashbrowns and my boyfriend got the Gallo burrito. They were both very good, and the pancakes were thin but still fluffy! My mom got the chile chilaquiles which is normally my go to but it was made a little different than the traditional ways so it was more like a tostada with eggs on top instead of cut up fried tortillas and eggs and chile mixed together like I would have been expecting. She said it was still good though! The only thing I will say is that their coffee is strong, they only do double shots and although it was good I probably would've opted for a single shot mocha instead. Overall it was a really positive experience, we'll definitely be returning.",

I am so conflicted on how to review this restaurant because they ended up correcting all the wrongs however, it was a horrible first impression. We checked in and agreed to the 25 minute wait. Mistake number 1. We sat down and looked for a drink menu or Sunday Bloody Mary special couldn't find one. We asked the server for a cocktail list and it was beer/wine only. However, I later in the breakfast saw servers walk around with a watermelon mimosa I didn't see on the list or let be known to me. Mistake number 2. We ordered children's pancakes, hievos ranchos, a breakfast torta and an egg sandwich for later in the day when I feel like nibbling. Only received 2 out of 3 meals. Mistake number 3. Yes, our server comped the children's pancakes but  the pancakes weren't the issue.  We were impressed by other reviews but we most likely won't return for Sunday brunch.",

Since everyday can be a cheat day, I ordered a banana/Nutella crescent and split it with the rest of our party. It was absolutely delicious.  A slam dunk. I was told the huevos rancheros was as delicious as before. The El Jefe omelette was ok. I have had a lot of omelettes and this one was a little flat, full of ingredients, but a little crispy.  The added jalapenos gave it the right amount of heat and the subbed in bacon gave it a healthy crunch.    On a side note, our server Christen was very attentive but a little snooty.",

The hipster staff could be excellent, but they need much better management. An employee told us that it was \"seat yourself\" so the three of us found a table in the center of the restaurant. We sat there for 20-30 minutes and no one stopped by our table. We finally had to flag a random server down.  They really shouldn't have a \"seat yourself\" policy if they can't keep an eye on things.  We met here because Hillside is one of the few places open early.  The chilaquiles were nice and crunchy. The green chili flavor was great. The croque madam was also well made. The bacon was pretty basic. The hashbrowns were only slightly crispy, but I'm glad they were overly greasy. I love the look and design of the restaurant. The bar is cute. The selection of local and craft beers is awesome.   This could be an excellent restaurant, but they need to re-train everyone.",

It was slow service but decent food, although smallish portions. We thought, \"this place is new, and there are some wrinkles that it needs to iron out\". It slowly got worse and worse. We have eaten here about 20 times. I keep saying never again will I bother with this place, but somehow I keep giving it \"one last chance\".  Well, this week was it's last chance.  I must tell you right up front, that we are very nice, non-complaining people.   We stood to get a table for over 15 minutes.  Servers kept going by and looking at us but we were NEVER even acknowledged.  I was starting to think we were invisible.  FINALLY I went up to someone, and asked if we should just take a table. They said no.  The food takes FOREVER, which would not be a problem if it was worth it.  We will never give this place another chance.  Way to expensive for what you get, and the time it takes to get it to you.  I just love the atmosphere, and am very sad that the place never improved, but actually got so much worse!      OWNERS of this place, you need to read these reviews, train your staff better, do something about the extremely  slow service...  This could be a great place to spend a morning/afternoon/evening, but sadly it is not.",

    "text": "You'd think, wouldn't you, that with a name like Hillside Spot this restaurant in Ahwatukee would be nestled in a pastoral setting with lovely views? Not so, it's in a typical strip mall off Warner Rd. and unfortunately its patio faces directly on the street, making it hard to carry on a conversation, even on a Sunday. The patio, without misters, is uninviting, with a very odd mixture of seat cushions for the wrought iron furniture. It was even more off-putting because most of the tables were loaded with dirty dishes. There was one hard working busboy who couldn't keep up with the mess. It wasn't much better indoors - messy and noisy (the noise of the cars being replaced by very loud music).       You place your order at the counter. Breakfast is served daily from 6:30 AM to 4 PM. There are pancakes, plain or with apple compote ($6) or with bananas, caramel, creme fraiche and peanuts ($7).  Eggs, scrambled or fried, come with MJ toast and a choice of bacon, ham, sausage, or chorizo ($6).  Various egg sandwiches and omelets range from $6 to $8. But we had come for lunch. The selection was small, and not particularly inspiring. Tuna or chicken salad sandwiches ($7), turkey ($6), a BLT to which you could add a fried egg at no extra charge ($7) and a croque monsieur ($7.50). Surprisingly, none of these came with a side. The cheeseburger ($8.50) came with fries.       I ordered the rotisserie half chicken ($10) which was served with fries and seasonal local vegetables. Of course, I requested crispy fries. Ken opted for the Derby Salad, with various greens, egg, avocado, bacon, and blue cheese, served with house made buttermilk dressing ($8). We waited quite a while, when finally a server, shouting our name and number, delivered our food. The salad was good size, with loads of blue cheese chunks of good quality (rather than the generic crumbles served at many places), and large pieces of bacon. The greens were fresh and the avocado looked freshly cubed. It's a shame that the buttermilk dressing was tasteless, and the quantity skimpy. My chicken was nicely cooked, with crisp skin - much crispier, in fact, than my fries which were dark brown, but limp. The vegetables were a mix of roasted cauliflowerets, corn, and red peppers which I enjoyed.  We took home a brownie and a slice of chocolate cake. Both were excellent.       All in all, although our food was generally good, I had expected more. More ambience, a nicer setting, a more interesting menu. One of the owners of Hillside Spot also owns Gallo Blanco, a Southwestern/Mexican restaurant (our favorite) in the Clarendon Hotel in downtown Phoenix,. That menu, while small, is full of interesting, flavorful food. The place is clean, the decor \"bus station\" funky. It is, however, LOUD, especially when the Flamenco dancers are in attendance. Unfortunately, the limp fries are there too. So, while we will continue to eat at Gallo Blanco, Hillside Spot is off limits for us.",

No matter the time of day, the music is loud, too loud really to have a normal conversation. When getting my cup for coffee I had to ask for a clean cup, mine was covered in lip stick.

    "text": "Based on a review in PHX Magazine, I decided to stop by Hillside Spot for breakfast today.  Not a good choice.   I ordered Mia's Pancakes, a blackberry muffin, and regular coffee.  The muffin was good, but not spectacular.  The coffee was bad - it tasted metallic and \"off\" for lack of a better word.  Then my pancakes arrived...they were large, but not tasty.  The pancakes were too eggy, soggy, and SALTY!  It was bizarre.  I ate three bites and then left.   I don't know if I was there on a bad day, but it was terrible and I was very surprised since it received good reviews.",

    "text": "I love that the Hillside Spot is in my neighborhood because we need more places like this, but I think they are just now working through the problems of opening a new place in a \"cool-restaurant\" starved area.  My first visit was a little weird.  It was crowded and there was no clear understanding of how it worked (no table service at breakfast).  We had just hiked S. Mtn and it was pouring rain.  The line was out the door.  People were pissy and rushed - even the diners.  The room was cold, but you could tell the open architecture would awesome if it wasn't so loud, cold and frantic that morning.  Normally I don't mind the loud, fast more urban breakfast atmosphere but people were fighting over tables and the food deliverers were hard to track down.  Anyway, my farmer's omlette was grossly greasy (egg whites with awesome local veggies lying in a puddle of oil) and the toast wasn't really toast but rather a grease-smeared thin slice of bread thrown on the grill.  I heard from people next to us that I should have had the pancakes or even the bacon & egg scone.   Next time...  I decided to give them another chance the next week when I took a group of friends there for dinner.  WE LOVED IT.  The pace was slower.  Our waiter was helpful and sweet.  We were in high spirits with our glasses of wine and girl talk.  The hamburgers, french fries, rotisserie chicken, salads were all fantastic.  I will definately go again.  I'm already craving the hamburger and that's really not my style.  Must be good.",

The place has a lot of potential, good menu and ambiance, but the execution is poor.  I hope they go out of business soon so someone can open up something better at that location.",

We went on a Sunday morning, knew there would be a crowd but the wait in line wasn't long and we had a table right off.  The entire line stopped while the order taker bagged up the to go portion of my order, my friends pie to go ordered at the same time took over an hour to get to the table. What was that? the food is good the portions large. They can't afford to get a number system for the tables? A wait person stood behind the drinks station/bar bellowing my name. not even stepping around. I had to stand up and holler  because I COULD NOT FIND THE PERSON WHO HAD MY FOOD. The food was nice but living in the east valley I wouldn't drive cross town to eat here again.",

I found the experience to be pretty much in line with reviews, that is - inconsistency is the problem here. On walking in, its a nice open layout concept - the hipsters on yelp tend to call it quaint or cute, while everyone else seems to say hipster. I wasn't really welcomed, but the girl stared at me as I walked up to the host stand and I said \"for one\" and she asked if I wanted bar or table. The server was sort of quick, then the manager took my order. I probably looked obnoxious reading the yelp reviews but lone diner, give me a break. Food was good, not that anyone asked, got one refill (which I requested), sort of wanted dessert but I was left alone despite being at the POS so I just put out my card and left. I think the best thing for this place is to go in with medium expectations and hope to be pleasantly surprised. They definitely think that being local may do better than some 101 on service. My salad - the Thai salad special- wasn't what I was looking for when I walked in, but delicious. Oh and they forgot to put some regulars order next to me. This is the second or third time I've been here, the other times being awhile ago - long wait, inconsistent food (my meal sucked previously), or really good meal? Maybe they hit like 30% success rate.",

    "text": "Came in for a business lunch with a party of 3.  The hostess attempted to sit us at a long community table.  We politely asked to sit at another table and she obliged but had a sour attitude about it.    After she seated us she hastily made a comment about trying to balance out the waitresses tables without even making eye contact.  We replied we are trying to have a private lunch thanks.      The waitress came out and promptly got our drinks.  We ordered and the food came out shortly.  I had the 50/50 pulled pork and Brooklyn chop.    The pork sandwich was served on a fresh soft bun that was perfect.  It also had a great flavor and tasted very fresh.  Fortunately it was so good as it was 90% of the sandwich.  The meat inside was so tiny it was basically all bun.  I am talking the meat portion was equivalent to two dill pickles in size.    The meat and toppings were so lacking it quickly became dry and hard to eat.  Without any condiments other than hot sauce I began to pour it on just to get the bread down.  The salad was really good.  Fresh, crisp, and very tasty.  The ice cream cookie dessert was also excellent.    The same hostess awkwardly said bye to us while purposely looking away.  No hard feelings.  Probably won't be back after this first visit but if this place could work on their hostess game and serve proper proportions of meat to bun ratio it could potentially be a 4-5 star spot.  Best of luck!",

    "text": "Father's Day 2019. What can I say, I never expect perfect service during a holiday. I always look for a few things in a experience.  1) service of staff: what can I say. The manager was kind of a Dick Head. Well I can't say \"Kind of\" he was a dick. So my experience was this. I called ahead of time and asked what is the wait. The response was 20-25 min wait. I walked in and gave my name and I said well I can wait in my car for ten minutes. The manager starred at me with the look of someone looking for crank and they will do any for it. He stated you have to wait here or if I call ur name and you are not here I will seat the next person. I stated \"oh I thought you said the wait was 20-25 mins. He said ,\" well that was the max time. I asked, well what is the min time? He said well 5 minutes. I said oooookkkay. I will get my family. I grabbed my family and came inside. 28 minutes later my name was called. So the manager was a DICK.!  2 ) My family ordered food and the waitress was pleasant, I ordered a burger with egg and a side of jalapeno slices and coffee. I got the burger, no coffee or jalapeno slices. So I let it go. The waitress was nice about it and offered coffee to go however I declined.  3) The food: The food was good and that is the reason why I keep on coming back.   I will keep on coming back for the burgers and fries. The manager can keep on hating because I'm a cheerful dude.  This is my second review of hill spot",

We were seated immediately and it the temp + noise level was just right.    Our party consisted of people who were vegan, vegetarians, pescatarians, paleo and see/eat anything diets!  All of us were SO happy with our food. I had a grilled cheese + a cup os posole (which both are some of the best dishes I've had in a restaurant in a long time!) Taking care of us tonight was Katya.  She was superb. We wanted for nothing and she was very personable.   I don't live near Ahwatukee anymore - but I highly encourage you to visit Hillside Spot whenever you have the opportunity!  They serve breakfast (all day!) along with lunch and dinner. They have an amazing/large menu.  There's a board when you come in that lists the daily soups/specials.   I saw someone come in with a service dog, and they brought it a stainless steel bowl of ice water!  Made me feel really happy...and missing Ahwatukee.",

This review is for breakfast items served at night since there is no wrong time to eat pancakes.   Some of my breakfast favorites: Pancakes - fluffy and delicious!  Hash browns - real potatoes served crispy in a hash. There is a popular breakfast place (not naming names, but it starts with S and ends with nooze) that serves hash browns that are soft and moist. Not at the Hillside. Here you get real crispy hash browns.  Bacon - cooked to order, crispy and delicious.  Sausage - flavorful and delicious  Levain bread - I have a family member who bakes bread. Their levain tastes home baked - it's complex, flavorful, and textured perfectly.   Whomever runs the place cares about service - I've been many times and never had poor service.",

We went for brunch and split the croque monsieur and flaco torta. I loved the torta sandwich--the chorizo was spicy and I loved the slices of avocado. The open face sandwich was good as well, but my gf kept wanting another bite of my sandwich! I had a great iced coffee drink as well.

Three stars is a good rating, and that's what Hillside Spot is, consistently good.    The interior design reminds me of Liberty Market, which is a good thing, I find it inviting and friendly, it feels comfortable, though there is nothing particularly special about it.    As for the food, like the interior, it kind of reminds me of Liberty Market, which again is good. The gallo guacamole is made to order and has a nice sweetness to it and I like it topped with the cotija cheese, the croque monsieur is like a guilty pleasure, it is a rich and very tasty sandwich with beschamel sauce and a fried egg on top. My favorite dish however is the baked chicken cacciatore. Please order it. I don't even want to write about it, I'll get all flustered. Hillside also has a good beer selection.    I used \"good\" a lot in this review because that's the best way to explain it. I certainly think everyone should try it out, I think you'll like it, but don't expect anything grand, go expecting a good meal, and know you're supporting a local business, always a terrific thing to do.",

During the week, it's a terrific spot to grab a late breakfast, coffee, and even get a some work done on wi-fi.  You can order at the counter and they are pretty quick with bringing out your drinks & food.  Have ordered the granola, croque madam, oatmeal and a variety of espresso drinks, and all have been tasty.  Weekends, however, are a different story.  They are usually understaffed with servers (who are hard to pick out from patrons since there is no dress code to distinguish), and waiting 30 minutes just for a table to have a simple breakfast is not cool.  They don't have counter service on the weekends so you are at the mercy of waiting to be seated, and then waiting longer for order taking & food.  Been there a couple times for dinner, also very good, with the exception of getting old versions of the menu which have items they don't make anymore.  Loved their fresh halibut.  It doesn't seem that there is ever a \"manager\" there on weekends who could make sure the place runs well.",

It has fantastic lattes, way better than Starbucks, and the food is delicious too. However, the prices here are way too high for the amount of food/drink you get, and the service can occasionally be slow, depending on how busy it is. They do not handle busy times well, although they are much better than they used to be. The most disappointing thing about this place is that they no longer allow dogs in their nice side patio, so after my hike with my dog, I have to sit near the front door which downgrades my experience a bit. I still go here frequently despite all of the above as it really is a decent place for breakfast. Btw the mimosas are to die for!",

We've been going there infrequently for about 14 months, mostly because I like good coffee. Finally after the fourth bad service experience I've decided to look elsewhere. Two cups of coffee were luke warm by the time they reached us and the slice of cheesecake to share came so much later we had nearly finished our coffee. Two things perplex me. Firstly, there were only 3 other tables with customers at the time (mid-afternoon on a weekday so not exactly buzzing with customers) and secondly, having cleared our own table of previous customer's plates (moved to an adjacent table), the waitress ignored those dirty plates along with others on tables nearby, which was bizzare since she walked past them 4 times. Finally, we had to go looking for the waitress to get the check since she never once checked in with us to see if we had everything we needed. I'm so terribly disappointed.",

As long as it is packed it won't change and it could be great. The service is almost non existent. Be prepared to wait for everything, starting with a hostess the minute you walk in. The last time I ate there I had to go get silver wear and a menu myself. The menu tries hard but doesn't quite make the mark and the prices are high. Finally, beware of the ever changing beer prices in the cooler near the entrance. Signs clearly mark that beers are 6 for $8.95, but some employees charge more for certain beers even though that are not marked as such. After spending my Father's Day morning trying to make a special six pack for my husband and getting denied even though signs are everywhere and they had not pulled these shenanigans for the same beers before, I will not be returning. The McDonalds in the parking lot would be better food and service.",

So the following weekend, we return and order pancakes with fruit compote (apples) an spinach omelette and coffee. We received our omelette right away, but had to wait at least 30 minutes for syrup because they ran out.  Because we had to wait so long, they brought us a fresh order of pancakes once they got more syrup.    Hmmmm...I don't know about you but if you serve pancakes, shouldn't you always have syrup??  Oh well it was still delicious.  But that did not keep us away as they gave us a card for 2 free breakast or lunch for the inconvenience so we returned.    We went back for lunch this time and we both ordered the pork sandwiches....OH YUMMY! Mmmmm-Good! I must return for another one of those!  Did I mention the coffee is delicious?!

I ordered the mesquite grilled chicken which came with two sides - I chose mac n cheese and stir fried veggies. First of all, they charge $4.75 for a side MAC N CHEESE out of a BLUE BOX, which should be a freaking crime. That is the kind of crap you find on a chain restaurant kids' menu... YUCK! Making a decent mac n cheese from scratch is not that hard, guys. The veggies were complete mush - nothing you would expect when you read \"stir fried veggies\". Last, there was the chicken. Sigh. There was some sort of goo that they slather on it - it is sticky sweet - and it condenses down as it cooks, then sticks to your teeth when you eat it. Oh yeah, the chicken was very, very pink close to the bone.   Maybe this is more of a breakfast place? Perhaps I just got unlucky and had three terrible things on the menu? In any event, it will be difficult for me to try this place again.  I still can't believe they serve Kraft mac n cheese and charge $4.75 for a side of it. Laughable.",

There was plenty of open tables when we got there, but we were still had to wait 10-15 minutes to get seated. The hostess explained to us that the cooks were 'catching up' on the orders and that's why we had to wait. When I asked if she could just seat us and take our order 10-15 min later, she looked completely confused and said, \"uh...I...don't know...I was told not to seat anybody\". So there was a bunch of other people just standing there, waiting, and you could see they getting frustrated by this too.  We finally go seated and the waitress got our order, she was nice, but took a long time to come back after she took our drink order. We waited at least 20 minutes to get our food. When the food finally arrived, we were not impressed at all! My husband got the El Jefe Omelet, it looked soooo good on the menu, but he was very disappointed. We paid $8.50 for a below average omelet with 1 slice of toast. They charge extra for sides like home potatoes...most restaurant places we go to include the toast and potatoes with your meal, especially when you pay that much! So yeah, their prices are not the best, especially for the quality and quantity of food. I got the El Gallo Torta, and it was OK. We also paid $3 for 1 egg and a slide of toast for our son, and never got a refill on our coffee. This place has potential, I like their concept, but they need A LOT of improvement if they want to keep customers coming back. I know we won't be back after our disappointing experience.",

If you want fast and cheap, go to  McD's across the parking lot. The food here is better than anything else in Ahwatukee.  I don't mind waiting and the servers are relaxed and friendly.   Don't change a thing!  If the people who don't like it here stop coming, more great food and atmosphere for the rest of us.",

The rest of the staff seemed busy palnning and enjoying sitting at the counter while I watched two customers walk in and out without being welcomed..let alone served. If you don't know to go to the counter and order your going to wander around since everybody seems to busy doing who knows what to give EXCELLENT customer service. Look folks, I don't care how good your food or fancy your place is...if you don't meet and greet and provide first class customer service..you ain't gonna be around long. And don't let any other successful restaurants I hear you have mean your a lock at this place. The food was ok...but watching the staff ignore customers is inexcusable. I sure hope you get off your high horses and start welcoming everyone that walks thru the door and ask \"is this your first time here\" Then give them the drill......trust me, you ain't to big or too important to fail. I'll give this place one more try........you need to warm up the sterile atmosphere....you could learn a lot from Liberty market which seems to be the concept your emulating.",

The food was excellent and the service was friendly without being intrusive.  Love the little details like the recycled wine bottles for glasses and the Queen Creek Olive Oil.  Get the grazers - the bread, the cheeses, and the homemade pesto were all awesome!  Love this unpretentious, yummy, and sexy new hangout!   See Nathan at the bar - he rocks!

    "text": "I'm pretty ticked off at hillside right now.  First, the only reason it is not a 1 star is because I have been there enough times during the day and was pleased with the food, however, my wife and I tried their dinner service the other night and it was just horrible.  The server was nice and on point but the food was pathetic.  The \"Gallo\" guac was brown and tasteless and the half the chips were burnt.  I've had that several times at the Phoenix restaurant and it is amazing so I was excited for my wife to try it... huge disappointment.  Then the salad that is amazing at gallo every single time was garbage.  It was 95% cabbage, 2 very small pieces of kale, not enough dressing and very bland.  Lastly, the fries were soggy...ahhhh..I seriously hate that, so we sent those back and they brought out another batch exactly the same.  When we spoke to the manager, instead of apologizing right off the bat, he was combative and immediately started to explain to us that they use the same recipes as during the day.... hello, anybody can use the same recipe and screw it up if you are using bad avacados... just another hint on that, splash it with a little more lime juice and it might...might have been acceptable, but I doubt it.  Then he started to explain away the fries and how they were having a problem with the frier, so why make it worse and bring me out another bad batch?  Anyway, we were so mad by the end of our dinner and we conversed with another couple that also just got done berating the manager on their way out the door.  It was seriously horrible.",

From the huffy attitude when we asked to be moved from where we were initially seated, to the cold and salty food, to the unaccommodating management attitude--this place has all the wrong stuff.  Ordered a breakfast entree and it showed up with essentially liquid, stone-cold eggs as well as cold chile sauce and room-temp chicken. Sent it back only to receive an order with tortillas so heated that they were burned and the allegedly over-easy eggs done rock-solid all the way through. And again the chile sauce was nearly cold, the chicken room temp and in short supply. I was so hungry that I consumed the nastiness only to find that halfway through, everything was already cold.  Now for the best (worst) part.  On receiving the check, the server explained that the entree would be \"comped.\" Well then, al least the management has a conscience, right? Wait. When I inspected the bill, I find TWO charges for my entree. They had actually charged me for both the entree I sent back and then one I ate, and then removed the charge for only one of the entrees. When I brought this to the server's attention, she consulted management, who removed half of the charge for the duplicate entree with the admonishment that this was \"the best that we can do.\"  We're done for good with this mediocre-at-best establishment. The best that we can do is never return.",

If you enjoy breakfast, head to Hillside Spot for some awesome crepes or pancakes. If it's lunch time, I highly recommend the BBQ burger, literally one of the best burgers I've ever had. For a lighter version, substitute a smoked chicken breast filet for the burger patty and have a side of fresh fruit.   Absolutely delicious iced tea options! Awesome chips and salsa as well! Service is friendly, although sometimes a bit slow.  This place gets busy a lot. There is a reason for it.  Hillside Spot doesn't have the cleanest feel in the world, the restroom was messy and not stocked well.    Visit this place for an awesome lunch! If the weather is nice, ask to sit on the patio to avoid getting the smoker smell all over your clothes. You will not be disappointed in this place!",

    "text": "I have been going here for along time and I really loved it until Saturday.  My boyfriend and I went in about 130pm.  I had my service dog with me.   I went up to the hostess stand and waited.  The hostess was standing right in front of me ignoring me.  About 5 minutes later the manager comes over and tells me that I have to sit outside, it was raining at the time.  I replied this is my service dog so i would like to be sat inside.  He told me to go sit down because I would have to wait for an open table, even though there was plenty of tables.  We proceeded to wait 20 minutes until they called my name.  They walked us all the way back to the corner to seat us.   The hostess handed us our menu and walked away.  My dog had gone under the table and was asleep, where she was suppose to be.  Our waiter walked over and proceeded to tell me that I had to produce a service certificate for my dog.  I told him that I am not required by federal law to give him one. He then decided that he was going to yell at me in the middle of the restaurant telling me that the health department requires him to get a certificate (which is a lie, I talked to the health department) and that he is being nice allowing me to stay and eat.  He then yells \"I bet its because you cant give me one thanks for helping out you community\" and storms off.  The manager, if you can even call him that, was standing by the counter staring at this whole thing and does nothing.   I have never been treated with such disrespect in a restaurant.  The owner of this place should be ashamed for having such rude and condescending people working for him.  People who have disabilities shouldnt have to be verbally harassed when they want to get a bite to eat.",

I've been to this restaurant to eat maybe 4-5 times and each time is absolutely terrible. I've stopped going ever since they screwed up my order the last time. It's like the servers don't speak English or something. You can tell them day in and day out, \"I can't eat dairy, mayo, or butter\" and they still shlop mayo and butter all over your dish. I remember ordering a pulled pork and they smeared mayo all over the bun. I mean, who even wants mayo on their pulled pork?? That's just disgusting, I'm sorry. Anyway, after countless times of trying to tell them how I want my food, trying to notify managers, even emailing the customer service email on their website (and got no response), I gave up!

I made the trip Sunday and was sorely disappointed in everything except the service, which is the only reason this review is a 2 star and not just 1.   I ordered a burger and asked that it be cooked medium. Easy, right? Well, no. After quite a long wait (about 30 minutes, but it was quite busy, so that wasn't such a big deal to me), I got a well done, over cooked burger that was burned around the edges. My first thought was how in the world could such a horrible burger make it out of the kitchen? The chef should never have let that food leave the kitchen. The server should have been told the kitchen screwed up and then fix it. But no, that didn't happen.  Our server, Alexa, got right on the replacement. A manager came by and I tried to help him understand that the burger I got should never have made it out of the kitchen. Rather than take responsibility, he offered excuses about how busy they were.   When Alexa brought my replacement, the burger was almost rare. It was as if the kitchen was making a point...take the burger as we give it to you or you'll get it raw. It was done enough around the edges for me to nibble, but I didn't eat much of the burger. Thankfully, Alexa took the burger off our bill (but I did leave her a generous tip since she was the saving grace in this experience).  I don't know what's going on in the kitchen, but shame on the chef and the kitchen staff for not being able to deliver a burger cooked to medium perfection. I'd had burgers there before and I remembered loving the burger! But my experience yesterday showed a complete failure in both the kitchen AND management. It's as if the customer's experience didn't matter at all to the kitchen and didn't matter much to the manager.   Oh, and the omelet my friend ordered...well, I'd have sent that back too. It was dry and looked horrible to me. The omelet was supposed to have had goat cheese on it, but she could only find one little chunk of goat cheese on it. The mushrooms from my mushroom swiss burger helped make her omelet more appealing. This was her first experience at the Hillside Spot. Quite frankly, I was embarrassed at the whole experience....I took a friend to what I thought was a great restaurant, only to have a horrid experience. If y'all ever get your kitchen back in working order, feel free to reach out...maybe I'll try you again. But for now, given all the other recent bad reviews, I'll spend my money elsewhere.",

I've had a couple occasions where it is SO bad that I've asked them to box up the food and took it home. They are located right next to an Ace Hardware so how hard can it be to get some fly strips to keep them away from your patrons and food. Or get the darn place fumigated. It's because of this that whenever someone recommends the Hillside that I cringe on what kind of experience will it be this time. Sitting in here right now and already getting depressed as we are being nagged by flies as were awaiting our table.",

I would like to continue enjoying the dining experience at Hillside, so I want to offer some simple suggestions.  When tables are bused make sure they get wiped down and silverware  and napkins are restocked.  When the food runner brings out the order make sure to read the ticket so you know that the order is complete.  Pay attention to small details like bring the correct bill to the table and notice when water glasses need to be refilled.  Have the staff work together as a team so everyone will notice dishes that need to picked up, empty or missing silverware containers, and making sure that outside areas are free of items left behind by the local birds.  You have great food please pay attention to the small details that make a business great.",

    "text": "Very disappointed with their breakfast food. We came in on a Saturday morning and it was pretty busy. Started by ordering drinks - they don't carry any decaf coffee! For a breakfast joint not to offer an option of decaf coffee is pretty unheard of. For those of us who can't have caffeine or don't want to have caffeine, you will not be getting a cup of jo with your breakfast. My husband's cappuccino was good, but we've had better.   Now, onto the actual food. I ordered Farmer's omelet and my husband ordered El Jefe omelet. Farmer's was completely unseasoned to the point where it tasted so bland I would call it inedible. I called our waitress back and asked if they forgot to season it. She told me that we don't actually salt our food very much. I wasn't specifically talking about salt, but seasoning in general. I reiterated that there is zero seasoning in my food and it tastes very bland, and she offered me salsa in return. Salsa helped, but then all I could taste was the salsa.  After it was all done I walked away very unsatisfied with my food.  El Jefe was better, but again, not something to write home about. The toast that it came with was also pretty bland. Overall I think they are going for minimal clean ingredients, but ultimately failed at it because they served us food that tastes bad. Healthy food doesn't have to taste bland.",

First visit I had decided to try the CHILAQUILES VERDES which had layers of corn tortillas with mesquite cooked chicken, Oaxaca cheese, spicy green salsa (not too spicy for a wimp like me) & 2 sunny-side up eggs (which I requested scrambled). IT WAS HEAVEN WITH EACH BITE! My date had and loved the PULLED PORK SANDWICH which had the special recipe braised pork, slow cooked on our mesquite fired rotisserie, served on toasted telera bread and topped with their homemade, spicy cole slaw. UN-REAL! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! It was so yummy, from the taste or two I was given.   Second time we went was for breakfast. I had the \"El Gallo\" Torta with scrambled Eggs, chorizo, tomato & avocado and  mayo served on La Sonorense Telera bread. The chorizo was just spicy enough which I liked. The only thing that would have made the meal perfect was if the torta bread had been toasted (minor, I know). I also ordered a side of hashbrows which were seasoned to perfection and nice and crispy.  A new favorite place for sure! Can't wait to go back and order the pulled pork sandwich for myself!",

She didn't come to our table until it was time to pay, we asked for the check and she was no where to be found so we walked to front register and paid. We were driving back home so I ran back on to use the bathroom, Before I walked out she appeared in front of me and said \"was something wrong?\" And I was so confused and I said \"I'm sorry, I don't think I understand\" and she said I front of bunch of customers \"you didn't leave me a tip!, where my tip\".. OMG I couldn't not believe her I have worked as a waitress before so I couldn't not believe that just happened to me. I was so embarrassed and I looked at her and I just walked away and she still yelled \"hey!\" As I left.. Never again will I go back there and I hope she learns some manners. I always tile for good service how was I suppose to tip a person that was completely MIA.",

We particularly enjoyed the coffee; not sure what coffee they use but it's absolutely delicious, especially the capuccinos and mocha's. They also serve it in these nice mugs, which just adds to the experience. I highly recommend it! However, the staff tended not to be too experienced in making their coffee so there were often some variations in size of the coffees, milk used, whether or not they added whipped cream etc. I recommend that the cafe managers to capitalize on their delicious coffee by training each waiter to make a consistent coffee and by asking the same questions consistently (does the customer want whole milk, skim milk, etc.?) and by advertising it as one of the cafe's strengths. Again, I haven't had coffee this good in quite a while.",

    "text": "I was so looking forward to breakfast here. What a disappointment.  The food is the only thing that rates any stars at all. Good ingredients cannot be completely ruined by incompetent service.  The space is nice, but crowded and loud. The counter staff were indifferent. After being waved over to an open register, the fellow behind the counter took one order, then wandered off, leaving the rest of us to get back in line at the other register to order.  You are given a number (or not) and left to find your own table, scrounge up your own silverware, and wait for your food to be delivered. Except that the napkins are at a completely different station than the silver, they were out of forks, and most of the tables were completely filthy. I watched a busboy randomly swipe the top of a table, sweeping crumbs onto the benches and chairs, then leave an empty drink bottle on the table before wandering listlessly off.  Beverages are (apparently) serve yourself, although they didn't bother to say that when I ordered. I stood at the counter, waiting for iced tea, only to turn around and see that I was expected to get it myself.  If they happen to \"run out of numbers\", then they input your name with your order. Nothing irritates me more than to have my name shouted across a restaurant. Better yet, the waiters wander from table to table looking for their customers.... \"Lisa? Is there a Lisa here?\" while your food cools. Inexcusable.  The only bright point: the croque madame was tasty. Delicious bread, ham, and a perfectly fried egg. But the meager smear of bechamel and a thin slice of cheese were underwhelming. However, the \"side of fruit\" made me angry: a tiny metal creamer with 1 blackberry, a few slices of strawberry, and 2 chunks of  green apple. Insulting.  Fast casual, order at the counter works well when tables are clean and set, and the food delivery is speedy and efficient. Unfortunately this place needs some work in order to make it worth your time.",

I have been a regular for a year and a half so you'd think someone would notice me, say hi like they recognize me or do anything to make me feel like they appreciate all my business. Unfortunately, NO!! I honestly feel like a new patron every single time I go here. Never once has anyone said one word to me like \"good to see you again\" or \"how are the kids\"...it's a major fail for a local business not to do this really simple thing. So, please, if you read this (and based on their track record, I'm assuming they don't monitor any social networks) can you train your staff to be warm and welcoming to match the decor. While I like this place, I will be coming here much less due to the poor customer service.",

(We should have left then) There were crumbs on the ground, the restrooms were dirty and at one point, one of the waitresses dropped a knife, kicked it out if the way but NEVER bothered to pick it up.  When we finally ordered it took another 20 minutes to get our appetizers then 20 more to get our meals. While we waited for our food, we saw the girl at the table next to us get a cup of coffee with complimentary lipstick stains on the rim.  That's just gross!  The food was simply not worth the wait.  Small portions left the family disappointed and hungry for more... but not from there.  We will not be returning any time soon.   Save yourself the time & disappointment. ... go somewhere else.

    "text": "I love summer.  Not because we become nocturnal and have to hibernate during the day.  I love summer because I get to drink iced coffee.  Up until a few months ago, all I knew was that I loved iced coffee, didn't really think about who had the best . . . until I had Hillside's iced coffee!!!  How do they do it?  How can it be so delicious?  I never noticed being impressed at other places and now nothing seems to compare to Hillside's.  I have been back three times just for the iced coffee and to see if it was a one time thing, but it was not.  Each time the iced coffee (with just a hint of milk, no sugar) has blown me away!  And the cherry on top?  Cheddar Bacon scones!  Yep, I said it!  I have never really been interested in scones before and have always claimed to have more of a savory tooth than a sweet tooth.  Blueberry, cherry, eh.  When it came to take it or leave it, I always left it.  Today, I had to take it!  This morning, I saw the delicious Cheddar Bacon scones in the case and had to have one.  I was not disappointed.  Light and fluffy, chunks of bacon, yet each bite was nicely balanced and not over powered by either cheddar or bacon.  Oh Hillside Spot, I heart you!  Update 8/2:  I finally have an answer to my question \"How do they do it?  How can it be so delicious?\"  The answer is they get their coffee from the Cartel Coffee Lab.  Who knew!?  We do . . . now.  Check it out. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/cartel-coffee-lab-phoenix#hrid:w6hrU_1NGdkAGEM2B_ot1w\">yelp.com/biz/cartel-coff...</a>",

    "text": "Major letdown! I guess I should have listened to the Yelp reviews, but instead I listened to two word-of-mouth referrals. Came in around 8:00am on a Saturday morning and the restaurant was relatively quiet. My husband and I were seated within a few minutes so that was a plus. We ordered two iced white mochas to drink... big mistake! It look nearly 25 minutes to get our coffees.... they were actually delivered at the same time as our food! Besides the coffee being delivered ridiculously late, it tasted terrible! There was definitely nothing white or mocha about it and it had a horrible bitter after taste. Drank a few sips and left the rest. Now for the food... another disappointment! We were told that Hillside Spot was the place to go in Ahwatukee for chilaquiles... wow were we misinformed. Their version of chilaquiles is two corn tostadas with meat in the middle, bland, watery, green \"salsa\" pored over the top, and two eggs on the side..... Umm.... That is in no way chilaquiles. We also tried their house pancakes... yet again another letdown. Absolutely nothing special about them and they left a strange bitter aftertaste in your mouth as if too much baking powder was used. Syrup had no flavor and tasted watered down. Over all not impressed with this place which is a major shame because my husband and I like to support local small businesses. They only thing that earned them two stars was their vast selection of beers. They do have a very impressive beer list, however, I do not think we will be returning. What a shame.",

    "text": "My husband and I frequent Hillside.  We started off just going for breakfast (great breakfast burritos, by the way!) and then decided to try out their dinners.  Their food is awesome!  I've liked just about everything I've tried, with the exception being the fish tacos, and even those weren't bad, just mediocre.    Our favorites there are the guacamole as an appetizer, the carne asada torta (My husband raves about this one.), the chicken sandwich, and the salads.  Their fries are amazing, especially if you ask for a side of their homemade ranch.  My complaint with Hillside is the service.  On a few occasions, we've gotten waiters that aren't particularly friendly and forget to check in on us to see if we need anything.  And during peak times, they sometimes have dropped the ball and forgotten to bring out appetizers or drinks.  That being said, we look past the occasionally lackluster service and still dine their frequently.  The food keeps us going back.  Oh, and try the chocolate chip cookies!  Also... they have half-price bottles of wine on Wednesdays, ribs on Thursdays and craft beer night is also that night.",

    "text": "Hillside definitely hits the Spot!   There aren't too many great options for breakfast/lunch near my office at South Mountain, so I was thrilled to find that I really enjoy this place. I've gotten sandwiches to-go every time I've been here. I wish I've had the opportunity to sit down and eat here. Hillside is pretty sparse in terms of decor, but the restaurant has a very clean feel, and I love the open kitchen. There's always whole rotisserie chicken spinning over their grill. I've also seen whole tomatoes on the grill which gives the place a nice inviting smell throughout the restaurant.   They offer counter-service, and everyone who's ever helped me has been friendly. I've been offered coffee while I wait as well. My favorite sandwich is \"el gallo\" torta. In between the soft bread is avocado, chorizo mixed into the scrambled egg, tomato, and a bit of mayo. It is seriously what gets me out of bed some mornings. I also love that they use local ingredients and partner with local vendors. Their menu is also reasonably priced.   If it wasn't for the long drive back home, I'd like to give this happy hour a shot. They've got a pretty interesting wine selection I'd like to try, but I'm not sure how well that would go with my breakfast sandwich, or boss.",

I only gave it 4 stars because I went back a few days later and the food was less stellar.  But still good. I will try to go back during lunch.  The burger looked amazing!",

You get plenty of delicious, crispy bacon for the price.  The atmosphere is pretty good, but the clientele can be kind of annoying which is no fault of the establishment.  I go there for the food.  The bar stools are uncomfortable, and the service is inconsistent.  Some of the servers are fantastic, others mediocre--so depending on who you get the service can vary from great to not very good.  However, the food has been consistently very, very good.  In addition to the bacon, the omelets, breakfast burritos, burgers, sandwiches, and chorizo are all delicous.  The coffee is hit or miss though.  The bottom line is I don't know of a better place to have breakfast in Ahwatukee.",

Basically everything food related is great.  The problem, as many have noted, is in Hillside's service. I've had a number of servers who have been very good, so it's not a systemic issue.   But, that being said, there are a number of servers who are about as bad as it gets. They won't come to take your order until you've been there almost 15 minutes. They drop the food off and you'll never see them again unless you flag them down and almost yell to them. These folks aren't unfriendly, but they're also not exactly caring about your experience.  So, you're left with the feelings that I have: hope that Yelp gets the management weeds out the poor servers, so this place can be the 5 stars it should be.",

Those experiences that comprise the 90% include breakfasts, lunches, and dinners.  Amazing pancakes, best bacon in the valley (seriously, big props for the bacon), huevos rancheros yum, chilaquiles to die for, awesome burgers, great beer selection, and I am in love the Cocina 10 items!  The servers are friendly, knowledgeable about the menu (both food and beverage), and make the overall experience at Hillside enjoyable.  The other 10% - the bad - have occurred in the mornings on the weekends when they're in the middle of a rush.  New rule - if I have to wait more than 5 mins for a table at Hillside I have to walk away.  They just don't seem to properly staff those peak times and both service and food quality suffer.  Final words... outside of 8:30am-10:30am on Saturday and Sunday I will continue to visit Hillside for any meal of the day.  Great food!  If you haven't been... go!",

    "text": "We were heading to Chandler, and decided to stop here for a late lunch.  Hubby had read about it, and thought it would be perfect for us.  It wasn't really busy, since we arrived around 3:30ish on a Friday afternoon.  We got a nice table, and had a very friendly waitress come right over to us.  We wanted some guacamole and chips to start off, but I don't like jalapenos (which are in the guac), and she said they make it fresh, so they can leave those out.  As soon as I heard that, I knew I was going to enjoy this meal.  Hubby decided to also get himself a bowl of clam chowder (which he has to try wherever we go).  The guac was incredibly creamy and delicious, and the chips tasted freshly made, as well.  Hubby's chowder was gigantic!  He truly didn't expect that much, but he loved it, and finished every last drop.  For our main courses, hubby got the fish & chips and I ordered the tuna melt.  I realized what a picky eater I was, when I mentioned that I didn't like the outside of the bread to be buttered (I hate the greasiness when it's made that way).  Our waitress told me they don't use butter on the bread, it's put in the press without it.  Awesome!!!    Hubby's fish & chips were really tasty and crunchy.  He loved the batter, and it came with a chipotle dip instead of tartar sauce, which he also seemed to really like.  The fries were handcut and quite tasty...not overly salted.  My tuna melt was served on \"lavain\" bread (I think that's what it was...sort of a mix between sourdough and seedless rye), which had a really nice flavor.  The tuna was quite good and had a few golden raisins in it.  They added a nice burst of sweetness every now and then.  Everything was delicious, and the wait staff was quite friendly.  We both enjoyed our meal, and would definitely come back whenever we're in the area.",

Clean the patio up There is so much junk at the back of the patio that it looks like bulk pick up is late picking up.  Not so bad if there weren't tables directly next to these items.    2. Get rid of the flies At the time of this report there are 7 flies sitting on our table alone.  There so comfortable on this patio that they are too lazy to fly around- they live here.  It is a constant problem and again highlights that the patio is unacceptably dirty.  Again, clean it up.  3. Change your menu even slightly. The food is good and there is potential. Would be nice to add variety.  Although I cannot recommend hillside spot secondary to the above reasons, I hope that they can do these necessary improvements to survive.",

    "text": "Not sure where to begin but I'll start with the atmosphere. The restaurant has a cool, local pub vibe to it that if you're a regular you can certainly enjoy.  The food (I've only have breakfast there) is average. The turkey omelette I had wasn't bad and the bacon was decent.  The problem is with the ever present flies. It's literally flies, flies and more flies. You'll spend the majority of your time swatting away flies as you try to eat.  The staff seem used to it but as a person trying to eat, it's a real nuisance. The first two times I went I thought maybe the flies just happen to get in, but this is a common occurrence.  When you realize that the same flies that are around dumpsters are the same flies landing on your food, you tend to lose your appetite.  This is a direct reflection of the cleanliness and that's something I can't overlook.  Eat at your own risk....",

It looks like the eggs were cooked flat and just chopped up with the edge of the spatula. The hashbrowns were hard as a rock.  If you don't care at all about how your food is cooked then I suppose you might like it here.  They need to get a real cook, not some clown Who just says they can cook.  And they need servers who will refuse to bring food to the table that isn't correct.  This place has been here for many years but I don't know if the ownership has changed or watt. I expect this to be the next place to go out of business in our area. And I hope it is replaced by ownership who knows what they're doing and cares about their business.",

She said the pancakes were tasty, covered in a drizzle, bananas, and candied peanuts. She also said the pancakes without the toppings would have been pretty plain. The service was fast and friendly however no check back on the food until we finished. Would have been a 5 star however the hashbrowns were incredibly, almost inedibldy salty as well as our eggs were both overcooked and brown on the bottom (I ordered over easy she had over medium).   On a different note they have a marketplace to by the beers that they serve in house and a build your own six pack option which is pretty neat.",

They have a great indoor space with a market as well as a nice outdoor patio. The staff has always been overly helpful, nice and prompt. I have been to this place twice and ordered the same exact thing because it is THAT good. It's a very laid back place and I love the versatility of it. Great for studying, meeting up with a business client, hanging with a friend or even for a larger social crowd. The food is excellent!! Check them out if you are in this area.",

My food was not too good. I got the breakfast burrito with chorizo. Very little egg, too much chorizo which got old fast and the \"potatoes\" inside it were leftover french fries!!!  OMG - talk about a lazy substitution and a misdirection from the menu description. The tortilla my burrito was made with was also not great tasting and in the end, I literally just ate the insides of the burrito and left the entire tortilla on the plate. I also got a side order of a pancake with apple compote. This was recommendation from my pretty but poor excuse of a server. The pancake on its own had NO flavor. The apple 'compote' was a couple of flavorless, weird colored apples with the skin still on!  If it wasn't for the syrup, there would be no flavor to this $5 extra item.  In all, I paid a pretty penny and was left very disappointed.    My server was also a disappointment. She spent most of her time chatting with 2 girlfriends at the bar/pub area, letting my food sit for a bit. I could see all this and she didn't seem fazed. Then when she took my order, she never wrote it down and originally my burrito had to be remade because of her inaccurate placement of my order.  The server never asked me how my food was, didn't seem to notice I did not eat the tortilla portion at all. Didn't seem to care.  This was my first impression, first time at this restaurant.  It seemed to be a find when I first viewed the menu. Not your typical chain, some different types of food, but the execution of the food and the lackluster service made this a no go in the future.",

I inhale my food when I sit down at your tables.  I smell, I observe, I look, I simply fall in love at first bite and then I do this thing with my fork, my mouth and the plate until the plate is clean.    Your coffee is that of the coffee gods, my blood veins literally come alive at first sip, only to have my body leave comatose some time later!    Hillside Spot, why on earth did I ever try your pancakes...  Why did I try letting you \"Hit the Spot\", whoa there Yelper....  that's Hit the Spot pancakes.  I DON'T eat carbs.  What's wrong with you serving me those?  The sugar, the whipped butter, the syrup, the pancakes, the bananas, the caramel, the everything you put on any of your pancakes.  I've tried them all and I'm just not sure I can stop eating those pancakes and it scares me.  The warm soft cushy pancake smeared with the butter that has been drowned in syrupy goodness.  The way I insanely start from the middle and eat the pancake from the inside out, leaving the rim on the pancake.  Its all so sinful... Sinfully good that is.  Thank the breakfast gods for your omelettes, I can redeem myself and exhibit some self control when i have the farmer's omelette or the El Jefe, sans the potatoes with egg whites.  I even get tickled that you charge me 50 cents for the side of salsa with my omelette.     I'm still hopeful that one day, the service at my favorite breakfast place in Phoenix will improve and I can update this review with some fresh bling!  Until then, you're actually saving me some carbs, because I'd be back so much more often if the service were top notch.",

No exaggeration, we saw our server when she took our order, had a food runner drop off the food and no one else ever came by. Additionally, the food runner dropped a portion of my brother's meal and it was never replaced. We couldn't even request a replacement (which we shouldn't have to do) because, again... no service. I tried reaching out to Hillside Spot as instructed on their website and I never received a response. Terrible service and management that can't even be bothered to respond to customers.

I thought it was pretty tasty.   It was (kind of) later on a Tuesday night so it wasn't very crowded. I liked the lay-out though. We sat inside but the patio looked nice. Lots of wood furniture and a semi-open kitchen. I didn't feel like a drink (shocker!) but they have a pretty extensive beer selection. In fact, I believe they have THREE gluten-free options (I'm not gluten-free, but a friend I often go to HH is, and I know gf beer options are often scarce).  The menu is kind of random, but I like it. They serve breakfast all day. Lots of tortas & egg options, but they pancakes and the like as well. They also have lots of salads, sandwiches & burgers. In addition, there's lots of Mexican (really I would say more like \"New Mexican\") meals as well. A lot of the breakfast menu has a \"New Mexican\" spin to it.   I had a veggie burrito that came with rice & beans. It was all very good. I liked it mainly because it was a good balance of being a hearty meal, that wasn't too heavy, but wasn't hoity toity either. This is how a lot of the food here seems to be. The kind of stuff that \"seems\" healthy (and some food can be), but really isn't (and that isn't a bad thing, I think). The veggies in the burrito were grilled nicely, and and had a lot of flavor. I also liked the fried rice it came with. Again, it wasn't too heavy, but still had flavor.   The prices here are reasonable for what you get. The service was so-so. Our waitress was friendly, but wasn't the most attentive.   Like I said, this isn't a part of town I ever come to, but I'd come back here if I ever find myself in this 'hood again.",

Every single time we have tried to eat here, there has been some issue from the food to the service. It's Saturday night at 7:00 pm and they have about 12 tables. Nello's across the parking lot is mobbed with patrons waiting outside. Umm, what's wrong with this picture?  Tonight, we came in and were seated right away but it took awhile for our server to get to us. She came and took our drink order then left again. She came back with the drinks and took our order. We ordered the Grazing Platter with 3 items. We were pretty disappointed with the quality of the meats and cheeses on the platter.  Our food came and the server dumped our plates down and didn't even bother to pick up the dishes and so forth from our appetizer. Then my husband looked at his Croque Madame. His over easy egg looked like rubber and was so overcooked it the yoke was solid. The sandwich was charred on the edges and pretty much inedible. We tried for 15 minutes to get someone's attention, including calling out \"excuse me\" and we were ignored. When we finally got her attention and my husband let her have it, he didn't ask her to take the food away because he was starving and had decided to make due. She took the food without asking, my husband having said he didn't want anything else. She left him with a tiny cup of berries. He refused to take half of my burger until I said I was full. Which I did on purpose so he had something to eat.   We saw her go talk to the manager, who incidentally was expediting and the one who let the food go out in the first place,  and heaven knows what was said, but he obviously didn't want to be bothered.   She finally came back - 10 minutes minutes later - and we asked for the check. She got no tip and a note on the bottom of the receipt.",

    "text": "Beyond disappointed. I've been coming here for quite sometime and the service has slowly gotten worse every time. My visit yesterday will be my last.   Arrived around 9:15 the place was busy but not packed. Took 15 minutes to get menus and over 30 minutes to get hot tea. I had to ask twice and when I had to ask a different waiter he seemed very bothered and I said \"I'm sorry but should it take over 30 minutes and asking twice to get my drink\" his response was \"I guess so\". Tea was delivered 2 minutes later with lukewarm water & no apology.   When my food arrived, I asked the server for tomatillo salsa as that's what I had ordered and they brought me fire roasted. The servers response was to argue, continually that it was tomatillo \"it's just not as green and that's all we have do you want it or not\" then behind her came our server with the tomatillo salsa, the other server who stood there and scolded me about how she knew their salsa turned and stormed off, no apology for the confusion.   My mom ordered the chorizo scrabble, the chorizo amount delivered could & did (we were curious) fit exactly on a tablespoon. Looks like they are running out?    I've really tried to support hillside as I love the atmosphere and going to local businesses but you guys seriously need to get it together and make some drastic changes! I can't tell you one person who I've taken there in the last year and has had a good experience. Your food quality is going down, your service is slow and the staff is beyond rude, consistently!   In reading your yelp reviews, your management should be seeing the trend. You don't respond to your customers and in person I have never once had a manager come out to fix the problem. This tells me that your staff is a direct reflection of the ownership.",

The service is always pretty friendly as well. They also have a great craft beer menu with a mix of local and non-local beers.  Definitely one of the best in Ahwatukee.",

We soon realized that we needed to start out our shopping on the other side of town so we did another search for breakfast and found this place.  What a great find.  We were seated right away and our server came to us within just a few minutes.  I must say that their coffee was awesome.  It didn't taste like that chain restaurant coffee that everyone is use to.  The inside is very eclectic.  A lot of different things going on but very cool.  The one thing that I thought was so cool and that I love, is the open kitchen.  I don't know why but I really like to watch people in a kitchen cook.  The bar had those old time stools that reminded me of the stools in my science class in high school.  My wife had something called....well I can't pronounce it and sure as hell cant remember how to spell it so let me describe it.  It was a thick piece of Levain bread with ham, cheese and an egg.  Very simple and very delicious.  I did the BYO omelet (chorizo, turkey, gruyere, spinach and jalapenos were my choices) and it was delicious.  This is a spot that we will definitely try to come back to.  See you guys next time.",

    "text": "Parking lot is somewhat challenging.  Spots are big enough to easily accomodate smaller vehicles, and now that ACE Hardware is gone it looks like there will be more spaces available.  Free reign to park bad.   There's one bistro set just to the East of the entrance where you can dine with your dog.  They have a patio here, but do not allow dogs on their patio.   Can someone explain the reason for this when Uncle Bears, just up the road will allow dogs on their patio. Alright, nevermind.  Okay, let's just go inside.  Trendy atmosphere.  Its casual, low key and set up nicely.  I like their industrial displays of drinks and other edibles.  Rustic boxes and metal crates accented with galvanized buckets filled with schtuff bring the comfort of memorbilia that doesn't overwhelm to the point of tacky. Clientele this early morning was primarily business meetings which soon turned over to neighborhood folks with kids, etc. as it got closer to 9 a.m. My oatmeal is average.  Just a tad soupy for me.  But it comes with brown sugar and raisins, and server brought cream at my request.  And no additional charge.  TYVM. My side of ham wasnt much more than what appeared to be a couple slices of deli ham.   My company had the pancakes with Apple compote.  The portion was equivalent to maybe a quarter of an Apple and looked more like sauteed than a compote. Taste of pancakes ranked as pretty good. Now the water. That's Phoenix city water - unfiltered, nastiness.  Strangely enough the server tells me they have a filter on one of the other water sources but what they give customers is not filtered. Now that's a way to encourage someone to order something other than water. Overall, fair seating area (but the chairs are small/short), food good, service good, water horrible.",

My two friends and I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, a tuna melt, and a soup.  Keep in mind, I NEVER send back food.  Tonight was the exception.  The soup was cold, so they brought us another one, which was fine. But both sandwiches were cold, and the cheese wasn't even melted.  The server apologized and said they would make us new sandwiches.  A few minutes later they brought out a new sandwich-- except it wasn't new! They were the same sandwiches they brought a few minutes earlier-- with our bite marks in them.  They put partially eaten food back on the grill.  Health code violation, maybe?? The server was very apologetic when we pointed it out, and although our sandwiches didn't taste bad, she said she would bring out new ones.  The tuna melt came out fine, but my grilled cheese with bacon and jalapeno was terrible!! It was mostly raw jalapeno with a little bit of cheese.  I took a few bites and gave up.  This-- coming from a girl who is almost always in the clean plate club!  The only redeeming factors tonight were are apologetic server and the bottle of wine we ordered.",

    "text": "5/27/10  After reading a couple of reviews on Hillside Spot, I decided to check it out myself.  Besides noticing that the line was still long, despite it being around 1030-1045 on a Thursday morning, I also noticed that this place gets NOISY!  I didn't care if it was full-on sun outdoors and already hot, I could not, and would not, bear the noise indoors :(, and apparently a few customers had the same idea, bec. the only available tables out there were lacking umbrellas.  [I'd give 4 or more stars if it wasn't so loud!!]  Don't fret, though, as I found one of the staff was willing to set up a table w/ an umbrella- all you have to do is ask!  I already checked the menu online for ideas, so I already knew what I might want to try.  Bec. of the crowd and the noise that greeted me on this first visit, which jarred me and had me scrambling for some space, I wasn't able to check out the display cases and counterspace w/ their array of pastries- cupcakes, apple pie by-the-slice, cookies, tarts, muffins, and scones, which vary daily.  Do check them out!  (The apple pie is so so good!)  The daily special sounded good, but I decided I'd try the Croque Madame (a Croque monsieur topped w/ a fried egg) and the Pancakes w/ Apple Compote.  Ordering is at the counter where you pay and take a card to mark your table w/.  It takes awhile for your food to be prepared, so keep this in mind when you do decide to visit.  I'd say this would be a good time to check out the pastries, but depending on how busy HS gets, you may want to place all of your order selections in the beginning and get it over w/.  The croque madame is simply outstanding!  Well, except for the burnt bits.  The French bread (from MJ Bread, I believe) was just perfect, topped w/ a fantastic bechamel sauce, sliced ham, melty gruyere cheese, and a fried egg!  This is definitely an item I would order again and again!  The pancakes were good (loved the batter mix!), but \"apple compote,\" this wasn't!  OK, I admit, the compotes I've had thus far were fruit reductions that were thick and sweetened from the natural juices, as well as added sugar, so perhaps Hillside Spot's \"apple compote\" technically qualifies as a compote (as defined by <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdictionary.com&s=e5ca71fd202348a76a5ddf65093f0d223eef84d0404c547ec933169b573a1d6c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">dictionary.com</a>- \"fruit stewed or cooked in a syrup\"), but I found the topping as neither sweet nor stewed enough (the chopped apples still had a lot of crunch in them!).  Thankfully, I had my bottle of pure maple syrup in my purse to sweeten the pancakes!  :)  7/24/10 I visited HS for a second time in early June and tried the berry pancakes w/ homemade whipped cream.  These were delightful!  I almost ate the whole thing, and had I not tried the apple pie, I definitely would've polished them off.  The added bananas (perfectly ripened) took this dish over-the-top!",

It used to be one of my go-to \"spots\" and I was very hyped up about the place. However, the quality of the food declined...badly. I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt and say, \"Well, maybe the last couple of times I was there they were just having 'off' days.\" But, it was those \"off\" days that don't really make me want to return. I hope they can turn it around, because Hillside showed so much promise early on.",

    "text": "Came in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and because it was my first time going I wasn't sure what I was planning to eat yet. The waitress who helped me was very energetic, smiling and was nice enough to answer all my questions about the menu. She suggested I try out their watermelon mimosa and it was definitely really good. Overall my experience was good there until it was time to pay. After she brought out my check and I handed her my card she brought back my receipt and after I was finished I had definitely left satisfied and happy that I had found a new place near me to come and hang out. Now the downside was later that day as I was getting home I realized I couldn't find the card I had used to pay with and so I decided to call them so they could check to see if by any chance I had left it there since I clearly remember she never brought it back. Now this is when my experience changed. As I call in a girl answered and I let her know I had been eating there earlier and that there was a possibility my card was never returned. She then tells me that she will transfer me to a manager and let me tell you this guy had the worst customer service and annoying voice to top it off. So as soon as I got transferred he doesn't even introduce himself or even asks me what he can help me with instead he asked for my name and the color of my card. After I give him the info he tries to say my name and has a hard time pronouncing my last name so then proceeds to say \"yea whatever it is\". At this point I'm getting upset so I tell him I'll be heading over since I thought it was strange they had kept it. As soon as I arrive some guy yelled over at me and asked if I was going to order something and after I told him what I was there for he says \"Oh right!\" In a rude tone and walks away. I'm then left standing there waiting for my card so I asked another guy who was heading to the cash register and before I could finish my sentence he hands me the card with a fake smile and just says \"YEAH\" in a high pitch sarcastic tone even after the fact that I'm still nice enough to say thank you. One thing I did find strange was the fact that I noticed there were other cards in the register besides just mine. It made me think if maybe I wasn't the only one that this had happened to and that's why the manager had asked for my name and card color. Either way though the way they handled this was very rude.   From all the places I've been to I've never had someone keep my card and to top it off act so rude and unprofessional. I understand accidents happen and she could've forgot to return it but they could've handled this more professionally and maybe even apologized for having to make me go back to pick up MY CARD that they shouldn't have kept in the first place. Because of their unprofessionalism I have unfortunately decided not to return especially knowing how the manager running the place handles things.",

    "text": "I love small business... so I'm always disappointed when I can't give a rave review. We went to Hillside Spot after a race (running) so we were starved. I went to the counter and ordered an OJ and pancakes. They took our order quickly and gave us a number for the table. It took about 15 minutes, but they brought us the plates of food... but no drinks. The employee said \"it's by the register.\" So, I went back inside, grabbed an OJ out of the cooler (wish the person taking our order would have mentioned that) and went back outside. As I sat down to eat my pancakes (again, I was starving), I noticed that there was no silverware. So, I went back inside and noticed it was on a separate table behind the cash registers.... again, I wish they would have mentioned that it wouldn't come out with the food. THEN, there was no syrup with the pancakes. So, I went back inside AGAIN and had to wait for someone to pour me syrup into a cup and they even got the syrup all over the outside of the cup, which I had to carry back outside. Finally, I was able to sit down and eat. The pancakes were good, but nothing to get super excited about. They definitely filled the void- just glad they weren't cold after I had to run back inside 3 times to get everything I needed.   Not impressed with the employees- they didn't do a single thing to go out of their way to make this an exceptional experience. If they would have told me about the OJ at the register and checked if we needed anything else when dropping off the food, I surely would have given this a better review. Hopefully they'll do better for future guests.",

I really love the croque monsieur, but change it up to a madam by putting a fried egg on top.  Ask for extra bechamel sauce, they can be a little stingy with the good stuff sometimes.  They serve Cartel coffee here which as any good Pheonician knows is the best in the valley if not the country.  Fresh orange juice is great.  I did stop by once for a burger - which was good with only one caveat - juicy burger on soft bread with no layer of mayo (as Alton Brown suggests) to keep the bun from becoming a squishy mess.  Good fries, fresh cut and fried.",

It looks like European bread, it is NOT.  Hillside needs to change bread distributors.  It could be as simple as \"La Brea\" or even \"Fresh and Easy's\" new bakery products.  It is tragic because I love everything Hillside has done; the windows the open kitchen the casual environment remind me of the greatest restaurants in town; La Grande Orange, True Food and The Vig.  I would eat here weekly if only they weren't compromising on the bread.  To the owners, I plead, get some gourmet breads, European style, herb breads, Sourdough, breads, Whole Grain with Nuts, even sprouted grain breads if you want to cater to the super healthy, but the croissant-looking, Roman Meal tasting bread should go.",

Great flavor but with a nice twist to it and the guacamole was very light, yet still substantial and had a kick of flavor to it (might've been pineapples in this, I can't remember).  Croque monsiuer was also melt-in-your-mouth good. Just very fresh fare overall.  Can't love the service, but go there when you have time to lounge, chat with some friends, and share some good food!",

    "text": "Just went there for breakfast. It was a complete disaster.   We waited in line for 5 minutes for the hostess to take our name and then waited 15 minutes after that to be seated. This was a little frustrating since we could see there were open tables.   Once we were sat on the patio, the waitress took our drink order and didn't come back to take our food order for about 15 minutes. She seemed annoyed and indifferent.  We waited FOREVER for our food. People around us were clearly as displeased as we were. The waitress never came over to refill our drinks or offer any explanation for the wait. It was almost as if she was avoiding us. We just sat and waited, getting more annoyed every minute. We watched as tables of customers sat with no food and the staff milled around, no pep in their step, no sense of urgency. They all seemed like they really could not care less about their jobs and their tips.   When we finally got our food it was nothing impressive. We basically got an $8 slice of bread with some ham and cheese on it. Nothing anyone couldn't make at home. Never got a refill on our drinks. Food was edible but I wouldn't call it \"good\".   The waitress explained, after I asked why it took so long that 3 people in the kitchen had walked out so that's why she was frustrated. SHE WAS FRUSTRATED? I couldn't believe she had the nerve to say that when she wasn't doing anything to make up for it. I would respect them if they looked like they were trying but they really weren't.   There was no sign of a manager or owner. It looked like a bunch of sloppy, apathetic kids with no guidance working there. If your kitchen staff walked out that's a clear indication of a problem.   It's too bad because the ambiance is cute and hip, and this area could really use a privately owned spot for breakfast, but all in all, I would say DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY on this poorly managed joint. We won't be back.",

It has a funky ambiance, friendly staff, beautiful patio, and great neighborhood location, however, I am often so disappointed.   I met friends for coffee last week.  We sat in the corner at a wide wooden table with chairs.  Our waitress quickly greeted us and was very friendly.  It was 8am so I was eager for coffee.  It was lukewarm, watered down, lacked flavor, and not good.    I am happy with Circle K coffee and Hillside's was just plain bad. If they could make a good cup of coffee and compete with Dunkin Donuts and all the chains that plague Ahwatukee it would be a public service!   As for the food, I opted for an eye-catching pastry.  I chose a blueberry muffin.  It was dry and cold.  My friend ordered a scone and was also disappointed. I have been here about 4 times since they have opened but have been rarely pleased.  Sad to say I don't think I will give it a try again soon. It's just too heartbreaking.  Please Hillside Spot! Step it up!",

I have had breakfast, lunch and dinner there countless numbers of times.  I have had meetings at Hillside and worked there for many hours at a time.  As well, I was part of a book club that met there weekly for quite a while (and we all ate meals).Yesterday, I was meeting with colleagues to have breakfast and work on a grant.   Three of us who all ate breakfast.  We were asked by Omar (manager or owner, not sure which) to NOT stay there an work because of the breakfast rush!  I AM APPALLED!!!!  My husband, 2 sons and I have spent easily several hundred dollars (if not thousands) there and eaten MANY MANY meals there since Hillside opened.  In fact this past week, I was there 3 times and ate meals on all three occasions.  To be told to not stay to work has me so angered and disillusioned that I will not be going back there!  I have become friends with several of the staff there and will greatly miss them...but I have been left to feel so unwelcomed by Omar and the management there!  (In fact, as I was leaving yesterday, I stood by the door to see if Omar would come and apologize to me...he looked at me: smiled and nodded and said nothing.  To say that I am disillusioned is an understatement!!!   I can be reached at <a href=\"mailto:hilarycummings@cox.net\">hilarycummings@cox.net</a> if you would like to connect with me!

If the hipsters of Ahwatukee would just get over themselves this place wouldn't be all that popular.",

    "text": "I must start this off with saying that Hillside Spot is one of my favorite restaurants in town and I consider a pleasant hidden gem of the city!  I like the food, the space, and the chai tea makes my world go round.  With that being said there are some serious reoccuring issues with this place that never seem to get fixed.  I know its lame to rip on service because any server can simply be having a bad day on any given time you are being served by them.  But they have some very consistent service issues.   First, they have a beautiful, young, eclectic staff that seems to move around very fast and work pretty hard.  Sad to say, they are all learning the bad habits of each other and there is almost NO service factor present.  The in general tone of the servers isn't friendly and they don't go above and beyond.   I could list one hundred ways to change this around but there is only one key thing that really needs to be noted.  It looks like this place took out the middleman (bus boy) and the kitchen expeditor.  That is great, servers don't have to tip out so they get to keep all their tips.  But....now they are so focused on cleaning up they spend less time on other things.  The lack of a True kitchen expeditor guiding where the food goes and putting the last minute touches on the food that goes out is killing this place.  Most of the time you will find your server with his or her back turned to you while they are waiting around the island in the middle of their kitchen.  Its so crazy to have servers waiting around for food when there is so much they can do.   Hire a kitchen guru.  Have your servers helping out at the front handing out free muffin samples to waiting guests.  Pick up straw and/or torta wrappers as people are dining. Fill that water glass before the end of the meal. Ask to heat up that pastry when someone orders it.   Come on Hillside.  Go beyond just asking what someone wants and then throwing it down in front of them! I'm a huge fan and I'm rooting for you.",

    "text": "We love this place!  Have eaten here several times and experienced breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Food is fresh and prepared with care!  Mia's pancakes are to die for!  One small issue noted...we sat at the counter at our last visit, which is fun because you get to watch the going-ons inside the kitchen.  We watched one of the chef's refilling a plastic squeeze bottle with some sort of sauce.  He carefully poured the contents into the bottle and I noticed that the top had dried, crusted sauce around the edge.  Sure enough, the chef finished pouring the sauce into the bottle, used his spatula to scrape the edges back into the bottle and put the top back on without wiping it.  Wish I hadn't seen that!  Guys...wipe the tops of the bottles before putting the tops back on!  They get crusty and gross.",

    "text": "I will start with positives in the hope that a manager or owner who reads this will take it as True constructive feedback.   The atmosphere of this place is great.  I love that the music is a little loud sometimes, not all the times. I love the choice of music.  I love the big open feel and the amazing patio.  The concept of what is trying to happen here is great.  Local, fresh organic menu, and a simple (although never changing) menu at that. It brings character and a very urban feel in to Ahwatukee, which, for all intense and purposes completely lacks.  The Gallo Torta is phenomenal.  3 stars  I have been coming here for 2-3 times a week for the last 6 months.  I've had dinner and many a breakfast here.   Almost every single time I have been here, the thought has crossed my mind, \"the service is so bad here\".  There is a pretty regular rotation of 4-5 people who work the counter, taking my money.  I don't think a single one of them has ever looked at me in the eye.  No one here but maybe the taller woman, who looks like an owner, looks at people, smiles and says hello?  Its the craziest thing I've ever seen.  You are in Ahwatukee! not downtown SF...   I have asked on several occasions if I could deviate from the menu and create a egg scramble with the ingredients that are all already on the menu. Every time I am met with, \"huh, oh.. well yeah. I guess you could.\" then me, \"are you sure?\", them \" uhhh, well.... yea. I mean... i yea... I guess.\"  me \"Ok.. I ll just have the gallo torta\". \"Ok.\"    I am a regular! and the request is simple.. sheesh! Another thing.  Your cartel coffee coffee situation is in desperate need of attention.  You have like two barista's that make espresso in two totally different ways, and both are miserable. You have all the tools to make great coffee yet you don't.  The house coffee is seemingly very watered down as well. But this is a matter of my own preference and maybe isn't relevant here.   The place is always busy and I'm sure will be financially successful for years to come.  However, as I sit here writing this inside hillside spot, I believe this will be my last visit here.  Thanks for all the wifi.",

    "text": "The Hillside is close to my home and makes a nice walk with the family to go there for lunch/brunch. The food there is really good and I believe almost all food  is gathered from local growers.  I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo, eggs, cheese and potatoes. The burrito was flavorful and very good. There is also a small side of fruit served with the meal. I wish the fruit was a bit bigger.  I had a bite of my wife's torta sandwich and that was really good. That might be an option next time.  There is a nice patio outside with a fireplace as well as ample seating inside.  Service was great and food came out quickly! We'll be bake there over and over sampling other items.  Nice atmsophere that is also kid friendly.",
