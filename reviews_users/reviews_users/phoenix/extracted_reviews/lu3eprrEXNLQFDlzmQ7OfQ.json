    "text": "This new bar in Old Town is actually more of a minor reboot of was originally called The Derby Public House. The primary change being the addition of faux lowered ceiling covering the main, center bar area. Hopefully this new bar can find it's spot amongst the Old Town bar scene.   The general look and feel of the place is an upscale American take on a British pub.  I went during the week of the Super Bowl. The crowd was busy, but far from packed as the currently more popular HiFi, El Hefe and Dierks Bentley Whiskey Row bars. It is a good place to go for a slightly more intimate upscale feel when wanting to be out in Old Town, but not shouting when talking to friends over the thumping DJ sounds of those other clubs.  I was there only for the nightlife and did not try the food.",

Although we were being served by a really really nice girl, this bartender went out of his way to make rude comments because of the jersey I was wearing at the restaurant. He continued to make comments about the team I came to THEIR restaurant to watch. Pens still won the Stanley cup :) so thanks jerk!",

    "text": "My experience here was very much a positive one. I went on a crisp Friday evening specifically to get some food and a few Ducky shots for me and my guest. This place is seated in the Scottsdale horseshoe off camelback in the heart of the entertainment district. When we arrived we seated ourselves at one of the two lounge couches they provide (with a giant Connect Four game to play).  They were currently out of ducks for the ducky shots but they stated that a shipment would be arriving shortly so we knew we'd be hanging out for a bit so we started with an appetizer and a couple drinks. We tried the house poppers (bacon wrapped fresno chilies) and a soft pretzel. I was greatly surprised by the poppers as I normally am not a fan of those types of snacks (hence ordering the second app) but the one I tried was really good and I would order them again in the future so that I could sample more than one. I also had a pint of the house beer and one of their Skittles Sangrias. Man I have to tell you, after having that I want skittles in all of my sangrias from now on. What a great idea!  For the meal we shared the Patty Melt. They add a sriracha aioli to their melts which I think is a great twist on a standard patty melt and I loved the fact they use Texas Toast for the melts. That was a huge flavor changer for me!  Once the Duckies arrived we picked up a couple of them. My guest had the ducky shot and I had the Duck in a Pond (The liquor filled rubber ducky floats on a pint of beer). Well worth the wait let me tell you. Being able to keep the duck to take home after the shot was one of my favorite parts. Overall my experience was fun and relaxing. The staff is appropriately attentive, the service was prompt and always cheerful and friendly and at one point our regular server had to go home and she personally introduced us to the new server which made the transition very easy. We also had a chance to speak with one of the owners a little bit and she was incredibly friendly and welcoming. I have added The Bevvy to one of my new personal favorite places to go.",

I laughed, thinking he was joking, but he physically pulled the chair back in an attempt to eject me from the establishment. Realizing he was serious, I complied and was led out a back entrance. I calmly protested on the way out the door and was met with taunts and vague threats of violence.  I understand removing unruly or problematic patrons. But any establishment that treats gentle,  otherwise compliant paying customers so poorly should not remain in business. AVOID.",

I took a few good     5 stars not only but my review but because one of my friends forgot his credit card there and he just got it back . ;)",

    "text": "I have been to the Bevvy several times during the brunch and night life hours. I have never had an issue until my last trip there, and because of that I will not be returning. I am appalled at how I was treated by our server Marcie.   My friend ordered the 60/40 burger and received a Bevvy burger instead. When he mentioned to the waitress that he had gotten the wrong burger, she stated that he did not in fact order the 60/40 and he ordered the Bevvy. She informed us that the manager said he could not get a new patty, but that she could bring him bacon and avocado. As for the items he did not like, he could \"scrape them off of the burger\". I have never heard of something like that being said to a customer before. When I asked her if I could speak to the manager, she said \"why are you so upset? This isn't your problem\". Considering the fact that I was paying for the items ordered, it was my problem. She also lied to my face saying that she never said he could not have a new burger when I was present for the entire interaction. Wow! I have never been treated that way by a server before, nor was I rude in any way when asking to see the manager. I simply wanted the problem to be corrected. She then proceeded to walk over to the hostess table, tell the hostess the issue, and I sat there while both of them discussed it and stared at our table. I do not think that bringing a new burger to a table who were spending a lot of money there should be that much of an issue. In my eyes, the customer should always be right. Regardless, the way we were treated was unacceptable and completely uncalled for. If you don't know how to treat customers, don't work in customer service.  In the end, they did replace the burger. That is why I am giving two stars.",

The food is rather good, the prices are high compared to most other parts of the valley but not too bad for Scottsdale.  I recently found that some of the bartenders are much, much nicer than others. There is a particular bartender I have in mind that I will not point out that's been less nice to me for reasons I am unaware of. The other bartenders are still absolutely sweet to me which leaves me baffled as to what this one persons issue is with me. It's because of my repeated bad experiences and I have to drop the points for my review. It's gotten to the point where I am seriously not sure I'll be back.",

The bar staff was friendly and attentive. Bevvy has a great night scene as well. I stopped by a few nights before and loved the low key vibe it produces. I can come here in business casual attire and fit in. I mean really, sometimes the skin tight dresses and heels is too much. If that floats your boat, you will still find the young, skin tight, high heeled young ladies roaming around. It was good mix of people and the drinks were strong. None of that watered down, 2-count vodka drinks. I would recommend this spot to my girlfriends and even my boss. It hosts an atmosphere that anyone can enjoy!",

The bar tenders are totally inadequate. The one in particular was wearing more eye liner than I had ever seen in my life, so much that diner waitresses in NY would be jealous. They are losing a ton of money with employing 19 and 20 yr olds that are clueless and not efficient whatsoever. This bar needs a GM and manager that care about the P&L. Unless I have no choice because I'm with a group, I will be never returning to this joke of a bar....

I've been here twice and both times I've been told I'm \"not allowed to win\" that many drinks. First of all, the skeeball machines don't produce tickets so you have to take photos to prove when you win. That isn't a big deal, just a little annoying. The first time we came here, the owner stopped giving us the prizes we won after 5 duck shots citing that the reason is the rubber ducks are expensive. So even though we won and earned the prizes (and we're not drunk or over served) we're \"not allowed\" to win any more. I explained to them that I can understand them needing to protect their bottom line, but that they should just up the minimum points to win or change the low level prize to something less expensive if they don't want people to win too much. Also, the amount of money we were putting in playing skeeball evens out the amount we won. All that aside, we decided to give it a second chance. I figured I knew their policy and I planned to play only up to 5 rubber duck shots and then I would stop. This time the owner told her bartender to stop giving us prizes after 4 ducks! We had even won 6 Jameson shots and only claimed 3 of them. I keep leaving this place super disappointed. Just fix your skeeball machine rules and you'll be fine - it's seriously not that hard.",

First off, our booth was covered in crumbs when we went to sit down. Then, I ordered a beer and they either had the wrong tap label or the keg was bad because it was definitely not what I ordered. Our server immediately got me another one and it was the same taste. She didn't charge me for the beer, but I was still disappointed I couldn't get the right beer at a bar. Then, as we were waiting for our food (we sat right by the food window) we watched the manager (I assume) eat a French fry off one of our plates before they got served to us. I have never witnessed something so blatantly unprofessional and disgusting in any restaurant. To top it all off there were flies everywhere when we were trying to eat, we had to keep shooing them off our food. When we paid our bill, we made sure to let our waitress know what happened with the guy eating our food. He overheard us telling her and tried to say there's a side plate sitting in the window for employees to eat off of. Even if that were the case, it is still completely unprofessional and not to mention a health violation to eat and then serve food without washing your hands.",

Hell, even the bathroom attendant is a chill guy. But let me tell you the real reason to go to this old town fountain, manager Cam Byram and his glorious beard. I've known this cat for years and he consistently works hard, smiles big, and always makes sure that you and your crew are having the greatest time possible. Honestly, I would come see him wherever he works, but the Byram/Bevvy combo is a beautiful thing and should be on the list of must-see's for anyone looking to enjoy themselves in old town Scottsdale. Trust me. Just do it.",

    "text": "ENVIRONMENT REVIEW - So I have to be honest, I was really looking forward to eating here after reading a few reviews.  If it weren't the only restaurant on the block open at 11 am, we would have left and gone to a different restaurant immediately after walking in and being blasted with the artificial perfumes that were absolutely overwhelming. When people visit restaurants, they expect to smell food, which is the start of their digestive process, so it's super important for many reasons to NOT artificially smell your restaurant up. For beginners, many people, like me, are allergic or chemically sensitive to a handful of ingredients in those artificial perfumes. It's really bothersome to drive a good distance and want to stay and spend money at your restaurant when all I can taste is the coating of the perfume on my tongue. It was no better in the bathroom as the aroma was still very strong. Soon after being exposed, my ears were ringing and I could feel tightness in my chest.  It was very uncomfortable and hard to enjoy lunch.  Unless this changes, I certainly won't be back.   The bar are was pretty cool. Plenty of TVs for sports, and they had beer specials!!  FOOD REVIEW - I had a burger without the bun ordered medium rare. It was not cooked correctly and was a bit too chewy. My husband got the wings. Cooked correctly and he even said hey were the best wings he'd ever had!! That's HUGE coming from him because we eat wings in nearly every \"wing\" restaurant in every city we travel to - and I travel each week for my job, so we're in many different cities eating wings. If the smelly stuff gets corrected, I'd come back for the wings for sure!  We were happy they served all drums!!  STAFF REVIEW - our waitress was extremely nice! She was knowledgeable about the food but not really about gluten. She was on top of our drinks the entire time and was just very kind. She made recommendations for meal choices as well.   OVERALL - overall I can always try a different meal, but I can't get over the horrible smell. If that changes, I'd definitely give this place another try!",

The services were great by the way they checked on me or us in certain times to make sure we all had a good time (we did).

I went late night with a friend and the atmosphere was what sold me. All the employees worked really well together, drinks came fast & tasted great, the photo booth is a thoughtful touch, & the HD mirrors in the bathrooms are the best place to take a selfie - or group shot with your bestie :) I also really appreciated the DJ. I love to dance & I couldn't help but feel the music all night! Idk if it was the drinks or the DJ - probs a combo of both lol.   I later came back to dine there & Bevvy has a great menu - they offer a protein bowl and a ton of other healthy options. and just a side note - I'm extremely picky when it comes to eggs at a restaurant & their eggs are phenomenal, for being a sports bar I was shocked. I just really like Bevvy & I will keep going back :) thanks guys - seriously keep it up :)",

But, that doesn't warrant so few stars. No, our server is fully responsible for the missing stars.  We saw our server when she took our order. Someone else brought the food. Someone else cleared the table. Then we sat for what felt like an eternity. In fact, I'm writing this review while we wait to see her again. TWO different servers keep walking by but have NEVER made eye contact with either of us. The guys at the table next to us are angry. The people behind my wife are visibly upset. This is inexcusable.  I won't give up on this place because I want to have a place near home to watch Michigan Football with fellow fans. I'll report back at the next visit, which will probably be a Michigan game.",

    "text": "Update 9/23/17 So I was surprised to see a response from a Bevvy manager or owner?  Either way I am appreciative they read and responded.  For that I will give them another go as we've had a great time here in the past.    We've been here before and nothing out of the ordinary.  We know coming here on a Friday or Saturday night you will be dealing with crowds and you have to be strategic in getting your drinks.  Any of the bars in the area we can have a good time and Bevvy has been fun in the past.  But this place stuck out for one reason this past weekend.  We attended the \"I love the 90's beer crawl\" and Bevvy was one of the participating bars.  Each bar had their own drink specials and times.  Some went from 2pm - 10 pm, some from 2pm -3pm and after 7pm.  So we were spending at every place and we came back around to Bevvy.  I admittedly got drink specials mixed up and ordered a Green Tea shot.  Never had one but figured we'd try all the drink specials from each participating bar.  After finally getting the bartenders attention I announced \"2 green tea shots\". Blonde Bartender with attitude looks at me, mutters something, turns and makes drinks.  As I was getting mixed up with other bars that had $5.00 green tea shots, I fork out a $20.00 and hand to Blonde Attitude when she presents drinks.  She slams them down, snatches $20.00 and disappears.  So I'm now standing their waiting for change.  She reappears, no eye contact nothing just refuses to acknowledge I'm trying to get her attention.  Finally she storms over \"What!\"  I calmly ask if she's getting my change.  She immediately fires back \"wrong bar, wrong drink hunny!\"  No big deal but she knew full well with her immediate and explosive remark I was wrong.  Could of simply said \"Sir, we don't have that special\".  Was there all afternoon with the typical crowds and Blonde Attitude was the nastiest bartender we encountered.  I tried one more time to get clarification and she goes on another rant \"listen hunny, it's f-ng loud in here, I know what the fk I'm doing hunny, blah blah blah, and by the way this shizz ended at 7:00pm hunny.\"  (Event ended at 10:00pm, was 8:00 pm at that time). My wife had just walked up before BA's rant and even though she is a business professional, sweet and has common courtesy this did not set well with her.  I had to restrain her from jumping over the bar and giving sassy mouth a old fashioned whooping.    So my advice to Bevvy bartender.   1.  If you don't like crowds, noise or stress, you probably aren't in the right profession or location. 2.  Customer service for you equates tips.  We actually tip well.  Not for you of course. 3.  Don't call patrons hunny if you don't know them.  It's disrespectful. 4.  Your language was uncalled for and hope you went home and washed your mouth out with soap.  Other than Blonde Attitude, Bevvy has been fun in the past, but this was also our second time having issues with a rude employee at this location.  So we won't be back.  Plenty other places to go to.",

Actually a lot of them are nice in the day time... once it gets party time in the evening good luck black folks!! I went last night and I'm in total shock STILL. I live in the Stetsons and have spent a lot of money at Bevvys. Last night I went with a friend to the bar and when the blonde came to our side after I'd patiently been waiting and helped a guy who pushed up in front of me I said \"awh no fair dude\" to the guy... she then turns to me and goes completely off telling me I'm yelling at her (I wasn't even talking to her) and literally leaves and comes back to talk shit to me several times. It was unreal. Every time she came to me I calmly said to her \"I'm not yelling at you I can barely hear you\"... I'm talking to my friend embarrassed at this point like \"I don't know what's up with her she's like trying to start a problem with me\". I am then out of nowhere being approached by SECURITY who aggressively puts his hands on me as if I'm being belligerent and I have to ask him to stop touching me. He continues on until I am outside and threatens me with the police to which I respond \"I literally haven't done a single thing I'd LOVE for the police to come\" in fact thank god there was an officer observing me being calm and the security being insane and the office politely taps me and says \"just come over here sweetheart\".... as I'm being KICKED out for NO reason my friend was still at the bar super confused and the same blonde ask him if he's leaving too and that I was being attitudey with her which he thought was insane. BEING A BLACK WOMAN DOES NOT MAKE ME INTIMIDATING AND ATTITUDEY!! How dare she!? BEVVYS IS NOT WELCOMING TO BLACKS!!!!! If I seen that bartender right now I would literally ask her calmly what was the problem & she'd have no reason!! I never raised my voice (besides being in a loud ass bar) I never cursed at her I never called her out her name I never bothered her once... THEN TO TOP IT OFF ONE OF THE PROMOTER ASSHOLES TOOK PICTURES OF ME ON HIS PHONE! What the entire hell? I will absolutely pursue this further. I'm still so shocked I was treated this way. I'm Mortified.",

    "text": "Bevvy is like this... mystical place where you're genuinely greeted after a long, terrible day at work and everyone there knows what you need before you even ask. The staff are such caring and tentative people. This place holds a special place in my heart. My previous boss/friend Joe loved bringing everyone to Bevvy after work to get drinks, unwind,vent about our day, whatever we needed. He's no longer with us so we come to Bevvy to remember him and have a good time in his honor and simply have fun.   The food is always hot, really well prepared and priced perfectly. (to anyone reading this, get some wings!)  The superstar staff is one of many reasons I keep coming back. I had a conversation with Graham one weekend about a few of the rules and regulations that are followed by some members of the weekend staff and he addressed all of my concerns in detail (as much as possible) and it made me feel so much better. The company that I work for has office Happy Hours here often, which can be about 100-150 people. Never have we felt ignored or forgotten. Bronwyn is by far the best server I've had at any restaurant. So personable and kind. I had actually ran into her a week after the first time she served my friend an I and she remembered me, came up to me and my friends to warmly greet us and ask how our week was. Then, even knowing that we weren't in her section she immediately went to let our server know we were sat down. That leads me to talk about Jessie, who is just magical. Always smiling, jocular, tentative. I'm telling you, you've got 10's across the board.   Companies/Businesses that REALLY value their people and value their customers will ALWAYS have regulars and will ALWAYS be around.   Thank you for what you've created here in little ol' Old Town.",

    "text": "Bevvy has been one of my favorite places to go for the three years I've lived in the valley. After the way my boyfriend was treated tonight i truly will never go back, which is sad because i have always enjoyed their music, vibe and service. We've spent thousands of dollars on bottle service over the years and have supported the establishment even on their least busy nights. My boyfriend was turned away at the door simply for \"wearing a raptors jersey\".... (we were on a jersey/sports themed bar crawl, it was 7 pm) literally thought the door guy was kidding because his coworkers said it was all good. So my boyfriend turned his jersey inside out, thinking it was the team and maybe it offended people? (Retro Tracy McGrady raptors jersey....). The manager comes out screaming threatening to \"tase\" my boyfriend. Unreal. Discriminatory and aggressive at the very least. Bevvy turned down a party of 20+ people so their door guy could feel tough for 3 minutes of his life, while my boyfriend who was just trying to enjoy his best friends birthday was embarrassed and discriminated against simply for his shirt. I can understand \"refusing the right to serve\"  people who are too drunk, disrespectful or just all around disorderly. This wasn't the case. Luckily every other bar in old town was happy to take our business and provide us with kind and fun bottle service. Unfortunate i will never take my business back to Bevvy because it truly has always been my #1 choice no matter the occasion. Moral of the story: their lame door guy apparently makes the rules and has a poor sense of style, and is discriminatory toward the color purple..and their manager will threaten to tase you for nothing. not the type of place i want to be in! I'll go to whiskey row and riot house for future occasions. Do not recommend bevvy.  Ever.",

I ate it due to the fact that I was very hungry but it does bother me that they advertise and charge for a premium product and seem to scam you out of your money. I included pictures to compare because they are vastly different. Also the service has always been spotty every time I've gone so this was just the last straw.",

    "text": "I was only in town for a really brief period, so having been to bevvy three separate times must be saying something. Especially in this district of Scottsdale with bars lining the streets. Proceed reading with this knowledge, though: I'm a teetotaler, so I can't say a dang thing about the drinks.  What I can report on, though, is that the place is totally chill. The check-in offer alone is worth the trip: when we visited the check-in offer on Yelp was a free mustache ride. There's a mechanical horse out front named \"Mustache\" and you get token to take a ride. If that wasn't enough, it's all set to the tune of \"Pony\" by Ginuwine. Well played.  Inside, it's a spacious place that rides that fine line between upscale hipster precious, and dive bar. It's definitely not either of those things. But you don't pay a premium for weird muddled things served up by dudes in suspenders. Yet you're not exactly in Bud Light territory either. Hard to explain, but you can get a simple well drink here and spread out among the tables with a group of pals and feel right at home. Or sit at the bar and hang out like we did the first night. Your call.  No scene, no hype, no presh. Drinks. Maybe catch a happy hour for some light snacks and easy drinks.",

    "text": "I've been to Bevvy a handful of times, a few months ago I made the switch to becoming a vegetarian. Prior to making the switch Ive had bevvy's lunch/dinner , which was always super yummy. Now that I am a vegetarian I wasn't really sure what to order on the menu, that's when I asked a worker what he suggested. David introduced himself and took a few minutes to explain what they had to offer that would fit my needs. I ended up choosing the rice bowl with extra veggies (one of Davids choices) and it was unbelievably good. Not only was I happy with my experience, but it amazed me that even though David was busy handling his own tasks (which did not include being my server) he still took a few minutes to make my experience a special one. This is exactly what makes normal customers become loyal customers. Safe to say, I will be around more thanks to my encounter with David! & the great rice bowl with extra veggies ;)",

The bacon popcorn is a great starter and the hummus was tasty.  The place was packed,  and the service was great.  Lauren, the Owner, was so nice and accommodating. I am hoping they open one in South Tempe soon. A great place after the gym!!",

We were here on a Friday evening about 9 or 10 and they had a fun selection of music with videos playing.  The beer price was average.  $5.00 for a bud light.  Not the cheapest around but doable.

I wish bars would recognize that people want to try their signature cocktails, not some vodka and cranberry on special... Regardless, they do have discounted apps, which is awesome. We tried the pretzels with beer cheese and mustard.... this was a large plate of perfectly salted soft pretzels with a small container of cheese and mustard (could give a little bit more, but you know...). In addition to happy hour, they offered a few different types of alcohol on special for 5$, which was nice. My friend had some kind of honey southern comfort and cranberry.... yikes....not awesome. At least it was cheap. Further, a waitress came around giving out free drinks (green tea whiskey or something...) . You can't argue with free! The atmosphere and service in the bar was great.

Sure, it's occasionally fun but it gets old faster than that avocado you just broke into 5 minutes ago.  For anyone who wants a more traditional, sustainable adult experience from a local bar where people go to watch sports, have real conversations, eat delicious food and enjoy cocktails made by professionals who know how to do more than mix vodka with your redbull, go to Bevvy.   Maegan, Aubree and the rest of the staff will take great care of you and treat you like a paying customer should be treated!",

The Bevvy has a great Happy Hour...can't beat the 22 oz. beers and my burger was excellent...and the shoestring fries are the bomb We split a couple orders of the Poppers and Buffalo Drummies...can't beat it with a cold brew!!  I also have to give a shout out on the TVs...nothing worse (well maybe there are some things worse) than a sports bar where you can't see the TVs!! Bevvy is definitely one of the best in downtown Scottsdale for watching the games....a lot of large well placed tv's to see all the games!  (also the scenery is pretty good...I'm just saying)  All in all, great spot with a great vibe!  Next up, we're going to go back for the Sunday brunch.",

Let me start by saying I am a little biased because I am a Wolverine Fan, and this is the official U of M bar -- so I frequent Bevvy to watch U of M football games. That being said, I LOVE the music, especially because it's often old school hip hop/r&b mixed with a little new school - which is totally my thing.   The bar is in the center of the establishment. There is high top and booth seating inside and hightop seating outside. I almost always choose to sit outside so I can people watch. The only downside of outdoor seating is smoke. They have several fun, yard games for entertainment too.   Food is good and depending on when you go they have brunch, appetizers/snacks, and other sandwich and bar menu options. One of my favorite items is the popcorn served with bits of BACON...yum. How can you ever go wrong with bacon?! Service is usually pretty good although depending on the crowd or event you'll definitely have a wait for food/drinks. Seating is first come first serve but I always seem to be able to find a nice place to sit comfortably.   What I love most about Bevvy is the chill atmosphere and great music.",

The burger is gone from happy as well and while you used to get two pretzels for $5, now they only give you one for seven bucks. Every time a restaurant opens another outpost they pass on the costs to innocent consumers. The pretzels were good, but at 7 bucks it doesn't seem like a happy Hour deal anymore. It's not the prices, it's the spirit of happy Hour that is being violated all over. The mixed drinks are still $3, but small draft beers jumped up a buck to $4.",

The games are uber fun because there is a DJ playing during the breaks, and the crowd is normally amped up.  Big-time Wolverine fan Jeff P advises that to guarantee a seat during bball/football season, you should expect to arrive fairly early - the UMAA board already has a few booths reserved during the games.  I really dig their drinks, chicken fingers and Bevvy burgers, but the fries are lacking and inconsistent - either over- or under-seasoned. If they could address that and the reasoning behind having the fries take up way more space than the chicken fingers, I could be a fan. It's like a plate of fries with a side of chicken fingers :( Service can also be spotty during games and non-games time alike which is disappointing, especially if you give ample time in-between what you order.",

Completely unacceptable for the price. The bartender was very busy and I felt bad for bringing the drink back. He was rude, but I understood. I went to Bottled Blonde and ordered the same shot for the same price, but it was ACTUALLY what I ordered and not some cheap knock off crap served to save money.

I don't remember the name of the Tequila/Margarita drink that's on the Happy Hour menu, but it was super sour.  I mean really sour.  2 people in my party of 8 had to send it back and get something else.  Everyone else enjoyed their happy hour drinks thoroughly.  We also enjoy everything we ordered to eat.    Between the 8 of us we shared the following items: Queso + Tortilla = Quesadilla, Soft Pretzels & Fondue, House made Hummus, Grass fed Bevvy Burger, Baja Burrito, Old Bay Steak Fries and Bevvy Signature Tater Tots.  Out of everything we ate my absolutely favorite items were: The Chicken Quesadilla, Soft Pretzels & Fondue and the Old Bay Steak Fries.  EVERYONE loved the Old Bay Steak Fries.  I highly recommend them.    Aside from the awesome drinks and food, the Bevvy also has a cool ass DJ and DJ Booth, Shuffle Boards, Skeeball, Darts and Jenga ... Giant Jenga (Hell Yeah).

Bevvy is \"an English Gastropub with a few modern American twists\".  From Mustache Rides (tip: check in on Yelp!) to games outside on the tape (Connect Four, anyone?) to television after television, there's something fun for everyone.  I think I even saw some board games sitting by the front door.  I look forward to coming back to Bevvy now that we're in the heat of college basketball season, especially as March Madness gets closer.  Plus, this is a great location next to other clubs, bars, and restaurants in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.    The food and drinks are delicious!  Plus, the service is superb.  Over the evening, those I was with and I were asked if we needed anything time after time.  At other places, it could be a challenge to have someone check on us more than once.  I highly recommend the Loaded Popped Corn (applewood smoked bacon fat popcorn with parmesan cheese).  In addition to a full menu, there is a nice brunch menu and a happy hour menu with lots of special deals!  While it's out of my price range, they do have a Bevvy Champagne Breakfast with two applewood smoked bacon wrapped corn dogs and a bottle of Dom Perignon Vintage 2004 for $250!    There are also some great special events that take place.  If I would have made it to 8 PM this evening (Wednesday), I could have taken part in Game Night!  Happy Hours are weekdays from 4-7 PM, and Saturday is Adult Power Hour from 7-9 PM.  Reservations can easily be made on their website (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbevvyaz.com&s=f2c1febf76b7b1f9622b7a6469241c280521fde3e3096e33616dbae9b4257c40\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bevvyaz.com</a>) or on Open Table.    So if you're up for a fun time at a gastropub, this is your place!!",

    "text": "I grew up in Scottsdale and can't believe how much this area has changed over the years. Bevvy is in the heart of the downtown entertainment district. They are a neighborhood gastropub run by Evening Entertainment Group (RnR, HiFi Kitchen + Cocktails) and one of the only licensed off-track horse racing betting pubs in AZ. I really like their spacious patio area, leather booths, wood-paneled walls and the variety of TV screens and yard games throughout the bar. They have killer happy hour prices and a food menu that includes a variety of appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, salads and bowls. I've only been here for drinks but love coming here to watch sports highlights. Try one of their mules - they are delicious. If you want to channel your inner Tom Hanks and see your future, they have one of those Zoltar machines on hand (they still creep me out). Their patio area is pretty spacious and dog friendly. Only bummer for me is that they are the headquarters for the New England Patriots and that Tucson team during football season. Check out their second location in uptown Phoenix!",

People who ordered well after me got their food before I.    I was at a table of 3.  The lady at my table received the wrong order all together and the other guy had a burger that was 50% well done and 50% raw.  Not sure how that happenes, but it did.    They did give us a free shot and I a beer.   The manager never stopped by.  You'd think he'd want to show his face, but maybe that is why all the issues took place as he may be too distant to help solution issues.   I won't return.",

The happy hour beer special is set up so that you actually pay more per ounce if you get the bigger beer. I'm sure a lot of people just go bigger because that usually means they're getting more for less, if the management is aware of this then they're exploiting people's expectations. The second reason is the guy tending bar when I popped in here one Friday night around 9 was rude. We were the only customers and he acted like we were an inconvenience. All that said, I'll be back for happy hour!",

Burger was good other than the strange choice of greens on top, had a strange flavor not like lettuce. As someone else stated, the steak fries came out barely warm and soggy.  The part that really pissed of my girlfriend is when they started stacking bottles and ice buckets right in the middle of our table to prepare for some \"bottle service\"  as if we weren't even there.  It's not like they even asked or said anything, they just used the table we were eating and drinking at as a work station.  It seemed a little rude so we didn't stick around.  Yeah sorry but no....we were not informed of anything by anyone when we sat down.  Taking away one star for lying on the reply.....how pathetic.",

So after about 10 minutes we had to leave on principal alone. So next-door to Bevy we went. Sat down at their bar and prayed for something better. Not only did we get something better, but something rare and stellar. Quick greeting and quick to get us a drink. Thank you. And then . . . what you almost never see, the bartender extends his arm across the bar and says, \"Hi, I'm Steve. How are you guys?\" Great service. Healthy food options at a bar - also awesome. Needless to say we returned more times during our vacation there.",

    "text": "Where to start...   Well first off we decided to come to Bevvy for Preakness after first coming for the Kentucky Derby. We thought hey this is a super cool place looks like it has changed a lot from the previous owners. But oh boy were we proven wrong by the servers and the \"managing partner\".  The story is we had arrived at Bevvy today at around 11am, the races didn't start for a few hours. We had reserved a table which we were well aware was going to be $300 when we had reserved it, that's not the issue. When we arrived everyone was scrambling to figure out what table we belonged at. So we finally get a table and sit down, once we get that table, sit and order our food and drinks, we're moved within 20 minutes. Lovely. This is just the beginning of a wonderful experience.. At this point I can tell.   So after this we get out unlimited mimosas, and we order a second round of food for the other half of the table. At this point we are an hour in and the bottle of premium liquor that we were promised still has not shown up..So we wait patiently and the second half of the table gets there food within minutes, the first half has been waiting for about an hour now. No one knows that we have been waiting, and the waitress does not care. It took another waitress coming up to us asking if we needed anything to figure out that we were missing half a table of food. This is still after several people tried to walk up and serve us the wrong plates.   Once we had gotten that all was fine, it started getting busy, we are full and just getting drinks. So 3pm rolls around and we are told the unlimited mimosas are done. That's fine, the races are going to start and we are ready to head out. That's when the server walks up and says, \"So there is a $300 minimum on a table...\" Oh... Okay.. we didn't realize that and this was because the \"managing partner\" did not communicate that.. Probably because it was so formal and mostly over text message (sarcasm). So at this point we have not received $300 worth of food or service and we refuse to pay this. At this point the server is so rude and short with us (although we disclosed that we would take care of her because it wasn't her fault.).   We ended up leaving a $65 dollar tab on a $100 dollar bill. She told us we had to immediately leave because we didn't pay for the table. As I walk away I look around and see other tables paying their $30 tabs between 6 different cards and apparently that is just fine. Well that's wonderful, I'll let  everyone know not to head over to Bevvy because apparently table minimum is $300.. Well for us I guess.. We were the lucky ones that were the exception because we had chosen to reserve a table. Like I said $300, not a big deal.. But I expect $300 worth of service and to be told that my table did not have a bottle. In the end we had gotten the minimum waived, and to be greeted, moving forward, by the snarkiest, most rude server.   All-in-all I see that although this place has changed ownership it has not changed it's employees or management which was about %85 of the previous problem and why derby no longer stands to exist. I hope that something is done about your rude, ignorant, and predatory staff because I for one will not be back and I will be sure to let anyone I know going to old town to avoid this place like the plague.   You have minimal reviews on this place and it is going to look like derby did in a few months if it continues. Good concept, could be amazing if the management actually cared.   Avoid this place.",

We arrived before 11pm on a Saturday evening and avoided a line and cover. Not sure if there's ever a cover but there definitely was a line later! First thing I noticed... fun hip-hop music. Yesss. Second thing, the place is kind of dive like but there is a dance floor and it's not grimy like some more casual spots I've experienced.  We were so kindly offered a table near the front of the bar and a comp bottle of liquor of our choice, as long as we tipped. Thank you thank you! I suppose a group of girls dressed in hot pink near the entrance might bring in some customers but I definitely couldn't complain. We stayed until closing dancing and enjoying the music and drinks. The crowd was fairly young (twenties) although there was a variety of patrons present.   Would I come back again if visiting Scottsdale again? For sure!",

Worth the trip just to have him make you a drink.   When you think of the top places to visit in the World you probably think of the Eiffel Tower, Buckingham palace, Dan Bilzerian's House, or Coachella. But you would be wrong, it's Bevvy. Whether you need to set the new high score of 177 on pop a shot, order the #1 rated wings (by a local wing reviewer) in Scottsdale, or have a proper blackout when it picks up on the weekend nights. This is your place to go!",

Service can get a bit slow during games because it gets packed, but the staff is always friendly - and usually decked out in Patriots gear! Drinks are always strong too. The vibe and community during games is a blast, even if you're not a Pats fan.  Note that you can book tables and/or get bottle service, and when NE makes playoffs, this is the only way to get a table.  I've been to the uptown Phx location, and these may as well be two different companies. The vibe in Old Town is much, much better, and they always have the best DJ!",

    "text": "I was looking for a place to have some bar food and watch a game on Whiskey Row. Amongst all of the many similar options (seriously, this block is littered with sports bars) Bevvy had the highest rating. Normally I wouldn't really care but we were super hungry after a long flight and wanted decent food.  The food definitely didn't disappoint. My chicken gyro was bursting with flavor, and came with lots of fresh chopped veggies and tzatziki sauce. The order came with a side of out of this world parmesan truffle fries. My husband ordered a fried chicken sandwich and really enjoyed it.   There were a lot of other redeeming qualities about Bevvy. Great beers on draft, tons of TVs for game watching and open walls to create an indoor / outdoor dining setting. I also really liked the fact that they had skee ball and other bar games to enjoy.   Unfortunately, Bevvy really fell short in the service department. They were understaffed by like 10 people on Friday at peak happy hour time. Not good. What was supposed to be a one hour dining experience took more like three hours. When we were done eating I asked multiple people if I could pay them for our check (we didn't really have an assigned waiter). It took so long that I was wondering if they honestly wanted us to skip out on the bill. There is only so long I can wait and continue to ask to pay without wanting to leave.  It's a shame that the food was good, because I probably would not choose to have a sit down meal here ever again. But for drinks and skee ball I'm all over it.",

I got the muscle bowl which I assumed would be a salad of sorts but came as just separated things on a plate. Overall it was decent but the portion was definitely smaller than anticipated and the shrimp was just breaded frozen shrimp you'd buy at supermarket.  The actual bar/restaurant was pretty cool though, it was a big space with an open concept with some outdoor seating, plenty of tvs to watch the games, and a few arcade games as well.   I'll give this spot another try for the bar scene but for food I'll probably choose one of the other 15 restaurants in the area.",

Since a couple of my gal pals come from the North Scottsdale area, thought I'd hold it here.  I can't remember the name of our server, but she was a very charming, professional, efficient young lady.   She said she wanted to be like us when she is our age.   Really??   Yes, it's True, we do have a lot of fun!!  We perused the happy hour cocktail list to get our drinks.  We all agreed the drinks were the best.   Therefore, had to have at least one more!  For our HH food we had the poppers, pretzel, quesadilla, and chip trio.   Plenty of food, that is for sure!   I liked all of it.   If I was to say which ones I liked the best, I'd say the quesadilla, poppers, pretzel and chips, in that order.   The quesadilla had the right amount of cheese and guac that one couldn't possibly go wrong.   The poppers were a tiny bit hot but not much.   The pretzel with its accompanying cheese dip was, well, yes, nothing out of the ordinary.   Same with the chips and the three dips.  Since we were celebrating my birthday, we asked what was on the dessert menu.   Now, that was a disappointment.   I guess desserts aren't high on the list of importance by any means.   We decided on the ice cream sandwich.   I was not impressed.   There wasn't much to it, and the top and bottom cookies were harder than a rock.   Oh, well.   I guess it wasn't supposed to be the highlight of the evening. ...  I would definitely return.   The menus at the Scottsdale and Uptowne locations aren't the same.   I think the Uptowne location has a more \"mature\" clientele, therefore, fits the area.",

Oh, and the music is eclectic enough you don't feel like you're listening to the same playlist on repeat.   I'm giving 4 out 5 stars because lunch service can sometimes be pretty slow, even if the place has a lot of empty tables. Two of those times, the waiter was on her phone which at the time, was pretty frustrating (specially needing to get back to work).  Still, it doesn't outweigh the good things the place has!",

The bartenders were smokeshows.  They have cocktails on their menu, but I stuck to Coors Light.  After six and a \"muscle bowl\" entree, my bill was only $27, pretty cheap for Scottsdale.    A welcomed change to a sports bar?  Yeah, they actually serve GOOD food.  The muscle bowl was quite healthy as well.  I don't need to sell you on Coors Light do I?  I'm convinced to return for sports.  This is the place to be young wild and free.    Tip of the hat Miss Bevvy.",

The atmosphere is always electric on Saturday game days, and it has the food and drink to match.  I usually go with a group of fellow Michigan enthusiasts and aim for a high top near the outside patio, which provides a good watching location.  They have awesome specials on mimosas (you can get a whole bottle of champagne at a great price) and the beer list is decent, although not exhaustive.  Food is your typical pub fare, I've found the Bevvy burger to be very good, and it's usually my go-to item.  During the Michigan games they usually have a solid DJ that will really amp you up during the commercials.  Combined with the excitement of the game many times I can hardly stay seated!  If you're planning on going for one of the big games of the year (see: Michigan State or Ohio State), plan on being there hours (at least two) in advance.  You'd be surprised how many Michigan fans there are in the valley that come out for these games.",

Come with a group and snag a booth or table before the bar/restaurant gets full because this is a pretty popular place! Sometimes less popping during holidays, it just depends. I came here on July 4th around 1 p.m. and it was pretty dead, but as the day went on, more people arrived..not so crowded though. You can see this place get crowded on holidays such as St. Patrick's Day or...President's Day? Maybe.  A lot of people come here after work for happy hour any time during the week, because, you know...corporate life!  *Service* the staff is super friendly and service is prompt. Even when Bevvy gets pretty busy, there's always someone nearby to get the attention of when you need something.  Food:  *Shrimp Tacos* battered shrimp with slaw in either flour/corn tortilla with a wedge of lime on the side. Delish.  *Chicken Quesadilla* their quesadillas cheese/chicken, are probably one of my favorite quesadillas I have ever tasted. It comes with sides of sour cream, guacamole, and salsa. The quesadilla is also a part of the happy hour menu, so it's a steal.   Drinks:  Bottle of Prosecco for $28 is a steal. Also, I just discovered (from a meme) that a glass of prosecco has less calories than a banana...so yeah go ahead and get a whole bottle of prosecco.

    "text": "First of all, I hate writing bad reviews. Alright here it goes... This has been a long time coming since I've been to Bevvy multiple times and have ALWAYS had BAD service so I figured my review was due. I know what you're thinking \"well why does she keep going back,\" well the answer is my FRIENDS! We went on a SLOW Saturday afternoon, sat on the patio with literally 5 other people besides our party of 3. Everything started fine until we received our food. All 3 food orders were wrong! We then waited 10 minutes until I finally got up to find our waitress to tell her that our food orders were wrong. She then blamed it on the cooks (it's always a team effort, take some responsibility.) Then she refused to come to our table after our encounter. My friend had to get up again and find her to get our check after waiting 30 minutes after initially requesting it. It gets better... After we paid, she rushed to see how much we tipped her. As I was walking out the door she asked if we had bad service (probably because she saw her tip, which I still tipped her 18%, which is really low for me since I also work in the industry), I admittedly said YES! She then says \"You obviously don't come around here cuz that's how it is.\" (WHAT?!!) My question is, why do these servers in that area of Old Town think they deserve even 18% if they know that they aren't doing their job? You're a server who gets paid off of tips so if you want a big tip, DO your job! It's simple! Thanks for reading! I hope this place improves because it definitely has potential and the food WAS pretty good.",

We had the jalapeno poppers (which are one of my now must have all the time items), a patty melt with the shoestring pepper fries and the pretzels with fondue! It was all really delicious, besides shoe string fries you have have Steak Fries, Tater Tots, a Side Salad, or Soup. I really wanted to eat more food but was stuffed.  I had a Melancholy Mule which is indeed served in a copper mug! It was delicious, light and refreshing! I also had 2 ducky shots, because they're just sooo adorable! They definitely pack a punch though. ADDED BONUS YOU GET TO KEEP THE DUCK!!! You can have the ducky shot 4 ways, as a shot, as a duck in a pond (the duck floats in a pint of beer), a duck in a lake (the duck floats in a larger glass of beer), or you can play ducky roulette :D which is great for a group! Happy Hour is excellent $3 wells and beers, 1/2 off appetizers and there's even a $5 burger with fries! There's plenty of seating that can suit everyone, there's high tops, booths, couches and a sizeable patio!  I really can't wait to go back! The servers are also amazing, very attentive without smothering and they are knowledgeable about everything on the menu, from the beers to the foods!",

My buddy William (White Hat) was joking with the group how he had ordered the healthiest thing on the menu (because he's a professional CrossFit athlete)When the server brought his meal to the table he made a joke as well and said \"who ordered the healthiest thing on the menu\". Little things like that make this more the just your typical Scottsdale bar. The food is like a cornucopia of bursting goodness into your mouth. With juicy flavor in over the top presentation it's like the Bobby Flay of bar food. Almost everyone at the table had the rice bowl with added chicken. One person which will remain nameless Kelsey got no chicken(she doesn't care about them gainz). Every time I have gone there it's like watching ASU lose. It doesn't matter how many times it happens it's always a great experience. Also this place has a great ceiling. The one tip I would give anybody going here on Lunch.  Make sure you let your staff know how much time you have some times their turnaround time is long.",

The only challenge I had was the volume the music was turned to at 7 pm.  I suppose it may be that I'm older, but if you don't have dancing, then let me have a conversation with my table mates without using my cheerleader voice.  I know in that area, loud music helps draw people in, but I literally couldn't hear anything anyone was saying unless they were yelling.  It was a good time to end our evening.   Overall, I would recommend it for a great night starter. Or even for lunch to kick off some day drinking.",

    "text": "Let me clear on a couple things.   1. I came here to watch a football game as this was listed as the Alumnus Bar for the University of Michigan and not to start my evening before touring Old Town.  2. We were sequestered outside, which between the occasional cluster of party-goers, as opposed to Michigan (or Iowa) fans, meant we were exposed to a litany of smells (horse manure on the sidewalk, just beyond the railing) and the occasional customer who insisted on standing behind us (depsite there being hardly any room). 3. The service was pretty consistent, even when we stuck to water in lieu of alcohol.  4. The game in question was during the evening. So it's unclear if a DJ would be present, which might mitigate some of the observations listed below.  Pros: Menu. The menu is everything you'd expect from a bar, as it relates to 'pub' food. Albeit the Wedge was drowning in Bleu Cheese dressing, while the Pretzel appetizer had the right amount of sauce. Beer. The draft selection was your usual Budweiser / Guinness list, with a smattering of 'craft'.  Independents included Deschutes (Fresh Squeezed), Huss (Scottsdale Blonde). Eventually, I switched to PBR as drinking pints of craft beer was getting expensive.  Cons: Volume. As we were outside and under the speakers, this removed a star from the overall rating, as the bar insisted on giving the DJ airtime, during the commercial breaks. Imagine watching a football game, the roar of the crowd, and then wham! dubstep or Kid Rock blaring into your skull.  Crowds. If you're looking for a comfortable seating experience, don't go here. On several occasions, the table to our left continued to accommodate more of their fans while leaving little room for my spouse to move. Needless to say, the staff who were walking around took no interest in ensuring proper seating per table.  Overall. As a visiting alum, who only wished to be around like-minded alums, I will more than likely not returning, unless one of them can assure me that morning/afternoon games are nothing like what I experienced that evening.   If on the other hand, you enjoy loud music, attendance so dense that a fire marshall would squeal with glee, then you'll fit right in.   -Re-visit to be determined.",

    "text": "I visited Bevvy for the first time last weekend. I am also in the industry so headed out to grab drinks with friends after work. It was Saturday night around 12:30am & old town was crowded as expected. Nonetheless, I am appalled by the bar service here! The bartenders served me 3 margaritas that were basically 100% mixer. When you're paying $8 per drink + tipping reasonably... I don't need to say more lol I'm spending money to be served what I ordered. I didn't want to complain because it was extremely loud & they wouldn't have heard anyhow, but I feel a need to put this out there! The bartender made a snarky comment at my decision to order a margarita then proceeded to serve me some concoction of pineapple juice & lime mixer. Pretty sure there was NO tequila in that one! Needless to say I walked out of Bevvy with 3 drinks in me but sober. I had fun dancing with my friends so there's an extra star for that, but I left irritated at the bartenders and asshole security guards who spoke to me like I was 3 when leaving from the restroom. It was 2:04am... I won't be returning to this shitty embarrassing establishment.",

She insulted our choice of tequila saying that \"we shouldn't order it if we couldn't pronounce it.\" My friends and I are from New Mexico, let's just say we know our tequila and how to pronounce it. She then proceed to tell me that \"I don't give you salt unless you ask for it.\" The worst part of this experience was that the manager was standing RIGHT BEHIND ME the entire time. When I asked him why he didn't intervene, he told me that \"he had no idea this was going on.\" Needless to say, we will never come back here and I have told the Scottsdale party bike tour to never recommend this bar to anyone. It's sad to know that places like this treat customers this way.",

While it's in \"the circle\" of the entertainment district, it tends to be moderately more chill than it's neighbors (Bottled, District, Hefe, Etc.) My favorite thing about this place used to be the check-in offer for a rubber ducky shot, but I think they've changed it to be a ride on some kid's toy that they keep on the sidewalk outside of the bar. (Bummer.)  As to the atmosphere, it's pretty crazy on the weekends, and on Thursday nights, they do trivia, which is actually pretty entertaining, chill and fun! I've never consumed anything solid here, so I can't speak to their food, but the drinks are pretty standard. Service is better here than at a lot of the places in Old Town, and they've got a few fun bar games. If the rubber duckies make a comeback, I probably will too. As silly as it was, it was my favorite thing about this place because everyone was surprised by and loved it!",

If you're looking for a place to dress casual but want to dance and have a good time, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO!

Our server is MIA .. oh wait, she's taking pics and hugging on some dude , no worries, we'll wait. 14.

It permeated the entire establishment even though the entire east wall was open to the patio. It created headaches for all of us. It is absolutely disgusting and we've never encountered something like it. It was so powerful I'm guessing it's a scent they add thru the air handler. It must be stopped.  The drinks are served in plastic glasses.  Happy hour offers good discounts on drinks and food. The burger and side for $5 on HH is a bargain and tasty, however the \"red relish\" is sweet and doesn't jive - had to remove the top bun to finish.   The chicken salad was the highlight and the citrus dressing is great.  It came out well before the other items however.  The steak salad was terrible. The steak was extremely tough/chewy and almost uneatable. Asked for steak knife...\"sorry, we don't have them.\"  Menu says it comes with \"roasted tomatoes.\"  Wrong. Try halved grape tomatoes. Also, there was no \"Texas toast crouton.\"  Just a couple small bits of avocado too. The blue cheese dressing was good.  Anyone paying full price for this ($14) should be ashamed of themselves.  The $2.5 loaded popcorn was a bargain and tasty.  One skeeball machine was out of order.  Female bartender finished her shift/passed us off to next bartender without so much as a word. New server was very unobservant, though the place was mostly empty.  Overall, between the perfumey air pollution and less than acceptable food/service, I left disappointed and smelly.",

I feel like every night you have a bar in mind to either start with or to hit it up for the duration of that night, and Bevvy can be either.  I typically go to Bottled when I want to hit up a faux Zedd concert; District if I am too far gone but still wanna have  a good time; and Bevvy if I want the option of doing both.   It really doesn't matter what time of day you go. If you go during the hour of wolf, you will most likely have to push and shove to get a drink. But most of the time you can get a drink in a timely manner, and also play some of the games. They got Jenga and Connect Four. (Kick down all Jenga's, but only if you're cool with the peeps.)  It's got some bomb ass food too. You can also hit this place up for lunch too.   Bevvy is that person in your life that keeps you grounded. Bevvy is the one you can always come back to and it's like nothing changed. Bevvy is the bae of bars.",

Upon entering you cant help but notice the sunken bar and the great light fixtures, which made it bright but not in a bad way.  They have tvs everywhere and when you are sitting in a booth you always have a great view.  The patio is large and dog friendly and with tvs so you can watch the big game.    The Happy Hour is really quite amazing for an Old Town Scottsdale location.  $5 Burger and a side, 1/2 off all appetizers AND salads, $3 beer and well drinks from 4-7!!!  The menu has a great variety of bar food and also healthier options which I really appreciate.  We tried the popcorn which is made with bacon fat and has crisp bacon pieces throughout, OMG so good.  The house made red pepper hummus and veggies was delicious, slightly chunky and really fresh veggies.  The wings looked good but I didnt try them.  I had a Bevvy Salad which had chicken, goat cheese dates and the freshest pieces of avocado I have ever had at a restaurant.  It was large enough to share and at $7 a real bargain and very yummy.  They offer weekend brunch with mimosas and bloody marys and a variety of dishes for $10 each, I am looking forward to trying it out.  There are 2 large Jenga games, a large Connect Four, a mini shuffleboard and a photo booth in the back of the restaurant as well.  The owner, Lauren, is very kind and you can just tell she loves her restaurant and cares what each patron thinks good or bad, so say hi when you go in!  Looking forward to coming back many more times and bringing friends.",

They were understaffed (obvious). Our first table we sat at no one acknowledged us so we moved to the bar which was still very slow. We sat with empty drinks at the bar and waited for someone to acknowledge us so we could get our check and leave which took an additional 30 min. There was no official bartender as wait staff was serving tables as well. This is official Spring Training season so staff appropriately please.",

She made me feel so uncomfortable. Hope you get run over by a truck :)",

After 45 minutes of ordering she had told us that it would still be about 20 more minutes. When I asked why it was going to take so long she said it was because she did not put the ticket in until about 15 minutes before. As a waitress myself that is unacceptable. The next time she came around she changed her story as told me it was because I got a well done burger. I know that a well done burger does not take a full hour to cook. By the time we got our food my friends food was very cold and the manager said he would take off her food and my drink. I just checked my credit card statement after remembering it was only $17. They ended up charging me the full price of the bill. I'm not even sure if that's legal. Definitely not coming here again.",

Great music, great energy and cool international vibe.    Bevvy's bartenders / waitresses are both good looking and interested in holding a conversation - unlike most of old town..   Food was great!  Had the half chicken / half salmon, teriyaki / sweet chili rice bowl. My girlfriend had the Steak Salad and was impressed all round. They have everything from typical bar food (chicken fingers and steak fries) to chef inspired dishes.   This place is so well rounded. You get a little bit of everything. Great place to hang out for hours and play one of many games including, (Darts, Jenga, Skee Ball, Shuffle-Board). Bevvy interacts with its guests offering discounts and prizes when we reach high scores on their games. Super Fun!  They even have horse race betting, I believe they call it Off Track Betting...   I'll definitely be back. Finally a place in the heart of the Entertainment District that offers it all!  While holding a conversation with bartender, Aubree, I was informed that they have live music on thursdays, and also a phenomenal brunch on the weekends.",

We ended up joining in on their fun and playing Jenga with them. We enjoyed the music playing here... It was alternative hits mixed with classic rock hits beyond just modern day tunes. Lots of sing-a-longs which are totally okay with us especially with a good ol' buzz. Our server's name was Ioanna, and she was very sweet. We never waited longer than a couple minutes without drinks and she definitely is the reason we sat on the patio for as long as we did. The food was excellent. We ate the house poppers and they were great. Our chicken sandwich and burger were cooked perfectly. They also have this stuff called carrot ketchup which is really tasty and unique. Try this place out, you won't be disappointed.",

There was no reason for the food to come out an hour and a half after we ordered it it was not busy we even saw three other tables take their food to go once it came out because there's took so long. we finally get the bill and and a total amazement my boyfriend and I spent $80 between the two of us for lunch we each had two drinks and a meal that was ridiculous. one of our drinks that we had was The Angry Orchard on tap with a shot of Fireball and it. the shot of Fireball cost us $9 and some change that is insane any other bar I've been to his only charged $5 for a shot but when it's mixed in with the Angry Orchard beer were usually charged $9 for the beer with the shot combined in. but these guys charge just almost $17 for the drink. I will never ever come back to this place again it was absolutely horrible. total disappointment expecially after raving about it to my friends and then going through such horrible service.",
