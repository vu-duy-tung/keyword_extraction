    "text": "First of all, the food was adequate nothing to write home about. They put avocados in the Uni which I found to be odd and covered up the flavor. The  soft shell crab appetizer as well as the sweet shrimp were both delicious. The meal on the whole was all right but we were unable to finish because of the service.The  service, on the other hand was an entirely different thing. Our waitress when we walked in to a restaurant with only two tables eating asked us to see ourselves. After we set ourselves and waited for about 5 to 6 minutes we got our own menus and begin to look over the menu and select some sushi items at least another five minutes went by and she said oh I'm sorry would you like something to drink. As if that was not bad enough after our meal I watched our waitress who had an obvious cold sore on her upper lip carrying a plate of food in her left hand to another  table scratching, or playing with her nose near  her lip with her right hand, as she approached the table put the plate in her right hand and served it to that couple with that contaminated hand. I found to be unsanitary and disgusting. While the other two people in my party we're discussing ordering more food I had to draw their attention to our waitress where she then again began to play with her nose again so I asked for the bill. She then brought us the bill after 20 minutes and one of my companions had to get up and remind her for the bill. When she finally brought it over she again was playing with her nose carrying fortune cookies and a paper receipt for us, disgusting!",

There are so many rolls to choose from, and with the discounts, they were all very affordable.  We used to go to an all you can eat sushi restaurant and ended up paying $26 a person (which was totally worth it because we eat a lot of sushi). At Iron Chef, our tab with quite a few rolls and 1 beer each was $30 total. We were stuffed!",

I would pass on the cucumber salad- it was essentially tossed in sugar water- extremely sweet. The rest of the food was good. The miso was excellent and the sushi was fresh. I had an eel roll- but it didn't have much eel in it, although it was still delicious. We also ordered the spicy yellowtail, also good but nothing to write home about. If you are in the area, definitely get some rolls to go. Also, they have a permanent \"40% off rolls\" printed on top of their menu- so I would recommend giving them a chance while this promotion still stands! All in all, quality sushi for Phoenix.",

They're open late, great prices, excellent selection of rolls and other items. I can come here and order sushi while the people I'm with can order off the Chinese menu. I know this may not be authentic, but it allows for variety when dining with picky eaters.  I had a salmon/tuna/mango roll that was so good - had just enough sweetness with the fruit. Also had a shrimp tempura roll with tuna in soy paper. Interesting combination that was very tasty.  Their happy hour is great and I believe they are open everyday except Christmas (or maybe New Years - can't remember). It's an awesome local place to hang out. Small and casual where they make you feel right at home!",

The gyoza was delicious and would definitely order again! The calamari was disappointing. I am used to smaller pieces but they served about five massive pieces of squid. It was so chewy that by the time I got through the squid, all the breading fell off. I would not recommend. We each ordered a few rolls, the sashimi is great. I was not impressed with the fried rolls, the rice became dense and dry in the fried rolls and I have had better elsewhere. The other rolls, chef's specials were delicious! I will most likely be back due to their outrageously good prices, but will choose my rolls more wisely.",

I order a corona,  she brings it back, slams it, and an on the rocks glass next to my husband and diagnal from me...  Not to me....  She still has no smile, and never did.    The Rangoon was brought with the rolls.  Not as an appetizer.  She keeps coming back every 5 minutes to try and get us to close out the tab.  I couldn't eat fast enough to get out of there.    If you are ok with good food and the most non friendly service ever, then this place is for you.  However, Service is very important to me, so for this reason only...  We will never go back.",

I could sit here and complain but it comes down to this: inconsistent quality. The service and atmosphere are always 5/5 however I always have to second guess what I order for fear that it won't be as good as the last time I had it. I've noticed a change in the servers over a year but I unfortunately never got to meet the chef's so I can't say for sure if they've changed too.",

Their wine and beer prices were super cheap, but would have been even cheaper if we weren't using the coupon (can't be used in conjunction with their awesome happy hour prices). We ordered the spicy tuna, Philadelphia, Tiffany, Phoenix, spicy salmon, and Arizona rolls. Our waiter informed us that appetizers are 99 cents if you order a roll, so we got an order of edamame, gyoza, spring rolls, and crab puffs. He walked away and I immediately began freaking about how tiny my stomach is versus the amount of food we just ordered. I figured I should maybe stop drinking my wine to save room for the sushi. Spoiler alert: I didn't.  Our appetizers came out and they were small and standard tasting, which we were okay with since they weren't even a dollar each. But our sushi came out and WOAH. Looking delicious atop a large bridge with a glowing plastic ice cube in the middle, I could barely get a picture before we started in on it all. The fish tasted fresh and, even more importantly, I could actually taste the fish. I can't tell you how many times I've gone places that do a Philly roll with a little bit of salmon and a LOT of cucumber and cream cheese. Iron Chef did not disappoint. The flavors complimented each other nicely in their Phoenix, Tiffany, and Arizona rolls especially.   We did note that their wasabi really lacked the normal spiciness. My friend spent so long adding more and more wasabi to his soy sauce, trying to get to his normal heat, that I nearly Hoovered all his rolls.   In the end, when the others gave up on their sushi, I finished it. All. Next time, we're coming back during happy hour. I want more of that Tiffany roll.",

There are definitely other places in the area which serve higher quality fish, but unless you are a sushi snob, you likely won't be disappointed in the flavors and quality. They also have a lot of fun combos. I never thought I would enjoy salmon + mango, but it's really nice! Also, bowls that are on fire usually serves for fun conversations with nearby diners.   Con: slow service. I will admit, I've waited a bit for service and food. However, I don't necessarily mind. My friend and I are always in good conversation and so we don't push for immediate service. Enjoy the social hour and fun food!",

    "text": "A friend and I eat here often and we feel as though service has been lacking as of late. Usually service is up to par but this time was the last time we will eat here. We normally order the same things over so when she brought out an appetizer we don't normally order I was very confused. She must have misunderstood what we wanted. We ordered an angry edamame and she brought back fried calamari? She then came back and we ordered an angry edamame and she repeated okay angry edamame but ended up bringing us back a regular edamame.. My friend and I were debating if we should return it and ask for the angry edamame but we both knew that if we had returned it that she was just gonna take it back and add the chili flakes to it and guess what? That's exactly what she did! Since the regular edamame already has salt on it it came back SUPER SALTY and we couldn't even eat it. We felt bad for returning it so we just kept it. It DID NOT taste like angry edamame and lacked the chili oil that's usually in it. The Chinese food we ordered didn't taste good at all,the sauce was disgusting and for the fact that the owners are Chinese I was very disappointed. When we were ready to pay we had then told her that we did not order the fried calamari. She was confused and said okay and took it off the bill (again we felt bad, but it was her misunderstanding, was it not?) After all this happened we finally got home and my friend got SUPER sick, which was really weird because she didn't really eat much. She knows for a fact that it was Iron chef because she hadn't eaten anything at all that day. TMI but she had massive diarrhea for hours. We normally don't order sushi here because their sushi is of super low quality and is often times disappointing. I know what good quality sushi is because I've worked in 6 sushi restaurants here in Arizona all of top notch quality. I would pay the extra money for sushi not to get sick any day.",

Started with our miso soup full of tofu.  It was salty (as expected) but good.  Next was the cucumber salad.  The flavor was good but the cukes  were swimming in all the rice vinegar.  It could have been better if the cukes were julienned rather than sliced.  Our sushi came out before the edamame.  We got the salmon roll and our specialty roll was salmon, tuna, & white fish.  Tasty and fresh.  The way they broke down the bill was odd.  Usually they show what you owe but in this case, they had all the prices of the sushi along with the total.  It was confusing leading my husband to question what the tip should be.  Just the bottom line total would be better folks.  Plenty of parking.  Sorry the photos are red, their lighting has a lot to do with it.",

    "text": "Iron Chef might be more like 3.5 stars, but I would need to try it a few more times to say for sure. I ordered 10 or so rolls for pickup for a group. Everything was packed away neatly with soy sauce and chopsticks included. The fish seemed pretty fresh, between the salmon, yellowtail and tuna. The reason why I've given three stars as opposed to four is that the rice didn't have enough vinegar and it was a little bit on the sweeter side. Also, the chef speciality rolls ($10-14), while more expensive were the same size as the normal rolls ($4-8) and usually they are different sizes at other places I've been to. I would try Iron Chef again and then update my review.",

Anyway, the people in my party were wanting AYCE and so they had to call this place to make sure they offered it and they said they do. They gave the wrong price over the phone though. The man on the phone said $21. When we arrived they only gave us the regular menu and we had to specifically request the AYCE menu. The menu said the price was actually $24.95. The menu is VERY limited as well as you can see by the photo.   Food was just OK. Nothing special. The sashimi was very warm. Gyoza was probably the best tasting item we got. Crab ragoons were another good item on the menu. The regular rolls were very tiny and the specialty rolls are the better option if sushi rolls are what you're looking for.",

We went yesterday for lunch we asked for a high chair and expected that she would get it for us. But she decided to go eat in her little corner by the bathroom instead of help us.  When our food was ready she would place it in front of our 2 year old who will grab not knowing if it'll be hot or not. She was not friendly. When she brought us our rolls she would say what it was,  but we could not understand what she would mumble and say quietly. Great job to great food,  but some of your staff need evaluation on their poor services",

My boyfriend and I go here almost twice a week and sometime more. This is like our second home lol.. Every time we dine here the sushi is always consistently superb and the presentation looks great too! Plus one of the waitress know us so well that we don't even have to tell her what we need at times. She is one exceptionally awesome waitress. Lately, we decided to branch out and try their Chinese food entree and wow, their house chowmein is mind blowing. The sauce was so yummy. Like I said, their prices is so reasonable for their roll and quality of the food is awesome-- I would give this place 10 stars.   P.s.. the place is kinda small for dining.. but it's very clean and weekend crowd can be hectic. I just noticed the outside patio MIGHT be dog friendly cause I saw someone brought a dog.",

I ordered the shrimp tempura (good, but it's from the freezer. They were good like how bagel bites are good.), yellowtail sashimi (buttery, smooth, fresh to death), tamago nigiri (again I think this was premade, but still enjoyable, not old), unagi nigiri (do you ever order eel and it tastes kind of musky? This had a musky flavor), yellowtail and scallion roll, spicy yellowtail roll, and a Boston roll. Again all the yellowtail was superb. The sushi rice was nicely seasoned and not too mushy, not too hard. The Boston roll was good as well. In addition the beer is cheap, and my server was very friendly and nice. And am I weird to like the neon signs and crooning Korean music playing? Overall, a nice meal :)",

Hot dishes are another good option, though we generally stick to the vegetable tempura, and the staff is kind and efficient.

I went at 8pm when all of their sushi rolls are half off with no restrictions unless of course you have a groupon. This clearly was not stated anywhere until of course I got my 40 dollar full price bill for sushi. They said they have a notice posted when you walk in stating the rule for groupons.  Clearly anyone walking in would not see it until the waitress pointed it out. It was a small little piece of paper in the corner of the window in small print. I sucked it up and just paid since I already paid for the groupon and the sushi was decent considering the area is lacking any kind of real sushi joint.  Then I made the mistake of returning again for sushi a 2nd time. Again big sign stating half off all sushi, all day. I ordered three rolls all off the sushi menu with big bold letters stating half off ALL SUSHI ROLLS. When I got the bill the rolls were not half off as stated clearly on the menu. I asked the waitress what the deal was and she, \"oh we just changed it so its only 50% off certain rolls.\". I asked her how anyone would know that , and she just smiled and shrugged her shoulders. Good way to lose customers such as me.",

I actually almost didn't make it in, but they let me in since I was inside the door before 9:30.  I would have been mad if they didn't let me in because I was flying on the Beeline and almost hit a fox on the way up here.  My friend and I ordered several assortments of sushi and some sake.  We enjoyed our food to a spectacular Game 6 World Series game.  The server and sushi chef didn't mind that we wanted to stay until the game was over.  We just kept ordering more drinks!  Overall, we had a great experience with the quality of our food and the fun atmosphere to watch a game.",

It's a small restaurant but we've never had to wait for a seat even though they seem really busy most of the time.  They have a lil patio area if you want to sit outside.    The food is pretty good especially for the price... It's happy hour all the time... Everyday.  My favorite roll is the Yummy Yummy... I know they have more than just sushi... They have a Chinese and Japanese cuisine but I've only had the sushi and some appetizers.  One day I'll try something different.    The service is ok... I would advise to be patient when they are busy... I'm usually not in a hurry and not impatient so I can care less if the service isn't the best... I go there for the food and the price.  Which is above average... And that's what matters to me.",

We ordered 4 rolls: spicy tuna, avocado eel,  a deep fried one with peanuts and a samurai roll which consisted of a bunch of fish wrapped in seaweed. They ranged from bland to average.

As said in previous reviews, the restaurant was FILTHY. None of the tables were bused and someone had spilled a whole plate of sushi on the floor. The waitress apologized for the mess. We sat at the only unoccupied cleanish table and ordered tea. Soon we realized that no one was cleaning up the mess!!! The manager, who looked semi-homeless in his backwards baseball cap sat right next to the mess and counted money with his calculator, right there in the open.The waitress walked by all the disgusting tables empty-handed time after time. Eventually, she brought out a broom and dustpan and placed it next to the mess on the floor, but never cleaned it! We debated whether to leave, but ordered some sushi to see if anyone would clean anything before we left. Nope. Manager finished counting money and watching a playoff game and walked out. This disastrous excuse for a restaurant looked the same as the minute we walked in! I posted a couple of pics of this.  It's too bad because the tea and sushi were okay, but I felt like I was eating in a garbage dump.",

If you buy a groupon, don't be a cheapo and expect that the sushi half off will apply to you and then you can also get to apply your groupon. How do you expect these people to live?  Outside of the misers that are reviewing this restaurant everybody should know the following: 1) The sushi is amazing. I have seen some really innovative stuff. 2) The owners are amazing. They are super friendly and, if you have children, they are kind to your children. It is not every day that you find that in a sushi restaurant.  3) They will accommodate you. If you are a sushi fanatic like myself and like something that is not on the menu, ask and you shall receive. All of these reasons combine to make this my FAVORITE sushi place in Phoenix.",

I've never found bones in my sushi before. So disappointing as we paid for the all-you-can-eat and could barely finish our first platter of sushi.

The hand roll was ok, but the seaweed it was wrapped in was soggy and gross, so I had to eat everything out of it was a fork. The Tuna roll was also just OK and seemed as little soggy and old rather than crispy. It did have spice to it, but with the sogginess I still couldn't really eat it. Everything was just a mess and I was so disappointed that I spent $25 on food that i ended up not enjoying so I didn't eat it. I would not go back for a second chance despite the reviews.",

Inside, you can catch whatever game is on and how can you beat $4 saki ? The kids like it too- California Rolls, Orange  Chicken, LoMein. Located @ Tatum & Shea in the Whole Foods shopping center. Take the to go menu because- they deliver!",

    "text": "We went out with some friends tonight and tried Iron Chef.  The table was pleasant although on one side our friends were sitting on a bench and the other side my wife and I sat on chairs.  The tables are right next to each other so you always feel that you have to be extra careful what you say.  My wife ordered a shrimp dish that was okay - not great. One of us ordered some chicken dish that he liked but it didn't present well.   Two of us ordered sweet and sour chicken. I didn't even know how to react when it arrived. It was a plate of what looked like dry, fried flat chicken tenders from MacDonalds (I'm not sure but I suspect these were frozen) along with some carrot slices (I asked for no onions). There was no pineapple or anything else. Just dry, plain chicken tenders along with a small cup of brown rice that was tasteless. It just didn't look like sweet and sour chicken at all.  The waitress gave us each a small flat bowl that she poured a little sweet and sour sauce into.  I poured it over the chicken but it wasn't even close to enough. I asked for more and got another little dish of sauce and that wasn't enough. Then we realized that the sweet and sour sauce was very watery and just wasn't going to add any flavor to the dish. It was disappointing.  My wife and I, not realizing that there was a little cup of brown rice with the dish, also ordered chicken fried rice. It was a big plate of flavorless rice with a bunch of very dry chicken slices in it.  It was flavorless, especially the chicken slices which again, looked like a frozen product because the slices were cut perfectly uniform.    Sorry, but I'm not a fan of eating what I suspect was frozen flavorless chicken with watery, tasteless sauce  The people on either side of us were eating sushi and seemed to enjoy it.  Conclusion - if you want sushi, without a sushi bar, this place is okay.  If you want other asian food, be careful.",

There is nowhere in Arizona you can come to get fresh, restaurant-served sushi this cheap. Almost all rolls are either 40-50% off. Not to mention, their sushi is amazing! They have sooooo many different combinations to choose from- many I have never seen anywhere else. Everyone HAS to try their deep fried sushi. It's to die for.   I am so sad to see all the bad reviews (which seems to be over some kind of groupon fiasco). The restaurant is adorable, the servers have always been great, and like I said above, you won't find sushi this delicious AND this cheap anywhere else in Arizona.",

I asked if they could sub 2 more pcs of sashimi instead of the roll and they had no problem with it.  The fish was fresh and tasty.  The miso soup it came with was also good.  The ice tea I had was good as well.  All in all, a great stop, and I would come again if I were in the area.",

Our coupon was for the sushi menu only, so we got some miso soup and a seaweed salad to start. Miso always tastes the same to me, and this was no different. The salad had a nice flavor and had . But what really impressed us were the two specialty rolls we ordered, the Arizona and the Sunshine. Both were excellent! We were really surprised and pleased that they were so good!  It had been a long and arduous day for the both of us, so we didnt stop with the sushi. We went on to split an order of Mongolian beef. We actually ordered everything at once, so it sounded like a good idea, but ended up being a ton of food. The beef dish was excellent, despite how full we were by the time it arrived. There was just enough spice to the really great sauce.   The thing I didnt like was the decor. We sat at a patio table that was inside and there was a television directly above my head that was quite distracting. The food and the service made up for it in my opinion. I plan on adding Iron Chef to our rotation of dinner and/or take out spots. I even grabbed a to go menu on the way out!",

Today was looking for somewhere to eat for lunch & noticed this on Google Maps & remembered I wanted to try it. Went to their website to see their menu & they had a wide variety of chinese & japanese food. You can even order online & even have it delivered if its after a certain time. Decided to go there & get the food to go. Took 10mins or less to have my order ready.  Ordered their lunch chicken chow mein combo which comes with chicken fried rice & 1 eggroll & 1 crab rangoon along with the chicken chow mein.  The chow mein was excellent! They didn't put to many veggies or other weird items like some other chinese places do. Fried rice was a bit bland but when eaten with the other food it made up for the bland taste.  Eggroll was delicious as well. Looks to be a veggie roll which I don't typically like but it reminds me of Yogis Grill eggrolls which are very similar & delicious as well.",

They may speak their native language but they also speak English well which especially in a non Asian state like Arizona, if you don't speak English, then you should not be in the service industry. They have a full staff for the small size of their restaurant and all of them communicate well and work harmoniously together. It's really a great sight to see how well they communicate. Like they are all friends. The food is just fantastic. I've ate a lot of sushi. And these sushi chefs sure know how to make sushi rice and roll a sushi roll correctly. They pack in a decent size of amount of fish and the best part is they know how to pack it in tight!! That means even if you aren't well practiced in chopsticks, you will be able to pick up the largest of rolls without it spilling over. I got the samurai roll which has three different types of fish in it, making it an exceptionally slippery roll and these sushi chefs rolled it so well that even after I bit into the roll it didn't fall apart!!! It's a miracle I tell ya! And even their presentation is nice for the sushi! They are just that good!!  The kitchen food is just as good. My friend ordered kung pao chicken and i don't normally like that dish but the chicken was cooked to the perfect consistency I couldn't help but steal a few pieces for myself. Overall this is one of the best restaurants I have visited. They do everything well.",

So far I have been three times but you can bet if I lived any closer I would probably be here every week. They have a nice sized selection of veggie rolls, all of which I have tried. They are simple, but the avocado rolls, and the sweet potato tempura rolls are by far my favorite. The rolls are also nicely sized themselves. I never leave here hungry for sure. The last time we were here, we ordered so many rolls that they brought them all out on a bridge! It was pretty awesome.  The service is really great as well. Everyone who works here is really friendly.   If you haven't been here yet, try it. Vegetarians and fish lovers all will be happy with the selection here.",

So we arrive at close to 9p to find the place is still in full swing and serving until 10:30 even on a Tuesday!   They have a near special that is but a drink get $2 app so we ordered the crab Rangoon and spring roll both of which were nicely crunchy and made just right.   Hubby ordered the Kung Pao  and subbed low mein noodles for the rice. Portioning was significant and had the kick he was looking for.   I ordered to sushi rolls.... Found a spot in my top three for these guys! They have a HUGE list of chef specials that are unique or take a unique spin on the traditional. The SUPER volcano was AMAZING! Nice sauce, huge topping of crab, AND it was served with a lovely fire in the middle of the plate. Talk about presentation. The other was Snow White which I got for the heat and it delivered.  Service was prompt and our wait attendant was very accommodating.",

    "text": "My first visit here was in October of last year, for my DD's birthday, and we dined in.  It was early afternoon and the small restaurant was fairly empty, so we were attended to quickly.   I got the Vegetable Tempura appetizer, which included broccoli (which I love), and mushrooms (which I despise), along with other veggies. I gave the mushrooms to the birthday girl, who also got the Spring Rolls appetizer.  Both appetizers were good. The tempura was nice and light; not greasy or oily at all. And the portion was huge.    So, besides the appetizers, what's a vegan to eat at a sushi bar? Veggie rolls!  There's a Vegetarian Roll section on the Japanese menu. Mushi mushi! Arigato!  My vegan order:  AVOCADO ROLL:  stuffed with fresh avocado & rice, and wrapped in the naturally plant-based nori. (Does not have rice surrounding the outer parts of the roll.)  TOFU SKIN & AVOCADO ROLL:  1st of all, I didn't know that tofu had skin. Secondly, it's delicious! It's firm (not mushy) and the combination with avocado and the rice is very flavorful. The rice is on the outside of this roll. This is my favorite item here.   There were 8 pieces per roll.  They come with wasabi and ginger, which are both always fresh, and a yummy accompaniment to my veggie rolls.   (Vegans who are sensitive to cross-contamination may want voice your concerns and make special requests. I did not see them switch up preparation areas or utensils. My food has never tasted \"fishy,\" but...just so you know.)  DD loves the Crunchy Shrimp Tempura Roll & the Shrimp Avocado Roll. She also gets 8 pieces per roll.  All of our rolls were 50% off the regular menu price. I think this discount varies, based on which rolls you get.  They have other veg*n options, like Teriyaki Tofu & a veggie Udon noodle dish, which I'd love to try one day.  We now frequent Iron Chef, but we mostly do carry-out orders. We still get the 50% off though. There is a dedicated carry-out parking space located in front of their door, which is extremely helpful during peak times, when the parking lot is jam-packed.  The employees are always very nice, and they package my veggie rolls separately from the meat rolls.  They also give you a free drink with your to-go order, which is pretty sweet.   There's a patio dining area outside its front doors.  The inside is dimly lit in the evenings; nice for a date night.",

It seems like more of a takeout place than a sit-down restaurant. We sat at the bar and the service was efficient, if not very friendly. Foodwise, we had the fried calamari, a shrimp tempura sushi roll and a crab avocado roll. The calamari was in large and VERY chewy  pieces...weirded me out a little, but my companion enjoyed it. The mayo-based sauce that came with it  was really good. We both enjoyed the crab avocado roll, and the shrimp tempura roll was lacking a little flavor but still pretty good. Overall the food was ok, but didn't care for the service or the feel of the place. In the future, if I want sushi/Japanese, I'll probably just head up the street to Shogun.",

We also ordered a roll since it was half off. Sakana makes the same roll way better. My chicken tasted ok, however 4 hours later I had food poisoning.

It's not that big of a location compared to Shugun Sushi right up the street so it will be interesting to see how much traffic they get. It's definitely in my rotation now. Have never been a fan of Sushi Bistro down the street and its $20.00 rolls.  ****update  Ive been twice and I'm bumping them up to a 5. The happy hour menu even expanded.",

When I presented the certificate to the waitress I was told it was not good anymore.  I pointed out there was no expiration date on it and she got the manager who came over with a pen and started underlining things on the certificate.  At this time I told him we would find another restaurant and we got up and left.  Do not go to this restaurant because they will try to talk you out of using gift certificates, coupons etc. Very few people there on A Saturday night at 7:00.  This should tell you something about the food and service.",

    "text": "The fish was pretty fresh and the rolls were the perfect size to be able to fit into your mouth without looking like a blowfish... but it was just missing that... something.  We tried a large spread of appetizers, sashimi and rolls...  it was good, but it wasn't great.  I'll only comment on a few of the things we ordered to give the gist:  The spicy tuna wasn't spicy at all.  The shrimp on the rainbow roll tasted a little old and chewy.  Most of their rolls with crab have imitation Krab, which they don't tell you, but you can figure it out based upon the prices of the roll that has real crab and specifically states it is real crab.  Our server forgot to bring out miso soup all together, so I don't know how that is.  The crab rangoon was pretty good and had a great sauce.  The yellowtail and jalapeno appetizer missed the mark... I've had it before in other places where it was amazing, so this was a little disappointing.  And the Philly roll had no cucumber and was pretty much all cream cheese, which while I like a good amount, not being able to taste the salmon or anything else isn't appealing.  Some of the pieces of fish were pretty good sized, while others were very lacking - there seemed to be an inconsistency.  If I were in the neighborhood and really hungry for sushi, I might try it again as the prices were pretty decent and they seemed to have a local following, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there for sushi as the experience was a little underwhelming.",

I made the mistake of ordering oysters tonight they took twenty minutes to come out. The lady saw me confused as to why I was waiting so long and told me they had just been taken out of the freezer and needed to defrost. At this point I told her if they are not ready I don't want them ( who wants oysters that are defrosted then topped with some chopped onions and some slimy gross tasting yellow muck). She says they are coming right out. They were by far the worst oysters I have ever had. Thinking the taste was from the horrible preparation, disappointed, and disgusted I ate them anyway out of pure starvation. The lady never checked on me to see how it was left my water empty for most the meal and then asked if we wanted anything else. All I wanted was to get out of there I payed the 16.40 and left. I felt sick on the way home and when I got home immediately threw up everything I ate. I called back to complain and let them know the seafood they were serving is not safe. The manager did not care at all about the fact the oysters were sick and only after more complaining offered me a ten dollar credit. Are you f****ing kidding me so I just payed 6 dollars at your restaurant to puke and now I have to come back for the shit food and service another day. Ya right this place is disgusting! I will never eat there again and neither should you lol",

Place is nice, service is EXCELLENT, food presentation follows, but quality of the food itself is where everything falls apart.   My friend and I ordered two lemon drop martini...that tasted like LEMONADE!! I swear, there was no alcohol whatsoever in those. So we had to get a shot of vodka to compensate. I'm not sure if my friend got charged for it. I bet our waitress figured immediately why we needed it. No wonder. Perhaps someone else had the same issue.   Next, the Tuna Tataki appetizer was the worst of the dishes. I understand how valuable tuna is, so why don't you serve fresh tuna and charge a bit more? NO doubt, that tuna was frozen and old.  The sushi itself was not evil, but neither the best we have ever had (Tokyo and Tiger rolls)   Wonton soup was delicious, one of my favorite soups and dessert (banana tempura) was good. (The green tea ice cream tasted just like a ball of sugar, no flavor of the green tea, but that's the least).   I guess the Tuna app and the sushi itself is why I might try other places as far as Japanese cuisine. Too bad cause the service was impeccable, and the atmosphere cozy, but down to the quality of food, a disappointment.",

I'm from Los Angeles so I've had my fair share of tasting sushi and this just didn't cut it. It tasted like it was premade days ago and just taken out of a fridge and served to us.

Even on a Wednesday nice to see this little Chinese/Japanes sushi spot filled with customers! From the start our server was outstanding with our group of 10 and attentive to our needs. I recommend the won ton egg drop soup as starter! The main meal consisted of  a plate of salmon avocado roll, scallion yellowtail roll and spicy shrimp avocado roll. The rolls were very tasty and fresh! If you don't know me by now I am a huge ice tea enthusiast and the unsweet ice tea had a hint of green tea which I like! I will be back for sure and excited to try the sushi menu!",

    "text": "I would definitely eat here again!  I only give it four stars because of service (see below).   The food: FABULOUS!  I loved the Gyoza and it was supposed to be an order of 6. They first brought only 5. Before I could say something the waitress returned with three more to make up for it!  We also got three rolls, the Yummy Yummy was our favorite!  The name says it all!  And the fish tasted fresh and we could see the guys behind the counter rolling things as they were ordered. There is no counter to sit at FYI. Someone in the group got the house fried rice and they were very generous with all the meat in it!  He did think it needed a good bit of soy sauce for his liking but he said he'd order it again. General Tso's was spicy (and my husband can take spice and he didn't ask for extra). He did ask for extra crispy on the chicken and they did that perfectly. The hot and sour soup was very flavorful and full of veggies!  Not just the egg and bamboo shoots as usual everyone liked it. And the portion for a \"cup\" was large. The kids sweet and sour chicken was very generous portion size too and the sauce comes separately. Which we appreciated for our picky eater.    Service:  We were a group of five and went on a Friday night about 6:30. So prime time I know. However we did call about 15 minutes prior to going and \"reserved\" a table. I use quotes as this isn't a place that really seems to take reservations but it is a small place about 20 tables in total (including the 8 outside) so if you have more than 4 people I'd give them a heads up. When we arrived there were maybe 4 empty tables and when we said we'd called they showed us to one immediately.  They had a 4 top and 2 top pushed together but when they saw one was a child they coerced us into letting them remove the two top and putting a chair at the end. This persons chair backed up to the two top so not ideal. And the people at the two top had a Great Dane with them (we were inside). It wasn't clear that this was a service dog, maybe he was in training but for a while he was sitting on the bench seat next to the woman. We love dogs we own one, but being in such close quarters and trying to have dinner this wasn't a preferred situation.  Also they bring you the food when it is ready!  So the traditional \"order\" of things wasn't really followed. We got the edamame last. However everything that was supposed to be hot was obviously right out of the skillet/fryer and run to the table!  And they were great on keeping drinks filled. And it was a Friday evening during dinner rush.   I would definitely go again and would suggest you go!  Just don't expect much from the service but know the food will be fresh and good!",

My father in law mentioned to the waitress that he really like getting the sushi served \"on a boat\" and the waitress made sure to bring us 2 boats that were decorated and presented beautifully.  The sushi itself was very fresh and delicious. The green tea fried ice cream was also great. We've paid  double for sushi at other restaurants that was not as good as this.  One person in our party had a Chinese dish and that also was good.  We will definitely be back.  The happy hour specials are the best in the area.",

All rolls are 50% off and many other items are 40% off, and they have great drink specials.  There is also a reverse happy hour from 8-10.  I honestly need to come back because I wanted to try 20 things on the menu...they have quite an extensive menu.    I ended up ordering salmon and yellowtail hand rolls, the Golden Dragon roll and the delicious Phoenix roll! Serious melt in your mouth moments!   Everything at Iron Chef seems to have a lovely presentation in general, I was enjoying watching all the dishes come from the kitchen/sushi bar.  You can tell the spring rolls are made in house; nothing too excting to say about spring rolls but they are $2!  Super-friendly staff and a good vibe environment to add will definitely bring this sushi lover back here!",

Rainbow roll was pretty standard and okay, but the tuna roll wasn't what I expected. Rather than a roll, the tuna and fresh sliced jalapeno was spread on top of a fried tater tot-like nugget but filled with rice. It was good but I like the rolls better.  We had all of this for $30 which was a great deal.",

When it was time to pay I showed my Groupon and they would not honor it. They said some of the sushi I had was half price and they would not honor it. In fact I bought $20 worth of sushi that was not half off.   She got the manager and we go through the same argument. In fact it does not even mention it on the Groupon. So he points me to some handwritten signs posted in the restaurant. I felt they were unfair with their Groupon and the service alone should have honored the discount.   I would have given them 1 star but I had to give them credit for the quality of the food.   I'm going to post their Groupon disclosure about their half off sushi. Note. If you serve a special all day it's not happy hour.",

I've also ordered delivery and they are pretty fast! Granted I'm only 5/10 minutes away, but hey. They fudged up and gave me veggie fried rice once instead of the chow mein I had ordered, but fixed it promptly and redelivered the right order. The rice was good too, lol!  On a side note you get good discounts on sushi if you order online and go pick it up, which I will do as I'm leaving work so I can stop and go on my way home. They always give me a free drink too. I believe if you call and place an order you also get a good discount, I think it was like 40%, but that could have been a promo thing.  I recommend! Give them a try :)",

    "text": "Found Iron Chef when one of my chinese favorites was closed for vacation.  The closest chinese/fusion restaurant with lots of Yelp stars was Iron Chef.   It was a Saturday night and the place was full yet they accommodated us in less than 10 minutes.  That's pretty good.  The menu is large because they do several asian cuisines, but based on what I saw people ordering, Japanese is very popular. Sushi seemed to be on almost everyone's table.  I don't eat sushi so I looked for the chinese dishes.    I noted how inexpensive the cocktails were.  This is a place where you can down several drinks without making a dent in your wallet.   We decided to try the egg drop soup  and the egg drop/wonton soup.  The egg drop/wonton was a huge bowl enough to share. I didn't expect that.  The size could be someone's lunch portion.  My companion's egg drop was the typical sized bowl.  The soup had a good taste but the wonton's in it had thick dough and little pork inside.  I like the dough to be almost transparent with lots of pork in side (Canton Dragon makes good ones).  I ordered the mongolian beef with chicken fried rice which was a $3.75 uncharge.  Otherwise it would be a choice of white or brown rice.  My companion ordered the Orange chicken with brown rice.  My mongolian beef was spicy as I had asked, but it had too many onions and not enough beef.  The chicken fried rice had a nice flavor but not the best I have ever had.  The orange chicken was portioned nicely but the crust was a tad too heavy.  The sauce was good and not too sweet as many of these dishes tend to be.  The service was very attentive considering the crowd and there being maybe one wait staffer.  But he was good.  He was all over the place and very responsive.  Waters filled, smiles, and accommodating.   If I were a sushi lover this place would fit the bill but unfortunately raw fish is not in my future.   I may try them again for lunch if I am in the area simply because they were so attentive and reasonable priced with fairly decent fare.",

I'm a craft beer drinker so used to something with a robust flavor and kick. I should have sent it back but didn't. My bad. Next the men's room towel machine didn't work.

If you don't like wasabi flavor don't try the Phoenix roll as it has a wasabi sauce. The fried rolls were different than other rolls I have had, like a different breading batter or something - but really good. I would recommend any fried roll.  The employees are very nice and even gave my husband and I an extra to go box of noodles for free after we paid for our meal.",

The sushi rolls were probably our least favorite part of the meal.  The flavor and taste was fine, but they were a little on the dry side - not sure if that had to do with the fish, the rice, or something else.",

The sushi that contained fruit was unique and was kind of like eating poke bowls, only in a roll instead of a bowl. Only I don't normally taste banana in it, so it's different. It came out slightly slowly but that's the price of good food.  They paid for it, so the price was not an issue, but it was slow food so a tip was required.

The all you can eat sushi menu is extremely limited and I mean extremely limited for the price. (see AYCE menu pictures). They mastered how to compress a lot of rice in what ever you order and IMO the fish was as bland as can be. This is not the place for serious sushi eaters, just people whole like rolls and they have a lot of them.  That being said, the service was quick and the staff was pleasant and there are lots chefs in the kitchen, like six sushi chefs standing there in a tiny area. They also offer Chinese food and have a full menu for that. I believe it's run by Chinese but who cares, as long as everything comes out great. I wont be back. Good luck.",

Let me first start with the service. She was so friendly, quick and accommodating and was concerned that we didn't eat much of our food.   Look, we live nearby and we go top sushi places all the time and price is never an issue. We were even reluctant trying this place out as a happy hour sushi joint is not a good sign since good quality fish shouldn't be discounted.   We ordered a total of 9 dishes and kept ordering till we could find something we like. The boneless spare ribs was old, hard and awful.  The tuna martini has the lowest frozen quality Tuna. The rice on the sushi roll was old. I can go on but I will just leave it there.   I was hesitant writing this review but I wanted to do so just to ask everybody raving how good it is what they smoking or is it because they like happy hour over quality?",

She takes our drink order, brings 3/4 of it the first go around, then has to come back the 2nd time with the rest of the drink order (only 3 of us for dinner - 2 beers and 1 sake ordered with 3 waters) she proceeds to take our order (a bit of a language barrier communicating with her, but we get through it), we decide on sushi rolls/sashimi and a couple of salads and edamame to start....brings out our food, it was edible...kinda of all tasted the same and the sashimi was adequate at best.  She comes back to check on us, taking plates as quickly as she could...we actually had to stop her on a couple of them since we weren't finished yet.....a few minutes later, she's back with our check, guess we're DONE.  My husband tells her NO, we're still eating and want to possibly order more....she looks at him, smiles and walks away.....she comes back a few minutes later, determined to take our plates away...NO we're going to order something else....OK one more roll, she brings it a few minutes later, lackluster like the rest.....OK she comes back again with an updated bill and a couple of more fortune cookies, shows over for us , I guess.  Never asked if we wanted something else, dessert, drinks, a punch in the nose.....NOPE you're done , here's your tab....  Last time for this place, I hate to be rushed with my meal, especially when I'M paying for it and the fact that we're not communicating effectively makes it even more frustrating.  There is more sushi out there, I know there is and I will find it!!!!",

The soups were just ok, not the same quality as the first time, not horrible but just OK.   The sushi is where we were REALLY pissed off. $15/roll to get 6 pieces of what looks like BUDGET SUSHI. We could have gone to Yume Sushi and gotten a kick ass awesome sushi roll (or two!) for that price but apparently here, it gets you a 6 piece baked (microwaved) rice roll with hardly any other ingredients smothered in \"spicy\" (not) mayo sauce with the teensiest bit of roe sprinkled on top.   I'm not gonna lie, I TOTALLY felt downright ROBBED on this meal and I am not a happy camper about it. The food quality for the prices charged is insane.   I won't be back.",

That was a good impression to start, but then I tasted the sushi and I was blown away!  This is my favorite place for sushi in Phoenix, and it's great to hit happy hour because it's really affordable.  (though it is still worth it even when it's not happy hour)  The Samurai roll is phenomenal, as is the Rock n Roll.  My boyfriend says their chicken wings are absolutely perfect.  I can't think of anything I didn't like about them!",

    "text": "Much as I have enjoyed take out from here in the past, we had an awful experience on Christmas day. We were looking for a place that was open to go to for dinner, and called a couple of local chinese places. Iron Chef answered their phone and said they were open until 10.30. We went there around 7PM and found the place busy. We were shown to seats on the patio and waited a while to get someone's attention. It was busy, we were not in a rush and we understood. Once the menus arrived (sushi, Japanese & Chinese) we started reading and figuring out what we felt like that evening. Another 15 minutes passed until we finally flagged down a waiter, not ours apparently, who promised to send someone over to take an order.  More time passed. A giggly young lady arrived and said something in a sing-song voice that seemed to indicate that there was only sushi available and she flitted away before we could confirm what she said.  Food was being delivered to other tables around us, and the takeout order line had dissipated so we thought it would improve.  45 minutes in and getting hungry now, I flagged down another young lady who asked if we needed more time to order. We said, emphatically, that we were ready. I proceeded to list some items including some Chinese items. She wrote it all down, looked up at the ceiling in a quizzical manner, and then said that there was no Chinese food being made because they were too busy right now.  The other tables around us were being served, including what was clearly Chinese food. We were obviously not going to get anywhere with this person, so we simply got up and left, hungry and upset.  I doubt that I will ever go to this place ever again. There are many alternative asian places nearby, including competent chains like Panda Express across the road and the very good, family owned and run Golden Wok, less than a mile away",

They are always so friendly, and offer you a soft drink while you wait and will occasionally give you some soup as well.   The contents of the bags I skip out of there with are the real gem though.  Sushi: mouth watering, inventive, large rolls. Can't go wrong. I've tried most, and they are all delicious. Specifics? Go Snow White and Spicy Tuna Mango.  Food: I've only had the Singapore chow Mai fun, because it's that good. Get egg drop wonton soup with it to complete the symphony of deliciousness.   The best part? Prices that still puzzle me.

I've seen Iron Chef on Yelp before however I have never made a drive to it due to it being a ways away from my house.  On their menu they have appetizers, nigiri, sushi, and miscellaneous rolls. I would have to say that the best thing there were was the crab rangoons. That's the first red flag. Ordering sushi was a little confusing, as they shorted nigiri' that we ordered.   The rolls are very basic, not much substance to them. If I had to rate the best sushi roll it would be the spicy salmon crunch. The sunshine roll wasn't too shabby either. The nagiri is was loaded with rice.   All in all the sushi is not the best quality, and not a huge variety. If you are looking for good all you can eat sushi head hon machi in Chandler on Alma School and Queen Creek.",

Atmosphere is good too. Great place.",

    "text": "Cold service, bad sushi.  The service was inexplicably cold to us during our visit (our first time to Iron Chef). While the restaurant was decently crowded, there wasn't a line out the door. However, the entire time we felt very rushed to leave: our waitress was cold and silent, barely acknowledging us, giving very curt, one-word answers, never smiling, and seriously doing everything she could to get us the hell out of there by rushing us (giving us the bill before we were halfway done with our meals, snatching the receipt before the pen even left the paper).  To make things worse, the sushi here is MEDIOCRE. I have no idea how this place gets such good reviews unless they were just having an atrocious night. The imitation crab in the deep-fried california roll was very fishy. The baked salmon roll had way too much cream cheese and tasted like deli meat. (???) The shrimp tempura rolls were overcooked by far--tough, chewy, and flavorless. The rolling of the sushi itself was beyond sloppy (they were more like sandwich pinwheels) and just overall not fresh, feeling like they'd been sitting there pre-made. (The food also came out SUSPICIOUSLY fast.)  Overall, there were no redeeming aspects to this place except that the menu said everything was 35% off (but reflected crazy high sushi prices on the surface... 13$ for a shrimp tempura roll?) but kept True to its word: the actual prices were pretty cheap. However, I'd recommend going somewhere else for all-you-can-eat. The atmosphere, service, and food here aren't worth even the cheap price.",

We don't normally eat dessert, but our server suggested we try the green tea ice cream and I will order that again!  We are large group and often times it frustrates the server, but not this one.  He was funny, good, fast and just plain awesome.  Our group was so impressed and said we will be going back there.  Just a word of caution, if you are looking for fancy, this is not it, but if good food and a nice time is what you are after, this is where you should go.",

They pack up everything well, rolls were organized nicely.   Ordered a Philadelphia roll, crunchy shrimp tempura roll, dragon roll, and the Mongolian beef.   The rolls were pretty good. They weren't life changing but definitely better than others I've experienced in Phoenix. However, for the rolls we got, the price seemed a little high. I'm willing to pay a premium for high quality rolls but this may have just been a little much.   The Mongolian beef was just okay. Not bad, just average. We would try it again but probably won't ever be craving it.   Total for food only was $41.40. Again not a bad experience just pricey for what was delivered. I'd recommend it though if you are in the area and searching for some sushi!",

I've been here before when it was crazy busy and had to sit outside in the way too hot summer of Phoenix.  Sushi doesn't sit well in those conditions.  Inside, it was nice and quiet.  Service was great.  AYCE priced a bit high but given that they include Sashimi, I think it's reasonable.  They limit you to 12 pieces of sashimi so if you are a fan and want your money's worth, start with that.  Nigiri was also good.  Quality of the fish and thickness of the sashimi was on point.  Nothing fishy or smelly.    I also got a Dynamite roll as I'm a sucker for the baked scallops in mayo.  The roll underneath was quite heavy and unfortunately took up a lot of stomach space, so I'd go with someone and share it if you can.  Finished with dessert- green tea ice cream.  I'm expecting a tiny scoop of ice cream and they come up with like 3 gigantic scoops.  It was amazing but struggled to fit it all in.  I think I calculated the price of my meal to be over $60, so I think I ate my money's worth.  Would definitely go again.",

    "text": "Highs and Lows. After the great reviews for Iron Chef, my son, a sushi lover and I came to this Chinese run sushi restaurant.   Five stars to the service and hospitality. Our server, Cindy was super kind and attentive even though it was busy, she made sure our food came quickly. She filled up our water glasses and was lovely. When we ordered a second round of miso soup and ginger salad for my son, she even brought me a complimentary salad.   The miso soup was flavorful with konbu seaweed. My son told me he preferred the crunch of nori sprinkled on top, but I thought the deep flavors in the soup was fabulous.  The sashimi and the sushi was fresh and cut well. They were also presented in a lovely way. My son thought that the crab meat in the California roll was a little strong tasting. I just told him that it tasted more authentically like crab unlike most places that served imitation crab meat in their Caifornia rolls.  Their rendition of the volcano roll was fine. We are not really fans of deep fried rolls, but prefer the flame grilled finish ones. However, the flavors were fine.  Why not 4 or 5 stars? The men's bathroom was not clean. My son complained that there was puddle that smelt of urine in the corner. Next, in my complimentary salad, while eating heartily, I bit into something hard. It looked like a piece of raw lobster shell or a spine of a fish fin. But kudos to Cindy, she apologized profusely and took the charge off for the salad and miso soup.",

    "text": "Now, I swear I posted a review MONTHS ago, because we eat here often.   1. Let me start by saying that 99% of the time, I Love this place. Tonight... not so much.   I am not giving this a 3 star rating simply because there was an \"issue\". I'm giving it a 3 star rating because despite my trying to be courteous and discuss the issue with the manager, he interrupted me multiple times, gave me (half a$$) excuses, and didn't do anything to rectify said issues.   Now, 2. I have worked in the restaurant industry for YEARS. I am WELL aware of how it works. Especially when you are new. However, there are ways to avoid mass chaos on a busy night with a new waitress.   All that being said, here is how tonight went.  We arrive, as usual. We are seated per usual. We order per usual. The waitress we have doesn't know the special we use (sometimes) so she brings someone else over. We order... but it takes longer than usual for our drinks to arrive and our appetizer. No worries. It happens. The restaurant is getting busier. Then, we finally order our sushi (it's taken about 15-20 min to get our waitress to come take our sushi order). About 15 min later, after the busser has refilled our drinks 2x, our waitress comes back and says \"which sushi did you order again\". It took another 30 min to get all of our sushi (this is def a rarity as we've never had this occur) however... for another 15 min after we waited for our waitress to come to our table (it's been 45 min since we last saw her mind you). At this point, I ask for the manager. This isn't good service, it's not even OK service... it's down right awful. (All the whole, I watch the table next to us get sat, the same waitress comes to them, takes their initial order and then another waitress who must know them takes over from the original waitress). When I get the manager to our table, he is rude, interrupts everything I say, doesn't want to hear it, and just repeats \"it's her first day and we're busy\" over and over. Neither of which, IMO and experience, is an excuse.   I get first days, I get busy nights, I don't get excuses and being rude.  May or May not go back. I don't know yet. Bad service happens. Bad management isn't excuse-able.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I used to work in the restaurant industry so I know and understand what \"good service\" entails. Needless to say this establishment is an absolute joke. Where should I begin...  The food- The sushi here is beyond disappointing. Not only is the presentation sloppy but I'm totally seriously when I say that it looked as if the chef threw it on the plate and sent it out, without a bat of an eye (rolls falling apart, wasabi and ginger missing, old rice particles stuck to the plate). Okay I can live with a sloppy presentation, but what I cannot deal with is fish that tastes as if its been sitting out all day long, not in a cooler (it was at best room temp, if not warm to some others opinion.) not a good sign. Old hard rice that was for sure a few days old. I'm sorry but this is unacceptable (especially when it comes to raw fish).  The service - The customer service at this establishment is beyond atrocious. A friend and I decided that we wanted sushi late one night. (8pm) We arrived, only to be ignored in an empty restaurant. I walked over to a staff member and asked if we could get some menus and sit outside. The lady nodded at me, said yes, then pointed at the menus. We grabbed the menus and sat ourselves outside. Then we waited... and waited some more... no joke 10-15 minuets had passed and I had to get up and walk inside and ask the same lady for two cups of water. She said  \"ya ya, okay.\" then turned her back and went to grab us two waters (I returned to the table). When she finally brought us our water, she said \"so you ready to order?\". We ordered four rolls, edamame and a bottle of unfiltered sake. 25 min later she brought us our food. One of the rolls was wrong, but at this point we were so hungry we ate it any way (we still haven't received the sake we ordered). While we are about half way into our 2nd roll a man comes out of the restaurant and begins unplugging all the lights (time now is roughly 9pm and they don't \"close\" until 10:30pm). My friend and I just look at each other in darkness as we sit there on their front patio dumbfounded at what is happening. Our server comes out soon after and asks \"well you need anything thing else or what?\", I then told her that we never received our sake, but that we don't need it anymore because we are more than half way done with our meal. She responded with \"okay, well then you pay now.\" (we still have food on our plates and our water glasses are bone dry) I look at my friend and then just handed the waitress cash for our bill + extra for change for the tip. She walks inside and rings us out but then never returns. We both just sat there waiting for her to come back out and bring us our change and water refills.... Nothing. Then the most amazing thing happened... They turned off the lights inside (time now 9:30). So we look at each other once again in amazement. I get up (again) and walk over to the door to find it locked! That's right you are reading this correctly. They left the restaurant and locked the doors with us still sitting on the patio with all our dishes sitting on the table!!! I have never in my life been to an place of business where the employees left customers at the facility and locked the doors behind them. As you can imagine I never revived my change and left feeling like I was just in the twilight zone.  I will NEVER EVER be back and I suggest you stay far far away from this place. There are several other places close by that have way better food and that won't turn the lights out on you and lock the doors an hour before closing time. Note to the owner - you should think twice about you have managing your business, because from what I've experienced on two separate occasions now, is the most horrific customer service I've ever come across.",

    "text": "It's a sad day for this place. 1st and foremost my order was incorrect and ended charging me more for a wrong Oder. I ordered the Dragon Roll $13 and got the golden dragon roll $15 mistake was its right next to each other on there menu(even took a picture) . I hold off with the server about but again it might have been a different style. Then I got the Crunchy shrimp tempura roll $10 Note: to self and to everyone that will be eating here, take this food off you're menu please. It's really not a great food to enjoy.  As the roll and hand roll, it was fresh and yummski but it's not hard to mess up on a salmon roll and hand roll. Over all it's very inexpensive 40% off, disappointed about the hype of this place and how highly you are talked about (1st timer) In short Coming from Los Angeles the food price is ok, quality at 1 to 10 is a 7 (over all)  but how can you miss my order (put more light if you can't see) just saying. Hope that next visit  I hope to change my mind. Would I recommend this place to everyone the answer is yes!!! Would you're experience be the same as mine maybe not. But definitely check this place out and if you don't want anything to go wrong then pick the roll and hand roll side of the menu.",

    "text": "The RUSTY Iron Chef -- a forlorn haiku to poor dining  Maybe they were off the night my brother and I went. They did say they were down someone in the kitchen. But that may only be part of the story. The waiter was great at the start (friendly & helpful), but gradually became the incredible disappearing man. By the mid-meal and up until the end, the pattern turned into hide 'n seek -- this happened three times ... for  (1) a greatly delayed order; (2) more sake and water; (3) the check.   We started with Spring Rolls (good) and Fried Calamari (good 'n plenty chewy -- pencil eraser nubs, anyone?). Then my brother's and pot stickers came. I watched him start and finish ALL of his food while my plate just sat there empty and full of envy. I hunted and chased down our waiter, was told about the missing person behind the counter, and my sushi plate would be ready soon. It ended up taking over 30 minutes. And the quality was sub-standard. The rice under each sushi piece was so dry, it would crumble apart as I would try to lift it off the plate, with chopsticks, then fork and finally spoon. And there was no wasabi smudge under the fish. Although I ordered sushi, what I ended up with was a sampling of sashimi along with a plate of dry, crumbled rice.  So, between the slow service, the vagabond waiter, the chewy calamari and the shoddy sushi ... what else could be said, other than sayonara.  Iron Chef Haiku ...  Waiter can't be found Neither can the sushi plate Then rice dry eyes cry",

As far as all-you can eat sushi goes, I can't think of a better place in Phoenix (and honestly, what all-you-can eat could be healthier than sushi...)  GREAT quality sushi.  A few odd things: 1.  The descriptions of the rolls are on a special menu that you have to request, and even then, there's two rolls that aren't listed and you have to ask what they are. 2.  Ice cream is included in the all-you-can eat price.  However, it is frozen solid into a block of ice frozen into a frozen dish.  It's really inedible.  I bent the spoon trying to hack off a piece.  Disappointing because it's nice to have a bit of soothing dairy after asian cuisine...",

When we found out about the \"all you can eat\" we figured it was probably going to be worthless.  HOWEVER, the price is amazing and the selection is even better.  I've never been to a place that offered up basically their full  Sushi menu on the \"all you can eat\" side.  Sashimi, Speciality rolls. Sushi, a few Salads a few soups, plus dessert.  The portions are just right, great big pieces of fresh fish and not just rice.  Grab a Dragon Roll, they usually are about 13 bucks, order 2 and your meal is covered!  We'll be back soon to this new neighborhood spot.",

I think it is trying too hard to be a fusion/sushi/sport bar to cater everyone which just doesn't really work ... having buffalo chicken wing and a big screen playing hockey can't qualify you to be a sport bar   Had some sushi roll and nigiri  ... the texture of the rice just not right ... you can't use chinese/thai rice to make sushi, it just simply not is... and had the cucumber wrap with tuna inside ... good try but the cucumber are sliced too thick (this is where you can see the skill of the chef) that the dish is losing its essence.  Though I would give them credit for the pricing ... it's good price given its location. Also, even if you are not at Happy hour, you can get 1/2 off sushi for yelp check in.",

The first visit, we sat outside and were blown away by the quality and scrumptiousness of the rolls we ordered.    Since then, we have been ordering take-out almost every Friday for the last... 6 months or more.   We have tried most of their rolls and everything, and I mean everything has been delicious!!  The downsides are the parking lot... a total S%&* Show to get in and out of and the dining room is a bit 'meh', but the quality of the food and the AMAZING customer service FAR outweigh the negatives, so it still gets a 5 star rating from me.  And this Friday,  you can bet that I will be battling for the Take Out parking space out front to get my order!!!",

It was a like an instant trip to the islands and complimented the other rolls with it's \"not too sweet\" sweetness. Service was excellent and considering the place was pretty full, I felt like our sushi arrived quickly. They have 5 or 6 outside tables for when the weather is nice, so take advantage of that. Also, if you check in on Yelp*, you get an instant coupon worth 50% (yes 50%!) off almost every roll on the menu. Now that's a great deal!",

Yes, I'm aware the food is very cheap and affordable, but the past times I have been here the food has been excellent and delicious for the price. Like a little above average tasting sushi.  Today me and a friend ordered the Spicy tuna, Spicy scallop, spicy salmon and shrimp tempura rolls, and the edamame and gyoza appetizers.   The only thing that was good was the gyoza, hot and fresh, but the edamame was cold and undercooked.  The spicy salmon roll was below average but ok. And the shrimp tempura rolls was ok, but it was cold, like it has been left out for awhile. Definitely didn't taste fresh at all. We ended up not finishing this roll.  The worst was the spicy scallop and spicy tuna. Both rolls were watery and had a nasty bad fishy taste to them. I can't believe that Iron Chef served us such nasty sushi since they have been nothing but great in the past, but these rolls were unacceptable. Both my friend and I only ate one piece each and refused to eat the rest of those rolls. We both ended up getting food sickness once we got home.  I might've give this restaurant one more chance since they've been great up until now, but it wasn't just one sushi roll that was bad, and raw fish should never have that taste or texture in sushi. Only one appetizer was good, and one sushi roll was average at best.",

However, when I go to sushi restaurants, I always pay attention to the rice sushi ratio and Iron chef uses way too much rice and not enough other ingredients. I recommend sashimi style. Overall, it's a good quick easy and cheap sushi place.",

Most impressive thing... no such thing as Krab on their menu, it's real crab, like it should be.  Try the Phoenix roll.  Lobster, crab, shrimp all in one delicious roll.  Staff is super friendly, the chefs got their \"A\" game on all the time and the prices are unbeatable!!!  I really want to keep this place all for myself!",

Eating sushi for me is usually a choice of either good quality or reasonable prices. That is not the case at iron chef, if you know what to order the quality is excellent and the prices are unbelievably cheap if you are dining in. This is my go-to sushi restaurant and will always be, highly recommend I would give it 6 stars if it was an option.",

Unfortunately, I did not catch my server's name.    Iron Chef has the best happy hour ever!  All rolls are 50% off and many other items are 40% off, and they have great drink specials.  There is also a reverse happy hour from 8-10.  I honestly need to come back because I wanted to try 20 things on the menu...they have quite an extensive menu.    I ended up ordering the squid salad, the ahi tuna martini and spring rolls and a mai tai.  I know I am a piglet, but I did indeed eat it all!  The squid salad was good, not the best I have ever had, but still very delicious.  I cleaned the dish!  The ahi tuna martini was fabulous!  There was tons of fresh, cold tuna and it tasted spectacular with the seaweed, cucumber and the sauce brought it all together.  As you can tell from the picture, it had quite the presentation as well.  Everything at Iron Chef seems to have a lovely presentation in general, I was enjoying watching all the dishes come from the kitchen/sushi bar.  You can tell the spring rolls are made in house; nothing too excting to say about spring rolls but they are $2!    Again my server was a doll, I will be sure to catch her name next time!  Everything is very reasonably priced and I hope my fortune cookie is right!",

They said when they print \"gravy\" it means \"brown sauce.\" It was as dry as hell, no moisture. They said it was \"baked in sauce.\" Nonsense. It was inedible. They just lied about forgetting gravy. Egg foo young wo/gravy is like shrimp alfredo wo/cheese.  This is my 2nd review. My 1st was a 5 star review of another restaurant.

We had the schezuan shrimp, medium spicy, was perfect.  I asked for no bell peppers and they didn't disappoint. I'm just not a big fan of cooked celery either but it's a common vegetable in Chinese food. Plenty of broccoli. Yummy..   Also had the Mongolian beef. Tender slices of beef, not chewy, cooked well, good sauce. Lots of flavor. No extra charge for brown rice.   In looking at the sushi rolls sitting on the sushi bar, nice size rolls. Not those little skimpy ones that you find. Menu is very varied, we will return.  Prices are good and appropriate.  2 entrees that come with brown rice, one side of roast pork fried rice, and we have leftovers, $31.00  Enjoy!",

When we walked in I was looking for a hostess but to my surprise nothing. Someone just told us to take a seat. So we find our own table. Waitress is very good and tells us all the Chef's Special rolls are 50% off all the time. Very cool.   We ordered the Dragon roll, Caterpillar roll, and Crunchy Shrimp roll. The rolls were really good. Very fresh. We really enjoyed them. Not bad for a Chinese/Japanese place.   I also ordered the House Special Chow Mein which had a nice mix of veggies, BBQ portk, and shrimp. Noodles cooked very good. Overall, it tasted okay. Not great and also not the worst I had before so it was good.   My wife ordered the Chicken Yaki Udon noodles. So I guess when you order one of their Japanese  dishes they give you a bowl of miso soup. Soup was really good. Have to say it was outstanding. My daughter and wife shared the udon noodles. They both loved it. The chicken was very moist and tender. My wife enjoyed he noodles said it was cooked right and wasn't overpowering. They gobbled it up. So I would have to say they enjoyed it.   Service we really good. They had three waitresses running around helping out their tables. All were Asian women and were very helpful. Cup were filled in a timely manner and they were really kind and smiling. That's they type of service I'm looking for. Also, the food came out really quickly. They also have a nice little area outside that looked nice to sit at especially with this great weather right now.   So we had a great time, good food, good sushi and good service. If you can handle a little self service to find your own table then this is the place for you. Choice of Japanese or Chinese food. Really. Iron Chef somehow makes this works. I'm not complaining and I'll be back. Enjoy.",

Order was taken quickly . I ordered the Arizona roll with a 40% discount it came to 9.75. The sushi was ok but nothing special. There was very little filling with a deep fried shrimp.  I haven't eaten out much in Phoenix yet I was definitely not impressed enough to want to come back. Meal was presented nicely though",

Then I get a call back from her after 10 mins where she corrected my bill, and politely offered me a complimentary bowl of miso soup for the inconvenience.

I tried an assortment of sushi and sashimi including the surf clam (which is always a great way to measure freshness), the shrimp tempura sashimi, eel , shrimp and salmon.    The fish is fresh and prepared with a modern twist.  The entire lunch was provided to me on one large plate which made it easier to eat, as well as simpler to sample each variety of sushi without having to move plates around the table.   The interior was carried over from Pick Up Stix, the previous tenant - it a small dining area without too much room to dine.  I was able to eat outside which I prefer until the heat comes scorching in.  The service is good, not great.  Expect to wait for at least 15 minutes for your food.  However, it is worth the wait.   Iron Chef also offers an all you can eat sushi buffet, half off happy hour and a Chinese menu.  A great option for most any time.",

The waiter left something off of our order and wasn't at all apologetic when we asked about it.  If you're looking for a decent sushi happy hour, Iron Chef will suffice but it probably won't be your new favorite.",

The sushi rolls were way over packed with rice-little fish and not 1 of the rolls stayed together(had to fork it). They also forgot 2 different toppings on 2 separate rolls. It seems as the restaurant has gotten more popular, they have put less effort into pushing out quality product. I can understand if they were busy- but there were 2 people in the restaurant and 5 sushi chefs behind the bar. Great deals, but at what cost?",

Not much in the way of ambiance, but not at all shabby. And you really can't complain considering how inexpensive it is. My boyfriend and I stuffed our faces and had 4 rolls, two appetizers, two large beers, and a large sake for about $40.",

    "text": "This is a Chinese owned Sushi restaurant and they were careful with me since I've order Uni and ask them if it is fresh or not and I asked them in Chinese so they know that they are dealing with a customer who probably have knowledge on the food so they carefully looked at it and told me it is the last order so I ask them if they will eat it themselves and they were willing to give me a discount so I took it.  I came in with Livingsocial offer of prix-fixed deal with one regular and one specialty roll plus appetizer. They said the additional items were half price for me since we were there in happy hours.  The service was delightful and friendly and the food was decent but NOT the freshest sushi in the world but good enough as compared to other restaurants here in the Valley since they are on the mercy of their supplier as far as the quality of the fish goes.  Like a typical Chinese/Korean owned sushi, it tends to be slightly over seasoned but not too intrusive in my eyes.  If you are the REAL sushi master, this place may not cut it for you but it is good enough for me and my friend.",
