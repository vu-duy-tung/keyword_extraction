    "text": "I usually love Cafe Zupa's but this location is very disappointing:( I ordered a Strawberry Salad and asked the server how much would it be to add blackberries to my salad and she said any additions are  69 cents. So I had her add them. After I had paid I noticed my receipt had a charge for a fruit cup for $2.49. I knew I hadn't ordered a fruit cup so I went to the cashier to let them know my receipt was wrong. The manager stated that since berries are so expensive - that is why he charged me so much! I told him what the server had told me about it being only 69 cents extra and he just shrugged his shoulders and said-\"Sorry - I will have to tell her she was wrong!.\" Most managers would have at least offered to give me a refund or something but he acted like he could care less - this is not good customer service and I will not be back to this location as long as this manager is working.",

When I asked for more the employee looked to his manager to see if that was ok. The salad was almost $9 and was 99% spinach. When I told the cashier that I barely received toppings she said I could get more if I paid more. Smh. I will never return",

I've been to this one about 5 times, and each time I get an awkward experience from the staff, making me less likely to come back.   The soups and salads are always good, but interacting with the staff (during dinner time) makes me not want to go here. Sometimes I get silent blank stares instead of, \"What would you like?\" Or \"can I help you decide on something?\"   At the Mesa location, I never had to recite my whole order to the cashier after ordering it up front. Can't the Chandler staff just communicate with each other to make sure that the order stays together?   Location wise, it's on a corner across from the mall where there is always a lot of traffic, and trying to find a parking spot and then not getting run into when leaving that parking spot sometimes feels like too much effort to get a salad.   But maybe I'll forget about the staff (hopefully they get better with customer service) and location after awhile and crave a salad/soup/bread/strawberry dinner. Will I return? Possibly.",

Their food is fresh and amazing, and they always have great new seasonal soups along with the staples which are equally as good.  The only bummer is that I so often crave a good soup and sandwich on a Sunday afternoon, and they are not open on Sundays.  I get it, but still miss the opportunity to fulfill this craving.",

    "text": "I visited the establishment this evening with my family and friends. I have always had a decent experience here until tonight. After today I will not be going to this restaurant anymore neither will any of my family and friends. I will encourage them to seek food else where. To start I ordered the half  protein salad and half avocado bacon turkey sandwhich. I politely asked to have yellow peppers added to my sandwich. I was immediately shot down and was  told no they can't do that. When I asked why they offered no decent explanation even though I offered to pay the extra difference it usually costs. So I said fine you can't add them to my sandwich, can you add them to my salad that's already open and can simply just put them in there like all the other veggies. The girl told me no again with her coworker rudely shaking her head in the background. From then on I proceeded to get attitude as I checked out. To me this was absolutely ridiculous, if someone has an allergy you are tell me they can't take off what's on their sandwich? When going to a place like this you should always be able to add or subtract ingredients that they offer. I have visited the Desert Ridge location and have never had a problem. This has been the worse experience followed up by terrible customer service. I encourage the owner to really look over his staff, so he doesn't loose anymore business due to his poorly trained and impolite team members.",

My Kale and Quinoa salad which was made with blueberries, grapes, parmesan cheese, cherries and nuts was tossed nicely but with a tasteless dressing.  The Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup had a tasty broth but was a tad salty.  One of my diing partners ordered the Lobster Bisque and was turned off by the saltiness of the soup.  She paid for croutons as an extra, tried adding extra crackers to balance the soup but she still could not enjoy it.  The kitchen staff kindly gave sour cream to blend in but that didn't work.  She sampled the New England Clam Chowder but that too had an off the chart salt reading.  She ended up ordering the Crab Avocado Melt instead and the kind staff brought it to our table no charge.  That's great service!  I have dined at the Camelback location and had wonderful experiences.  Perhaps it could be that this location just opened up earlier this month and needs time to get things down pat.   I will return to Cafe Zupas for they usually serve up wonderful meals.  I'll give it a few months.  :)",

First the restaurant is clean, the staff is very professional and friendly, then the great food. The price is VERY REASONABLE and you get fresh, quality food. On all my visits I have tried a new salad and sandwich but always get the Wisconsin Cauliflower Cheese soup. So far my favorite sandwich is the BBQ pulled pork, the bread was fresh and soft, pork juicy and tender, sauce tangy and sweet, vegetables fresh. My favorite salad has been the Chicken Maui, the pineapple vinaigrette is the best dressing I have ever had, also comes with chunks of pineapple, mango, coconut, and macadamia nuts.  I recommend this place if you are looking for a fresh healthy salad, sandwich, and soup. I also recommend the cheesecake, it was in my top five cheesecakes of all time.",

Free chocolate covered strawberry added to the plate nice touch. Didn't have other dessert which are apparently made on premises but they sure looked good.  This place is nothing fancy at all, but a five star location.  Pretty sure I'll walk across the street and eat there for dinner.",

    "text": "So ok. This place definitely has 5 star potential. But there is one MAJOR concern here...PRICE.  Im sorry, but salad is not GOURMET.  Its salad. Sure, you can dress it up with roasted corn and herb dressing....its still salad. Same can be said about soup. Even a soup with incredible flavors happening, doesnt really cost that much to produce, especially in large quantities. A half serving of soup here is just under 5.00.  WAY too high.  Enough complaining. I ordered the Try 2 Combo.. -Cuban sandwich and a half Chicken Chop Salad -I also got a half soup. I ordered the Chicken Tortilla   ( Total for order..a little over 16.00)  The Cuban was very tasty. The pork was layered thick, and was very tender.  The salad was very good as well. I like green leaf lettuce as a salad base, not iceburg, which is primarily water. I enjoyed the herb dressing, and i like how they tossed all the lettuce in the dressing, before adding the rest of the ingredients. the chicken topping tasted like fresh chicken. The tortilla soup was good, as well. I like creamier tortilla soups, as this one was broth based, but it was still really good. If you like a more creamier type tortilla soup, try their Chicken enchilada soup. I got a small sample, and it was very good. The wedge of bread that came with dinner helped with the removal of broth from my bowl. :)  And of course, the complimentary chocolate dipped strawberry was juicy, and not over ripe.  Overall, not bad.  I will most likely come back...but not as often as im sure id like to...but maybe thats not so bad. :)  My waistline will thank me.",

Now I get the vegetarian sandwich and the same salad but with no chicken since I'm a vegetarian now . Only thing is is wish they had different protein options if we don't eat meat since everything has chicken",

This is odd to me because the other locations I've frequented actually suggested which soups taste best together and encouraged me to mix- at which point I can as hooked. I drove almost 30 minutes because I was hungry for the soup combination I'd had at other Zupas locations. I expressed that I came specifically for this reason and they weren't budging. Not apologetic. Not willing to make an exception. After paying, I asked for the supervisor. She proceeds to tell me the same thing. I asked if the locations are individually owned or why rules would vary so much from one place to another, to which she said the other locations obviously are \"not following the rules\". Well... at least they're friendly and providing service that pleases their guests. Shouldn't that be the goal? She could obviously care less about my disappointment and when I walked away, another employee approached her laughing and giving me dirty looks, shaking her head, etc. The \"supervisor\" I just spoke with began whispering and laughing and also joined in with the crazy looks. I am appalled by this type of treatment towards a customer. I have a family size of eight. I will make sure we never visit Zupas for lunch or dinner. We can take our business to plenty of restaurants that will appreciate such a large family spending money with them, a place where they value their customers and treat them with courtesy and express themselves with professionalism. This was ridiculous!!!!",

I put in the same order every time. There is going to be a very big change in the frequency of my visits. The main reason is the what they've done to the Lobster Bisque soup. The bisque is now watered down, and they replaced the chunks of lobster with bits of tomato. The soup has been a complete disappointment on the last four visits, so we're not going to try it ever again. Also, make sure to watch your salad prep. They accidentally put the wrong ingredient in my salad, so they thought the way to fix it was to dig it out with their finger. That was gross to watch.",

They offer a variety of salads, sandwiches and soups and they let you sample the soups if you're not sure what tastes good. This place runs like an assembly line where one person takes your order, the next person makes the salad while another person works on the sandwich order, the next person gets your soup and then the last two people plate your orders on the tray and rings you up. One of my favorite things to order here is the strawberry salad and I always get the lobster bisque. They put the right amount of dressing in your salad so your salad using drenched with dressing. You can get a combo which are two small half orders of either a sandwich, soup or salad. Also each order comes with a chocolate covered strawberry !  It can get pretty busy during lunch and dinner but the lines move fast .",

I received everything I didn't order. To top that off the girl gave me an attitude, telling me that's not what I told her...like it was my fault. I order the same exact thing every time I go..so I know that's not on me.  Also... who actually tells the customer they are wrong and didn't say that?!?  Then they completely forgot to give my boyfriend his salad. I decided to try it again tonight, thinking it had been an off day. Everyone there was nice tonight... but they ran out of rolls and didn't tell me until I paid. One of the main reasons I go is because of the bread and soup. I was really upset to find that out. It should be told before you order your food, otherwise I never would have ordered soup. The girl behind me was just as upset about it. One of the girls behind the register was sweet and offered us ciabatta. Then someone, I don't know if it was a shift manager, or what... but she started saying that it wasn't ok to do that and \"blaaahh blah blaahh\". I was annoyed. You ran out of rolls and this employee was trying to make everyone happy... while the person in charge was saying \"no you can't do that\". I just spent $30 something on food... you can give me a piece of frickin bread without complaining!  When I got home I was realllllyyyy disappointed. I open my salad and it smelled fermented. It literally smells like wine was being made in there. Everything about this salad just looked and tasted bad. I ended up throwing the entire thing away. The only thing that I enjoyed was my soup. This location needs a lot of help.",

    "text": "I went after the lunch rush around 3 pm and had absolutely terrible service. There seemed to be no managers on the line, only the servers and two other girls who seemed to be in charge of the others (they color code shirts for ranks). I had to repeatedly state my order and a girl named Riley took it in the beginning of the line. She wasn't very friendly and I wanted to change something in my sandwich but she moved on to the next customer without even a thank you, just a hurried, monotone \"and what can I get started for you today?\" To the girl behind me, the only other customer in line.  I got the lobster bisque soup which tasted absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it. Most places don't make their soups by scratch but you can tell from cafe zupas they put a lot of care into getting their recipes just right. the person at soups was a lot friendlier than Riley or the other \"manager\" on the line who asked what I ordered. She was somewhat aggressive and asked me what I got. You'd think they would have a ticket system like most restaurants so you don't have to repeat your order all the time.   Service in general isn't that great here. There seems to be no manager when I'm there, and when I came during the lunch rush i only saw one once and he was very friendly and attentive to my order. Food is good but I wish the servers would treat customers better instead of as an annoyance to their routine. However I'm highly disappointed in the lack of respect I received during my visits, especially from so called \"managers\".",

    "text": "Similar to Paradise Bakery. I like being able to create my own salad. I am a big salad eater, and it always seems like people think I am being high maintenance by either omitting or requesting to add ingredients to my salads. You basically get to pick 5 ingredients, your salad mix, and then a protein. In my opinion it's the perfect portion.  The thing I don't like about the sandwiches is that they only offer ciabatta bread. They should create some sort of whole grain healthy alternative.  They also offer a \"recharge bar\" where you can plug in your phone/iPad. The only downside is you have to have your own Power cord. Who walks around with one of those? Cool concept though.  The gross part: the moldy rotten chocolate dipped strawberry I received for free. Lol. Gross!",

I saw people clearing the table so they could sit... Napkin dispenser was nearly empty, too.  Today I ordered the large Glazed Chicken Chipotle Salad, which was very good! But here's the thing. The large is $2 more than the half. For the most part, the only difference is more greens. With few exceptions, the toppings are the same amount for half or large. The half seems to be the better value!",

So when my wife and I went today, I thought I would try a salad.  My wife got the Combo of a full sandwich and a half salad.  But I got the Full Salad, which costs more and is labeled \"Full\" which I interpreted as  double what the half salad is.  We ordered the same exact salad and they were side-by-side on the tray.  I was very disappointed to see that my Full Salad was nowhere near double my wife's Half Salad...in fact it wasn't much bigger at all.  From what I could tell, all they really did is make a slightly bigger salad and put it in a bigger bowl.  I wish I had taken a picture.  I looked at the cashier and asked \"THAT'S a full salad?\" pointing to mine, and she said \"Yep!\" and that was it.  Although I loved the taste of the salad, it did not fill me up...probably because it was not a Full Salad.  Disappointed but the next time we go I'll have to stick with the soup.",

Fortunately , we were the only ones in line ordering .The kale quinoa salad  was delicious . More restaurants should embrace kale . The pesto chicken sandwich was really tasty . My husband had the mushroom soup and California avocado sandwich and really enjoyed it . A nice touch is the little chocolate covered strawberry . The $23 tab was very reasonable . The atmosphere is busy and chaotic so it's not the place to go for a leisurely , mellow dining experience. But for a good lunch made with high quality fresh sourced ingredients , it fits the bill .",

If you don't want a salad then why do I have to wait behind the four people that have no idea what they want on theirs?  If I want soup can I just skip them? It seems rude so I never do I just wait.  The veggie quinoa soup I ordered was 25% quinoa and 50% salt.  I was glad I got a sandwich or I wouldn't have had anything to eat.  My California Turkey sandwich was pretty good.

You have to tell at least 3 different people what you want to order (the person who takes your order, the person who puts your food on the tray, and finally the person at the cashier). There's also a game of telephone that goes on from person to person with the order. This caused my husband's sandwich order to get messed up several times. It took them 3 sandwiches to get it right. Totally unacceptable. You guys should start writing down orders on a paper like other places do that way we don't have to repeat ourselves so many times... it'll also prevent mistakes from happening.",

That surprised me since they have so many choices. As for dessert, no dairy free choices. I'll be back for salad and soup when in the area.  Would have been 5 Stars but no wheat, cold soup and no non-dairy desserts.   Stop in and give them a try if you haven't already done so.   Peace",

This one is different and also very confusing when you first go in.  As you move along the line the salad selections are first.  That's also where you order the sandwiches.  I discovered that way down the line.  There salads looked amazing.  However, I really like romaine lettuce or at least lettuce that's a little crunchy.  Their website indicates they offer a chopped lettuce crunchy like romaine but all they really offered were two types of leafy, limp lettuce.  I'm definitely not a fan.   I ordered the crab/avocado sandwich and it was very good.  The soups looked good as did the desserts.  Maybe another time I'll try something else.  I doubt it'll be one of their salads unless they bring in a crunchy lettuce.",

    "text": "First off I received a postcard mail for this new place. 50% off your entire dine-in meal. What a great deal! And if you make it to the first 50 customers for certain days then you get a $10 gift card. Too bad I wasn't one of those first 50.   When you walk through the doors a worker greeted each person and provided a menu. The menu is nicely done with pictures of each item, with descriptions and prices. It also shows available house-made sauces, house-made dressings and spice blends. Everything looked so appetizing! The decor was a fresh look of lime green and deep red. Tables and booths are plentiful.   Since I love variety I went for the 2 combo which is regularly $8.79 for a choice of 2 items: whole sandwich, half soup, or half salad. It comes with bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry!!! Wow! That is a very nice complement to a meal and a rare complement for any meal that I've seen! This deserves a major star!! For the kiddos (10 years and younger) they also get a combo deal for a 2-choice of baked chicken strips, fruit cup, grilled cheese or small soup for $3.99. They even get a choice of bread or a chocolate dipped strawberry and small drink!! You lucky kids!!   If you're not into the combo deals you can always get whole sandwich, salad or soup for $5.49, $7.59 and $6.39 respectively. And halves of salad and soup for $5.59 and $4.39 respectively. And the great part is that you'll receive the fresh french baguette and the chocolate dipped strawberry!   There were at least 15 people ahead of us but Cafe Zupas did a phenomenal job in efficiently handling the line quickly! Probably took 7 minutes-ish. At the end of the line before you get to the register to pay they have a nice display of some desserts!! More deliciousness to add to the meal. This time around I passed on it but I foresee me getting one next time.   I ordered the combo of pesto chicken sandwich and the roasted red pepper and lobster soup.   Pesto chicken: had sliced almonds, roasted red peppers, muenster cheese, tomato and sprouts. This was a new kind of pesto sandwich for me because of the almonds. For me it was a bit too much almonds. Maybe it wasn't spread out evenly. The size of the sandwich was a bit smaller than most places hence the whole sandwich.   Roasted red pepper soup: \"Rich and savory\" it actually had real lobster meat! Yum! This had a little bit too much saltiness for my taste buds. If you're the type that seasons your dish with loads of salt or soy sauce then you might be okay with it. I dipped the bread to tone down the saltiness.   The chocolate dipped strawberry ended my meal with a sweet note.   The variety of the foods and the price points were pretty decent. I really enjoyed the complementary choc dipped strawberry. And the service for the grand opening days were pleasant.",

Is it healthy? Well, I suppose it's healthier than eating a burger, but do you notice that every salad has some sort of sugary dressing on it? Also, while the soups are tasty, most of them taste like they have a fair amount of cream in them.   You can easily get full here from anything you order, whether it is a soup, salad, sandwich, or combination of the two. The added chocolate dipped strawberry is a nice touch, and although the dining area was busy, there wasn't an issue finding anywhere to sit.  Service was great, and everyone here greeted me with a friendly smile.",

The experience was delightful, it was packed and we had some time to really look at the menu. When we got to the front we were greeted genuinely and warmly, and were treated that way to the very end. The soup guy offered each of us multiple samples and though it was incredibly difficult, I chose the mushroom soup (can't remember the name) with my chicken pesto sandwich. I'm definitely getting the Wisconsin cauliflower next. I'd probably give about -.2 stars for the fact that a French bread was advertised but we got a dinner roll. And the soup was delicious and I do love mushrooms but it was a bit mushroom overload by the end of the bowl. Overall I am very excited to make my way through the entire menu and we will all be back very soon.",

    "text": "I received a gift card to Cafe Zupas recently and my husband and I decided to check it out tonight.  My first impression of Cafe Zupas was based on their website, which is very clean and easy to use.    Once we arrived, I noticed that they have their menu posted on a well lit pillar just outside the door.  From there my husband and I were able to figure out exactly what we wanted before we stood in line.  The set up to order is pretty much like you would see at a Chipotle, where they ask you what you'd like if you're ordering a salad or a sandwich.  The soups are toward the end of the line.    One thing I noticed right away was that the restaurant is very clean and tidy.  Many of the ingredients up front as well as in the back room were all labeled.  I really enjoyed that you could see through to the back room.  While we were waiting to pay, I noticed a worker dipping the strawberries which comes with each meal.   My husband and I both had the whole sandwich half soup or salad deal and the salted caramel creme brulee.   I also noticed that they have a drink station with house made lemonade and green teas.  I thought that was pretty cool since the ingredients of each drink was listed.  (There were 5 or less for each drink)  Our meals were amazing!  I wasn't able to nibble on my husbands because he must have been really hungry and he really enjoyed his sandwich and salad!  I had the Grilled Cheese and the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup.  It was all amazing!  I thought the creme brulee was really good. I even mentioned to my husband that you know it's good when you can see the specks of vanilla! Yummy!  I was very satisfied with Cafe Zupas and I can't wait to return!",

Did they loose their knives? The soup was good (potato & green chili) but, like all their soups, way too salty.  The gal that was running the register was obviously having a bad day. Or had zero personality.  Most of the chairs the paint is peeling off.  Time to find another place for soups and salads...",

My California Protein Cobb was presented beautifully and the fresh herb vinegette dressing was heaven. They offer me a dinner roll instead of the French bread. Thats okay. BUT their dining room needs some serious work. I sat in a booth by the fountain drinks toward the back. There was a bug flying around me and my salad. Ugh  so while I was enjoying the beautiful salad, I had to guard it too. So I didn't enjoy my dining experience. After I finished my food, I turned to the Wall and I spotted about 6 more bugs fruit flies near the bottom of the paintings. Ugh call the bug company please fix this problem!",

The sign on the way out says 'we don't take tips but nice words are appreciated'.... maybe that's the problem? No tips? No nice treatment? It's a shame that we live in this world but we do....

When I walked in there was a long line, I asked the girl handing out menus at the door how long the wait was, she said \"I just clocked it and it is 4 minutes\" well she needed to add 20 minutes on to that time.   The veggies, meats, soups etc are prepped.  Just place some greens in a bowl, add toppings and BAM you have a salad.  A few people in front of me had to send back their orders becuase they were constantly wrong. When I finally got to the check out I asked if I could phone my order in and I was informed hopefully in August that will be up and running for phone/on line orders.  I have eaten at the Mesa and Scottsdale as well and the service was not this slow.   I will be back........ in a few months.  Hopefully they will have worked out all their 'issues' in the meantime Jimmy Johns is right across the way and they are 'Freakishly Fast'",

The ordering process is pretty ridiculous and you can tell the employees have a hard time figuring out which dish belong to who once you move down the line. You can definitely tell that this is a very new place because of the chaos and mixed up orders. Because the food is so good, and they've only been open a short time, I'm inclined to come back in a few months when things hopefully run more smoothly. I also hate the containers that they put to-go salads in, the compartments mean a large salad get squished to one side and then it's hard to mix.

The last two times, it was outrageously salty.  I've been getting this soup for over a year.  Suddenly, it has a handful of chopped tomatoes, maybe 3-4 kernels of corn, literally one slice of chicken and nearly all liquid.   It's like the guy skimmed it from the top of the pot.  Extremely disappointing.  And I have to tell them every time that when they  pack the bag, you can't put two soups and the plastic disposable containing the strawberry and bread in one bag.  It all tips over and spills out.  Grocery bags are simply not appropriate to carry soup. Zupas needs flat bottom bags.",

    "text": "House put together, not House made... I was looking for something quick and healthier as we were hitting the road. The website made this appear to be perfect place! Very disappointed. They don't \"prepare\" everything in the kitchen. If they did, they would have a piece of lettuce available for a lettuce wrap. I have an allergy to yeast. So I asked for a tortilla, I was told they don't have those either. They said they only have one kind of bread for my moms sandwich, ciabatta. Frustrated, I moved along. Their salads looked great but eating on the road makes soup and salad a difficult choice. I then decided to at least get a water. Their ice bucket with an inch of melted ice wasn't keeping anything cold. So I asked for a cold water from the fridge behind the check out. The cashier rolled her eyes at me. I paid for the water and had to reach to the back of the counter to get it, it was not even slid to the middle of the counter before the cashier walked away. It was room temperature. That would've been nice to tell me that your \"fridge \" was simply storage. My moms sandwich? Sad. Tons of dressing, thinly sliced meat-2 microscopic slices, and a thin piece of cheese. That was all ciabatta!The only thing I can say positive, my moms sandwich came with a chocolate covered strawberry. That gets them 1 star.",

    "text": "I will not return, and here's why:  I was becoming a regular customer as they seemed fresher/healthier than the average fast-food restaurant.  They had a couple slip-ups prior to my last evening, very dry chicken on salads (complaint by me and my mom's meal), a bacon issue, and then another day I ordered soup/salad combo and they forgot to put the chicken on my salad. When I went up to show them, they took their time, while my other food was sitting on the table with no-one to watch it.  I was also charged one day incorrectly at the register, and luckily caught it, in which he refunded the amount.  Here's the clincher:  One evening I went in approx. 7:40pm, as I work later, and the manager who was first on line behind the food counter asked if I would be eating in or taking out.  I said that I would like to eat in, (it's 110 degrees out and I still had errands).  He said that I couldn't eat in as they were having an employee meeting at 8pm and I wouldn't be able to.  I said, don't you close at 9pm?  He said there was a sign on the door.  I went to look at it, and it was a white piece of paper with wrinkled corners taped to side and not something I would have really noticed.  Most professional businesses will always have their meetings prior or after hours, never affecting their main customer hours.  The worst part of it was the way I was talked to, and then I got angry and came back and asked for the corporate number.  He stated, there wasn't one and I could find the email online.  As I left, he and another co-worker laughed and talked about it. I felt like I was back in middle school.  I  can put up with an occasional dry chicken, etc., but not being laughed at or treated poorly.  I would have probably only taken 15 minutes to eat.  Needless to say, I wrote a very civil letter to their corporate customer service email, especially having restaurant experience in my past (my mom owned an excellent restaurant), telling them in detail what happened.  Wouldn't you know, I received \"no\" response.  Considering the restaurant success rate, I would think they would have cared a little more.  Well, there's lot's more to choose from!",

It's a cafeteria-style order/serving so just let them know what you want and they'll prepare for you and when done, grab your cups, dessert treat (maybe you got a chocolate-covered strawberry as I did and I added four more). The line moves pretty quick so don't the one holding it up for everyone!  Lunchtime is always pretty busy so make sure you arrive early to secure a table. On this visit, I went with the Cobb salad and lobster bisque soup which was pretty good. If you have a small group or you're looking to have a sync meeting with coworkers or friends and you're looking for a healthy offering or an alternative to some of the other places like Panera, this is a good place to try near the Chandler Mall.",

    "text": "Although this location deserves one star solely for how stingy they are with salad toppings, unfortunately, this one star is due to something else entirely. I literally eat at this restaurant every single day and order the exact same thing. With that being said, you'd think it would be safe to assume that my order is as smooth as butter each time right? WRONG!  It's actually the opposite, it seems as if every time I come in there's a problem ranging from being charged for toppings I didn't receive, being told I'm lying about said charge, and now being blatantly overcharged.  The most upsetting part about the entire situation is the incompetent shift leader whom I allowed to see my bank app which clearly showed the last transaction was deducted looked at me and said \"well I don't know what is going on with your bank-- I know my system, Ive been here 5yrs.. we didn't charge you\" I then asked her if my total was over $9 due to purchasing a drink that is not in stock why wouldn't the process be to just refund me $2-- the shift leader, the individual that should be smart enough to handle customer dissatisfaction then looked at me and said \"well, she (referring to the cashier) should have-but thats not how the transaction was processed and we cant go back\" she went on to explain that I now would have to swipe my card again to repurchase a salad I already paid for. After my many failed attempts to explain to her that she's asking me to pay $16 for 1/2 create your own salad I asked for an actual manager. At this time I was advised that Cafe Zapa doesn't actually have a manager-- just a shift leader  THE LIES!  I ended up leaving hungry, and without a salad although I was very clearly charged for both a salad and a drink.  Long story short, avoid the frustration and scarce rations! Eat somewhere else... ANYWHERE ELSE. The level of customer service or lack thereof at this location is ridiculous.",

    "text": "I am really surprised that I haven't reviewed Cafe Zupas for any of the locations that I have now visited. We've been all the way from their west side location, to central phoenix, and to the eastern part of the city.  This is a great alternative for the Panera bread / Wildflower crowd. They sell paninis, salads and soups. They also have some pretty good desserts, such as the chocolate mousse cake and the salted carmel creme brulee.   Do not read the menu posted outside of the place. The food offerings there are not the same as the menu posted inside the restaurant. My wife was disappointed to see that they didn't have the sandwich she'd wanted on the outside menu. I liked my salad and soup, and my wife liked her sandwich, but didn't care for the clam chowder. It was too salty and watered down. The desserts were quite good.  We always like that they add the free chocolate covered cherry with your dish and the bread roll. Their bread rolls are great.   We didn't notice bad customer service. Our food came out quickly even with the change my wife made on the sandwich. They weren't particularly cheerful, but perhaps it was a bad day. We normally visit a different Cafe Zupas.  A big plus was the freshness of their enfused water drinks. We loved the raspberry basil drink and the strawberry orange drink.  All in all it was a decent visit. Hopefully the clam chowder will be better next time, and they'll fix that menu confusion soon.",

I'm not giving 5 stars only because it is a bit pricey and there's no customer type of incentive like punch card for future discount or coupons-- would be nice to get something for my repeat business. Also when I order all keto friendly food I'm still offered free chocolate strawberry and bread! Maybe offer regular strawberry or some SF desserts?  Overall great place and I highly recommend especially if your on low carb or keto diet!!",

I ordered the soup & sandwich combo & opted for a \"million dollar\" dessert bar to split amongst us. However... my food never came.   I first asked after my coworkers (who ordered AFTER me) got their food. Was told they were still working on mine. 10 more minutes pass, co-workers are halfway through their meal, and mine is nowhere. I ask again- am told again \"we're working on it, sorry, she's making it right now!\" ...10 more minutes pass. I go back to the counter to ask, again, where my order is. This time, the lady at the counter asks for my receipt, yanks it out of my hand, hastily hands it back after punching numbers on the computer saying \"you're credited back!\" then literally turns away.   So in others words: my food never got made. They didn't even TRY. Didn't even give me the soup that was already in the bowl waiting on the sandwich OR the dessert bar I bought for all of us to split. Literally just credited my card & disregarded me entirely.   I'm beyond disgusted. It was incredibly crappy sitting there hungry watching my coworkers eat. Then having to stop at Chipotle afterwards so I could at least get SOMETHING to eat for lunch. The way the employees handled it was rude & unacceptable for customer service. I understand accidents & an order being misplaced... but having to inquire THREE times only to be rudely denied what I ordered altogether left a bad taste the food will never make up for. And it's a shame because the food looked great! But the establishment, employees & customer service: HORRIBLE. Doesn't even deserve 1 star. Will not be back, nor will any of my co-workers.",

The inside is very clean and smells amazing. Everything looks so fresh and colorful. The staff  will get you through the line quickly and they all had a smile on their face.   I decided to do a combo with a full sandwich and cup of soup. The combo also includes a baguette and chocolate covered strawberry.   I picked the crab avocado melt sandwich which comes as a panini. I couldn't put this sandwich down once I picked it up!  It was extremely flavorful. The avocado and bacon made the sandwich even better than what it already was.   I did the roasted pepper and lobster soup. I will say the soups taste was awesome but I prefer a creamier soup. This soup is pretty liquidy but again it doesn't take away from the flavor. I think next time I'll try the lobster bisque to get a creamier soup.   I do like that their to go box/tray has a dip in it for the soup to be held. Which means nothing will fall over when you're carrying your box.   Ending the meal with the chocolate cover strawberry is truly the icing on the cake!  I was extremely full after this delicious meal.",

No one greeted us or said anything, even though they all looked at us when we walked in.  We stood where the line began and the employees kept on doing their own thing. I looked over the menu and decided on what I wanted. We still had not been acknowledged.   Finally, when the employee felt like it, he turned around and asked us what we wanted. I'm not sure if he was shy or what not but it was super hard to hear him.   I ended up ordering a half soup and salad and went for the Cobb salad and the tomato soup. My friend had a bowl of their chicken noodle soup and my other friend had a panini with a lobster bisque soup.  Our total was about $28.  We went down the line ordering our soups and everyone working that line seemed distracted. A few employees were having their own side conversations and the rest looked confused. The girl serving the soup definitely didn't know what she was doing. The cashier was lost when we went up to her, and far from friendly.   We found our table, sat down, and dug in. My tomato soup was cold and my Cobb salad had a weird flavor. My friend did not like the chicken noodle soup. They served him 95% broth, 3% vegetables, and 2% chicken. His soup was sad. Oh and on top of that, it was SUPER SALTY.   I will definitely not come here again. I remember the food at one point being good so idk what happened.   Good customer service is nonexistent here..",

    "text": "I really like the Cafe Zupas concept.   It's very much along the lines of MAD Greens.  And similar, in many ways to: Corner Bakery, Paradise Bakery and Panera Bread.   Cafe Zupas focuses on healthy, locally sourced meals. The salads are all well prepared, where you can add your favorite protein to it. Like Paradise where they included a soft chocolate chip cookie, here it's a dipped chocolate strawberry. Works for me!  Cafe Zupas is located on the perimeter of Chandler Mall, near P.F. Chang's on the boulevard, opposite 5 Guys, Chipotle and Jimmy Johns. I give those additional reference points, only because it's very easy to drive right past them as you come in.  My soup and salad meal, including extra protein usually runs me $10 to $13.   Enjoy",

I'm pescatarian, and specifically asked if some of the soups had any bacon or ham in them so I could avoid them.  They didn't so I ordered them, but apparently no one thought to mention that the crab and avocado sandwich had bacon.  It wasn't pictured or listed on the menu. I would not recommend this place.",

Very fresh, healthy, and we both somehow ate for $6. ( with desert...) I had salad and my son had a sandwich and we had a brownie and another fancy desert ( fancy, so I am unsure exactly what it was. Salted brulee something.. Yum!) I want to go back and try their soup. They had a lot of soup choices and they all looked good. The building looks new and was clean.

I had been to one  of these in Utah and had the  Cuban Pork sandwich and the Chicken Enchilada soup.The soup was very salty as others have said and for some reason the sandwich was just okay.  I wonder if different soups have different sodium levels, they offer samples so it is probably a good idea if you are worried about the sodium levels. Went to this location on a weekday at lunch and with 10 people n front of us still got through the line pretty quickly.  Good selection of both soups and salads, I got the Chipotle Pork and liked it a lot.  The mushroom soup was delicious, rich, and flavorful without being salty..  Definitely reminded me of Paradise Bakery  but slightly higher price and I'd rather have a cookie then a chocolate dipped strawberry.",

I ordered Lobster Bisque soup, got something that didn't look like Bisque at all, but when I asked if a mistake had been made the counter person argued with me and didn't listen to my concerns.  Ambience is mixed, they want you to feel comfortable dining in but the plastic silverware and multiple tables sitting with the remnants of meals for an extended period of time makes me feel uncomfortable and rush to leave.  The service was simply disinterested, teenagers chatting with each other and ignoring the customers.  In summary this was a hugely disappointing visit and I would strongly not recommend Zupas as a dining choice due to so-so food and very poor service.",

I wanted the half sandwich and soup combo, but got a full sandwich instead. But either I didn't speak up loud enough or I he didn't hear me over the super busy crowd.  It ended up fine because I loved my pickled Cuban sandwich + cauliflower soup!  So I was glad I had another half to enjoy the next day and it still tasted great! Each order came with a small slice of bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry! No one else does that! Plus a nice selection of tempting desserts like brownies, trifles and puddings.

It took them 5 times to make my son's sandwich correctly and all he did was ask them to substitute mayo for the honey mustard.   They never offered him anything for our inconvenience, we were all done eating by the time his sandwich was made correctly.  Ok so I was hoping it was a one time thing but of course I was wrong.  Again, this time my husband's food was messed up.  Their excuses were just that they were training.  And again, they don't care, just say sorry. I so love the cauliflower soup but my family won't go back.",

It has seemed heavy on the oils/fats the past few visits and not as flavorful.  It's still a good go-to for lunch, but not a top choice with how oily the sandwiches have been lately.",

Clean and orderly is good, too.  Loads of tasty sandwiches from which to choose? Check. An equivalent bevy of tasty salads? You know it. Scrumptious soups? All day. Decadent deserts? Awww, yeah. I've yet to find something I haven't thoroughly enjoyed and I doubt that you will, either.   If there's a negative to be had (at least for me personally), it's that they serve Coke instead of Pepsi. That's all I've got. Seriously.   Why are you still sitting there? JUST GO. You won't be disappointed.",

You do wait in line for your order and then take it to table when ready. They moved really quickly. Its kind of like paradise bakery in that you go thru the line cafeteria style, but they were much quicker w/ making the sandwiches. I had the Vegetarian Sandwich and the Tomato soup w/ Orzo. The bread was very soft and fresh as well as the rest of the ingredients, but I feel that they were really skimpy w/ the veggies :( Especially w/ a veggie sandwich I want A LOT of veggies, but it was a very thin, 1 layer of sprouts and cucumber and bell peppers. Hope they change that up a bit. The soup was very yummy though. Their combo comes w/ a whole sandwich and cup of soup, but it was a large bowl of soup so good value for money PLUS you get a chocolate covered strawberry w/ meal!! I saw an employee dipping them in the back through the glass (yummy!!) I would have given 3.5 stars, but I don't think you can.",

The clam chowder was a bit to runny for my liking but it still got eaten. The sandwiches were tasty, on fresh ciabatta rolls, one was a panini style Honey Bacon Club with turkey, ham, bacon and honey mustard, it was tasty.  The salad was a Maui Chicken Salad, it was fresh and had lots of fruit and nuts and dried coconut, the dressing was sweet and I liked it a lot. My sandwich was an Italian cold sandwich that was pretty tasty as well.  They have a lot of soup options, but most are cream style, I wish there was a basic chicken noodle.",

He brought home the bag that included the large soup, a side of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry.  The soup did NOT include the avocado, the lime or the tortilla strips!  I called the Chandler location he visited and the employee that answered the phone just said something along the lines of \"oh sorry, its complimentary, they must have forgotten to add it to the bag, it's a busy time right now\" I said \"ok, well it's suppose to come with the soup right?\" And she basically just said \"yeah it's complimentary\" - but is it really complimentary if it's listed as ingredients of the soup and pictured on the menu????  Is it complimentary if you pay for the soup and it's suppose to come with it?  She offered that I come back to the restaurant to pick up my \"complimentary\" items, but I am sick, which is why I didn't go get it myself in the first place!  I told her I was expecting some kind of gesture more than just an \"I'm sorry\" and she said \"oh I'm sorry\"  I have never had worse customer service for a screwed up take out order.  I will be going to Panera from here out.  The most mind boggling part is how they forgot the ingredients for the soup but managed to remember a side of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry.  And \"it was busy, they forgot\" isn't exactly any excuse or gesture of remorse if you ask me!  I basically didn't get what we PAID for, items are not complimentary if they are included in the menu description and photo of the menu item!!",

    "text": "C and I stopped in here because his school was doing a charity fundraiser. We had never been to a Cafe Zuppas before so we were both newbies. I have to point out that this location is not in the best spot if you're trying to find parking. It can be hard to find a spot depending on time of day/night. If you're gutsy, you can always park across the \"ring\" at the end of the parking rows for the mall. Good luck darting across the 4 lanes of mall traffic but... C & I were lucky enough to find some parking. Probably because it was raining which kept the crowds down. After we entered C went to find a table. Aside from the fact that it was a fundraiser night there were quite a few tables that needed to be cleaned. I personally saw plenty of employees available but it was more like a meeting of high schoolers, standing around giggling, pointing at each other, etc... strange behavior at a restaurant. Regardless, C grabbed the only clean table he could find. At least he found one. I stepped up to the young lady taking orders and told her I had never been here before. I got this look like, \"so\", what do you want me to do. I think she was related to the girl who worked at Kneaders who gave me the same deer in headlights stare. Now, while I was waiting to get up to the counter, I had a chance to check out the menu. There were a lot of things that sounded quite yummy. A great selection of sandwiches, salads and soups. It was still a bit warm outside for soup so that didn't interest me. What did interest me was the Honey Cilantro Carnitas sandwich. Anytime I see pork on a menu, I immediately gravitate towards it. And Carnitas is one of my favorite foods. Yum. But before I ordered I noticed they have a great deal. For $8.79 you can have a whole sandwich and half soup or salad. The half salad alone costs $5.59 so you're getting a full sandwich for a little over 3 bones. Wow. I'm immediately suspicious when a deal seems to good to be True but there was a salad that sounded super good as well so I decided to go for the Combo. I stepped up and ordered the \"Try Two Combo\" with the Honey Cilantro Carnitas sandwich and the Cherry Balsamic Chicken salad. \"We're out of Pork\". That's what the girl tells me. They can't do anything on the menu that has pork in it because they don't have any pork. Aaaaaaargghhhhhhhh. Seriously? No pulled pork, no Cuban? What else is there? Some dumb chicken sandwich. (I'm kidding here, I love Chicken but I was bummmmed) I ordered the Combo with the Vegetarian sandwich (just to spite them, kidding) and the Cherry Balsamic Chicken salad for me. The sandwich was a bit wimpy. Just another place that kind of jips you on a vegetarian sandwich. It should be loaded with sprouts, cucumbers, tomatoes & lettuce. And then add in the roasted red peppers and Muenster cheese. But instead it's a sad portion of veggies on bread that was overall a bit disappointing. I reminded myself, however, that the sandwich only cost a bit over 3 bucks. So ok, for that price, it's an ok sandwich. Now, the salad was AMAZING. Next time I will just order a full size of this salad. Field Greens, chunked Chicken, Grapes, Goat Cheese, Anjou Pears, Almonds, & Dried Bing Cherries with Cherry Balsamic Vinaigrette on the side. Oh my gosh was it a good salad. Loved it. The greens were fresh, everything added to it was fresh and the dressing was very tasty. Not too sweet which I was glad to discover. Winner winner Cherry Balsamic Chicken salad dinner. I ordered C the Kids meal combo ($3.99). He got to choose two of four items. He picked the Grilled Cheese sandwich and fruit cup. This is THE DEAL when it comes to kid's meal. For a penny shy of 4 bucks he got a great sandwich, a nice cup of mandarin orange slices, a drink and a chocolate dipped strawberry. Lets just say C was a happy camper. Messy Dining room, Out of Pork (sin), average at best vegetarian sandwich, Amazing salad, fair prices, sketchy staff, lousy parking. 2.5 Stars.",

I was very pleased with the enthusiastic and friendly employees. got a salad and soup which I found both to be very fresh and tasty. Each meal also comes with a chocolate covered strawberry, what a great ending to a meal!",

    "text": "I hate to rate this place 3 stars because I think the idea/execution is pretty spot on.  Good fresh food at very reasonable prices.   I have to ding this place because of the staff though... Every time I come here they just don't feel welcoming and I seem to get that 'please get me out of here' attitude. With so many options and ways to customize your food the staff needs to be patient, kind, and helpful during the ordering process. Instead every time I get to the counter they just stare at me blankly and awkwardly while I start to feel the pressure and end up just picking the first thing that sounds good. I know it can't be easy dealing with indecisive people all day but just give me a \"No rush!\" Or \"Let me know if you need any help!\" or something instead the glaring monotonous hatred I feel every time I'm here. (Okay maybe that was overboard)  My girlfriend was building a salad and asked for some of the shredded mozzarella and the lady blankly replied \"That's not mozzarella\"... That's it.  No \"It's actually jack\" or \"we have mozzarella over here!\"  All of the interactions just seemed slightly forced and awkward and I just got the feeling that they really disliked the guests.  All in all I'll probably be back because I still like the food, concept and the price. Just remember that when you don't like your job it shows more than you think.",

The variety is fairly good and all of the ingredients were very fresh. I had the Cobb salad with avocado and their homemade herb vinaigrette. The portion size was excellent for the price, and it came with rolls and a chocolate covered strawberry for dessert. The restaurant is bright and clean inside, and the service was very friendly for a casual spot (think Chick Fil A).",

How does a restaurant open a location next to a major mall and have it closed on one of the two busiest traffic/shopping days of the week? If you are a mom and pop type establishment and don't want to work Sundays then open in a mom and pop location where people don't go out on Sunday. i'll support restaurants that want everyone's business and doesn't discriminate on Sundays.",

Everything here screams \"FRESH!\" The clam chowder had fresh chunks of potato and veggies. The clam was real clam, not processed cubes of clam product. The salad was mixed fresh by hand right in front of me, the baguette slice was a nice touch and the chocolate-covered strawberry was a classy treat.  Also, I was skeptical about cinnamon anything on my berry salad. Try it. Delicious.",

The salads are amazing, the sandwiches are filling, and the soups are sublime for a causal dining place. And they give you a chocolate coated strawberry with each meal. Their infused drinks with honey are the bomb. Oh, one day I decided to try their brulee -- yep, they just stopped the hazelnut one. Boo for me, and I didn't want their seasonal pumpkin one so I had their fruit one. OMG..yes!  I swear I had their strawberry harvest salad everyday with the exception of trying the berries and nuts one day, and their Wisconsin Cauliflower soup everyday. I want the recipe for the strawberry champagne vingerette--Zupa Gods...do you hear me? I had their carnita sandwich -- boy was it huge and filling? I don't get why you get a full sandwich on the combo but the other choice is just a half salad or half soup. I think one ought to get a full salad with a half sandwich and half soup. Anyhoo--as you're opening in the Midwest...know that the DMV needs you here. We need more than Panera! Come on!",

    "text": "Great variety.... overall the food is good and worth a try. My only problems with Cafe Zupas- 1. They claim to be a healthy option yet provide everyone a roll and chocolate covered strawberry- without any healthy substitutes. 2. This location always seems like organized chaos. The lines are long and your food disappears while you're standing in the line... and you hope you get to find the food you ordered by the time you check out. 3. Their tables and chairs seem cheap and chipped- the furniture isn't well maintained. 4. They don't post any calorie info- they have great looking soups- but I have never tried any because they aren't able to give me any idea what kind of calories or ingredients are in the soups (this goes back to #1 with they claim to be healthy but don't show it).",

While waiting for said tomatoes I see two employees through some windows working in the back and thinking to myself \"surely those two are not responsible for the tomatoes because there is no sense of urgency whatsoever considering there's a customer waiting and they are working extremely slowly and having a conversation while they stop working at times\" but nope I was wrong, the gentleman was the one responsible for cutting tomatoes. Finally when he got around to it, it took him 30 seconds to cut them and have them out. I waited all that time for him to finish whatever else he found more important then got to giving the front employees what they needed to finished making a sandwich. Really ridiculous! The only reason I gave them two stars and not one is because I actually like their food too bad customers are not all that important. I should also add that the employees in the front offered me a drink while I wait and a creme brulee but I didn't want any of those I just wanted my sandwich so I can head to my destination.",
