Our service was rather slow and non-existent at time for a very long period of time. This sucked because we sat at the bar for the very reason of quick service. They were literally having a meeting behind the bar with a lady with a folder and a pen discussing their payroll right in front of us rather than attend to us and take our order. I know this is a small place but please, hold these meetings on the beautiful patio or before/after hours and pay attention to your patrons. With that being said, the food quality was good, the portions were good and that about sums it up.",

So much so that my daughter forced me to share. I highly recommend it. My daughters grilled cheese was also very good. It had a sweet flavor I enjoyed but some may think different. My wife's pasta had spicy sausage and was ok but my daughters and I dishes were the winners. Overall, I was impressed with some very good food but even more impressive was the staff.

It wasn't very busy when we went on a weeknight after work. They had some happy hour drink specials so we each ended up getting a Pear Cider to start off with. There were a few different food options on special as well, but we opted to order off the menu for dinner.  I ordered the Chicken Pesto sandwich with french fries and my friend ordered the 1/2 salad (Pear Cobb) and 1/2 pasta (Tuscan Rigatoni). The salad came out & looked really good. It was pretty large too for a half salad (completely missed the chance of snagging a photo)! My friend said the salad was good & the pasta was just okay. As far as my order goes, I thought the sandwich was okay. The ciabatta bread wasn't toasted which I wish it would've been and the chicken was a bit dry. I actually picked it all off so that was a miss for me, I wouldn't order it again.  There were quite a few interesting options on the menu though that I'd be willing to give this place another chance. For now though, three stars!",

When we requested patio seating she offered us the one table in the direct sunlight. She was clearly annoyed with our request for a shadier table and told us \"Well, pick whatever seat you want!\"  Dishing up plenty of sass and attitude before we ever sit down is not a great way to welcome guests. She tossed the menus down on the table and yelled over her shoulder to another server \"I don't have a server for this table pick whoever you want to serve them.\"   We left before we would be anymore of an inconvenience.",

The have different soups each day, and usually at least one vegetarian one on the menu.   Tapas: Pesto Goat Cheese Crostini and Pear Pico de Gallo Perfect sized portions at excellent prices. The pico was a very different spin, but very refreshing.   Entree: Perfect Grilled Cheese The best grilled cheese sandwich I've had in the Tempe area. Try it for yourself!   The drinks are great too! Highly recommend the Pear Mule and Pomegranate Mojito.   PS: Happy Hour is 11-6 everyday at this location! The other locations are 2-6, so definitely maximize on this!",

    "text": "We visited the Perfect Pear Bistro on June 1 for an early dinner prior to seeing a play at ASU Gammage.  This place is a fantastic option if you have plans near ASU.  They offer free parking and it is very easy to get in, eat and be on your way.  We chose to eat inside due to the heat but their patio is large, covered and so beautiful.  We were greeted immediately by a friendly hostess and offered a table near a window.  Our server stopped by for initial drink orders without any delay.  They have a really wonderful selection of vegetarian options rather than the typical one or two menu items often seen in many places.  We ordered the buffalo cauliflower, carnitas tacos and the Paco's pear tacos along with sides of a broccoli salad.  Everything tasted amazing.....especially those little sides of broccoli salad!  (I may have licked the bowl, lol!).  Prices are reasonable and ongoing follow up service throughout the meal was attentive and just right for us.  Definitely stop by and support this awesome local business if you are in the Tempe area!!",

    "text": "I'm giving more stars than I want to because the venue is cute. My friend had reserved a table for about eight the day before, but when our party arrived, there were a lot of confused looks from the waitresses, basically saying, \"What reservation?\" It took a lot longer for this situation to be remedied as well because one waitress would look to another waitress to handle the situation. We were also forced to sit outside, and it's not exactly the best time of year to be having a meal outside.   Finally, they pushed some tables together. I ordered the Jalapeno grilled cheese with sweet potato fries [~10], which was spicier than I thought it would be. The sweet potato fries were quite good! My friend's grilled cheese came out cold, but it took nearly forever to track down a server. They just wouldn't come to check up on us for the longest time.   Even though Perfect Pear had made a mistake, we weren't compensated in any way. Service was disorganized, rude, and inefficient.   The venue isn't ideal for large groups either. The tables are two-seaters and some are pushed together to seat four people.   I was actually really disappointed in my experience today because I quite liked the Ahwatukee location.",

I probably wouldn't come back here for more unless I was in the mood for salad.   What I had:  Baja lime salad - Huge salad with quinoa, beans, cucumbers, onions and assorted greens. My favorite item here, the lime vinaigrette was delicious and had me wanting more!   Mediterranean mac n cheese - pesto cream mac with sun dried tomatoes and onions. I didn't really taste any cheese so that kind of bummed me out.   My boyfriend had a sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was dry and not very flavorful. The sweet potato fries are worth it however.",

This cafe is close to the movie theater, which is great.   I ordered the Bacon and Jalapeno Grilled Cheese. The bread, nine-grain, was nicely grilled with Romano cheese on the outside and cream cheese on the inside (think jalapeno popper). The Sweet Potato Fries were equally nicely cooked. They were cut thin with a crinkle pattern, for extra crispness. Good seasoning as well. It was well thought out and creative: a really good mix of flavors.   My kids got a Quad City Melt with seasonal fruit (watermelon, feta and seeds) and a Chicken Marsala Sandwich with fries. Both were excellent combos, with savory 'shrooms and meats tucked inside the fresh bread.   Our service was spot on, knowing that we were catching a movie. She was efficient and effective.   I recommend PPB to anyone for a quality, creative meal with good service and many gluten free options.",

Was a little confused where to go in for my first time, found the doorway followed by a cute sunny/shady patio depending on which mood you're going for or what time of the day you decide to stop in. This place is pup friendly, which to me is a BONUS especially for my little Stella. The ambience was very chill and low key when I went, it could be a girly brunch or a casual but romantic date night too. To my surprise, it was happy hour so yes that's a thing here! I ordered the Raspberry mojito which most definitely added to my refreshing bites. For tapas we got the pesto goat cheese which was great! At first I was a little disappointed because we only got three little crostini breads to dip it in, but since our waitress was awesome she was on top of the game and offered more for our extra dip to not go to waste! We also got the cauliflower nachos which were interesting! I would have never thought to combine these ingredients prior to ordering this! It was interesting at first but then grew on me and ended up being a nice light snack. Afterwards, we ordered the pulled pork sandwich was also did not fail me. The dishes here, in my opinion are very unique and fresh. I love the chill vibes to the place and that I can bring my pup. Definitely explore this little hidden gem.",

He didn't even stay long enough to tell me to please enjoy my food or ask if he could get me anything else and didn't come back by to see how it was. I am a chef. I trained at Le Cordon Bleu and it is my dream to have this exact type of bistro. I would appreciate every person so much and be very attentive knowing Yelpers can make you or break you.

Tonight we came to dinner, my son and husband. The drink I ordered tasted like cough syrup completely undrinkable, when I tried to order a beer they were out of the one I wanted and They couldn't get the tap to pour correctly on the second one I asked for. My husband ordered a pasta dish we order every time  we come. The sauce was straight water and it didn't look close to anything we have eaten before. I never send food back but tonight we did and instead of \"remaking\" it like we were told it would be all they did was drain the watery sauce and send it out again. My husband and I hardly ate our meal and took it to go just so we can throw it away. I don't like to complain because I always feel terrible but the staff couldn't even offer an apology. I paid a decent amount of money to not eat or drink a thing. We will not be back and I hope next time they can use this for customer service training. Thank you perfect pair for ruining our family dinner that we don't always get to enjoy.",

I ordered the black and blue Brussels sprouts, marsala pasta with chicken, and kids quesadilla with fries for my son. When the appetizers came up, some guy who was helping getting food out to tables walked by and set some buffalo cauliflower (don't name of appetizer) and said something real fast and walked away before I could even tell him it wasn't ours. Less than a minute later my waitress comes with our right appetizer and I tell her about the mistake which she promptly removes. The brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly, but I felt like there was too much blue cheese so if I ever go back I'd ask for no cheese next time. My marsala pasta was extremely disappointing, while the sauce was reminiscent of a marsala dish, it was so watery and soupy, it didnt even stick to my pasta. My chicken was just ok, nothing amazing. I really love pasta so this was upsetting for me. My sons fries tasted better than the pasta. He seemed to enjoy his food. I highly doubt I would come back, I'm not sure why this place has such good reviews but I only stopped here because it was along the way to an errand I was running and had good reviews.",

Beer selection good. Service timing perfect. Easily could do a work lunch and get back on time.",

Our waiter was excellent; however (and this is the reason for 4 stars, not 5), the courses sort of ran into each other.  We weren't even halfway done with the appetizer when the soup was delivered.  Then we weren't' complete with the appetizer or soup when the entree came.  It was only mildly annoying and the server apologized profusely and blamed himself...wow...someone that actually takes accountability for something rather than blaming the kitchen.  Anyway...I will definitely be taking other friends to this restaurant and my tip for you that might try this place is to NOT miss the Hummus Nacho's as an appetizer.  I know it doesn't sound great...but it's a taste fiesta in your mouth and thus far, has been the best thing on the menu that I've tried.",

Luckily, my boyfriend checked prior to eating since the order was wrong. We kindly asked for it to be re-made and dish was half the size, cold, and lacking in taste.

It's as if they are not prepared for a busy lunch rush, and as a result are forced to either dissuade people from having lunch there, or worse, not serve to the level of expectation. I mention this because my colleagues and I went there of course, and undoubtedly so, they told us \"yea you might not want to stay here if your on break\" in which I could appreciate the concern but it came off as if they didn't want the business. I'd rather make that decision or come to that conclusion myself, not be told as if I'm being told to leave.. Once again, the food and prices make up for the laps in service, but it's unfortunate that they are lacking in that particular area...",

It's a lively place, and a nice place to meet someone for a meal.  We sat at the bar, ordered some nice beers, and ordered our lunch. I had the Carnitas Tacos with pulled pork. Not as good as it looked, mostly ordinary and a little dry. But I was in the mood for pulled pork and it went down good.  My business friend got the marble Cuban sandwich with roasted pulled pork, mustard and cheese. He said it was good but nothing over-the-top.

From Roasted Squash Tacos, Green Chili Mac, and Quinoa Bowls, they definitely have fun in the kitchen with this menu.  I however can be a sucker for grilled cheese sandwiches and they seem to have plenty on the menu.  I shot for the Grilled Goodness; roasted butternut squash, bacon, caramelized onions, arugula, and four cheese blend on a crusted 9 grain bread.  Overall, a solid bite of grilled cheese with the extra ingredients like the crispy and saltiness of the bacon and strong earthy scent and taste of the arugula.  The roasted squash was mellow, but definitely provided and rustic sense to the sandwich.  My dilemma with the sandwich was it was light on the cheese, which I thought they could have added an extra layer.  The sandwich also came with side and I choose the fruit salad; which was good, but man the crinkle cut flat sweet potato fries were crispy to the bite!  Love me some crispy fries and thanks to my buddy that shared.    In the end, Perfect Pear Bistro had a fun menu and also afterwards I didn't feel like over ate.  Matter fact the menu made me feel lighter and refreshed.  I love their patio area which provided a brunch like atmosphere and while the interior was rustic and had an Arizona western like feel. - Enjoy!",

I was reading and didn't mind the wait, and When she asked, I responded that I was ready to order completely and she rolled her eyes and said 'ok, but can I have your drink order?' which left me taken aback. I gave her my drink order and asked if I could tell her my dish since I had been waiting so long, to which she replied she had a couple of tables ahead of me and she needed to allow them to order first. She could tell by my face that I was perplexed, so she rolled her eyes AGAIN, and while filling my water said 'fine. Give me your order and I guess I'll put it in while I'm trying to make your drink.' She was so incredibly rude and I was so taken aback that I just got up and left. This is really unfortunate because I've loved coming here and I use PP often to cater for my company. I'll definitely be taking a break and hope the woman who was tending understands how ridiculous she was being, as well as incredibly rude. All I wanted was a freakin' grilled cheese sandwich.",

There was 7 of us & the wait staff was all over taking care of our AZ visitors - from the constant refills of their delicious iced peach green tea to splitting our orders on 2 different plates to taking our group picture at the end of our visit.  We sampled a variety of menu items... salads, jalapeno & bacon grilled cheese, sandwiches, Cubano sandwich & oh, those sweet potato fries! Yum!! I wish I had room for dessert. Something to look forward to because we'll be back!! If you're here in the cooler months... try out their patio - so lovely. Enjoy",

There was a spray can of the kind of deodorizer that works by deadening taste/smell laying out to complete the assault on my pleasant mood.

Based on the reviews I was eager to try this place to see what it was all about. I ordered the Baja like salad. The presentation was nice, all the colors of the rainbow on my plate. As for flavor, it was just okay. The dressing didn't have much flavor and as the name might suggest, I didn't taste much lime. My friend ordered pesto Mac and cheese which I tasted and it was good although I didn't taste any cheese. It seemed more like a pesto pasta dish than a Mac and cheese pasta dish. Overall this place is just okay. I would probably return if someone wanted to meet up there but unlikely that I'll go back on my own",

Not that I am a woman of leisure by any means but this location is not too far from my office but still just outside of the ASU bubble so if I am meeting a friend they won't have to deal with the parking or traffic issues. They have really fantastic salads so that is my go-to option. You can choose from 2 different choices of base greens and a protein but then each has it's own distinct flavor due to the additional veggies, add-ons, and housemade dressing. My favorite is the Baja Lime with house blend greens (kale and spinach) and add shrimp. They also have a fantastic unsweetened iced green tea. Everyone that I have eaten with here has loved the food. The service is always pretty good too. They also have a lovely patio that is even doable in the summer due to the fans and misters.",

I wish i could scream it off of south mountain to let all of the Phoenix area know that the crispest bacon, lettuce, tomato, AVOCADO and spicy mayo sauce sandwich IS HERE. I'm such an avocado person and of course, who doesn't love GOOD bacon (not that saggy, soggy, floppy shit you get at some places) this bacon is salty, crunchy, tasty and not burnt or fatty at all. My boyfriend and I don't go out to eat that often but we ALWAYS make this sandwich a priority on the weekends when we are able to go together. Also, I'm especially happy to say that he surprised me tonight by picking it up and bringing it home and the sandwich withheld the ride. (You know how that goes, you get something on the go or pick it up and it's half way icky by the time your home) oh, i didn't even talk about the bread yet - all I'm going to say is, it's worth the carbs",

Aside from the sounds of the cars driving 10 feet from your ears, I feel like I'm transported out of Arizona and into some adorable country side restaurant. Huge plus that it's pup-friendly too. This is my second time here and both times my husband and I ordered the Pear Mule - not too sweet, not too strong...it's juust right! Last time I got the Harvest Sandwich which was major noms, but this time I hit the jackpot with the Peanut Coconut Curry Quinoa Bowl. I think this would be great as a wrap as well. This will pair well with the colder temps in the upcoming months. I've got my eye on the Baja Lime and the Berry Avocado bowl for my next visit. Overall, if you want a cute place to eat clean I would highly recommend this place. Both times our bill was around $35 for 2 meals, and 2 drinks. (Happy hour the pear mule is $6.5 compared to $8 for the regular pricing)",

    "text": "Ambiance: Very subtle, well thought out to bring out comfort and ease to customers. The photo taken from the seat I was at could've been mistaken for a restaurant overseas. Service: Does not exactly have the A-game on. We got here at 45min before closing with only 2 other tables indoors. The water/wine girl ended up getting our order in and disclosed she was not confident if she could get it right. The salad came within a reasonable time, but the mains came right after before we could finish our salad. 15min before close, as I'm finishing my pasta, the server dropped off the bill without asking if we need anything else (more drinks, dessert, etc) Food: For the price of $12.49 and getting a decent sized salad and pasta at a full service restaurant, there's not much to complain. Not a full flavor, but was fresh. Definitely packaged  pasta was used. No fresh ground pepper or parmesan is offered. Table side salt and pepper is hard to come out. Grilled cheese was good with pesto and vegetables, but timing of food lost the gooey aspect.",

She can't get enough of the butternut squash tacos. I ordered the Quinoa bowl with roasted veggies and pesto. The food was hot; however, the bowl was SWIMMING in oil. The flavor of this dish is so strong and heavy. It definitely needed a LOT less oil and more quinoa to distribute the flavor. I told the waitress that it had too much oil ( you could see it and spoon it up in the bowl) and she acknowledged that the cook was brand new and didn't quite have the recipes down yet. But she did not offer to give us a discount or refund, or a free dessert which would have made me feel a bit better. I would not choose to go back here (although i probably will for my daughter).",

Soups, salads, sandwiches, and even pasta dishes.  They have a list of grilled cheese sandwiches that I wish I could eat because they sound delicious (I have sensitivities to milk products), but I just might one of these days.  We had the Tukee Pear, which is a quesadilla and it was just perfect.  I had the French Pantry, which was delicious and my friend had the Creamy Butternut Rigatoni, which I got to try and it was scrumptious!  For dessert our server recommended the Peach Cobbler, which was sweet and mouthwatering!  We went on a Monday night and were seated right away.  Service was friendly, although it was slow, but I have come to learn that good food takes time, and we had nothing but time when we went. :)",

I've tried a number of salads and pastas here, and one or two sandwiches/grilled cheeses, and liked everything I've gotten.   The outdoor patio is beautiful, and there's always plenty of open seating. The indoor restaurant has a really nice atmosphere, too.

Here are a couple of my experiences...  I called in an order for pickup the next day. The order was for 7-8. I knew not to ask them to put peoples names on each meal as they made it very clear with a previous pickup order that they couldn't do that. So, this time I asked if they could identify the dishes so we would know how to match the meal to the person. You know, put initials on the containers. Her reply with a sigh and tone of frustration speaking so fast I could hardly understand \"Well that's our busiest time! We won't have time to do that!\" I felt like I was asking way too much and she made it very clear! If they don't label their meals, there is a way to let people know without making them feel like a burden.  Another time (keep in mind this is a 2 min. conversation at the most) I called in a takeout order and she assumed I wanted it immediately. She never asked what time I would like to pick it up so after placing the order, I told her I would be picking it up in an hour. Again, talking so fast I had to ask her to repeat herself. With a sigh and again talking so fast I could hardly understand, she said with frustration in her tone- \"well! The order has already been sent back. I'll have to tell them!\" I felt like I did something wrong or required too much. I felt like a burden! She was so put out that she had to recall the order and she wanted me to know it!",

I got pesto goat cheese to start. The goat cheese was really good but the bread wasn't very good, just tasted like kinda stale plain bread. For my meal I got the buffalo falafel sandwich. It was good but there was a little too much sauce on it, I'd ask for it on the side next time. Sweet potato fries were some of the best I've had, perfectly crunchy. I also got to have a couple bites of the butternut squash pasta (without bacon) and it was very good, though I think I liked my sandwich more. Service was good, a little slow but not too bad. We sat outside and it was pretty with all the little lights! Prices aren't bad either, I'd come back here to try more vegetarian dishes!",

They have an expansive patio and good-sized indoor area as well, so it is really good for large groups, especially if you don't have a reservation. Chances are that you will be able to sit down right away. The best part is that it is so dang cute! They have beautiful string lights and the patio is so nicely decorated.  Every time I have gone here, I have gotten different kinds of their pasta. Its nothing to special, but definitely satisfying and fine for what you're paying for. I like their gma's mac n' cheese (probably because I'm a mac n' cheese fiend.) They also have a pretty good drink menu, and I haven't been dissapointed from any of the drinks I've had there. I personally like their pear mule, it has a good kick with the right amount of alcohol. Their desserts are also pretty good! This is a good place for birthday dinners and things of that nature.",

So ... I'm so glad I found the Perfect Pear Bistro!  We've been doing an event once a week in Tempe, and we're finding each time we just want to go back to the PPB.  Shishito Peppers!  YUM - inspired me so much I bought some and tried them at home.  Your's are better!  Buffalo Cauliflower - a little over the top on the Buffalo - but oh my!  Yum!  I've tried this at home as well - I kind of like mine - with a Feta/Cream/Goat cheese dip.. but I'll order again!  I've had your Tomato Basil soup - very well done - tasty without going over the top - I could still taste the tomato - but it was in no way bland!  The specialty drinks we have had are fantastic! But I have to say my favorite was the Bacon Jalapeno sandwich.  Y U M !!!    Can't wait for my next visit!",

Plus Yelp reviewer's gave it 4.5 stars.   You can order ala cart or pick a pair.  One bowl of soup plus a salad, one salad plus a pasta, one bowl of soup plus a pasta, BUT you cannot get half a sandwich with either pasta, salad or soup.  I think that should be an option. But no matter. My wife got the tomato basil soup and the pair salad. She loved both, and was impressed how many ingredients were in the salad ( nuts berries, pair, cheese).  I ordered the curry chicken soup (coconut milk) and a sandwich of chicken, bacon, and avocado.  The sandwich was terrific, but the star of the show was the soup. It was flat out one of the best soups I've had. It was a bit spicy, but I cooled the fire with the house speciality drink- a pair martini.  They have 3 locations, we went to the one on University,  but all 3 get 4.5 stars. We had  5 star meal and service",

The restaurant has indoor and outdoor dining with heaters and a fireplace but it was too cold to be outside. The inside has a rustic feel with lower lighting which i personally like. There isn't a set hostess stand which was kind of awkward when you walk in and don't know where to go. However we were quickly addressed by a waitress and told to sit anywhere with silverware.   There's a good amount of menu items which i like and we had a tough time deciding what to get. We decided on the bahn mi sandwich with fries (the waitress did ask if we wanted to do half sweet potato and half regular which was super appreciated because both were great). The regular fries were thin, fresh and salty kinda like McDonald's fries but more home style. And the sweet potato fries were a mix between steak and waffle fries. Both delicious- just like the sandwich which came with a special mayo. We also got the lemon pasta which hit the spot and had a huge portion. My only critique would be it was a bit oily. I told the waitress i had a severe dairy allergy which she didn't seem to completely be knowledgeable about but she did seem to care and made sure she'd ask the kitchen which is all i can ask. One waitress did even let me read a label which made me feel safe. I will say that one criticism was moving tables and talking about gossip loudly was kind of annoying as we were finishing our meal but then again i remember what it's like to be anxious to leave a shift. Overall great food and atmosphere just a little polishing on other points.",

The ingredients and flavors are impeccable. I didn't even have time to get a picture of the amazing food since I jumped right in.  I had the chicken club and usually I'm all for the a fried chicken club but figured I'd try out their grilled chicken. Everything was amazing including the fries. Many of their recipes have ingredients you typically wouldn't see on a certain dish but they all mesh so well. Adding on my list of places to come to again in the future!",

The menu was amazing and since I had a hard time choosing, I went with a tapas size appetizer to start (buffalo falafel...so delicious!) then the 1/2 salad and 1/2 pasta selection.  Both so good and WAY bigger than I would ever expect half size portions to be.  I will 100% come back next time I'm in town.",

It's genuinely good food and reasonably priced. The flavors are nicely balanced and if you like lighter, healthy fare then this is the place for you. The patio also has a nice ambiance to it.

I went with a Quinoa bowl with strawberries and I enjoyed all the items and flavors of its ingredients.   I also felt that the portion size and price were right on.  Not only that, I felt the items were original and weren't the same as other quinoa bowls I've had elsewhere.  My only criticism is that I think different fruit should be used instead of the strawberries (like dried cherries or something) because they didn't add much flavor.  My dinner date really enjoyed his pasta.  There's something for everyone on the menu.  Service was good.  A small mistake was made on our order and was promptly resolved; no complaints!",

Good drink menu too, the Pinot Grigio was delicious! I got the Cuban with a side salad which was impressive! Not just lettuce and dressing! Food was so good! A family with an infant got in at 9:00 and the waitress told them they close in 15 minutes and that there was restaurants open on Mill. Everything was great up until this point. The restaurant closes at 9:30 per their website. I found this extremely rude and unprofessional coming from a restaurant background we always served up until we closed. I was surprised and disappointed. This place was pretty awesome for our first visit!",

Hostess greeted us... if you wanted to call it a greeting.. with a sour puss on her face, mumbled something, and got annoyed when we didn't answer.  She got exasperated and said \"huh??!\".   Server was pleasant enough, not all that friendly though.  At one point came over to table and took my plate that still had food in it.  Didn't even ask if I was finished or wanted a to go box.  I've given this place plenty of chances as I love the menu and food is always very good.  But after today's service I likely will not be back.  The hostess was particularly rude.

    "text": "Oh my lord! Found this place on Yelp because I was in the Tempe area for a meeting. I ordered the quad city melt, with perfectly cooked roast beef, sauteed mushrooms, cheese, and a spicy chipotle mayo. The combinations of flavors were so damn good, I had to stop myself from overeating! I got the sweet potato fries as a side and they were cooked perfectly! Crispy, not too salty, and honestly the best I've had ever. Can't wait to come back and try their other sandwiches and salads! Great beers on tap and wine too. A++. Service was good, the only minuscule thing I could suggest would be to play some music other than what they were playing. But, it is just down the street from a college campus, so maybe I'm alone in this. The patio is gorgeous and interior decor is very inviting. Change up the music!",

The prices aren't bad and the food quality is superb.  My wife had a grilled cheese with sweet potato fries.  The fries maybe were a little over-cooked, but nothing to complain about.  I had their cobb salad and shrimp corn chowder soup.  Our only regret is there is not a Perfect Pear Bistro in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "I really enjoy the food at this neighborhood spot and (used to) come for happy hour often with my ladies. The patio always has a nice vibe, with guests and their doggos hanging out with a glass of wine despite it being a million degrees outside.   On my last visit, my card was charged an additional 9$ (assuming the server tipped herself). I didn't tip on the card because I left cash. I did email them and the manager did respond promptly asking me to give him a call. But eh, it's 9 bucks and by the time I saw his email, I had been out of town for a week. Didn't seem worth it to call. I just doubt that I'll ever go back. It left a bad taste in my mouth and I hope the server realizes losing her job isn't worth such a small amount of money. Any respectable establishment has their servers go through their receipts at the end of the night in order to avoid any potential mistakes like this.   There's too many cool places around the valley that also have delicious food to bother coming here again and receive lackluster (and either dishonest or careless) service. Looking back on all my experiences here, the service is the one thing that stands out in a negative way. This was my first time sitting at a table, but none of the bartenders are ever friendly or even behind the bar to be helpful. Where do all the servers disappear off to?? The atmosphere is nice and the managers on duty always seem to be engaged with what's going on in the dining room and I really appreciate that as I come from a restaurant background myself.   The food IS tasty though, and I was looking forward to trying everything on the menu at some point... All of the appetizers are wonderful. On our last visit, my friends and I all got different pasta dishes. If you do go, I'd recommend the Mediterranean Mac & Cheese - I ate every stinkin' bite. I remember the Creamy Mushroom Marsala being extremely flavorful and delicious as well, and I don't particularly even enjoy mushrooms!",

Upon entering the back door however, we were drawn into the quaint, shaded patio. Plenty of seating there and comfortable enough to sit all afternoon.   The dining room was small and comfortable. The bar, lighting and music all set for the perfect ambiance. We were greeted and seated promptly and the service throughout the meal was superb.   The menu upon first glance was impressively healthy & a far cry from the usual burgers and bar fair. Yes, they have sandwiches, salads and wraps but the ingredients and layers are above and beyond ordinary.   If you're in the Tempe area, you must stop here for lunch or HH!   Tip! Try the Pizza Bread, it's amazing!",

Tip #1 - Sit outside if the weather isn't too warm.  They've got a beautiful patio area with plenty of shade.  The menu has a lot of options.  I went with the chicken pesto sandwich.  Overall it was decent, but could have used a little more of the pesto sauce.  The ciabatta bread was a little dry.  I should have tried what my friends had which was the lemon garlic pasta. Portions are average in size.  There is convenient street parking nearby and like I mentioned earlier, the distillery next door if you want to pop by and get a drink.  Tip #2 - Check your food before you eat it.  My friend had a hair on her plate.  Luckily she saw it and it was sitting on the side of her food so it was probably from the waitress.  Still, not something you like to see.",

I had the perfect pear classic with the house blend of greens along with chicken in a wrap with sweet potato fries.   My son had the strawberry fields salad with salmon.  The pear/chicken wrap is actually the salad but in a wrap.   Interesting concept.   I asked them to leave out the onions and mint.   Perfect!   There is a lot of chicken in the wrap, a light amount of dressing that matches the salad wrap to perfection, and, therefore, does not make it drippy and soggy.   The pear is sweet and crunchy.  The sweet potato fries were hot and tasty.  We sat out on the patio.   This is the time of the year we can do that.   The service is a bit on the slow side, especially since most people are on a tight timeline for lunch.   Overall, I'd say the food outweighed the service.   We'll be back.",

    "text": "Perfect Pear Bistro is a lovely place for brunch, lunch, or even linner( lunch+dinner ). During my last visit to AZ, I was fortunate enough to give this place a try after reading my fellow Yelpers reviews. Boy, was I glad I went for it! My dad and I enjoyed this place so much we came back two days in a row!   The place: They have ample seating, we sat outdoors which I recommend as the misters and fans make it enjoyable.  Food: Tacos, salad, bowls, and sandwiches! My first thought when looking at the menu was, what do I even order!? It was so hard to choose just one thing, there were so many great options. Both times I went I ordered tacos: falafel & carnitas . I honestly think you can't really go wrong with any thing on the menu. Service: Throughout our experience, the service was exceptional! We ordered iced tea, and my father and I joked about how every few sips we got another refill! They were so kind and attentive.  Thanks Perfect Pair Bistro!",

    "text": "Great variety of food and a decent lunch spot.   My go to is usually one of the pasta dishes. Gma's mac is good but it's not mind-blowing mac and cheese but it does the job. Tony's Pasta is creamy and delicious!   Their Tukee Pear quesadilla has bacon and pears in it. I thought it was an odd combination but it comes with a sauce that ties in the meal altogether.   I tried their Pesto Grilled Cheese and it was subpar. Would skip out on this next time. The shoestring fries are delicious though! Their strawberry mojito was a bit of a disappointment. Not very tasty and wouldn't order it again.   Overall, it's a great lunch spot since it's close to work!",

Nor did any other guests.... but their patio was open. Misters on and very spacious! I can't wait to go back there when it's not so hot and sit outside. They patio area is adorable. But the inside was smaller than expected, and it was pretty crowded. We sat at the bar and had a couple appetizers. I ordered an old fashioned and honestly it was wayyyy to strong, I had to ask the bartender to top it off with more sprite. Also, I just want to say they have amazing French fries. We will be returning for the patio and French fries ",

I got the Buffalo chicken Tacos and they were stacked with lots of chicken. We also got the Jalapeno cheese dip and I got the Strawberry Orange Moscow Mule. Ok I might have had 2 of them at lunch.

Plenty of salad, sandwich, and pasta options.  They have a bar and indoor seating. Outside is a covered patio with shade screens and a mister.  Ambient temperature was reasonable for Arizona in the summer time. Place filled up quickly  for a busy lunch crowd.  I had Paco's Pear Tacos with roasted chicken, bacon, chedder cheese, avocado, sprouts, a sauce and spicy pear pico. The two soft tacos were filling and a very good meld of flavors with a little heat. Order came with side of black beans with some pico. The green iced tea was also very good.  Did not notice any desserts, nor were we asked. Saw a pear cobbler on a Yelp photo  so not quite sure what's up. Noise level inside was a bit high but not a big distraction. Service was excellent...still wondering what happened to that pear cobbler for dessert?",

Most of us ordered various types of tacos.  Service was fairly quick given the crowds of people in the bistro.  I ordered the Pear taco with small bits of pear, chicken, tomatoes, guacamole, sprouts, lettuce and bacon.  A spicy chipotle sauce comes with it along with their homemade black beans.  The tacos stand at attention in their metal holders.  We had to flag down the wait staff for the bill as it was very busy.  They could have used more staff during the lunch hour.  They will do separate bills provided you let them know up front or will combine bills if requested.  Parking available across the street which is good because it is a busy area.",

The salads are huge and filling. The sweet potato fries are great without being too heavy.

I ordered the carnitas tacos and the Greekadilla for the table and they were both a hit. The Greekadilla is a Greek riff on a quesadilla and I couldn't get enough. It came with some sort of cilantro lime sauce and we were almost fighting over the Greekadilla. Do not miss this.  The carnitas tacos were good but nothing special. I would order them again as an appetizer but as my main coarse.  I had the Cuban sandwich as my main coarse and it was very flavorful. It came on marbled rye bread which was a bit out of place but somehow it worked. I could give or take pickles but on this sandwich it makes it all work, leave them on.",

Ive never tried anything else but I must figure figure full portions must be gigantic.   Love the chopped salad. I accidently ordered the cobb one instead once but that was good too.  Recommend chopped salad for sure.  My other 1/2 is usually a pasta.  The green Athena (sp) one is good,  mine was very oily though. Still good. My second time I tried the pesto mac. Im a fan of pesto but I didn't get a distinguishing pesto flavor.  I just tasted mac in a cream sauce.   The sandwiches are okay,  I've only tried one off of bfs plate and it was one of the grilled cheese. Good when dipped in tomato soup ;)  I saw a regular sandwich at another table and they look really hearty. I gotta say the accompanying sweet potato fries were bland,   serrated cut but really thick.   The 1/2 soup is not as a great as a portion.  They also differ depending on days but it's a good choice if you're not wanting to get into a food  coma like I did with the pasta/salad.",

My absolute favorite is the BLTA--their gluten-free bread is soft on the inside but crisp on the outside. It's not dry or grainy (which I find happens a lot with gluten-free breads). They even offer gluten-free noodles for pasta dishes!   They typically serve fries on the side for sandwiches, but I was lucky enough to be informed by our waitress that the fries are cooked in the same oil as their breaded chicken (meaning there was a possibility of cross-contamination). For anyone with celiacs, I would suggest skipping the fries and replacing it with the salad or soup. I got the salad with balsamic, the lettuce was fresh and the sauce added a zesty element (perfect for a hot, summer day).   There is inside and patio seating, I love to sit outside because of their atmosphere. With plenty of misters and plants to keep you cool, you're tucked away in a peaceful grotto. You can tell that all their ingredients are fresh and many of their sauces are housemade. This is the place to go for a healthy and flavorful meal. It's one of my favorite spots if you're gluten-free too!",

My parents had eaten here before and liked it, so it was a good choice on our way to the airport last night (Sky Harbor is about 10 minutes away).   We were greeted by a friendly hostess and initially sat inside, but my dad felt that the AC was a little aggressive, so we moved to the patio. Side note as a Floridian... it IS a dry heat and it is eminently tolerable. You desert dwellers wouldn't last an hour in our swampy steam room down here at the far southern reaches of the US!   My mom and I had a hard time deciding from all of the appealing options. Kudos to them for having a lot of vegetarian choices! My dad went for the Quad City Melt as he'd had it before and liked it. My mom decided on the chicken tacos, side of sweet potato fries, and I had the Mexicali Bowl (quinoa, avocado, roasted butternut squash, cabbage and pepino seeds, served cold). I thought my food was fantastic! Fresh with a hint of spice! We all shared my mom's sweet potato fries, which were excellent. Sometimes s.p. fries can be limp and soggy, but these were perfectly crispy! My folks enjoyed their food very much.   The prices were extremely reasonable given the portion size and food quality, plus the service was friendly and efficient! I had a rather long red-eye flight and I felt totally satisfied while not uncomfortable, so the Perfect Pear was a Perfect Choice for dinner last night!",

I looked at the sandwich and thought to myself \"hmmmm....I have never seen a Cuban with tomato and mayonnaise.\" I shook it off and took two bites then realized this was not what I ordered. Without me having to say anything the server came over with a Cuban in hand and apologizing for the mixup. That I did appreciate. I was not overly impressed with the sandwich and I found the pulled pork to be flavorless and had a lot of fat. I did enjoy the shoestring fries. Parking was atrocious, too. Had to find a spot down in the residential area and hike in a few blocks.",

The strawberries were a bit mealy.  I like the idea of this dish but the execution was lackluster.  When food is premade the taste/quality reflects that.

The peanut coconut curry quinoa bowl with chicken was everything wonderful that you have ever dreamed about presented in a large portion size of healthy deliciousness!  I'm not sure that makes a whole lot of sense, but if there's just one menu item that you're going to order, then make it this quinoa bowl!  The bacon and asparagus grilled cheese was very good, although I felt that this grilled cheese sandwich was lacking a little... cheese.  Would have been even better with a more generous portion of cheese on it!  The coconut curry soup was good, but unfortunately it paled in flavor when also having the peanut coconut curry quinoa bowl.  The addition of peanut really adds so much flavor to the quinoa bowl version that the soup would be better ordered alone.  Our server was on top of her game and quick to answer our questions, take our order, and bring out our food and drinks!  Will definitely return!  *****FIVE STARS*****",

I must've been daydreaming about something else...that something else was none other than the chicken peanut coconut quinoa bowl!!! What a breath full of fresh goodness! Who knew fresh, healthy, good for ur body & soul quinoa bowl could taste like a hot double fudge sundae with blackberry whip cream and jackfruit?!?!   The chicken coconut curry soup and asparagus bacon grilled cheese was just ok compared to the quinoa bowl, hence I'm giving this experience only 4 stars...the soup was overly flavored with turmeric and left a really strong bitter turmeric after taste in ur mouth that's hard to ditch...it was like trying to get rid of an ex that kept coming back...not very pleasant...  The grilled cheese was not really what I was expecting...it could've just been labeled a sandwich since there was not much cheese at all in the so-called grilled cheese, and it was very dry...  The restaurant had a good vibe to it with some cute outdoor seating as well as a cool interior. The hostess that day probably had a rough day, so i will give her a free pass for her inability to smile and her annoyed appearance. Other than that, an overall fun and decent meal with my bae!

They have a nice patio in the cooler months, but there is still a large dining room with ample room for a busy night.  Word on the street was that the portions were really large, so I opted for the 1/2 salad, soup combo.  It was the perfect amount of food for lunch.  I got the tomato basil soup and the Fall Leaves salad.  The salad was full of toppings; goat cheese, bacon, walnuts, beets, quinoa, and squash.  The tomato soup was thin, but had chunks of tomato and had a rich bold flavor to it.  My dining companions loved their meals.  I was really impressed by the quality of the ingredients and the portion size.  This is my new favorite for lunch in Tempe.",

Anyway, I expected a tad more complexity to the flavor from the dressing, but to the plus, it wasn't overwhelming. I think kale negates lots of subtle flavors, so that could have had an affect. Like the ambiance and lighting. The service wasn't overbearing or intrusive, which is nice. Would like to try the asparagus soup, but the salad was huge!",

It is very unique and not like anywhere around the area (I've eaten my way through Tempe it feels like). We are on the covered outdoor patio which was a very cute area with beautiful lights! The server helped us select a beer by giving us samples of the ones we were in between and did not seem at all impatient while we decided. The service was very prompt and pleasant.   The salads are very fresh and mixed/prepared well and they had a great pasta selection too! We did the half soup, half salad which was a great portion size. The pasta was a little bland and I expected more as far as flavor, but this would be the only reason I did not give them the full 5 stars!  I would definitely eat here again and would recommend this to my friends.",

We went on Saturday for dinner, and we got their signature Perfectly Grilled Cheese (brie, four cheese, arugula, bacon) with the house salad side and the Sicilian Sandwich (sirloin, red peppers, tomatoes, arugula) with their seasonal side. When we went, the side was a broccoli slaw, and I just wanted to keep eating the broccoli; it was absolutely delicious.   Their grilled cheese options make the perfect comfort food for any time of day, and they give you a nice portion of food. Same with the Sicilian Sandwich; the sirloin goes down so smoothly, the meal will be over before you know it!",

It is affordable and they offer a great selection of foods... I'm talking anywhere from pasta to tacos. It was a Saturday afternoon, not very busy, and our server was pretty on top of things!  I've been here several times and I don't think the food is the most amazing thing, but it definitely is tasty. The staff, accessibility, ambiance, and reasonable prices keep me coming back. Since I haven't found a menu item that I'm CRAZY about yet, I got a little creative with what I ordered. I asked for the chicken pesto sandwich but in form of a wrap with spinach and other greens bundled inside. VERY tasty. Loved the fact that they were able to make this accommodation for me. I have now found my new favorite thing and will continue comin' back for it!   Give Perfect Pear a try if you're looking for a quick, nice lunch or dinner fix!",

We were pulling pieces of bread out of the bowl once we were done because it was that good! I definitely recommend it.   If you've seen any of my other reviews you know I LOVE chipotle sauce. Perfect Pear has chipotle cream rigatoni and it will change your life, haha. No, but really, it's super delicious. Not too spicy at all! Definitely enough for lunch tomorrow as well. Two meals in one, score!!   The atmosphere is super cute and modern. I don't suggest bringing little ones here, I know mine would have had a hard time there not breaking things lol.

I looked around to see 10 dirty tables outside (and even more inside!!)With only two sets of customers. There was another waitress inside on her phone and another waiter inside fiddling with his beard and mustache. The bistro wasn't busy, and completely filthy. It took 30 min for them to even begin clearing off a table. And throughout our whole dining experience only 1 of 10 was completed, and we were here for over an hour and a half.

Visiting from out of state, staying at a hotel near the airport we were looking for something good, light and reasonable.  The Perfect Pear is for you.  Recommendation to go with the \"Pear Two\".  I had the Acorn Squash Rigatoni, paired with the Pear Cobb Salad.  Absolutely delicious.  Flavorful, excellent portions. We started with spinach dip, again, delicious and flavorful.  Excellent selection of craft beers.  Nike was our server, very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.  Again,  highly recommended you will not be disappointed.",

Good looking menu but maybe a tad too many options. We got the Brussels sprouts salad and the BLT with iced green teas, the salad was good but nothing amazing and the BLT was ok, we weren't fans of the bread of the type of bacon they use. Sweet potato fries are delicious! The iced green tea was so nice and they even give you a cup to go, which was a great touch. Would go again to try more.",

He wolfed it down so quickly that I only got a picture of him and an empty plate!  As there were many other dishes on the menu that I would have liked to try, I'll just have to visit again.",

    "text": "Perfect Pear Bistro...Not so perfect, at least on the day we had lunch.  I was underwhelmed after I had so many people I know rave about the place.  I went with 2 co-workers to celebrate one of their birthdays.  None of us had been before & we were really looking forward to trying it out.  We got there right when they opened...got a nice table with a nice server.  Many unique menu options to choose from...I decided on the Asparagus & Bacon Grilled Cheese with the Tomato/Basil Soup.  I don't like Rye so I asked the waitress for a substitute bread suggestion.  She recommended Ciabatta...done.  Birthday girl ordered tacos & a side of black beans.  Our co-worker finally decided, after much debate, on the Perfectly Grilled Cheese sandwich & soup ( I think it was Asparagus Soup).  The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  Birthday girl grabs her silverware only to find out it's filthy. It's coated in something dark reddish brown & crusty...Strike #1.  My other co-worker is kind of in disbelief when she looked at her Perfectly Grilled Cheese sandwich...It was totally burnt...black.  Knowing the Pear Bread it comes with is covered in sugar it makes sense it would carmalize, but this thing looked like it caught on fire.  Again debating on whether to send it back or not she decided to keep it & had to scrape off as much of the burnt areas as she could because we were on our lunch hour...Strike #2.  My food was a total disappointment...I realized right away Ciabatta was not a good recommendation for my sandwich.  It didn't allow the cheese to properly melt & it was just luke warm.  It was also kind if thick for the sandwich...Strike #3.  The most disappointing had to be the Tomato/Basil Soup.  The flavor just wasn't there & it was covered in what looked to be floating puddles of oil.  I'm no expert but I've had Tomato/Basil soup many times in my lifetime & this greasy looking soup was a first... Strike #4.  I would have given this review 2 stars if it wasn't for the delicious Pear Cobbler.  That was the standout star of the meal & if it hadn't been for the fact we we're celebrating a birthday we would have missed it altogether...My friends both said their food was okay, but its not someplace they feel like they want to go back to anytime soon...My food kind of made this a one & done for me.",

For dinner we chose to all share the Hummus Nachos, the Buffalo Chicken Tacos and the Perfectly Grilled Cheese with French fries and Sweet Potato fries. Starting with the Hummus Nachos- not one bad thing to say about this! It's huge- definitely a sharing size, crisp chips, excellent fresh ingredients and delicious Hummus! The Perfectly Grilled Cheese was absolutely incredible, our favorite out of the 3! The bread we would have bought a loaf of, the cheese combination is the best!! And last but certainly not least the Buffalo Chicken Tacos! So very good! The chicken was flavorful, the slaw on top was fresh and delicious!! Overall it was an excellent experience!!

Overall service was good too.  The only critique I have is that the outside patio area is really blah, awful metal chairs and bright lights, the inside is quite comfortable though. I'll definitely go back for the Pear martinis and flatbread.",
