Everything was great with Ruffino's, right from the start, from making easy reservations on their web page, to the call back confirming our reservation, to seating us right on time.  We started in the bar area for a drink before we sat down, the cocktail server was very nice and got our drinks quickly, you know we needed them after meetings all day. From then on all was great; Our server, John I think, was very nice and made great suggestions, the manager was around a few times to make sure everything went well.   Some of the guys at the table wanted to order a few appetizers, muscles and escargot. Oh dear lord they are going to make me eat snails I thought to myself. And to my great surprise, they were great. I have never had them before, and from my understanding, they are only good if made right, and made right these were. Very yummy, i will have them again for sure.   For dinner I had the Shrimp Carbenara, suggested by John, and it was awesome! Very tasty, huge portion, and a great leftover meal for the next day.   Ruffino's has been around for a long time from my understanding, and I can clearly see why, great service, great food, great time!",

Glad to see this restaurant formerly called Ruffino's is still there and under new management.  You won't be disappointed with the food and service.",

Yeah not ! After being there awhile we finally we had somebody get our drinks. However they never came back around to fill our drinks. Nothing. I was a near a table that a pitcher of ice tea. I filled my own cup several times till the pitcher was empty. We asked a gentlemen if we could get out waiter for service and it was constantly somebody different. We order some app, and bread. However we had to ask 5 times for bread after waiting 30 minutes. So there was dirty plates pilling up and what not. They still haven't  cleared the table. So I get up and I move it myself. In this time I'm observing other table and they are waited on, they eat leave and new customers come. Now while this time, I don't even have a server to order to. I wait. Finally, I walk out. The customer service sucked. I'm glad I didn't spend my money at this place.",

    "text": "Ruffino was the first restaurant my family ate at when we moved to Arizona, which means that simple math would suggest I've been eating here for sixteen years! Seriously. I've eaten here several times a year for sixteen years and have been through either two or three owner changes. I love it. From the mildly cheesy, somewhat 80s styling to the tuxedo'd out waiters, I can't get enough. Ruffinos is a classy restaurant where you're more than some random customer and through my years here, the management has practically bent backwards at times to make things right.  The food here is incredible, and if you're lucky enough to come on a night they have osso bucco, you'll be stuck coming back for the next sixteen years like me. I can vouch for so many of the food items here, but I'll just make a couple of suggestions. For starters the clams casino and escargot can't be beat, they are both rich and garlicky and the escargot is simply not as chewy as most places, so good. For your meal try the tortellini ruffino, one of my favorite meals of all time, or the veal ruffino or filet medallions if they have them. But the osso bucco is a step above most things I've tried in my life. Expensive and worth it.  Look, I don't waste my time on bad restaurants, I eat at good places and me continuing my business here for so long means they're doing something very well, try out Ruffino and see what it is.",

    "text": "Stopped in at Ruffino last Friday around 4pm , thought it would be a great happy hour start for the weekend. Our plan was to order a glass of wine & Oysters Rockefeller, and we did. Teresa, whom I believe is the owner, was working the bar and looked like kitchen help. Her black outfit (uniform) was very unattractive and it looked like she'd been cleaning a house all day long. You would think she would look nice since she's serving the guests. The restrooms were playing wonderful Italian Music, Dean Martin was playing when I was in there, but out in the dining area there was THUMP THUMP music...really? This is an Italian restaurant, where's the ambiance? If I wanted THUMP THUMP/ hip hop, I'd not pick an Italian restaurant. Maybe we should have sat in the bathroom? Oh...but it gets better. A young man, teens, brought in the trash cans from outside, as in 'big round trash bins,' one in each hand, right through the lounge where we were sitting in the booth, one of the trans cans almost rubbed my husband's right arm.  A few minutes later, the young man went out again and brought a 3rd one in, the same way! No lids on the trash cans, just big old dirty trash cans being brought in through the front door - OMG, REALLY? This would break so many regulations - don't ya think? GROSS! How dirty and germy. The wine was just ok, and the Oysters Rockefeller were the worst ever. There were 6, and they were tiny and pathetic looking. They were edible, and we ate them, for $20 - you better believe we ate them, but they are not in any league to even be called Oysters Rockefeller.  My gosh, go to DURANTS and order theirs, THAT'S OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER. Ruffino didn't even have cheese on theirs. The presentation failed drastically. They sat these sad looking 'things' on a wilted bed of iceburg shredded lettuce. You know, the more I think about it, I shouldn't have paid, and I shouldn't have eaten them. We just should have walked out and said \"REALLY?\"  I even left a tip, that's how stupid I am. She didn't deserve a tip, because besides the fact the food was a joke, she didn't come by ONCE, to ask how things were. Didn't even ask if we wanted another drink - nothing. We finally had to flag her down for the check. $33 for what? I felt sick when we left there. Oh well, you never know what you're gonna get, right? We went it happy - looking forward to get our Friday on, and left in different spirits. Felt ripped off and very disappointed. I can tell you that 10 years ago this restaurant was the best in town. It's changed hands long since and is not even comparable anymore.  My amazement is, 1.  How can you allow food to leave your kitchen looking as this dish did? No presentation at all?  2. Do you not know what Oysters Rockefeller are? These didn't look or taste like them. Call them baked oysters, or something, but not Rockefeller, c'mon. Giving 1 star only because you have to chose at least 1. Otherwise, it's a negative number.",

Waiter David was most helpful, with very attentive service.  Wavering between the $35 or the $65 bottle of wine, he suggested their Royalty program which gave us wine for half price (no cost for the Royalty program - just a way for them to get you in their data base.)  Oysters Rockefeller  were very generously sized and beautifully prepared.  House salad (choice of soup or salad)  that comes with the entree had a great balsamic dressing  and was a generous serving as well.  My Veal Picatta was cooked perfectly with a nicely sauteed and beautifully cut green bean and carrot mixture, along with pasta in a light tomato sauce.  The plate was most definitely full - not a lot of blank space.  She chose Linguini with White Clam Sauce as her entree, and was delighted with her selection.  We skipped dessert because we were far too full.  Bottom line, good choice on the wine (with David's help) and very good, traditional Italian fare served in hearty portions by pleasant and friendly staff with above average decor.  I've paid far more and gotten far less in comparable North Phoenix and Scottsdale restaurants...",

    "text": "I am giving this restaurant 1 star, only because my entree was actually good. Otherwise, it would have been a zero star review. Everything there could use a lot of improvement. Upon arriving we were greeted by a hostess who seemed to be confused about where to seat us, although the restaurant was mostly unoccupied, with the exception of the small bar area. This led to her being bickered at by what ended up being our waitress. We were then seated by the manager with no menus. I went to the ladies room to wash my hands before our meal, where I was enjoying the lovely music.... just as it was abrubtly turned off. There was no music for the rest of our visit. When we finally got some menus (and bread upon request), we ordered some drinks. I ordered a rum and coke, and my date ordered a coffee. Don't let their happy hour advertising fool you! There is NO HAPPY HOUR at Ruffino's restaurant. Although they do have a happy hour in the small bar area, if you sit even 10 feet away from it, you do not get to enjoy the special drink prices. I was misled and ended up paying full price for a drink, that if ordered a few feet away would have been half price! My date's coffee came out lukewarm, and when our appetizers arrived I had wished I ordered something else. My dates salad was pretty tasty, but my tortellini en brodo soup was awful. It was some chicken bouillon water with overcooked pasta, that had no hint of the meat it had suggested existed in it. Our entrees arrived quite a while later, and our table still hadn't been bussed since the appetizers. Both of our entrees were pretty darn tasty, but both were only lukewarm again. Not hot at all. Then there was a baby screaming with no music playing to distract me from the wailing infant. The waitress was snippy and seemed to be in a bad mood. And even with a lady following the waitress around for training, couldn't seem to bring out a box for my food and a requested cup of coffee. The service was just slow and almost snotty. So, I really wouldn't recommend it. It is too overpriced for a place with a hit and miss menu and very poor service. Also, I ordered the Chicken Florentine, which is supposedly a stuffed chicken breast. But, it was actually only just topped with the ingredients listed. It also doesn't come with a knife, so I had to attempt cutting it up with a butter knife. Still pretty good, especially after I took it home and made it hot.",

The place was packed. There was also live music playing, which was nice to hear.  One thing I really liked was the salad being created and tossed to your liking at your table.   I really enjoyed the mozzarella that was on the caprese salad.  The chicken parm and pasta I ordered was excellent. I really enjoyed the sauce. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and felt satisfied after.  My wife ordered the rigatoni and also enjoyed the food. I though the meal was a bit dry. A bit more sauce would have been better.   One thing I really noticed was the service. The waiter was great and there was also staff filling your water on a routine basis. The manager also personally came by at the end of the meal to check how things went. A nice touch.  The noise level was a bit high, but there was a large party a short distance from us, which probably contributed to the higher decibel level.  The one downside is the limited parking spots. That's a good thing that the restaurant is busy, but bad if you have trouble finding a spot.  My wife and I will definitely be back on a date night in the future.",

That was most disappointing because we could have gone somewhere closer to home and more reasonably priced for the same quality of food.

    "text": "This restaurant specializes in authentic Italian dishes from the Roman (Lazio) region. A very popular dish is the Carbornara, which is prepared table-side inside a wheel of cheese. The pancetta is plentiful and smoky. It also has more than a little kick to it. Very creamy, cheesy, and generous portions as well. I have one quibble: they say it's parmigiano, it's actually grana padano. You can see it stamped on the side. However a wheel of either is expensive, and grana padano costs about half what parmigiano costs and is an acceptable substitute when cooking. I wouldn't necessarily mark them down for this; I just wish that they would be straightforward about what they are using to make your food. A lot of Italians go here, I am sure most if not all know that parmigiano and grana padano are close but not the same.  I was not so pleased on a separate visit with the amatriciana. It clearly used the same smoked pancetta that was used in the carbonara. This is not how authentic amatriciana is made. It is made with cured pig jowl, which is fattier than pancetta. It's just not the same thing and the dish was about as far from amatriciana as Ahwatukee is from Amatrice, where I have had the real thing many times. These two quibbles indicate a tendency to cut corners that makes me wonder what other corners are being cut.  There are actual Italians working here as well, which is a nice touch!  Our dining companion had the mezzamaniche gorgonzola, it did not disappoint. The happy hour is quite good, reasonably priced and a good variety of items from which to choose.  Despite the two criticisms, I would return here. Just know that if you are familiar with cucina laziale, it may not always live up to your expectations. Buon appetito!",

These guys are tough on restaurants and complained the whole week about the crappy Phoenix cuisine.   Ruffino hit a home run with both of my business colleagues.  Appetizers -   Sauteed Mussels in white garlic sauce.  Spectacular.  Hint - take the garlic bread and dip in in the sauce.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Bruscheta - old skool and tasty, the only complaint is that True Italian Bruscheta does not have Balsamic Vinegar drenched on it.  I loved it, the Euro boys did not.  Antipasto Platter - Lots of tasty stuff on this very large plate of goodies.  Soup - Reviews for Lobster Bisque were stellar.  My take - to much cream, not enough lobster chunks, in fact, none.  Tasted like cream soup.  Just not for me, I would rate in 2 stars or 5 out of 10, mediocre.  Dinner (we shared)  Veal Parmigiana - About an 7 out of 10, kind of no flavor.  Decent but not the best I have had.  Served with grill veggies, which were excellent.  Seafood Ruffino - 10 out of 10.  Just plain to die for.  Lives up to my fellow Yelpers recommendations.  Cannelloni Florentine - Excellent.  10 out of 10.  Served with a cream gravy.   Wine selection is excellent.  What impressed the Euro boys the most is the excellent Limoncello to finish off the meal.   Very happy eating, indeed.",

The squid was freshly cut and it was very crispy ans delicious. I wasn't able to eat dessert because I was very full after eating all of the amazing food. For me this is a must go to place in Arizona for Italian food.",

Food was better, in my opinion, via the use of fresher ingredients and more careful preparation/cooking.  It looks like they are gradually making their own subtle changes to the menu with fresher and/or homemade ingredients.  All the staff was very friendly and one of the new owners, Claudia, went to each and every table to make sure everything was perfect.  We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "My fiance and I dined here on a Friday evening for the first time. We loved it! We had reservations for 5:30pm (earlier than usual due to having an event to attend afterwards) and the restaurant was practically empty at that time, and gave us a quiet, pleasant dining experience. The restaurant did however fill up by the time we left around 7pm, so I would recommend making a reservation. We started with the escargot, which was delicious, although the mushrooms were a bit overpowering and almost masked the flavor of the actual escargot. We also shared a half dozen raw oysters. For entrees I had the seafood stuffed ravioli in lobster bisque sauce which was to die for. I've never had anything quite like it before and I will be coming back for it again. My fiance had the Capellini alla pescatora (seafood in a marinara sauce). While he enjoyed the large portion of seafood, there was entirely too much pasta that came with it. Not necessarily a bad thing if you have a large appetite, just too much for him to finish.  Our server was friendly and polite, although near the end of the meal she did seem to disappear for a period of time after our entrees came out and unfortunately this left us no time for dessert. On our way out, we also noticed a larger crowd in the bar area with a live pianist, a nice added touch for ambiance. We will definitely be back again as there were many menu options we would still like to try as well as a very nice wine list.",

    "text": "The food was amazing!!! Superb service!!!  So we went here for dinner last night. My wife picked this place since she's seen good reviews, and we were mostly  curious on their pasta made on a cheese wheel!  The place was cozy. It's in a strip mall, unassuming, but pleasant. When we got in, somebody was at the door, greeted us, really friendly guy. Only into the meal did we realize he was the owner of the place. The host was polite, had our table ready in a couple of minutes - we did the online reservation, party of 5 with 2 kids. It was quick. It's start of dinnertime, so place was starting to get busy. But it never seemed like it at all thru dinner, since our waiter was always checking on us, water and drinks were always refilled even before it's half empty. Bread was warm and refilled, we said we're good on 3rd refill. We asked the waiter for a good wine pairing with our pasta, he came back with the owner's recommendation and it was excellent.  Onto the main event, we had the calamari, escargot, and the star of the show, the linguine cheese wheel (I forgot the official name). Calamari was light, crunchy, salted and seasoned just right, and it was fresh - no fishy aftertaste at all (not like other restaurants). Escargo was delicious. And for the pasta, the chef (who is actually THE owner too) prepares it right on your table. We never had pasta made on a cheese wheel, and let me tell you, you won't have it any other way (of course not your everyday price point too, but it was worth it)! The sauce had really tasty tasty strips of pork and the pasta is perfect, homemade and just perfect! Big size serving! My son ordered a side o sausage, and he finished it with his pasta.  To cap off, we ordered cappucino, and we also got a limoncello as part of the meal (goes with the meal) - excellent topoff! The chef/owner really makes the place his own with his and staff's charm.   Our dinner was excellent all around! Perfect service! A mom and pop shop that you can go to for a great meal, on a date, or with the family - just excellent experience all around!  Will definitely be back for more! Thanks again guys for the great meal and service!!!",

We shared Calamari and a Shrimp Cocktail to start which were fresh and delicious.For the Main Courses, we chose Lasagna (delicious), Piccata di Pollo (tender & flavorful with nicely cooked vegetables), and the Linguine Alle Vongole (which was a bit salty as other reviewers have noted). Dessert was Cheesecake and Creme Brulee which were a nice, light way to finish off the meal. The wine list featured a good variety of reasonably priced wines.",

When you first walk in there a small bar that looks a little cramped but the dining room is pretty big. Nothing really stood out with the decor.   Anyways, we started off with fried calamari and it was a huge appetizer. The batter on the calamari was very light and cooked just right. I thought it was really good. Also, they gave us little pieces of garlic bread. Outstanding. Really good. Everyone gobbled it up so we had to get another basket.   So each meal comes with soup or salad. I got the salad and I thought it was really big dinner salad it had mixed greens with cucumber, mushrooms, and tomatoes. The salad dressing was great. Not overpowering because at some places the vinegar is a little too much. Not here. Really good.   I had the Seafood Ruffino. It had shrimp, scallops, muscles, and clams over a bed to pasta with a red sauce. I thought it was pretty good. I thought the red sauce could have tasted a little better. It had a good taste but not great. My wife had the chicken primavera. Chicken was moist and she enjoyed it. Hugh dish.   To end our meal was tried the chocolate cake and cheese cake. I thought they were good. Not great. I'm used to these Italian restaurant having great deserts.    The service was top notch. Server took care of us and he was always checking on us during each portion of our meal (appetizer, salad, entree, and desert). Our glasses were filled on a regular basis. The only thing is the server did his job very good but didn't feel like he had personality. Very business like. Seemed like all the servers were like that.   So really good service, good food, and huge portions. Not a bad place. We'll see if we can make it back to this place.",

The prior owner (when it was called Ruffino for many years) served the best garlic bread on the planet.  It was  thin, with a soft middle, crunchy crust and slightly blackened edges.  They use fresh small chunks of garlic and  dipped each slice in butter.   Inexplicably, the new owner did away with it, and instead, serves a very plain white loaf.   This is one of those rare instances where you seek out a restaurant because of one particular dish.  In this case, it was the bread.   No joke....I tipped the busboy last year $10 to keep our basket full of the bread during the entire meal.     Everything else is good, but not exceptional.  We are begging you.....bring back the bread !!",

    "text": "Tried this place a couple of times since the new ownership. Tonight sealed the deal and we won't be back. Not horrible but just not that good.   Orecchiette with broccoli and sausage was promising on the menu but very underwhelming. Don't even ask me about the presentation. Let's just say the sausage needs to be cut or chopped before throwing on the plate.   The gnocchi served in marinara was tasteless  Overall, prices are relatively expensive for the quality of the food and wine.   The good? Complimentary limoncello, friendly service, salmon special, great bread.   Oh well. We'll continue to search for a great Italian place in the Ahwatukee area.",

    "text": "The service at this Trattoria D'Amico is quite good. But we go to restaurants for food, right? Unfortunately beyond the service, it's all downhill.   Ambience is quite subdued, although more aptly put, the atmosphere is like a morgue. Even with the live piano playing, it's still a restaurant in a strip mall that's replaced overhead fluorescents with recessed canned lights.   The only thing worse than the ambience is the food. The Italian food served at Trattoria D'Amico like most Chandler area establishments is amateur Italian. This is the worst of the lot.   Food lacks in flavor(tasteless and signs of a home schooled completely out of his league), presentation(pasta was scooped into a bowl and placed upside down on serving plate, I don't even plate food like that at home not to mention lack of garnishing) freshness and quality of ingredients(lots of pre-prepped food why not just go to the frozen food section of your local super market). Prices were outrageously priced given the quality of food. Any Italian restaurants bread and butter is a bolognese sauce. If you can't get that right, you're in trouble.   All I can say is yuck, why are they still in business, why isn't there a competent chef, why does this place get 4 stars and why do people continue to frequent this place? Food from the airplane is better, and that's sad. These cooks have no business being in the kitchen and these owners have no business being in business. Period.",

    "text": "I had not realized Ruffino's Italian Cuisine was under new management of Trattoria D'Amico until I arrived at the restaurant until I arrived at in the parking lot.  My story is as follows:  Tonight we made reservations for four at Ruffino's Italian Cuisine -- one of my favorite restaurants for years.  It is a classical family run Italian restaurant where you always felt welcomed.  The owner typically greeted at the door and chatted with you on the way out.  If there were ever an issue, it was taken care of immediately, with the owner always involved, and you were very satisfied when you left.  Times have changed...  Now when you pull up to the restaurant the first thing you see is a large white sign covering the business name indicating under new management.  The restaurant is now named \"Trattoria D'Amico, Ruffino Cucina Italiana\". Inside nothing has changed, no remodeling, same bar, same tables, and everything in the original positions.  Had it not been for the sign, you wouldn't know it was under new  management.     The next thing you realize there is no friendly greeter.  No one with that friendly smile who seems more interested in you, than selling you a meal.  My new impression upon entering is that it has the feel of a chain store restaurant with a minimal wage worker just interested in doing their job of getting you seated.    The restaurant was about half-full leaving many empty tables.  We were escorted to a very small table and I asked to be moved to a larger one.  This seemed to be a problem.  Finally they moved us to the same-size table in a slightly larger space so we didn't feel so cramped.  I noted through the entire dinner that the larger tables were never used and that the dining room never filled.  After waiting an unusually long time, someone dropped of a basket of bread, saying she noted we had been waiting a while -- someone would be with us soon.  We were told Izzy would be waiting on us (whom never seemed to have showed up).  After another extended wait a different waiter came to the table and said he would be our server (I don't know what happen to Izzy).    The hostess had only given us 2 menus (we had to ask for more).   We ordered some wine and asked for some more bread (I hadn't had any the first round).  Again, another long wait for the wine to be served by a third person.  Still waiting even longer, the waiter finally returned to take our orders.    The two ladies had the special for the evening (salmon) while my friend chose the chicken and I asked for Rigatoni Parm with Marinara.  I reminded the waiter for a second time that we needed more bread.      After the usual wait, the meal was delivered.  The ladies served first, then my friend.  I was given the wrong meal.  The waiter said he would have it corrected and I reminded him one more time we needed more bread.     I sat there and waited, waited, and waited....   No bread delivered, no one check on us for more drinks, as I watched everyone at the table finish their meals.  I saw the waiter a few times, but he never gazed over at our table.  Finally, when diner was complete, I caught his attention and he came over.  I asked him to cancel my order.  He responded \"I think it is ready\" and headed to the kitchen.  He immediately returned with it, and I reminded him that we needed more bread.  Another person brought that over.    My friends at the table were very gracious, encouraging me now to rush dinner, as they sensed the awkwardness.  I took my first bite an the meal was barely warm.  It had obviously sat ready for a while.  After all this, not even a manager visited our table to check on us -- and we were billed the full amount.    At no point was was their an apology for the bad service or the mistake.  I did hear a comment on how the restaurant was being slammed as I looked at the empty tables around me.  For the price of the meal, this is not the ambiance more service level I would expect.  It felt more like a Denny's...      In the past, the kindly owner always stood by the door checking in on how the meal was, and offering some small chit-chat.  The only thing at the door was a small dish of mints.  Unfortunately Rufino's has gone from my favorite restaurant to one that I will not visit again.",

If you would like to compete with chain restaurants that are consistent with their food, at least have the quality of food to stand by the prices you are charging customers. For 2 customers to have 2 bud lights, an appetizer, lasagna and chicken marsala should not cost $70.00. Not worth it, at all. Food was sub par at best. Waitress was nice and attentive, not her fault the food is over priced and normal at best. Hard earned money down the drain. Never going back.",

However I won't be going back any more.  I made reservations several days in advance for my daughters 18th Birthday and from the moment we arrived the service was horrible. Waited at the doorway for several minutes before being greeted and then a waiter took us to our table. No warm greeting for us! The table was horrific ...in the absolute worse location in a busy isle right by  kitchen doorway. When I asked if we could be seated somewhere else & that I had made reservations several days ago, the waiter was quite rude and stated that they were very busy and everyone else had made reservations as well. He finally offered another location but stated it would be just as bad.  We just sat where we were.   (Btw, half the restaurant was empty) Several times staff ran into the back of my chair and not once did they say excuse me.   The service was fair....we had empty water glasses most of the dinner. Waited for a very long time for our food and one meal had been forgotten.  The food was ok-not fabulous. Maybe it was the entire experience.   I made a big deal from the beginning of making reservations that it was my daughters 18th birthday-not until we were leaving did the waitress even say Happy Birthday.   We have spent a lot of money here and always enjoyed coming....no more. Such a shame...",

I also wanted to mention the bolognese sauce as it was delicious! Best I have had since That Italian Place closed. Everyone at the table enjoyed their entrees. Also wanted to mention the live music.

Bar accessories in the way of my wine glass and water (straws, napkins) - can I have some personal space please (lol).  Food arrived well before napkin and placemat. I like to think that I won't drop bread on my lap, but I am drinking a glass of wine!  Garlic bread was flat (like sitting under a heater for a while, devoid of freshness). Salad was basic greens with a lot of olive oil and not much else. Pasta with homemade sausage was fair- not a lot of flavor (recommended by bartender). Brocolli was well prepared.  Service at the bar was 2/5 stars. Bartender was overworked with volume, he had to ask for help. Still would of appreciated a \"how was that meal\" question.  Overall average. Heard there were new owners so wanted to try. I like the idea of independent owners. Lots of Italian places in Ahwatukee, so competition is high. Might try again after new owners have more changes in menu.",

We were surrounded by couples celebrating an evening of Love and the music from the bar worked nicely to set the mood. Service was inattentive, and I felt that not being a regular actually hurt our chances of having a decent meal. Our waiter knew just about everyone else around us and extra helpings of bread and the like went out to them. The food was meh. Decent Italian, but I think I could do the same plates justice at home. Again, I realize it was a special night with a special menu, but warmed over pasta just wasn't that special. I've heard good things about Ruffino's over the years but probably won't dare a second visit.",

The menu has been updated since the new owners from Rome came over, and it is definitely an upgrade from the prior.  the house special that night of spaghetti carbonara made in a giant cheese wheel was unbelievable, as was the gnocchi and penne amitriciana the others at our table ordered.  Excellent service as well.  Will most definitely be back",

    "text": "This restaurant is a typical (and I mean typical in every sense of the word) American Italian restaurant.  Let's see:  - Cheesy Italian music subtly playing in background - Check - Wood Paneling and faux crystal light fixtures, reminding you eerily of the 80's - Check - Pleasant but not overbearing waiters/waitresses in black-n-whites - Check - Salad and Garlic Bread with everything - Check  Now, as to the food we ordered, the Bruschetta was nicely toasted, with a garlicy tomatoe mix on top - very nice.  Then came the salad, which is tossed table side - a nice touch.  However, the greens tasted like they were straight out of a bag.  No-one takes a free salad seriously any more.  This was followed with warm garlic bread - the french baguette they were using for this had been squashed and went cold very quickly.  Cold garlic bread that doesn't taste of garlic sounds like cold toast to me.  On to the main courses.  My companion and I both had \"signature dishes\" - I had the Duck Ravioli, which was accompanied by a tomato cream sauce, and she had the Shrimp linguine, which was also pleasant.  All-in-all, this was a pleasant evening.  The food was reasonable, and the environment non-obtrusive.  The \"free\" accompaniments brought the meal down a notch - get rid of the garlic bread and salad unless asked for (and when they are asked for - make them shine - it's not that hard), and you have a five-star place.",

Most places don't charge for club soda but they do. I asked for a ceasar salad and there was a $6.00 up charge. The salad was good and quite large but I'd rather have a smaller one with zero charge. I had Lasagna and it was decent but it had lots of cheese. I grew up on grandma's lasagna so I expect it to be good. The wife had some sausage thing and the daughter had gnocchi. I've been to many Italian places in the east valley and I'd stick with Vincitorio's or Arrivederci's. This place is just too pricey. If you want a great deal, with low prices go to Florindino's in Chandler. For price and quality it's a no brainer.",

I've tried two different entrees so far;  linguine with clam sauce was my first order and capellini toscana the second.  Both were delicious. The linguine was al dente and topped with fresh clams. Sauce tasted home made with just the right balance of seafood taste and creaminess. The capellini wasn't as al dente as the linguine but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Spicy Italian sausage provided a counterpoint to the savory sun dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts.   All in all my delivery experience has been positive and I'll be ordering again soon.",

My partner loves their lasagna and has ordered it at each visit.  While the portion sizes look small, they're actually adequate considering you're given bread and then choice of soup or salad.  I was full from the 4 ravioli you get.  While prices seem high, it is including soup or salad, and the homemade quality is worth it compared to other typical Italian restaurants.  I've been to Italy, so I know what real homemade pasta is supposed to taste like.  We have had good service, but the decor seems a little dark and dated.",

I wanted chicken parmigiana, but the person taking the order told me\"it's not on the menu anymore\". I explained that they have always made it for me, and he replied very tensely, \" I told you we're not making it anymore because it's not made in the kitchen\".

So spicy that I figured the red chili flakes were shoveled onto plate. Inedible. Hope these owners are not same ones immediately after Ruffino ones.  Some day may work the courage up to try again. Yes it has been several years but the worst plate in history is unforgettable. Seriously hope new owners have recaptured the old glory of ruffinos.",

What impressed me the most, is the owners are straight from Italy & are very hands on with the restaurant. They had a really good Montepulciano by the glass. My friends & I loved everything about this place! We had every appetizer on the menu + entrees. What stood out for us, was the table side fettuccine in the Parmesan wheel. AMAZING & DELICIOUS! The canolli was the final dessert, SO GOOD!! Romolo the owner was so gracious & handsome if I do say so myself.",

Our server last night was Israel, he was engaging, on top of service without being obtrusive, and even arranged for an off menu Veal Francese for Scott. He understood that we were celebrating my Dad's birthday posthumously and was respectful.  The dining room(s) and bar area are spacious, with votives on the table. Saturday night there was a nice jazz trio playing in the bar, and the restaurant was packed. The bartender served a perfect dry Titos Martini, up with blue cheese stuffed olives.   Started with the warm, delicious bread and good quality olive oil; the caprese salad is simple and flavorful, the sweet balsamic is thick and obviously aged. Dinner comes with salad or pasta fagioli, the latter is an admirable version. Scott is a fan of the tortellini en brodo, and enjoyed his cup. They weren't doing the house signature Pasta Carbonara in Parmesan wheel, but when they do, it is perfection. My penne con vongole was garlicky heaven, and I took some to-go. Mom thoroughly enjoyed their shrimp Scampi, and took a large portion of the accompanying angel hair pasta to-go.   We shared the tiramisu, which was light, espresso laden, the lady fingers were not at all soggy. Scott had a piece of New York style cheesecake he raved about, and I appreciated the House Limoncello appertif offered.   They have good Happy Hour selections in the bar, and this remains a favorite neighborhood restaurant offering delicious food. We are fans!  * Highly suggest reservations *",

They had pretty solid reviews so why not. The staff was nice. However, it seemed like a very \"local\" place and they were somewhat annoyed we were there. My wife is Italian so we thought some authentic Italian food would be nice. Unfortunately the food was subpar and reminded us a more of back home Pennsylvania rather then Italy. Seems like a nice place that was good once but time has taken it's toll.",

Pasta fazool came with a meal, when I offered to pay extra to upgrade to the lobster bisque I was told no I would have to order a whole separate soup at full price. Seriously?  We were pretty sure that the food was not fresh cooked since the lasagna came out warm on the outside but when cut through the middle the cheese was cold on the inside. So probably just heated up with a microwave. when we mentioned it to the waiter and asked if it could be heated up some more, he went on to help two other tables before taking the dish back to the kitchen. Also, there were several other veal dishes on the menu but when we asked if the chef could make veal parmesan we were told no not tonight they were too busy. The restaurant was probably not even halfway full so this also leads us to believe that the food is not fresh cooked. I will say that the lasagna was very tasty when it finally came out warm but with all the other issues I don't think we'll be going back.",

I agree with a previous reviewer that the prices are a little steep, so it's not the place to go every week.

Depending on who waits on you, you will be charged for drinks you didn't order and the prices will be inconsistent on the check for what you actually order.  3 different prices for the same brand of beer.  I believe this is padding to compensate for the fledgling revenues and dwindling crowd.  Sit at the bar as the service is better.  Careful when you bring up the inconsistencies on the tab as the owner is defensive and condescending.  They should practice consistency.  Long time regulars complain about the shell of this establishment from whatnot was, but come here for convenience.  If you really have a choice, go to Garage across the street.

A couple of my guests had been to Ruffino before and were chomping at the bit to go back, because our experiences had been so good.  We were greeted at the door and assured that we would have 2 waitstaff to serve us.  The food was generally pretty good,  but could have been warmer.  The service was another story. Initial drink service was slow. Food service for the appetizers was agonizingly slower.  At one point, because the salad had been sitting on a tray near our table waiting to be served for 6-8 minutes, one of my guests got up and started to serve the salad herself.  The manager came over and started to help her, then the waiter came over to serve the last salad.  My salad had lettuce with lots of brown spots.  We had to ask for drink refills and for bread.  The food was warm, but not hot. We saw one waitress early on, and then the rest of the evening was taken care of by an easily distracted waiter.    This was beginning to be my \"go to\" place for taking business guests.  Guess I'll be going back to Va Bene.",

I was telling my date about the Osso Bucco being my choice if I ever had to pick a last meal, when the server took the hint and brought us a small plate of pasta with the sauce.  You're not going to get that at O-G.  So when you want a great meal at a local hole in the wall, I highly recommend Ruffino's.  On Friday's, weekends and holiday's you should call ahead for a reservation.  Keep the kids at home so you can really enjoy the experience.",

We had a party of 10 and the service was terrible.  The servers didn't bring drinks or ask if we wanted anything other than our order. They were all in a back room doing something. And the food was not good, either. I had chicken piccata - yuck. It had a thickish cream sauce - like creamy soup. Not light and lemony like it should be. I do not think I would go back.",

    "text": "Don't know what has happened to this restaurant but was very disappointing. First of all, even though our table was close to the door in the bar area, the host did not even accompany us, but motioned where to sit. Upon ordering our drinks, we were very surprised being told there would be an extra charge for stuffed olives in my husband's martini. My husband has ordered martinis with stuffed olives at the most finest, and least popular restaurants, and never has he been told an additional cost would be charged for his request. Consequently, after waiting an unusually long time for our before dinner drinks, they were brought to our table along with my husband's soup. In the past we had often frequented Ruffino's, however with the present ownership we are likely not to return. Food was just o.k., nothing exceptional. I think Ruffino's had lost its personal flavor as the previous owners would drop by the table, ask if service and food were enjoyable and to our liking, chatted a little, and made you feel like special guests. It has been a long while that we have dined at Ruffino's, and our experience was mediocre at best.",

    "text": "When first walking into this restaurant, I was wowed. It's not your typical Phoenix restaurant. There was white table cloth. The waiters were all formally dressed.  It had a live jazz singer.  I was a little taken aback because it has the ambience of a fine steak restaurant like a Donovans as opposed to a nice Italian restaurant.  It was a nice change of scenery from your usual west coast trendy yet casual Phoenix restaurant ambience.   The service was also excellent.  Our waiter was hyper animated which was a little annoying yet appreciated because he was attentive.  Overall the service was nearly perfect. All the waiters had manners and were old school in their mannerism. Again, this was a welcome change from the trendy young stud or hot girl who act like they are too cool to be serving tables.   In regards to the food....DISAPPOINTING.  I was really shocked. I really wanted to like this place but the food had no flavor.  There is nothing about the food that would make one want to go back.  The eggplant parmegan was sloppy and watery egglant that tasted like boiled egglant.  The tortalleni ruffino was served in an alfredo sauce that tasted like potato soup poured onto pasta. It was so thick and tasteless. The tortelini had no flavor and it's filling was bland.   The restaurant does some things to provide one with a homely feel. They serve garlic bread toasts as free appetizers and constantly refresh it. The jazz music in the background was also a nice touch.  Stil the atmosphere was a bit claustrophobic for me.",

We have been going to Ruffino's for over 20 years, off and on, and still like it.  I am writing this review just to give readers some recent feedback.  Ruffino has a limited menu, but pretty decent food and prices.  Nothing outstanding, but decent and worth your time if you want to try their offerings.  My wife ordered their clam linuini, lunch portion, and it was good and substantial.  My daughter ordered the lunch manicotti and that too was decent and substantial.  Lunch does not come with anything -- no veggie, no salad -- just the entree and bread.  I ordered the dinner order of veal masala and it was good and came with veggies, side pasta, and side salad.  The price was fair.  We ordered and shared an antipasti platter to share first, and it came with two kinds of cheese, two kinds of olives, artichoke hearts, ham, procuitto, salami, mortadella, sweet and hot peppers, and about four big leaves of romaine.  Pretty substantial.  So I just wanted to report that it was pretty good and we will go back, but next time on a Thurs, since Thurs is Osso Bucco day.",

Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and always made sure we were taken care of. I have read some reviews about the food taking too long but to be honest, it didn't take any longer than usual. Of course it depends on what you order but in my opinion the chef can take as long as he wants because the food speaks for itself. Make sure you ask about their monthly special. I was lucky enough to have the raviolis and they were delicious.   Don't sleep on this Italian hidden gem!",

Speak about the specials of the night Talk up an appetizer or offer a tasty salad with your meal. Return to ask if you prefer an additional cocktail or refill a tea glass.

    "text": "This place holds a lot of nostalgia for me. As Ruffino's  that is. Around 1993, 18 years married, one year divorced, it was the first \"Fancy\" restaurant I waltzed in alone on a Saturday to have a dinner for one at.  Kevin was the owner, and from that day forward I never felt \"funny\" fine dining alone.  Since it changed names I have never been.  14 years and two more divorces, I was Jonesing for Italian last night. I Yelped this place that I should have realized was... my old Ruffino!  Well it was meant to be I thought.  Ambiance a little more casual, but they had the same chairs!  The menu is not as extensive as Ruffinos was I noticed. That's ok-I stick with 4-5 regular favorites anyway.  Waiters/waitresses not quite as attentive as before,but I was a real regular- so???  Let's start: Bread? Big long roll, not warm and a little tough, not cut all the way thru-it didn't tear because it was tough on bottom. There was a strip of the bottom left attached at both attempts to get a slice.  Has worse- certainly had better. Moving on.  I ordered the regular salad. I wasn't asked about a choice of dressing but noticed after ordering the other waiter was asking everyone which dressing.  She brought me the Italian- which is probably what I would have ordered anyway-but I do love blue cheese too.  Appetizer: the BEST thing all night. Fried calamari. Light, crisp, tender. SPOT on!  There was a wine special- I ordered the red and it was good value and pretty darn tasty.  Since I read a review about the Orecchiette, and I LOVE mushrooms and broccoli, I ordered it.  The timing  of serving the dishes was  perfect btw .  When served it, all I could see was lots and lots of grey, crumbly sausage-like ground meat.  I was looking hard for any  mushrooms or broccoli, and almost called her over thinking there was an error. Then I saw them:pieces of broccoli so small all together they could not be one floret. There was one a little larger than most-and it was yummy.  Hmmm Then I went in search of any mushrooms: the pieces were so so tiny it was hard to tell they were a mushroom by tasting them, and there were maybe 6-7 of these. Not even half a mushroom WTF?  Well, I had a movie to go to, so I just dug in.  Pasta was cooked perfectly, the whole dish was just a bit too salty for me-but certainly edible.   It's one of those dishes with no real sauce, but the flavors make the juice good- so ok.  The sausage was just not what I expected-the flavor grew on me enough to eat close to half of it- but the dish was overwhelmed with the portion of grey crumbly sausage-which didn't taste like any Italian sausage I've ever had   After taking half of the sausage off to the side, I went in search of any sliver of broccoli or mushroom and made those my bites.  It was fairly good -not great or delicious. I would NEVER order it again.  I saw those awesome cheese wheels on fire: fettuccine, but after reading one reviewer saying it was too salty, I was glad I didn't get it.  Service was good-not bad not exceptional No complaints  Just under $70. With tip- it was disappointing for the price.  I think I may go back once more - give it one more shot.  I'd love to love this place- if just for old times sake. We'll see...",

    "text": "Met a friend for happy hour.  Didn't enjoy the $5 Mark West Pinot Noir, but really liked the housemade limoncello!  Romolo, a co-owner of Trattoria D'Amico, had me sample it, and after a couple of sips, I knew I'd order one for me and guessed correctly that my friend would want one, too.  Alessio, Romolo's brother-in-law, was friendly and patient as I asked a few questions regarding the bread and pastas- are they made in-house?  The bread is from a local bakery, and some of the pastas are homemade- gnocchi, ravioli, cannelloni, and lasagna.  I already placed an order of Bocconcini di filetto prior to friend's arrival, and this was delivered shortly before friend arrived.  I almost returned it after seeing how charred the pieces were, but the description did mention it being \"blackened Cajun-style.\"  Now, I've seen two different presentations of \"blackened-\" one is burnt/charred, and the other is seasoned with so many spices that the entree takes on a darkened appearance.  Since Alessio had been so nice and open to all of my questions, I decided I'd give the charred pieces a try, and are we glad I did!  \"First bite is the best,\" an adage that certainly applied to the first piece I tried, but also the last piece.  The two pieces in between were a bit sinewy and less flavorful.  However, I wouldn't mind ordering this again.    It was hard to leave TD for an appointment nearby, due to Alessio's and Romolo's attentiveness and the friendly demeanor of other guests- most seemed to be regulars- but we had to leave, but not before agreeing to come back for dinner!  Appointment over, we found ourselves back at TD and sat at one of the dining rooms.  If you can, do try to get seated at the back, behind the wall of wine bottles.  Atmosphere is quieter here and very intimate.  I knew I wanted to try the Linguine Carbonara (pancetta, garlic, olive oil) from looking at the photos posted on TD's Yelp page.  I also thought the Ravioli D'anatra (stuffed with braised duck and ricotta, with sun-dried tomatoes, and tomato-cognac butter sauce) sounded exquisite, but Alessio preferred the Orecchiette Alla Boscaiola (Italian sausage, broccoli, minus mushrooms, white wine sauce), which also sounded divine.  I chose the linguine and friend ordered the ravioli, which made me happy because I wanted to try a housemade pasta dish!    Entrees come with your choice of a side salad, or a cup of pasta e fagioli.  Oh, how I miss ordering this type of soup!  I've enjoyed them immensely before I'd developed allergies to carrot and celery, so soups are pretty much off-limits to me now, but I didn't have to wallow in self-pity very long, because the salad was full of fresh greens, amazingly plump and sweet tomato slices (bomb!), with a terrific Italian vinaigrette.  Darn!  I meant to ask if I could purchase a bottle of it to take home... One more reason to return.  The linguine carbonara was the first to arrive, cooked table-side in a cheese wheel put to flame!  Romolo himself did the cooking, and it was a sight to behold.  I'd asked how many times is a cheese wheel used, and he said that he'd opened this particular wheel two weeks ago, and wheels can be used one to two months until it splits apart.  What a disappointment then to discover this gorgeous dish- you can imagine our mouths salivating as we watched it being prepared- was too salty!  I knew it was too salty for me to enjoy at first bite, but I thought I'd give it another try after tasting the ravioli.  Oh, the ravioli was perfectly salted, the pasta was impeccably al dente and homemade (!), and the tomato-cognac butter sauce was delightful!  When I went back to the linguine, it was even saltier than the first try, so I gave up.  Friend tried a second forkful and agreed it was very salty, but that it's most likely from it being cooked in the cheese wheel.  I was going to try my fourth small forkful when server Luigi came by and asked how everything was.  \"The entree was so salty,\" I just had to say something, and after expressing surprise, Luigi quickly offered to take the dish away and give me a chance to choose another entree, and the orecchiette it was.  Luigi (Luis is his real name) showed his great sense of humor by confirming my special request of \"no mushrooms\" with \"OK, extra mushrooms!  I repeated with a \"no, no mushrooms,\" to which he laughed and said he understood, because he didn't like mushrooms himself.  Oh, but I do love them, just can't have them anymore.  He would later return to say the chef would like to know if I wanted shiitake or button mushrooms...  Too funny.  Very pretty entree- plump ear-shaped pasta, nice chunks of crushed Italian sausage, with a whole one just in case you needed more of the spicy meat, and luscious, verdant broccoli.    We were too full to try the housemade tiramisu and cannoli, so that will be another reason to return, and soon!  I could easily see myself taking friends and family here for holiday meals and happy hour get-togethers.",

    "text": "Spreading some Ahwatukee love... this mom and pop Italian restaurant impressed me! Came here over the weekend for a birthday dinner. Walked into a clean, classic and classy place with most of its tables filled with families and couples on dates alike. There were 9 of us and our table was ready right on time for our reservation. Our lovely server got our drink orders right away as we waited for our whole party to arrive before ordering dinner. There was no lag when we all arrived- she again took our orders, then we munched on their homemade warm bread with olive + balsamic oils. We did understandably wait a little long for our entrees so they could bring them all out around the same time, but they get a pass for that. I split the Gnocchi with my friend and oh my goodness-- It was the most pillowy, melt in your mouth potato balls I have ever had. The tomato sauce itself was also savory and delicious and fresh basil was icing on the cake. Just half of the order was enough and I appreciate that they don't upcharge for splitting. Surprisingly, they gave both of us a side salad (choice of soup or salad with entree) instead of giving us only one to share. We ordered a few desserts (tiramisu, cannoli, and chocolate cake- ALL GOOD) and they made sure to have a candle + sing for the birthday girl. In the end, they gladly split our check just as we ordered which also I appreciate so much as opposed to those restaurants with policies against it. As we were walking out, we didn't realize LIVE MUSIC was playing the whole time we were there. Such a lovely touch to the evening. Living in Ahwatukee, I literally drove past this little restaurant every day, but never thought to go there. I am so glad my friends picked this place because we will have to come back again! 5 solid stars in my book!",

(You may not have room for dessert.)  I loved Fettucine D'Amico made with a mixed sauce of tomato, brown and cream sauce and sliced homemade Italian sausage. It's different in a sublime and tastebud tantalizing way.  Fresh blackened cod was fresh, perfectly spiced and cooked so it was moist and flaky.

    "text": "First visit to ruffinos. Nice atmosphere friendly staff. Food I had the veal parmigian dinner  pasta Fajoul soup and fried breaded cheese sticks and calamari for appetizers. . Mozzarella cheese sticks average to good . Calamari average at best. Soup average at best. Veal parmigiana on the chewy tough side with a bland but fresh American style flavor. Pasta bland sauce also. Vegetables first time accompanied that dish not tasty. Add it up for myself waste of money $136 dollars $25 tip for 3 dinners.waitress had the nerve to charge to refill one glass of coke filled with ice. Wife ordered the worst eggplant she ever tasted. Under cooked raw inside. When I took one bite water came out like a water Mellon. yech. Sauce was also  bland and not enough cheese she commented. Our guest from panama had shrimp scampi for her birthday which they didn't recognize her birthday nor give 2 cents about her. She left over the medium to small shrimp, need I say moe. All totaled a total waste of money $136.00 plus $25 tip. If you are looking for authentic italian go eat at AVANTI or ROMA GARDENS FOR NY OR BROOKLYN OLD WORLD STYLE COOKING. They are the best of the best , costs a little more but you get perfectly delicious veal and eggplant and appetizers. I'd rather pay more for perfect than save a little money for average. Ruffino totally disappointed after looking foward to eating there because of reviews. Bland American style is how I sum up the food. Wasn't the worst, far far away fromthe best unfortunate. NOT AN ENJOYABLE DINNER 2 1/2 STARS.  Generic ITALIAN  COOKED FOR THE MASSES WITHOT FLAVOR.",

    "text": "2.5 stars, maybe.  I hate to bag on a restaurant because I know restaurant owners work so hard, but this was a pretty bad experience.  I know they have live music, too, and that is a sign of class.  Fundamentally, the problem with this place can best be summed up by saying that it wouldn't surprise me if there isn't a single Italian involved in the running of this place.  If there is, they have gone so American it's hard to tell.  Think Pascal in \"Big NIght.\"  When I showed up by myself at 7pm, I had not eaten lunch so I should have been pretty easy to please.  The restaurant was mostly empty, yet I was sat  at a small table right next to the only baby in the restaurant.  Really?  I probably didn't look Awhatukee chic, but I didn't look like a bum either.  And hey, it was Monday and my credit card is paid off.  I was sat by the owner (I think).  He didn't take a drink order and then I waited a long time to get a menu or a drink.  I don't blame the server.  It was bad timing as she knew she had a meal for four being plated and a couple of credit cards to run.  The owner could have easily handled both the menu and my drink order.  Then, they brought the garlic bread.  It was that soggy over-buttered, undercooked, nastiness you would never get in Italy or even a high-end Italian restaurant in the states.  (Think Fazoli's)  The greasiness probably started to take away my appetite which had been sky high when I arrived.  I would strongly recommend that Ruffino's ditch the garlic bread and go with nice Italian bread and small bowl of butter.  Soon after, the entrees for the neighboring table arrived.  They didn't look like $25-30 entrees.  Even the osso bucco looked unappetizing..  Then, they brought me a cup of brodo with tortellini.  The waitress warned me to be careful because it was super hot.  I would say it was just hot enough not to get sent back.  It was decent, but kind of puny for four bucks.  The bowl would have been seven and I was mostly trying it out of curiosity.  The broth was pretty good, but as it got colder it lost any magic it had.  I also got a Campari and soda, which was a little light on Campari.  It didn't come with a fruit wedge of any type, which is pretty standard when an Italian is behind the bar.  So, I asked for an orange.  Unfortunately, because I was seated in the farthest corner from the door and the bar, I didn't get the orange until I was over halfway through the Campari and soda.  Maybe I'm off base here and I should asked for it explicitly.  Sorry, I'm not much of a drinker.  The salad was quite good.  They make it tableside which is nice because I got to pick my choice of elements.  The greens were excellent and the dressing was nice.  I think I got two portions even though I was by myself, which was great.  Unfortunately, there was a little too much cheese (or something) making it too heavy.  Still, not bad.  Throughout the evening my water glass was empty, which is annoying when you're paying $20 minimum for an entree.  I'm not a stickler about this stuff, but when it happens 3-5 times at a place like this, it's not right.  My waitress was very nice and worked very hard.  One thing that sort of stuck with me was when I was discussing the menu, she said something like, \"They've been here 20 years, it's good.\"  I'm wondering if that was indicative of a place resting too much on its laurels.  I got the Fettuccini Ruffino which was a sausage-based dish listed as one of seven signature dishes on the menu and strongly recommended by my server because it was \"simple\" and tasty.  After a pretty dubious performance so far, I convinced myself that this entree was going to hit it out of the park and save the evening.  Instead, it was a total failure and I was actually forcing it down by the end.  It wasn't simple.  It was sloppy.  They cooked the life out of the fettuccini and the sauce looked like something Olive Garden would have invented, not like the sausage crumbles with oil, pasta and vegetables I am used to at high-end Italian joints.  The sausage was exactly like something you'd buy at Trader Joe's, which isn't bad, but it didn't seem homemade or special.  Honestly, if they had put the plate in front of me, my first reaction would have been to tell them they had brought it to the wrong table.   Maybe I was expecting the wrong the thing, but whatever the case, it didn't taste very good.  Afterward, I went to Enzo's Cafe and Gelato for a cappuccino to make things right.  There was more Italian in that cappuccino than a whole meal at Ruffino's.  Now, I'm watching Tony Bourdain in Naples just to make up for the rest of the evening..  I hope I can get another chance to go here and have them prove me wrong, but I won't do it on my dime.  There was just a little too much Olive Garden in Ruffino's to justify the prices.",

    "text": "Ruffino is definitely the kind of italian restaurant that your grandparents go to when they want to try somewhere nice. The decor is definitely mid-1980s but is well-kept.   I ate here for a work function, so I ordered from a limited menu. The only vegetarian option was a fettuccine alfredo, so I asked them if they could give me fettuccine with a marinara sauce. They gladly obliged  The marinara sauce was surprisingly good. Lots of chunky tomato bits and very good garlic flavor.  The fettuccine noodles were delicious....perfect thickness and just enough taste to make them compliment the sauce.  Service is friendly but forgetful; drinks were ordered by several people at the table at different times and were forgotten by the waiter.  Would I go here again? Honestly, with so many good italian options available, I wouldn't drive down to Ahwatukee to eat here, but if someone invites you out here, you will get a decent meal.",

    "text": "Amateur Hour: How Dinner Could Have Gone Terribly Wrong But Somehow Ended Up Being Rock Solid  The setting: New Year's Eve, six o'clock, South Tempe and Ahwatukee The players: The ravenous Mr. Man and Me, a Black Mitsubishi Montero on a mission  Granted, going out for dinner on New Year's Eve is by and large a mistake. Holidays are the times when it's most likely the stresses placed on the kitchen and wait staff may result in frazzled service and a less than savory dining experience. But ramen for dinner was out of the question. (I've tried to keep that survival food to a minimum since graduating.) So what's a gal to do?   Hop into the hooptyville and cruise in search of something better than soggy shoestrings. Doesn't sound like much of a challenge at first until our two players realize that it's New Year's Even and they're pretty fucked for A) Places that still have seats open cuz all the smart folks made reservations, B) Places that are open at all cuz nobody wants to work when there's bubbly to be had and C) Places other than 24 hour greasy spoons cuz even fast food joints close on New Year's Eve.  45 minutes elapse in which our players dart in and out of establishments encountering option A, drive by potential restaurants while encountering option B, and almost succumb to option C. Enter Ruffino's, a humble little Italian Restaurant located in a strip mall dangerously close to the suburbs of Ahwatukee.   So we saunter up and politely wait our turn for the hostess to be free. \"Two. No, we didn't make reservations.\" And the flibbertigibbet proceeds to seat two parties milling around us without even informing us whether dining there was a possibility. Again, she turns to us. \"Do you have an open table for two? No, we didn't make reservations.\" Again, she proceeds to seat others. Lots and lots of others.  Oh no you did not just rouse the bitch from her slumber. The pursed lips, raised eyebrow and death stare begin to surface. Mr. Man senses the subtle change, \"Do you just want to go and find somewhere else to eat?\"  A cold, calculating response with an edge sharp enough to cut the horrid poodle hair off the twit that's been snubbing us spews out. (I can't recall what it was exactly. The vitriol clouds memory, often with good reason.)  Then our savior, a tux dressed waiter out of stage left, greets us with a smile and ushers us to a table for two in the bar area. The bitch circles three times before settling down for a snooze so Erica can enjoy a nice meal with Mr. Man.  Since it was a busy holiday they only had three seating times and a truncated menu, but that just makes it easier for an indecisive gal like me to make up my mind. Mr. Man goes with his favorite, the Veal Marsala. I opt for the Veal Ruffino, prosciutto and mushrooms sauteed in a tarragon brandy cream sauce layered over veal medallions. Yes I eat poor caged baby cows. And I do it because they taste goooooood. My meal was perfection, with a side of al dente rigatoni in marinara and perfectly steamed petite julienne vegetables. The marsala wasn't as stellar, but I'm not the one that had to consume it, so to each their own.   The meal came with garlic bread, which was respectable, and a salad that was delish! Their house vinagrette was rockin'. We also decided to kick off the evening with a bottle of chardonnay that was chilled in one of them thingys that stands by your table.   There were balloons and streamers and live entertainment in the form of a super stellar, pitch perfect showman all tuxed out and belting out classics while playing the piano. Cutesy couples were even requesting songs and dancing with their sweeties. Aww. The sap in me just melts. See that puddle of goo at your feet? That's me. Don't step in it.  There was also a nice program they were running that night where they would take you home for a flat rate of 10 bucks within a 15 mile radius so you didn't ring in the New Year with a DUI. Now that's class.  I don't know if I'd ever go back here again (leetle on the pricey side at 20-30 bucks for an entree) but if you're in the area and looking for a dining experience rather than straight calories, hit it up!",

Very complex flavors. I've only had Escargot once before at Cafe Boa. I don't remember loving it - but I can say I'd definitely order it again now! It's served in a butter/garlic sauce at Ruffino's inside of mushroom caps. Excellent.  I thought the prices were very affordable. It's obvious the pasta is hand made. The sauces are extremely fresh. You get what you pay for!  It truly is a sophisticated place. Who would guess by the location in a strip mall?? Fresh flowers on the table, great service, live singer on a Wed. night.  Classic. All that was missing was Frank Sinatra sitting in the corner. But the live singer made up for that (on a Wednesday night even!)",

It is in a small strip mall nestled between a Dry Cleaner and a shoe repair shop.  On the inside it is a little dated, but the service and food more than make up for it.  When it comes to service, the wait staff is always extremely attentive.  The owner, Steve, is also great.  He is very hands on and always quick to address any concerns that may arise.   When we had our rehearsal dinner here, he helped come up with a custom menu and pricing instead of their typical event menu.  The food is amazing.  The mean starts out with fresh garlic bread that is out of this world.  For the entree, my wife and I are extremely fond of the Filet Mignon, which is always cooked perfectly and extremely tender.

Never even asked if this was our first visit or not.  Did the scallop wrapped bacon w/ raspberry chipotle sauce - to bad they use pre cooked bacon to wrap the scallops the bacon was cold. Garnished with lettuce tomatoes and cucumber ( over kill) Bread was really tasteless.  Salad was wilted - tasted good  Food was fair not a WOW! Okay totally a disappointment dessert TIRAMISU -- the worse that I've ever tasted!!!! Big question: Would I revisit: NO - only as part of a group would I not on my own.  Then why three stars - to be fair comparatively to other restaurants that's what they deserve. I can only say try them you might enjoy their food.",

The food is rustic Italian-American which is very rich and heavy for our taste.    First off, the scallops wrapped in bacon, was pretty good, it is an old staple in a place such as this.  Hubby ordered the Seafood Ravioli drenched in heavy cream and butter filled with chunks of seafood and cheese.  Oh, he had a side of lobster bisque...just too much!   He paired it with a Malbec, which I thought should be reserved for red meat, was I wrong.  It was perfect for cutting through the fattiness of the meal.   I thought I was safe to get the  Oyster Rockefeller, that was also topped with heavy cheese and wilted spinach.  I could even hardly taste the oysters, which was overcooked for my liking.  I've heard of Conundrum that people raved about...blech.  The worst wine I've had that cost $10 a glass.  That was not their fault, so I drank as to not waste it.  Now, the house salad was very good!  I don't remember what was in it, because it was cave-like in there.    The service was very good, eventhough the food was just so-so.  Unless that friend extends an invite, we will go again.  Otherwise...next...",

I've been to Italy, love Italy Italian, but here, I want my American Italian - veal parmigiana, fettucine alfredo and Ruffino's melt-in-your-mouth garlic bread (they did all three to perfection).  It would have been simple to keep the staples that the customers love, and simply add more.  But, alas, the new owners did away with the best items on the menu.  Not going back.

However the seafood Ruffino was amazing.  Mussels,  clams,  shrimp,  calamari,  Angel hair pasta with a marinara sauce... Perfection.    My husband had the crab stuffed salmon... It doesn't get any better and he loved it.    My son had their Alfredo tortellini and if he hadn't eaten so much garlic bread served before the meal (and his own cup of lobster bisque) he would have cleaned his plate.

The dining area was very slow for a Friday night, but there was a lively crowd and live music in the bar area. Between the strong reviews and the old school vibe, I was hoping for a classic, old school Italian meal. It wasn't bad for the East Valley, but not the best I've ever had. We ordered the mussels in white wine sauce as a starter. It was delicious. For dinner, I ordered the linguine with clams. It was a little salty, but loaded with clams and quite flavorful. My husband ordered the spaghetti with seafood with white wine sauce. He said it was good but not great. We finished the meal with the house made tiramisu. It was ok, but the lady fingers weren't even soaked and there was no chocolate. Not worth the $9 price tag. Overall, we had a pleasant meal with very attentive service.",

Not a bad meal by any means, but unsure if I'll make the trip to Tukee for this place again. Piano player and service were a high point.",

    "text": "The restaurant had the decor of a stuffy, old fashioned Italian place, so my expectations were a little low. The salad was very fresh and good, a tip-off of good things to come. I persuaded my sister to order the Carbonara, which the waitress said was made in a big wheel of cheese flambe. Really didn't get it, but too interesting to pass up. Wow! One of the owners brought out a cart with a huge wheel of cheese that had a depression in the center. He poured the creamy pasta into the center, which was aflame from some type of alcohol. He tossed the pasta for about 5 minutes in the flaming cheese while it picked up a rich glaze of Parmesan. The dish was terrific. I ordered a Pasta Arrabica (?) with sausage and artichokes, and a friend ordered eggplant Parmesan. All were great. Service was also attentive, and the owner was delightful. Highly recommended and looking forward to going back.",
