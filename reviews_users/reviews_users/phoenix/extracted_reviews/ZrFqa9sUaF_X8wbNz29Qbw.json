    "text": "Sound levels continue to be a problem with this restaurant.   Sometimes one of the machines in the center (the one for frozen yogurt? the one for ice?) makes a loud, throbbing noise that is disturbing.   Other times the music is oppressively loud.  On our last visit, when the restaurant was relatively empty, the intrusive music made it hard to converse or think about anything else.   The song tracks have tempos that are too fast for relaxing eating.    Sometimes the songs are not so much sung as \"belted out.\"   We love the food, the wait staff, and the people working hard behind the counters.   We would eat at this Sweet Tomatoes branch more often if we didn't always have to wonder what sound level and what kind of music will greet us when we arrive.",

They kitchen is wide open behind glass so  you can see just how clean it is.  The food selection is wonderful and everything is always fresh! Plenty of parking in the giant parking lot. You can even sit outside if you can stand the heat. Well, for the extra added touch.... there is a pond outside filled with fish, turtles and ducks. You can bring some food with you(Bread has no nutritional value for animals), and feed the animals either before or after you feed yourself. Kids absolutely love it! So do i!  Also they always have coupons which save a lot of $$$ as well.",

Since it's a buffet, each of us get to pick what we feel like that night.  I'm glad to see the buffet style back, with the addition of the skewers along with beer/wine. =P  Their chicken skewers are very tasty. My only slight negative is that some of the nicer soups and things that were added don't seem to be in the rotation. Great for the family, as our daughter can graze and find something that she likes.",

Also, their selection for their sides has diminished as well.  Today I even had to ask for butter, they asked what kind and then brought it out from the refrigerator and let me take one then put it back! What's with that? You have to ask for the butter now?   We also tried the pineapple upside down cake, eh so, so!  I just to love this place now it's moving way down on my list!    It's still a great value for what you get, just needs to improve their selection for the sides and PLEASE BRING BACK THE CLAM CHOWDER!",

    "text": "I've been a huge fan of Sweet Tomatoes for years.  I heard the rumors about the Field Kitchen test, but was skeptical about the actuality of the company trying something so stupid when Sweet Tomatoes has such a unique niche in the market.  Hardly anyone has this type of product anymore and the public demand seems to be thriving.    So a new Chief Executive of Garden Fresh Restaurant Corp tries to make a name for himself and invests a couple million to see how the chain can make more money on the average customer bill - by offering a few items such as alcohol and some chicken/beef skewers, plus a built in 7.5% tip for the franchise.  I heard about this last summer before it happened and I didn't believe the rumor.  Who would be that ignorant?  Very few of the changes sounded like an improvement for the customer.  In fact, most of the changes sounded like a benefit for the ownership.    Well, now we move forward in time almost a year later and the test concept failed. I visit one of the former \"Field Test\" locations several months after it converted back to the buffet style.  I'm disappointed because the location, having undergone the renovation, is a mess.  The island for beverages and soft serve is a cluster ####.  God forbid a senior try to navigate through the area with a walker or such.  It is congested and ill-conceived.    I always loved the soup and today tried the chicken noodle.  I've never been a pasta critic, but the noodles were gummy & difficult to chew.  There were no crackers for soup and my lunch companion said the other pasta choices weren't good either.    I feel bad because I always try to coax my coworkers to join me for lunch at Sweet Tomatoes.  If I do in the future, it will be at another location, like Whole Foods for their salad bar, or another concept altogether.",

    "text": "I don't understand the bad reviews against this Sweet Tomatoes. In fact, it's one of the best ones I've been to.   I love the redesign. True, most Sweet Tomatoes restaurants have a sort of \"home\" like atmosphere, but this also comes at the cost of being tacky and outdated. This one has a cool, contemporary, minimalistic sort of design that I really do enjoy. It certainly doesn't feel cheap, and I for one like that the trays are a lighter metal material than the typical heavy plastic trays. Other Sweet Tomatoes will use heavy trays so it feels like you have more food on your plate than you really do.   The soup bowls are a bit bigger so you get more soup each time you go up to serve yourself, and they also have fairly big plates for the bakery items like muffins and mac and cheese. Most Sweet Tomatoes restaurants give out TINY plates that barely fit 3 muffins on them. These plates could easily hold 8. The plates also work for the pasta; this location doesn't have those tiny oval shaped pasta trays either. Seriously, this location doesn't try to use psychological tricks to get one to take less food. You can get a bit more soup, have an almost regular sized plate (less going to the food area) all on nice looking white dishware.  They also have an updated soda machine with touchscreen that will dispense pretty much any soda (or powerade) flavor you can think of. This includes strawberry, grape, peach, and regular Sprite--in fact there are more Sprite flavors, but I just can't remember them. Also, there is more than one entrance to the food area and I think the Andrea reviewer was being a bit silly to try to squeeze through where the soda machine was as that isn't the only way to get to the food area!   Soup was utterly fantastic and had a lot of good flavor. My time-proven favorite, kettle chili, was scrumptious. The chicken and rice soup had a wonderful home-made flavor to it. The other soups were tasty as well.   The salad was just fine, and I must confess salad isn't what I primarily like about any Sweet Tomatoes restaurant as I'm not much of a salad fan anyway.   Also, it is True that this Sweet Tomatoes location doesn't have big tags indicating what each soup or salad menu item is, though the tags ARE THERE. I would almost guess that the reviewers who complained of the lack of tags just didn't look hard enough or forgot their glasses.   Honestly I think the people who have given harsh reviews are just incredibly picky. They take off 2-3 stars because there are no kidney beans (which I think they do have) in the salad line or because the ice cream which is already cheap and crappy to begin with tastes a bit watery? Silly.   Yes this location does serve alcohol, but they also serve odwalla drinks. And have a huge selection of soda.   This place is booming...seriously, most tables were full the night I went (Tuesday night) and doing well. Don't be scared by the negative reviews. Totally worth going to in it's current Sweet Tomatoes form unless something radical changes.",

What was lunch? I went with the salad - just the salad - from the gigantic salad bar. No drink. Only water. So to me, that's one expensive salad. Sure, they have plenty to pile high on your plate, but I left feeling that I could make the very same salad for 1/2 the cost.   Also, if you're in line in front of regulars on the lunch rush, be prepared to have your personal space invaded. If you're not moving fast enough, they will likely just push you forward with their own trays. Seriously. I think I managed to throw together a pretty decent salad, but the fear of the lady with the big-lady-bag scared me to the register.   I have no reason to go back.",

I mean, we all know buffets are the best because when you don't know what you want, they have everything (salad with every topping imaginable, six different soups, pizza, pasta, mac and cheese, ica cream, and much more).  At about $10 for the food and $2 for a drink, the price is a little more than I would hope for. But as I said before, they have EVERYTHING and you can literally get as much of it as you would like.   While I usually hit up Sweet Tomatoes for a large amount of decent food, I imagine it would laso be great for students with home work (I don't think there's a time limit or anything) or friends/family with children.",

I guess the location really matters or something has changed in the last 2 years.  It looks like I will be going here often for the nice warming soups.  The blueberry muffins were out of this world.

Here I thought, I'm just getting the same salads on my 2nd round, why waste water (save them from washing another plate. One of the staff suggested I get a fresh plate. When I said I was ok reusing my plate, he nicely advised that for health and sanitary reasons (to prevent accidental contamination), it would be best if I used s fresh plate. It never occurred that could happen. You learn something new everyday. I was glad he stopped me, glad he was conscientious of what clientele might do without realizing potential missteps.

They have many different varieties of soups and their salad bar is definitely the highlight. They have warm pastas, cold pasta, and a baked potato bar with normal potatoes and sweet potatoes. We always pay the money for drinks to get their strawberry lemonade, definitely worth it! I always take whatever desert they have and top it with ice cream. I would absolutely suggest joining their club to get coupons. No spam, just coupons and emails informing members about monthly flavors and special entrees. I would suggest this Sweet Tomatoes any day!",

Sometimes i wish i could eat there twice a day but that would be ridiculous even for me.. Their hot food sucks, but idc. Im a two plate salad person.. If ur a student, they offer discounts. Sometimes i dream about my next salad in class n doing fancy things with dressings. Like putting some on the bottom of the salad! Genius! The staff is friendly. I love people watching n this place does it for me too.. Oh n its cheap as hell.. Plus theres a nice park behind the building.. Only thing i wish is that it was open 24/7..

Look no further! I have found my favorite!! The Tempe location has been here for years but was remodeled about 1 1/2 years ago, according to staff. It is much nicer, comfy, warm and welcoming inside. There are glass hanging planters. There are glass jars on the table with fresh rosemary speigs. They have glass glasses! They serve beer and wine along with all your Sweet Tomatoes favorites. Allie was super friendly and really hustled to keep the dining room clean. She answered questions about the company and was very knowledgeable. All my favs, Tomato soup, wonton salad, rosemary focacia, a yummy salad with spinach, beets, etc!  The only reason it is 4 instead of 5 stars is that they don't bring around the hot chocolate chip cookies anymore and the chocolate muffins were real dry! I will go back!!",

My hands were filthy by the time I tried to serve up a plate off the buffet, from the dirty utensils.  Staff was working hard, but seemed oblivious to many empty food bins and allot of filth.  There was food all over the floor of the place, smeared in by stampeding customers. I completely lost my appetite.   I was looking for management to speak with, and they were nowhere to be found, until I snapped a couple of pictures of the disgusting food service.  Immediately, a manager appeared and I was told this was private property, and no photographs were allowed.  I spoke with the manager, who although he refunded my money, seem unapologetic and only offered up multiple excuses of how hard it was to keep up, when parents don't control their kids at the buffet....GROSS.......I submitted complaints to corporate, via the internet, last time I went here about a year ago, and never received any response whatsoever.  Management seems to know they don't keep the place up when it is busy, and they don't care.   If I ever return and the restaurant is that filthy, I will skip speaking with management, and contact the Maricopa County Department of Health Services.",

I love the large salad bar that I can't find in my own Midwestern state, and I love the large windows that let in the wonderful sunlight. At the same time, I don't think I would like to come here all the time. Not all of Sweet Tomatoes' food is vegetarian, but it leans toward the low-fat, low-protein options. That's not a bad thing in an all-you-can-eat buffet, but I'm more accustomed to eating heavier food in smaller portions. So Sweet Tomatoes is a great change in pace for me, but I always get a sense of recreational eating when I come here, rather than a meal that is designed to satisfy my hunger for the next six hours or so. I particularly enjoyed using maple cream in place of butter on my bread on this visit. That was an unusual option and a nice touch.",

The value quotient here is quite high especially for lunch. If you sign up for their email blasts, you get the meal for $8. There are even 2 person deals that include drinks.  The make your own baked potato with all the fixings has been a favorite of mine. They also kill the french onion soup! Dump in as much cheese and croutons as you like. I have never encountered spoiled veggies. everything is fresh and changed out regularly.  Only grips is during the dinner hour, Tomatoes offers up a few premium salad bar items with protien. 8/10 times these premium salad options are laced with nuts. For someone with a nut allergy, this is disappointing. Perhaps put the nuts on the side or offer the dish in a separate container without the nuts.  Rounding out the experience is a coke freestyle machine, and some delicious strawberry lemonade making paying extra for a drink truly worth it!",

    "text": "Sweet Tomatoes has seen the light and converted back to its original concept! Today was the grand reopening of this location after months of being Field Kitchen. The menu is for the most part, the same as it was before the Field Kitchen conversion, but the interior still holds the swanky bistro feel. The dinnerware also has the same nice cups, plates, and bowls that Field Kitchen had. We went for lunch, where they had some staff outside entering people for a raffle for 52 free meals. They were very friendly and very eager to make sure this new, yet familiar experience would be good for all the customers.  Your old standard dishes are back, such as the tuna tarragon and the broccoli salad, although the wonton salad is now chicken-less (At least for this month). There seems to be slightly less of a selection of toppings for your salad, to be replaced be more dressing options (Including some unique ones like smokey bacon and mango basil). As a throwback to the previous Field Kitchen days, they do offer some a la carte skewers of rosemary chicken, and fresh mozzarella with tomato for a little over a dollar. Since they nixed the fresh fruit bar during the Field Kitchen experiment, they had to move the puddings, mousses, and fresh fruit into a smallish corner of the salad bar portion of the restaurant.  The drink station is pretty awesome. There's an automated soda machine with a touch screen that has a plethora of soda and water choices with various flavor additions if you so desire. They have an increased selection of diet sodas, such as diet Seagram's ginger ale (With various flavor additions like lime), and diet Barq's (There's an option for regular diet, or vanilla diet, very cool!). There's a nice selection of teas, including a very tasty mango ginger tea, as well as various regular and strawberry lemonades.  The soups seem to be the same quality and quantity. In addition to the standard chicken noodle soup, they had at least 2 different chilis, a tomato soup, and a rich and hearty posole with big chunks of pork in it, just to name a few. The bakery selection is limited on the muffin side, although they have the same pizzas and focaccias as they did before. When we went they only had brownies and blueberry muffins available. These muffins are huge compared to the usual sized Sweet Tomatoes muffins, about twice the size of the previous mini-muffins.  The pasta section was probably the most improved since the transition back to Sweet Tomatoes. The pasta was nicely cooked, and I was a big fan of the spicy marinara. It had lots of spicy kick, and a nice rich tomato flavor. The mac and cheese seems to have improved as well.  I didn't try any of the soft serve, but they still had the standard vanilla/chocolate combo, with the various toppings and sauces to go with it.  Service was cheerful and friendly as always. After we paid, we got a 15% off coupon to use for the whole month of April. Nice!  There are a lot of good options for restaurants in this area now, with the opening of Spokes, the reopening of Sweet Tomatoes, and the highly anticipated opening of Los Reyes De La Torta. I'm glad Sweet Tomatoes is back to its original concept, and will be dining here again with frequency!  Weekend lunch: $8.99 per person Fountain drinks: $2.39, unlimited refills",

Yes, the Field Kitchen experiment has failed and Sweet Tomatoes has gone back to its old format.  Even better, with the renovation and cool new soda machine and utensils, it's better than ever.  Before the Field Kitchen phase, I was just ho-hum about this place.  Now, it's a place with such good-tasting food that I want to return on a frequent basis.  The only bad thing is that the soda machine has one spigot for over 100 flavors.  If you want a drink, you are going to need to get in line.  Apart from that, this place is primo now.  My family and I aren't the only ones happy to see this place back and better-- when we visited recently, it was PACKED.  Lots of veggie options only sweeten the deal here.  Pile on your plates and chow down!",

There are basically two zones of food (Salad vs. soup, desert, pasta). Everyone can take two plates on a tray every time (kinda hard to put everything I want in a plate :P). It's also a ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT restaurant. I love every vegetable&fruit there.   Second, when the weather is cold and I just want a bowl of hot soup, I go! More than 7 kinds of soups. The Big Chunk Chicken Noodle is the best, even though sometimes it might be too salty. chocolate/blueberry/coconut Muffins are all good. Baked sweet potato is bomb. Pizza and pasta are ok. I'm not a big fan of these choices.     Third, when you wanna SAVE $$, please go. There is no place healthier and cheaper than sweet tomatoes. I can have all nutrients I need in a day but absolutely yummy and healthy.",

    "text": "I went to Sweet Tomatoes last night at the Scottsdale location.  And it's not even worth reviewing that location because it is so normal.  There is nothing particularly good about it, nor bad about it.    But THIS location, THIS location has things worth mentioning. And so here I  go:  1) They have a super soda machine that makes 100 flavors. I always do the diet mellow yellow grape. 2) They have abnormally fancy plates. 3) They have cottage cheese at the salad bar. I like cottage cheese. 4) They have chocolate (or sometimes strawberry) mousse at the salad bar. Other Sweet Tomatoes have this as well, but they put it by the ice cream, alluding that it is a dessert.  Moving the mousse to the salad bar implies that it is meant to be eaten with your salad.  CHOCOLATE MOUSSE FOR DINNER. I should just end this review right here. 5) They serve beer. 6) They serve meat on wooden sticks (but you have to pay more). 7) They changed their corn muffins into delicate little corn cakes. 8) It is by a very interesting pond that has an abundance of turtles. One day, they make take over the world.",

    "text": "I was craving some of my Aunt Martha's homemade chicken noodle soup. Since Aunt Martha passed away 10 years ago the closest version that came to mind is one that Sweet Tomatoes used to make (I was unsure if it was still available following the failed Field Kitchen format experiment). It has the fat noodles, mild broth and huge chunks of chicken. Mmmmmmmm.  I arrived at Sweet Tomatoes right at 11am. Loaded up on salad (I love that they have pickled beets). They now offer the option of a protein source to top your salad for a couple of bucks extra. I skipped that since I was looking forward to the chicken noodle soup. Once I set my tray down, I made a beeline for the soup. There it was. The holy grail--Aunt Martha's chicken noodle soup! It was the same as I remembered. I wolfed down my soup and salad. I went back for a bowl of Irish potato-leek soup and some pizza bread. I skipped the pasta bar, baked potato bar and the desserts. I was sated and for just $7.99 (adult $8.99 lunch with a dollar off coupon).   The decor is a little more upscale than it was before the format changes. I am a little puzzled by some picture/wall hangings that resemble forest moss gone wild. The staff was friendly and helpful. The food tasted fresh. The noise level was bearable (last visit it was deafening). If you don't mind cafeteria style service and have a serious hankering for soup and salad, this is the place for you!",

Her name is Diana!  Make sure to ask NOT to be seated in her section!  To top it off we asked 3 times to have our table cleaned while we were eating....plates piled up and finally a gentleman came but we were leaving at that point.....sad that we paid so much money and didn't even enjoy our family night out",

This Arizona location looks MUCH cleaner and nicer overall than the one in my hometown, so I was expecting the food to be just as good or better.  However, the food was completely below par. I tried a little bit of everything and found that all of the pre-made salads and soups were way too salty. Even the desserts weren't good. Where were the blueberries in the \"blueberry muffins\"?! So disappointing...  I wouldn't want to return here unless I had absolutely no other choice.",

Food is fresh, soups are good, the staff takes care of things.  My issue is not with the company, just this location...and in just one regard: NO FRUIT!  This location for some reason never has fruit on hand, they only offer frozen yogurt and junk food muffins for dessert, and ZERO healthy fruit options. Frozen yogurt is loaded with sugar and it is really no different than ice cream despite what advertising tells you. Not to mention the fudge and caramel fountain right next to the soft serve machine make it a truly white sugary nightmare. In a salad bar that caters to healthier eating, there should be healthy options for dessert, not ONLY frozen yogurt sugar and a sprinkle station and white sugar/enriched muffins.  I have avoided this location because of this, If I go to sweet tomatoes now I go out of my way to the location on Ray Road and the 10, they have fruit all the time, this one never does. It's weird, it makes no sense, and it should be fixed. A healthy eatery should have all healthy options.",

We both like eating healthy-er, and love salads and veggies, so the huge salad bar for us never gets old! (Although I don't know how healthy it is when half your salad is black olives..) The soups are also pretty good. I love the asian broth one, and any of the broccoli soups:) I went to sprouts today and bought a ton of stuff to make salads, but a sharp knife and I don't get along all that great unless there's a bloody mess involved. I'd much rather save an hr and a trip to the ER and come to Sweet Tomatoes:)",

A couple of months ago there was a gift card promotion, so I got 1 for my parents' anniversary and 1 for me to use.  My parents used their gift card on their anniversary and should have gotten the Senior discount of $7.49 each when they go before 4 pm; they went around 1ish.  They were charged the regular adult price.  On top of that the cashier did not give them back their card.  A few weeks later when I meet my Mom for lunch and we talked about their gift card, she said they used it all during the ONE visit for both of them.  I went online to check the balance, then called the customer service #.  All they can do was take down my information and someone will contact me.  That was 3 weeks ago.    My parents live around the corner from this location and we all come here often, but after I use up my gift card WE won't be coming back.  I will find another place for us go.  Talk about ripping off people - how does it feel to rip off the old folks Sweet Tomatoes?",

And our waiter, Oscar, was very quick to clear the table and he helped the kids make special deserts. One of the things I like most about Sweet Tomatoes is that you make your own plate and it's quick, but that usually means very little interaction with staff and not much opportunity to impact the experience but in this case, the staff made a great impression.",

One of the gentlemen offered to refill my water (I have never experienced this at other locations as it is a buffet setting), I also watched him switch a family's baby from a supplied wheeled chair used to cart them easier through the salad line into a standard high chair so she didn't have to strain to sit up to eat. All staff were very friendly creating a great end to my evening.",

That alone shows you this is a great company.  We have been long time fans of Sweet Tomatoes and before, the food was very yummy. After their Field Kitchen trial and return back to their original, their food has become delicious! There are more choices on the salad bar (LOVED the sliced apple), blueberry muffins are bigger and tastier, soda machine is updated, and everything else just tastes better.  Sweet Tomatoes has really stepped up their game and I cannot see any business in the area compete with them. On top of the great food and reasonable price, the staff is just so helpful and friendly. Everyone smiles and says hello, goodbye, thank you, etc. This experience was so great that the wife and I ALMOST went back the next day!  Go in to eat, visit, and relax. I would give them 6 stars if I could.",

The salad bar was fresh & good (as usual), the soups were not so good and lacked ingredients.  The lobster bisque had some lobster flavor but no lobster.  The chuncky chicken only had bioled chicken and noodles.  You will need to try for yourself i guess.   The worst was the cleanliness.   Not once did a buser come to our table to pick up our dishes.  The same with the other tables.  A party left 20 min before us and when we left it still wasnt cleaned up.  The drink and ice cream area was messy too.  I dont know if they were short staff but it didnt feel good.",

Downside was the amount of people which causes problems downstream. Clean bowls and plates were a hot item and silverware for certain things (spoons) were hard to find. When they did come, they weren't 100% dry and some food was still stuck. I found myself going through 6 bowls at one point to find a good one to use for soup. Certain food items they couldn't keep up with having available like focaccia or even stuff from the salad bar. They were probably short handed but it was a bit more chaotic then I was ready for. All in all, when it's not crowded you can get a solid balanced meal with an emphasis on salad!",

    "text": "There is a certain trust that comes with the words \"all you can eat\". It is the warm, welcoming reassurance that this establishment encourages gluttons from all over the world to eat, drink, and be merry. It is a sign that full bellies are nigh. Sweet Tomatoes breaks that trust.  I am a veteran of AYCE buffets of different styles: Chinese, Indian, breakfast, continental. They all have one thing in common; they are flavorful, and filling, because eating your fill is a pleasing experience. Sweet Tomatoes would be better called Bland Tomatoes, because tomatoes these days are usually quite bland, and so is their food selection.  Seriously, when was the last time you just bit into a tomato? Try it. It sucks, just like this food.  They start by walking us through their salad bar where we fill our trays with an array of salad ingredients. Salads are not known for being filling, or flavorful on their own, so that means that we defeat the whole purpose of this health food buffet by using salad dressing. There are also bland potato salad, flavorless pasta, and \"trust me, it's great\" tuna salad options to mix into our greens.  We can also pay $3 extra for a chicken patty, because every AYCE buffet has some kind of upsell, and meat is theirs. Yup, Sweet Tomatoes leans vegetarian, so there is no room for bulking up your swole here. $3 also feels steep for a single patty of meat, and I sincerely hope that the $3 upsell buys as much chicken as we want, although I doubt it. On my visit I opted for the basics.  We then pay to enter, and then eat the vegetables on our plate, which are high water content vegetables like lettuce in the first place. After that unsatisfying experience we are free to explore their hot food options, which are a little more interesting.  Their saving grace is the baked sweet potatoes, filling, flavorful, wrapped in foil, and ready for us to grab. We can eat them plain, or use the nearby potato toppings to sweeten the deal. The soups are also pretty enjoyable. The chili was great. Sweet Tomatoes is too cool for pizza, because they are supposed to be healthy: they serve cheese foccaccia, because this cheese bread is some how better than that other cheese bread.  After filling on the light, watery foods that Sweet Tomatoes serves I finally stood up to leave.The filling sensation was mostly water weight though: remember those water heavy vegetables, and soups. So yes, technically I ate all I could, but Sweet Tomatoes just definitely broke that AYCE trust, and I had to run crying to the open arms of Golden Corral.",

You go through the salad bar first, pay, get seated, then you can go to the salad bar again or the soup station.  There's usually about 6 soups to choose from, some flatbread, and three types of pasta. The salad bar itself has several options including a couple premixed salads. A few of my favorite items are the wonton happiness salad, the seafood salad, the quinoa salad, joans broccoli madness, the sweet potato corn chowder, and the broccoli cheddar. For desserts there is brownies, a soft serve machine, and sugar free chocolate mousse.",

However, when it comes to this Sweet tomatoes I am all in! When you first walk in there is an array of freshly made salads I recommend the Caesar it is wonderful! You can also make your own salad with everything you could think of on it if you want to be creative! The renovation they did on this specific location is lovely. I really like how it is more modern up now. Next thing to try is the delicious variety of soups . My all time favorite thing is how they have a set up to make your own baked potato. My father makes the best so I love when we go together because I get to year a scrumptious loaded up potato!     The best thing about this Sweet Tomato is the staff is very kind and professional it seems like they really care about your experience.   Thanks Sweet Tomato! Until Next time!",

I did like that. There was anything ranging from broccoli cheddar to minestrone to chicken noodle.   Kind of a Panera Bread meets Golden Corral which could be a dream for some.

They also serve baked potatoes and sweet potatoes. The bakery has different types of muffins and breads.The chocolate lava cake is so gooey(it melts in your mouth) they also have beverages and a Mean Soda Machine. If you still have room in your stomach try the hot pastas and some ice cream(chocolate/vanilla or both) with sprinkles and chocolate/caramel before you leave.

Salad bar is great and you can create your own huge salad just the way you like it. Soup and pasta bars are great too.  Can be busy depending on when you come. We usually try to arrive on the off times and can get a quiet clean table. If you go when it's busy, it's hit or miss.",

The pre-made salads are good - I like some better than others, but that's why there are choices! Love the cream of mushroom soup and the tomato soup. The baked goods are very good - but I miss the chocolate chip muffins (haven't seen those for a while).   This place is very popular for families, which means kids. I see some complaints from other reviewers about noise and mess. Granted, they sometimes need to clean up the ice cream toppings area more often and if you go to eat late the floors get a bit messy. Note to the staff: If you have customers still eating and it's not closing time yet, clean the floors.  If parents would actually monitor their kids and teach them how to respect an area shared with other people, that would be super helpful, too.",

I wanted soup but I was full.  My favorites are the desserts because I love soft serve ice cream. I concocted dessert from crushed Oreos, chocolate lava cake and vanilla ice cream. The best!

We got our food, paid, and once we were checking out the hostess dropped two things of cookies in front of us - which was super odd.   The food was great, we only ate what we got the first time which came to 16$ and we both didn't feel it was worth it.

I don't typically go to buffets because the food is usually old and bad for you, but this place was nothing like that. They had a full salad bar right when you walk in and everything was super fresh! They had any topping you could possibly think of.  I forgot to take pictures of my food, so here is what my roommate ate. I myself loaded up a plate of salad with tons of toppings and thoroughly enjoyed it!  My one complaint is that they didn't offer protein to add on top of the salads (I.e. cut up grilled chicken), but I can see that it would be expensive to do that.  My experience with the staff was great. The lady at the register allowed me to check in and use the 15% off offer, but also gave me an additional percentage off my meal for it being my first time. I was able to join the email list and have already received coupons for my next time around (which can be used directly from your phone)!  Definitely recommend this place to people looking for a healthy option. They also have a staff member picking up plates as you go and wiping things down.  They did also have soups, some breads and fresh made muffins, a baked potato bar, pastas etc.  Plenty of drink options and they have the frozen yogurt machine of course.  I spent less than $11 which included a drink, so using the check in offer, you should expect to spend around that amount. From what I understood, you could eat as much as you want.  I will be back!",

One thing that I will say that I like is the fact that each item on their food carts are clearly labeled whether or not they are vegetarian or vegan friendly. This makes it really easy to figure out what to take to eat and not have to keep asking every time. Service is pretty quick to clear your table after finishing a plate so it doesn't pile up too.",

We walked in and grabbed a tray and two plates (though I'd recommend one of these large plates as two does not fit on the tray side by side, learned that the hard way folks). The first part of the restaurant is the salad bar where you can choose from several pre-made salads or create your own. I went for a mix of the two and tried some of the pasta salads but wouldn't get those again. At the register, you can get a drink (cup or bottled water) and I'm not sure if the bottle is a separate price. Cost for lunch is $10 but checking in with the Yelp app saves you 15% on lunch and dinner, very nice.  I decided to do one trip and I got my drink and hot foods before I sat down. There's pizza and bread, soups, pastas and desserts. I liked the cream of mushroom soup and the wonton salad, but many of the dishes tasted bland and needed some spice/hot sauce. Didn't look to see if they offered that. I really like how they label everything as being GF, vegetarian, and vegan, it's super helpful!  This place is an affordable lunch/dinner spot and seems to be fairly healthy, depending on what you choose. I wouldn't go on a regular basis but I'd come back for a filling, quick meal.",

Getting coupons in the mail or through the Sweet Tomatoes club definitely makes coming here more attractive-buy 1 meal, get 1 free . Hard to beat a meal for two for around $10.   The food has always been fresh with a wide variety of options to place on your lettuce. There are usually about 5 choices of soup/chili.  The Chinese Chicken salad is always a good option.  I enjoy the blueberry muffins.  We went here the other night and were treated to a pretty good strawberry and apple cobbler. In the past, we went when the dessert was carrott cake and that was very good.  The self serve ice cream is always a nice touch or to use and make a root beer float.  This location is usually busy, the couple of times we've gone  but not too loud.  We've only gone on Sunday evening and mid week though.",

They did have croutons separately towards the end of the counter, so I didn't understand why they had to put them into the ceasar salad in the first place! I took the egg salad, the croutons and lettuce and some cherry tomatoes and cucumber slices. I hunted in vain for some grilled chicken or prawn toppings, but there was none. The seating area was good though...spacious, with comfortable bench chairs. I liked the bread and soups waaaay better than the salads. They had garlic bread and an assortment of soups including chilli soup, french onion soup, clam chowder and tomato soup. Opposite the soup counter they have a small frozen yogurt vending machine. All in all, an overpriced eating experience, and I wasn't even satisfied with what I got. I don't think I am coming back here unless someone else is paying :P",

I've yet to encounter any of the freshness issues.. in fact, everything I've had has been super fresh! Most of their prepared salads are downright tasty, especially the Chicken Won Ton Salad.. a classic! As for the soups, and hot foods, 2 stars, on their best day.  Their soups just aren't that great, and I've tried just about each one... Today the featured soup was lemon orzo and it was absolutely inedible.. Their chicken noodle, is decent, and so is their potato soup, most of the time.. just don't be surprised if you get raw potatoes sometimes. Not uncommon.  They've got a nice selection of carb-tastic breads/pizza type things, which aren't what I'm really there for.. If you're going here to eat healthy, you may as well avoid the hot foods all together. All things considered, the full dinner price, with drink is a bit over $13.00.. The Casino Arizona buffets aren't much more expensive, and neither are the top Asian buffets in the valley. Finally, this place is CRAWLING with some of the most insufferable brats suburbia can offer.",

Sweet tomatoes: and endless ocean of comfort foods, all you can eat for a low price. Sounds too good to be True doesn't it? I've been eating here since I was a little kid, not at this one specifically but at this chain. It is called Souplantation in California. A huge line of salad goodies (a ton of yummy treats, too many to name), usually 6-8 different soups, potato bar, pasta bar, bread bar, muffin/dessert bar, fruit/jello etc..., and a soft serve bar. Not to mention they have a pretty great beverage selection. It's hard to not overeat here but I never feel guilty since I eat so many veggies while I'm here. Beware if you go at 6, this place gets rocking for dinner. If you're lucky, you'll be there while they walk around with hot chocolate chip cookies. Bottom line. You like choices, you like salad bars?

It is a little overpriced esp. for lunchers considering your drink is extra.  This is the same chain as Soup Exchange I believe, and I recall that drinks were included in the SE buffet.  Plus they served cookies for lunch as well as dinner and had a variety of whole fruits, not just an occasional banana.  Could be Soup Plantation that is affiliated w/ST.  Ok, back to Sweet T.   The worst aspect of any buffet, is the rude people that insist on reaching over your plate to fill their tray, rather than waiting for you to slide away, where they can shovel directly in front of the bowl to the plate, or the inconsiderate eaters that make old people with walkers wait while they pass carelessly back to inhale more food instead of allowing the less able get by first.  Where are the manners and respect for your elders, esp when disabled.  Oh, wait! There's the parents that let the little kids dig through the food as if they're at home, not in a public restaurant, contaminating everything for the next unsuspecting diner.  Parents, get up and serve your children when in public!!  This isn't the time to give them choices.  What is wrong with people?   Where is the discipline?    WHY is it that most parents of youngin's today do NOT teach basic manners from the time they are babies?  Do they think their kid is that inept that they must wait until they're so old at 10 when it won't be 2nd nature anymore?",

The lady that checked us out was nice and asked if we wanted drinks but I said no. She handed us cups anyways so I was a little confused but didn't think anything of it. I didn't realize that these were just \"water\" cups and got some lemonade with my lunch. When we were almost finished an employee came up to me and started saying that these cups are strictly for water and I need to go and pay two dollars because I got lemonade instead. He was very rude and also he grabbed another glass for me and brought it to me and tried to take my other glass but at that point I was bothered enough by the situation and left. I'm not one to take advantage of a business but I'm also not okay with being reprimanded for getting lemonade instead of water. Won't be going back to this location!",

With that being said, the salad bar is usually clean and stocked and they've got a nice selection. I'm just not eating enough soup and salad to make this place worth the amount I have to pay to eat here. I'd rather pay $7 for soup and salad somewhere else.",

Comes with complimentary bread. Chicken was good and moist. Mashed potatoes have no taste and Mac & cheese is dry without the slightest taste of cheese! Tried the cornbread which is so dry it literally leaves a gritty residue in your mouth. The focaccia bread is on the oily side and the batch we got was way overloaded with rosemary. Also got the fettuccine pomodoro which is cooked fresh to order and wasn't bad but definitely nothing I'd order again. I like the new look but definitely not the new food.",

Pros: salad is usually fresh Good caesar salad Good balsamic dressing nice selection of soups Sweet potatoes!  Cons: -The soups aren't always very good... I think the best one that I've had is the albondigas while today I had the chicken stew which was too salty and the veggies weren't cooked enough. -The pasta is generally over cooked -The desserts are pretty meh -The breakfast is also very meh.... for example, the oatmeal is watery, the eggs are flavorless, and some combinations are really odd (today they had mediterranean pasta with scrambled egg in it...weird...)  So I will probably come back here again for lunch/dinner (not breakfast...ugh) due to the convenience factor and the fact that they send me coupons all the time, but I would definitely not pay full price....",

The salads and topping always taste fresh and the soups are always very tasty. I love how they rotate specialty items every week it seems so you get to try new soups, salads, desserts and more.   You could eat super healthy here, but you can also fill up to the point that you need to be rolled out very quickly. Even the kids plate you can get for the little ones has more than enough room for plenty of food.   As far as this location specifically, it is my favorite. They recently remodeled not only their decor, but their overall operating structure in general. Definitely a vast improvement to what they were and compared to some of the other Sweet Tomatoes locations. Sine the change, I have not had a bad experience here.",

So on a scale of 1-10, I would say that Sweet Tomatoes gets about an eight. Why only an eight? Because today I actually looked at my receipt when I pulled it out of my purse and before I threw it away.   The salad at Sweet Tomatoes is not cheap; nor too expensive . . . but, oh my goodness, I nearly had a heart attack when I saw that I paid $2.39 for a little dinky glass filled with ice cubes and about 4 oz of tea. Yes, I could have returned to the drink dispenser and refilled my glass a half dozen times until I had consumed $2.39 worth of tea. But, $2.39? . . .  at what is a glorified fast food salad bar? Next time I will be drinking water . . . unless they start charging me for that too.",

And I love all the soup options, bread, pasta and ice cream as well.  The Sweet Tomatoes on Southern and McClintock though is terrible. It used to be a regular ST, but it closed and opened as the Field Kitchen experiment. I never went there when it was like that, but I heard it was bad.  The reopening of this location with the promise that they are \"just like every other Sweet Tomatoes\" out there is so unTrue. First of all, the whole place reeks of rosemary from the chicken they grill at the end of the salad line. It's super overwhelming. Second, the options in the salad bar aren't marked (so you get to guess what you're dumping on your plate) and they don't have nearly as many options as other locations.  The layout is horrendous as well. To get to the soups, pastas and breads, you have to walk through the line that is inevitably standing at the ice cream machine. Which is in competition with the line at the soda machine - because there isn't enough room for everyone to get around. And put in more than one soda machine for crying out loud! Especially when the ice takes freaking forever to dispense.  I will continue to go to Sweet Tomatoes, but definitely not this one. I'll drive out of my way to go to one that I know is real and still good.",

I like to go there after working out down the street at Planet Fitness.  The reason I am disappointed is that I cannot get a to-go container without paying an additional $7.69.  I have had Gastric Sleeve surgery years ago and cannot eat a lot of food at one time.  So this time I put a little too much food on my plate and rather than waste it, I was hoping to bring the remainder home to finish and was told I would need to purchase a container.  This would have been the most expensive salad (only once thru the line) that I have ever had.  The cashier was all too excited to just throw it out and offer no consolation or care.  I will make sure that I make a better decision next time when I have to choose a place to eat, or perhaps I need to bring my own to-go container.  If you do not eat a lot at one time, I do not recommend this place to eat, unfortunately.",

    "text": "My hubby and I are all about buffets, so when we found this all-you-can-eat SALAD buffet we thought we'd try it out to be healthy.  Everything is very FRESH. Mon-Wed they have a 2 for $20 dinner meal which is a great price! They even allow the ''premium toppings'' like tofu & grilled chicken which normally costs $2 extra per plate.   Once you walk in, you're not really greeted but the salad line automatically starts. It starts off with some pre-made salads but then you can continue the line and make your own with your own toppings.   There's a hot station that includes 4-5 different soups and some breads (just okay not fabulous).  They have a delicious berry tea drink that is seasonal but their strawberry lemonade was too sweet/sugary for me.",

    "text": "It always starts out great here but seems to gradually slide downhill after the first few bites. Most salad options look fairly good and I think I have been lucky in my selection. There area also other cold salads on the bar. Tuna Noodle Salad of some type typically is one I'll try but on this visit is was soupy and just blech.  I couldn't even have a second bite. The soup selection on the day we visited was good, but I guess I'm one that just likes soup.  I had the Chicken Enchilada on that day.  Lots of good flavor but I don't think I even had a bite of chicken.  Also tried the Chili but it was more beans than anything.  I mean every bite was a spoon full of beans.  My husband and sons theory is that I need to laddle a serving up from the middle of the pot and refrain from stirring the soup first.  I wasn't going to serve up another bowl to find out.  Dessert is always a must even if it's just a bite of something sweet to end the meal. On this occasion they had Red Velvet Cake with a cream cheese icing.  Looked appealing, well except for what it begins to look like after a couple dozen people attempt to serve thierself from a dish set under a hot lamp. Oh yeah, and it doesn't help that they provide a long handled SPOON to cut and serve yourself a piece of cake.   C'mon staff, even one of those pizza servers would be 100 times better than a SPOON!  One bite of the RVC and some vanilla soft serve was more than enough.  We come every few months cuz that's more than enough for us.    If you miss out on the Mon-Wed deal as another reviewer mentioned, I suggest you do a search online for coupons.  You might be surprised what you find.",

Their food is never frozen and has no preservatives, they have a huge salad bar with a lot of different toppings, like 5 soups everyday that're made from scratch, and an awesome bakery that dishes out healthy pizza (like pizza breads).

    "text": "Sweet Tomatoes, you can have your 4th star back and a 5th for good measure.  You've redeemed yourself from the Field Kitchen fiasco and are once again the all-you-can-eat salad bar we'd come to know and love.  The cool thing is that this location got to keep the Field Kitchens decor, which was really quite nice.  The interior looks fresh, chic, and has plants growing out of the walls, hanging from the ceiling, and in vases on the tables.  The family dining table is a nice touch too.  The food (including the mac 'n cheese) is back to it's previous quality.  I've newly discovered the french onion soup, which is fantastic.  And they brought back the sprinkles for your ice cream! Whew!  Sweet Tomatoes, I appreciate what you tried to do, but I even more appreciate that you listened to your customer's [loud] opinions and put your restaurant back to normal.  And great job on improving things to even better than before.",

    "text": "This place has not MOVED! It is just changed names back to Sweet Tomatoes again.  OK, here is a word to the wise. If it is not broken ,do not fix it. This was one of our favorite Sweet Tomatoes to go to. We really liked it , plus it was close  by. Then they changed it to Test Kitchen or something, and it flopped big time. So now they have changed it all back to Sweet Tomatoes, or so they say!  We came here last night for dinner. We were pretty excited because, we really liked Sweet Tomatoes. Well, now it looks very industrial. The lovely plants that are growing outside on the planters are all starting to die. This is an indication of what is going on inside.  Everything is tin now. TIn strays and ice cream bowls and all the containers they put the soup and other items in to.   Nothing looks like it used to. It all looks cheap, like they have changed the ingrediants. Because, it certainly tastes like they have. They have glass glasses now,which I do like better than the plastic. The Pasta looks aweful, we could not even try it. It just looked bad.  The salad was good, but they have taken away things like the chickpeas and the kidney beans. In its place they have a 3 bean salad type thing.  They did still have sunflower seeds and raisins  which  is good,as well as the Joan's Brocili dish.  But, even the soup seems differant. The lemon Orzo tasted like fake flavors and hardly any chicken. The Chili was a little better with more meat. But, I have to say I was in no way impressed. They do not even have real Butter anymore. It is margarine and flavored Butter, I just want the real thing.  What they were presenting as Ice Cream was not, More like an Ice Milk that had an artificial taste to eat. No one ever came to clear a single dish away from our table. The staff used to be so good about that. Maybe most of them have left because, it has all changed and they are losing money as well. With no so much tipping.  I can honestly say we will never be back to this location,if it stays as it is.  I guess we will drive out to Phoenix, or Awahtukkee.  We used to go to Sweet Toms once a week. But, not know. The have ruined it.  Oh I forgot to mention that they now serveAlcohol. I just do not see why that is needed at all. This is suppose to be healthy dining.",

I always make a huge salad packed with fresh spinach, edamame, tofu, and fresh veggies. By the time I get to the hot foods they have I'm pretty full but always save a bit of room. They have food for a variety of diets. Fresh food to boot and for the price you can't beat it. If you were to go out and get a salad jam packed with all the super foods you find here you'd pay quite a bit more! Also, look for coupons. They regularly send out lunch and dinner specials so you'll save $5-$10! This location is nice, clean and they made renovations to feel more earthy and zen. All of the locations are nice though :-)",

    "text": "So, for those from California, this is Soup Plantation...owned by the same company and all.  This is a great place if you're looking for a buffet type restaurant with a little variety.  The food isn't exceptional but it'll do in a pinch.  For the salad, I would suggest making your own.  The premade salads at the beginning of the salad bar have way too much dressing and that's unfortunate...I really enjoy a good Caesar salad.  The soups are pretty much hit or miss; although, sometimes they actually do have a delicious soup hidden in there.  They also have a variety of pastas and breads to choose from, so not a bad place to try if you're unsure of what you have a taste for.",
