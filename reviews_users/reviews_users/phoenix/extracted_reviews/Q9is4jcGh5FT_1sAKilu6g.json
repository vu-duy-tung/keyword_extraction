I stood in line and people were telling me what a GREAT place it is. I haven't had a doughnut in 5 years... it was DELICIOUS!!!  I went on to purchase Two Sandwiches, 2 Doughnuts, 2 Scones, Cookies and Sweet Bread and a Loaf of Bread and Two Iced Teas... Everything was amazing!!! Being Gltuen Free for 4 years has changed my life and transformed my health. However, finding a place such as Jewel's has not been found here in Temecula, CA - I would highly recommend this Cafe and since I visit AZ fairly often, I plan on coming back again and again!  P.s. I took everything home and shared half with my beautiful daughter who also cannot eat Gluten.... She was thrilled and ate her doughnut as fast as I did :o)",

Make sure you check the menu on the register counter-- they told us they're working on updating the menu/experimenting with some things.   Their baked goodies do look good, so I'll give it another shot (free with Yelp check-in!).",

I eat paleo so I didn't try the hash browns, but they looked great!  I did eat the kale chips that they out in with the potatoes and they were amazing.   After we are I had to try some of the pastries  and they were out of donuts so I will have to go back :). I did try the blueberry scone and the lemon curd cupcake. Amazing!!!    I will for sure go back. And most likely for lunch!!    Thanks for opening",

Every time I go there it's busy and there's a little bit of a wait, but I don't have a problem with that. The busier the better I don't want this place going anywhere.  All the staff was very friendly especially chef brad. He took time to answer my questions and came by several times to make sure everything was good. I never see him not doing something, you can tell he is really passionate about what he does I honestly thought he owned the place.  The atmosphere was also great at jewels, I couldn't even tell I was in a stripe mall. Overall a wonderful experience I would recommend it to anyone!",

The menu said it had shaved white cheddar, avocado and came in a tortilla bowl... all of these things were missing.  So, I basically ended up with romaine lettuce with some corn, black beans, unripe tomatoes and a few tortilla strips. To add to the disappointment, the few pieces of chicken that were on the salad were still pink and rubbery! I had to get back to work so the salad was to-go - otherwise, I would have said something while I was in the restaurant. I'm hoping this was just an off day for Jewel's because I used to really like this place :(",

I had the basic breakfast which came with a pancake, eggs, sausage patty and potatoes.   I asked for bell pepper and onions in the egg, which they forgot.  The pancake was totally doughy and chewy in the middle and was not all that great.   The \"Potato hash\" was just breakfast potatoes and very bland.  I mean, it wasn't awful, it was just so so.  The sausage patty was soooo good, I think they must make it there or something.  That was the only redeeming part of this breakfast and why I would return.  And, I would return because the space was a cool spot and conveniently located and with easy parking.  The service was a bit slow, it took 10-15 mins to get my food.  I will go back and try them again, and perhaps try an omlette or something.",

    "text": "Not sure what's going on here. Been coming to Jewel's for well over a year now. Have always loved it in the past. Over the course of the last 8+ months I noticed items falling off the menu. Usually my favorites. Each time I would try something different as a substitution. Two weeks ago I returned with my partner and each ordered something different. I had the Eggs Benedict which I have had several times in the past. This time the two flat breads (their version of English Muffins) had been replaced by a more rubbery single flat bread. The sauce which I had loved in the past this time required so much salt, I looked like a crazy man shaking the salt shaker over and over. My partner got the special which was the right choice as it was balanced and tasty. And then he found a long hair in it. The staff removed the plate and a little while later replaced it with a fresh one. I know these things happen, but it's very nasty. With the remade breakfast came a free entree card and an apology which was appreciated.   We returned today to yet another menu. (It's only been two weeks.) This menu even smaller. Eggs Benedict removed. Prices raised. I asked the guy at the counter what was going on. His response was \"I don't know... They got rid of like half of the menu.\" So again I looked for a substitute. When we finally made it up to order we were told it would be at least 30 min to get food out to the table. At this point, it was not worth it. We purchased a scone which was good (the reason for 2 stars) and found a different place for breakfast. Ultimately a good decision. We probably will not be returning. Even with the free breakfast.",

    "text": "This place was recommended by an old coworker of mine in Albuquerque. We love trying new places and this place is a total gem!! I will start off only saying we ordered a couple kids breakfasts for our kids and there seemed to be some confusion on how it comes. Also, my kids have never really been into box juices and that's what comes with breakfast. This is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. On to the important part, the food!!  I ordered the biscuits and gravy. Which I must say was Devine! The biscuit was tender and fluffy, the gravy, not at all heavy or filled with pan drippings, no guilt! it also had a nice amount of sausage in it. It came with a sausage patty and not the standard round nasty things that come in a box, rather one that was formed by hand and cooked on site! To finish off my plate, it came with beautiful pan fried potatoes that are tossed with fried kale, just a perfect plate of love in my book.   My hubby got the breakfast sandwich, I was so in love with my food, I didn't really pay attention to what was on it, I'm pretty sure a biscuit loaded with eggs, bacon and cheese? Either way he ate every bite and enjoyed it. His also came with the same pan fried potatoes, they are so good!  My kids had a (kids menu?) breakfast, so one pancake each, a side of fruit and a box juice. We thought the breakfast came with eggs and what not, so we had to order a side of it. Like I said earlier, a tad confusing. We initially ordered waffles, but I guess the iron was not on. Either way, the server made good with us and was very nice, so it really wasn't an issue. My kids love pancakes too.   On the way out we decided to grab a 4 pack of cupcakes. I must say, I'm glad we did! We got a carrot cake cupcake, red velvet cupcake, a lemon curd cupcake and blueberry muffin. These were probably some of the best cupcakes I've had. Moist, dense, light and not overly sweet. Just Devine!   I love finding good places to eat. We will definitely be back!!",

Neither of us took advantage of the baked goods but I have my eye on a couple of things for the next visit.  Jewel's is known for being gluten-free but none of our  food was lacking in flavor  or balance.  It's got a nice, low key ambiance and good service.  This place is cute and worth supporting.

We ended up throwing away the biscuits and gravy it was unedible! The pancakes were OK but nothing I would go back for especially with all these restaurants in Phoenix.  The pancakes were $9 and online it showed they had different flavors so I ended up getting the strawberry pancakes. The lady didn't tell me there was an upcharge of $1.50 for the strawberries which I don't mind but there were only 1 1/2 whole sliced strawberries on my plate!

Today, I wish I hadn't spent the $20 I did. The muffin I ordered was dry. And the Waffle Breakfast Sandwich I had was downright gross. The sausage tastes like it was one of those \"Aidell\" sausages you can buy at the grocery. The eggs on the sandwich were burnt (hard, crispy, and chewy), how eggs should never be. The waffle was ok. But I've had better.   I'm just really disappointed. I probably won't come back any longer.  This is the final straw in an increasing series of disappointing experiences here. It was great up until about 2 years ago. I kept hoping it would come back around but it doesn't have the same feel it used to and the food has gone downhill steadily.   Sad. I hope you guys can turn it around.",

We proceeded to order the famous chicken and waffles and the breakfast sandwich. I liked the chicken and waffles - it tasted fresh and the sauce that came with it was perfect! I could've used a little more chicken though as they were a little stingy on the chicken.  The breakfast sandwich was ok - a little dry and lacked flavor. It could use some avocado and a type of spread. Since I checked in on Yelp, I got a free GF chocolate chip cookie and that was delicious!   Overall, I like the restaurant and I love eating gluten free (when I can) so this place definitely allows me to do just that!",

We snagged the last one, and also got a Oreo cupcake (not dairy-free) to go.   We were both pleasantly surprised by the texture and flavor of both treats! Both were moist, soft, fluffy and delicious. It was just what we had hoped for!  The only downside? I wish there were more dairy-free and gluten-free options. Most of their gluten-free donuts and cupcakes (besides 1 flavor of cupcake) all contained dairy, and all contained eggs (for those wondering).   I would definitely come back though, and most likely stay for brunch. I have been eyeing their gluten-free french toast (as seen on Instagram). I think I will need to invite a friend or two to split it with me   I would recommend Jewel's for those needing to avoid gluten and wheat for dietary reasons because it was delicious, and the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. Get there early, because they do run out quick!  PS. They take custom cake orders, so it would be a great place to order a gluten-free cake for a birthday",

What I was imagining versus what I received was different. The portion of my omelette was bit smaller, it was warm at best cheese was already thickened up from cooling down, the potatoes were I would say room temperature and salty, the avocado had dark spots I had to cut out, the orange juice was about 6oz poured from a gallon jug.  The overall flavor was okay however, I can think of other places to get the same if not better flavor for less.   Maybe they shine with the baked items which I did not try but the girl who worked the front was very friendly so I give them 2 stars for the service.",

Regardless, I decided to try Jewel's for breakfast after seeing a friend post a super tasty looking photo of their food. I was also excited that they use many local providers for their ingredients. I had their egg sandwich with the egg cooked over medium (which they weren't sure they could do, but did end up doing). The husband had the biscuits and gravy. The sandwich was.... lackluster. They forgot to put the cheese on it, and when I asked for the cheese, they gave me a cold slice... not exactly the same as having melted cheese on a breakfast sandwich. The sausage on the sandwich was mediocre and the bread was dense... heavy... unpleasant to eat. The sandwich could have benefited from A) different bread or even a wrap or tortilla and B) some vegetables.... who wants to get a sandwich that just has meat and egg on it? It needed something fresh. The biscuits and gravy were the same story.... dense heavy biscuits with mediocre gravy. So why 3 stars? I got their chocolate chip cookie with check in.... I was worried it wasn't going to be great given the meal.... I was SO wrong... this was one of the best cookies of my life! The cookie had to be about 80% chocolate to 20% cookie.... it was so good. I would go back just for that cookie. I can't say I'd go back for the food.",

I had to look around for a couple minutes and actually interrupt a woman ordering at the counter in order to grab a menu, because it isn't posted on the wall.   When I mentioned it was our first time here, the waitress just kind of stared at me - it would have been nice to have been guided through the menu a bit or been offered suggestions such as daily specials or house favorites.   Due to the uniqueness of their GF menu, we'll certainly give it another go.

I wasted my money.  The food did not even come out as I ordered it.  I was so off put by the lack of friendliness that I just wanted to finish up and leave.  This place is not at all what it represents it to be. it is NOT a little neighborhood cafe by any means. The food is overpriced and served in a very odd way--making it totally unappealing. The food is greasy too which was a surprise. More than anything, though, was the uppity attitude of the owner.  Really? I would suggest a little humbleness and a smile and a \"Thank you for coming in\" would go a long way. As for me, I will not give it a second chance and am grateful that I can air my opinions on yelp. BTW: the other employee there was very friendly. Jewel herself is the problem.",

We never saw our initial waiter again after he took our order.  We saw 4 employees in random roles, and all were friendly, pleasant, and gracious.  However, we had to stop any of them to ask about our orders; when my latte came, it was barely warm; my friend never got her coffee refill.  Lunch items were tasty.  I would never go back but for the freedom of ordering \"normal\" dishes that are gluten free.  Please, Jewels, get some organized help!",

I was diagnosed with celiac about six months ago and have been struggling to find food that tastes like food. This please was a awesome fine for me. The food was delicious and there was not one item I had I did not like. Unfortunately when I went back they were closed due to plumbing issues but I hope they open up soon. This place is definitely on my top five list. It is worth the 30 minute drive to get there!",

    "text": "On my last visit, there was an associate who was less then welcoming and had me leaving the bakery just completely rubbed the wrong way, well into the afternoon!   It was a Monday Morning (I know, by far one of the more difficult mornings to get yourself up and at'em) and as I was waiting in line admiring the treats that were out on display, the associate at the counter was assisting the women in front of me as she was picking up an order. Another associate came out from the back, and was hoping to assist me, and I was speaking with him and asked about the cinnamon rolls availability as they were not displayed, the man I was dealing with, politely said \"You know, I'm not sure, let me check in the back for you.\" As he just finished the statement the other associate yelled \"WE DON'T HAVE ANY!\" Alright sir, calm down! Came running to my head after being slightly taken back. Pretty startling to hear coming from someone you are not speaking to and from behind. I can understand he was hoping to save the man helping me some time, but all the same, assist the customer you are with before abruptly chiming in on a conversation. Then when I turned back around to the associate that was supposed to be helping me had walked away to the other room, without as much as recommendation to another item as you were out of the cinnamon rolls! I mean although the cinnamon roll was one of the reasons I went in, I would of course be buying other treats! I stood there and went back to looking at the case to make my other selections. Once the associate finished up with the women picking up, he returned to behind the counter and let me know that there were no more cinnamon rolls as the kitchen had run out of baking soda or was it powder? Whichever it was, it seems a tad silly to run out of such a key baking staple.  We then began to go into my order and he was just the most unhelpful bakery associate I have encountered! It was like pulling teeth to get a recommendation! I get it, eating too much sweets I am sure some dental work is needed, but not when it's someone's JOB is to sell baked goods!  Also when someone inquiries about the reheating of one of your freezer products, best to have your associates well informed of how to advise a customer on doing so and making sound as though it would be just as tasty had it been fresh. I was told to \"leave the donuts out on the counter for 30 mins from them to come up to room temp and that they would taste alright\"...Yea that sounds real appetizing!...As I ran down my list of items that I was going to get he went to bag each one instead of placing them in a pastry box, which once I noticed had to ask him to do so, and he obliged. When he got back and was placing everything in the box he was multitasking and rang me out prompting me to finish the transaction and stop looking away from the screen till it was complete. It seemed as though he just wanted to be done with me and move on, but it's not as if there was anyone in line behind me...so not sure what he was rushing me for. I mean if I want to continue to look and potentially add more to my check that would seem like something that would be promoted! Also not sure if I was over charged for a small cream puff dipped in chocolate as I drove away noticed the receipt said $4.00 for a \"large cream puff\"...My bad for not paying attention and asking.  By far one of the most disagreeable encounters I've had when walking into a bakery with such sweet treats! Please have your associates take a customer service training course! In my opinion if you're getting paid to be a customer facing associate, you had better smile with everything you have, when you talking with one!",

    "text": "PROS: I like the concept of the gluten free restaurant and the baked goods were very tasty. I did get a glance at the owner as she walked by and she seemed very worn out. I would like to go back another day and try some of the actual food like chicken and waffles.  CONS: The moment I walked through the door the place was a mess. Tables were all dirty and so was the floor. Food was everywhere almost like there had been a food fight that just ended. There was a gentleman who appeared to be cleaning but really just moseyed around trying to look busy while gawking at myself and my friend who was also female. It made us feel uncomfortable to say the least. The girl working the register was for the most part helpful and friendly. I caught a glimpse of the back kitchen as workers passed in and out through the swinging door and the kitchen was very dirty, un kept, disorganized etc. My friend and I sat in my car to enjoyed our treat and as workers geared up to leave for the day one of them walked by my car with a completely grimace face almost to be dogging me. I just smiled but no change in attitude. This is the kind of employee who is running the business down.  Summary: Jewel, I believe you have a fabulous idea here but you really need a crew that can hold the atmosphere of the restaurant for you. Someone to manage this place well and from what I saw you just don't have that at this time. Some of the employees are lacking greatly for your restaurant. The baked goods were great but the service and the cleanliness is seriously disappointing.",

I had a few bites and It was amazing. I can't believe that was a gluten free waffle because it tasted sooo good and it was so fluffy and really soaked up the syrup.

Apparently Jewels and their \"grub hub machine is broken and they don't receive online orders\" according to the young lady at the counter. Not a big deal technology sucks, and I was disappointed I didn't get to try their food.   The issue with this establishment is that I was still charged and no remedy or solution was ever attempted. Their customer service sucks. When I asked if they could still make my order I was told it'd be about 20 minutes. There was no rush or even mention of an attempt to get my PAID order through quicker, since I placed 15 minutes prior to my arrival. They weren't able to provide a refund, the onus was on me to to contact yelp. The counter full of pastries stood right in front me and nothing was offered as a replacement. I stood around for maybe 3 minutes while they tried to figure something out. The line was building up behind me and since I'm more considerate to their costumers than Jewels is I left so others could order and politely said I'd just take care of it. A mummer of sorry was the best response I got during my entire interaction.   Avoid at all cost. If something goes wrong they're not problem solvers.",

I ordered breakfast with two sunny side eggs, pancakes and home fries. My husband ordered the waffle and egg sandwich. It took 25 minutes for the food to come. Mine arrived with hard eggs which the waitress pointed out and said they were bringing fresh ones. My pancake strangely was burned on each side and RAW IN THE MIDDLE. She told my husband his would be a few minutes because they burned his waffle. About 5 minutes later his came out with a BURNED WAFFLE. ???? What? She did end up bringing more eggs for me but they were so raw I ate the over cooked ones. It was time to leave and thank god. She apologized but unfortunately we will never be back and I wouldn't waste my time trying it.",

The staff is not very friendly, and it takes a long time for orders to come out. I ordered an iced coffee the other day, and it took over 15 minutes for the staff to put ice in a cup and pour the pre-made cold brew over the top. I was one of two customers in the establishment when this happened. I still have no idea why it took so long.   I've eaten their salads, which are alright, but again, it takes a very long time for the team to prepare a simple cesar.   I wish this place had better customer service and exicution of orders, it's so close to my work that I would love to eat here all the time, but I've yet to have an experience that would make me want to return.  I'm excited to see they are now open for dinner! I hope when I return for a dinner service that my experience will be better.",

    "text": "PSA: If you have celiac disease, you should know whether or not you are sensitive to gluten-free oats before you go here. Jewel's uses (gf) oats in their flour blend, which means if you're an oat-sensitive celiac, your menu options are much more limited. However, there are a handful of oat-free (and vegan) options, and since the entire place is certified gluten-free, I feel safe coming here for a snack and to hang out with a friend or three.  oat-free vegan options: buffalo cauliflower with vegan ranch, sweet potato or white potato fries, garden tacos, garden salad.   be warned that the ingredients listed on the menu aren't inclusive: if you have any other restrictions besides celiac disease, bring it up to the server. for example, the garden tacos don't list that they include tomatoes (this didn't seem unusual with so many other veggies in the tacos), but when they arrived there was definitely tomato, and so my husband got two tacos instead of getting one and sharing the other with me.  the service is REALLY slow. like, painfully slow. not just to take our orders, but to bring out the food (and everyone's food was not brought out at the same time, even though we were the only people eating food from the kitchen at the time). BUT... those buffalo cauliflower bites are pretty delicious though, and kind of worth the wait. (the hot sauce is on the side, and it tastes like plain old frank's red hot, so it's not that exciting, but the panko breading and the vegan ranch dressing are awesome.)  the servers kind of treat you like you have no idea what you're doing. we've been here twice, bringing my parents the second time, and i felt like the servers were acting like we were a handful of tourists who wandered in off the street just looking for random food, rather than a family trying to accommodate their one member who is a super sensitive celiac. the server didn't want to explain what was in the flour blend, either, which was really weird. seems like the'd get that question every day, unless they're mostly catering to the GF fad dieters who don't need to be gluten-free.  the bread (oats and all) was a real hit with my gluten-eating family. my parents are serious gluten junkies, so if they liked it, it must've been good.  I'd actually give this place one star for the oat flour, abbreviated hours, and slow slightly condescending service, but they have a Black man working there (I'm sorry I don't remember your name, sir! you were the only Black man when I was there!) who was truly wonderful. He kept the dining room very clean and said hello to us a couple times. A little girl dropped a takeout cupcake on the floor, popping open the container and losing the cupcake. She started crying and apologizing profusely right away. I'm not usually super excited to share my dining experience with crying children, but I can relate to her utter sorrow: when you've got celiac disease, dropping a fancy (and expensive) treat like that on the floor is suddenly a whole lot sadder and upsetting than when you up-end a pack of Hostess cupcakes onto the sidewalk after school. I always do the mental math to calculate how much money I'm throwing away whenever I drop a cookie on the floor at home, so I was pretty sad for this little girl. It looked like a good (if oaty) cupcake. This quiet hardworking gentleman just brought her another cupcake in a new container without making any kind of fuss over it. I've been to plenty of shops all over the country that probably never would've been that nice.  accessibility: the ramp between the parking and the sidewalk is in disrepair and very narrow, but mostly manageable in a wheelchair. there's space enough for wheelchairs in the restaurant, although it may be a wee bit cramped when they get busy. the bathroom is wide and clean.",

It was not a traditional French Toast with generic sliced bread, but almost a cinnamon roll type consistency that was small and satisfying. And whatever syrup they give you is absolutely the best syrup you've ever tasted. Add in some slightly browned potatoes and nicely cooked bacon, and you've got one of the most satisfying breakfasts I've had in a long time in Phoenix.  Be prepared to wait for your food. It seems like quality is preferred over quickness here. And let's be honest if you're out to breakfast why not enjoy the experience for as long as possible.  The Pumpkin Spiced Latte was excellent as well. Homemade syrup that was flavorful without seeming chemically.   If you're in the area skip LGO and head to Jewel's Bakery instead!",

Gf Ginger molasses cookies, cupcakes, macaroons, gf flour mixes for cookies and cornbread mix. They also do breakfast which is delicious.   On a side note, they rock at cakes too. Last year my husband and I popped in to grab a cake for our wedding party. Our guests had no idea it was gluten free and were saying how delicious it was. I recommend placing a custom order though and not being spontaneous like us!",

They make their own bread here, $8 a loaf, a bit steep, but you pay for freshness and quality. I think a good time to buy goodies is probably in the afternoon, you can buy them at a discounted price. I'd like to try their pretzels, they look so good, but you have to pre-order them. Will i go back? Im sure i will, i want to like it. It's Gluten Free and i want to support that.",

They serve them with this hot sauce/butter/sugar mix that is yum!   I don't have a gluten-free diet but everything I've tried was really good, I couldn't tell anything was missing.   The service is pretty sucky, hence the 3 stars. I can't really gauge if the staff is rude or just awkward, either way it's not the most pleasant experience. The last time I was there, a gal came up to our table and said \"are you finished with that?\" and pulled my plate away before I answered. It still had food on it and I had my fork in my hand en route to my mouth! Haha. And we couldn't have been sitting more than 10 minutes so it's not like we were \"camping\" and she was politely telling us to move along.   I will be back because the food is good but I will take-out. I don't think I will eat in again. They're not the friendliest of people.",

She sells bags of her flour,  pancake mix, brownie mix and more to take home, very cool! It has been only open for breakfast and lunch but now expanding to Thur, Fri and Sat night for dinner.

I used to walk in excited to see what sort of creation I could find, especially in their reduced price freezer they don't have anymore. No more donuts except on days they 'tell you on Facebook' but somehow never see. I used to love their flatbreads and breakfast sandwhich but they have changed their menu so many times, and now a lot of it are things you can easily get at another restaurant, like bowls and pancakes. I got excited awhile ago seeing biscuits and gravy, but the biscuit is not buttery at all, and the sausage gravy, as well, does not have much flavor. I kinda HAVE to go there though because of the gluten free aspect, but it has lost a lot of its appeal",

We pull in parking lot at 1:20pm and a girl sticks her head out door and says they are closed. Don't advertise that you are open \"holiday hours\" if you aren't willing to serve. Most likely will never make the trek up from San Tan Valley to try this restaurant ever again. Poor business practices.",

Any time I'm in the area, regardless of the time of day (assuming it is open), I'll be back for a waffle and that very addictive drug posing as syrup.",

Their entire menu and bakery is gluten free, and is really great taste and price wise. Today my husband had the chicken and waffles which were awesome- the breading on the chicken is crunchy and seasoned to perfection, but the real treat is the spicy dipping sauce- amazing! I had the hot chicken sandwich and the chicken and bun were amazing, fries were 'meh' (not crispy), and the sunny side up egg on the sandwich was undercooked (the whites were still translucent, not opaque and there was a mystery blue line on it). However the sandwich was still delicious even when I just took the egg off. I would have given Jewels 5 stars even with the egg if there had been a chance to correct it but unfortunately we didn't see our waitress again until she brought us the check. I still enjoy this place and will be back! If next time goes well I'll definitely update with a 5 star review.",

    "text": "If I could leave a negative star for my dining experience here today I would. I was so excited to try this place based off all of their instagram photos and the fact that they're a gluten free establishment that serves foods I normally wouldn't be able to enjoy unless I prepared it myself. With that said the excitement was very real. We arrived a little after noon and were told it would be a wait of 30 minutes or longer which was to be expected on a Sunday. We were able to get seated 45 minutes later. We ordered our food as soon as our server asked us about drinks. Our food arrived at our table 45 minutes after placing the order. We watched several people who came in after us receive their food first but didn't make a big deal out of it. We were certain the chicken and waffles would be worth the wait. The wait was finally over and we dug in. Our waffles were still wet and undercooked. I had to get up and find the server to let him know because no servers came by to do a quality check. He offered to bring us a new waffle and the new waffle was the exact same as the previous one so it sat there. Now on to the chicken. The breading was the perfect consistency and it came out super hot which is great, however, it disappointed in flavor and lacked seasoning. I was only able to eat one of the three chicken tenders and it was only out of pure hunger. We sat there for an additional ten minutes. Throughout our dining experience we saw several other patrons who were frustrated due to not getting their check and some finally got up and walked over to the pos system to pay. Others were frustrated due to the very long wait. While talking to the diners behind us, they said this was the first time they'd had poor service and were just as dissatisfied. We finally approached our server at the pos while he was closing out a check and let him know that we would be leaving due to the poor service and underwhelming food. He said \"I know we gave you bad service today and I can't argue with you about that.\" He was very understanding but there was hardly any apology or solution given to incentivize us to come back. I served at one of DTPHX's most popular restaurants. Quality checks were mandatory within minutes of observing our patrons take their first bites. If a customer was dissatisfied we'd immediately apologize and offer to remake it and remove it from their bill. If that wasn't satisfactory we'd give them coupons for a discount on their next bill, free drinks or free dessert. Hell sometimes we'd give them several coupons. Regardless of whether the offer would be accepted we'd try our best to accommodate them for the inconvenience. Dirty plates never sat on the table for long and we dropped checks as soon as their plates were collected. I observed none of this at Jewel's today. I think the concept at Jewel's is great but the execution is severely lacking. I saw no FOH manager floating around and it seemed like the servers were just running around with no real order or direction. The restaurant itself also wasn't up to my high standards. There are holes in the ladies bathroom walls, an empty to go container sat outside on the patio floor the whole time we were there and the floor and tables weren't clean to the standard I would expect for any restaurant. Perhaps my expectations are too high having had worked in restaurants before but I'm sorry Jewel's you guys really missed the mark for us today. My suggestion would be to coach servers on how to be more communicative and transparent when there are longer ticket times, bump up the efficiency by streamlining service better (full hands out and full hands in so tables get cleared faster), be more attentive to patrons and do quality checks. Also having a FOH manager present would certainly help too, especially for handling dissatisfied customers. Like I said, I really like the idea and I think this place has a lot of potential, maybe today was just an off day, an anomaly if you will. I'd like to say I'd give them another chance but I think that would be a lie.",

I called earlier in the week to make reservations for my group which included 7 out of town guests. It was supposed to be a special brunch celebrating our out of town guests and also a goodbye brunch for a friend. A few people in our party  arrived and were told that the restaurant was not seating anyone right now even though we had a reservation.  After that was communicated to us they then told us our reservation was taken by another group. They couldn't guarantee a time frame for our party to be seated and no intentions of accommodating us. It was very difficult to relocate my party of 14 on Sunday because of this restaurant's blunder. Overall I was very disappointed with the lack of customer service.",

Each sandwich came on a different gluten free roll that were equally tasty, the chicken was super juicy, the portobello was roasted with just the right amount of tang, and everything was definitely homemade.   We were too full to try any of the baked goods, which include awesome-looking cupcakes, sticky buns, scones & cookies. But I will definitely be back to try those gluten free creations, as well as their quiche for breakfast/brunch.  All the staff was super friendly and efficient. As we settled into the cozy cafe, Julie, the Jewel's behind the cafe's name, stopped by to check on us! You can't get better than that!  Possibly the best part, as we left, my boyfriend who suffers from a gluten allergy, smiled and said he didn't feel any discomfort at all. A sandwich any where else normally means lots of heartburn medicine. We are thrilled to have found Jewel's Bakery & Cafe and can't wait to go back!",

I usually have to involve the chef or manager to ask about cross contamination or how something is prepared.  At Jewel's?  The work is all done for me!  Where else can you get organic, gluten free options like build your own burger, Chicken and Waffles, Pancakes, Grilled Cheese, brownies, Cartel Coffee and more?  The daily specials are scrumptious and keep me coming back time and again.  I have been a customer of Julie's since she baked out of her house and I am so happy to see this great place appealing to so many gluten free diners as well as people who have no idea this is a totally gluten free environment.  Her food is just that good!  I buy my bread there as well.  The flaxbread I can have freshly sliced and it tastes amazing!  It's so good that my daughter requests it and she's not even gluten free!  Cookies and scones are terrific as well and this is my GO TO birthday cake and cupcake store as well.  I had a Monte Cristo donut for National Donut Day that knocked my socks off!  It was nitrate free ham with brie cheese and a cherry sauce in a powdered sugar donut.  Yea, baby!",

My husband and I ate there a few weeks ago for lunch on a Sunday. I had the rice bowl, my husband had the gravy dish. Mine was O.K.,  but his was luke warm. Several weeks passed, we thought we'd give it another try, thinking it might have been an off day before. Our second experience was worse than the first. It was busy but about 2/3 full, we waited along time before ordering. My husband asked for a cup of coffee....never came, he had to finally go and find someone to get it. Our food took a long time to come, my grilled Turkey Stack was not crispy, had limp lettuce and was room temp. The fries were also room temp and stuck together. My husband had the Omelet, he asked for silverware, I asked for ketchup.....waited......never came, he finally got up to find some himself. No one ever came by to ask if things were good.  I really wanted to like this place, but it's off of our list.",

I called to see if someone had picked it up but the owner had said she did not hear of anything. I then went down to the restaurant and talked to the waiter who serves us and said he didn't see a wallet but took my number down.   I then went to the barbershop next door thinking I maybe dropped it in the parking lot. The kind barber said he saw me eating their earlier and told the waiter that I had left a wallet on the table. (The same employee who I questioned). The barber went over the with me to confront the guy who then admitted to his owner that he took it off the table and left it in his apron but it was gone.   Turns out the employee took it home but when I threatened I would have the police come he magically went home and said he accidentally switched aprons and now my wallet appeared. Too bad I'm afraid he copied my credit cards numbers down and had to cancel everyone of them.   I worked in the restaurant industry for many year and I would never think of doing this to someone. The owner was very cooperative and helped resolve the situation quickly.  I hate to always blame an establishment for one bad egg, but it left a sour taste in my mouth this time.  I hope in the future I  can return there with different results!",

After telling her our entire order, she forgot everything we said and had to repeat it. Then, she asked for clarification on something. As we answered her, she got sidetracked in another conversation and we had to repeat what we said again. She kept complaining about how distracted she was and \"didn't know what was going on in this world\". Ordering took 2x longer than it should have.   We proceeded to find a table and were excited for our meal. After waiting about half an hour, we asked for an update on our food. The cooks told us they were just starting it and had a \"large backup\" even though the restaurant was relatively slow.   After waiting 10 more minutes for our food, our breakfast tacos finally arrived. Except, they were just omelettes. Nothing \"taco\" about it. We could've gone anywhere for omelettes.   We asked a waitress for a manager, who never showed up.   We finally got up and found the manager ourselves. The manager was understanding, but spoke in a confrontational way and pretty much said \"I know there is a problem, but deal with it. The last customer waited 50 minutes for their food, so your wait wasn't even that long.\"  All in all, we won't be back. Ditsy, clueless cashiers; insane wait time; inaccurate menu descriptions, uncaring owner.",

I got the bacon waffle over easy egg sandwich with hollandaise special. The eggs were fried (no runny yolk) and my first round of hollandaise came out scrambled and hard.  It took about 20 minutes to get a new side of it. When that came out it was completely curdled. I know how to make hollandaise and I was so sad.i pow hollandaise so much.  I ended up just eating the eggs and side potatoes because the waffle was so bland and the hollandaise sucked. The maple syrup was hard also and tasted like lame butterscotch. Our service was so slow, but she did comp us for the mess up and for waiting so long and she did this without us having to complain. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles and the chicken was good but the batter was sooo bland. We also sat in the corner with flies swarming us the whole time. It was beyond annoying and gross. I truly think today was an off day and I think we'll come back and try it again but today sucked.",

They put a spin on theirs with corn bread biscuits and Sage gravy.  I'm not one to try new things easy, but thought let's explore a little.  Well, my first bite was interesting-  next was - WHERE is the flavor . I picked up my menu again and noticed my mistake -   They didn't mention sausage in the gravy- it was just a Sage Gravy!   So I gave myself a one star for not reading to closely, but they get a one star for ruining a great menu item,  and the menu made it sound like it runs out fast-  maybe it's me,  but I found it tasteless and dry. The potatoes were not seasoned at all. The eggs were fluffy, but were cold. I'm thinking they had the items ready and not cooked to order. I got my order literally 3 minutes after I placed it.  The best part of my meal was the milk, except it came in a mason jar -  The service was fast, the waitress was nice, but it lacked the bakery feel, smell, and taste.",

    "text": "This place is incredible! Not only do they have lots of gluten-free and vegan options, but they're actually delicious. I tried the waffle breakfast sandwich and it was bursting with flavor. It included eggs, bacon, sausage and lots of melty havarti cheese, all sandwiched between two waffles, and it comes with a delicious caramel-like buttermilk syrup that is to die for. It also comes with \"pots,\" which are their house potatoes and I don't know what it is about them but they are amazing? I truly am still in shock from this place. I want to go everyday. I also got a chocolate chip scone and a salted caramel brownie for later. They serve Press Coffee which is a yummy local favorite. Additionally, the inside is super cute and they have a nice patio for nice weather. The staff was very friendly and personable and the food came out quickly. Seriously you need to come here! #lfthx",

I had biscuits and gravy with eggs and home Fries. The gravy was peppery and thick and full of sausage and bacon. The biscuits were tender and flaky. The eggs were done perfectly. The home fries were fresh and hot. Yum!",

For some reason, they felt it would make sense to bring the eggs that were supposed to be with the biscuits separately.  Waited another 30 minutes, no food.  I look around and see that others have gotten their biscuits and gravy that came way after us.  I asked them to cancel our food order and yet they still charged me for the cold eggs which we left on the food.  Terrible.  Avoid like the plaque.",

I was asking questions to the cashier (by the way she didn't smile at all), she had to ask a question to the manager. The manager was super rude! I can't believe they treat customers like that! The cashier said my sandwich was going to take 10 minutes. Guess what?! It took longer cause they made a mistake with my order. The cashier brought me the sandwich when it was ready. She didn't say thank you. They don't know anything about customer service! My fries were very salty!   I have been here twice and have had very bad impression about their service both times!",

I dragged my brother with me (cause he has a sweet tooth too), and we soon found ourselves staring at the bakery case. Unfortunately, what we expected to be a tough decision due to too many options was really quite an easy one...we didn't order a thing. That's right, not one thing...for multiple reasons: 1. There was no one in the bakery (bad sign) 2. No one came to help us  3. The case was dirty 4. There were only a few baked goodies in the case and none of them looked appetizing or worth the calories.  We were both shocked and disappointed to leave empty handed. When an eatery claims to be a \"bakery\" I expect to at least have the desire to try one thing in their case, but nothing looked good. Next time I'll take my sweet tooth to LGO, essence, or AJs.",

For a lot of important people at the wedding, including the maid of honor, gluten-free was mandatory because of Celiac allergy.  On the wedding day, no cake delivered, and there is no communication from Jewels or answers to calls. Father of bride had to leave the wedding to find a cake. We had to cut a cake from the grocery store, and family members were not able to eat it. The cake portion of the wedding was ruined. Brides parents were stressed calling Jewels and figuring out an alternative. We will always remember the wedding cake fiasco from that special day. Jewels took a special moment from us.",

I went for Easter brunch at 2:00 there were about 5 tables left so it wasn't even crowded. We sat there waiting for our biscuits while we watched our server eat them in the back for 10 minutes before we got ours. When she dropped the food off, she never came back to ask how it was. My waffles were completely raw inside. Unfortunately this is the 4th time in a row I've been served raw waffles or donuts there. This time I got extremely sick from them. I contacted them on Instagram with no response. I'm disappointed to see a place I used to love so much go downhill so fast.",

It was the perfect portion and just amount of flavor. Everything in the bowl was delicious! My bf ordered the basic breakfast and the pancakes were so good I almost wanted to order just that on the side after my bowl lol but opted for a dairy-free brownie which after it sat out a few minutes was super rich and soft and you couldn't tell the difference! I definitely will have to try breakfast next time!! #lfthx",

Today is my husbands birthday so I called and placed a custom order for a dozen vanilla cake pops with white chocolate coating.  Unfortunately, there was a miscommunication somewhere and I ended up with chocolate cake pops with chocolate frosting. Not ok especially since neither my husband nor I care for chocolate at all. Total ruin for his birthday; however when I called to discuss this with the bakery, they were very kind and even offered to redo the order and bring it to us. If we hadn't had plans for the rest of the day, I would've taken that opportunity. That was a very wonderful thing for them to offer and I appreciate it.  Fortunately, I bought two vanilla cupcakes while there and the cupcakes will be my husbands birthday cake. Not ideal but it's the best I've got right now.  I will probably try them again solely bc of the great customer service I received but won't do a custom order for awhile. I think they're worth a try.",

The workers are all really sweet, and the brunch is pretty freakin' good!  I had the chilaquiles, and they were superb, even to-go. The husband had the bisquits and gravy with chorizo. He wasn't over-wowed by them, but said he'd go back.   We tried a couple of their baked goods: the lemon-blueberry scone was alright. The maple-bacon cinnamon roll is a good idea... but could use some work. Our roll was mostly... well, roll. It needs more glaze, and more filling - it was so bready that it was hard to tell that there was any bacon involved. The winner for us was the blueberry loaf. That was pretty awesome (and I'm a pretty good home baker, so... I don't do baked good compliments often).   I returned later in the week for lunch, and had the Red Chile Chicken salad - it was really good! I wish it was a bigger portion, and I wish it was tossed a little better - all the good stuff was at the bottom and I didn't realize it until I had eaten almost all the greens!!!   The \"Cafe\" part of the name is kinda misleading - I thought I'd be able to get a latte there. They have Cartel coffee, but no espresso drinks.

Vintage/ Shabby Chic is the closest thing I can think to call it, but it's not so frilly that a guy would feel out of place. Some of the art was done by a local artist and overall it was bright, airy and very, very clean. The staff is AWESOME!!! If I could underline that twice I would, so I'll just say it again..The staff is AWESOME!!!  We ordered the Greek Chicken Salad, the BLT, and Roasted Veggie Flatbread and they were all equally delicious! They forgot to remove an ingredient on my son's sandwich and not only did they apologize and bring us a new sandwhich, they also offered us a complimentary treat for the \"trouble\"!  Now, these treats are the real reason to drive across town because their cupcakes and brownies are good even by gluten standards! I had the Caramel Macchiato Cupcake and it was delicious but then you can't go wrong with the salted caramel brownies either!  The loose leaf mango orange green tea was just another great component to a very wonderful meal.   We'll be back for sure!",

I was not prepared for the plain yogurt so that was an unpleasant surprise but once I added a packet of Stevia it was very good. I also had a side of bacon. This was not good for me but only because I enjoy center cut (more meat and less fat) and these were the exact opposite! I don't think there was but a sliver of meat on either piece! So I ended up not eating very much of them and at $3 for two pieces, I was not overly happy about that.   Breakfast Taco This was my husband's selection. My husband said that while his choice did not look too appetizing at first,  it did taste good. He really enjoyed the green salsa. Home potatoes were good and flavored well.",

    "text": "Was excited to check this place out based on the reviews...maybe I have a different idea of what good food is because this was some of the worst food I've ever had at a restaurant. It was pretty much inedible. I got the blueberry pancake stack with a side of sausage snd a latte. The \"sausage\" was a homemade patty of ground beef with raisins and other random crap in it. It's was cooked to the point of being pulverized. The pancakes on the other hand were undercooked and gummy tasting and that buttermilk syrup was disgusting. The latte was the only good thing I had there and the pastries in the case looked good. I hate ragging on mom and pop businesses but this was a total fail and waste of money. I will admit that I am not on the gluten free bandwagon but I do know there are plenty of ways to make it taste good, this was not one of them.",

I ordered the Greek Chicken Salad Sandwich (delicious), she had the BLT and we shared the blue cheese buffalo chips.  Seriously, make this your new spot.  They are dedicated to being gluten- free (which isn't a dietary restriction for me, but hey, the food is so good!) and will take very good care of you.  Fast- casual atmosphere.

I'm not a regular gluten-free eater and wasn't even aware that it was their \"edge\" until after I'd demolished their breakfast platter, which included a great pancake with some of the best syrup I've ever had. However, the staff was pretty terrible. The cashier was apathetic and rude, to the point where I felt uncomfortable. The chef made his way around the restaurant asking people about their meals but ignored our table completely. I'm pretty bewildered by this, but my best guess is because we're in our young twenties. But the joke is on you Chef Brad, because I'm writing my first ever yelp review about your poor service. I might be back because the food was so good and reasonably priced, but I'm really put off by my service experience. I'd recommend take out, if you're willing to offer your patronage.",

    "text": "Be sure to find this Diamond in the Rough!  Jewel's Bakery is popping out some amazing gluten free food.  That is why this is the diamond in the rough.  It is super hard to find food that is gluten free that taste like its not gluten free.  Not only does Jewel's serve gluten free their whole menu is gluten free.  You cannot find that anywhere, or at least I have not come across that and I travel the country every week.  This trendy modern neighborhood cafe can throw down with the best of them.    If you have the word bakery in the name you better have some great baked goods.  Which Jewel's delivers.  They have a great pastry selection that is gluten free and each pastry is fresh, flavorful, and has more selection than your normal bakery.  When we visited Jewel's this is what we recommend, but by all means you cannot go wrong with anything on their menu:  Donuts - Right off that bat you cannot tell that any of these donuts are gluten free.  I actually had to double check with the waitress to make sure.  Mint Chocolate Chip - The donut itself was chewy, and fluffy.  There was a light mint flavor with the chocolate flavor in the back end.  This was a very delicious donut.  The Mint flavor did not over power the donut which is spot on!  Strawberry Shortcake - Same thing.  The donut was chewy, fluffy and could not tell it is gluten free.  From the first bite there was a good strawberry flavor, the sugary crumble adds a nice little crunch, with hint of vanilla flare.  This donut was interesting because the  strawberry flavor takes you back down memory lane.  I could not put my finger on it but I have tasted this flavor before which was a warm welcome to my child hood!  Orange Drumstick - Best gluten free donut I have ever had!  This donut punched you in the mouth!  The nice subtle hint of orange which does not over power the donut and marries well with the white chocolate pieces on top on the back end. VERY soft, chewy inside.  Muffin and Scone  Banana Nut - This muffin was very moist, soft, and chewy.  This reminds me of moms homemade banana walnut bread taste.  You like banana nut bread, just think if that but gluten free!    Chocolate Chip Scone - This scone is for you my chocolate lovers that needs their daily chocolate fix.  This scone has a nice crust on the outside with the nice warm soft chewy inside with big chocolate flavor on the back end.   Breakfast Entrees  Chorizo Breakfast Bowl - This bowl is made with potato, two eggs, cheddar, onion, red pepper, Chorizo, and Chipotle Aioli. This bowl is for you savory people that want a little heat in the morning.  This bowl is very pleasing to the eye and will take you down to flavor town.  This bowl is not also flavorful but has layers of texture for that perfect bowl.  You get the layers of texture with crispness of potato, heat from Chorizo, and fluffiness of eggs topped with Chipotle Aoli and salsa.   Biscuits & Gravy (Favorite) - This entree has sage sausage gravy, fresh baked gluten free biscuits, potatoes, bacon with chicken sausage and eggs.  With first bite you get the flavor in thick, chunky, rich, flavorful, creamy gravy.  Then you get the gravy flavor which gets soaked up into the biscuit for the full flavor at each level.  This dish is served with perfectly seasoned crispy potatoes and nice fluffy eggs.  The gravy is what makes this entree and complements everything nicely.    Chicken & Waffles -  This entree is a money maker.  You get 3 strips of fried chicken with 4 quarter sized waffles served with honey sriracha, and buttermilk syrup.  The chicken has a crispy outside, flavorful batter with nice tender, juicy white meat chicken on the inside.  The waffles were nice, fluffy, chewy and marries well with the chicken for that texture punch to the face.  The waffle soaks up the 2 sauces combined with the chicken make for the a unique perfect bite.  Waffle Breakfast Sandwich - This has Schreiner's sausage, eggs, cheddar, potatoes, and syrup.  The first bite you get the fluffy savory waffle that complements nicely with the juicy chicken sausage (you can see the herbs and spices in the sausage), and the eggs and cheddar on the back end of the bite.  If you want to add another level of flavor you can add a little maple syrup to complete this amazing breakfast sandwich.  Gluten intolerant or not ride your magic carpet down and find this magical Jewel in Phoenix.  BrandonFitFoodie",

This is without a doubt the best chicken and waffles I've had in AZ and is one of the top chicken and waffles and Nashville Hot Chicken I've had anywhere. You NEED to come try it if you're a fan of hot chicken and/or chicken and waffles (they have normal chicken and waffles for those that don't like the heat)",

These aren't easy to make, let alone perfect but Jewels has it on lock. The apple crumb cake was divine as well. Nice and moist and you can tell its homemade. I'll definitely come back earlier to try other things!",

We were greeted as soon as we walked in and our waitress was very attentive and helpful the whole time we were there. We ordered the cheese curds to start and then I ordered the chicken strips basket (I'm a celiac) and my boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles (he has no dietary restrictions). The cheese curds were nice and very ooey gooey. The chicken was really good with a nice, thick crispy batter to it. Since being diagnosed, I have struggled to find a place with really good, crispy chicken tenders (except for a particular food truck) so I am thrilled that I now know where I can go when I have a craving. The waffles were excellent as well. Very fluffy and moist with a nice texture. Had my boyfriend not been told it was gluten-free he never would've been able to tell just by eating it. Also, their honey maple syrup is oh so good! We also bought a few desserts to go and, at the suggestion of our server, I got the creme brulee macaron. I was also mesmerized by how pretty the blueberry lemon cheesecake looked so I had to get that, too. I wanted to try the cereal thriller blondie but another customer beat me to the last one. Oh well there's always next time. But let me tell you about the ones I did get. The creme brulee macaron was so good. It had a nice sweet flavor and was light and airy. Great recommendation! The cheesecake...oh my...that was like heaven on my fork. Not only was it beautiful (sorry, I ate it before I thought to snap a picture), the taste was amazing! Easily the best cheesecake I've had in a long time. Had I known it was going to be that good, I would've bought the whole cake! There's always next time. ;-) I was also pleasantly surprised with the prices of the desserts.   Overall, great food, great service. It is so nice to have a place with a tasty selection that I know is safe for me to eat. It takes the stress out of dining out. I will definitely be back. Thank you for this gem!",

    "text": "I've been going to Jewels for a while now. My husband and I made reservations to treat his parents and my mother to brunch yesterday for Mother's Day. We had previously taken my mom out to Jewels for the past 2 mother's days. I hate to say it, this time was a huge mistake.   Another reviewer mentioned \"Mother's Day Chaos\", and this described our experience perfectly. We ordered 2 appetizers, chips and churros, along with entrees for all of us. It took quite some time for the apps to come out, but we figured they were busy and we'd just deal with it. The chips came out and we had to ask for our churros again in order to get those. When we got them, the order wasn't complete (we were missing one). We were just happy to have food at that point.  About an hour after we arrived, everyone got their food - except me. It wasn't until everyone was almost done with their food that I finally got my order, after telling 2 people that we were still waiting for it. I'm 7 months pregnant, getting cranky, and my entire family is offering me their sides just so I could have something to eat since I was getting shaky. My father in law asked for a refill on his drink and we got it as he was finishing his meal. I will also mention, that the people next to us were seated some time after us, got their food before us, got their cupcakes, paid, and left - all before we did. This might be stupid, but my in laws drove from Prescott for this, and my mother in law had told me she was excited to try one of the cupcakes... we never got any. I wanted to order some, but it was so crazy that we just ended up leaving.   I'm just disappointed because I wanted this to be a nice day for my mom and my mother in law (and myself, since this is kind of my first Mother's Day, being super pregnant and all) and it honestly just sucked. I think it was just overbooked and that could have been avoided.   Overall - decent food, great pastries, however I will forever avoid events there from now on.",

    "text": "I lived in Arizona for close to two years and passed by Jewel's multiple times a week without ever stopping in. A year after moving to a different state, I finally made my way into this Gluten Free Bakery. After being on a GF diet for the last 5 years, I've tasted it all. Jewel's is one of the best GF bakeries out there. The food is delicious and the pricing isn't bad compared to the quality of food that you get!   On my first visit I ordered the Chicken and Waffles plate- the waffle was just right, crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle, and the buttermilk syrup is out of this world! The chicken was well seasoned and nicely fried (a dream for those of us that grew up eating fried chicken on the regular) I would have wanted at least one more strip of chicken though (or five). My friend, who isn't gluten free ordered the biscuits and gravy and she was amazed that it was gluten free! I tried a bite and it was just as I remembered.  On my second visit ( the next day- since I was on vacation) I ordered a slice of quiche. It was good sized quiche, definitely larger than I was expecting since with GF foods you often receive smaller portions.   For my drive home I grabbed ( and paid for) a lemon bar (absolutely delicious and massive), two cupcakes (yummy) and 3 cinnamon rolls. Now to the cinnamon rolls- these cinnamon rolls are what every GF eating person has been searching for! The dough is buttery and flakey, terms that are not always associated with GF foods, and the frosting is finger licking good! If you get the chance to stop by this bakery and can only order one item I would recommend the Cinnamon Roll! It's been 3 months since this visit and I am still trying to find a way to go back for more or have friends ship me some!! Traveling tip- I froze all my items and put them in an insulated bag for my 8 hr trip home and they kept very well.",

No signs of the scone at all, which I would say has a considerably different texture/consistency than a waffle. I also got the pistachio donut. Also extremely disappointing. It was really really dense and doughy almost (and I like dense donuts) and then just tasted like it was dripping in oil with too sweet of frosting on top. Not sure if I'll give the place another shot...",

The woman who helped us was super honest, funny and real. I believe her name was Adriana and she made the cost way better.   The place was packed, so it was defiantly a popular place. If we could get you to open one in our town in San Diego that would be great. From a visitor to az, thanks.",

The bakery case is heaven. This is a fave for my gluten free and gluten loving friends alike.  They just added a hostess which helps differentiate those there to eat and those there to pick up bakery or frozen items and generally just makes the whole experience better all around.   The patio is small but dog friendly, which is great.   Jewel's is also a supporter of local small businesses, which I love (who doesn't love Cartel coffee).",

    "text": "First visit I waited 30 minutes for a cup of coffee, had to ask twice for water. A couple at another table waited so long for a server to take their order, they finally gave up, ordered some cupcakes at the counter and left. My food was good, bought some cupcakes to take with me, they were delicious. Was really disappointed in the service but once our order was in, the kitchen was pretty quick, so we chalked it up to a bad day. Service was friendly, just slow, understaffed.  Went back this weekend, hostess warns us that the service might be slow. Not \"we had 2 servers call in sick so we're a little short-staffed today.\" We asked what that meant and she just mumbled again about being slow and didn't really articulate herself. There was a couple of larger groups but a few open tables and no one on the patio. We decided to sit and the hostess went over and asked a server to come by our table, that was nice but if that's not the standard deal - a server coming by pretty soon after sitting down - yikes. Server was really friendly, took our oder (we put food in right away) but she never brought water even though she asked if we wanted any, after being there 20 minutes and well after we had coffee, I finally got up and helped myself to the disposable cups. Food took 45 minutes. We regretted not grabbing tacos and moving on with our Sunday afternoon.  Being the celiac in the family, it sucks to ask people to go to the ONE place you can eat super safe and always get bad service and have it be a poor experience for them. They give two shits it's gluten-free, to them it's the cafe that's always slow (and apparently it's so bad the hostess tries to warn you).  I'll go back only when I'm by myself, I have my computer and can spend an hour and a half getting lunch. Or, will pop in for baked goods at the counter. Why not have enough servers to cover the tables you have? I guess they have a captive, niche audience.",

I was still able to find good seating since I was dining alone. The person serving me was incredibly nice but it was a little hard to get his attention once I was ready for the check. I ordered the chorizo omelet with hash browns, both of which were great. The house salsa went along wonderfully with the hash browns. I got a (vegan or gluten free, or both, can't remember?) peanut butter cookie as well which wasn't bad, but definitely not at the top of my list as far as cookies go. I would love to come back and try their pancakes or waffles, overall it was a good visit.",

The veggie tacos are really good, too. I've ordered the Hot Chick a couple times and it's always on point.   Two out three times we've come, our service has been lacking. The first time it was suggested to us that we order ahead, since our main complaint was how long it took to order and then get our food. We did this the second time we came and everything was perfect....but our trip today was disappointing.  We ordered ahead again. When we arrived Santa was on site & the staff was taking a picture with him.  (As we were sitting there we saw they had posted this Santa thing as an event they sold tickets to, and it ended right as we got there. If we were told when we preordered 20 minutes before, we could have changed our lunch to a more convenient time for the staff).  We sat to wait and they finished up, and then...nothing..it took another 5 or so minutes (maybe longer) for anyone to come check on us (we were sitting in a table right in front of the baker line, too). When we did finally get someone to notice us, we let him know we had ordered ahead, but wanted waters for the table. We didn't see him again for awhile...then he came to drop off half of the tables food, no waters..no silverware...no napkins..   We did end up enjoying our food (as usual) and we might even go back...but we've already decided to order stuff that doesn't need to be hot, get it to go & eat somewhere else. If we actually go back.",

They recently changed what used to be a QSR type restaurant to a \"sit down and have a waitress serve and expect a tip\" type place unless you dine out. It does seem the time it takes for your food to come out is longer than any other place I've been too. Also, if you are only \"ordering out\" you cannot sit at a table to wait, you must stand awkwardly in the corner waiting for your food to come out eventually. The homemade gluten free bread and deserts are amazing though.",

We got our food & all 5 of us in our party barely ate. I had chicken & waffles, the waffles were still gooey in the middle & the chicken had zero flavor & was overcooked. I'm assuming the owner (as she had been behind the counter on the phone previously) came by to clear our plates & didn't comment on the 5 plates of barely eaten food. My mom mentioned how disappointed we were & she basically just brushed us off & walked off. This was NOT a cheap brunch at all. Such a disappointment. We will not be back.",

    "text": "I have been coming here for several years. I guess when things are good, it's easy to take an old favorite for-granted. I used to LOVE this place and would easily have given it 5 stars. Service was always friendly, the vibe was relaxed and cool, dining area was clean, and the food YUMMY! But the past few months something has happened. I come here about once a month and have seen a steady decline. Talking with other GFers, they have noticed the same thing. It's such a shame - because a place like this, for those of us with Celiac or Gluten intolerance, that still love good food, is desperately needed!!   I went in yesterday, and it was the straw that broke the camels back. It was after the lunch rush (about 2:30) but there was lots of staff in the back, so service should have been spot on. No one seemed happy to be there and they showed it. The counters all looked cluttered and dirty. The bakery area was quite empty with few choices (maybe just bad timing). I was just coming in to grab several treats, a loaf of bread, and a coffee, so not sitting to eat this time. That was probably a good thing, because by the looks of things, I'm not sure I would have been happy. The gals behind the counter, weren't just not friendly, but made me feel like I was interrupting them! Another customer came up while I was waiting, and had a problem with her order. I couldn't believe how unhelpful they were to her. If that had been her first time there, I'm guessing she won't be returning.   Anyway, I'm going to stop coming here for a while and see if they can get it together. Hoping the owner reads this. I know two other families that feel the exact same way and have stopped going all-together. Word spreads quick. This place needs a THOROUGH cleaning and some front of the house training. That relaxed, friendly vibe and good food was the draw for years. It's missing now. I hear they are getting a new chef, so hoping he can spruce things up in the back of the house. I did love my goodies I got yesterday - so I did leave with a small smile on my face. .=)   I beg of you, from those of us who just can't eat Gluten, to please get your standards back to where they used to be. I don't think these simple fixes would cost a lot and would be huge for your customers!",

After tearing our house apart and the vehicle we drove there we went back to the restaurant to check if the guy was back from BREAK... This man said no he didn't find a wallet and took our number down and said he would call if it turns up.  We then decided to check one last time in the parking lot and the stores next to jewels and two men from a store next door was eating on the patio the same time we were and said they saw that we left the wallet on the table and gave it to the employee WHO SAID HE DID NOT find a lost Wallet.  he straight up lied to our faces.... This is very disappointing considering both my fiance and I have worked in restaurant and bar industry for many years and would never even think of stealing someone's belongings  Sincerely,  A VERY DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER",

I also tried the biscuit (really had that biscuity goodness to it) and pancakes- yummy but I'm glad I got the quiche as that was just. so. fantastic.   And- they were doing coffee via pour-over and chemex. Can't get a more perfect morning!   Strongly recommend! The fact that everything was gluten-free? Beyond amazing.

EVERYTHING IS!! :)  to a girl who needs to avoid gluten due to a thyroid condition - Jewel's is a dream!  Their cookies are great, they have a few to choose from. I've had their cupcakes (no one would ever know the difference!), brownies I've tried both the regular and salted caramel- yum! I've tried their donuts and while the texture isn't exactly like a gluten-filled donut, I'll take it!! It has great chocolate glaze on it. Their waffles are very golden and crispy and the syrup/butter sauce that comes with them is what makes the dish. I get potatoes and eggs almost every time I go.y favorite things to get at Jewel's are the flax bread (have them slice a loaf and freeze it to keep - if it'll last that long!!) and the MAGIC BARS! Just get there early because the magic bars will sell out! They also sell GF cookie and bread mixes, as well as frozen items for a little cheaper. Cute little outside patio for nice days and my boyfriend loves the coffee and some breakfast items (he's not GF but still loves it here).  Bottom line is, if you are a human who enjoys good food from a cute, hip bakery, go to Jewel's! Service is fabulous, patient and always cheery & helpful!!",

There have been many times that I have said to myself \"there is no way everything is gluten free\" but it is. Do yourself a favor and check it out. We also love the kale chips in the potatoes. I do wish they had some non-pork meat options though. That's the only thing I can think of that they can improve on.  Maybe some turkey bacon/sausage or even veggie burgers.

We are fortunate enough not to suffer from any allergies and rarely eat any bread or pastry product that is GF. We ordered the biscuits and gravy and the breakfast sandwich both came with breakfast potatoes. The hubby said the biscuits were an unusual texture and just ok. I likewise didn't care for the texture of my bread, dry and crumbly.. But I could tell the other ingredients in my sandwich were good quality. I ended up ditching the bread and only eating the insides but the potatoes were yummy! We also both had lattes and the almond mocha was crazy good! I think we will go give it a try again, for sure for a cute little hideout to enjoy a morning coffee! If we had known it is GF, We would likely have chosen items less bread based!",

Let me detail my last and final visit: terrible customer service- I was not greeted, just asked what I wanted and scowled at when I had a couple of questions about the menu(I get having a bad day but you should never take it out on a paying/tipping customer!!), and actually had to ask for a number so I could receive my food... The omelet I ordered was hardly cooked (when I asked it to be well done- runny eggs are atrocious to me) and it was seriously served COLD. I just can't! Worst of all, I ordered a cup of black coffee and was making my way outside when I was bumped by a staff member, spilling my coffee everywhere and wasn't even offered an apology or a refill... when I sat down with 2 oz. Of coffee and a terrible omelet I got up and left. I have never walked out of a restaurant until this day. I don't know if I just came on bad days or what but I can assure you I will not be giving this place a 4th try ): Arcadia has several other excellent breakfast joints that offer better food, service and coffee.",

I was not disappointed, I ordered a salad that was pretty good. I was more excited about the apple fritter I ended my meal with, I was elated by how wonderful it was. I rarely eat baked desserts anymore as it is difficult to find ones that are not only safe for me to eat but that actually have good texture and taste good. Many people think to make up for the missing gluten by adding excessive sugar and it reunions the dessert. Jewels fritter was perfect, not to sweet and wonderful fluffy texture. I will definitely be back to try more of there meal items, as well as more baked desserts! So glad to have found a place that is catered towards people with gluten allegies and is in my area of town!",

    "text": "There are so many reasons I hate that Jewel's has the best chicken and waffles of all time. 1. It's not a chicken 'n' waffles place. There are plenty of chicken 'n' waffles places. This is better. 2. Everything is entirely gluten-free. Even when I factor that culinary feat out of the equation, this dish is best in show. As I'm shoving a fluffy, crispy Belgian waffle into my face hole, I find myself wondering why gluten even exists.  3. It's a bakery, but the meat is better than most restaurants. The chicken is tender, boneless, and there are no bad pieces. The fried coating is entirely crispy and incredibly flavorful. Ask for extra. It doesn't come with all that much, and you'll want it. 4. It's not a Southern joint, but you get warm buttermilk syrup and Sriracha honey, and it beats hot sauce and honey by miles (coming from a Nashville native, tail betwixt legs.) 5. The whole thing is topped off with crispy kale pieces, which, despite seeming superfluous, is entirely necessary and adds a fantastic, toasty flavor. 6. There are too many insane-looking desserts not to get one. The creamy lemon meringue with graham crust is superior to the slightly gummy apple pie, but if you're limited to GF goodies, they'll be the best you eva had. I put Jewel's up against \"normal\" bakeries because nothing about them reminds me they're gluten-free.  However, the comprehensive experience is a mixed bag. On my first visit, the kitchen staff called out, \"we can't make that. The iron broke.\" And the cashier simply said, \"so... what can I get you that's not chicken and waffles?\" The blase shut-down sans any alternative offerings was a bummerdrag, especially since we came specifically to try that dish. (As substitute-for-waffle items go, the fine-crumb biscuits are awesome. The eggy, but basic, French toast doesn't pair quite as well.) Another time, the staff had little clue what was in the pastry case, and despite nothing requiring prep, took 10 minutes to get two pieces of pie to our table. This would be ignorable if there were more than three people in the cafe. The ambiance is basic, and like most Arizona things, Jewel's is in a strip mall. Fanf*ckingtastic food combined with hum-dum everything else earns an emotionally-conflicted four stars from me, because Jewel's really does have the best chicken and waffles I've ever had.",

    "text": "I've tried Jewel's now 4 different times, months apart, hoping it would improve. When you must be gluten free, sometimes you long for a delicious doughnut or cupcake. You won't be getting a delicious one here. I can only speak to the pastries, but they are flavorless. Cupcakes are always dry and the frosting is like biting into shortening, though I think shortening might have more flavor.   How you can ruin a vanilla cupcake, I just don't know. Jewel's was able to do it-no vanilla flavor coming through in the cake or the frosting. Maple pecan scone? I did detect a faint amount of maple flavor in the bit of icing on top, but otherwise it was a gigantic blob of a tasteless, dry biscuit. Raspberry fritter? Tasted like a deep fried yeast ball, though the glaze was similar to a regular fritter.   I really was hopeful that there would be flavor this last time, but alas, none. I even bought 4 different pastries yesterday, surely one of them would be moist and flavorful? Nope, not one.",

    "text": "No. No. No, no, no, no.   I've been meaning to try this place for quite a while. The menu looked fun and any place with the word \"bakery\" in it already has brownie points (heh). We roll in on a Saturday around lunchtime and the first impression is totally meh. Nothing special about the space, and the set up is confusing with virtually nonexistent signage. Do you sit yourself? Are there servers? I see a counter, but no menu posted. Where do you order? No clue. We get in a line that was moving at glacial speed, which I guess is good as it gave us time to peruse the paper menus and ogle the baked goods. They brought out a fresh tray of salted caramel brownies while we were standing there, so foolish me thought we'd hit the jackpot, the holy trinity of carbs, fat, and sugar, fresh off the press.   I ask what the soup of the day is, and -- whoops! -- they're out of soup. Well, okay, grilled cheese with avocado and fries. My SO orders quiche, but -- whoops! -- they're out of that. He defaults to the meat loaf sandwich, and we ask about pop -- there's no fountain, and a cooler up front is practically empty. Well, that's all they got there in that little cooler: chocolate milk, coconut water, cucumber soda, root beer, and a couple of fruit sodas. All fully loaded -- no zero/low cal options, not even water. (Lest I sound like the world's fattest hypocrite, I will stuff my face but I don't drink my calories, unless they are alcohol. Period.) The employee is totally disinterested and unapologetic. We add one of those caramel brownies and before you know it, lunch is $35. For lunch!? Ohhhhh-kay. While we're ordering, an employee comes out from the kitchen through one of those swinging doors, and when the kitchen side is visible I catch a printed sign saying something like all employees using disposable cups for personal beverages will be charged $1 a cup. Fucking tacky. I hope I hallucinated it. Even if you're that much of an asshole to treat employees that way, I'd hope you'd have the sense to put the sign somewhere where customers might not see it.   We sit. And wait. And wait. And wait. It took well over half an hour for the food to come out. My sandwich and fries were stone cold. The slices of avocado were practically paper thin. The bread was dry and hard. The \"meatloaf\" sandwich got the same treatment, with the portion of meatloaf so thin my SO suggested that it might just be meat paste instead. His sandwich was full on burnt on one side. His fries were like one giant mass of fries all stuck together in a lump. His meal was pretty much inedible. I hoped the fresh brownie would maybe at least somewhat redeem the situation, but its edges were hard and even its middle was dry. The flavor was bland and I've made countless batches of brownies from Ghiardhelli mix that were 1000x better than these.   The experience would be completely maddening but let's face it, it crossed that line and is now just frankly absurd. I have NO IDEA how this place is in business. I don't know how it has any reviews above two stars. It's beyond \"oh, they were having an off day\". It's thievery. $35 for an inedible meal. No one acknowledged the fact it took half an hour to get the food, and apparently no one acknowledged the fact the food was cold and burnt -- they just sent it out anyway. Patently offensive. There are way too many other reliable and delicious lunch options in the area for that price, and even much less -- save your time and money.",

    "text": "I was looking for a quaint place to take my mother for mother's day along with my daughter that might also be able to handle my food sensitivities.  Jewel's looked like it would tick each box.  I called and made our reservation for 3 at 11:30 am outside knowing that the weather would be perfect.  I also asked if they would be able to provide me with any vegan options and the person I spoke to on the phone said they could speak to the kitchen and make sure they had either waffles or pancakes available for me.  I asked for waffles and asked if my special mother's day cupcake could be vegan as well.  She said that was no problem and promised me she would make a note of it for the kitchen.  The day came and we were running a bit behind due to the fact that traffic was pretty much a slow crawl all the way to the restaurant.   I called and they said that would be no problem at all.  We finally arrived and were told to wait a few minutes while they cleared off our table.  No problem.  Once we were taken to our table, however, we knew this wasn't going to work out.  The table was barely big enough for two, let alone three with food, drinks and mother's day memorabilia.  We asked for a bit bigger of a table and they told us they could not accommodate us right away, but we would have to wait 10 more minutes for a table to be available.  A bit put off, we agreed to wait and sat in front of the restaurant until they were able to find a table that would work after they assured us the wait would be worth it.  Finally they led us inside to a table only slightly bigger than before, but with booth space on one side which we would be able to put bags, purses, etc on.  We said this would be fine and we sat down and waited.  And waited.   When no one showed up to take our drink order or food order we finally realized that we had to go stand in the ever growing line to put in our order for food since no one initially felt the need to share this important bit of information when we were seated.  There was only one person taking orders and making drinks and the line was long.  It was mother's day after all.  I waited in line for what seemed like forever until someone got the attention of another person in the kitchen who finally opened up a second register.  I was appalled at the extreme lack of service up until this point, and starving.  I finally make it up to put in our order and I begin by asking if the vegan waffles were available.  The lady behind the counter looks confused and begins asking almost every one of the cooks if there are any vegan waffles available.  All I see is one shake of the head after another.  Finally, one of them looks at me and says \"we don't have a special vegan waffle maker.\"  Confused I tell them I don't need anything separate from a normal waffle maker, I am just not able to have eggs or milk.  They stare at me for a moment and finally say that they can, but it will take an additional 20 minutes for them to make special vegan waffles for me.  After being assured that they would have them available and ready for me, I was very put off.  This is not at all how I imagined my perfect mother's day brunch to go.  I decide to endure my intestinal problems due to the fact that I was beyond starving at this point.  I order for the three of us and (thankfully) discovered they did, at least have a vegan cupcake for me to enjoy.  I return to sit down and we begin the long wait for our food to be ready.  Again, after what seems like forever, the food arrives and it was not at all worth the wait, the hassle or the unkempt promises.  The bacon was cold and the rest of the food was lukewarm at best.  The cupcake was good, but for that to be the only part of the mother's day that was memorable is saying something about Jewel's Cafe portion.  The place was so crowded that we could barely move around and by the time we were done the entire table was full of trash, plates and drink cups.  Only once did someone come by to ask if we needed something so we could get a refill on our coffee.  In conclusion, as a bakery with gluten free and vegan options I imagine this place could be pretty good and possibly for lunch on a weekday, but steer clear of this place if you are looking for a memorable mother's day or any other holiday experience.  They are obviously not equipped to handle as big of a crowd as they had.  We will not be returning.  Not ever.",

    "text": "This little place is literally a Jewel! We had a great experience even though we didn't get what we wanted due to items containing dairy. We will go back for sure! We tried the chicken and waffles, curried chicken sandwich, and the omelet. The chicken and waffles were so crispy and yet literally melted in your mouth. Both of the sauces they serve are excellent and give you a completely different flavor profile. One is caramel and the other is a sweet heat type. The chicken was crispy and moist. The curried chicken salad sandwich needed some spice, but was still way above average on that vegan/gf ciabatta bread. Fries were a bit limp but hand cut so the flavor forgave the sog. The omelet was very good. Just a normal omelet. The homestyle potatoes were good. The vegan cupcake was delish and the pecan pie bar was equally as good. So...the only con I have is that they need more dairy free choices to go with the gluten free. They do have vegan options, but no waffles or pancakes unless they are slow. The customer service was excellent and they were very busy. Good enough to bring us back again and again.",

I actually prefer the original recipes for the breaded chicken dishes but I am not complaining as we just don't have very many 100% gluten free restaurants. There are hiccups sometimes like an order of french toast if I could even call it that which was part of a larger take out order that went south. After a facebook message and a physical note left on another visit no response from management. Aside from that, the chicken is great, the pancakes are great and the onion rings in all their amazing deliciousness are my favorites!

No more donuts which was the one delight - as a person with Celiac can never dream of having. Recently we tried again, and the quiche is now gone. The cranberry scones that were the best - with or without flour - gone. Of course a place can change up their offerings, but what Jewels has failed to understand is that when they first opened, they created \"cravable\" selections - things that bring people back again and again. We have all but given up on Jewels because they are so unreliable. Go back to where you started, Jewels, and then maybe offer a \"specials\" menu if you want to try new things. But unfortunately you've lost us as a customer because we've been disappointed too many times.",

I love that the ENTIRE kitchen is gluten free so you don't have to worry about cross contamination. I always get the grilled cheese which you could never guess was gluten free and some french fries (OMG so good).   My mom orders the waffles there because their syrup is literally the best syrup I have ever tasted. It's a buttermilk syrup that is very sweet so you don't need to use a ton of it. My boyfriend springs for the chicken and waffles which has the buttermilk syrup but also fried chicken on top. You will never miss \"glutened\" fried chicken again!   The wait staff when we went has always been on top of it (we come at off hours, never at exactly noon). Their hours recently changed, as noted by a sign on their door, so I will call ahead if I plan to come very early or very late in case things change or special events go on. It's definitely worth it to come and visit and especially if you have celiac disease, you will be in HEAVEN! The price also is extremely affordable, I might even say cheap. For two people for lunch we only spent about $20 (no drinks, just entrees but free water). I think that's a great value and there's also a bakery to order cupcakes and brownies.... yummmm!",

Never shipped called 2 weeks later they acted like they had no clue what i was talking about promised to ship it, the shipment got lost, after multiple phone calls and A rude staff and a whole month of trying to get the flour i paid for I drove down there to pick it up. I finally thought they made it right. Got home and realized the flour was packaged in much smaller bags and was not given what i paid for. Went back online to double check and they evidently removed that service. End result I paid $48 for about 3lbs of flour and had to drive a 45 min drive after paying shipping costs. Will NEVER return. Lost my business and all recommendations. The staff hangs up on you and refuses to communicate.",

Our server was friendly and efficiently took our orders.  I enjoyed the AZ omelette with egg whites, sausage, bell peppers, onions, cheddar and house potatoes.  Nice atmosphere, friendly service and good food.    My only complaint is someone took my husband's plates (pancakes & eggs) while he still was finishing/chewing his food - definitely threw us all off with that!  I kept wondering if they were running out of plates and that is why they swiped us up before he was even completely done eating.",

    "text": "Disappointing. If your only allergy is gluten, go for it. But if you're allergic to tree nuts, it's not worth risking your life. Items in the bakery case were only sporadically labeled for other allergens. I asked about the lemon cheesecake bar, and the order-taker had to ask a chef if there was almond flour in it because it WASN'T LABELED. (There was indeed almond flour.) A vegan muffin had a \"vegan\" label but no mention of the pecans covering the top. As for the \"No Way, Jose\" omelet: the omelet was so-so. Chorizo was fantastic. Avocado was mostly black and inedible. Salsa was spectacular. The staff was extremely friendly; they simply weren't given the information they need to provide a safe, allergy-free experience, which is a shame. The doughnut selection was limited and uninspiring. (Since it's a bakery, I went there for doughnuts.) They mostly offered cupcakes, but that limits the bakery selection considerably. There was no bread (another thing I went for), so overall, this was an underwhelming visit. However, the brownie was phenomenal. The cinnamon-sugar doughnut was only ok. I'll give a star for the brownie and a star for the people. Another star for the omelet. But the lack of allergy labeling and lack of selection means this stays at a three-star rating.",

    "text": "Whether you believe celiac disease is a real epidemic or just overhyped, its no secret that restaurants around the valley are taking great pains to emphasize what items have gluten (a common component of most grains) and which items don't.  Whether borne of a celiac diagnosis or just a personal preference, customers are demanding gluten alternatives.  And restaurants like Jewel's have decided to answer the call.  I don't have the disease, but I was nevertheless curious about how good the breakfast as Jewel's was.  With that, I headed here first thing on Sunday morning.  Look for Jewel's on the southeast corner of 40th Street & Thomas Road, at the far east end of the strip center.  This restaurant with seating for I'd guess 60 (including about 25 on the patio outside) proudly showcases their baked goods in full view of the dining room and their menus read like a newspaper publication (intentionally so, I'm sure).  Owner Justine Dachel is the brains of this breakfast and lunch operation and her menu openly dares customers to rethink their pre-conceptions of gluten-free offerings.  Basically she's out to prove that gluten free doesn't have to mean bland.  Okay then, challenge accepted.  After grabbing a glass of OJ, I glanced over the menu before settling on what it seems like everyone loves at this place.  I've had Lo-Lo's legendary chicken and waffles many times and I've tried other versions elsewhere with mixed results.  But my waitress was quite giddy when I asked how good the chicken and waffles were at this place.  So I grabbed that and a side of fruit for my breakfast.  Additionally, they honor the Yelp Check-In offer for a free cookie.  And it just so happened a batch of fresh chocolate chip cookies had just been baked.  One please, thank you.  Total cost for the food, OJ, tax and tip came to $28.  I actually started with the cookie, because cookies as a breakfast starter are perfectly acceptable, right?  Warm, soft, and lots of chocolate chips.  The way it should be, and its delicious.  The seasonal fruit bowl I received was a mix of blueberries and strawberries.  Cold, clean, just the right size for a side portion.  Now for the main event.  You get a whole Belgian waffle cut into four identical parts, three pieces of boneless buttermilk fried chicken, and a pair of sauces.  One is a buttermilk syrup, while the other is a spicy honey sauce.  There's no rulebook on how to attack this, but I opted for the following strategy.  Cut up the chicken into equal pieces and place on top of each waffle, then douse each in both sauces.  Basically go all in with every bite.  I'm pleased to say this strategy worked.  Even more pleased to report that all the parts of this dish are wonderful.  The breading on the chicken is surprisingly light and the waffle soaked up everything beautifully.  I was partial to the honey sauce, but both sauces working together were quite magical.  Highly recommend getting a little of everything in each bite, but the chicken and waffles by themselves are of excellent quality.  An absolutely splendid first impression put forth by Justine and her crew.  I left full but not uncomfortably so.  The staff were bubbly and efficient.  The prices were reasonable, and the food was excellent.  Comparing the chicken and waffles here to Lo-Lo's is comparing apples and oranges so I won't get in the middle of that.  Just know this.  The food here is good.  Don't be scared of the gluten-free emphasis.  Just listen to your tastebuds and your tummy when they thank you for putting all this goodness in you.  And be sure to thank Justine for giving the valley this Jewel of a restaurant (see what I did there?).",

Their black coffee is brewed fresh, very acidic and dark. Service is decent and could be better but our server was moving a little slow for having a couple tables.   I believe they have three or four different chicken and waffle specialties but they're all delicious! Any of them could be made gluten free! They also serve gluten free baked good. We both got the Nashville hot chicken and waffles. Waffle was perfect: warm, a little sweet and crispy. Chicken was sort of flavorless, a little greasy and needed more seasoning. We shared a gluten free chocolate chip scone. Scratch that, we devoured a very mouthwatering scone that was well worth the guilt that came with it. Enjoyable experience for us both!",

The food is also made fresh, so expect a bit of a wait on that as well.  I ordered the chorizo omelet, and got a mint chocolate donut. The omelet was delicious, great flavor on the chorizo and very fluffy eggs but the chorizo was a bit too greasy for my liking. My entire plate was covered in grease by the end of my meal. The donut, where do I start. SO GOOD. I was so surprised. The flavor was on point, the texture was fluffy yet so moist. I ate the entire thing, highly recommend grabbing a donut before you leave. Husband ordered the fried chicken sandwich, which he enjoyed. The portion of chicken was huge! Moist and not too much breading.  Our service was okay, my order came out wrong to begin. Our water cups were empty for most of our meal, and our table was out of most condiments. Service was slow but the food did come out piping hot and fresh.   If your in the mood for fried chicken or donuts, this place will satisfy!",

    "text": "Chicken and waffles is so passe, it's time for chicken and donuts to reign!  After attending a donut festival, I fell in love with Jewel's chicken and donuts. So much so I went back and got several samples...until I couldn't take it anymore and went straight to Jewel's the very next day.  I haven't tried any of the other menu items but this is why they are the best!  First off, the chicken is smalls popcorn bites. They were moist, crisped to perfection and accompanied by a delicious sauce with a light spice. The donuts are light and slightly crisped, adorned with sugar and a buttery syrup sauce. The combination of the sweet and savory is perfect and is the perfect serving size. For the order you get a good amount of chicken and donuts. They even made sure there were the exact same amounts of each.  I would have given this place 5 stars but I ordered online and when I arrived they said they don't have an order system. It was really weird but luckily I was able to cancel the order and just order it there instead.   Definitely give this place a try. Next menu item to try...the Waffle pops!",

The chicken was super tender and packed just the right amount of spice but nothing over powering.  Overall great experience, I recommend trying.",

    "text": "TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.  After looking at reviews and pictures, we decided to try this place while we had friends visiting from out of town. Since we had a large party, we knew we would need to make a reservation. So we did. We realized we would be running a little late, so we called ahead and let them know we were running late, to which they said they would accommodate us. However, once we arrived to the restaurant we were informed another party \"pretended\" to be us and took our reservation. There was a group of 14 of us. How can a restaurant not ask to verify name at the time of seating? I'm still so confused how a place can let this happen. And for whoever claimed to be our group, shame on you! Stealing someone else's reservation is just messed up.",

Coming from Scottsdale, our party paid quite a bit on Lyft but we wanted to try this place out. When we got there, the person in charge seemed confused. He stated that another party had claimed they were us and taken our reservation. Then he stated the kitchen was really backed up and he wasn't sure when he would be able to seat us. Not sure which is the True story, but either way he offered no consolation to our group. I went back and asked what the plan was. Was our reservation cancelled, or were we supposed to wait for a table to open up. He remained unsure and so we left for another restaurant. Kind of odd for a business to be so clueless.  Update: I asked for a phone call when our table was ready. The \"manager\" happily agreed. 4 hours later, no call and no update. Way to run a business guys!",

One meal we ordered was chicken and waffles.  This combo came with a sweet and a spicy sauces and was a big winner for taste.  My order was a portabello mushroom burger.  With a delicious bun that reminded me of Schlotski's bread, the sandwich was served with fries and plenty of veggies on the burger. The Green Tea was notably good.   With free refills, the thirst-quenching, drink encouraged us to enjoy a healthy hydration.   For dessert we tried a chocolate cookie, mochaccino caramel cupcake, and pecan pie.  They were fresh and delicious and a great take-home item.  These are part of a selection that includes scones, pies, donuts and bars.   Anthony was our server and kept us satisfied with ideal suggestions for food and beverage.  To my delight, the owner/chef came out from the kitchen and spent time visiting with customers.  This place is a great lunch time treat that will cater to vegans and the glutton-free crowd while pleasing their omnivorous friends.",

I had scouted this place out and really enjoyed the whole experience. I had their house salad with kale and romain 2 of my favorites & not too much for newbies on kale. The champaign  vinaigrette was spot on.   The adult grilled cheese  I also tasted and was thrilled to see it on the menu.   Their local coffee blend was super tasty and served in Avery large cop, like an extra large cappuccino.   very satisfying and not an espresso which was pleasantly surprising as it was bold enough to bring a smile and I drank every last drop. i also sampled the original brownie with powdered sugar....!!! I ordered this to go as I was fully satisfied with the meal and coffee I actually had to digest before diving into the next course... It was delicious!!    The texture, the flavor the smell was True brownie recall!!  I ate half of the meal and took the remainder home to enjoy all over again.  It was reasonable in price and parking is ample!!!  The atmosphere to me is urban sheik, eclectic and clean. The servers were positive and mindful and that speaks Volumes in this industry!  The intrigue with this new gem is that they are open to 9p and have happy hour & specials during the week!!    I was impressed with what Jewel's offers in the pastry station as gluten free can be a drag for desert yet she has re energized the gluten free stereo-type with a professional appearance that makes you want to come back and enjoy in moderation the sweetness that you remember when....  The first of gluten free experience in the industry here in Phx  that I promote and smile in regards too having a whole  body experience which is what brings me back as a repeat customer.  Yes, I know it's challenging to go out and grab a bite as a chef however it all adds up to the experience the flavor the appearance and visuals and the aroma.... This is how I help others achieve their top notch in the industry for repeat business which is a cornerstone for ones success!! Takes one to know one  Enjoy-",

My cold-brew was tasty and they offer coconut milk along with the creamer/sugar selection so that was really nice. I'm leaving the review as 3-star because I found my sausage and egg breakfast sandwich to be pretty dry and bland. Also the menu online doesn't match the menu they offer in the store, so don't be one of those people who looks ahead and decides what you want... they may not offer it. My experience doesn't really seem to match all the good reviews so maybe I will try it again down the road.  Original review: I would love to try this place out but the two times I have stopped by before work they have still had the doors locked at 7:10am even though the sign on the door says open at 7am. :( :( :(",

So maybe my expectations were too high from my conversation with them at the farmer's market.   The positives: *Great ambience and location *Coconut creamer for the coffee :) -awesome to have a non-dairy option *Vegan muffins - we had the apple cinnamon and it was really good *the potato/kale hash was great  Things that could be better: *The line is confusing about which side to enter, therefore, we waited for a couple huge groups to go in front of us coming from the exit side of the line before we were helped, its probably hard for the cashier to know who is next-maybe a sign would be helpful? *There were no vegan cupcakes or scones available (11am), only muffins, we were really excited to be able to buy cupcakes and disappointed when they had multiple other, but all with dairy. We normally go to Treehouse, but this is so much closer.  *Our food (one order) took about 20 minutes, this might get worked out as they settle in, but it was a long wait (one of the chefs did come talk to us and apologized) * the smoothie tasted like pureed kale, they did ask for feedback on it, which was great, but doesn't help my situation at the moment, i tossed it when i got home  * there are minimal vegan options on the menu, I saw 3, I guess I was expecting more based on their baked goods and other options at the farmers market (so this could be my own issue, but I was really disappointed, there is such a need for that in this area)  Overall, the food was ok, the ambience is great! I didn't try the coffee but it looked good. So, I would go back for coffee and if in stock, a vegan cupcake, but not again for breakfast.   Glad their is a dedicated gluten free bakery, but I would love to see more vegan options too.",

This is a hipster place and everything is gluten free, though you can't really taste a difference if you ask me. Probably won't be going back.",

I haven't had biscuits and gravy in the last 5 years since being on a very strict GF diet. This morning I got an order to go when picking up cupcakes for a party. Let me tell you that it was love at first bite! It was a perfect blend of sausage gravy with a delicious biscuit and when some of the potato hash got mixed in, well, I couldn't have wiped the smile of my face for any reason.   I really don't know what I will do next time I'm there for breakfast. Get the B&G or try anything else on the 100% GF menu. Either way, this is my new favorite place to share with all my non-gluten free people. Even though it's a 40 minute drive from my side of town, it's worth it.",

Ordered two orders of pancakes -- one plain, one with blueberry compote.  25 minutes later the lukewarm plain order of pancakes came out.  Server said the other order would be out soon, waited a couple minutes but they were already getting cold.  Ate my lukewarm pancakes with half a packet of butter (seriously it was a small scoop in one of those plastic containers used for to go salsa!). Three bites left and he bring the other order of pancakes.  Less than a dozen blueberries rolling in the plate.  Apologized and said another server took our order of blueberry pancakes and they had to make another. They looked like they had been sitting on a tray. No steam coming off as if they had just been freshly made. Maybe he just screwed up the order.   Who knows.  Whatever it was we'll not be going back.   Too bad.  We like our breakfasts at neighborhood restaurants on weekend mornings.",

No donuts or sticky rolls or loaves of bread. Only a few cupcakes in the freezer, which is normally full of goodies. We drove 45 minutes out of our way to indulge on items that only Jewels could provide, but none of this existed this time. And then they advertise the eggless eggs that they were out of too!!! Another reason we made the trek as my husband hasn't been able to eat eggs for years. Oh and no vegan cheese options either which I was a bit confused over since I know they are so \"food sensitive\" conscious. The whole experience was frustrating and so disappointing! I only gave the second star because the chicken was moist in the chicken and waffles. If this is the norm now at Jewels, then we won't be back. Nor will we continue to tell our gluten free community to make the drive. So disappointing and this was supposed to be an early Mother's Day gift.",

    "text": "If I could give 0 stars, I would.  We've given Jewel several chances.  The last time was over a year ago.  The wait then was excruciating.  The line to order was terrible, but the at least the food was decent.  Today, however, was horrible from beginning to end.  It was somewhat encouraging to find that the line to order was very short.  The restaurant was busy, but it appeared they had it under control.  Sadly, the woman taking the order got the first thing wrong..instead of a regular latte, she almost put in for a chai latte.  Luckily, my husband caught that.  We took a seat on the patio and there we sat for over an hour waiting for scrambled eggs, a bowl of fruit and 2 pancakes!!  There were at least 5 different people who were delivering the food to tables.  Over and over we heard people asking how much longer it would be.  The response...oh sorry, we are short staffed today, only two cooks!!!  What kind of chef training does it take to make scrambled eggs and throw some batter on the griddle!!  They had plenty of bodies who could have helped back there.   My husband went in to ask how much longer.  After standing a waiting for a few more minutes, they handed him two to-go sacks and said here you go!!  We never asked for the food to go.  He informed them were on bikes and were sitting on the patio.  They apologized again and offered free pastries!!  They told him they would plate the food and bring it out. He got another latte, no charge, as consolation!!  Finally, when the food came, once again we got the standard, I'm sorry for the wait!!   Maybe the wait would have been worth it, but the food was HORRIBLE!!  Scrambled eggs, hard and dry.  The fruit bowl was overly ripe.  The so-called syrup for the pancake was terrible and sweet and grainy.  My husband's two sunny side up eggs were so salty, he could barely eat them.  One of his two pancakes was also super salty.  The other one was tolerable.   We don't go out for breakfast often because we don't want to spend all morning doing so.  If we had wanted a full morning dedicated to eating, we would have gone for a nice brunch.  With the tip (which we should have asked to be refunded) our two little meals, no juice, no meat, came to $40!!   The only positive about the whole experience, was sitting on the patio.  But the patio at Jewel's could be made so much more pleasant with some shrubs.  If there had been no cars parked along the fence we would have had no block from Thomas Road.  Why don't you spend a little a put up some nice shrubs along the fence..you have a planter out there and it would soften the whole thing. I don't know how long you have been in existence, but I'm guessing at least three years.  We were initially excited about you being a gluten free restaurant, but there are many other choices and we won't be back!!",

They have a range of breakfast, and lunch items, even stuff for the kids. To top it off they even have dessert which was amazing as well. They also sell loafs of bread and some flour to make cookies or brownies with, as well as some honey and a few other gluten free things. The place is a decent size, they also have patio seating which is gorgeous!  I had the rocky road brownie and it was rich and moist. Im not really a brownie fan because most brownies ive had were either too dry or lacked A LOT of flavor. This one did not. I did find 2 hairs in my brownie. One under the marshmellows they put on top and one inside, when i was pulling it apart it didnt seem to let go of the other half of brownie and that was why. One of the cooks saw and came over with a new brownie.   Some may find it gross and never return after finding hair in their food. To me it was gross and i was disgusted but not enough to not give them a second chance. I wish they would wear a hair net though because it could have been prevented that way..  As far as everything else, their pancakes are amazing! Potatos as well! Between the bacon and sausage i would recommend the sausage, bacon is somewhat always dry when ive gotten it. Their syrup/butter sauce they give you is to die for! Its a place to check out, and an experience for those of you that arent gluten free to taste the difference. If im in the area, i MIGHT stop by, but because i dont need to eat gluten free there are plenty of other places in the area that id rather eat it.",

The food WAS really tasty, it was reasonably priced, and the place itself was cute, but I found out mid-way through the meal (by reading a review online and then confirming with the waitress) that most, if not all, of the food has oat flour in it or is subject to cross-contamination with it. Which is too bad, because oats are off limits for some people with celiac disease, including me. I feel so dumb for not checking, but in my own defense, I was told by some reputable sources it was a safe place, so had a False sense of security there.    So..... the rest of my meal was given to my kid,  who does not have celiac disease. So bummed. I wish they had some indication of the presence of the oat flour or other allergens  on their menu or even on the website. If it was present on either, I missed it.   Maybe I'll go back once my first year is up and I'm allowed to re-introduce oats, but til then, I won't be returning.",

We tried a wide variety of food between the various meals that we had their. We tried quiche, chicken and waffles, onion rings, a breakfast sandwich, a pulled pork sandwich, a breaded chicken sandwich, gluten free pancakes and biscuits with gravy.

I had the chicken and waffles. The waffle was so yummy, light and crispy, just the right amount of flavor and something that just made it taste amazing. The chicken was good too, actually tenders not a piece of chicken on the bone. Came with a buttermilk syrup of their making and a spicy honey. Both yum. My husband, not gf but supports me by eating gf when he has too, had pancakes and he said they were very tasty. I took a bit and I agreed, nice thickness to them too. I received a free cupcake for my birthday, I choose Carmel. The place itself is charming with old metal chairs, different colors. Open white space with some brick. Not over done on decor just a nice bakery and cafe! The coffee lattes were also good but I was enjoying the food to much to really notice. Our server was great and all the staff were friendly and wished me a happy birthday! A happy happy gluten-free breakfast birthday to me!",

Got their garden tacos, but they were missing the quinoa... which is one of the reasons I chose them! Nonetheless they were delicious, but lacked the protein I would've liked. I wish it was communicated to me prior.   The front of house staff is okay, some rude some curt some friendly- all in all, not consistent. Food service was slow.   I would come back with company to try a few more things on the menu, but I'm in no hurry.",

The kitchen and our server had some miscommunication that made ordering a little difficult. Initially my husband was told that he could order from the breakfast menu (his favorite.) Then, he was told that he couldn't. It went back and forth that way a few times before everything was settled. Once we got through it, everything was fine. Our waiter was really attentive and the dinner was pretty good.   I had the chorizo hush puppies and Thai shrimp tacos. I loved the dipping sauce with the hush puppies. I thought these were really good but don't expect them to taste like southern style hush puppies. The tacos were great! They were spicy and the shrimp were large and tasty.   My husband got the beef stroganoff. He was a little disappointed with it. He thought it lacked garlic and salt.   Jewel's still does a great breakfast and the pastries are fantastic. I'm hoping that a little more time will get the dinner menu and service up to par.",

    "text": "This past Saturday was our first venture here and it was great! My wife has been GF for a while and it has at times been a struggle to find a place that has some decent options on the menu. However, Jewels literally has an entire menu dedicated to GF and vegan diners that is absolutely delicious!  My wife had the chorizo & cheese omelette topped with fresh avocado with a side of crispy potatoes and I opted for the \"chedda\" biscuits & gravy, over easy eggs and crispy potatoes too. Everything was great! Food was fresh, flavors were all there - \"chedda\" biscuits were dense (GF does that) but, had a wonderful rich flavor paired with a thick peppery sausage gravy. Service was awesome - quick, friendly and will answer any questions u may have about the menu. Sit down or take out - even a small patio to enjoy the outdoors when it cools down. Open for breakfast & lunch.  The sweets looked fantastic as well. Donuts, brownies, cupcakes, yum! Next time we stop in we will be grabbing some dessert to go!",

I don't have any gluten sensitivity but some members of my family do which is why we went here. They really enjoyed the food and raves about the bakery selection. If it the rating was on food alone 5/5.   However, the initial service was poor. The wait was originally 20 minutes (no big deal). There were clearly open tables both inside and outside but I attributed that to not a full being full staff. There is only one bench outside for waiting so you end up standing or sitting on the curb. 1/2 hour later and we are still waiting and now there are even more open tables. When we finally get seated, they crowd five of us at a four person table. There was food all over the ground by our table. Not what I want to see when I'm about to eat. Our server was great and made up for the rough start. She was attentive and the food arrived quickly.   I would recommend the food here for anyone who is GF, but maybe order takeout and/or come during the week.",

    "text": "Holy forking shirtballs.   Quick background: the guy is gluten intolerant, and gluten is the love of my life. I generally will try his gf meals and if they are normal things made to be gluten free, they are usually terrible and I hate them. Okay, so: holy forking shirtballs.   Jewel's was not only his oasis, but a heaven that he never even contemplated dreaming up. We knew when we heard that it was a fully dedicated gluten free kitchen, that we at minimum needed to give it a try. He was absolutely delighted the second we walked through the door. We arrived around 1pm on a Saturday, and were seated immediately in the half-full restaurant. We each had a cold brew--they serve Press coffee here, yum! For our meals, he went with the Nashville hot chicken sandwich, and I went with the popcorn chicken and donuts. He said his chicken was super super tasty, and the bun was very good too. It was just a tiny bit fally-aparty at the end, but he didn't mind too much. The sandwich came with Frites Street fries, which were seasoned and tasty.   My popcorn chicken and donuts were phenomenal. I don't say this lightly. I have never had gluten free donuts that I have actively enjoyed, but these were absolutely fantastic. They tasted like donuts! Dipped into the warm buttermilk syrup, it was like just bites of crack cocaine. I don't usually like syrup very much at all, but this was just like molten caramel. The popcorn chicken was also fantastic. Beefy lil nugs of chicken with delicious and seasoned breading, they were fantastic on their own. But the best part? ALL OF THE DIPPING SAUCES. There are few things I love more in this world than a wide variety of dipping sauces. The dips I did the dip in: sweet chili, dill ranch, standard Heinz ketchup, buttermilk syrup. All 10/10 fantastic. Chicken 10/10 fantastic. Donuts 10/10 fantastic. Everything was wonderful. I'm hungry again thinking about it now.   We of course, couldn't leave without him picking up some goodies for the road. He got a chocolate chip cookie, a fudge brownie, and a lemon blueberry bar. He ranted and raved about all of them, but the lemon blueberry was the one that really blew his mind hole right open.   Without debate, we will absolutely be back. Frequently.",

Both the coffee and the cookie were an excellent way to start the morning .   I really liked the concept of the store and the menu, which is shaped as a newspaper with social media snippets and pictures, it is extremely creative and entertaining to look at. I also loved the fact that they use compostable cups instead of plastics.   For my meal I ordered the hot chicken and waffles which was delicious but it was an insanely large quantity of food. I would have taken half to go but I was traveling and did not have anywhere to store it which was a pity. For future visits I will make sure to split a meal with someone because one plate is definitely plenty for two people   Great job Jewel's! I wish more places were like you.",

The coffee here is really good. I tried the mocha and my girlfriend had the latte, both tasted great and came in very large mugs.  For food, I tried the breakfast bagel sandwich with egg and cheese, I opted to sub the bacon for turkey sausage (save the pigs!). The sandwich came with breakfast potatoes which were good too. The plate was huge! And I wasn't able to finish all of my food.  The service here was so good too! Our server was amazing and answered a ton of questions for us and she was totally fine with us taking over 20 minutes to decide on what to order... we just couldn't decide!  Overall I really enjoyed this restaurant. If you are gluten free then I'd highly recommend to visit here if you're in Phoenix.",

From the pictures, it looked like they gave huge portions for their dishes but they came out to about half the size.  I got the bacon waffle sando for $15 and my boyfriend got the Nashville hot chicken sandwich also for $15. We added an egg and the waffle bun to the chicken sandwich for an extra $4 totaling about $19 but it wasn't worth it at all. The waffles on both sandwiches tasted very plain and nothing like a waffle at all. The syrup that came with the waffles was good but overall it was just like pouring syrup on plain bread.  The chicken sandwich was supposedly an \"award winning chicken sandwich\" but it didn't seem award winning at at all for the price. The flavor was okay and the chicken breast was really overcooked and dry.  For the prices, we expected more from the hot chicken sandwich and the bacon waffle sando which were mediocre at best. The flavors just didn't stand out to us.  Our food came out in a timely manner and the service was okay. There were other menu items that sounded appealing but we would most likely not return anymore for overpriced and average tasting food.",

Every time I come here I have to beg to be acknowledged. Today the hostess told us she'd be right with us multiple times. In the meantime she was prioritizing gathering silverware from the kitchen to the front. Once we sat we waited probably 20 minutes before our server came over only after he was waved to come. We enjoyed our meal the food is always delicious, but took it upon ourselves to get condiments as to avoid the endless wait for help. Same process in getting the check. Our waiter was nowhere to be found so we had to hunt down a waitress just to pay and get out of there. Jewels, keep up the gluten free goodness but get better management and staff.

Also awkward closing an hour prior to posted time, locking the door with restaurant filled with customers and new customers outside at locked door trying to get in.   Service issues continued after being sat, didn't come for a drink order until well after other tables around us were served. Ordered food took over an hour for food to come. Server who brought the food went to three tables before finding us. And only one plate for our table of three. Each plate came out individually instead as table.   Had to ask for water twice before getting. Bottomless mimosa had to ask for refill when food came and took several minutes for it to come. Also know of the chemical mixing of champagne and orange juice cannot be shaken to mix! Saw loss of half the pitcher of mimosas due to this!  Had to ask twice for to-go box never received. Had to get my own.  Food was great! This is the only reason I might come back for a to-go order/ counter service, never for sit down service.",

When i asked about muffins i was told look in the small case. I asked how much the very small muffins were i was told 2.00 a peice and i had to buy how it came in boxes. I purchases a total of 4 muffins that are very very small and it came to 11.86 some how and when i asked why i recieved muffins that were showing over a week old she said dont worry we make thwm a long time ago and freeze them. I get them home just to have the peach muffin be hard on outside and very soggy and doughy inside. They tasted like they had been in a freezer for over a week. As someone with cilliaks i am willing to pay the extra for gluten free but i expect decent food and service this place has neither! I hope they improve their customer service and bakery items",

    "text": "Wanted to try this place because of the reviews and other food bloggers raving about it. Pictures looked amazing and honestly didn't read any Yelp reviews prior to visiting. Got there and it was a 45min. wait for 2 people. Decided to stick it out because it looked like it was worth it...  Finally got seated and had to wait another 20min. until our server noticed us and got us waters and took our order. There were large groups who got seated and ordered after us and we noticed they all received their food before us. Several tables had the same dishes as me and my boyfriend receiving their meals. By this time we had waited another 45min. for food. At this point, the entire restaurant had been reseated with new customers who arrived--you honestly can't help but wonder, question, and notice other tables around. When \"our\" food finally arrived, my boyfriend got his Hot Chicken and Waffles first and I had to wait another 20min. for my Chicken Ranch Sando sandwich. The food was okay, but it was not worth the 2 hour ordeal.   TLDR: Food is okay. Not worth the 45min. wait. Pet peeve was plates on the same ticket coming 20min. apart.",

    "text": "Jewel's Bakery Cafe is a gluten free breakfast- sort of brunch-ish restaurant located in the Arcadia area of Phoenix.   Short Story- The people working there were exceptionally NICE but the food took about an hour to prepare and was sort of slopped out and not necessarily correct.  Long Story- We entered and the place was packed, very energetic with people running around and very LOUD with many conversations going on. Someone runs up to us and tells us to pick one of the two open tables. We pick a table and it takes a while but our order is eventually taken.   We wait, wait and WAIT for our order. After 45 minutes we inquire about our order. We are told that it was like this all day and would be about ten more minutes. (we weren't sure if this was True and weren't sure if we wanted to leave) The waiter was very nice and offered us a free pastry for waiting and that was very NICE to do but we declined because we just wanted food.  My plate does come out soon. I ordered the Hot Chicken and Waffles. My Chicken is very dark in color and I thought it was burnt but the chicken was moist and juicy inside so it was OK......But it didn't taste anything like Hot Chicken that I ordered. On the side were waffles that were very good. The waffles were cooked perfect with a light crisp exterior and a fluffy moist middle....I liked the waffles but I didn't care for the strange syrup. It was a mix of buttery and very sweet..I think waffles taste better with real butter and real syrup.....  After a while someone did check on us and I said my plate was good but it wasn't spicy. That person said they'd bring me the spice dust.....Instead of spice dust someone runs out more syrup. This syrup tasted like SWEET buttery bacon with a Burn to it......This made me gag. I didn't enjoy it but I'm sure some people do.  While I got my plate of food there was a server running around with a plate of Hot Chicken and Waffles. They went to table to table wondering were it should go.......Ummmmmmm?  My husband had a Chorizo Omelette. He said the texture of the eggs were very strange and oddly dense. The omelet was suppose to be stuffed with fries but it wasn't but it did contain fries on the plate.  Condiments on table needed attention.  In the end they did take 25% off our bill for the long wait but I would rather pay full price, wait more reasonable and have our plates more technically and accurately prepared.",

The reason I give this place 3 stars is because of the price of the food, so I can't say that I'm a fan. I work in the offices above Jewel's and most of my coworkers agree that the food is a bit overpriced for the amount that you get. The roasted veggie, for example, is $7 and it's not very big... then they charge an extra $2 for a very small amount of fries. Also, during the lunch rush it takes a while to get your food. I find myself considering Jewel's if I'm too lazy to drive somewhere for lunch, but I usually talk myself out of it and either I don't eat, or I'll drive to Bertha's. I'd probably be a bigger fan if I had a gluten intolerance, but I don't. SO if you must have Gluten Free or you're not a cheap ass like me, then you'd probably give this place 5 stars.",

Cupcakes are bomb. Macaroons, you ask? Bomb diggity. Bread? Yes. Apparently they make their own flour and there is the secret.

It was inedible.  I brought my plate up to the cashier and asked where the chicken and rice was and they said oh im sorry we are out. I also asked why they found it necessary to drown the quinoa with vinegar and they said oh thats how we serve it.  I politely asked for a refund and left.  I was not happy with how they handle their business and would never dine here again. I also overheard a woman in the restaurant commenting on the baked goods have absolutely no flavor.

Brought the family up to Jewel's but didn't mention that it was a gluten free place (I am the only one gluten free in our family) we ordered bakery treats and breakfast items. As we were enjoying the pistachio donut, blueberry fritter and rocky road brownie I started to worry that maybe I had misunderstood and that these things were not gluten free. They were delicious! Not just good for gluten-free things, they could stand up to any gluten treat and still be great. I asked and they assured me that yes, everything is gluten free. :-) My family did not realize that these items were gluten free even after they ate them. Amazing taste and amazing texture. For breakfast we had bacon egg and biscuit sandwich and chorizo biscuits and gravy. The chorizo is ground fresh there on Fridays!  It was about 40 minute drive each way for us to get there but SO worth the trip.  I will definitely plan on going back, there are a number of amazing looking bakery items I can't wait to try. Tip: Order the rocky road brownie and ask for it to be heated, they warm it up and the marshmallows get all toasty and lightly browned.",

I waited about 10 min with only one person in front of me to be told, \"I don't think we have the creamed soup\" with no attempt to go look or ensure that there wasn't any. It is disappointing I haven't been able to try any of the foods as the service has been slow and the items are not available or staff does not look.

My favorite item is the grilled cheese with added avocado, my husband likes the BBQ pork sandwich.  He is a big cheesecake fan and we had the strawberry basil cheesecake when that was available which he said was the best cheesecake he had ever had!  We always buy a few white chocolate macadamia nut cookies as they are some of the BEST cookies I've had!  I made cookies at home recently and when looking for recipes my husband suggested I make them \"G-Free\" like the Jewel's cookies - I had to explain to him that many gluten-free cookies are not delicious and Jewel's is the exception :)  The staff is very friendly and welcoming and as you can see from the photos the interior is modern but warm and inviting - a really nice place to sit and chat over a delicious lunch.  I can't recommend Jewel's more!",

As a paying customer it is reasonable to expect a greeting and some type of gratitude for my service. I'm appalled at the poor attitude I've received and would even go further and suspect it is a race issue seeing as though my husband has gone through the same thing on a separate encounter. This feedback is coming from someone who has worked as an Executive in Hospitality for over 26 years. Please coach your staff/managers on the importance of quality service, food can not be only the deciding factor for the title of \"Best\".",

    "text": "I haaaaaaate to write a poor review for Jewel's because I absolutely love their food, teas, and baked goods. The decor is adorable and welcoming and most of the staff is extremely friendly.  But I am just SO frustrated, over and over, at the same server, that I just have to express it. There is one male server that, when I see him at the counter now, I cringe just knowing deep in bones I'm going to get poor service. If it was just one instance, I could just chalk it up that this guy just had a bad day...but this has happened now, 4 weekends in a row and coming in 1-2 times that weekend. And i don't feel I am a difficult customer that that would be the reason why he's so terrible...I only order takeout, I always call ahead, I ALWAYS tip, I usually spend a fairly large amount and I'm typically quick, nice, and patient. So here are just a few of my experiences with this poor server:  - I'm allergic to dairy and eggs & see a random sign in the baked goods counter that says \"vegan\". So I ask which items are vegan...no joke, his response \"oh yeah, everything is vegan...for the most part\". Umm, \"for the most part\" isn't going to keep my throat from closing up. KNOW THE FOODS YOU SERVE. Thank god another knowledgable employee stepped in to answer and show me exactly which items I can eat, without pain. I'd at least have respect for the guy if he just said \" I don't know, let me find out\"  - Every time I come in & he is at the counter, it takes him forever to take my order...even if no one is in line? And I only ask for some pre made sweets from the counter, since my takeout order is ready bc I called in advance.   - This last time i came in was the WORST.  I'm in a hurry, but wanted to surprise my bf for a couple pieces of pie and a tea for me.  No one was in line and this simple task should've only taken a few minutes. But not for this lazy guy...god forbid I interrupt your joking around to ask to spend money at your bakery & pay you a tip!  He even had another employee help by checking me out, yet he still took fooooorever & honestly, just rude. When I walked in, even though he saw me, he never acknowledged my presence, someone asked him to help and he still ignored it, I eventually had to just interrupt his convo, and he was purposely slow and lazy bc of that. I ask for the pies, and he eventually went to the back to get a new box of Togo containers, which would be completely fine. Except that he didn't realize I could see him through the swinging door, just laughing it up, leaning back and basically taking a break. 8 minutes later (yes, I timed it after I saw that), he comes back and instead of helping get out of there, he slowly starts to unload all the containers. And instead of cutting the pies with an actual knife, he uses a flimsy plastic knife, simply bc they were within reach...aaaaaand the knife kept breaking, so he kept reaching for more and more and running through at least 3-4 plastic knives!!! Just use a REAL serving knife?! Don't be SO lazy to not walk the extra two feet to reach it?! After this insanely long process, he then just puts the pies over the top of the counter without a thank you or even eye contact.  My hands are full and I ask for a bag, he ignores me, once again (not so shocking by now). I had to ask 3 more times and he is obvi annoyed that at me for putting him to such hard 'work'.  He eventually hands me a huge plastic bag where the pies just rumbled around and smeared all over the containers. And just to add insult to injury, after ALL of that, I open up the pies at home and his oh so efficient plastic knife skills gave me 1 suuuuuper tiny piece of pie AND the other was LITERALLY a half of a slice...just sliced horizontally across the middle. Like COME ON?! And I tipped you again?!  So to wrap this up, I'm sure the guy is a nice guy, he seems to get along and laugh with the other employees a lot. That's a nice quality to see, but just remember you're there to do a job. Joking around can take a pause to help your customers. His inefficient and complacent attitude just ruins the whole experience. I don't write this review to deter people to not try this restaurant, the food is truly amazing! That is why I gave 3 stars and not 1. But I wrote this review in hopes that either he may read it and learn to step up his game and how his lackadaisical attitude can effect more than just him...have respect for your bosses & their new startup restaurant. And if he never sees this, I'd hope that the owners/managers do and keep all their employees committed to good customer service.  Sadly, I will no longer be coming here...I would rather spend my hard earned money where it is appreciated.",

The potatoes were delicious, flavorful but not too salty with crispy kale. The scrambled eggs were rich and creamy and the bacon had a hint of sweetness. I don't usually order french toast but I had a craving for sweets. The toast was thick and the syrup was buttery and not too sweet. I can't wait to go back and try lunch and the bakery.",

    "text": "This place is going down hill fast. I come here pretty regularly for breakfast. The service is getting more rude and each dish I get is increasingly lower in quality, flavor, and temperature.   Service today was really slow and less than professional. When asked for my order, I ordered slowly while she was fidgeting with the register. After I was finished she said, \"OK! What was it you wanted again?\"  If you aren't ready, don't ask me what I want. Really rude and frustrating to think you're being heard only to have to repeat yourself.   Last time I was here I got their breakfast parfait. The fruit was less than \"fresh\" as they tout on their menu. The bread that came on he side was once warm and crumbled when I attempted to pick it up.   This time I got the breakfast sandwich. The potatoes were not cooked at all. Normally they are brown. This time, they were still white and incredibly greasy. The sausage on the sandwich was absolutely flavorless. The eggs were cooked too long and were served brown and crispy. There was hardly any cheese to speak of.   Oh, and don't even get me started on them if they have a line. They have two registers but do not use them. They will let the line get to the door with and still only use one. I've walked in and out a few times because they are incredibly slow.   If you want a sweet treat and there is no line, this is the place to stop in. If not, don't bother.",

They seemed to enjoy their meal. I ordered the chilaquiles. I didn't enjoy my meal. The chilaquiles was made with lots of tortilla chips, lots of green chili sauce, and a tiny bit of egg on top. I couldn't even tell if they used a whole eggs it was so little.  The chips were soggy and gross. I couldn't finish the plate because all it was, was a soggy plate of chips! Not worth the money I paid for it, needs more egg, a lot more egg.  The second time I went there, which was yesterday,  I had their chorizo plate. It was the same thing, lots of potatoes,  not enough chorizo,  and very very little egg. It had great flavor, but I'm not sure if I will ever eat here again with 2 disappointing plates. The coffee was decent though.",

I've only been there three times. Twice to meet a friend for coffee and once to get take out pastries which were amazing.  The actual experience was not so great. Since it is a new place, the staff should be a little more inviting. When you walk in the door for the first time, it's hard to tell if you are to seat yourself and a server comes over or if you are to get in line (and which side of the counter because there were people on both sides and cutting in front of people in the other line). The three times I went there were no greetings or acknowledgement from the staff-even if they saw us come in. I thought that was a little rude. Not a good first, second or third impression for a business that just opened in a community.  I will have to try the food sometime when they have had a chance to get their staff trained on common courtesy and customer service.   I always hate it when I either go to a place and love the food, but the experience was bad or if I hate the food, but the staff, experience and decor is cool.",

Pros..the food is delish. Especially the bakery items. Everything is gluten free, since I do not have Celiac I can say the cupcakes and bars are better than some of the white flower filled bakery offers in Phoenix. The place is locally owned and was opened with a purpose to support other families and provide options to the community. I love that. The service is good. I have never had an issue with orders or customer service. Cons....mostly selfish but it seems like they made their actually food menu smaller since they opened. I really like their food so I wish they had more to choose from, especially vegetarian. Be prepared to spend a bit more. It is probably more expensive to run a gluten free bakery so I will continue to support.  Basically you should go. Especially if you are skeptical of gf food and want to try a good representative.",

We had breakfast the first day and enjoyed the chorizo omelet, pancakes and breakfast sandwich. The second day we came back for lunch and had grilled cheese, a BLT and the buffalo chicken sandwiches all with fries. Both days we brought home baked goods including muffins, cookies, cupcakes and donuts to try. Everything was excellent and we'll definitely make this a regular stop when we're in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Let me first say I love Jewels. We eat here frequently and have never had poor service or poor food quality.   We went yesterday for Mother's Day brunch, and the experience was not good. We had a reservation, and we were seated promptly. The \"hostess\" had told us that when we were ready to order we could just go up to the counter and place our order. We went and stood in a very, very slow moving line and finally got up to the register, placed our order, only to be told they were out crepes (along with several other items on the special menu). We ordered something else, and coffee, and took out seats. After 10 minutes our coffee appeared and after another 10 or so minutes our food came out. According to the menu we were supposed to get a bread basket with herb butter to start the meal, but when we asked about it the server looked confused. She finally reappeared with some various dried up biscuits and pieces of miscellaneous bread in a bowl, with a little cup of cinnamon butter. We had to get up and go to the counter to ask for silverware so we could eat our lunch. While sitting and eating, I saw one of the staff come out and inform the front end people \"you guys know we aren't out of crepes, right?\". So since this was what I had originally ordered it was a little upsetting. I was going to let it go, but when the hostess girl came around and asked how everything was I decided to mention it to her. I was pleasant about it and just let her know it was a little upsetting. She literally looked at me and walked off saying nothing.  Not the best service or experience. The entire staff seemed very unorganized and overwhelmed.  I will be back, because I have been there on \"good service days\". I don't think I will go back on a holiday",

    "text": "$200+ worth of disappointment. Emailed w/Julie from Jewels over 1 month in advance, regarding GF order for a baby shower. I would need cupcakes, macaroons and also inquired about cake pops- I included a photo of the cake pops I was hoping to acquire. The pops were to be party favors for shower guests. Was told via email that all could be done- emails from Julie were brief and some questions left unanswered- but I didn't think it was that big of a deal. I went in to Jewels to place the order and pay, 1 week ahead of the party. The woman I spoke with was entirely unfriendly, even when I complimented how much my friends (whom the baby shower was for) loved her bakery due to Celiac dietary needs. No gratitude, no smile, no nothing during the entire interaction. I then told her I was looking for cake pops and received sighs, eye rolls, and verbal grief because \"making cake pops is just SUCH a headache\"... OK, well then Julie should NOT have stated they were an option!!! It is a bakery's prerogative to not offer a service for any reason- but don't tell me you can do something then make me feel guilty when I show up to order it, just because it's \"a headache\" for you- especially when I am paying you $70 for said request. I offered to remove the pops from the order and get them elsewhere, but she reluctantly insisted they could accommodate the request, including the custom design for the party theme- and asked me to leave the printout of how I wanted them to look (which I did). I paid $211 (cost plus an undeserved tip- stupid me) for 24 cupcakes, 20 macaroons and 20 cake pops- and I left the store feeling that there was zero gratitude for my business.  Fast-forward to the day of the party. Order was ready on time- great! When I opened the box containing the cake pops, I found they were not even remotely close to what I had ordered. For starters, they were poorly packaged (just set in a box, not individually-wrapped or secured in any way), and over HALF of the pops were broken- off of the sticks, cracked- and most of the faces were smeared, broken, or fell off of the pop altogether. I had to spend time repairing/reassembling the cake pops, individually wrapping, and doing what I could to salvage them for the party that was about to take place. It wasted my time, they were not the look or quality I expected, and they were not worth $70 or the attitude I received about them from the beginning in the bakery. I will say that the cupcakes and macaroon were good, as GF baked goods are not the easiest feat- and that is all that is earning Jewels the two stars this review has. We will not be back to this bakery- which disappoints me as I'd had high hopes. The ungratefulness and crappy attitude is really what did it for me, even more than how poorly the pops came out- at least they provided comedic relief after the party.",

I had had friends bring their baked good to me before, and they blew me away - I'd never have known they were gluten free, which is a common theme among their reviews. So, they already had that going for them. Also, they're just down the street from my house, so I had no excuse for not going in to try their traditional offerings. Wouldn't you know it, they have my favorite breakfast - eggs Benedict. I couldn't wait to try it. The presentation was very nice and traditional. It tasted great. It wasn't a Hollandaise, but still a delicious and creamy sauce. My one complaint is that the flatbread it's served on was rather dense and dry - a common issue for gluten free bread. Luckily, there was enough sauce and runny yolk to mostly compensate for this. I prefer classic style with an English muffin, but would definitely order this gluten free version again. The potatoes were also grand. It wouldn't be difficult to convince me to go back for brunch or just to grab baked goods.",

To start with, menus are kept at the register, so you stand there with people behind you quickly trying to make a decision while the unenthiusiastic cashier seems annoyed. I always get chicken and waffles, but my husband felt rushed.  We took our number to our table along with our coffee. They've done away with the raw sugar, so we used the white, but it did not improve upon the highly acidic coffee. We squeezed unto a wobbly table, trying not to spill coffee and juice and my food came about 10 minutes later. The food runner said my husband's pancakes would be right out. After 10 minutes I walked up to check on the missing pancakes. The runner looked annoyed and told me they'd be right out. Five minutes later he dropped off the pancakes. No explanation.  As I mentioned, the food usually makes up for the service. My waffles were gummy in the middle, as we're my husband's pancakes.  The chicken lacked the usual seasoning.  Sadly, I don't think we'll be back. At over $30 for breakfast for two, plus tip, it's no longer worth the drive.",

I took it to go and was in a hurry. The cupcake was very moist and tasted like a normal cupcake. I wouldn't know it was gluten-free. The bread is pretty good.  It is soft and has the texture of regular bread.  It was $8 as well. But it was a large loaf.  The customer service wasn't very good.  They didnt smile, welcome me or anyone i saw.  I kinda felt like I was bothering them just to order my food.  I might go back sometime for the bread, because it's very difficult to find soft gluten-free bread & maybe a baked good. But,  it's not worth the drive,  unless I'm already in that part of town. A big maybe!",

    "text": "My daughter's wedding cake from Jewel's cost far more than any other bakery would have charged in town.  Therefore, I expected perfection.  While the cake itself tasted amazing, the decorating was horrible.   When our event planner found out how much I paid for the cake, she was amazed of how poorly decorated it was.  She said it was very unprofessional looking.  It was a two layer cake with  vines up the side.  Whoever put the cake together, didn't even bother to make up the vines from one layer to the next.  The flowers on top of the cake were supposed to match the flowers for the wedding, but someone put basic frosting roses on top of the cake that could have been made by any armature cake decorator.    Bottom line, if you  want cake that tastes good, go to Jewels, but if you want your cake to be beautifully decorated for your wedding day, don't use Jewels.",

They have a variety of salads, waffles, sandwiches and breakfast items on their cafe menu. You can also order your food online and they offer cooking classes once a month. I ordered the delicious Santa Fe bowl along with a slice of pumpkin pie. It was a nice prelude to Thanksgiving and the customer service was awesome. I had an enjoyable dinner here and I look forward to stopping in for a pastry or one of their waffle creations in the future.",

So when I saw my sister ordered vanilla with buttercream I was nervous it wasn't going to be as good. If its possible it may have been even better! Thank you so much to whoever decorated this cake for me. It seems trivial and silly but this cake truly did bring me joy.

Upon arriving I really wanted to order three.. Of everything.. But my friend and I settled on an omelette with red potatoes, pancakes, a lemon bar, and a chocolate covered donut.. I was in heaven. It's been a long time since I've had a real donut..I usually just get those packaged-frozen-weird texture-somewhat edible ones in the gf section.   Everything was delicious, both the sweet and the savory. Seasoning-perfect, fluffiness and texture of the baked goods-spot on. It was.. A divine experience. The inside is cute with little tables and chairs and fun wall art. Everyone was very friendly and informative. Cost was pretty affordable as its a specialty bakery. The only problem is that it's in Phoenix and not Lincoln and I can't make it one of my local haunts.  If you're avoiding da glutzens in the Phoenix area, don't pass up this gem.",

    "text": "Very poor customer service experience with Julie, who I assume is the owner.   I found this bakery through yelp with the keywords \"gluten-free bakery\". I felt pretty comfortable making a last minute cake order for a birthday, based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.   Unfortunately, this was not the case. For the short version: Julie miscommunicated the hours of operation to me, and made some pretty rude remarks in the process of both ordering and picking up my cake (ie she told me I could pick it up on the doorstep).  My experience: I e-mailed Julie wanting a gluten-free butternut squash cheesecake. Julie emailed back saying it wasn't enough notice for that ingredient. There was no offer for a different service (for example, plain cheesecake), so pretty much was ok with not making a sale.  I acknowledged that my inquiry was last minute (2 and a half days notice), but being that she had such a great reputation for her gf products taste and quality, I was open to whatever options were available. I called the morning after our initial email from the night prior upon opening at 8am.  I called 3 times before anyone picked up, and Julie ended up answering the phone. When I began asking about types of cheesecake, pricing, and how many people each cake serves, Julie told me it was \"too early in the morning\" for this. This is extremely rude and unprofessional. I laughed it off, because I wanted a good cake for my husband's birthday that was gf. I live in the west valley, so I'm not exactly up the street from the bakery. I honestly asked basic questions, and she had plenty of opportunities to try to upsell me if she wanted, and she made me feel like I was an inconvenience, and not valued. Still, I ordered.  During our phone call, I asked twice if the summer weekend hours were that they were open until 7pm, and twice she said yes.  Now being the day I pick up the cake, my friend who works about 10 minutes from the bakery offered to pick it up for me. I told him everything would be ready by noon, and that they close at 7pm. He arrives at 3:15 and no one is there. He called twice, then went to the front to knock, and no one answered. I then call twice, no one answers the phone, so I quickly send an email obviously panicking. Julie calls me from the bakery a few minutes later and asks me why my friend didn't knock on the backdoor? SO incredibly ridiculous and rude. Is there a password I should have given him as well? Why would I even think of telling him to look for a backdoor? I remind her about our conversation about hours, and she says that's weird, because they haven't been open until 7 for over a year. I said that is weird, because you specifically agreed with me,  saying yes when I asked twice if you were.   So, I ask her to let me call my friend so he can turn back around asap and get the cake, and she says she can LEAVE IT ON THE BACK PORCH for him. Excuse me? I told her I was not comfortable with that, and she laughed!! I now am curious if she's actually being rude or is totally aloof when it comes to interpersonal skills. I am still just confused about how that was an actual suggestion by the owner. I picked you, I thanked you, and I was polite and thorough with you. How can you stand by such service? No apology, no accountability at all for your lack of professional conduct.  My friend ended up having to send one of his employees to pick up the cake, and Julie was not there to give it to her, but 2 men were there. They assumed it was me that picked the cake up, as they called her Gina. I literally said twice it was not me picking up the cake.   All in all, I got the cake which is why I'll give 2 stars instead of 1. So thanks (question mark??) to the 2 men who opened the backdoor to make that possible, but I will never return nor recommend this place to anyone. It was so unnecessarily stressful to accomplish what is supposed to be a specialty here. I work in this industry too, and this was an embarrassment. And for what it's worth, I did not find the quality in taste or execution.  **Final thought: I made a decision to not leave reviews for businesses anymore, even though the majority of mine are positive, because it's tough to see businesses attacked by pettiness, but I felt so wronged in this entire experience, and the lack of accountability by Julie, the owner was too upsetting to not share with other patrons willing to spend their time and money at a business that may not value it.",

However, there are just several issues that make me want to order out rather than linger over a coffee or bakery item.   While the service is friendly, it lacks training; for example:  I shouldn't have to flag the waiter down for a spoon, if I've said yes to cream and sugar in my coffee. I shouldn't have to stir it with a fork because I can't get anyone's attention and it's getting cold. Every time I have to remember to ask for a spoon.   The waiter might also offer a refill on coffee or come by and ask how everything is. The man that offers water is on top of refills! You might also ask him go around with a coffee carafe.   If I ask for salt and pepper, putting them together in a solo cup means I have to sprinkle your mix on my food, which means it gets over salted.   If I ask for toast, you might offer jelly if you're not going to put it on the plate automatically.   Little things that you can anticipate a guest requesting and offering before they have to ask make a big difference.   Otherwise, it's just too many cut corners that means I'd rather not deal with the peculiarities of your service.",

    "text": "I'd have to give this place 2 stars and it's strictly b/c of the presentation of my food. We ate here over the weekend and I was looking forward to it b/c of all of the good reviews, and my friend enjoys it. Being new (and my friends hadn't arrived yet), I walked up to the counter to look at desserts and possibly order dessert. Stood there for 2 minutes with no acknowledgement. A couple comes up behind me, & who gets acknowledged & serviced 1st? The couple. I ignore it and when they were I ordered a brownie. For a total of $4.34, that brownie was hard as a mf brick (didn't notice this until I got home). I even put it in the microwave thinking that would soften it and it came out a HOT brick instead of the cool brick it was previously.  Long story short, I ordered the chicken and waffles which is allegedly the best thing in the menu. It looked great but it was tasteless. The syrup and extra salt didn't help. To top it off, it made me nauseous that has lasted until today (it's Monday and we went for brunch on Saturday).   My friends liked their food so I'd go back, but will only have water",

The gal behind the counter was super helpful and very courteous. All the baked goods looked awesome, and the molasses cookie we finished our meal with was freakin amazing.   The Bad:  The pork sandwich. I never figured you could have a pulled pork sandwich that could be dry, but sure enough... The bun on this thing was a disaster, sapping all moisture and deliciousness from the pork. About half way through I discarded the top bun and it got better, but...chips on the side were just ok. Not a great sandwich by any means.   The Ugly:  The kale salad. Are you freaking kidding me? Giant, and I do mean GIANT pieces of kale with some vinegar dressing and beets and peppers. The beets and peppers were fine, but what the hell am I supposed to do with these sandal sized pieces of kale? No chiffonade, no nothing. Bizarre to say the least and inedible to say a whole lot more.   I am certainly willing to give this place another shot (perhaps for breakfast, perhaps a different sandwich) and the baked goods are a for sure, just avoid the kale salad at all cost.",

The only comment this coffee drinking crowd did think should be included were free re-fills for the price of the cup of regular coffee.  My dad was a bit unhappy with his French toast-but that was more due to his age (86) and not understanding why it wasn't the \"right\" kind.  It looked pretty delicious to the rest of the table. My niece even took home a lemon bar and a cupcake to enjoy later.  I'm dairy free and it was nice to be able to order a muffin and not worry as well.",

His gluten-free diet has helped to alleviate his symptoms; however, it leaves him longing for donuts, cookies, etc. This cafe is his new favorite spot to eat!! He was so excited that he could order ANYTHING on the menu!!!! He had the hamburger and we treated him to a rocky road brownie. He was so happy and wouldn't stop talking about how good everything was! The brownie caused him quite the dilemma as he lamented, \"It's so good, I want to eat it all up, but I want to eat it slowly!\"  The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable, making this a wonderful experience all around.",

It was delicious on any scale....GF or not.    I had the special 3 days in a row. I think it was called sweet hot pickle chicken.  That was the best thing I've had at a restaurant in ages (we tend to eat at high end places even).    My fav was when I had it with no bun and instead of fries I had the kale slaw.  My husband had a hamburger the first day. It was ok. Nothing special but totally ok.  My daughter had a grilled cheese with tomato and bacon and that was yummy. My son had the quiche 2 days in a row.  We all had pickle chicken the last day...and they didn't even laugh at us coming 3 days in a row!!! lol.   We had the buffalo cauliflower twice which we really enjoyed. Nice and crisp and not soggy like home!  My son had seen fried oreos at our state fair that he couldn't eat and Jewel's actually had them as a special! How fun.    We enjoyed the cupcakes and donuts also.    Thanks to Jewels I will be eating zoodles (veggie noodles) for a week now that I am home.   The atmosphere is also very cute/artsy.  We really really really appreciated the food and service!    I didn't catch names, but if you waited 2 days in a row on a family of 4 on 10/26 and 10/27, thank you very much! (we were there with different staff 10/25)",

Online there seemed to be lots of options for breakfast, so I was excited to give this place a try. I had seen french toast as an option and even saw a picture posted by someone else on yelp of it. It wasn't on the menu when we got there and when I asked, it was stated they didn't have french toast. So a bit of a bummer. The rest of the food was \"meh\" as well, nothing to write home about. Their coffee was good, but that it because it is brought in from Cartel. Overall, I had to give this place 2 stars as it was okay, but not a place we will be returning to again.",

After having many thing's off the menu and always giving it another shot, today's biscuits and gravy was the last straw for a while. The gravy was bland while adding so much salt, the potatoes had little flavor, and the biscuits were to hard to even cut with my fork. The atmosphere is great and I will give it another shot after the new year but my experiences continue to be no good. Hopefully other peoples experiences have been better than mine within the last year.

I ordered the chicken and donut which was super good. The chicken was crispy and juicy. When the waffle came, I was underwhelmed. I felt the seasoning on the hot chicken needed some serious salt. The syrup it comes with was so good. It tasted like honey and butter! I left with a salted caramel cupcake and will be thinking about that cupcake for days. So good. I did have a headache for the better part of the day and I think that may be from the overconsumption of sugar, which I don't think this place is short of! It's definitely a gluten free treat place for me! Not something I can have too often. But really happy to have it my neighborhood!",

Went there during brunch on a Sunday and I expected it to be busy since it was brunch on a Sunday.   Not sure if some workers called out that day or if just a bad day in general, but I always try to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt when it comes to operating. The staff overall was very un-attentive, the very young host was misquoting everyone by saying it would only take five minutes for a table when it really took about 20-30, no silverware on the table, waitress took our order after sitting for 10 or 15 minutes, and waited over 45 minutes without getting our food before we decided to leave.   It's a shame because I was really looking forward to trying them. Again I try to give all restaurants the benefit of the doubt but if this is how this place plans to operate, I find it very unlikely for me to actually go back.",

It's the perfect place to take a date with dietary restrictions.   The portions were gigantic! Although the price I paid for the vegan tacos was a little high for a lunch break, it is more than enough food for two meals. I can't wait to heat these up for a leftover breakfast tomorrow at the office.   I also had the buffalo cauliflower. I don't know about you, but this is my current favorite obsession.

Not only were we pleasantly surprised to find out they don't use soy oil but then we found out the pancakes and waffles are but-free! And when you visit a restaurant with people without allergy/food restrictions, they don't usually find anything tasty. Luckily that is not the case! The chicken IS all it's cracked up to be! They're syrup is like pure caramel! Macarons melt in your mouth! Fresh strawberry muddled lemonade or tea! We will definitely be back!",

So good. And their syrup!!! Omg if they bottled it I would drink it straight that's how good it is. Highly recommend going here.",

It was my younger brother's birthday and he has recently been put on a gluten free diet and it hasn't been the easiest transition. It was refreshing not having to have the \"you can only have these items\" talk.  Anyway, I ordered the Chorizo Breakfast Bowl which was a LOT of meat and just a little spicy while my brothers had the lemon pancakes and chicken & waffles. The pancakes and waffles had the perfect consistency unlike a lot of other \"gluten free options\" we've had, and the chicken was perfectly breaded.  Service was super casual but we still had everything we needed and our food/drinks came out fast- perfect for breakfast!   We will be back to try the $12 bottomless mimosas/ bloody marys :)",

They use local ingredients including Olive Mill and Pillsbury Winery.  I had the berry salad with seared ahi tuna, mom and sis had the quiche, nephew had burger and fries, niece's had veggie tacos and waffle with syrup. Everything was very good and very fresh.  I got my free cookie with Yelp check-in which led to a further purchase of goodies including a rocky road brownie and pecan pie square. I can't wait to taste them!!! I did nibble on the chocolate cookie on the way home. Yummers!  I will be back for sure.",

One of my coworkers raves about this bakery and special orders their gluten-free bread loaves several times a year and has them shipped. They're that consistently good!  Besides the special-order and bakery options (with a case full of GF, vegan, non-dairy, nut-free, etc cupcakes and cookies), they also operate a breakfast/lunch cafe- the whole menu is available the whole day, which allowed us to each eat our favorite foods.  The GF Chicken and Waffles is one of the best versions I've tried, GF or otherwise. That Sriracha honey is bomb! The AZ omelet is packed with veggies and served with roasted potatoes, surprisingly filling. I also really enjoyed the Grilled Veggie Shawarma bowl, but wish there were a soy tzatziki/cheese option to make it fully vegan.  Service was super sweet, our special order was ready when we arrived, and they offer a free cookie with Yelp check-in! The vegan snickerdoodle was soft, chewy, and just the right amount of sweet. Wish we had a Jewel's in Vegas, love how well they accommodate specialized diets while still serving up flavorful food at reasonable prices.",

We waited for a waitress no less than ten minutes. Ten minutes to place an appetizer order and get juice for my kiddo is just too long. Out order took at least thirty minutes to hit the table. The service was just terrible. I love the food, but I need service too. Especially when my four year old is with me.",

    "text": "I would avoid this place. We saw this place because of its social media presence and decided to try it out. Horrible idea. Started off with the live music they had playing was way too loud and the way they had him set up took up there entire bar top which was 10-12 seats. The host didn't greet us for about 5 mins then asked us how many. I could tell the place was kinda busy but a lot of tables where about to leave. After we told him how many he threw out a random number of 40 minute wait. He decided to wait, it only took 5 minutes to get a table. After we where seated we ordered right away and this is where it went really down hill. We waited for about 30 minutes with no sight of our server and our drinks empty before we went inside to get some service. In this time we saw a bunch of food coming out of the kitchen so the only thing I could think of is the server forgot to put our food in. After making contact with the sever she told us that the food would be out in 5 minutes. After waiting 10 minutes I went in side to talk to the manager to see what was going on. She said they where so busy and everything was backed up which I know was True because when we sat down most of the people in the place already had there food. She gave our table a couple muffins to \"hold us over\" till our food came out... finally after 45 minutes of waiting our food came out. Well most of our food. They brought of 3 out of the 4 dishes to us then another 7 mins later brought out the last one. Food was terrible chicken was bland waffle was really soggy and the potatoes where not cooked all the way. Would not recommend going here. We will not be back.",

They didn't offer to compensate us for our time and trouble or set up another table or create another reservation for later. So our entire group of 14 had to Uber to another restaurant for brunch.

I thought this would be a great place to come and eat well with my dietary restrictions- accommodating, friendly etc. Unfortunately, We had a very disappointing meal today. The service was very poor and very slow. It did seem like they were under-staffed, but there were issues beyond the pace of service. Per the menu's request, I let the staff member know about my allergies to dairy and gluten. For my side dish, I ordered a salad with no cheese/dairy and my salad came out with cheese on it. No worries. Mistakes happen. I asked for a new one, but I was returned the same salad with remnants of cheese that were left over from the hasty attempt to scrape the cheese out of the salad. Normally this wouldn`t be a big deal, but I couldn`t eat the salad with my allergy. I would have expected a place like Jewel's - a restaurant with a menu curated around a dietary allergy of gluten- to be a little more conscientious. Additionally, the high price point did not align with the quality of service and meal received today. I do think that Jewel's would be a great place to stop for a coffee and a gluten-free pastry, but I myself will not be returning for a meal.",

I'll be back soon for breakfast, especially after Jennifer the shift manager is going to the tables making sure the customers are happy. Great service trumps much for this YELPER.  I like this place. The decor made me think somebody loved collecting random chairs and opened a cafe so they could display them. Goldilocks would have a field day. This place is cozy but also urban hip with a dash of industrial. Chatty crowd here for a Friday near mid-day, gives a good vibe. For the neighborhood this little shopping center (40 Palms) is very nice. I've reviewed three great eats in here already.  They have full breakfast and lunch menus in addition to the off beat bakery selections.",

    "text": "Having gone gluten free and egg free two weeks ago I've been on a quest for places to dine that meet my dietary restrictions, and provide tasty nutritious food. I'm glad that Jewel's Bakery & Cafe was recommended to me.   Before visiting them, I visited their website. In addition to giving up glutens and eggs due to sensitivities, I have to balance my carbs and proteins so that each meal I consume has at least as many proteins as carbohydrates. I was disappointed that their website lacked nutritional information for their menu items, but that didn't deter me from visiting.   I arrived at around 12:30 on a Monday, and it thankfully wasn't terribly busy. The restaurant offered only counter service, but was pleasant with a fair amount of table space. The menu was Gluten Free, and had good variety, including breakfast and lunch items and desserts. My own options were limited by the number of menu items that had eggs in them.   An approachable young man was working at the counter, and helped me figure out which items contained eggs. I didn't really want a salad or sandwich, and decided to have the biscuits and gravy, and selected sausage as my breakfast meat. There were no high protein, low carb sides offered.  After ordering, I found a table, and watched the cutest little girl trying to take bites out of a sprinkle covered donut that was nearly as big as her face. She was pretty determined, so it made for interesting watching!   My food didn't take long to come out, and looked appetizing when it was set in front of me. The biscuit was good, although it wasn't the light fluffy sort. The sage sausage gravy was ok, although there was very little sausage or sausage flavor in it. The sausage patty was delicious! If I were to have the dish again, I would order an extra patty for the protein and for the flavor. The house potatoes were nice and crispy, but I only tasted them since they were just more carbs. The meal just didn't have enough protein to meet my needs.  In retrospect, I should have ordered the Classic Burger.   I'm certain that without my egg sensitivities, I would have loved this place. It is clear that a great deal of care and attention went into crafting the menu items - there were just so many that I couldn't eat. Not the fault of the restaurant. I have to go back again to see if I can find my groove there, and get a meal with enough protein in it.",

Upon being seated and waiting for about 10-15 minutes, I had to check with the host if we ordered at the counter or if we had a server. 1st time here and no one approached us so seemed legit that maybe we ordered at the counter.  He found our disgruntled server and we placed our order. More time past and a busser brings us water and my coffee. Have yet to see/hear from our server since ordering. I walked up to the counter to get a coffee refill. 45 minutes have gone by and we decided to leave. I came here for my boyfriends birthday brunch based on the recommendation of a foodie I follow on Instagram. I generally don't speak out like this so it's gotta be pretty bad for me to do so.",

For someone who is Celiac it's amazing to have a 100% Gluten free kitchen with things that I can't always find. (Like Fried Chicken and Waffles!) However, I've ordered sandwiches that were sooo different and varied so greatly in quality I think they need to do a better job of training and watching what comes out of the kitchen.  I will say the cakes that you can order are AMAZING. The head baker is so talented and I had one of the prettiest birthday cakes from here that did not taste GF at all!",

Waited a few minutes and I believe it was the owner or manager came out to us and said the entire patio is reserved for a private party and is not available. Which is interesting because my brother had called earlier to make a reservation but was told they don't take reservations. Hmmm. Interesting. When I brought this up to the worker, she stumbled through her words and said the reservation was in an hour so if we will finish our brunch in an hour she can sit us in the patio. We said fine. Reservation for this mysterious private party was at 12 noon. It was now just past 11 am. We were given a time limit for our brunch. Rude but whatever. Around 11:30 they sat a couple people out in the patio. Around 11:45 another group with a dog was also seated. But wait.. wasn't there a private party reserved for the patio at 12? That's why we were originally denied the patio but now all of a sudden other people were being seated there with no problem? We ended up leaving around 12:15 and guess what, no private party ever showed up. Not sure why the lies and why we were denied the patio originally when other people got seated no problem. The food was okay. Chicken and waffles was actually pretty good but because of the service I don't expect ever going back there again.",

I had their hot chick sandwich with onion rings and it was amazing. Spicy, fresh and cheesy sandwich on flaxseed bread! A perfect recommendation from Julianne! She was super helpful in my decision making for the perfect dish and desert! Such huge portions that half the lunch is packed to take home! Be sure to try the aioli garlic sauce for dipping your fries or onion rings in! Yummo!!! They also offer local honey and gluten-free flours so you can take home to make your own homemade goodies GF! I'll be back for sure! Just wish you had a location up in Cave Creek!",

    "text": "I would describe our experience here as \"meh.\" It was confusing when we walked in as a party of 4. There were several table available, but all of them were dirty? We found someone who was more than happy to clean one for us, but then we couldn't find a menu? Once we did find a menu, we all picked out what we wanted... Then to discover that they were out of half the menu. No lie, every item I asked for was gone, even a smoothie. How do you run out of smoothie? There was basically nothing available but egg entrees (which I can't have), and sugary pastries.  I settled on a granola parfait which was good, but it's hard to mess up granola, let's be honest. I was excited for tasty healthy food, but apparently you have to arrive well before noon to get that (we arrived at 12:30).  Once our food arrived (which took more than half an hour for granola, an omelette, and 2 thai flatbreads?), the omelette that one of our party ordered was fantastic, but the Thai flatbread was just ok, and the granola was good because it's granola. We had high hopes, but we're left disappointed by this place. In Arcadia, where consumers have no lack of choice, you have to step up your game. Maybe we were there on an off day? But with all the 4 and 5 star reviews we were ultimately left disappointed.",

Honestly, the food was okay - nothing spectacular.  The service was decent but it's the kind of place where you go up and order, and then they bring your food out to you.  I have other food allergies that I wanted to mention to them, but I felt really rushed because people were behind me.  I would definitely go again now that I know what I can eat - it's hard to find safe, gluten-free breakfast!",
