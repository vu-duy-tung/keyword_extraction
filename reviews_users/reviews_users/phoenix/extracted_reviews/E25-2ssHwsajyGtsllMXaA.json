Left us hanging! It wasn't until I told My husband what she had done that he got her attention and had to yell across the room that we were ready to order she right away looked at my like she knew what she did . She came to take our order and took my husbands first and then I ordered and she pretended i didnt say anything! She said \"are you going to get your order?!\" With and attitude I responded I had just told her my order she responded with a oh I couldn't hear you! And the food took forever to come out! Honestly I could care less about the food after all this crap! I wish yelp had a negative star review!",

You can almost glimpse the Phoenix of days gone by and it kind of makes you feel good to know something has withstood the test of time and the rush to make corporate eateries seem small time local (Postinos, the Yard etc.) This place is small time local and you can tell from the food and service.  Key things to note:  Menu is heavy southern fare - so come hungry Entrees are $13-15 including 2 sides Sandwiches are around $6 and have one side No alcohol Credit cards accepted You follow the golden rule and honestly report what you ordered when you pay They close at 7pm  My friend and I opted for sitting at the counter. Only complaint is the chairs were horribly uncomfortable. Being closer to the kitchen and staff you could see this is a family place and everyone takes care of each other. Staff was very pleasant. Bridget took good care of us.  Both our main dishes were delicious. One catfish and one fried chicken. The green beans were good as was the mixed greens.   I read some of the bad reviews on this place and most seem unfair or specific to one encounter. Do not go into this place expecting glitz or a modern slick feel that so many \"hip\" restaurants in Phoenix have of late. This is a family run establishment that serves old fashioned food. Respect who they are and what they are doing and you'll have a good experience. If not, go wait 3 hours for a pizza at Bianco's down the road.",

I think I am a bit biased though because I have had Sweetie Pie's (being as I'm from STL) so I know good soul food PLUS my aunt owns a bakery and is a awesome cook when it comes to southern food.   This place? Absolutely NOT! The meals should NOT be 15 a plate.. it's not worth it at all. People always put this place on a high pedal stool and I don't know why. Me and my BF decided to try this place on a whim and I was greatly disappointed. I got the smothered pork chops... cold, bland, and looked old. Let's not even get on the corn bread... super dry! I seriously don't think this place is worth 15 bucks a plate.   On the other hand Lo Lo's (DOWNTOWN location) it's GOOD! So good when my cousin was in town for a day I suggested this place of ALL places I know. And she is a harsh critic but she approved! I know for a fact she would not approve of this place. Neither do I.   Thing is... this place is owned by Ms. White and Lo Lo's is owned by I think her grandson or something so you would THINK the food and the way it taste would kinda coincide.",

We took 2 people who had never been there before with us & both said they can't wait to go back again.  Do not head there if you are in a hurry, good food & good friends take time.

Which was apparently from a brush the waiter put it in his mouth to prove it wasn't a hair  they brought the food it was way too salty and the macaroni in the mac and cheese was over cooked. They used cheese sauce and not cheddar cheese to my disappointment it resembled KFC Mac and cheese. I ordered a sandwich which ended up being just a piece of country fried chicken in sauce no bread. I asked the  waitresses if I could get the bread and she asked if I wanted bread or corn bread I enthusiastically said corn bread which didn't come ever until my friend went and asked for it. Which all together took about 30 minutes. All together the service was horrible the food not very good. I tasted the greens which were tasty.  Ultimately I was disappointed on top of that I got over changed. But I decided to just call it a night.   They didn't seem to care too much about anything.   I most likely won't go back again.

I've been bragging about this place to my family out of state for years....while the family was in town yesterday, we stopped in for lunch anticipating a wonderful meal.  There were only two booths seated when we arrived...the two young men that waited on us were pleasant and attentive, but the meal we got was just ok.  The moist succulent (fried) pork chops were not either.  Typically you get two nice bone in center cut pork chops that are juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  What we got were two chops (one boneless chop and one super thin bone in chop). One was tasty and one like jerky.  Sweet potatoes and greens were great, gravy on rice was watery and flavorless, same with potatoes and green beans.  Corn bread was served cold and chewy, not made that day.  Things have changed and not for the better....they have never been known for their service, but the food had been so good I was willing to overlook this.  I hope this was just a fluke and the once wonderful food returns soon!",

This place is an old, small, mom & pop diner, but the love in the kitchen is there.  Everyone was friendly, from the guy in the parking lot taking a break, to the wait staff, & even the cook came out to see how everything was.  The most fantastic, rib sticking, cornbread came with the meal.  We ordered catfish, green beans, mac n' cheese, smothered pork chops, gravy n' rice, fried okra, & a hot link.  Everthing came out hot, hot, hot & was delicious!  My boyfriend even finished my plate.  We will definitely be visiting again.  The food was 4.75 stars - I didn't care for my rice & gravy.  My only con of this place was the decor felt dirty, & the bathrooms were hot as hell.  I didn't mind the graffiti signed walls, it gives the place character & allows the patrons to participate in a little bit of history.  I can't wait to go back & try other items on their menu.",

I should have left when I walked in and saw the \"dining room.\"  And when I say \"dining room,\" I mean a dirty, take-out, greasy space with small tables that looked like they were thrown away by the public schools cafeteria.  But hey, at least I can say that I gave it a shot.",

We came into town from LA and Vegas for the NFL game and seen Mrs. White's cafe on Foodnet Work and knew the food had to be great. The chicken was great, but the customer service was so bad we will never return again.  We got a refill on our drinks and the guy poured sum of our drinks on the left overs so we could not take our food back to the hotel. Foodnet Work shame on you for recommending this place. Just because the chicken is good, does not mean you treat people like shit.   We had to remind the staff over six times to get our order. We waited over 40 minutes to get the other 3 pieces of chicken to finish our meal. We don't mind waiting but it was pretty rude when you are watching other peolple are getting their meals when they walked in after us. The Mac and Cheese did not look like everyone else's order- it look like it came out of a box. You can tell it was far from homemade, it cleary was not bake, no crust. The gravy was watered, missing favor. Corn bread was over cooked under salted. The cornbread sure as  hell did not look like everyones else's cornbread. I felt like we received the leftovers.   Truly the worst service we ever received. The place needs to learn how to be respectful and just be nice.",

    "text": "The topic of Mrs Whites would frequently come up in the office place by a coworker who used to work near there, at the New Times. This past week though it came up quite often, often enough that on Monday, when we were planning our lunch out together for Thursday, we were so hungry by talking about Mrs Whites that it only took until shortly after 11 for us to pile in her car and head out for some good ol' soul food.   I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful this place is. It's like walking into Grandma's kitchen and getting all those great meals you used to love and enjoy. My mouth was watering and my stomach was singing before I even had a chance to sit down.   I like that all the meals are the same price. It makes it so much easier. I also like the selection of sides and dishes. The red kool-aid was delicious but not in a mason jar like Lolos.  The staff was very friendly. One of my coworkers was craving ox tail and it started a big discussion between us and our waitress. She mentioned that Mr. Larry might know when it was available again (they were apparently out of it that day) and he even came out to the table to talk to us. My friend also then got his ox tail. I tried it. It's really damn good. I'd probably order it if it was available the next time I came around.  I went for the 3 piece smothered chicken (fried chicken and gravy) and red beans and rice. Wow that is a lot of food. I devoured the chicken fairly quickly. It was delicious. Best friend chicken I've had aside from my Grandma's. The red beans and rice I had to package up and bring home. I had them for dinner tonight and they were just as delicious as I imagined.   I also tasted one bite of the peach cobbler a la mode. Peaches are not one of my favorite fruits but damn did they do it right.   If you haven't been here, it's a definite must. I'm not sure why you're still reading this. Pack up and go. Move it.",

I got a to-go order of fried chicken, black eye peas and rice with gravy (since they were out of mac & cheese at 11:30 am). As I waited for my order, I watched several plates of chicken being delivered to customers eating in. The pieces were so huge they were half falling off the plates and towering above them. I looked forward to the same as I drove home, especially since I paid $14.81 for my lunch- and that did not include a beverage. Imagine my dismay as I opened my box at home and discovered three tiny pieces of underseasoned not-so-fresh tasting chicken. What the hell? You give the sit down customers the best you have to offer because they might complain otherwise? You give me some bullshit chicken because I am doing carryout? The peas were mush, the rice & gravy was bland, and the cornbread was overdone on the outside and heavy and underdone inside. I guess you're overcharging your customers to bank-roll your retirement, which will surely come sooner rather than later since I can't imagine how you're keeping customers.",

The collard greens--you'll want to slap someone for serving you greens that didn't taste like this.  They are a gift from on high, and the black eyed peas are insanely good.  Redolent with pork and seasoning, they trump any black eyed pea you have ever had.    Cornbread is grilled and isn't the dry, crumbly, cakey crap some places have the gall to give you, and the macaroni and cheese is soupy, cheesy and perfectly cooked, just like you wanted.  I saw plates literally overflowing with smothered pork chops and chicken, and if I hadn't been full to the point of a coma after eating all the chicken and greens and mac and cheese I could hold, I would have ordered some.  Or catfish.  Or neck bones.    Desserts offered by one of the ladies who cooks walking through the dining room going \"Who's gonna have peach cobbler?\".  Who??? ME!  That's who!  Peach cobbler...are you kidding?  Do people say no??  Meals are ONE PRICE, period, ($10.18 with two sides and cornbread)and you better bring cash.  The lemonade was excellent ($2.37).  Oh my god, what wouldn't I have given to be a cow, with four stomachs.  It's worth going back to Phoenix for.  Stop here before you drop off your rental car.  You'll thank me.  So will your cardiologist.",

There isn't much that I can add to the other reviews, except that I have actually called Mrs. White's before holiday potlucks and had them whip up some extra cornbread for me to take. They always seem a little tickled at the request, but have never refused and it allows me to focus on the festivities (not to mention everyone expects it now).  If you are looking for really good food in a unique and relaxed setting Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe should not be missed.",

Boy o Boy was I VERY disappointed.  I did not find the chicken good at all, service was slow and the plates came out one at a time minutes apart.  It was Friday night 10/21/11 abt 9pm and they were out of a couple of dishes.  When I think of Kool-aid (growing up Black) i think of it as flavorful and to be honest, a little too sweet. It was neither.  I had the chicken with sweet potatos and cabbage, the cabbage looked nice but was, oh so bland, i did like the sweet potatos.  To be fair let me tell you what my boyfriend and daughter thought...they LOVED the chicken.  So to each his own, they are not writing this review.  I would not go to this place again",

If you like southern aka food, this is the spot. It is 100% authentic.  My favorites - anything on the menu.  The collard greens are perfect.  The okra gumbo is perfect.  The fried chicken, plain or smothered (in gravy) are perfect.  The pork chops are perfect. Just don't tell my Rabbi I said that. ;)  The catfish is perfect. DOn't tell my Rabbi about that one, either, mmkay?  The cornbread is perfect.  The red beans and rice... perfect.  Starting to see a pattern here?  A few tips:  Get there early. They start to run out of stuff if you show up too late.  You can order a meal and then things by the piece. Like, order the catfish and a chicken thigh or something.   They don't have soda. They do have tea. Sweet tea (already sweetened - too sweet for me but very authentic southern) or unsweetened.  Order extra cornbread. It comes with the meal but you'll thank me.  If you don't have room for dessert, get it to go. The peach or whatever cobbler they have is kick ass, as is the bread pudding.  You will get seated and then order. They don't bring a bill to your table, you go up to the counter when you're done, tell them what you ordered, and pay there. That's why it's called the 'Mrs Whites Golden Rule.' Make sure to leave a good tip. They deserve it.  Being a regular will get you better service, but you aren't going there for the service. You're going there to eat.   There's a good chance you'll spot some Phoenix sports stars. I don't know who they are because I don't follow sports, but you can pretty much pick em out.  They are only open for lunch.   That's pretty much all you need to know. Bring your friends or coworkers, enjoy, and plan to endure a 3 hour food-induced coma when you're done.",

It was good, but really needed to douse it in hot sauce to really enjoy it.  My husband ordered the smothered pork chops only because they didn't have any fried chicken available.  I was really bummed since the fried chicken was really all that I wanted.  Service is friendly and fairly quick.  On our second visit we had the fried chicken.  I'm hoping our first visit was a fluke because the flavor and crunch on their fried chicken is to die for! We also ordered oxtail, which I had only ever tried served in a peanut butter stew (Filipino dish).  Don't let the looks fool you.  Their oxtail is so flavorful and tender.  Deelish!  For sides I had rice with gravy and greens.  You have to order the greens as a side!  I think it compliments any of their entrees.  My husband was disappointed to find that they were out of okra on this visit.  It seems that there is always something not available when we go.  I'm not too bothered by it.  I think of it as someone's home kitchen.  You eat what's available and it's almost certainly going to be comforting and delicious.",

I go to the front door and it is locked. I go back to my car and the guy peeling potatoes is gone. I drive around to try to find another restaurant that's open. I can't find another restaurant that's open so I wind up coming back to Mrs. White's. They are open now and I go inside and take a seat at the counter. No one is inside, no customers nor employees. A waitress comes from the back and takes my order. I ordered chicken fried steak it takes a long time to come out and when it does it go to someone else. There's a mixup and the waitress said that she can make my steak in  just 10 minutes I agree to the additional 10 minutes. I asked for a soda and and and informed that they do not sell sodas anymore. Only lemonade and Iced Tea that they make. I asked for a pepper based vinegar sauce that they used to have and they no longer have it. She finally brought my chicken fried steak up and it was very soggy like smothered steak. When I was done with the meal I was brought  a piece of cornbread that look like a golden nugget and was as hard as one. Literally, it was crystalline and you could have cracked a tooth on it. It looks like Mrs. White's has been sold to someone else and management and the employees and the cooks have changed. It's not the same as it used to be. Go and find out for yourself but I think it went downhill.",

The menu was written on the wall with magic marker and their signatures from happy patrons all over the walls. I have been going here for years and I must say that the service has improved drastically and they now also take credit cards which is a plus. I love all of the sides so much that I always order the vegetable plate which consists of as many of the side items as will fit on one plate.  From fried chicken to smothered pork chops to chicken fried steak- it's all delicious.  The cornbread is also outstanding and if you somehow have enough room you can enjoy one of their amazing desserts or give it to go and enjoy it later after you're done with your food coma.  The sweet tea, lemonade, and super sweet koolaid are excellent for washing down the food.   The transportation and parking situation is a little challenging due to the close proximity to the light rail and the congested downtown area. If you can score a parking spot in their small parking lot that is the way to go. The lunch rush can be difficult and time consuming, but it's worth it.",

My significant other and I had Mrs. Whites Monday night. He was craving something filling and filling, I wanted Mac and cheese.   On a Monday there were about 5 couples dining, including us. I ordered smothered chicken with Mac and cheese and green beans win potatoes. It came with 3 huge pieces of chicken. He ordered ox tails, sweet potatoes, and rice and gravy. Both dishes came with cornbread. The ox tails were cooked to perfection, very little fat, very meaty. OMG!!! Delicious!! I've probably had Mrs. Whites only 3 times since I've been in the valley (almost 3 years). It's definitely something you shouldn't be eating all the time, but when you want some go ole fashioned, filling soul food. You better head to Mrs. Whites.",

The cornbread has the consistency of cornbread that had been microwaved wayyyy too long. The fried chicken was good seasoned but not a lot of salt. The Mac N Cheese was good also. Overall I will go back and try their pork chops I know I wont be disappointed. I recommend for sure. You have to try the kool aid lol",

I use to stop in here several times a year when working in the downtown area.  Today I opted for the same dish I use to always get: Catfish, rice w/gravy, and green beans w/ potatoes.  Just as good as I remembered and what I was hoping for.  Portion sizes are smaller than they once were but are now a perfect portion size for a full meal. Catfish had a good crunch with the fish still being moist and tender. The gravy could use some more salt & pepper but the green beans with potatoes were great.  Decor wise: this restaurant is about as simple as it gets. Plating is also simple but has improved over the years. The real star here is the food as it should be. Highly recommended this Phoenix staple when in the downtown area.",

The chicken fried steak was also good but nowhere near the rest. Sides are fresh and just about everything is a good choice but the sweet potatoes were addictively awesome.   Servers were very attentive and friendly. I did get a weird feeling when paying after getting absolutely no response to signing the credit card slip and leaving a 20% tip. The gentleman who seemed initially full of smiles very obviously examined the tip line then set down the slip and gave us no further acknowledgement as we turned away and left. It just felt weird and was an unfortunate closing experience.",

This place is a hidden gem, awesome home cooking type would food. If your looking for awesome service with an aesthetically pleasing decor this is not the place. With that said, our server was very polite and attentive despite what some of these other reviews on Yelp have said about the service. Our food came out in a timely manner, especially for items like these that are cooked to order. The fried chicken was fantastic, and authentic to a home cooked soul food meal. The sweet potatoes were great, not too sweet with just a touch of cinnamon and brown sugar flavor. The Smothered pork chips were awesome and my pregnant belly was very very pleased with them! The green beans were also soul food style green beans and exactly what I wanted and would have expected. The mac n cheese was also great, again home cooking soul food style. All these reviews on here that complained about the food looking like slop I think is just silly and clearly they don't understand what home cooking soul food looks like. This is a hole in the wall mom n pop place. Soul food isn't particularly aesthetically pleasing food so to expect it to look like a trendy restaurant in old town's food would look is just silly. Close your eyes and taste the food if you need your food to look like something off of top chef. I enjoy a fun trendy restaurant as much as the next foodie but I also enjoy a hole in the wall mom n pop and this fits that bill. The amount of food you get for the price is awesome, if you think this is pricey then I guess you should stick to the fast food dollar menu. Oh and the kool aid and corn bread was on point as well! We will be back!",

Known for its Fried Chicken, on my first trip I asked the Counter Waitress (very helpful by the way) what she suggested and she said \"The Pork Chop.\" Well I came for the Fried Chicken so she suggested a \"Combination Plate\" with both. Glad she did!  The Pork Chop, thin and apparently pan fried was absolutely TERRIFIC! If I could have, I would have eaten the bone! Obviously a combination of coating and temperature, which is able to partially caramelize the small amount of fat on the Pork Chop, make it delectable. The Fried Chicken was a bit of a disappointment on both occasions. NOT the best I have had and honestly, I could almost do as well at home. Additionally, the breast piece (on both occasions) was anemic without much meat and skin. Sides? Mac and Cheese and the Cabbage are addictive. The best? CORNBREAD! Wonderful, hot, full of flavor and no butter is needed.  NOT a bargain at $13 without a drink for lunch (they are only open until 7 PM) but lots of choices besides the Pork Chop and Fried Chicken.",

Normally I check my order before leaving anywhere but they put all 4 of our boxes in the same bag so I didn't get to check the food.

They asked the people who packed the orders if they forgot my side as if they didn't believe me and didn't even apologize all they said is \"oh ya you can come get it\". So me and my co-worker went back to go get the side and she ran in and I stayed outside with the car running. She said the lady in the front was extremely rude and rolled her eyes.

    "text": "Went back today and took out another 10 vehicles as I rammed into the left lane to make the turn into the lot... I meant to try pork chops, or catfish...nope, I couldn't get past the chicken. Once again, this chicken did not disappoint.  I had an annoying end to this long work day when I got home with this chicken.  But as soon as I picked up the drumstick and took a bite, it ALL washed away...seriously. Let's back up.   When I opened my styrofoam container, I noticed that the chicken had gotten slightly moist from the being closed up for almost an hour after I got it.  I thought the experience was going to be lessened.  No.   The drumstick was a bit soggy on the bottom from sitting so long, but like I said, I bit into it and all the annoyances of life went elsewhere and bothered some other guy. Perfection. Even when soggy. Even when sitting for over an hour. If fried chicken remains absolutely delicious even after all that, you know you've got some special stuff. What gets me is that I saw some young folks in the kitchen, I don't know if either of them fried the chicken, but if so - someone has been teaching them the real deal.  This tastes like some old woman who has been through years of hurt and pain but also joy and love has cooked this.  Someone who KNEW what bad chicken was and KNEW how to avoid that at all costs.  Someone who cared what their food tastes like.  And if youngens' are producing this kind of fare, that deserves proper kudos. I notice there is not a 'professional' atmosphere here.  Like another reviewer said, anything seems to go.   Honestly?  So what. The food is too friggin good.  Yes, we are entitled to good customer service as customers.  But like I said before, you get what you put in with the people here.  You come in with an attitude, that is what you get. I know some people put a high high value on customer service and how staff presents themselves; I do, too.  But chicken THIS good, and I mean specifically THIS chicken that is THIS good...I can accept the very casual atmosphere here. Yes, I wish they would put a bit more pride in their professionalism.   But I promise you, this chicken will make lovers of fried chicken not give a flying flea's fanny about anything else.  In each experience I've had with it, the chicken is THAT good.",

    "text": "Okay, I was born in southern Indiana and my best fried chicken originates with the aunts, grandmothers and mom who knew how to cook fried chicken!  This chicken reminded me of some of the best I have ever tasted.  The porkchop was VERY good also (I had the combo meal) and my cornbread, redbeans and rice, and the sweet potatoes were all quite good.  Service was polite, quick and attentive.  The sweet tea was refilled several times and on time, and overall I enjoyed the meal.  In read with interest some of the recent 'poor' reviews and have to assume that they just have good days and bad days...hard to say, but I was definitely here on a good day.  I hope you experience is like mine and if it's not...sorry, but they CAN do great chicken!!",

    "text": "Where to start?   Let's start by addressing the False advertising on their website.  After hearing a few people talk about how good the food is there , we wanted to give it a try.  We viewed their website and if you look under Entrees, you will see the meals are all priced at $10.18 per plate.  Good deal!   We arrive at the place and our first impressions are, the place needs cleaning and a paint job.  Most anyone can look past how a place looks if the service is great and the food is really good.  Most dive places I've been to have both... so the decor isn't something I get hung up on.   Service...  marginal at best.  Some guy... guessing the owner... arguing with the staff, singing... just doing whatever.  I guess this is acceptable since he owns/runs the place?  Not the best thing to do in front of customers. (again... it's a dive... not expecting 5 star services)  Server---  stops my wife in front of the bathroom door to ask if she knows what she wants to order.  Maybe wait until we are all seated and ready to order?  Thought this was pretty strange!   Now the food comes out.  Chicken wasn't horrible, wasn't great.  The canned mac-n-cheese... right up there with the best High School cafeteria mac-n-cheese.... not good!  Right from a box or can... no flavor... not homemade.   Very disappointing to say the least.  The greens... again... from a can... maybe some additional seasoning added... but.. odds are... if they were too lazy to make real mac-n-cheese... then they were too lazy to make real greens.  Gravy on the chicken... same sad story... from a box/can.... just not good or great.   Dessert--- sweet potato pie   not bad... probably one of the better things ordered.  What was crazy... if you can imaging this... take a normal/decent size slice of pie... now cut that in half and this was the serving size we got.  All for $4.99 a slice. NUTS!  $10 for two slivers of pie. A joke!   Remember I mentioned the FALSE ADVERTISING at the beginning of this review.  All meals $10.18.  NOT TRUE!  The site hasn't been updated in who knows how long?   You sit down and the menu does not show the pricing... only mention of pricing is the Ox tales for $15.00.  So... you would assume from the website the meals are $10.18 each.  WRONG....  for  two meals, two very sad/small slices of pie.... $41.00   No breakdown of the pricing ... the owner/manager just punched up some numbers on the calculator and that was the bill.   All in all... this place needs new management... some passion put back in to  the kitchen... and they need to update/clean the place.  Not to mention... in this day and age... no excuses to not having an updated website.... to properly reflect your business and pricing.  I have a feeling when Mrs White was running this place... it was awesome... not anymore.   Bad experience.. not even close to being worth the money spent. Avoid this place...save your money....  Will not be going back... will not recommend this place to anyone I know.",

Ordered the chicken, with black eye peas, mustard mixed greens and fried okra. It was great, food was really hot and the server was good. The server Carlos came around often asking about drink refills, I even inquired about the Oxtails which I have never had, they brought out a sample and it was really good.I'm not sure why there are numerous 1 or 2 stars but I thought the food was good. The building has been around for a long time and not modern but it doesn't matter when the food is this good. At least my opinion!",

    "text": "We drove all the way from north Scottsdale to try the legendary peach cobbler and voted best in the southwest southern comfort food. Server was a nice man who immediately greeted us and got our drink order. Wail waiting for our order to be taken we looked around the restaurant and noticed countless awards and magazine articles about the wonderful southern comfort food and we thought we had gone to the right place. Sadly all three of us received meals that made our tummies turn. Poor Mrs white would turn in her gave if she new what had happened to her souther food dream.The chicken sandwich is two pieces of small wings that is over breaded, dry, greasy, mostly bone fried chicken put on some dry bread with a side of your choice. Who put chicken wings on stale bread and calls it a sandwich? And the fresh caught catfish is a breaded and deep-fried disaster. The Mac and cheese was okay but could have been microwaved longer and the sweet potato were tasty but very sweet. However the black eye peas were a gummy mess and the cornbread was very disappointing and covered in grease. Not to mention wail eating the employees were cleaning around us, sweeping dust up, cleaning with dirty mop water, and washing their hands in the sanitizer water gross. However we decided to still stay and try out the peach cobbler that was award winning. Hahaha it was the worst soupy mess we had had. The dough tasted like undercooked frozen dumpling that was then covered in can peach soup and heated in the microwave. After all that the total came out to 50 bucks and 10 to the server not a meal worth 10. This place might have been good at some time but the reviews are very outdated. It is sad to say that the Kool aid was the best part of the meal.",

    "text": "Sorry, I see some \"rave\" reviews but this place was not even up to \"Dive\" standard for me.  I had been by this place, read reviews, was so excited to try it and finally got a chance to go in and eat...so excited...and then, SO DISAPPOINTED! Went there during a Diamond Back's game, no one in there except one gentleman sitting at the barstool waiting for his order.  Got in there around 1:12 p.m., and we didn't get our food until 2:20. So wanted to leave but we felt uncomfortable leaving when we had already ordered, I had waited so long to try it and we were the only one's in there for the last half hour...awkward.  We could not believe it took over an hour to get our food, AGAIN, we were the only one's in there for over a half hour! We ordered the chicken and it came with two sides and a piece of cornbread. The cornbread was so dry my 9 year old niece almost choked trying to force done a small bite.  I didn't believe her so I tried, it was so dry I put it down without finishing; note to restaurant, YOU CANNOT microwave corn bread back to life!  I will say this, I did finish it only because I was waiting over an an hour for food...it became a \"eat in hunger desperation\" thing.    Once the food finally came, and AGAIN, still the only customers (that should have been my tipoff...UGH), it was not impressive.  The chicken was nothing special, nothing.  I make better at home.  The side of Mac n'Cheese was good and thank goodness something was good...not great, just good.  I had the green beans, again nothing worth remarking that another restaurant could not do.  I don't know if it was just because I was so hungry or whatever, I ate all my green beans and Mac.  Nothing spectacular, and nothing I will ever go back for.    Service was horrible, they were not even ashamed of the crap service, didn't even bother to give us another piece of dry-arsed corn bread and only checked on us once.  I went, I ate and was NOT impressed.    Go, judge for yourself.  Sadly, I know you will probably be disappointed.  You will have an appreciation for the expression \"Meh.\"  They are over-priced and over hyped.  Glad I got it out of my system.  I could give them more than 1 star but that would be dishonest.",

I decided to try this restaurant out today after visiting an historical church for Sunday service, that is right across the street.    As I walked over to the restaurant, I got giddy inside thinking that I would be welcomed by absolutely amazing down home soul food that I have experienced in Harlem, Houston, St. Louis, New Jersey, and even Philly, but I was not.  I knew that the ambiance was not going to be upscale, which is fine with me, but the food is not as exciting as the previous reviewers make it seem.  Maybe my taste buds are a little too snobby, but like I said I have had amazing soul food in other places, not just the South.   Moving on, I had the fried chicken, mac n cheese, black eyed peas, cabbage, and corn bread.  I must say that the black eyed peas and corn bread were pretty good, but the cabbage lacked lots of flavor, and so did the fried chicken.  Also the fried chicken was very salty, but lacked flavor, which to me is a little oxymoronic.   The waitress/waiter were very nice.  I will not go back because I do not feel like the meal was worth the $13.00 plus tax.  I will go over and try Lo-Los Chicken and Waffles soon and hopefully there, I will find delicious soul food that I left behind on the East Coast in New Jersey, NY, and Philly!",

I had the smothered chicken and regretted it immensely - fried chicken covered with gravy amounts to a mess of watery breading.  Between that and having to dig through the mess to find the bones, it wasn't exactly a lot of meat down my throat.  Mac & Cheese and white rice as my sides were good.  The ambiance?  There IS none.  I found more entertainment from the writing on the wall, which had clearly been painted over MANY times since the 60s, and the open/close sign which reads, if closed, to contact \"Jesus\".  LOL.  Unaware of the church across the street, I arrived right after Sunday services to find the place fairly full - some churchgoers, at least one newcomer party, and several regulars.  Based on the caloric content of the entrees, I wasn't surprised to see about 50% obese customers, while the rest were inexplicably thin.  As a Whitey, I can't say that I was comfortable.  Clientele is almost all Black and while they are some of my best friends, I only felt welcome because of the cordial words spoken by our waiter and the cashier at the checkout, who clearly could have beat the crap out of me with one punch.  Other than that, there were a lot of \"what are YOU doing here?\" looks from fellow customers.  I kept wishing I had brought my sista friend with me, who would have loved this place.  I'd go back, but it's not a perfect choice.  Perhaps on a Saturday when church hadn't just let out.  Also, the price is extreme - it's almost as high as Knott's Berry Farm which gives you more food for only about $2 more, and that's at theme park prices.  This is just dumpy outskirts of downtown..but again, I don't wanna judge.  I love small business and I'm proud of Mrs. White for making it this long; hope she continues for a long time to come.",

Two starched white guys both formerly from Texas made the suggestion.  One black dude formerly from South Carolina, and me a Hong Kong Chinese who grew up in Detroit.  Quite a foursome.  We stumbled into this place near downtown while the sun was still up.  Very spartan diner with counter and a few tables.  Sharpie autographs on the wall from the famous to the not so much.  It was near closing time because we ordered and ended up being the only ones in the place when food arrived in a trickle.  I had the fry chicken with collar greens and mac cheese sides.  Wonderfully crunchy and moist inside chicken.  Sides were perfect just like my childhood friend's Mom use to make.  My buds went for the steak fried chicken and two had the fried pork chops.  I only need to say that all plates where cleaned out.  No booze.  The ice tea had me worried, but I was told its made from Phoenix's famous tap water which is full of minerals.  The was the only downside.  Don't know but if they are okay with BYOB, If so, I will return someday from San Francisco.  Recommend this place if you need a soul food fix near downtown.

The food was good but the only problem is if you go two hours before closing time they will be out of most (if not all) of the side dishes and desserts, which is very odd. You rarely find it crowded (except maybe on Sundays after church) so it seems as if they would rather have less sides or just enough than too much. I can't imagine a restaurant constantly \"running out of food\" all the time.  It took us about 45 minutes to get our food and only after the waitress told us every 15 minutes they had no more mac and cheese, then no more sweet potatoes, then no more greens.   The chicken was very good and so was the cornbread, but I've been here several times and the service is the same.  As we were looking to pay our bill the owner (or someone related to Mrs. White I assume) was on the phone talking to someone about going out that night, over charged us, swore we owed more than we did (all the while he's still having a conversation on the phone) and when we finally told him he over charged us he just said \"oh\".  The food isn't enough to make up for the service and vanishing dessert and sides options, so I think I won't be going back.",

However, when we went to pay we were stuck standing there for about 10 minutes until an older gentleman finally came out and barely said a word to me. He pulled the receipt and tossed it at me without saying a word. I signed it only to make sure the waiter got his tip and the man tossed my copy at me the same way. The man was incredibly rude and i will never ever return. Ill stick with lolo's.",

    "text": "Been wanting to try Mrs. Whites for some time with all the great reviews. Very friendly folks with super service was a plus but sadly the food was just ok and not worth the price. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak which was tender and had a nice light coating of Gravy. It was good but not great and lacked a little flavoring or at least some salt. For sides I opted for the green beans with red potato and the Mac and Cheese. The Green Beans were directly from a can with the same juice with a crushed red potato, again no flavor or spice, really? The Mac and Cheese was a huge disappointment having had better at a Walmart Deli. I wish my phon battery was not dead as the tiny slice of stale cornbread made me chuckle, exactly 1 inch by 1.5 inch. :)  $15.86 for a lackluster meal is not what I was expecting nor would I go out of my way to go back, even to see the happy waitress.",

The skin was seasoned perfectly and crispy so I made sure to get a bite of that in with every piece of meat.  The mac-n-cheese, mushy and not very tasty. The potato salad, yums!! Very good on that mix. And the corn bread, how disappointing. It was dry and tasteless. I was really looking forward to it too because corn bread and soul food, hand in hand right?? Not so much here :-\\  I wanted to try Lolo's up the street but I think they were closed for construction or something.

We ordered it came out in a reasonable time except for my chicken I ordered, that came out just as I was almost finished with my meal. Yes I ordered everything together with my initial order. We had to wait for silverware. Our drinks didn't get refilled until we were about finished. We was offered cornbread as we was about finished eating which was not good at all! Mac n cheese tasted just like stouffers. Greens were bland. Yams were good. The fish was ok. Chicken was over fried and bland. The koolaid was really good.

Not only were everybody else in my table served the two tables that came in after us were served before them and it wasn't until pointed out that they had not brought me my food yet I finally received half of my order. When we went to pay we had to stand by the front counter for someone to come to us timed for 8 minutes. and when she came out she asked if we were looking for a check then walked by us to continue to talk to other people's she seems happier to have at her establishment. Racism is wrong and while it felt that was the motivation maybe they will chalk it up to a bad day but it felt personal. Because of their actions I'll never go back and I hope others will be aware",

Sooo... the food.... BEST GREENS EVER, if they'd sell me a bathtub full I'd be a happy, happy girl, but alas, best I can do is 3 sides. Chicken fried steak, fried chicken, Mac and Cheese, . The smothered pork chops and ox tails are superb, come early for the ox tails, they go fast.  The cobbler is delish, and sweet potato pie (special) are the best, but get them to go for later because you'll be too stuffed to enjoy them after your meal.  The guests are always the best, it's a small place, but a social fun atmosphere if you're not a tool....just be nice, and you'll get nice, just like the rest of the world...easy peasy....DELICIOUS, go, you'll love it, just wear your jeans or shorts, it's that kind of place, and we like it that way....",

We were greeted promptly enough there were only two other patrons in the restaurant was there about 5 on a Wednesday afternoon. I asked the server if they were out of anything before I ordered, she said no. I then proceeded to ask what kind of pie they had and was told they were out. We were served a plate of two pieces of cornbread and then proceeded to order our meal. I ordered chicken fried steak with black eyed peas and fried okra my friend ordered Fried Chick'n, black-eyed peas and potato salad. We also ordered two ice tea's one regular and one sweetened. It sounds good so far doesn't it.?  Here's where things started to go wrong, the corn bread was tough and chewy and struck me as something that was put in the microwave. Both Iced Teas had somewhat of a \"woody\" taste which told me it was either old tea or the teapot needed to be cleaned. When I was served my meal, the waitress told me that the okra looked the way it did because somebody had left the freezer door open, my okra was served in 3 smash down lumps. While I was eating my dinner which I should say the chicken fried steak and they Black Eyed Peas were pretty good. Another waitress came over and leaned next to me and asked if she could taste my okra, yes she asked for a bite of my food. I proceeded then to pick up one of the clumps of okra and give it to her which she ate and walked away. (Who does that). My friends meal was pretty good but the Fried Chicken was a little dry and tough. The same waitress also told us a little bit of history about the restaurant which was nice but then also what the restaurant purchases as opposed to making homemade.  I have been to Mrs White's on numerous occasions, and found it to be pretty much hit-or-miss so I'm not disappointed when I go. No expectations.",

It would have been enough to go through that but rather than pushing through, at one point 4 of the staff were out chatting with customers at the counter while several of us still didn't have our meals.  What we got tasted great but it certainly feels like they have gotten too comfortable with their reputation and I wonder if that is coming out in their lack of customer service.

One of the people in my group only ordered Mac and Cheese. We all received our food but they didn't bring her Mac and cheese. We waited another 15 minutes and asked three different people for the Mac and cheese before receiving it. Also, two of the guests had a side of red beans that was not brought out with their meal. We asked all three employees at least 2-3 times for their red beans and rice. Finally one order was brought out but not the other. So then we had to wait even longer for the second order to come out. This was after asking another 2-3 times about the red beans.   If I ever eat here again, I'll see about calling ahead and ordering for takeout. Like I said, the food was delicious.. I ordered the vegetable plate and it was amazing. The service just made this a miserable experience though.",

    "text": "This is easily the best southern-style food in all of Phoenix. I've been here close to 10 times now and there is absolutely no doubt that it's the best.   I've gotten the chicken fried steak, smothered chicken, pork chops, and catfish before and you absolutely cannot go wrong with any decision.   With that said, you are coming here for the food, not the venue or the service. The venue is clearly old school, but I think they've avoided changing anything to keep in touch with their historical roots in Phoenix. To my knowledge, this place has been here for decades.   The service can be a hit or miss. There is a chance you will end up with a server that you'll never see again after you get your food so if you want to get something else or just get your refill you'll be out of luck. However, that is not a reason to not check this place out! I'd highly recommend it just based on the food alone!",

    "text": "I honestly don't know how anyone can rate this restaurant more than 1 star.  We saw this restaurant featured on Check Please Arizona and being from the south, we were excited to try it.  I decided to take my husband there for his birthday.  Let me start off with the review of the food - it was terrible.  The chicken was greasy, and had no flavor.  The sides were as bad as a school cafeteria.  But the service is even worse!  We arrived around 1:30 on a Saturday.  There were 2 large tables of people and a few other tables but still lots of empty tables (the place is pretty small).  We chose a table in the back - huge mistake, because it reeked of the smells from the bathroom.  But I wanted to try to stay positive since it was my husband's birthday.  We waited only a few minutes before a waiter came by to give us menus and get our drink order.  We ordered non-sweet tea - however, we got one sweet and one non-sweet, we were able to get that remedied, but when the waiter came back to give us the tea, he wouldn't take our order even though we said we were ready.  He said he had to get a pencil and paper and would be back. Well, he didn't come back for almost 45 minutes!  That's not to say he wasn't around, when the large table's food was ready, the brought out the plates one by one - several minutes apart.  Several other tables came in during this time, while we were still waiting to order, he actually took he new tables orders before ours!  Finally, I spoke up next time he was in our vicinity and told him we still hadn't ordered.  Even after this, it took him about 10 minutes to come back!  We should have walked out, but now it was a mission to see how long it would take.  After we ordered, we waited again.  At some point, a man came out and asked a table near us, but who had came in well after us, how long they had been waiting, and this nice lady told him that our table had been waiting longer than hers.  Turns out, they got their food before we did!  In fact several tables that came in after us got food before us.  Finally, we got our food and let me say that I have had better fried chicken from KFC - I actually think they might have gotten the chicken from KFC, because I don't remember the smell of chicken frying in the restaurant.  And of course they got our sides wrong.  At the end of our meal, a lady came by again to the table near us and apologized for the delay and asked if she could provide a dessert on the house, again the nice lady customer informed the employee that in fact we had been there much longer than them, The employee then just looked at us and reluctantly came to our table and asked us if we wanted dessert.  Having lived in the south, I am familiar with racial tensions, and I have read the other Yelpers mentioning the disparity of service for non-dark customers, this place is worse than anything I have ever experienced.  Two hours waiting for a lunchtime meal!  That's CRAZY!  I felt unwelcome and unimportant to the business.  I will never go there again.  And after all of that, it was $34.00!!  Maybe they charge by the number of minutes you occupy the table?  I think I owe my husband another birthday dinner....",

Portions were huge. My plate overflowed.  I ordered  fried chicken and boyfriend had catfish.  Both were extremely delicious.  Had a homemade quality and much better than fast food.  I will return and try other dishes.  Don't expect great service and don't expect the prettiest place to sit, expect good home cooked food.

    "text": "Three words: Incredible Fried Chicken!  Just visited this place for the first time and the food is amazing.  It's only a block from Chase Field where the Diamondbacks play and they were open until 7:00 pm on the Wednesday that I visited.  I visited in the afternoon around 3:30 and it wasn't busy.  There were three or four people at the counter and one guy in a booth.  I grabbed a booth (very comfy by the way) and was served right away.    Their menu is very basic  (main dishes, side dishes & desserts).  I ordered the Fried Chicken dinner, which comes with two sides (described below).  My beverage: a lemonade.  They don't have soda at this restaurant, which was a bummer, but the lemonade is tasty - not too tart, not too sweet.  The fried chicken is the best I\"ve had in town.  The meal comes with three juicy pieces of mouth-watering chicken and the flavor is the best I've had in valley.  This isn't fast food fried chicken.  This is fried chicken your mama would make.  Yummy!  One of my sides was green beans with potatoes.  I've never had this combination of vegetables together before and it was really tasty.  I think the green beans were from a can but I'm not sure about the potatoes.  Regardless, this was a nice side dish.  I put a little pepper on it and I was good to go.  My other side dish was rice with gravy.  I guess I'm new to soul food because I've never heard of this combination before either.  The rice they use is excellent.  I'm not sure what it was but it had a better flavor than Uncle Ben's rice.  Some kind of gravy is mixed with the rice and the two together gave me a whole new yummy experience.   I couldn't finish the whole meal and had to get a to-go box.  If I hadn't been so full I would have loved to try their dessert of the day, peach cobbler.    I would definitely recommend this restaurant to people.  It's really close to downtown Phoenix and the ball park and the food is made with a lot of love, just like Mom would make.",

Fried chicken- mmmm mmmm, big chunks, well-spiced, finger lickin good, and no skimping! 2. Sweet potatoes- sweet, sugary, good 3. Mac n cheese- pretty standard 4. Red beans and rice- this was a twist to the usual red beans and rice.  5. Corn bread- would've liked some butter or honey butter. Yum  The ambiance is killer--tagged up all over the walls!

The reason I cannot give them a five star review is because of something that happened immediately after we left the restaurant. One of the students we were dining with left their to-go container of food in the restaurant on accident. Our server brought it out to us and said, \"Do y'all want this sh**?\" That's not how you should speak to any customer, let alone a group that has children with them. My experience was dramatically soured by this. The other employees even recognized the inappropriateness of the statement because she asked him, \"Why you say it like that?\" Although I really liked the food, I don't think I can return because that sends the message that it's alright to speak to customers in this manner, and it is not.",

Do not be fooled by cheap imitations (Lolo's...oh please!); nothing compares to Mrs. White's.    Main courses:  their chicken fried steak is the best I've had and the smothered pork chops are excellent as well....extremely moist and flavorful.    Side dishes:  I am a fool for their mac and cheese.  Mac and cheese is probably my all time favorite food and Mrs. White's is the best I have ever put in my mouth.  I also love the fact that they serve rice and gravy as a side dish.  The green beans are delicious (I rarely say that about a vegetable).  The greens are fantastic.   Dessert:  Their peach cobbler is the first dessert I've eaten there and I won't try anything else because I would gladly eat my way out of a vat of their peach cobbler.  The ambiance may not be to everyone's liking.  I don't care.  When the food is this good, the rest of the world fades away and it's just you and the deliciousness.  Try it for yourself if you don't believe me.",

They literally just cut some cabbage up, cooked it and served it like that. Say far away from the cabbage..

Besides the fact that a lady came outside in the rain to tell me the other lady in wanted me because she didn't charge me right! I go back in and she says I owe her .82 cent! WTF!!!!! I even tipped them a few dollars. I ordered my food to go which took forever! What a bad first impression! I will never go back to this place or recommended it.

This food was under seasoned to say the least. Black eyed peas when prepared correctly have a gravy to them, these had water. Yams have a caramelization of goodness and brown sugar, etc that cause your yams to separate  and these were whole sweet potatoes in water. Now to the Mac and Cheese... My grandmother would be mad. The highlight was the fried chicken which was okay to say the least.  Maybe soul food in Arizona taste differently from Mississippi. If you want  authentic soul food go check out J's Chicken and Waffles in Tucson. The best yams, fried chicken, greens, etc I've tasted since living Mississippi. His chicken is the best I've tasted in my life.",

We figured that we had a couple hours before we had to be anything to do, so we might as well stop in for a lunch.  We walked into the old restaurant and the first thing I noticed were the walls; they had signatures of famous celebrities, artists, and athletes who had stopped by for food scrawled in every corner of the place. There were only two other patrons in the place at 2pm on a Wednesday, so service was snappy and quick.   We were waited on by a couple waitresses who were pleasant and recommended us different dishes. I ended up getting the country fried steak and my friends both ordered the famous fried chicken. You get a couple sides with each order, and I figured I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't give their sweet tea a try. No more than 10 minutes later, our food came out and the portions were HUGE. My friends got three gigantic pieces of chicken each, and my steak seemed bigger than my face. We have a ton of black eye peas and mac & cheese scooped onto each of our plates; even the sweet tea came in a bigger-than-normal glass!  None of us came close to finishing our plates. The food was tasty and we were definitely happy that we stopped on by. The plates are a little expensive at $13, but the ridiculous portions more than make up for that. I would definitely come back again (next time, I'll have to try the catfish and okra gumbo).",

Not a big place, so it can get busy at lunch. They're open for dinner now, too, but I have not been here for dinner. I typically get the fried pork chops, greens, and sweet potatoes. The fried chicken is really good too! All the Southern staples are available; red beans, black eyed peas, green beans, sweet potatoes, mixed greens, catfish, pork chops, and chicken. For dessert, peach cobbler. Not fancy but has never disappointed with the food. Family-owned and all very nice people.",

Mrs White's is a hole in the wall place to eat where you feel like your neighbor is feeding you.  Very, very down to earth people you would sit down and have a beer with after a long day...  This place is not known for their fast service, like Capital Grill, they are known for their damn good food.  I don't know what they cook their green beans, but it's soooo good.  It reminds me of a fresh pot of pinto beans made with ham-hocks, amazing.  I recommend getting the chicken \"smothered\" or you will be picking off your friends plate for some gravy.  My second favorite side is the Mac and Cheese, let me top it off with some Koolaid! Again, if your looking for a place with fast service try elsewhere, but if your looking for some damn good food, this is the place that is worth the wait.",

    "text": "We went about 3 pm on a Saturday, place was close to empty. Not sure if that was bc of the heat or recent negative reviews but either way it was nice for us.   FOOD: I'll start with the most important part, the food!!! For the food alone, 5 stars!! I got the catfish sandwich and cabbage, so delicious. My hubby got fried chicken, mac n cheese, and sweet potatoes. Everything tasted great and the portions where big. My picky 2 year old ate half my catfish and his dads chicken, we were amazed at that alone. As others have said, the food took a long time to come out, about 30 to 45. When it came out, it was hot and fresh. Quality food will only cook so fast so I'm not going to complain too much about the wait.  SERVICE: Staff was prompt, friendly and very polite. Everyone seemed down to earth. To some they may seem a little too laid back which may come off as unprofessional, but we didn't mind. The food is southern style soul food, it isn't suppose to be served by uptight people in a suit and tie.   ATMOSPHERE: Its a small establishment which is cool but it still could use a little work. Booths were loose and barely enough room under the table. We kept stepping on each others shoes. For people with little kids this may be important. They only had 2 high chairs, both were dirty and could have used a quick wipe down by staff before being put back. Bath room could use a little remodel and felt like a sauna. I washed my hands and ran out. It was also warm in the dinning room. In a triple digit summer quality AC is a must!!   Overall, we liked it even with some issues here and there. We will be going back.",

Pick a protein, choose two sides, and you get a piece corn bread. They cost about $13. I feel like we definitely got a lot of food. The place it self looks very old. Not well kept. Appears dirty.

It is definitely not fancy but that is ok...its not meant to be...I love smothered chicken so when I saw it that is what I ordered!  It was awesome...then I was super excited for the peach cobbler and the owner said there was only tomato cobbler...I was like WTF?? Tomato cobbler?  He was like I bet that you will like it just as much or more then the peach cobbler...I was in the mood to try something new so I said bring it out...lol...they brought it out with ice cream on it...and it was nice and warm...I was still skeptical...I had never heard of such a thing!  I took my first bite and i was in heaven it was AMAZING!!  I cleaned the bowl!  I then apologized to the owner for doubting him...I still to this day have never had a tomato cobbler but I will always remember that it was awesome! This is not the place to go if you are on a diet...but try it...its right near downtown...",

Still the same wonderful homemade, fresh food that it's always been, served in the same comfortable atmosphere. I was surprised when the server handed me a menu, but happy to see that my old standbys - pork chops, cabbage and black-eyed peas - were still there and just the same. Yes, it's slow, but good homemade food takes time, people! Nothing here is microwaved, frozen or pre-prepared. It's exactly what \"soul food\" is supposed to be... food that feeds your soul. Thank you, Mrs. White's, for keeping it real.",

    "text": "Actually found this place on Yelp! while reviewing another place. Saw all the good stuff said about the place so I gave it a shot since it is real hard to find soul-food in Arizona. Granted when I hit the parking-lot there wasn't a car out there besides a couple of vehicles parked near the back for the staff. When I walked in, the place was empty except for this kindly older gentleman who sat at the counter reading the paper, I assumed he was the owner or had something to do with restaurant because he greeted us as we walked thru the door. Turns out he was a customer like myself but must have been a regular as he played with the kid behind the counter and talked with staffed as they worked. Now remember I said it was empty but as soon as we placed our order it kinda started getting busy and when they brought our meals I seen why. I had the catfish with greens and red beans and rice as my sides. Mrs. White's hit me with 3 big pieces of catfish piping hot and crunchy on the outside flaky on the inside, and a big bowl of red beans and rice which were good with a hit of sweetness to them, never had red beans with a hint of sweet like that and then put me down with a big side of greens. My Wife had the fried chicken with mac&cheese and yams as her sides and she loved it! Needless to say neither one of us could finish had to get take home trays. Could not believe the portions for the money we paid! If you want the \"Itis\" this is the place to go.",

The food is delicious, but very unhealthy. Don't go here if you're on a diet of any kind - I'm guessing that it is all very high in sodium, fat, etc. If you're in the mood for a treat, or if you love Southern food like me, it is perfect. I had the fried chicken, which was pretty good, and my date had the smother pork chop. I wouldn't recommend the pork chop (it was pretty tough) but I would absolutely 100% recommend the smothered chicken. They gave us a piece of smothered chicken with the pork and that was delicious. The restaurant itself isn't exactly beautiful, but the food is tasty and inexpensive and the service is wonderful.",

The air conditioner was not functioning or they just didn't want to turn it on because there wasn't that many people at the time.  They did bring an electric fan out.  I had the oxtail special.  The waitress said it was cook in its own sauce.  I suspect that it was slow cook or braised with very little liquid.  It was tender but with just a right tad of chewiness left in it.  So, the texture was perfect.  You had to work it just a little bit in your mouth and that's when the flavor releases into your senses.  The ligaments near the bones were just out of this world.  Yes, you have to gnaw at the bones to get to it.  The portion is generous.  I have two sides, green beans and yams.  The yam was good but the beans tasted like canned beans.  The corn bread was gritty and nice.  I also had a lemonade which was cool and sweet.    My friends had fried chicken, catfish, smother pork chops.  We all finished our plates cleaned.",

My girlfriend ordered the chicken-fried steak, rice and mac and cheese.  Both dishes were tasty, and the only reasons I give this place 4 stars are because of the lemonade and the hired help. With all of the homemade dishes, you'd think the lemonade would be as well. Instead, it tasted like that Tampico mess that Fry's carries. As far as the staff...they were friendly to customers, but horribly unprofessional toward each other.--at least the two younger staff. Although I'm all about feeling like I'm \"at home\", I'd rather not hear people bicker back and forth in the kitchen, shouting all the foul language you'd hear at a playground. (wish I could attach soundbytes)--In all, I was impressed and neither of those two complaints could keep me from going back. :)",

Their fried chicken, smothered pork chops, collar greens, black eyed peas and rice were fantastic. The service was slow because of the place being so busy. But, their customer service made you feel like you were waiting for a meal from grandma. (the waitress kept on calling me \"darlin'\" and \"sweetness\") The decor consisted of autographs written all over the walls of famous people ranging from professional athletes to President Bill Clinton. On my last visit, I scarfed my food down so quick that the waitress felt like they didn't give me enough food. So, when I paid my tab. She gave me a to go box of dirty rice, fried chicken, collar greens and velvet cake for free. I think she did that because I told her it was my last night staying in Phoenix and that we didn't have soul food this good in the Bay Area.",

    "text": "Southern Comfort Food  I have wanted to try Mrs White's for some time, so today I put Mrs. White's on our agenda for lunch. We arrived about noon. We were greeted, seated immediately, and given the one page menu.   I  had already planned on ordering the chicken after reading all the yelp reviews however, I  was  unsure what sides to have. Mrs White's offers so many southern style sides, black-eyed peas, cabbage, collard greens, mac & cheese, rice and gravy, potato salad, and so much more.   On this visit I order the 3 piece chicken, potato salad, and rice and gravy. Our waitress reminded us that the chicken is made to order so may be a short wait.  As we waited we were treated  with cornbread and honey.  The cornbread was warm and made with real course cornmeal not processed cornmeal, it was very good.   Our chicken arrived in a short time and was served piping-hot. The chicken portion are big, three large pieces. The skin on the chicken was very crispy and had a lot of flavor. However, the chicken was just average, maybe I was expecting more and the gravy and rice lacked flavor, but the potato salad was delicious.  While dining, we noticed  that the tables were filled pretty regularly and the seats at the counter were filled the entire time. I like that the walls at Mrs White's were covered with white boards and felt pens were  available to leave messages on the boards. Parking is tight at Mrs White's but it's worth a visit.",

    "text": "March 2019 Update on Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe.   CUT TO THE CHASE - the food is good and hot - but not fast. Plan on about one hour, more or less, depending on the crowd. The menu claims \"Southern\" here and there - no comment about that, but I'll say that the food is good home cooking. Regular ($13) choices are pork chops (smothered or \"succulent\"), (deep) fried chicken, catfish, and a vegetable plate. Oxtail is an occasional special (\"Friday\" said the waiter).   Two sides are served with each entree.  In addition to those listed below, Rice (with-gravy), Beans (red), Green Beans, Sweet potatoes, Potato Salad, Mac Salad, Mac-n-Cheese, and Cole Slaw are offered.   I arrived just before noon on a Monday morning. There were about 10 other patrons when I got there (a \"half-house\"). A regular, who regaled me about Trump and his party regulars in mid-80s Manhattan, had already been served. Service was steady and none too fast - but so far as I could tell they managed  first-in, first-served sequence.   As always the fare was very good. I have a special appreciation for the \"sides\" - I ordered the recommended cabbage and black-eyed peas to go with chicken-fried steak. I also ordered \"mixed greens\" (which looked like collards) which was very good, too.   The coffee was Folgers (or equal) and strong - served with half-and-half and/or sweeteners by request.   Cornbread, not noted on the menu, is served with all meals -   The cornbread was home-made - therefore not the typical over-sugared mess that comes out of most boxes.  Desert was a generous portion of Louisiana Crumb Cake.   BOTTOM LINE - this place is all about simple, well-prepared, country-cooking - a good place to have a leisurely no-fuss meal.",

The pork chops were so tender that they could be cut with a plastic knife. The fried chicken was crispy. Make sure to go before closing. We went an hour before closing and they were out of many sides that we wanted but that wasn't their fault. We had orders of mixed greens, sweet potatoes, black eyed peas and rice and gravy. We also ordered banana pudding. It was watery but again because I went before closing, I won't subtract a star for that. Everything tasted so good. I imagine we were getting the bottom of the barrel! All and all great spot and we will be back!",

The place is a cute little restaurant w lots of personal photos, writing on the wall; very cool to see all those who have eaten and left reviews on the wall!!  For lunch we both had southern fried chicken but we chose different sides.  She had the cabbage and red beans/rice, I had the mixed greens (collard and spinach) and the green beans/potatoes.  Both were served w corn bread.  I had iced tea, she had koolaid.    The food was FANTASTIC!!!  Everything we ate was soulful, delicious, and comforting to the max!!  On top of that, service was great!  Our waiter mentioned he was there alone today and he was BUSY.  He kept our glasses full and kept us informed...he was fantastic.    This is likely the best place I've eaten in months, for sure the best of its kind in Phoenix.  A definite must!",

Myself, Dining Partner, and two others came around 12:30 on a Friday afternoon. We were maybe 1 group of 4 in the place. We got the 3 piece fried chicken with mac and cheese and collard greens as our sides. It took awhile but once it arrived, the food was good. We ended up getting a free piece of drenched chicken because the waiter couldn't remember who it went to. The drenched chicken was better than the fried chicken. They ran out of ice, so we had room temperature water and our cornbread came out after we had already finished our chicken. Maybe the waiter was new; he was definitely overwhelmed. I probably wouldn't return to eat-in but I think takeout would be the way to go.",

The green beans were a little overdone but the mac & cheese was excellent. Firm, tangy, and some of the browned edges in my bowl. Yum!

The food itself is BLAND...in case anyone hasn't noticed, the candied yams and greens are from a can - called GLORY, yes you too can have this at home, the gravy is bland and lack seasonings...if you get red beans and rice - there's your 2 sides...it's not a combo like one would expect.  Overall the chicken and anything else here fried is great, but the box mix cornbread (May be Jiffy but it taste like Glory also) and \"urban\" decor is a no-go. If you spend $50 for 2 ppl to eat (which you will here if you get a drink) you're better off going for a descent steak dinner instead.  I'm sure these folks have remained in business due to the businesses in the surrounding area and \"other\" folks that don't know what True soul food tastes like (see Amera's review lol) so they are more than happy to hand over their money and call it THE BEST THING EVER...But Mrs. White and her friends/family (whoever works the place) would be laughed out of other authentic soul food/Southern areas of the country..  This is the equivalent to Taco Bell serving Mexican Food and calling themselves Carolina's.",

    "text": "Someone PLEASE explain to me why this place gets written up as one of Phoenix's best. So disappointing!   I was really eager to try it out. My husband and I stopped in one Friday night hoping for some kick-ass Southern (he's a Southern boy, I've eaten in joints all over the South). We got a waitress who was dumber than a sofa cushion (bless her heart) who took our order verbally, then had to come back and ask what we'd ordered. I suggested that she get a pad and write it down. She still screwed it up. We waited ... and waited ... and waited ... and finally asked for some cornbread to keep the ol' blood sugar up. Took three times asking the server and the cook who also seemed to be a server. Oy. So heavy if it fell off the table it would kill the cat.  He had the chicken-fried steak, a favorite of his. He gave it a 3 out of 10. At least it was hot. He gave the sweet potatoes higher marks, but was put off by the amount of liquid butter in the bowl (and this is a man not afraid of butter).  My pork chops were lukewarm, bland and tough - they reminded me of the old Shake N Bake, except they had no seasoning that I could discern. I'd asked for the gravy on the side; it was okay, like something you'd make at home. But it took four requests for a spoon, and then I got up and went to the counter to ask for one. What really chapped my britches was the rice: plain white rice, like Uncle Ben's Converted, with not a speck of flavor. No seasoning, not even salt that I could taste. I was having school cafeteria flashbacks.  Okay, the cole slaw was respectable, but I've had just as good from a grocery store kit.  Atmosphere is supposed to be quaint and authentic - I call it grubby and beat-up, and not in a cool, hot 'n happening way.  Go to Welcome Diner if you want good, cheap Southern-inspired food, or if you don't mind a bit higher check, go to Lolo's Chicken & Waffles (which, BTW, is owned by the grandson of Mrs. White).",

I think Lolo's and Golden Rule are run by the same family (or are related somehow) and the two are quite similar. In my opinion Lolo is a full star better though, and if you are reading Yelp to decide between the two then I would recommend passing on Golden Rule.",

A really classy thing to do when she could have just said they were closed for the evening and my food was still fresh and amazing. You won a customer for life in my book :).",

    "text": "My wife loves soul food.  When I brought her to Mrs. White's, she was sold.  The atmosphere was small and felt quite authentic.  We sat and ordered fried chicken.  I had Kool -aid (red), which I have not had since I was a kid.  I forgot how delicious the red concoction was.  About 40 minutes later, our fried chicken platters came out.  My wife first said \"We could have split one\"  (\"No we could not...get your own\" I thought to myself).  The chicken was divine.  My wife magically ate all three pieces by herself.  She believes that her hands grew a mind of their own and force fed her all 3 parts, but we know better.  She raved about how delicious everything was.  I liked the chicken a lot.  The only thing that would have made the place a bit more authentic would have been some jazz or blues playing in the background.  OK, the place was fine.  Not fancy or frilly.  In fact, you can pull out a pen and leave your mark on the wall as many others have.  Try it.  Its worth the drive downtown.",

An employee came outside while we were waiting to grab a smoke.  He was friendly and started up a bit of conversation with my husband about the place.  It turns out he was one of the cooks.  When were able to finally get in, we were offered drinks, and ended up getting sweet tea, which I don't care for.  I got the smothered pork chop and two sides, the mac and cheese and the black eyed peas.    We got a corn cake to eat while we waited and when the meal came it was pipping hot and very good. Service was excellent and prices were reasonable.  I recommend this place for some True southern food.",

Well, rain or shine, I love eating Fried Chicken and nobody can take that away from me. So I saw this little bungalow-like restaurant, which is located a block away from Chase Field and also not far from my hotel, that serve authentic Southern and Soul food. But my dining experience and decision-making has costed me my hopeful solid meal.  I ordered the Fried Chicken dinner-combo for $12.00. The combo includes two sides with a slice of cornbread and I chose Rice and Mixed Collard Greens. I made a big mistake and opted to take my meal to-go to stuff my face with the fried chicken like a barbarian in my hotel room. My side of Collard Greens were very tasty and full of flavor, but a bit too watery, in which caused my side of rice to taste like a soup-like side and my monster-pieces of fried chicken's crispy skin and piece of cornbread were soggy. The fried chicken were very tasty, but it would've tasted a lot better if it wasn't for my misfortune.   This restaurant accepts only cash. I should've ate in the restaurant, because the friendly workers treated me very well and strongly convinced me to eat in. I'll definitely will eat in the restaurant  next time.  The restaurant has numerous awards from various sources including having the famous Yelp-sticker posted on the front door. The restaurant is also a favorite of the NFL's Arizona Cardinals, and NBA's Phoenix Suns with numerous pictures posted all over the facility.",

Lemonade Kool-Aid.....hmmmmm.....a little to sweet for my taste but wasn't bad  Free Refills.....very nice......ummmmmm.  Service.....good....staff very friendly.....but don't really earn there tips.  Location right across the street from Chase Field....perfectly awesome for me.  Parking Lot a bit small....but there is street parking....however be careful of that.  The building itself is very small.....like a shack almost....but not terrible.  Public Transportation nearby....that is a plus for those who live downtown.  Pricing could be better.....3 pieces of chicken....2 sides.....and Cornbread....13 bucks.  They do take debit but there is 1.00 charge I think to use it.....that is pretty terrible....but since everything was pretty good we didn't complain. We also had a groupon deal 10 bucks we paid for 20 bucks worth of food....but with the pricing of the food we barely broke even....so don't know if it is worth it. All in all in was a pleasant experience....but unless you live downtown or are attending a game driving here just for soul food....might not be your best option. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!",

Ignoring her comments......The guy begin to filibuster about how they have to cook the food. (And I guess hunt for it).  It was very bizarre and I didn't feel safe ordering anything from here,  (given the owner would  let  someone with prison inmate like customer  service skills manage the front counter....heck maybe that was the owner, that's usually how it is).   Also, no reason to go somewhere where you feel as though you're in apprehension of receiving a battery.   This was my first visit here and  I sensed the business owners play off the fact that AZ doesn't have many soul food eateries,  so they feel  they can treat customers anyway they want and they will keep coming back.   Not I.  Being from the south, im use to soul food restaurant staff having  a lil rudeness or curt like customer service skills.....but this situation was more like a scene from the tv show \"OZ\". If you don't mind being spoken to like you're on cell block d, in a restaurant that is seemingly unsanitary,  with numerous safety code violations on the outside...eat here.  #buthideyourspoons   #lowdowndirtyshame",

Well, we got our food and I had PLENTY of chicken (3 pieces) and good amount of sides. Well, my boyfriends chicken sandwich was two pieces of wheat bread with two pieces of fried chicken (leg and wing - with bones) on top of the bread. It really wasn't a chicken sandwich which was kind of disappointing. I gave him my chicken breast and took his leg. We both had ran out of water and asked for more but the server only brought us one glass so we shared that. While the chicken was very good and so were the sides I would be back but maybe not have the chicken sandwich (since it really wasn't a sandwich).",

The fried chicken was almost raw, i told the server and she got mad. We waited for a long time for the corn bread thinking it was going to be fresh, it was cold. What a shame,",

The problem was (which is no ones fault) they were unexpectedly busy and the were not prepared. But honestly that has no bearing on how great the food is here. They ran out of some popular items and couldn't keep up on the fried chicken orders. But again did not take away from our experience.  My grandma or maw maw as we called her was from Arkansas and the chicken, mac & cheese, green beans and potatoes took me back.  It did fall a little short in the fried chicken area because in two orders we did not get any breast pieces. Which for me is the money shot. I was not fan of the cornbread but that is just because it's not what I grew up on. My family makes it a little drier and less sweet. My daddy would of called that cornbread cake!  This business has been a staple in the community since 1964 with a lot of changes and development happening all around the Golden Rule. But it still remains True to it's past. Which in my opinion is wonderful to see. The waitstaff is amazing. I wish I could remember the servers names because they both did a fabulous job.",

We ordered smothered fried chicken, green beans and mac and cheese. BEST FRIED CHICKEN IN PHOENIX... idk what they put in the breading, but its amazing. The mac and cheese is the cheesiest. I honestly couldnt tell you what was better, the chicken or the sides.  The service is a little slow, we had a few different servers during the meal but they were all so friendly.  Again, come for the food, because in the end, thats all that matters!",

(That's not what turned me away b/c most y good places are hole in the walls). Food- I had high expectations.. and considering that I waited an HOUR... Let me back up.. the Customer service was appalling! Now I'm familiar with what it looks like when you're short staffed.. but this place had one girl for a busy place (so we cut her some slack on the time it took) after an hour of waiting (and we see other ppl who got there after us LEAVE) We inquire from within.. little did we know, our order wasnt even placed! The cook or sous chef I believe then comes out batter everywhere in her hands.. and apron  and semi apologized as she hollering to me from behind the counter asking what'd I order again \"mac & what\". Then she says \"look I'm sorry but she is new and I only have one fryer (with an attitude) after an hour and a half.. we got our food and it was handed to us with an attitude.. it wouldve been nice if they said \"sorry we messed up, this ones on the house\" nope!   So I finally get to the food.. and its mediocre. The cornbread had no flavor.. not sweet at all and it was cold. The mac and cheese was ok but I've had better.. the black eyed peas was under salt and the smothered chicken.. the skin was soggy from the sauce and it skin just wasnt crunchy enuf. I never write reviews this long.. but I just want to save you the time.",

I had to ask if I can take a table too, she said she didn't see me and to speak up next time.  I'm not a small person couldn't be overlooked.    Went and sat, waited forever for a nice lady who was volunteering to clear off tables.  We gave our parties full order as we were still waiting for them to arrive.  They arrived and EVERYONE got their food first and my and my cousin's irder (who PLACED the orders) were forgotten.  Waters never came, side dishes were forgotten then told when asked about then they ran out.  We were offered corn bread after everyone basically had finished and was still forgotten then the woman brought out a plate full of cornbread and two plates (we were 6 people) and asked us to pick a piece of bread off the plate, realized we all wanted some and set the full plate on an empty table and left again.   It was like she was letting us take our bread then taking the plate of leftover bread back to the kitchen or something.  After we were told they missed our two orders it still took another 20+ minutes to get it due to a change in chefs schedule and it was overlooked .  We asked for it to go.  It basically took over an hour and change to get food and it wasn't busy anymore .  The chicken was good but wound up bringing it home because everyone was finished with their whole meal and we had to leave.  I have soggy leftover chicken instead of fresh hot crispy juicy chicken.",

There is also a rear entrance if you use the parking lot or you can walk around and come in the front door. I ordered the 3 piece fried chicken meal with sides of black eye peas and rice and brown gravy for about $13. The meal came out in about 15-20 minutes. The fried chicken was very good along with the peas and rice. I really enjoyed the meal. My only complaint was that I was given 2 wings and a thigh. I can understand 1 wing but not two.give me more meat! I mentioned that to the waitress and she agreed that the kitchen made a mistake and gave me my drink for free.   I believe this is a very good soul food restaurant. The fried chicken is scrumptious and I recommend you try it. They have a dining room to eat in and the table service was friendly.",

However, deviating from my go to spot for some good old fried chicken and cornbread turned out to be a dud.  We came in for dinner on a game night and was seated rather quickly, which was good, but that was where the good ended.   A little wait was expected as this was dinner time but for some reason, the hostess/waitress didn't anticipate this? Loudly proclaiming \"damn, all y'all wanna come in at the same time?\"   Granted they may or may not have been short handed that night but hearing that out loud upon arrival was odd.  Another odd moment was when the waitress couldn't remember the order of the patrons coming in and even acknowledged it out loud. As she took orders she ended up skipping over tables that were clearly seated prior to others.  Long story short, the food took over 40 minutes to arrive, it didn't taste good, and I enjoy a good slice of cornbread from soul food joints but this place just wasn't it, the cornbread was like chewing on paper.   Again, I wanted to like this place I really did, but the golden rule after this experience is to just stay away.",

While I'm pretty sure that's not the golden rule Mrs. White is talking about, I think this one is more fitting! Her Smothered Chicken Fried Steak, dripping in gravy might as well have been dripping in gold, it tasted awesome! I ordered mine up with Mac N Cheese and Sweet Potatoes, deciding on those over the okra and the collard greens was tough, but worth it.  Unless you're on one of those reverse diet plans eating a minimum number of calories like an Olympic swimmer, you had better check you diets at the door; this ain't no place for calorie countin'. I told mine I was going out for a light jog on my lunch that day; \"You really don't need to come along.\" I told her; I hope she bought it!   The ambiance here is likened more to a waffle house experience than 5 star dining, with old school fast food type booths and seating. While you're here, read the wall closely enough, and you will find many Cool signatures penned right on to it. Famous musical entertainers, local and nationally accomplished athletes, and other famed diners can all be found to have dined here once upon a time.  Our waitress was surprisingly fit and trim for someone who serves food at a Soul Food spot. I had to ask, \"Just how do you keep that girlish figure while working and dining here?\" which she replied with \"running back and forth with orders all day\" and \"hiking my favorite trails\" on her off days. I have to note that she is now my new inspiration. Maybe I need to get a job here. I wonder how that would go over for my diet plan? Hmmmm.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, it's time to go for gold!",

We were both confused when the 'sandwich' he ordered off the menu was brought out; the fish was breaded but no sliced bread (explains why I didn't rate it 5 stars.  Really it's more like 4.5 stars).  Apparently the fish was good though!  I'd ordered the smothered pork chops with black eyed peas and coleslaw for sides.  To use Guy's terminology, both the chops & the gravy were \"On point!\".  The same could be said for the coleslaw ~ it had a great kick to it!  The peas were good, but not outstanding (can you make them outstanding?  I'm not so sure.).  Will be returning with The Boyfriend to try other options.    And have more of that coleslaw.",

First of all, there was a sign that said \"Parking $1 plus $9 Tip.\"  I don't know if it was a joke or serious but I was NOT parking there. I parked on the street. When I go inside, the place is empty. (I'm not going to go into detail about the horrible decor)  The hostess gave me a menu since I wanted it To Go, but also gave me a book of oils... Hustling OILS as I looked over the overpriced menu. Wow. Ghet-to.  The meals were $13 for an entree and 2 sides. I got the smothered chicken with gravy on the side, black eyed peas and rice, and macaroni and cheese. After waiting about 30 minutes for my $15 meal, I left. (They forgot my gravy. I went back for it)  The Meal: Chicken was incredibly fatty. Lots of parts I could not eat. The black eyed peas and rice were flavorless. No seasoning. No salt. The macaroni and cheese was clearly BOXED! Cheap, sad excuse for a soul food restaurant to have boxed soupy Mac and cheese. The meal came with cornbread which was hard and heavy and absolutely inedible. Overall, I was very disappointed with my meal and the service I received from Mrs White's. I'm not fond of LoLos either but I would GLADLY eat there before spending another dime at Mrs White's. The search for good soul food in Phoenix continues...",

    "text": "We called in an order from Scottsdale and when we arrived we were not pleased. Not only was our order not ready, they were out of the item we ordered - chicken fried steak. When we chose the second option, the fried fish, we were told they were out of that option too. The owner was at the store shopping. Jamal told us that we could get a steak burger so we agreed. After offering free drinks while we waited, we paid and left. When we checked our order in the car, the order that was ready was incorrect. We ordered the three piece chicken dinner with an extra piece on the side. We went back into the store only to be told that we weren't charged for the chicken and that we'd have to wait... Again. Jamal came out of the kitchen and asked if we wanted a big wing... That's not what we asked for. After waiting an additional 15 minutes to cook one piece of chicken, Jamal tells the waiter, from the kitchen, that we didn't pay the $2.50 for the piece of chicken.... Like are you serious??? Jamal then told us that he had to cook in the kitchen because the cook had to pick up her kid from school... Like we didn't have plans....  Not only did they get out order wrong, we had to wait TWICE and they had the NERVE to ask for an additional $2.50?!?!   I really like Mrs. White's but this is THE worst service I've experienced.  Lessons learned:  1. Don't order ahead. 2. Check your order. 3. If you place a to go order, make sure you know what they are serving THAT day.",

    "text": "There's something about Mrs. White's that no other place has.  It's not something you can bottle up and sell.  It's the love they put into every meal.  I have to tell you... when a friend suggested we go to Mrs. White's yesterday when our plans were changed, I was ecstatic.  I had not been in quite awhile.  I could already imagine myself eating those green beans and potatoes, sweet potatoes and fried chicken.    Once we got there, that is exactly what I ordered!    I could tell, too, that my chicken was made with an extra side of love.  It was phenomenal.    The people that don't like Mrs. White's don't get it.  I heard a lady complaining yesterday about how long her food was taking.  It kind of made me smirk.  Food this good is cooked to order... and takes time.  I knew it would be a long wait for our food, but I wasn't on a lunch hour.  I feel like anyone who is on a lunch hour might be better served hitting Mrs. White's another time.    The people there are all great.  If you take the time to talk to the people who work there, you will see how nice they are.  We got to talk to \"Wink\" about how he got his nickname from his grandma in St. Louis.  I told him about how I got my nick name, too.    I love Mrs. White's and I hope to visit again soon.",

    "text": "My family and I ate there today. The chicken was okay. What I did like about the chicken....it was not greasy. What I didn't like, no flavor. We weren't told until after we ordered that they were out of macaroni and cheese and coleslaw . They brought us cornbread with no honey. The service was less than average. They took our order for drinks but did not bring them in a timely fashion. We then placed our order. While waiting we asked for refills . We had no napkins or forks at our table. We had asked the person who refilled our drinks but he never came for them. As we ate the cornbread we had to wipe our hands on our pants due to ,no napkins. Our food finally came but as the people who brought our food were leaving we asked for napkins and forks. My daughter in law ordered pork chops but the plate came with no knife. The server did come immediately to bring forks and napkins but we said we needed a knife. No knife came. We're eating and enjoying our food and a server came to the area for another table as she was leaving we asked for a knife. No knife was coming because this server started waiting on another table. my husband then gave his knife he had been eating his chicken fried steak with so she could eat her pork chop. Then he finally went to the front to get a knife. Just because you are a Phoenix staple from back in the 60's does not mean service should lack. It seems unorganized. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because my daughter in law and husband said the pork chop was tasty, the green beans and potatoes were good, so was the catfish. I know inside is dated but it was like you were stepping back in time. My suggestion would be for the staff to take a trip to Amy Ruth's in Harlem. Eat there for breakfast , lunch and dinner and take note of the food, the cleanliness, customer service, and organization of the staff.",

Service can be a little slow at times, but it's worth the wait, so if you don't have any patience in waiting for your made to order amazing food, then you may want to go when you have time. It's a very small place so you may want to take that into consideration if you are going with a large party. Only complaint, is that one waitress messed up on my drink order and forgot to bring us our corn bread (which is amazing btw). I didn't bother to mention my drink order mix up because it was getting pretty packed and she seemed overwhelmed, so I drank my lemonade that was supposed to be tea. Which was good too, so I didn't mind. I give the food an A+++, Waitservice (on this day) C-.  I'll always go back when I'm craving homecooked southern/soul food.",

Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe isn't \"golden rule\" at all because if this group of people came to my place, I'd feed them better and treat them friendlier then they ever did me.   After the New Times Best of 2011 came out, this place won(!) and  I made note to visit the place soon and  the best it got all night were two female dishwashers, in the parking lot, smoking, who could not have been nicer with their welcome.  But that, my friend, is as good as it got.  The waitress, and calling her a waitress demeans all perfectly good servers across the valley, she would not get up from her seat at the counter to serve me!  She merely slid the menu across the counter to me and said, in a very unfriendly voice, whaddya havin'?  The owner sat behind the counter counting his money -- SERIOUSLY -- and bragged to no one listening how he'd seen the same Casino-B Act three times in a day the day before.  Wow.  The chicken came, it was good.  I paid $21 for a plate of fried chicken, all white meat, black-eyed peas and another memorable side I cannot recall.  They were out of mashed potatos.  HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF MASHED POTATOES?  OH, WAIT, WATCHING A B-LIST CASINO ACT 3 TIMES IN A DAY MIGHT TAKE AWAY FROM KITCHEN PREP DUTIES, NO?!!!!!  I told my friend on the way home what a scam that was.  I said one original recipe whole breast from KFC would be as good or better.  We stopped at the next KFC...and I was right!  $2.47 for one whole breast from KFC vs. $21 --- PER PERSON! -- at Mrs. White's.  STAY WAY AWAY FROM MRS. WHITES!  This guy, this family should get down on their hands and knees, every night and thank God for Jerry Colangelo, the Diamondbacks and the gentrification of their neighborhood.  It allows, at least, a couple of casino shows per night!  The sycophants who've written before me must want to misinform you:  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  I WASTED MY MONEY FOR YOU!  update 1/20/13-a private message from Tony accuses me of racism.  Really?  What did I say here that was racist?  That I didn't like the food?  That's not racist.  That's the food. That the owner was counting his money?  Again, not racism.  The only thing racist here is Tony.  The food here is VASTLY OVERRATED!  I'M TELLING YOU, EL POLLO LOCO has better chicken than this DUMP, by FAR!  And you don't have watch an extremely fat waitress refuse to get up...oh, wait.  She can't.  She's too fat.  9/8/2018-dirty kitchen. See Photo Maricopa County Health Department:  GRADE: D. D!!'",

For more than 50 years this place has served up smothered pork chops, oxtail, fried chicken, cabbage, perfectly seasoned green beans, fried okra that isn't too hard to eat and the most moist cornbread I ever ate.

The board behind the long counter has the available plate dinners and sides. Get the smothered pork chops. Near perfect thin little pork pieces of heaven! The cabbage is melt in your mouth leaves of joy. I honestly felt like I had been to Sunday dinner after church with ladies who wear big hats...ya know?

It's just a hole in the wall slice of delicious everything you could want in a mom and pop place that's been an institution in Phoenix for 5 decades.  Did I say go here and eat already? Then why aren't you there?",

It's not a very big place, but people will stop in for lunch if they are working in the city. Lunch for a quick bite while out and about in the city will also work here.  I had the fried chicken, which is the signature dish here, along with cabbage and red beans. The chicken was crispy, tasty, and had plenty of meat for flavor. I think they even add the kicky flavor to it, which I admire. The cabbage is an automatic 5 Stars. It was delicious, cooked well, and probably some of the best cabbage I've had in a while. And the red beans and rice had a bit of a creamy flavor to them, but good nonetheless. Great lunch plate!  The cornbread could've been a bit better since it was a little hard, but it had good flavor. I also had a bite of the green beans, which were more flavorful than some others I've had in the past. The sides list is pretty expansive, so poke around for what you want.  They also have check marks on the food meaning they are fresh out. Usually around lunch time is when they get busy so get here early so you won't miss out. Getting here can be a bit difficult, since the rail is in the middle of the street, but there is plenty of parking in the back. Come on down for some good soul food for lunch!",

For down home cooking I recommend coming here, soulfood in the valley has been hard to fine. But after trying this place trust me it's good. Small and relaxing, they keep it simple with good results.    I'm very impressed with my Catfish dinner w/Sweet Potatoes  & Red Beans w/rice, cornbread was hot out the oven, and Red Koolaid.  This is what soulfood suppose to be. Not complex but simple and good.  You're able to write your name and comments on the wall, has a lot of history here.  If you're in the area please make sure to stop by and try them. You won't be disappointed!!!!",

But their fried chicken was delicious and they have a lot of sides. They were out of cabbage and okra, so I had to go for green beans and rice.... Ok so basically what I'm saying is come early cause once they run out, they run out....  Came here around 2PM and it was exceptionally ... filthy. Dirty. I feel bad saying so. Sat down to grab a seat and it took a while before they cleaned off our table, we even \"bussed\" our table to help make things go quicker. Kool-aid was crazy sweet. They forgot to give us cornbread so they gave it to us to-go since I asked for it at the register. They didn't have a pen for me to sign my receipt so they said don't worry about it but when I said I wanted to tip they went looking for one, and a pen should be available at the register, esp when you're about to pay for your food! It was just so disorganized.   As for the food, the fried chicken was good, but nothing of my sides were hot. Lukewarm at most. Red beans were not good at all. Rice was decent because it had no flavor. I wish I could have opted for other sides.   SAVING GRACE: HOT SAUCE. Laddle it on.",

We came in on a Sunday right as they opened and were greeted by the friendly staff.  She gave us menus and also helped us with recommendations.  There was a group of 8 of us, and we wanted to try everything!  The chicken was lightly coated with a great seasoning, cooked perfectly.  From what I understand, she has a small fryer in the kitchen so it's cooked in small patches.  This means your getting it fresh and hot.  It hasn't been sitting around for hours.  The sides were delicious as well.  Honestly, some of the best greens I've ever had!  Corn bread, mac and cheese, green beans and black eyed peas...oh my!  Everything was sooo tasty and its all served up with sweet tea.  For desert we had sweet potato pie and I telling you, I thought I had gone to heaven.  We hit this place up on the way to the airport. If you're ever in Phoenix area or even passing through, check this place out!",

I love how like half the complaints aren't about the food, it's that the inside is kinda trashy. Well, come on, did you see the outside?  The treasure lies behind the line, and there's a lot of choices but they have legendary catfish, and I mean legendary generally not legendary for Arizona. (Arizona is not known for catfish. Sorry, folks, gotta break it to ya...)  The greens are solid. I wish I knew how they made them so smoky without meat, and the only hint I got was \"you gotta use butter.\"  Welllllllllllllll I will figure this out.   But the catfish, oh the catfish, a little sweet and mild, the kind of flavor you only get from well-raised catfish. Perfectly seasoned, not oily in the slightest. The fried chicken is as good, too...but fried chicken is easy. Catfish is not. Catfish must be handled with love and care.   Theirs is.  Other highlights: solid potato salad and creamy sweet cole slaw. Sweet potatoes are heavenly.   I know they have red drink but I'm all about that iced tea. Half sweet half not. Nothing goes down your gullet faster on a hot day in Phoenix.   Can be a little slow if it's bumping. Doesn't matter, worth every second of wait and every penny you pay.  Don't miss this place.

    "text": "Mrs. White's is an iconic downtown staple.  During our early years of marriage, I worked across the street as a clerk.  I would  often dine here on Friday's as a treat when I got paid.  I distinctly remember smelling all that chicken cooking on that greasy cauldron somewhere in the back. It was always calling out my name. The chicken, along  with the generous portion of corn bread, enlivened my otherwise boring, office. clerical experience.   Fast forward to one particular Sunday when we happened to be driving around downtown phoenix. We wanted to relive our \"golden years\" and decided to revisit Mrs White's.  What's not to like about this place? It's unshakable.  It's stalwart even.   You might even say it's predictable.  They serve great fried chicken. They also serve hearty pork chops, when they have them.  For sides they have great sweet beans and corn bread.  Their lemonade is to die for.  However, much of what we remembered and were expecting didn't quite come to pass. On our visit they were all out of chops and there weren't enough beans. The chicken / corn bread portions were measly in comparison to what we so distinctly remember. To add to the disappointment,  their prices were much higher. If I were to look back at what it cost to eat here now versus back then, I could not have afforded to have lunch here with my measly paychecks.  In any case, the portions that we did receive were quite spicy and oh so delectable. While they were all out of desserts when we first walked in, they must have seen our crestfallen expressions, because somehow chocolate cake magically appeared. Nonetheless, we left  disappointed because of the meager quantity that they now serve, even if it is the same great quality we remember.   Maybe times are tough. I'm not sure. But I'm still quite certain that they still have one of the best fried chickens in town.",

We listened as staff argued over who was going to make the sweet tea, a phone call about a staff coming in hungover. We ate, food was good, not bad but this trip today has damaged my thought of this place. I brought my brother here for the first time and the customer service was the worst and that's all he talked about as we left.

Let's talk sides:  The Mac is delicious. It has a bit of a kick to it, making is way better than the boring Mac at other establishments. The cabbage was awesome and green beans were also good. I like a good amount of salt and didn't have to add a pinch! The coleslaw is some of the best I've had. Finally, the cornbread. OMG it doesn't even fall apart and was buttered perfectly.  To end the meal I had the peach cobbler. It came out pipping hot and was an awesome mix of fruit, cinnamon and crust. I wish I had taken it to-go because I was so full I couldn't finish and would have loved to have a scoop of ice cream on top.  DO NOT drive passed this old, yellow building.

I literally waited about 40 min until I got my food and after watching people who ordered after me get their food I was getting hangrier. Got back to my hotel room, still a little grumpy, but when I finally dug into my dinner, I was very pleased. The chicken was well cooked and flavorful. The sides were scrumptious. The cornbread was ok. I definitely want to try some of their other dishes.",

I was shocked ut came so quick.  I see the price has went from $10.00 to $13.00. I notice the portions have decreased.  The greens lack season per a black operated establishments.  Season the CALLARD GREENS my people. keep enough corn bread cook. I heard the cooks were out.   One is having a child. The other cook is out of town.

The gravy went so well with everything that I ended up smothering everything. Came with freshly baked cornbread.   Excellent meal.. Try the smothered pork chops.. or the Ox Tails. Lots of side dishes  It's simple to order, look at the mural on the wall. No checks, just tell the cashier what you had on the way out.   Smothered chicken (two large pieces) cost $14. Entrees come with two sides and corn bread. Fast service. Mrs. White (in her 90s) still bakes pies for the restaurant... try the peach.  Her son, Lolo, has branched out and has three upscale restaurants scattered around the Valley: Lolo's Chicken and Waffles.",

However, it was full of people from as diverse of cultures as possible for somewhere this small. Also, nobody is any hurry here which feels like a southeastern thing.   So why five stars then?  Well, I found this place on Yelp and was aware of all of the above. People still raved about the food!  I ordered the fried chicken meal with mixed greens and red beans and rice. Wow!  I had no idea fried chicken could taste like this. Super crispy and flavorful breading and very moist chicken. The highlight of the meal may have been the mixed greens. They were fantastic. Got a peach cobbler for the wife on the way out. Did it all for $20 including tip. Won't miss this place when back in Phoenix!    Matty approved!",

Nothing else at all. But this is some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. The chicken fried steak was also delicious! Can't say much for the sides.  It's a hole in the wall with graffiti everywhere. I think they've kind of made that they're thing, just letting people write on the walls. It was probably meant to be artistic but it just looks trashy.  Come for the food, and the people are pretty friendly too :-)",

We both got sweet tea (which wasn't sweet enough in our opinion, but we've been spoiled by South Carolina sweet tea) but it was still good.   I got the Fried Chicken plate with sweet potatoes and mac n cheese, he got the pork chop plate with green beans and coleslaw. When it came out, the chicken was still crackling from being taken out of the fryer. I had to wait for it to cool down, so I dug in to the sides. The sweet potatoes were delicious and the mac n cheese was so good. I tried a bite of the pork chops and almost thought I had made a mistake in ordering the chicken since they were that amazing. The coleslaw was also excellent in it's vinegar-y goodness.  But then I tried the fried chicken...and went to heaven. I couldn't stop eating it. Finger-lickin' good. They gave me a huge serving so I took the leftovers home and had them for dinner tonight. Normally leftovers don't heat up well, but these were an exception. All that remains of my dinner yesterday are the chicken bones and cravings for more. I will be back soon!",

My wife and I felt welcomed even though you could tell the restaurant was filled with regulars. Straight forward menu, everything is the same price except the daily special, did I say unpretentious?  Not fast but friendly and GREAT food, no ambiance but friendly and GREAT food. We haven't tried everything on the menu yet, however: Fried Chicken 10 Chicken Fried Steak 10 (gravy was wonderful) Catfish 10 Mixed greens 10 Rice & gravy 8 (sometimes not as hot as it should be) Green beans & Taters 10 Black eyed peas 8 Corn bread 10 Mac & Cheese 3 (sorry).  Great food from fine folks since 1964!",

I have had just about everything on the menu, at least once, and find that it is still worth the drive, no matter how far out of the way I am to indulge in some of that delicious home cooking. Peach cobbler is an amazing aperitif when there's room or if any is left. However, it does not travel by plane well as we very messily found out one afternoon.",

Just to let all of you know you can order healthy from the menu, which is written on the wall but really what would be the point of excusing you from the best fried chicken in Phoenix?   The drink menu is not vast, 3 different drinks and that is it. I suppose the charm of the place is that, well, it is what it is, its a good eats in downtown phoenix that does not try to be anything else. Its not heart healthy but who wants to live forever and its not as it your going to make this a staple in your day to day eating.",

They only could justify that untruth if they did not grow to in a family that cooked with love or never been to  a Kentucky Fried Chicken.  The food and service was horrible.  My guest and I had to ask for silverware, cornbread and refilled....again \"what the hell\".   I was raised on soul food and know the difference between store bought and homemade.  Oh sure they doctor it up but totally got the prescription wrong.  The food has absolutely no flavor, lacks salt, lowreys seasoning, black pepper, garlic powder, mind you these are staples in cooking soul food especially Fried Chicken.  I'm African American so this next statement is not intended to be racist but come on black people, how can you tout yourself as the best Fried Chicken and truly taste horrible.  Again, \"what the hell\".   It's very easy to make gravy....especially if you have the drippings from your fried chicken so why did this gravy taste like it came from a can.  What surprised me most was to see the tourist eat their food like it was the best food they ever tasted.  Poor visitors, this is not soul food.  Save your 17.00 per plate and drink  and go have Kentucky or better yet Jack in the box.  Yes almost $34 for two plates of chicken and two drinks.  Honestly people \"what the hell\"?",

    "text": "We have been going to Mrs Whites for years now. We would go there as a treat every so often because there food was fantastic. Unfortunately it has really gotten pretty bad in the last year or so. Its really sad to, we loved Mrs Whites but not anymore.      The last couple times we went the food was pretty sub par. The portions were much smaller and the quality and taste was rather poor. A couple of times ago we went with myself, my mother and my brother. I dont want this to sound racist but I feel it needs to said. I felt like we were definitely the wrong color to be eating there.     The service was ok but i noticed it was much better for the \"locals\" who were there at the same time. We ordered and sat and waited for our meal. I watched as some of the people around me were brought the same thing I had ordered and it looked fantastic. Nice big pieces of chicken with large portions of sides.      Well finally our food came and what a disappointment. Our portions were MUCH smaller then everyone elses and the sides were about half the size. My mother ordered catfish, (her favorite thing there) and it looked like it was half a filet. My smothered chicken was 2 very small wings and one small breast, (I had ordered all white meat) and there was very little gravy and cabbage.       I went ahead and tried Mrs Whites one last time a couple weeks ago and it was more of the same thing. I ordered the smothered chicken again and when it arrived I received 2 small wings and a back bone with no meat. The table right behind me had the same thing and received 2 large breasts and a nice sized wing. After attempting to eat the skin off the back bone I gave up and ate what little else there was on the plate. My mother did get a nice sized catfish filet but both our sides were very small.      I no longer recommend Mrs Whites. It looks like the kids have taken over running the place and I think thats the problem. The gentleman who was always in the kitchen did a wonderful job of making the place a great choice for fantastic food but i dont see him there much anymore.     Stay away from Mrs Whites unless you happen to be the right color. Very sad.",

Instead they stayed back behind the counter and told us to sit anywhere without any kind of courtesy or etiquette. Our waitress definitely did not want to be there and had an attitude. We picked a table and sat down. They were slow to give us our menus. We got our food quick enough and it was tasty but definitely not better than Lolo's. The waitress never came back to ask if we need anything else or to fill our water or lemonade glasses. We had to shout across the dining room to get her attention for more lemonade. The absolute worst was when we went up to pay, they never handed us a bill and overcharged us. The old man at the register didn't even know what we ordered and when we told him, just spat out a number \"$33.16!\" without doing any kind of math. He was very rude to my boyfriend who tried to pay with a credit card. Instead of just asking my boyfriend if he had cash, he barked, \"Didn't you see the sign?! We take cash!\" We didn't make a scene but it really pissed us off. Their signage is confusing. There was a broken machine sign on the wall but the menu said \"we are now accept credit and debit cards.\"   Also, the place is filthy. Dirty floors, walls, and windows. The bathroom smells like hot ass. For some reason, the bathrooms don't have AC but the rest of the restaurant does. Absolute worst! We've had great food and service at Lolo's! They definitely know how to make you feel welcomed. I love the servers at Lolo's; they are attentive, friendly, and helpful. I can't believe the two families are related. WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!",

    "text": "Food coma?  Ohhh  yes!  My sister and I went here for lunch today.  I thought she would be afraid of the Sharpie menu on the wall and low key tables/booths, but she was up for an adventure in delicious southern cooking.  The walls are covered by autographs of athletes, musicians, and others. The menu consists of Fried Chicken, Chicken Fried Steak, Catfish, Pork Chops, Meatloaf, Neck Bones, and Ox tails.  Sides include black eyed peas, cabbage, green beans and potatoes, yams (they were out by 12:30 today!), collard greens and rice smothered in gravy.  You usually have to ask for cornbread.  The sweet tea is just like mom used to make when we were kids.  You basically get a meat and two sides.  We have never had room for dessert, so I have no idea what is offered. My sister had the Chicken Fried Steak which was humongous and the perfect saltiness.  She had rice and cabbage.  The cabbage was spiced up with hot pepper.  I had the catfish which was a generous portion perfectly breaded and fried.  The green beans and potatoes were peppery and yummy.  The cornbread is spread with butter and very dense and delicious.    They only accept cash, so come prepared about $13 bucks a person.  They won't give you a check, so when you are done, just walk up to the counter and pay.  There is a small parking lot in the back of the restaurant.  They have always been friendly to us when we visit, and we will always go back for delicious southern food!",

We originally ordered catfish and they came back about 4 minutes later and told us they didn't have catfish. A customer walked in about 20 minutes after that and when the waitress said they didn't have catfish the big man that runs the place spoke up and said \"yes yes we do have catfish\". I think he only told that customer they have catfish because he is biased. I am white and they didn't want to serve white people the good stuff it was only for their special guests or other black people. The waitress didn't smile once; when i asked if they had coca cola or dr. pepper she said \"NO!\" in a very hateful tone and looked at me like i was scum. I felt like I wasn't welcome there the whole time I was there. Gave me the suspicious eye. Let's get rid of the prejudice people. We. Can. All. Get. Along. Anyways if your black, they will call you brother or sister and give you the royal treatment but whites should stay away unless you want shitty ass service.",

I also ordered collard greens and green beans. The collard greens were excellent, but the green beans were pale and mushy, as if they'd come from a can. The restaurant wasn't crowded, so I was able to observe a customer at the counter successfully negotiating with the restaurant staff for free carry-out food for her family function. Meanwhile, that same staff forgot that I had already paid for my food, and tried to charge me twice. I had paid in cash and had been given no receipt or bill, so I couldn't begin to prove my honesty in the matter. A little uncomfortable, needless to say.",

My wife got the same but had the mac and cheese.   You must also order the Kool-Aid... HUGE glass... and many childhood memories.   You get three ***HUGE** pieces of PERFECTLY seasoned (and cooked) fried chicken... and the two sides... unbelievable! The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!   We could not even finish half of our meal... and we took home an order of Mrs. White famous Peach Cobbler, which we enjoyed with coffee after we got home. TO DIE FOR!  In summary... GREAT MEAL!

We never got any cornbread. I got maccaroni rather than the requested rice and gravy. The photos on the menu implied a pair of bone in chops rather than the boneless pieces of dry pork loin in a flavorless crust I was served, one at a time. The fried chicken was inconsistent in that some parts were rare and others overcooked! Finally we were charged an additional 70 cents for the luxury of using a credit card. So the meal was $13 a plate plus two and change each for weak sweet tea and lemonade. The biggest waste of $38 in recent memory. The servers were surly and disinterested. Mrs. White would be embarrassed at what has transpired since her departure.  I long for the days in the 70's when Lucille's Soul Food Cafe was on Washington with her 'real deal' oxtails and genuinely delicious food. This place is the WORST!",

Now I will say to bring a bushel of patience with you as everything moves kind of slow here but that's okay with me, I came knowing that so no issue. The menu items are all $13 and you get your main dish and 2 sides. I went with the fried chicken with mac and cheese and mixed greens. Wifey had the Chicken Fried Steak, okra gumbo (awesome!) and mac and cheese. They also brought out fresh corn bread. Not my thing, but wifey really liked it. I also was able to get a big ole glass of Kool Aid with my meal, score!  The chicken was super fresh, juicy and perfectly seasoned. The greens and mac and cheese were also done to perfection.

I just want to say that it takes a lot for me to complain or for that matter to write a negative review...I would rather not say anything at all.  You know...that whole \"if you have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all\" rule!  That being said...we were so disappointed.  Customer service was hit and miss...the waiter was nice enough...the waitress was...ummm... lets say rough around the edges.  As for the food....seriously bland.  Not gross....but not good by any means.  Mediocre at best.  Some cornbread showed up out of the blue when we were almost done with our meals.  The waitress seemed  offended that we didnt eat much of it.  Oh well...we will be marking this one off the list.  : /",

Although it took a bit to figure out what menu item/items were best for the occasion, everyone I spoke to was just AMAZING. It goes without saying that the chicken was delicious but the reason I give this place five stars is more about the people. Service with a smile, for sure! Thank you, Mrs. Whites!",

However, once we were in, seated and placed our order, I was thoroughly comfortable and enjoying the vibe. It was lunch time, it was crowded and it reminded me of a family reunion. Everyone was enjoying their meals and each other. The staff was busy as bees and enjoying themselves as well.   I had the fried chicken, green beans and corn bread---all perfectly cooked and seasoned---just like Granny used to make. Huge serving sizes, had to take most of it back to my hotel because I also wanted to try their peach cobbler.....yummy for the tummy!   It has been about 10 years since my 1st introduction to Mrs. White's and  I have visited many times throughout the years and have had most everything on the menu, never been disappointed.   Best soul food in AZ       I love, love, love Mrs. White's",

I have been coming here for 30 years and they have the best chicken fried steak I have had in my life.\"  \"Hey, I know better than to doubt you, grandpa.\" replied the young man with the same face, minus 40 years and 30 lbs but with the benefit of an extra 4 inches in height.  The old man ordered a lemonade to wash it down and the kid took a sweet tea, both ariving in giant plastic cups that reminded the kid, now nearly 30 of his childhood summers spent with his family in El Paso,Texas with his father's family who had moved with the army from Mississippi many years before he was born but brought the traditions of cooking for taste and comfort and damned be anyone for telling them it wasn't healthy.  They sat quietly, tired from a morning of moving furniture into the young man's new home, reading the signatures on the wall. The old man pointed out and explained who some of the old-timers were, mostly polititians and actors who, while big in their day, were not legendary enough to cary into the vernacular of pop culture 30 years later, and the young man pointing out and explaining the athletes and musicians of his era.  The waiter dropped off their chicken fried steaks along with their sides: Red beans, rice with gravy, greens and potatoes. They grinned in acknowledement of having made the right choices and began to eat.  \"You know, her son opened a chicken and waffle place not too far from here.\" ther kid said, \"but you are right; this place is better. Thanks for your help today grandpa.\"",

The chicken platter comes with three pieces of chicken and two sides.  I would recommend either platter.  I get the Tiger Woods to drink.

We visited this somewhat historic spot after a play at the nearby Black Theater Troupe's Black Nativity production, which was great by the way.   Okay, the confines are rustic in the sense that it has absolutely no frills about it.  You get the feeling that not much has changed whenever it opened, whether it was in the 60s, 70s or 80s.  Where its progeny, Lolo's (grandson of Mrs. White) has developed a Phoenix soul food favorite replete with friendly confines in phoenix as well as Scottsdale Mrs. White has kept it very simple for only those very comfortable with a non dressed up locale.   Finally, the food.  I was skeptical initially.  The decor made me assess and reassess whether I wanted to give it a shot.  The menu, very limited.  They do a couple of things and they do them very well.  Fried chicken, smothered fried chicken, pork chops, catfish, corn bread.  We had a fried chicken dinner, a smothered chicken dinner and two veggie dinners.    All were excellent.  The veggies were cooked in a clear southern tradition to the greens and black eyed peas.    If I'm down town and have a yearning for fried chicken or great collard greens (better than Lolo's by far) this is the place to trek to.  Take it from a native North Carolinean.  Worth the visit.",

From start to finish it took almost 3 hours. Three of us ordered drinks, waited 15 minutes. Not too bad I guess, But then the food service happened.   3 Orders. Every single one was messed up. From wrong sides to whole wrong orders.  One order was completely wrong to the point my head almost exploded and worst of all, nobody cared. We received two side for one order before the protein, Then my order came, which had a wrong side 20+ minutes after the other's sides. Then a 3rd plate came that was wrong entirely. Which they took back and fixed after another 20+ minute wait. So once they've fixed my sides and another person's whole meal the waiter goes \" Okay, we're all good here?\" .......At this point we are still missing the Main protein from the very first dish, who at this point has eaten her sides because it's been just under an hour later.   The cook came out and gave the most half-assed apology I've ever heard and moved along with her day, She couldn't have cared less. I was told this place was great but our experience was terrible. The chicken was decent at best and the side were underwhelming. I wanted to like this place so much, But Alas I cannot.",

We ordered sweet tea and waited about 10 mins until another server came by and asked for our drink orders again. We both said we ordered the sweet tea and she responds \"sure, I'll bring it out\" to my surprise I get handed a regular unsweetened tea with SWEETENER PACKETS!!! What kind of sweat tea is this?! But I decide to not say anything and just wait for our food. So our food comes and we never receive the corn bread which is supposed to come with the meal so I'm just not very impressed at this point. Then ANOTHER server asks to refill our drinks and we say we had ordered sweet tea, SHE COMES BACK WITH SWEET TEA!!! Like where was this tea when I first ordered it and why didn't I get it???? Very disappointed in this place to say the least and I have to say that I make better greens than theirs tasted",

The \"world famous fried chicken\" (which took 20 minutes to bring) tasted like Banquet frozen chicken. The server brought our cornbread 10 minutes after our lousy chicken. We had no silverware for a while.  My other colleague ordered the special ribs. He compared them to the McRib sandwich which I thought was an insult to Mickey D's. The men's bathroom didn't have hand towels to add to our misery. The coup de gras was we paid $16 for a crappy chicken plate and an iced tea.

    "text": "Looks like I'm still in search for the best chicken in town. Since I have moved here, I have been searching for food that can replace my favorites from Long Beach area.  I came here after reading all the great reviews, and hearing about it in the news and tv shows. All I can say is their chicken is good. Nothing I haven't had before. Very crispy, skin had a lot of flavoring. The chicken did not. I also had rice and gravy, potato salad, corn bread, and lemonade. Their potato salad was great, reminded me of our family bbq in the LBC. Rice and gravy was ok, not much flavor. Especially when you are eating chicken the gravy becomes a beverage. Corn bread was really good also.  The pros: Lemonade Service Potato salad Cornbread  Cons: Prices Size of the chicken Rice  Again, this is not a bad place. Probably come back again. However, I am still looking for that great fried chicken!",

    "text": "really want to like this place...and honestly the food is okay, I would give it a 4.5.  I was really excited to find another soul food resturaunt because they are so hard to find in Arizona and it's down the street from work so that even sweetened the pot. I'm basically going to list the pros and cons of this place.  Pros:  -Free/ convenient parking -Quality food 4/5 ( 4 because my fried pork chop was SUPER salty and my neck bones were not seasoned enough) - Very friendly staff - small mom and pop restaurant ( not a chain, so the location still has that homey feeling)  Cons: -SERVICE ( there is something DEFINITELY left to be desired)- I've been here twice and both times my order was made incorrectly... 1) a coworker and I placed an order.. we pick it up to find they placed my fried pork chop with her sides and her smothered pork chop with my sides. Instead of offering to fix it, they told us to just swap everything around ourselves. So messy! 2) I ordered neck bones with cabbage and yams as a side and a separate side of yams for someone else. I pick it up and there are 2 sides of yams in my container...keep in mind one was for someone else. Before fixing it the argued back and fourth a bit and asked me if I clarified over the phone that it was for someone else....I DID, I even asked her if she understood to put it in separate containers and she said yes. Obviously not.   -somewhat over priced.  All in all I really want to support this place... a homeless man around 19, walked in and said he was down on his luck and wanted to know if they could help him out. The owner (I'm guessing) told him to have a seat, she asked what he wanted to drink, went to the kitchen and returned with a full plate of food for him. It's not often that people express this amount of kindness for someone that can't do anything for them in return.   So I would give the food a solid 4 and the service a 3...making that a 3.5...but since 1/2's don't exist on yelp I will give it a 4. With better service this place could be amazing!",

Mrs. White's Golden rule has the best fried chicken in town. I was doing some work downtown and my wife and I wanted lunch. As we were driving back, I checked yelp to see what restaurants are nearby. Mrs. White's came up as a choice. The exterior of Mrs. White's hides the classic soul food inside. There is parking in the back which made it easy this to relax and not worry about where you parked your car. I had the three piece fried chicken with mac & cheese and as recommended to me, the Cabbage. My wife had the chicken fried steak with cabbage. She is not a big eater and the first thing she said to me that she would not be able to finish her meal. She finished almost all of it and said it was the best she's ever had. But back to the chicken. The coating was absolutely perfect and the chicken was moisture inside. We also ordered two sweet teas and for dessert we shared a peach cobbler. So, I'm not much for desserts. However, the peach cobbler was good. One of the things that impressed me the most was the way you pay for your meal. When I asked for the check the server said no just go up to the register and tell them how many meals you had, how many drinks you had and if you had dessert. Everybody was nice, it was a great experience though the place is small, Don't let it scare you off. We had lunch at around 11 o'clock and there was only two other families there. We are going to go again and again and again.",

We weren't greeted warmly as someone had said in the previous reviews instead coldly, we then proceeded to seat ourselves because no one greeted us.   ...15 minutes later after sitting down, a server finally came over and took our drink orders. Then another 30 minutes to get our drinks. Service was very very slow. We sat patiently then the server came around and I asked her were were ready to order. She replied rudely \"I'm the only server tonight so your going to have to wait!\"   15 percent has just been deducted from her tip I thought in my head.  So wait we did.  Finally, we got to ordering. We ordered 2 catfish ($13 with 2 sides), oxtail ($16+ with tax), 3 drinks ($2.15 each). Food was ok. I've had better soul food having been in the South recently and eating at Chicken Box in Charlotte,NC.  When we finally got around to paying, we never got a check, and were never told we would have to pay at the checkout window.  I asked my mom for my phone to use my calculator because I know I was going into battle (these places usually think money grows out of my ass because they think I'm a stereotypical high maintenance Asian girl). The man at the window totaled our order and charged me $66.00. I begged to differ. I got my handy dandy calculator and we should have been charged $52. He apologized and said he was confused because the server was yelling over him while calculating our order. BS!  Stay AWAY!",

It's a cute, small old house turned into a restaurant. There's not many seats. But, you can tell it's family run and food is authentic! Great Southern food in Arizona!",

    "text": "The quality vs value of this place has completely plummetted in recent times and I had a very disappointing visit a few weeks ago. I had met a couple of friends for lunch who had never been here before. Told them that it was one of the best soul food places I've ever been to, which at time of stating had been quite True. I've been coming here for about seven or eight years and I remember when the food used to cost $8.80 per plate - AND after your meal someone was always walking around offering the dessert of the day to everyone. Quaint and tasty and decently priced. Now, everything is almost double that, over $14 per plate. And the flavours have gone downhill. I told these guys the cornbread at Mrs White's was all-world. Out comes stale shitty cornbread that I guarantee was made the previous day - we got there at just after 11am so I KNOW it wasn't fresh. One of my friends asked for mac and cheese, they didn't have it. Also didn't have red beans and rice, which is what I normally order. Um, ok. I asked for smothered chicken. The other two asked for fried chicken. Out come three plates of fried chicken. I was too hungry to care. Then the guy comes out and says they DO have mac and cheese. Whatever. Collard greens aren't flavourful at all - almost like something steamed out of a Green Giant freezer pack. Fried chicken was okay, but not anything better than Church's and three times the price. And nobody offered any dessert, not that we would have had it anyway.  The bill for all three of us came to $48!! For basically something I could have cobbled together myself and I'm not even kidding. Kraft mac and cheese would have been tastier. Fried chicken takes a little while but isn't rocket science. Collard greens are a twenty-five cent side, and I almost broke my tooth on the cornbread. This place went from a treat to a disaster in one horrible visit. Won't be back unless and until they literally halve their prices and go back to the quality hole-in-the-wall they used to be. At least they accept credit cards now - only took them a half century to figure that out. And to top it off, their website is just as jacked up as their prices. 2 stars.",

It's a very simple place with a limited menu of fried chicken, pork chops, catfish and other basic Southern food.  The catfish dinner is one huge(!) slab of fish with a really tasty batter.  The okra gumbo, available only on weekends, is excellent (try a couple dashes of hot sauce to liven it up).  On top of that the prices are cheap.  Service is friendly, and while sometimes they get really packed and it's a bit slower, it's never bad.",

I enjoyed the chicken fried steak, with a side of collar greens, corn bread, and a fresh glass of lemonade to wash it down. I noticed alot of writing on the walls from some famous people, and I enjoyed the overall spirit of this place. Taylor greeted my uncle and myself, and quickly helped us find a booth to sit at. Carlos brought our food to us, and I was highly impressed at his soft nature and beautiful attitude. I am sold on this great place, and will definitely make an effort to visit this awesome place, whenever I visit phoenix!! Kudos to the whole  Mrs. White' s team!!",

    "text": "If I could give minus stars I would. The service there is the ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!!!  Now I am in the middle of packing to move to Portland but I am taking the time out to write this review because this is how bad this place is. I have been to Mrs. Whites on several occasions and the service has always been pretty crappy but today took the cake.   Breakdown of events:  1.Call in my order at 5:30pm. The woman that answered the phone had no business telephone etiquette at all.   2. Arrive at Mrs. Whites after going through the maze of the light rail and one way traffic...I digress that is not their fault. Anyway I walk in and I am cheerfully greeted by a young lady that is sweeping. A woman (I am sure the one that answered when I called is on the phone). She is on the phone with her boyfriend calling him out for cheating on her. Using all sorts of profanity while doing so.   3. I state that I am there for the to go order and that is it. No one says it will be a few more mins or anything. Now mind you I live on 10th St & Camelback so travel time to Mrs. Whites should have been sufficient time to prepare...fried fish, mac and cheese and mixed greens. 2 of the 3 dishes are cooked already I am sure.   4. I wait for about 10 mins when a older gentleman that works there reminds the phone lady that I am waiting for my order. I assume she is the cook. Well phone lady never even started my order. She did not start my order until 10 mins after I walked in the door and she was done calling out her boyfriend on the phone.  5. In my 30 mins of sitting and waiting. There were 5 employees there and the owner was one of them. He did not acknowledge me or anything and sat across from me watching tv and then left. Why does it take close to and hour to make my order with that many people there in the kitchen?  6. My food finally arrives, only to be dropped down in front of me...no words...just nothing. So I leave my  $10.18 for my meal as it states on the website since nobody came to take my money. Bad enough I have to wait for my food but I be da@#$ed if I will wait for you to come take my money. So I left.   7. I barely get my foot in the car and phone lady is out the back door saying that I did not pay the total for my meal. I said that the website said the meals were $10.18. She tells me that the price on the site is wrong the meals are now $14+. So I give the extra $4. Now why could she have not been that quick with making my food?  So save yourself the time and headache of this place. It is not worth it. I don't care how many celebrities or what Food Network show they were on. I have been to plenty of famous soul food places in Harlem NYC and never would anything like this ever happen.    If you have a jones for some soul food check out Lo Lo's in Scottsdale. The food is basically the same and the service is excellent.",

The staff was friendly and even sent me home with two extra pieces of chicken for later.  This place is awesome and I will for sure be a repeat customer.  Also whoever said KFC has chicken as good and it's cheaper well keep going back to KFC and stay outta places like this cause you don't belong.  Just sayin'.  KFC aint got nothin on Mrs. White.",

    "text": "DE-LI-CIOUS!!  I was about to leave for a road trip from the Bay Area all the way to Dallas. Of course, I noted all these places I wanted to stop to eat along the way.  At the last second, I decided to watch the episode of \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" in my DVR about fried chicken. Thank goodness I did!! Or else I would have never discovered this restaurant.  First off, they sell all their meals for $10.18 (plus tax). It comes with an entree and two sides. It's a HUGE plate of food. You could really eat it for two meals. The size of their drinks are monster, too. And for only $2.17! It'll make your plate full of food look small.  I went for their infamous southern fried chicken and sweet potato and green bean with potatoes for my sides. It was the best fried chicken I've ever had! There's just enough batter to chicken. The skin is crispy and the chicken is actually moist! I could pass on the green beans (they tasted like canned green beans), but the sweet potato was awesome. The sweet potato had just enough sweetness, but you have to ignore the (possibly heart stopping) liquid it sits in. Sometimes it better not to know how some stuff are made. =P  My hubby tried their chicken fried steak with rice and gravy and potato salad. The chicken fried steak has a flavorful, thick batter but it's still crispy. It totally looks homemade. The rice is your standard stuff, but the potato salad is yummy.   They're open 7 days a week, but they close early at 7PM, so plan an early dinner! But on Fridays and Saturdays they reopen at 9PM for their Late Night Munchiez session. It's a different menu and made up of burgers, wings and other good late night munchies.   Come here for the chicken first though. You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I have been visiting Mrs. White's going on 30 years, but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken, my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent Food Network recommendation - I almost got cold feet.  Good thing I didn't. The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. White's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. White's. If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. Mrs. White's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint won't work for you.  When you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes.   I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. White's was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but I'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. I'd just come back on another day.   To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. White's.  I love this place and hope I always will.",

It is soul food and home made fresh as you wait not sitting in a pan waiting to dish up so it takes some time to get your order.

Yummy I couldn't finish it all there was so much, lots of food for a lunch so be prepared to take home a container. Corn bread was a little dry but you are suppose to use it to soak up your gravy as they do in the south so remember that it is not to be eatin dry as I think most are trying to do.  Staff is not overly friendly but they are not rude by any means. Good home cooked food which are the basics of the southern soul cooking.  If your looking for a high priced upper scale place this is not it! It is home cooked food in a basic diner feel that you would find in Alabama or a small town in Georgia    Worth stopping by for good home cooked meal done southern style!",

    "text": "Mrs. Whites makes genuinely good food that you can't pass up!  If you live in Phoenix and have never tried it, you're doing yourself a disservice.  These guys are best known for their fried chicken, and for good reason!  It is always fresh and super crisp on the outside but nice and juicy on the inside.  It is cooked to absolute perfection.  It is handily some of the better fried chicken I have ever had.  I wish the batter they used for the coating had a bit more seasoning or spices since I like my chicken with a bit of a kick, but they have plenty of Louisiana Hot Sauce to dump all over it if that's your thing (it's often mine).  Chicken isn't all they do, however, and if you're just not in the mood for fried chicken, they have plenty of other southern staples to satisfy your appetite, including fish and pork chops.  They also have solid homestyle sides and very yummy cornbread.  On the weekends they make a knockout okra gumbo that is to die for.  The place itself is a dump, but that is actually a good thing in this case (at least to me).  It has tons of character and charm and it really feels like it has a history!  One tip: don't bother unless you're hungry.  The portions are huge.  REALLY HUGE.  I've never left here without a distended stomach...  It's not the cheapest place to eat in the valley (plan on nearly $20 for a lunch with tip), but the food is generally worth it, and if you're hungry enough to eat it all, it's a decent value.",

The tea tasted like my mom's. This is kind of a country hick place. Nothing fancy, far from it. Dingy and dirty; hasn't been cleaned in haw many years? There are a lot of autographs from famous people and athletes on the walls. The server (a nice young lady) was also the cook. If you are looking for ambiance this is not the place to go. If you are looking for good food, go to Mrs. Whites. There are no prices listed and I was a bit surprised at our bill. 2 dinners and 1 glass of tea and 1 glass of koolade (? spelling) $34.00 No breakdown of charges. All dinners are $15.00",

Rarely do I compliment others on their fried chicken (momma gets the top spot in my book) -- but I must admit, this place give my mother and grandma a run for their money.  And to top it off, the sweet potatoes are simply divine.  After you throw in some good old fashion sweet tea and moderate pricing, you know you've got a winner.   If you are looking for a trendy spot to dress up and people watch, this is not the place.  But if you are desperately in need of some down home southern treats, visit Mrs. White's.",

Mac n cheese I've def had better but it wasn't bad. Corn bread was not great at all...terrible. Can't believe they serve it...may be it was a bad batch? My friend had fried chicken greens and Mac n cheese. Fried chicken right on! But greens were awful. No flavor what so ever. Out of a can possibly? Waitress was odd and seemed to care about herself and the locals at the counter more than us, even tho we arrived well before them. Took a while for the food considering the joint was pretty empty. Worth the wait tho. I shall return!!!",

The staff was friendly and amazing that all entree dishes were $11.  Ordered the pork ribs and links with sweet potatoes, came with corn bread and ordered sweet tea.  The meat fell of the bone and the links were spicy.  The sweet potatoes were sweet and yummy and the greens, not too salty.

    "text": "I haven't had real, good soul food since I lived in New York and to be honest I never expected to find it in Arizona.  Mrs. White's was stumbled upon by pure happenstance.  A friend that had eaten here before, decided upon the Golden Rule as the best place to eat dinner before seeing the Diamondbacks play.    The menu is very simple, but that's never a bad thing when the food is as good as they offer here.  I ordered the chicken fried steak, macaroni and cheese, and green beans (with potato).  My order was delivered last out of our group, and the anticipation grew and grew as I saw my friends get their heaping plates of fried deliciousness.  When they placed my plate in front of me the first thing that shocked me was the sheer size of the portions.  Even the rim of the plate was covered in food.    It was refreshing to see chicken fried steak that wasn't pounded into a flat, tasteless filet.  The breading was crunchy, crispy, and crazy good.  Also excellent was the gravy that covered every inch of the steak.  The green beans were seasoned perfectly, but I do wish there had been more potato included.  And the mac n cheese, forget it.  Creamy, cheesy, a slight crunch thanks to the baking, and perfectly cooked noodles.  Easily the best I've had outside of my own house.  A few dashes of hot sauce over everything and I was in heaven.    Now I have yet to try Lo-Lo's, which I hear is the best in the valley, but Mrs. White's has set the bar very high.  Very high indeed.",

    "text": "OK This cafe surprised me. I rarely give 5 stars but I had to.  They say it on the sign \"great fried chicken and pork chops\" and they are right. I loved it.  I was never a fan of collard greens until today. These were not the best collard green I have ever ate but the best side dish I have ever eaten. I can't stop thinking about them. The deserts were to die for. I had 3. Yes 3 deserts. Bread pudding, peach cobbler, and banna pudding. All awesome. The fried chicken was one of the best and I have had many trips looking for the best fried chicken and to think I found this one by surprise. I like the way they serve you. It's called the golden rule because you tell the cashier what you ate and he pulls out some price from his head. Funny but it was fair. I did not care for the BBQ though. Sauce was great but the meat was not up to my standards. Braised not smoked. I think it should only be smoked with a dry rub. They do take credit but a charge is added.",

You will go into a food coma and take the best nap of your life afterward!\"  They didn't listen. And the food coma got them fired. Well it didn't, but they were so useless the rest of the day that they should have gone home anyways.   Chicken that could drowned a baby with it's juiciness! OH SO GOOD! Red beans, rice and gravy that made my heart beg for mercy after my blood pressure shot up to like, a million over eight hundred thousand...in a good way though. If you've ever gotten the meat sweats, it's a similar feeling. You finish eating, completely satisfied and relaxed, and then THE FUCKING FEVER COMES!! I don't think your body can handle what just got absorbed through your intestines, so it flips out. I went into fight or flight mode, hard, and I didn't come down until I slept it off like a food drunk little baby.   Like J.C.M. said, it hurt so good.",

Waitress and cook yelling at each other in the kitchen. Someone forgot one of our two orders. Insincere apologies followed.  Food was OK.

On my last visit I decided to go with the catfish and I was craving veggies so I waited on some greens and I also decided to try the cabbage. The greens were tasty, the cabbage...I guess I was kind of expecting a sauted/fried cabbage with a little more flavor, it was good but a little bland. The catfish on the other hand was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside moist on the inside and a nice big slab of it. Sooo good.  I rarely pass up the Kool-Ade, but occasionally get the sweet tea.   I have enjoyed my time there and usually go when I have plenty of time to enjoy my meal. While the food is served relatively quickly, I don't know that I would recommend it for someone looking for a quick downtown lunch time fix. For me if I am going to go enjoy some home cooking, I take my time and enjoy.",
