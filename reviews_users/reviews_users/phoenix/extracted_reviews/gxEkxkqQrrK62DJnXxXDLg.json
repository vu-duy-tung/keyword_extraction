    "text": "Smashburger is pretty good, even though the decor is terrible.   I have been there several times before this review, so I'll make just a general review.   The burgers are juicy and flavorful, I highly recommend the Arizona, and the BBQ Bacon burgers. Fresh meat, freshly cooked, perfectly seasoned. The egg buns are perfectly toasted and delicious.   As for the sides, don't go for the onion straws. You don't really get enough, and the flavor isn't anything spectacular. If you're craving them, grab the BBQ Bacon burger, which is the perfect combination.  The sweet potato fries are basically sweet potato fries, nothing special.   The veggie frites are where it is at. Lightly fried and delicious carrots, zucchini, and asparagus.   My only issue is that the sides could be a little more for what you pay.  Give it a try!",

I've been there twice, and coincidentally the same things have happened both times:  The cashier didn't know how to input a make your own burger, with chili, egg, and grilled onions (even though everything is on their list of ingredients to make your own)  The cook forgot my chili  They were out of silverware  I asked for a side of mayo which they forgot.  The most recent time, the burger and flavor of the meat was good, but it was a sloppy mess.  The 1/2 lb. patty dwarfed the bun, which was rendered useless.  When I did finally find the lower half of the bun it was a soggy and greasy.  My fries were cold and underdone.  Something seemed off too, as if the kitchen was short-staffed or inexperienced, as I saw orders going back and the food runners seemed confused.  I still *may* go back but I'd rather go to in-n-out like others have pointed out (not Five Guys though, I'd still rather have this than any food from that pit).",

I get the all american burger with cheddar instead of american, smash fries, and if I'm up for a caloric splurge - a chocolate shake.  You can tell that the smash fries were potatoes very recently, and they're coated in rosemary and sea salt rather than msg.  The burger is 3-napkin juicy and it's a REALLY good burger - not a cookie cutter disc with traces of freezer burn still clinging to it.  The egg buns are nicely squishy in the middle but still slightly crusty on the outside, and the veggies actually crunch when you bite into them.    And the Haagen Dazs milkshakes?  Yeah - those are real too.  Clearly blended from real ice cream, and a consistency reminiscent of those childhood specialties that bloomed from mom's blender when something awesome like The Wizard of Oz brought everyone together in front of the tv.    It's kind of a weird, chrome-sterile environment to be eating such a down home meal in... but I recommend eating at the tables along the sidewalk outside - gives it a picnic-like quality.",

The menu looked and sound great, just when the food came out I was disappointed.    Burger:  It is the thin flat, sonic style paddy.  Now I know why when we asked for medium they told us no.  I wash picturing more of the juicy thick burger cooked to order.  Fried:  There specialty is a olive oil and garlic fry.  They forgot to make mine the special way.  I mentioned something when my food came out.  You can tell they took my fries, dumped EVOO all over them and brought them out  Fried Pickles:  These were actually the  best, thin slices fried with a nice dipping sauce, I do recommend this  Milk Shake:  Okay it would have to be impossible to mess this up.  Haggen Daas ice cream....enough said  Long story short I see why people would like smashburger I just prefer a different kind of burger",

    "text": "This restaurant caused my boyfriend and I to get into an argument over whether preferring your burger well-done was wrong. He claims preferences can't be wrong. I claim they can. Examples of wrong preferences include: Preferring Hitler to Kittens, preferring Miley Cyrus to The Beatles, and preferring a 1/2 pound ground beef patty to be dry and tasteless as opposed to juicy and delicious. It's just wrong.  If, however, you are one of those who \"prefer\" well done burgers, like really, really well done burgers, Smashburger is the place for you.  It also helps if you prefer long wait times and cold fries. I would consider these preferences to be \"wrong\" as well, but who am I to say? It appears Smashburger has found a niche of followers with preferences very different from my own.  I realize that this location has just recently opened, so I'm going to cut them some slack with regards to the \"5-7 minute wait time\" that turned into 25. The employees did seem like they were working hard. The food window was extremely backed up while we were waiting in line to order, which made me nervous that our burgers would spend 10 minutes under a heat lamp before we received them. However, the staff seemed to catch up before our order was ready. Which makes it even weirder that my burger still tasted like it sat under a heat lamp for 10 minutes.  I'm being generous with my star rating because it may have been an off night, and I've heard some good things, but I can't see myself gambling with giving it another shot. I walked in craving a good burger, I left $24 poorer (for 2 people) and craving a good burger. Wrong.",

    "text": "*Gamestop Burger*  Visiting a friend in Phoenix I first see Smashburger from the street. Upon first glance my other friend and I thought it was a Gamestop cuz the sign looked just like it. We both said \"Haha, we thought that was a Gamestop.\" Our friend goes, \"Yeah I first thought that too when I first saw it. It's pretty good there. Do you guys wanna go?\"   So we ended up eating our first meal in Phoenix at Smashburger, and we were glad we did. The food was really good, and the smashfires were a great addition to our burgers.  I ordered the BBQ Bacon & Cheese. It was quite delicious, and a little on the greasy side. BUT that's where all the flavor is!!!!!  This burger has some hot steamy buns. Yeah I said it . Unlike most places that use the typical sesame seed bun Smashburger uses egg buns. These buns are a lot softer and compliment the burger very nicely.   I decided to order the smashfries which are seasoned with garlic and rosemary. These were an awesome choice. For those of you who may not like those flavors they offer regular fries as well.   Seeing that I hadn't eaten since morning I also ordered the Arizona devil dog. This had guacamole, tomatoes, jalapenos, habenero cheese and a spicy chipotle sauce all on an all beef hot dog. I liked it. It was like nachos minus the chips on my hot dog.   Now this place is on the pricey side, but if you feel like dishing out $8+ for a burger and fries then this place is not too shabby.   Different locations call for different items on the menu, so don't be surprised if the Arizona devil dog cannot be found outside of Arizona. I say that they should combine all the regional menus to make one giant-mega selection-awesomeness menu. But I highly doubt that'll happen.",

Arizona burger is delicious - as delicious as a fast food burger can get and they have gluten free buns which is a huge bonus! My kids love the mini-burgers and fries. My issue with this place, and a lot of other restaurants that we order take out from, is that they ALWAYS forget to give us our kids drinks. Maybe it's because I always request organic milk for my kids as part of their kids' meal and I know that's more expensive than asking for soda pop ... Who knows ... but I feel like it's a purposeful \"oops forgot your drink\" because every single time my hubby picks up an order the milk for my kids is forgotten. Our bad really as we should double check, but their bad for consistently failing to provide part of our meal.",

    "text": "After a heavy workout, I decided to take a friends advice & give this place a shot for the first time for my post-workout protein fix.... I usually don't \"experiment\" with my food after a workout because i'm usually EXTREMELY hungry at that point & I obviously want things to be right with my food during this critical \"post-workout\" time window... Needless to say, I knew I was taking a big risk here... As someone who needs to keep their carbs low, I generally eat my burgers &/or chicken sandwiches WRAPPED in lettuce (with no bun) & I never get fries, so the size/quality of the burger/sandwich patty is kind of a big deal or else i'm walking out hungry... The point when ordering it this way is that the lettuce takes the place of the bun, & common sense means that you wrap the lettuce further (in either paper or thin aluminum) in order to keep the sandwich from making a mess & falling apart in the person's hands... Because this should be common sense, I rarely explain all of this in full detail when ordering burgers &/or chicken sandwiches with lettuce & no bun (I expect that they would know)... For good measure, I called in advance to make sure I could order it this way & was told that I could.   I get there, place my order & take my seat to wait for my food. It comes out, & wow what an unpleasant surprise.... First off, they slapped the chicken patty over a thin slice of lettuce with tomato/onion & there was another piece of lettuce on the side but nothing to wrap around it so that I could actually make it into a wrapped sandwich (without making a complete mess & having it fall apart)... I literally had to wrap it up in a napkin just to keep it together, which is not something I enjoyed as the napkin was like toilet paper & it basically dissolved into the lettuce as I was eating it (as a result of the moisture from the patty/tomatoes/onions/etc)... Furthermore, what REALLY ruined my first-time dining experience was the fact that the chicken patty was so thin/flat I probably could have slid it through the crack under the front door & still had room left to fit my finger in-between the patty & the bottom of the door... Maybe I should have done more research in advance (in regards to how this place came up with it's ingenious name), but I was not aware that this place completely smashes the meat in their burgers/sandwiches to a point where it is almost paper thin... This is one reason why I don't like \"In-n-out\" Burger, because they do this with their burgers & if you get it on a bun YOU CANT EVEN TASTE THE MEAT (all you taste is BREAD)... I absolutely hate that, & to my dismay Smashburger seems to follow this same process: Needless to say that with that paper-thin patty & no bun/fries (both of which are carb-heavy), I walked out of the place just as hungry as I was when I walked in.   The chicken patty was probably a good 1.5-2 ounces (if that) once they got done destroying it & what a shame as it actually tasted quite good... But to pay close to TWELVE DOLLARS for a thin little chicken patty+medium drink & STILL walk out hungry? That's unacceptable & bad business... The place is a complete ripoff as far as i'm concerned & while I may give the milkshakes a shot someday, I definitely won't be ordering any more chicken sandwiches or burgers there. Yeah it tastes good, but if you're walking out of there just as hungry as you were when you came in, that's a problem. I'll spend my money elsewhere or just make it myself (plenty of copycat recipes online) & i'll actually feel like I ate a meal because I won't squash it to death... For those reading this, if you want an AWESOME burger that will absolutely fill you (even if you get it wrapped in lettuce like me), give \"The Stand\" a shot on Indian School Rd. AWESOME, reasonably priced & you'll definitely be full (& no I don't work for them, I just eat there often as I live in the area). MORAL OF THE STORY: When in doubt, STICK WITH WHAT YOU KNOW!!!!",

    "text": "12/22/10  Yelp offered Yelp members a chance to eat here for free, and hooray, I was one of the lucky few!  (Was a bit confused at first as this \"event\" was not organized like other meet-and-eat Yelp events; I was just supposed to mention to the cashiers that I was on the Yelp list- no big deal.)  Had the BBQ, Bacon, and Cheese burger and \"sweet potato smashfries.\"  Had to wait a bit on the fries, as the deal only included their regular \"smashfries\" (rosemary, garlic, and olive oil).  [FYI, other side fries' options were Haystack Onions and Veggie frites (flash-fried asparagus, carrots, and green beans- all sound great to me, except I'm allergic to carrots.  And maybe green beans.  LOL.)]  After finally trying the soggy sweet potato fries, I'd wished I'd stuck w/ the regular smashfries, which were actually tasty and nicely-crisped!)  The burger is definitely \"smashed,\" and it was definitely greasy, but, oh was it delicious!  Really loved the added crispy onions strings, too.  I had them put the BBQ sauce on the side (didn't know what ingredients were used to make it), so I can't review that.  Honestly, though, w/ the cheese, shoestring onions, crispy thick-cut bacon, and, of course, the grease, there's no need for the BBQ!    The meal also included a free fountain drink and a sample of two choices of mixed-in ice creams (something akin to TCBY shivers, DQ's blizzards, and Ted Drewes' concretes).  I chose the butterfinger (yes, I know these cornflaked candies are off-limits to me, and perhaps the Haagen-Daaz ice creams, too-- some varieties have corn syrup and cornstarch in them), but I like Butterfinger, and so I dove in!  The 4 oz. sample was very, very good!  Great, even!  Too bad I couldn't eat the whole thing (the less allergens consumed, the better!), but I sooooooo wanted to, though!  Service was quick and efficient.  Friendly, too!  And the women's restroom was clean and fresh, and the dining area, while a little crowded, was also clean.  There's not a lot of fast-food places I'll go eat at willingly, but I definitely would not turn up my nose at Smashburger!",

All was well until I went to return to my table after getting my drink... The floor was wet and I slipped. Luckily, I was able to catch myself on a nearby booth!  I informed one of the workers that the floor was wet and I had slipped, her response, \"Oh, it is probably this rug, sorry about that.\" So she put a caution wet floor sign up and went about her business. My food came, however, I was missing my milkshake. I informed the worker (same one as before) she seemed a little irritated.... But promptly made and delivered my shake. The food and shake were delicious  as always.   Unfortunately, putting out the sign was the only action taken to the wet floor and another customer slipped and this time actually fell to the floor. I immediately asked if she was ok, and informed her that I did the same thing! She told another employee about what happened, their solution was... To move the wet floor sign! Yet again. The other lady who slipped and fell got the manager and then someone finally came out to clean up the puddle. If the food wasn't so good their stars may have been lower!   Puddles on the floor are not to be ignored! It's a safety risk.",

But when offered the chance to try something new for free, I couldn't say no (I'm stubborn, not stupid).   Enter Smashburger. The logo looks like they bought their logo design from the same designer that made Gamestop's, but they definitely don't play any games with their burgers. Surprisingly, all of the ingredients on my Arizona burger looked and tasted absolutely fresh! By fresh, I even mean that the jalapenos looked sliced, in house, and were as green as you'd get them from the supermarket. Also, the patty looked (was not a perfect circle) and broke apart like real ground beef! Those kind of little touches makes me happy. With my AZ burger, I got the smash fries (fries tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic), and they hit the spot. They were full of flavor without being soggy or greasy.  I gotta hand it to Smashburger, it's not bad. I would definitely come here on lunch breaks occasionally if I didn't work in North Scottsdale; I think it would be a perfect place for that. But I am sure I'll be back to dine here at some point. I think Fred M nailed it when he said, \"This place is to burgers what Chipotle is to burritos...\" It's a chain restaurant that wants to provide the type of fast food that is more appreciated nowadays - fresh (but not frozen), fast (but not microwaved) and filling (but not because you super-sized it).",

They sell beer and fountain soda to help you wash down your burger and accoutrements.  My wife and I both got the Classic, a burger with \"Smash sauce\" (described by the counter clerk as a mixture of mayo, mustard and pickle relish), lettuce, onion, pickle, and tomato. The burgers were:  1. Obviously fresh, not frozen, meat - this was apparent by the odd shape of the meat. 2. Juicy and not overcooked. 3. Seasoned well  We were both happy with our burgers.  The garlic and rosemary fries were good, when hot. When they cooled down, the flavor became almost cloying. Maybe it's just because I am not too big a fan of rosemary. Nonetheless, an interesting take on fast food fries.  I was not too unhappy with the price tag. Two burgers and fries for $14. Seems pretty standard to me. The atmosphere of the place is kind of sterile. It's not a place to grab a burger, have a few beers and hang out. As I said, we were traveling through, so it met our needs well for this visit and I would likely return.",

The menu seemed a bit limited save the build your own burger option, which in hindsight, I probably should've tried. Instead, I had the truffle mushroom burger, my GF had the bacon ranch burger. We also shared an order of fried pickles and Smash fries. The guy at the register was nice enough to comp our drinks when we ordered. Maybe he could tell it was our first time there, but whatever the reason it was a nice gesture. Unfortunately, now come the negatives. The food overall was just OK. Jack In The Box's Butter Mushroom burger was better than my truffle mushroom. My GF didn't remark on her burger one way or the other. We've had better fried pickles too. These were a bit greasy and the breading was tasteless. The Smash fries were similarly unimpressive. We really thought the thyme and sea salt would add a punch of flavor, but it proved not to be the case. The quality of the fries themselves were subpar as well. The saving grace for the meal was the fact that we could immediately tell that the burger patties themselves were fresh and well seasoned. It's the first time I've had a burger, fast-food or otherwise, that tasted like a home-made burger.  We will try Smashburger again, hopefully the build your own option will prove to live up to all the rave reviews given to this place. Props to the friendly and hard working staff.",

You order, pour your own drink, then take your number and put it on your table and your meal is served to you with a smile. It gets busy at lunch hour but the staff deals with the rush pretty efficiently.   During my most recent visit, someone in my party got a chicken salad with no chicken in it. When she told the manager about this, he promptly offered to grill her a chicken breast and apologized. On her way out, the manager also presented her with a coupon for a free sandwich on her next visit.   Accountability. Nice!",

    "text": "This Smashburger reminds me why I thought I didn't really like Smashburger until I tried the one at Tempe Marketplace and then encountered the pure bliss of the ASU location.  How, you ask, is this Smashburger different from the Smashburgers of joy and repletion? First, it lacks the large menu board placed where the line forms. The lighted board up behind the counter is barely readable when you're at the counter, with the result that people squint and dither and have no idea what they're doing. Despite the cheerfulness of the counter personnel, ordering starts on the wrong foot.  Second, there is something peculiar about the kitchen set-up. On the rare occasions when I've ordered take-out, it has taken forever (with eat-in people behind me served first) and that was apparently the case this time, as the clerks were apologizing to waiting take-out customers. The cluster of sulky people near the pop machines does not help the mood.  Third, the food is just okay. I mean, it's better than the Wendy's across the street, and I certainly whiffled it down; but now I get why people have been raving over The Stand.  Fourth, dear god, people, LET ME FINISH MY MEAL. I was attempting to work on a story at my laptop while eating. I was not taking an unduly long time over it, and the place had no lack of empty tables. Clerks were so thoroughly all over me, trying to clear my tray when I visibly wasn't done, that I checked my reflection to make sure a bad-hair day wasn't making me look homeless or something.   I would NEVER eat-in at this location again, and only under dire conditions of hunger would I go to it again. Even though the food is decent, the experience is so fretful that it's not relaxing or pleasant.",

Burgers from other restaurants & burger joints are warm to cold, but not Smashburger!!! You order at a counter and they bring the food to you at a table and your table is even bussed.  The burger was tasty & delicious! Their Smashfries, tossed with rosemary, garlic & olive oil are to die for! They're thin, not big/thick and were perfectly cooked!  They even have sandwiches and salads. If I have the same experince whenever I go back to try something different, I will give them five stars!",

It was 3... :)   Food was very good. I was nervous about the \"egg bun\"... but it looked really tasty. (Which it was.) The cheese was nicely melted on my 1/3lb patty.   The onion strings were certainly tasty, but they were pretty messy to eat. And I don't remember there being any silverware. So yes to the mess -- and good to eat.

Unless of course you love the taste of grease because that's all the burger tasted like to me. I think their whole gimmick is to \"smash\" the flavor out of the meat and sop up all the grease flavor.   I tried the Smashfries too and meh. They tasted like frozen shoestring fries thrown in the over. They were not appetizing.  Definitely not a fan and will likely never go back.",

So nice to know that you can get real, fresh,        veggies at a fast food joint. We went back and got a 2nd order.  Chicken salad was 5 stars for a fast food joint.  The burger was good, not great. Tasted slightly greasy. Bun was yummy.  I ordered the regular fries (supposedly like McDonald's original). They were ok. Could have been hotter. I guess I am getting spoiled by fries that are more like 5 Guys (fresh cut, skin on).  I had a coke float with Hagan Daz vanilla ice cream in it. Very generous portion of ice cream and I got to add my own coke and keep refilling as many times as I wanted. I thought that was awesome.   My obvious comparison to 5 guys is because these are really the only 2 burger chains that are a cut above all of the rest. (Sorry In and Out, these 2 are better)  So, 5 Guys wins on the burgers and fries, but Smashburger wins in all other areas because they have ice cream, not to mention it is Hagan Daz, my favorite, milkshakes and more variety of food choices on the menu and a lot of those are healthy options.",

One small snag when I found a hair on my burger (eww) but the staff went WAY above and beyond in rectifying the situation.  Not only did they give us a coupon for a free burger (you have to pay in advance at the counter so this was easier than removing it from the check), they remade the fries so we wouldn't have to eat cold fries while waiting for the new burger.  At least four employees stopped by the table to make sure we were happy with the solution.    I'll definitely be back!",

I was really excited to eat there.   We arrived with about 15+ people and the service was great. The guy \"KIRBY\" at the cash register was quick and new pretty much all the answers to the questions everyone asked.   I had the BUILD YOUR OWN... Chicken burger. I made a mistake of getting 2 sauces on one burger but that is not why they only got 3 stars.   I gave them 3 stars because I guess I expected more. I didn't get a burger but when I seen the burgers that were being served I'm glad I got my chicken. The patties were really skinny (not plump and juicy) ... maybe thats why they are called smash burger, because the burger literally looked like it was smashed to its thinnest life span.   But I would go back and try their burgers, but it was just OK for me.... If the second time around I go and its just \"OK\"... I probably would just stick to IN & OUT or Burger Lounge!  :) Happy smashing...",

It came on an egg bun and was DELICIOUS!  I also split an order of the smash fries, great fries with olive oil, garlic and rosemary. They were great too. I enjoyed my meal so much I went to another location by my house for lunch again over the weekend. The sandwiches were inconsistent, but both good. Teh service was good at both locations and the prices were great. Teh sandwiches were $7.00 and well worth it. The fries were $2.

    "text": "The name Smash Burger reminded me of a cook angrily smashing the patties in the kitchen ;)  I went there twice already and finally decided to give a review:  The burger is truly great, juicy, and you have a WIDE array of choices of toppings/sides  to put on it even though the menu looks simple. (for example, fried eggs ;) )   the rosemary garlic fries.....Mmmmm....sorry i was drooling thinking about it. It is divine to say the least.    Customer service is great the both time I was there too. The price might seem a tad high for a burger place but it is worth every penny.   TL;DR version: if you want an awesome burger, come here. If you want a quick fix of burger, go to In n Out.  hope this has been useful",

Honestly, I love burgers & sweet potato fries, but I never want to eat at this place again. How does a place with burger in its name serve such a lame burger?",

Expo, bussing, jumping on the register, spinning shakes, greeting guests, WOW! She even stopped to ensure that a lady who was sitting alone was taken care of and went out of her way to make her an ice water with lemon and deliver it to the table! She is the epitome of GREAT HOSPITALITY!",

I got the bacon burger sans bun to make it more gluten free friendly (just remember to have the onion thingys removed too since they're breaded). Also got the smash fries, which are rosemary and olive oil, which are the best fries ever! Overall, I thought the whole experience was great. Staff was attentive and friendly, the burger was really flavorful and it was a really clean and inviting atmosphere.   We tried the butterfinger shake, which I wasn't a huge fan of, just because the texture had a weird fluffy thing going on. I like my shakes thick, so this is just a me thing.   I'll be back for sure since it's right up the street for me. Great job Smashburger!",

I finally made it there to try it out and I am glad that I did. The fries and sauce were great as well. Big burger, fries, soda all for about $9. It is certainly worth every penny. Just writing this review makes my mouth water. You order up at the counter and they bring the food to your table. The area that it is in is very affluent and land leases are expensive.

I didn't see anything out of the ordinary in their offerings.    I was excited for their sweet potato fries when I ordered them.  Wasn't so excited to eat them.  They were doused in olive oil and rosemary.  I'm a rosemary purist and don't think you are required to cook with a lot of it to get the flavor out of it.  Too much rosemary is a bad thing -- it overpowers everything and you lose the other flavors in translation.    Their burgers were ok.  But lets face it, how hard is it to mess up a burger.    I wish places would quit buttering buns.  I can't ever remember to tell them not to butter it and I think the butter actually mutes the taste of the sandwich.    Smashburger wasn't my favorite.  Don't think I'll be dining there again.    I rank it slightly ahead of Culvers.  Mad the mistake of going back here.  Hated even worse the second time.  Guess I'm just not a fan.",

The lady at the counter was able to answer all of my questions and give me her recommendations, which was really helpful. After we ordered we sat down at our table and talked, and when our food was ready they brought it to our table rather than making us go get it. They also came by and asked us if we needed anything and brought us some refills. When you are done eating you just leave your trays on your table, which is really nice.   The Arizona burger was great! It was the perfect combination of flavor and spice.  I also got the sweet potato fries and they were super good and salty.

We had been to another Smashburger location in the past and enjoyed it. So we stopped by this location thinking we'd receive the same service. Not even in same hemisphere! Walked in and immediately a young guy nearly ran us over trying to run out to the parking lot. He had a distinct smell of weed which initially didn't concern me until everything that happened next. There was no one at the counter. We heard yelling and slamming of kitchen equipment from the back but nobody was upfront. A few minutes later, a young man with \"manager\" on his name tag emerged quite rattled and coughing. We tried to give him our order nearly half a dozen times, but he couldn't get through it without massive coughing bouts. I finally grabbed a to-go cup and got him some water and asked if he needed help or wanted me to call someone. He just shook his head no violently while chugging down the water. He finally got the order in and we went to get our drinks. I heard some muffled yelling in the back again but didn't think much of it until my daughter motioned me closer to the door to listen. Her jaw was on the floor. Soon enough I understood why. We heard at least 2 guys in the back cussing and screaming about how they were going to spit in our food and \"fu@! them\" and more slamming. I immediately went to the counter and cancelled our order. The \"manager\" asked why which was beyond baffling and I told him I heard everything and I want my money back. He just said sorry a bunch of times. We left and will NEVER return.",

This place \"Rocks!\" I don't eat red meat so there is options for those who have a creative diet. Yep, you can even build your own sandwich. The SMASHChicken that is flavored very well served grilled or crispy. I prefer grilled then I load it with all the yummy toppings they have to offer. Fresh raw or grilled toppings. With your choice of cheese or sauce. You can also choose your bun. Different flavors or have it wrapped in lettuce.  Now back to the sides. Those Fried Pickles make me say \"hmmmm,hmmmm, good!\" I tried the Onion Strings for the 1st time today and they are mighty tasty. I was not a big fan of their regular small cut fries because I like flavor but the Rosemary Smash Fries are beyond good. Then they have Sweet Potato Fries that are also good.  The price point for the portions they offer are good. Enough to leave you full or walkout with a doggy bag. They serve desert. I have yet to attempt to eat any because I fill upon my food I haven't room after. lol!  Best customer service. I have never seen an employee look unhappy. Your always greeted with a smile and your always thanked when you leave. The restaurant is always clean with fast service. I admire the managers they are friendly and actually work. Yes, besides greeting they are working with the line cooks, using the register or delivering the goods.   I am very impressed. SMASHBurger is beyond fast food.

The mushroom has a good sauteed and the burger was very juicy and tasty.  You can tell they really marinated the beef well.  It reminds me of Zin Burger in a way that the beefs are tender and juices splash out as you bite into it.  I don't really care for the fries that much.  It was little greasy and salty. The price is reasonable. Also, definitely need to wash your hands after eating the big juicy burger.  =)",

I opted to build my own burger and went with a 1/2lb. burger on the chipotle bun with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, mustard, and chipotle sauce.  I'm not a fan of a lot of spices on my fries so I went with the regular.  A cold cherry coke made my meal complete.  I was told it would be 5-7 minutes before my order was ready, and not more than five minutes later, it was brought out to our table.  Not only was the presentation really nice, but the burger was out of this world!  It was cooked just as I like it (well-done) and was really hot and juicy.  The fries were good on their own, but paired with the chipotle sauce, they were near perfect.  The awesome food coupled with the friendly, efficient service ranks Smashburger up in my top three favorite burgers in town.  Well done!",

Carl's Jr. and Jack in the Box have been in a burger arms race for the last couple of years and the quality of the fast food burger has only improved. These burgers are well done BUT they are so juicy and tasty. One Yelper criticized Smash because the burgers were well done, but this is not fair. Nobody should be eating medium to rare ground beef unless it is from a single fresh cut of meat and ground up just prior to frying. Under cooked steaks are safe to eat, but undercooked ground beef is not. I love Smashburger because they have Haagen-Dazs milkshakes and serve them in a thick shake glass with the extra bit in a cold steel cup, like they do in diners. This is a step or two above the average burger joint, and if you like diners and burger joints, you really should go see for yourself.",

It sucks for the businesses, but I assure you it has nothing to do with Smashburger alone nor should it cause any health concerns. Just luck of the draw on a bad sewer vent problem.  Update: 4/18/10 Went again. Really very good. Decor is still not my fav but the food is solid. Like I said, it is the juiciest burger I have had in a while. Shoestring fries are kill.

I'm not really sure if this place is considered fast food, but compared other burger places I frequent it was definitely the most expensive.  I built my own burger, and I like my burgers pretty simple.  The burger was disappointing though, size was good for a single patty, but I could probably have gotten a double for the same price at any other place.  The actual patty was pretty bland, the rest of the toppings and bun were pretty good, but without a good patty they can only go so far.  The fries were also kind of bland.  They were advertised with rosemary and garlic on them.  I've had good garlic fries and these were nowhere close, I got a faint hint of garlic, not a wake up all my senses amount of garlic that I was hoping for.  Overall the price was the real killer.  If I could have gotten my order for 5 dollars less I would consider going back, but there are better burgers out there for less money.",

    "text": "Ok, So first off by saying, I don't eat red meat so perhaps the burger Gods were punshing me for going to a burger joint for a chicken sandwich...but I had a jalepeno chicken sandwich craving and without a carls Jr near by decided to try this place at the recomendation of my co worker.  I'll say the pro's first: Very curteous phone manners, took my order to-go over the phone, repeated my order to me, gave me an accurate time estimate and a total, and thanked me repeatedly. So can't fault the customer service.  Once I arrived, I waited in quite a long line. The place was packed.  12:30 peak lunch time was probably a busy time and I was thankful I had called my order ahead.  As I looked around my mouth watered at the delicious looking burgers and fries on everyones plates.  I cursed myself for not ordering the rosemary fries.  Oh well.  I paid and recieved my sandwich promptly.   When I opened the box, I eyed my burger before taking the first bite.  The first thing I noticed was the sandwich was incredibly light.  The second thing I noticed is, there was no chicken?  I looked closely and discovered a literaly paper thin strip of chicken breast.  Now, I am going to assume that I got an unusally small portion of chicken and move on, because it was literally so skimpy I debated going back.  But here's what made up for it, the rest of the ingrediants where so tasty and fresh I forgave the childsize portion of chicken.  I had fresh (not jarred) jalepeno's, spicy habernero cheese, nice chipotle sauce, soft warm bun, and fresh lettuce and tommato.  Perhaps this place is not the right place to go for a chicken sandwich, knowing they are famous for the meat. The next time I want a jalepeno chicken I'll probably opt for a place like Carls Jr that I can trust to give me a good size peice of chicken.  After eating from Smashburger, I was still a little hungry (having skipped breakfast anticipating a nice hearty lunch), but I'll thank them instead for keeping the calorie count down so I can stay nice and slender. Probably not worth the 6.99 I paid but all and all very tasty, and excellent customer service, hence the three stars.",

For $10, I thought they should have asked.  The food was hot and tasty, I just didn't find it visually appealing for the price.  For a couple bucks less I'd rather go to Culvers.  The decor is minimalist and feels very corporatized.  My friend who suggested the place asked if they actually grilled their burgers and we found out they use 80/20 ground beef.  That was also a bit surprising but then they seemed a little on the greasy side.  I'd come back again, but seems like these places are a dime a dozen.

And until the end of Feb, they have LV's sin city burger. Do not miss out on this. Best selling burger in all SmashBurger stores nationwide. Also, this camelback location won franchise of the  year in 2010. be on the lookout for the SmashMobile driving around.",

Not only were we not greeted as we entered the restaurant, our cashier was not very attentive when we had questions about the menu. As we finish our order, we go to get drinks. Not only was the lemonade out and the tea was also brown water, we alerted the staff but no sense of urgency seemed to arise. As we got out food, it was mediocre. The employee who brought our food also had no sense of enthusiasm or willingness to be working. Check out the sign on the lemons, use by 10/11 today's the 12th. My bun was not fresh like they used to be, kind of stale. Will not be coming back",

I went back to my car and sat there for a few minutes and I came back about about 5 minutes later, so maybe 1008AM or so, still no changes, both doors are locked still. I saw someone in there standing by the cash register.   I had to go get my food at subway instead. Very disappointing when you go to a place of business and their doors are locked and it is past the time their doors are supposed to be open and there are no signs on the door giving any reason for them not being open.

We learned that Smashburger locations have regional burgers and was so excited to try the Arizona burger here. I ordered the Arizona burger, a PB&J shake (as always) and Smash Fries- which come free if you fill out the survey on a Smashburger receipt.  The Arizona burger comes with a 1/3 lb patty, fresh Jalapenos, Chipotle Mayo, Habenero Cheese, Guacamole, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion sandwiched between a Chipotle Bun. Spice lovers, you will enjoy this burger. It was juicy, spicy and had tons of flavor. It is a hefty burger, but I managed to eat the whole thing!   The PB&J shake is always my fave here since it has Strawberry and Nutter Butter blended into one drink.   The Smash Fries are okay if you're looking for simple, thin cut fries. They are tossed with rosemary, garlic and olive oil but is very light in flavor.  The service here is by far the best in terms of dining at a Smashburger location, the cashier accepted my survey code and even checked up on us twice while we were enjoying our meal. Now that's service for a burger chain!",

    "text": "Not a great visit as Smashburger today. I've had Smashburger before though that was a straightforward cheeseburger and fries. Today I went for the Arizona Burger (habanero cheese, chipotle mayo, guacamole, jalapenos) and the smashfries.  The burger was properly cooked and tasty. I wasn't a big fan of the Arizona burger style - four small, thin (but fresh) jalapenos weren't really enough for the burger and the whole preparation overpowered the burger, in my opinion. I probably would've preferred it without the guac and with more jalapenos.  Smashburger has great fries but today's smashfries were luck licking a rosemary stalk - I couldn't taste anything else. I really enjoy garlic fries, and I like rosemary on some potato dishes, but I couldn't taste anything but rosemary. Tried dipping them in ketchup to offset the flavor with no luck.  They do brew their own iced tea which is a big plus with me.  $11.50 for a 1/2 lb burger, fries and drink? Bit pricey but not too bad if you share the fries with someone.  I'll be back but it will be for a more traditional cheeseburger and fries.",

    "text": "I just ate lunch here a couple of hours ago and I am so upset and disappointed in my experience that I feel the need to write this review. This is one of the worst meals I've ever had and it's a clear reminder why I avoid Smashburger, and why I won't be dining here in the future.    The first impression wasn't a good one. The restaurant smelled bad and greasy and was absolutely filthy. I'm talking straw wrappers and crumbs all over the place, leftover food sitting on the majority of the tables, and a floor that appeared it hadn't been swept nor mopped in days. I picked up a menu to decide what I wanted to eat the menu was filthy too, with a huge chocolate smear on it like somebody had dropped their milkshake on it. Not one employee noticed this and put it back for everyone to touch. My hands got sticky and it was disgusting. I did tell the cashier and he was very apologetic and went to clean it off.   I ordered the Avocado Club Grilled Chicken sandwich and made it a combo with a drink and I upgraded to sweet potato fries. I waited an unusually long time for my food (over 15 minutes) although the restaurant wasn't busy at all.   First issue: the Coke Zero syrup was out. I told two employees and who appeared to be the manager. They acknowledged me but never fixed the syrup. I was stuck drinking the iced tea and something was definitely not right with that, it had an unpleasant taste like something was old or wrong with the water. I wouldn't have ordered a combo if I knew I wouldn't be able to have my soda of choice.   Second issue: My chicken sandwich, once it finally arrived, was a letdown. The grilled chicken was hot and the avocado fresh, but the bun tasted and felt stale. The worst was the bacon that was slapped on my sandwich. It was inexcusable to serve bacon like this to a customer. It was barely cooked and all fat and was NASTY. See my photos, it was inedible. What's the point of paying $14 for a lunch when you can't even eat the elements that make it a club sandwich in the first place?  Third issue were my sweet potato fries. They were OLD, COLD and GROSS. The portion size was very small, thank goodness, because these were the worst potatoes ever. They also had a garlic taste to them which makes me think the kitchen wasn't too careful and had them next to the other fries. We all know that old and cold fries are bad, but the kitchen staff just doesn't seem to care.  I am super upset about this meal and I should've asked for a refund and left, but a line started to form and I doubt anyone would've cared about my issues anyway. After lunch I read more Yelp comments and there are some similar experiences just like the one I had. Something is seriously wrong with this location, and I hope the corporate office will send someone to intervene, terminate this franchisee's agreement, or just close the place down and put it out of its misery.",

    "text": "This used to be my favorite burger joint but they have changed, and not for the better. Their menu has changed and things that made them unique are no longer available. Their burger patties are suddenly smaller, they no longer offer malts (which was a big deal to me) they don't offer the habanero pepper jack any more. Their vegetables that they use for the burgers no longer seem as fresh. The buns are no longer the same either. They are now just an average, boring, run of the mill fast food joint with no character to speak of. I will say, the employees are still nice and handle my disappointment at all the changes in menu items, flavor, and portion size well. But seriously, Smash Burger Sucks now and to me, that sucks. I do have a tip for the corporate shitbags who decided to make these changes, sometimes it's better to just keep riding the wave and not fix what's not broken",

Smashburger offers a variety of burgers from which to choose, including build-your-own options. Smashburger has a variety of unique  side dishes, to compliment your burger.  In addition to the traditional fries offered at most burger places, Smashburger offers sweet potato fries, smashfries tossed with olive oil, garlic and rosemary, haystack onions, deep fried pickles, and veggie frites which are flash-fried carrot sticks, green beans and asparagus.  The service is pleasant, the ingredients are fresh and the food is cooked to order; if you're familiar with either In-N-Out Burger or Five Guys Burgers, the food here is arguably of similar caliber.",

I was completely smitten when I first visited the one in Tempe a while ago, but the long distance relationship was just too much.  Now that Smashburger is closer to my 'hood, we can see each other more often.    We went for their VIP grand opening, and everything went surprisingly well!  They were utterly jam-packed but the crowd was appeased with shake samples while we waited for our free food.  Of course it was delicious.  You can't go wrong with the BBQ Bacon burger.  We have since been quite a few times, and they are consistent with the first.  I always get a delicious burger that is cooked well but still incredibly juicy.  The bacon actually adds to the burger in both texture and flavor.  The haystack onions really set this burger apart from the rest though.  They add flavor, texture, and a perfect savory finish to every bite.  I love the veggie fries, especially when I get lots of asparagus.  The olive oil rosemary fries have actually gotten better since the opening.  I think they have lightened up on the OO, which is a good idea.  Smashburger is pretty tight with me, although my pants don't appreciate it.  We'll have to see where our relationship goes once Smashburger moves in less than a mile from my house.  I hope I don't get too clingy.",

    "text": "Went to @smashburger for a @PHXtastecasting event.  Our hosts, Kurt and Christina, were amazing. Very informative, and very helpful in guiding us through both the menu, as well as the background of the restaurant and the company.  I have never been to a burger joint that offered a fried egg, to go on your burger, so I of COURSE had to get it.  I went with the 1/2 Lb. Arizona Smashburger; Habanero cheese, guacamole, chipotle mayo, and jalapenos, on a chipotle bun, with added Applewood Smoked Bacon, and the aforementioned fried egg.  The burger patty was so big, it literally eclipsed the bun! The egg was a beautiful addition! I put the top bun on and SMASHED!!!  First bite was AMAZING!!!  Personally, I would not have the guac, as I think it detracts from the heat of the habanero and chipotle too much, but I definitely enjoyed the burger!  I would also not get this particular burger with the egg, as it doesn't, in my mind, mesh well with the other ingredients. Perhaps WITH the egg, but WITHOUT the guac, might improve it.  The smashfries are pure goodness! Tossed with garlic oil, rosemary, garlic, and other herbs, they were fantastic!  The haystack onions were delicious, but I didn't have enough to say more about them.  One of the menu items that sets Smash Burger apart, are their veggie frites; flash fried asparagus, carrot sticks, and green beans.  SOOOOOO GOOOOOOOD!!!!!!  Served ranch dressing, but not at all needed.  We were able to sample both the chocolate, and strawberry shakes.  Both were delicious, but the strawberry stood out as being something more than you can get at BK or Jack in the Box. Really good.  They also have salads available, and all of their burger items can be \"smashchicken\" orders, but really, what's the point?  They have a selection of beer and wine available, which is kind of unique for a burger joint. The beer selection is very nice, offering amber and hefeweizen choices, as well as some more mainstream selections.  I am, without a doubt, a fan. I wish I lived closer, but it isn't too far away.",

The sandwich was really good and I especially liked the sauce that came on the side. It was like a zesty cross between thousand island and ketchup. I liked that the chicken was grilled and not breaded. My fiance had the Arizona burger with a side of french fries. He said it was really tasty. It came with guac, chipolte mayo, pepper jack cheese and jalapenos.   We got our food to go so we could head home to watch the Suns game. We didn't have to wait very long at all and the employees were very friendly. The patio is a bummer view of the Best Buy/ Fryes parking lot. But the inside is exceptionally clean and the service is fast.   There are so many restaurants in this area but I like this place because you get a decent burger at a good price minus the drama. You don't have to valet park or watch people trying to look cool while eating a burger. We will be back!",

    "text": "We recently came here after hiking Camalback Mountain and I have to say that the burger and fries that I ordered definitly hit the spot.    As a first time visitor to Smashburger I decided to go with the Arizona Smashburger which is Habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, onion, chipotle mayo and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun.  It also comes with tomatoes, but I don't do tomatoes because I think they are disgusting.  Don't get me wrong, I like tomato sauce...unless of course it has big chunks of tomatoes in it.  I like salsa, unless it also has big chunks of tomatoes in it or if it tastes too much like fresh tomatoes.    Well anyway this burger was pretty freagin good and I highly recommend it as a fast food option.    I also ordered the smash fries which were a perfect compliment to my burger!",

The burger was flavored nicely, slightly greasy the way a good burger should be. The bacon, onion straws, BBQ sauce, and cheese topped off the burger nicely.  The Smashfries were a pleasant surprise. They're regular fries tossed with rosemary, garlic, and olive oil. Unlike a lot of special fries at places, the flavor was excellent and not overpowering, and they were only 30 cents more than the normal fries.  I didn't do a dessert this time, so I'll have to try one next time.",

The restaurant was about half full and the wait for our food did seem a little long, but I'm always happy to wait if the food is good and you can see that the staff is all working hard.  I probably wouldn't go here if you are on a tight lunch schedule.  The decor is modern.  It's okay.  It is a step up from McDonald's but definitely a step down from Delux or Zinburger, which are just down the street.  Our burgers were good.  I felt like mine was a little under-cooked.  I think that it would be advantageous for them to cook their burgers to order.  The price is high enough and the wait is long enough that it should be made to order.    All-in-all, it was a pleasant experience.",

I got the BBQ, Bacon, Onion String, & Cheddar Burger with SmashFries.  The egg bun (that's the only kind I buy for home) is grilled and quite tasty.  Burger was delicious, though the bacon wasn't quite cooked enough and was difficult to gnaw through.  The fries were quite good, but left me wanting some sort of aioli to dip them in.  Properly cooked bacon & a custom fry sauce would merit 5 stars but I will definitely be back.",

It was a very nicely decorated facility and the service was great.  A pretty expansive menu for this type of place.  A variety of burgers, salads, and other types of sandwiches.  A lot of sides are offered as well.  They bring the food to your table and have real utensils.  The downside of this place was the food was meh.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great.  But what I paid for the food I really can't complain.  I can easily oversee coming here again, but if I'm in a pinch I will go back.",

I had low opinions of the Habit and their hockey puck veggie burger, and I must sadly report the same of Smashburger.  Just a lump of nothing.  I would rather eat a cardboard container from Burger King than eat another Smashburger veggie burger.  Yuck.    As others have said, the customer service is fine, but I can't eat customer service, and as a vegetarian I can't eat the servers, either, although I'm sure even their uniforms taste better than the veg burger.  God, I really hated that burger, didn't I?  This is another one of these places where I will simply never go again because it was just so bad and bland.    Here's a tip to all restauranteurs: don't put a veggie burger on the menu if you really don't give a shit about veggie burgers or if you simply plan to buy a giant box of a thousand Boca burgers at Costco.  I love Boca burgers in a pinch, at home, and only if slathered in my own BBQ sauce, but not in your damn restaurant.    The only good part about this experience was that they have plenty of parking, and oh, the people who work there are very friendly.  Other than that, yuck.",

    "text": "On our Friday lunch tradition, coworkers convinced me to come to this place. I wasn't too crazy about it being a chain and all but gave it a shot anyway.   Upon entrance, it looks like Chipotle added more red and now serves burgers. After one look at the menu and remembering the Rito's 3pm lull the week before, I decided on the wedge salad but my coworkers all got burgers.   The place was crowded but we easily found seating on the patio. The wait was kinda long but then a few workers were walking around apologizing to people about the wait explaining that the food inspector was in, so they were being extra careful. Hmmm..shouldn't they just be conducting business as usual, like in a regular and safe manner as \"always\"? Regardless, I actually appreciated that they thought to be a little proactive.   The wedge was huge, the iceberg and bleu cheese fresh and the bacon crispy. After watching the grease spots quickly accumulate on their basket liners, I was so grateful for not ordering the burger.   We ordered veggie frites for the table and these were just gross- 10-12 pieces of oily \"flash fried\" asparagus and carrots with a side of ranch for $3. No thanks.   The only complaint I heard from my fellow diners was that they didn't ask what temp you wanted it cooked, but it seems like maybe hers was just overlooked.   Next time I'm in the mood for a burger, I doubt I'd return here, I'd much rather spend the same amount of money (probably less) for the cheeseburger @ Phoenix City Grille.",

I noticed Smashburger on the way to the Museum because their logo is VERY similar to the GameStop logo and color.  Anyway, my boyfriend was the one who suggested this place and their Smash Fries.  We walked into this place, and it seemed pretty decent.  Place was clean,it smelled good, the people taking down orders were attentive and bubbly..  It was cool.  I think the older folks got the Classic Smash Burger, and my boyfriend and I got the California Smash Burger... which had Avocado and the rest of the veggie fixings.  Instead of the regular meat patty, I ordered it with grilled chicken, added jalepenos (I love heat!), and habenero (which is really pepperjack....) cheese.  We took the food home, it was still warm to eat.  The flavor was good, the burgers had a good size.  The burgers when we got it to go were in their individual bags and tagged which one was which.  The individual bags also came with a cute little ketchup packet and napkins, lol.  I completely forgot to order Smash Fries, but my step mom-in-law did and I took a few pieces from her.  If I find this place somewhere in California I wouldn't mind eating from this place again.  Flavor was good, but it doesn't compare to In & Out Burger :)",

The guy working the register was friendly, and when I was 77 cents short he covered it for me, thus saving me a trip back to the car and another hit on my debit card. The girl who brought us our food was also very hospitable, getting me several condiments for my fries, and even suggesting I try their chipotle sauce (which I did, and it was decent). She also offered to get me a to-go cup for my drink when she noticed we were finished with our meals. It's rare, especially these days, to feel like the employees actually enjoy their jobs and take pride in making sure that the customer has a good experience.   As for the food, I got a 1/2lb BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, and it was pretty damn good. Reminded me of a Fuddrucker's burger moreso than, say, In'n'Out or Five Guys, definitely a little different than the norm when it comes to burger joints. I had the Smash Fries, which I thought were delicious with the seasoning they used.  If you are looking for a burger but you're sick of the norm, give Smashburger a try, you might just be pleasantly surprised as I was.",

Chipotle gets just as busy and I am in and out in 10 - 15 minutes flat. At Smashburger it took me 40 minutes to get my salad. 40 minutes!? Then on top of that, the lady gave me the incorrect order. I got all the way to my car and thankfully had the inkling to look before driving away. I came back and they gave me the correct order, but didn't apologize. And the woman said, \"I tried to catch you before you left. I'm glad you came back.\" Umm how hard did you try exactly? You must've whispered my name.  I won't stop going here because of that, I'll just never ever go during lunch again. I suggest you take a note from Chipotle, maybe change up how you take or give the orders, because 40 minutes for a salad is absurd.",

I am a vegetarian, but my partner isn't, and she loves hamburgers, so I figured this would be a perfect way to show my love.  We didn't have to wait long for a booth, but ended up with one by the door that was absolutely FREEZING. We both had jackets on and were still shivering.  We went up in the line to order; she got an all american burger and smashfries.  I planned to get Smashfries, a side salad w/ no onions and a cactus vanilla shake. My friend had the veggie frites, and said they were awful, so I decided not to go that directions.  Apparently, the salads are pre made, and there is no way to get them without onions. I asked if maybe they were whole onions I could just take off. No, they were chopped.  Ok. Since they don't have ANY other veggie options (no veggie burger, no grilled cheese, no vegetarian full sized salad), I asked the cashier what she recommended for a vegetarian.  She told me this was not place for a vegetarian.  Was I offended? Yes.  While *I* am a vegetarian, my partner is not. We like to go to dinner together, and they've now lost both of our business.  Finally, I wound up spending 5 minutes negotiating with her to try and have an arizona cobb salad made without chicken, bacon, onions or jalapenos. She finally figured it out, and we went to go wait.  The wait was maybe 10 minutes, and then out came out food. The vanilla cactus shake tasted like a regular vanilla shake; nothing special.  The Smashfries were actually pretty good; I liked their seasoning...but Delux's sweet potato fries beat them any day.  And my salad? HA.  It was a GIANT bowl only half filled...with chopped iceburg, a hint of cheese, a few pieces of tomatoes, and less than a teaspoon of guacamole. I wish I had taken a picture, it was that ridiculous.  Plus, there were brown pieces of lettuce and the bases (the bottom of the lettuce that is hard and dirty) mixed in there. Sigh. And yes, even without any meat, it cost $6.99  I asked my partner about her burger.  She said it was \"ok.\"  I asked her to compare it.  She said it was worse than Red Robin, worse than Chili's, on par with Sonic and slightly better than Burger King. Ouch. That's a lot of money to pay for a burger on par with Sonic.  She did finish the burger, but didn't like the fries.  Will we be back? No.  The food is over price for a mediocre meal, and they have made it very clear that \"my kind\" (vegetarians) and their friends/partners are not welcome.",

I highly doubt I will come back here again.  This is definitely not the same quality as when it first opened.  They either need to bring back the staff that started this location or do some major quality control.  Trust me when I say the product has degraded in a major way since opening.  If I wanted food that tastes like wendys I would go to wendys and pay wendys prices.",

    "text": "Sure Smashburger is a \"chain burger place\" but that doesn't necessarily mean they act nor serve food that taste like any ordinary burger chain restaurant...  They are much better than many other fast food places and well worth the few extra bucks you'll pay for a good burger and fries.  We tried their Arizona Smashburger with fried pickles. The burger was cooked to perfection, just the right amount of seasoning and temperature!  It came with fresh guac, jalepenos, chipotle mayo, other veggies with Habanero cheese served on a chiptole bun.  It was fantastic! The fried pickles were also a nice change to fries. Crispy with lite batter and some ranch dressing for dipping.  You've got to try these!  We also had the Classic Smashburger with their Smashfries. Again the burger was cooked exceptionally well with just the right balance of seasoning and temp.  Their Smashfries are fries tossed with olive oil, salt, garlic and rosemary. The seasoning was spot on! We've ate fries that are very similar at Diablo Burger in Flag, but the fries at Smashburger are better balanced with rosemary/garlic and salt.  Recommendation: order a create your own 1/3 lb Smashburger with which ever bun, but ask for them to toast it ~ they will! Then add an extra 1/3 lb patty and request them to cook it the temp you want it ~ they will. Choose the cheese of your choice with either smashsauce or chipotle mayo and then get all the veggies including jalapenos. Your total will be $6.99 for a 2/3 lb burger of deliciousness that will leave you planning your next trip to Smashburger!  Don't forget to try their fried pickles and down everything with a cold bottle of beer.",

I've found going later in the evening and you get better stuff all the way around.  They've changed the menu a bit so it seems more expensive. I think you used to get a break if you added a side to an entree......and now everything is ala carte....but the salads with grilled chicken are delightful and the smashfries are yummy.  The Hagen Dazs shakes are super rich and NOT something I get often but are worth it every now and then.  I ask for the Honey Mustard Chicken salad (off menu but they'll still make it) and I like that they offer the salad alone or add protein for a few more bucks.  Seems more fair to the vegan/vegetarian crowd as opposed to omitting protein which you are paying for!",

So I order the BBQ, Bacon & Chedder, and a order of Smash Fries (French Fries with oil and some seasoning)  I go and get my drink and sit down and the order is brought to my table.  Burger was cooked to the way I asked for the and the fries were awesome.  The burger was very tasty and not dry (People who kvetch about grease, HELLO a burger is supposed to be greasy, this is not a heath food choice!!! and to the reviewer complaining about her Veggie Burger, really? why are you getting something that looks like a burger? Go have a salad.)  The food was served quite quickly and seating was not a issue, I want to go back to this place soon.",

Not only is the location close to CenPho but it fills in a space that is in need of decent food.    The new Smashburger is on the side of the Best Buy next to the Cold Stone.  They have some outdoor seating and big windows so that you can see in and see what is going on.    The place is nicely laid out and there are a decent number of tables (more than the Tempe location).  The staff is friendly and helpful.  As far as the food goes - well, it is Smashburger.  You can expect to get yourself a salty burger, some slightly greasy fries, and a yummy HaagenDaz shake.  If those are up your alley, then you will love this place.  In my opinion, they make the best fast food burger around.  If you haven't gotten out to the Tempe location or the new Avondale one yet, go hit this one up.  Im sure it will be packed come lunch time.",

I enjoyed the spice but definitely could have used some hot sauce too. The hamburger reminds me of a good backyard bbq. The fries, eh- I could prob do without. However, I did get to taste some of my friend's onion rings (well, they aren't really rings, more like thinly sliced onions, battered and deep fried) and they were awesome. I would prob get that next time.  Not too long of a wait during lunch so definitely adding this place to the usual lunch mix.",
