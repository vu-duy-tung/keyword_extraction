This is some of the best Mexican food in a rather wide radius. It's not typical when compared with a lot of the fake bs Mexican restaurants we have. The only way it can be consTrued as typical is that it's real. If you want something beyond that (which would completely ruin it) then this isn't your place. If you want the good stuff at good prices, don't miss this place.",

The menu was clear and seemed to have a good selection so I got the veggi burrito and my friend got the fish tacos (baja). The prices were good so we were pleased until we got our food, chips are not included not a big deal so we went back up and waited in line to buy some.   The salsa if that is what you want to call it was really tomato sauce I think, bland and flavorless and all the tops on every bottle were super dirty so I did not even want to try it but I just opened a bottle up and poured some out to avoid the yuk on top of the spout that had obviously not been cleaned in some time.   My 'veggie' burrito was watered down beans (slightly warmed) with a bunch of wet lettuce inside and a little bit of cheese. My friend's 'baja' tacos were some frozen fish sticks in a couple of taco wraps with some soggy lettuce on top and the baja sauce was actually tartar sauce!   When we tried to explain the problem to the people at the counter they hardly spoke english and did not seem to care so we will not be back.   p.s. they don't seem to clean the soda fountain either it was sticky dirty when we went to get our drinks and I found it quite disgusting. and just so you know we went for an early lunch it was only 11:30am.",

This place is comparable to filbertos and that is not a compliment. The marinated pork was actually pork with some chorizo seasoning on it, terrible. The Carne Asada was typical stale and bland. Is there something with seasoning here that people tend to try and  let the salsa do all the covering up. A good taco needs no salsa, just a little lime, the salsa should add just a little kick but not be the whole taste of the taco. Well, I should not expect too much from a chain, no matter if it is a hispanic chain or an anglo chain like taco bell. I also have to wonder who are reviewing these places also.",

I told her it was impossible as there's 12 thousand in there and asked her to run it again. She literally rolled her eyes at me. No really she rolled her eyes at me like I'm some deadbeat who can't pay for a 6 dollar burro. Of course it went through. No thanks or eye contact again. Come to get my food she walked away without asking me if I needed anything. Had to wait and ask for my soda cup. She pours me a solo cup of water without ice and walks away. Have to wait for her to come back and ask for my cup again. She shoots me the stink eye and says she doesn't remember charging me for a drink. Brings me a small cup when my receipt says MD Soda $1.65. Again she lays out a snarky comment saying nearly under her breath that she hadn't charged me for the soda and now I'm annoyed further from her remarks inferring I'm a scammer and looked right in her eye and said You know what. ..you did charge me.

Upon entering there, the place wasn't very busy, but I assume that most of their business happens after people get off of work since they're open until 12am.  They have many booths for you to sit at, and it's not cramped at all. It's a very open area with a high ceiling and light coming in from all sides from the large windows. Across the way sits Starbucks, so if you want a nice ritzy coffee to accompany your Mexican food, you can head over there for a sweet treat.  I ordered the Cheese Enchilada and Beef Taco combo, it took some time for our orders to come out (aside from us there, there were about two other people there, but they were already eating), after we got our orders, we picked up the red salsa and left.  The food, ehh... it was good, but it reminded me of the other Mexican food joints around here. The Beef Taco is shredded beef, which was good (to me). The cheesy enchilada was cheesy and yummy, but for the price that was paid I expected two enchilada's, not one. The rice was ok, nothing great, I've had my share of Mexican fried rice and haven't found one that I have yet to like (except my fathers). Refried beans were good, but tasted like they came from a can. But like I said before, it tasted like the other restaurants.  I would not mind eating here again, they have a variety of things to eat and try, so maybe next time I will try something else!",

I forced them to stop at Los Favoritos in the morning, before we had gone shopping or stopped to get banh mi for dinner. My dad and I both ordered burritos while my mom, who resists trying new things, turned up her nose and said she did not want a burrito because she was saving her stomach for banh mi. I told her that was fine but she was absolutely not welcome to have any of my burrito because I knew that what happened next was going to happen: she ate half of my dad's burrito, and when I still refused to give her half of mine, she got up to order her own. Then she raved about how delicious and cheap it was the entire drive home. Yup.",

The guacamole was even pretty good - not watery and thin like some places make it.  The tacos were pretty good -- not the best I've had, but not bad.  The Jamaica (hibiscus) iced tea was really, really sweet.  If you are looking for an unsweetened tea, don't get this.  The place was clean, and the staff is friendly.",

To have paintings of the \"sleeping Mexican\" on the window decor and on a large mural in their main dining lobby is offensive, especially in Phoenix with all of the attacks on people of color and anti immigrant laws coming out of the state legislator.

I don't mind onions, but one of the cooks has been packing raw white onions in the California burritos. The red salsa used to taste wonderful, but they changed up the recipe somehow...it now tastes like a hot pepper extract of some kind has been added to tomato paste. It's spicy red water now. A couple of months ago, I almost swallowed a thin spiral metal shaving in the salsa. As friendly as the register staff is, they WILL mess up your order without any remorse whatsoever. Tonight I made a huge mistake and phoned in my order...I know better, because this place gets busy and they usually don't seem to have enough staff to take phone orders. One of my standing rules: I never return food when it's wrong, but I did provide a brief opportunity for them to fix it. Finally, I just ordered on top of the error and paid for all of it.

    "text": "Aweful service. Look, I get that it's a cheap fast food style restaurant. But that shouldn't excuse poor service. I don't expect cheers when I walk in the door, or even a \"hello\" really, but they sometimes flat out ignore you! Once, I went there to pick up a quick dinner for my girlfriend and I. I stood there while the girl working mopped the floor and ignored me. Of course I understood she had a job to do, but when I was younger and had jobs like that, I was always required to at least acknowledge a customer and then usually stop what I was doing to assist that customer. You know? Anyway, aside from their aweful service they constantly got our order wrong or left things out all together. The ONLY reason I kept going there was my girlfriend insisted she didn't know any other place to get decent Mexican food aside from a sit down restaurant. I will say I did like the \"Chili Rojo Burro\" and shredded beef tacos though....",

Both are better than the same product that is offered by other Mexican places in the immediate area.    I like their red and green sauces.  The chips that they serve are perfect for my taste.  Their hours are very convenient for most people, since they open early and close late.  The staff there has always been friendly towards me.  As long as they do their job, that's all I ask for.",

The nice thing about it was that you can order breakfast foods all day and it still tasted good.  Mine came out pretty quick, but my friend's burrito was quite long in arriving. They have some good combination burritos that aren't significantly more expensive like the ones you might try to get at other places. I would visit again to get a second opinion of the place.",

Again something with the sauce and it had a LOT of seeds. (yes I am well aware that chiles have seeds, but I don't want them in every bite!) BUT. I did give this place 3 stars because I really enjoy their bacon breakfast burrito, which includes potatoes as well as their beef taquitos.",

Apparently, word is they are not very good, except for Los Favoritos. I scoffed. My San-Diego-friends-now-residing-in-AZ kept trying to convince me how good it was. I scoffed again. HA! Finally, I decided to go, just to compare. What a snob.  Looks like every other taco shop I've been to, maybe a little cleaner. Carne Asada fries is not on the menu, so you have to ask for it. I opened up that styrofoam box, and it was pretty. No, really. I haven't had carne asada fries that good...ever...so far...  Recommendations: Chicken rolled tacos, quesadilla, pretty much carne asada anything.",

Now that I'm back home, it has become my 3 times a week breakfast spot - yes, I live on the west side and yes I am willing to drive 20 miles for their California burrito. I don't care about gas prices or photo radar.. all I care about is their burritos and green salsa... Its delicious, bursting with flavor, perfect tortillas and a whole lot of authentic Mexican love wrapped inside.  Not only this, but its CLEAN, which is rare for a joint like this and not only that, but the staff are NICE, and speak excellent English, which I dig because my Spanish absolutely blows.. They're always smiling and they even remember what you want.. All I have to do these days is walk in and my burrito is already being prepared. Before I even pay. What is better than that?  If you love potatoes, like myself.. try the California. If you like the usual carne asada.. theirs is excellent...  Actually, if you just enjoy Mexican food in general, eat here.. its real, good non greasy, tasty, orgasmic Mexican food and the Horchata is delish and their enchiladas are spectacular..  God, why must I live so far away??",

The rice and beans, often times overlooked drivel at such an establishment?  Solid.  The carne asada fries, a delicacy not even on the menu (a pile of fries topped with a mound of carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, cheese and pico de gallo...I think I just jizzed in my pants)?  Surprisingly solid.  Not quite Riva's in Tempe-solid, but solid none the less.  The business end of the food, about a day later, normally watery and of the Tijuana-Two Step variety?  Not this time pal.  SOLID. (Ok, that was gross.  I apologize in advance for both making a poop joke and actually waiting this long to deliver the SOLID punchline)  Anyone complaining about bathrooms, garbage cans or service obviously has no idea what  they're doing in a dive burrito joint on Chandler Blvd.  You go, you order, you get your burrito and get the hell out.  If you have to eat there, your luck really sucks because this is the kind of food that is best when ordered to-go.    Do you think the lady behind the counter is there to smile at you?  Will it improve your food?  Would you rather her be all business, take your order, get it done fast and quick and hot out the door, or would you rather have her chit-chat with everyone in line at lunch time in a business area when you've only got 20 minutes left on lunch and Johnny Junkforbrains is up front asking her about her fine horchata-mixing skills?  Yeah.  Me either.  So basically, go get a solid burrito and shut up.",

I just already have my fave taco shops, and plus the bland strip-mall experior just didn't shout \"Eat here\" to me.  But he got to choose where to eat the other night after his National Honor Society induction ceremony, and he chose here.   I gotta say, my kid really is smart. Los Favoritos is definitely a notch above typical fast-food-ish Mexican. On my son's recommendation, I got the \"breakfast\" chorizo burrito (served all day). It was on a tortilla the size of a small planet, and stuffed full of savory & spicy meat, cheese, potato and egg.  My husband ordered carne asada, and Daniel got chili rellenos. They were wonderful!   The service was ify, simply becuase communication was a bit hard with non-English native speakers. But they get an A for effort.  I guess I owe Los Favoritos an apology for judging it on outward appearances alone. I'll certainly be going back!",

In some of the best tortillas I've ever had anywhere. I'd buy the tortillas and eat them warm all by themselves.  For me, Los Favs is a breakfast haunt. They make a killer breakfast burrito with your choice of chorizo, ham, sausage, bacon, or some combination thereof. Add to that scrambled eggs, potatoes, cheddar cheese, and I'm pretty sure butter. It will clog your arteries and shave years off your life, but dammit, it's a hell of a breakfast.  Pro Tip: It's half of Chandler's breakfast haunt, too, so come prepared to stand around for a while in the mornings.  They crank out the burritos in turbo, but they've only got two (usually one) registers and so many employees.  They're also open late if you've got an evening craving for some Mexican.",

If you love guacamole and are a snob about it like me don't get their guacamole. It's some sort of bland, cheap green stuff. And then they throw raw shredded cheese on it... Ugh. Sorry Someburros, I should have listened to my guy and drove over to you instead. Waste of money. Oooh and that's another thing!! A small drink, a taco and chips and guacamole was $12!!!! Rip off.",

If you go I would suggest to avoid going during lunch time (noon) because they seem to get overwhelmed with a ton of students from the local high school.  Also I would avoid going the in the mornings, there is this girl always there in the morning and she is just so rude, like she doesn't want to be there or something. Every time I go I get the same experience from her and see her as she tends to others before me... She's just rude and abrasive for some reason like she is doing you a favor.  The burritos are ok and reasonable price. My biggest issue is the attitude specially for someone like me who buys several times a week sometimes a day because is the easiest thing for me on my way to work. Anyway, don't go in the morning specially if is your first time. You'll get horrible attitude",

The place is decorated sparingly and the tables aren't the cleanliest [high school hangout, remember?], the portions are great for the price you pay.  I usually get the carne asada burrito combo, the California burrito combo, or the shrimp burrito.  You get moist fluffy rice, decent refried beans, and a giant [not Chipotle giant or anything but a good size] burrito for the combo.  I love how they don't pack their burritos with cheap \"filler\" ingredients.  They seriously stuff your burrito with a ton of flavorful meat!

The last few months the service was extremely slow. After taking a break from dining here I was happy to see the last few times that the wait time to make the food has gone way down. Overall this restaurant is great and always a go to for my family.",

We didn't get served because this is not a restaurant but a fastfood place so i can't really rate their service. The cashier that helped us order was friendly even though it was late at night when we went to eat. Meats and chickens were all really nicely cooked, taco shells were crispy, lettuce fresh and the lard rice was on point! Just about the right saltiness and greasiness. We went back home happy with our belly full :) 4 stars because some of the outside seats were taken by bums and inside was too cold",

    "text": "This review is for the brand new Los Favoritos located in Chandler on Alma School and Queen Creek Rds. Their location does not yet have a website listing as the 10 other locations do. I will admit, I am Mexican. I am a wonderful cook but even I like to take a break from cooking once in a while. I have been to many good taco stands and Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  I was SO disappointed in this place.  Sad, because it appeared to have good reviews. I will also admit that my husband (who is a gringo) and I both ordered different versions of Enchilada dinners.  Ok so here's my first complaint.  Unless you ABSOLUTELY ADORE green peppers, do NOT order their chicken enchiladas.  It should really be called a Green Pepper Enchilada with a bit of chicken thrown in.  Not only that, but gigantic chunks of onion.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out that those two ingredients are fillers so that they don't have to use as much meat.  My husband had a chicken enchilada and a cheese enchilada.  Hard to believe, but the cheese enchilada was full of green peppers also! My second complaint was the so called \"guacamole\". It came in a 2 oz container and we were charged $1 for it.  That is ridiculous for two reasons: The small amount we were sold and the fact that it was some kind of fake pureed avocado. Guacamole implies that it should have onion and tomato, chilies, etc. in it..otherwise it is just pureed avocado.  Last but not least, they are very chintzy on the rice and beans. That is probably the cheapest thing for them to make and serve and yet we were lucky to get 2 ounces of each on our to-go containers.  As far as flavor, my husband, who is not Mexican, thought it was pretty bland, so so much for the authentic Mexican flavor.  That said, the price for the 2 Enchilada dinner was pretty low and now we understand why.  We will not be returning to this establishment.",

My favorites so far are the breakfast burritos which are enormous in size and served all day and I also liked the the rolled tacos which come with the delicious rice and beans. I have never had a bad experience ordering from this place. They raised the prices recently but the food is still good for the price. The guac that comes on the rolled tacos is kind of bland but adds to the delicious greasiness. It's also open til 2 am so the late hours were perfect for college students or a late night run for burritos when nothing is open. Definitely a great find!",

You know small talk while my tacos were being made. He asked me if i wanted any hot sauce i said green please and can i get like 8? So then he handed me my bag and i said thanks and left. When i got to work i sat in the break room, opened my bag and there were only 3 green sauces. I was like well crap gonna have to be frugal cause i normally douse green sauce all over my food. I took a couple bites of my beans and rice. I took a couple bites out of my taco. I opened the sauce and poured it on my taco and as i was pouring i stopped abruptly and felt sick to my stomach... their was a hair in my sauce, a thick, black, semi short hair. I was sick and felt disgusted. I felt nauseated and hot. I wrapped it all up and threw it away...   I work 12 hour shifts. I was starving all night. I was sick and starving. I just would like my money back. Please. Thank you.",

I like how the burritos aren't greasy and they're usually packed full of the good stuff. If you like spice, get the shrimp burrito. It never fails to get my nose running.

    "text": "Been here a couple of times for lunch during the week. It isn't bad, but it also isn't anything really exciting or special. Pretty much the same as Filiberto's, in my opinion.   The prices aren't bad for the amount of food you get. But again, the food isn't really something I'd seek out if I wasn't in the area. The carne asada fries are probably my favorite. I do appreciate them using real cheese & loading them with GOOD guacamole, sour cream, the works. But the Los Favoritos Nachos weren't that good. While I do LOVE me some fake, processed nacho cheese... this cheese wasn't that good. It had a funny taste. And the chips definitely tasted stale. Along with the oddly red colored taco meat that also had a funny taste- the saving grace was the pile of jalapenos on top.   My coworkers always seem to stick with the burritos. So I've been told you cannot go wrong, there. The one who got a combo plate said the rice & beans had 0 flavor. But, there is plenty of salsa behind the counter, if you ask! And the interior is very cleanly. It's a decent place to stop in for lunch. But they do not allow refills on fountain drinks. Which I find unappealing when you're already paying separately for a drink (NOT included with meals). For nearly $2, why can't we refill a soda or iced tea?! They even charge for WATER (non-bottled)! So I just wasn't overly impressed paying $9+ for a fountain drink & mediocre nachos. And dining in or to-go is always a hit or miss... sometimes we wonder why they even ask when it always comes out on a tray to dine in. But the wait is never too long, even during the busy lunch hour, it's about 15 minutes or less of a wait. However, dine in orders always seem to come out quicker than take-out. Might be a better idea to order for dining in then ask for a to-go container after the fact if time is of the essence.",

The guy in the sombrero painted on the front glass windows even says \"Try a breakfast burrito!\" at this location.   When we walked in, I gotta admit I was impressed. This is the fanciest looking Los Favoritos I've been in so far. The decor is modern and clean cut, none of that hole in the wall feel. It was also spacious with nice seating unlike others I've been to such as the one in Tempe.   I went with my all time favorite here, the bacon breakfast burrito. Unfortunately, it had all the heft of a Los Favs breakfast burrito but none of the soul. While I appreciate that they put large chunks of bacon in the burrito, the bacon itself was pretty chewy. The potatoes were mushy too so overall there wasn't that great texture difference with crispy bacon and lightly crisp potatoes with gooey cheese and soft scrambled eggs that I love in your typical Los Favs experience.   I also had a bite of the #8, the chorizo breakfast combo. It was also a hefty plate but all I could taste was egg and it didn't seem like there was a lot of chorizo mixed into it.   Sadly, I wasn't too impressed with their breakfast items but I'll go back to see if their regular menu is any better.",

    "text": "Shrimp cocktail Mexican style is one of my favorite indulgences! About a year ago, we came to a different location of Mis Favoritos and I was so thrilled that they had my delight. But this time, at this new were location, my delight was an average half hearted attempt to just get the food out.   Of course I ordered the shrimp cocktail. My partner, who doesn't prefer seafood, had a plate of ground beef and pastor tacos, with a cup of tea. The attitude of the girl behind the counter was not the friendliest. She especially wasn't too happy when I told her the tea tasted off (like old dish soap to be specific but I didn't want to be too specific with her LOL!)  When my cocktail was ready, I had to request limes would usually come with it. Again she didn't seem too happy but she did comply. And we had to go fetch our own salsa bottles with somebody left on their table. The service here another words it does help yourself. And if you happened to be on top of things a shrimp cocktail does usually come with limes and crackers. My partner said their was nothing too special about her tacos either. They were just lacking in flavor and toppings. Again, no limes.   Oh yeah, and it usually comes with more than 10 or 12 shrimp for a large one. I only had 10 so there you go.   Sad to say that I'm not sure that Mis Favoritos will become my favorite from here on out.",

Maybe they think they are doing us a favor so we should thank them?  The cook, who has customer service skills as well, came out because the cashier messed up the order. He was very kind and apologetic. Oh, and he thanked me on the way out. I'll change my rating to a 2 due to the example the cook is setting for the customer facing employees.",

    "text": "Mmmmm....Los Favs....Their breakfast burritos are always on point and so is their Carne Asada which are my personal favorite in the state so far compared to (Fillbertso) Filly bs,and rubias in tempe on mill and southern? i think that's the name of the other spot. Favs always get it right though for the most part. Lately they have been overcooking the french fries but it is still amazing regardless.  Their burritos seem pretty small to me compared to taqueira me casita or whatever on warner and dobson but their california burrito is my quick i don't really know what i want so i'm gonna choose this option. Like i said, i usually get the carne asada fries or the breakfast burrito because you can never go wrong with either selection.        I seriously have been thinking about it all night and i am always more than excited to go every time. I am a typical foodie so excuse the excitement as i text as i am preparing for my day of work and stop for my breakfast burrito along the way ;) I once ordered rolled chicken tacos and it was extremely bland and just meh. I wanted to throw it away after i ate one out of three. But my friend made me pack it up. So not only did i end up wasting my food but i wasted a container. i cannot force down food just because that is definitely not my style to say the least.        Living in Arizona you will find hit or miss places, i have heard a lot of people say this is just as disgusting as Filly B's but i beg to differ. Filly b's is just beyond nasty and my stomach always hurts after eating their overly salty carne asada fries. gross. okay back to Favs. I don't necessarily care for the fact that they charge you extra for sour cream,cheese, etc etc etc in your burrito. I am spoiled from the mexican spot down the street on warner and dobson because they load your burrito in front of your face with two scoops of rice, beans, and 2-4 scoops of meat depending on what meat and if u ask for half and half. and let you add in sour cream cheese and whatever else for free. the burrito looks as though its the size of some buff guys bicep. HONESTLY. Favs burritos are half the size of a regular sized girls forearm for 4 dollars compared to 6. their prices on breakfast burritos and carne asada fries are always in my budget though.  Los Favs Here I Come!!! :D",

The food is better than most of the places around us including the more expensive table service joints. The decor is awful, but that's ok... it's a mom and pop Mexican restaurant. They seem to have new cashiers quite often but they always get my order correct. The side door cannot be opened from the outside so if you sit on the patio you have to walk around to the front and re-enter to get drink refills and toss your garbage. That's a pain in the azz when it's busy. The employees are nice and helpful. Good place!",

However, on my last visit, I waited a bit longer than normal. I went up to the counter, and after being ignored for awhile, I handed the lady my ticket. She did apologize and informed me that they haven't even started it yet. I wasn't willing to wait this time. I was obviously upset and they didn't offer to refund my money, give a discount, put a rush on it, or anything. She just informed me that if I still wanted it, I would have to wait awhile. WTF?!!? They replaced my El Diabla, the entire reason I went there, with a couple other burritos. Again, no offer to make it right. In total, I ended up waiting about 45 min-1hr, and still didn't get what I wanted. I should have just asked for my money back. Customer Service is everything. I'm really disappointed. Even though I like the food, I don't believe I'll ever return.",

Interestingly enough, I think it's bigger if you order it for dinner than for breakfast, but for either it's plenty big!  Muy rico with salsa verde.  I'm embarrassed to say that I've only had a few of other things on the menu (quesadilla and other burritos), but they've all been delish!  For some reason, though, I just get my mouth set on chorizo burrito.  It's seductive. The folks there are very nice and sincere, and they know English well enough, although I think some are working on it.   Tip:  You can order ahead!  Especially helpful if you're going during the lunch rush, when it seems like every kid from Seton H.S. is there.  it's pretty nice to breeze in and pay and grab your stuff when there's a gaggle of folks still waiting for their order to be called.     Tip 2:  If you don't order ahead, you can place your order there and then go across the courtyard to Starbucks to grab a coffee (that probably costs more than what you got at Los Fav's) while you wait for your food, if you're so inclined.  This is a bad habit you might not want to get into.  Believe me!",

Today I ordered my usual and this time it was the best that it has ever been and I order this at lease once a week.  This was a 10 star rated dinner even though I can only give 5 stars.  This had perfect fries as they were not hard so they were kind of soft; it was filled with guacamole and sour cream along with melted shredded cheese and in between that was nacho cheese sauce in the middle and on top. Man this was really good because I have never given a Yelp review but I had to tell everybody about Carne Asada Fry PERFECTION!!!!",

They clearly realized the skipped me and either didn't get my order made or they gave my food to someone else. They finally after 20 mins I get my food. I told the guy that you clearly skipped me and they should at least give me a drink for waiting so long. The guy told me that they called my number already. I said I was right here in the front the whole time waiting to be called. You guys obviously asked me my number. Why would u ask for my number if you realized I was sitting there forever waiting for my number to be called. The guy tried to blame me for their mistake. He also tried to say that the cook messed up the orders. Well man which one is it. Is it my fault or the cook. He didn't own that he made a mistake and a he didn't even apologize. He was even hesitant to give me a drink. Poor customer service. The people around me were even stating that they skipped me. This place has great food but customer service is not so great.",

The quesadilla my daughter had was huge and full of nicely melted cheese.  She loved it but then you really can't go too wrong with a quesadilla.  The place was fairly busy with about 5 tables occupied.  It could have been just a bit cleaner in terms of the floor and tables but it was not bad.  They may have just had a rush and not had the chance to come out and clean.  I'll give them benifit of the doubt on that one.    I will go back and try more items on the menu.  They have specials every day and a fairly vaired menu.  It's located in a strip mall next to Starbucks and just down the way is Angel Sweet for dessert.  Overall it was decent.",

The cheese was not even melted -_- and with it being cold, the sauce everything else was cold as well. Never going back to this location.

What I love about Los Faves is that their burritos are not greasy, and they offer them with either flour or whole wheat tortilla. I'm boring with my order and usually get a sausage burrito, and sometimes a quesadilla. Their quesadilla is made with American cheese and not with queso blanco. On weekend mornings, expect a long wait with orders (around 15-20 minutes) since they get really busy. It's a good place to get a nice warm burrito and do yourself a favor and ask for the salsa verde, it gives the right kick to deliciousness!",
