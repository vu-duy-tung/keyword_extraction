    "text": "I love Asian Food.       That being said Fusion places can be very satisfying due to a range of unique choices. But those choices have to be good.      After shopping at Whole Foods we decided to dine here since it appeared to have a good crowd.      The menu has a wide variety of dishes and is very appealing.      We thought of soup and asked a couple next to us what they had and if they liked it. Their reply was that every soup here is great and theirs was the Hot and Sour soup. They were nice enough to lets us try a spoonful after saving their extra. You get a large bowl for a good price.       To be honest it was the best part of our meal along with the sliced BBQ pork. We didn't get any other soup since my friend wanted shrimp.      We started with the Crab Puffs and BBQ Sliced Pork. The puffs were OK though soggy in the center since they weren't fried long enough. The pork was delicious, tender and moist. And was in a nice sauce.      I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo (The worst I've ever had.) Fair taste but no spice with what looked like pre cooked chicken.      My friend had the Spicy Cinnamon Shrimp. A big waste of money. 5 shrimp in a Cinnamon sauce that had very little spice or heat and the 1 I tried, I would swear was cooked with it shell on. Either that or it had the toughest skin under the shell I've ever eaten. They were cooked with peas and came on this big bed of fried wonton strips. It was not worth the money.       If we do return it will be for the soup and to try the Sweet and Sour Chicken which looked good on the table next to us.",

I asked for chicken with vegetables (not on the menu) and asked for more veggies and less chicken.  They made my dish perfect with lots of nice tender crisp veggies.  Nice place to catch a game as they have 3 tv screens over the bar.  Much healthier than bar food.  Happy hour lasts until 7:00 every evening with half price drinks and appetizers.",

They have a full bar and deserts. Casual dinning and comfortable seating, no booths. Friendly service from the hostess to our server. I will be back and highly recommend Flos to everyone.

Black Pepper chicken was a little better, but overloaded with huge onion chunks and bell peppers about 8-1 ratio Onion and bell pepper to chicken.  Crispy spring rolls were also a dud.  The place was packed, but it was 7pm on a Friday night and it's new to the area.  My wife said the tofu was descent.  Long story short I'd go to Pei Wei or PF Chang's 10 out of 10 times over this place.",

    "text": "This is the newest in the chain of restaurants owned by Flo. This is my preliminary review, as the restaurant has only been open for two days and like all new places it has a few things to work out.  I arrived at 6:30 and was seated immediately. I was offered a libation and ordered a Diet Coke, the only diet drink on the menu. I would have ordered Iced Tea except that the only sweetener available was what many restaurants have removed from their tables in favor of Splenda. Unfortunately, the carbonator on the soft drink line was not working properly and my Diet Coke was mostly syrup and water.  The restaurant was nice looking, but was all hard surfaces making for a somewhat noisy environment. The addition of some soft hangings or some carpet would ameliorate the amount of sound.  First ordered were Spicy Wontons and Chinese Lettuce Cups. The wontons had good texture and I loved the very light wrapper around it. The flavor was very light as was the spice but I would order it again. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the lettuce wraps. My plate contained a half head of lettuce which was not taken apart at all, so my first order of things to do was to tear apart a half head of lettuce. In doing this a number of the leaves broke apart, leaving me with broken leaves to place the contents on and later drip down my hands. The filling did not impress me as it seemed to lack flavor which the accompanying sauces could not make up for.  Next was the Hot and Sour soup. A lovely bowl of properly gelatinous soup swimming with all sorts of goodies including very fresh shrimp. I added some vinegar and chili oil and it tasted just like I remember from China. This soup was dynamite! I'd have loved a bit of Ogo in it but it was a great soup.  Next was Kung Pao Chicken. One of the ingredients in it was zucchini which was a nice surprise since so many places use celery. A second nice surprise happened when I was served both white and brown rice. While white rice is traditional in oriental cookery, the brown rice is a nice addition for those who prefer a healthier option or prefer the nutty taste of it. The chicken was cooked to perfection, but once again the dish seemed to lack in the flavor department. It seemed to be lacking the heat and flavor that should be part of the dish, as well as the peanuts that I could not find.  I was brought Ma Po Tofu to try. It was made with regular peppers, and while the ingredients were all there, none of the heat was. I wish it had been made with real Szechuan peppercorns which would have made it an authentic dish even if it had to cost more.  Last was the Chocolate Wontons. Half wontons cooked till hardened then covered in a dark chocolate sauce plated with a slice of orange and dusted with powdered sugar. I appreciated the interplay of the orange and chocolate, but there was no way to eat it without getting my fingers dipped in chocolate too. Not that that is necessarily bad for a chocolate lover, but getting cleaned up afterward without a wet nap is a problem.  Overall, as a new opening there are a few problems to be ironed out, especially in the flavor area. Most of the food seemed cooked beautifully but lacking all sorts of seasoning. While Flo is noted for healthy variations in her food, she is not known for lack of flavor and I am hoping that this will be worked out by my next visit in a few months. If I had to sum up the food in one word it would be fresh. The food was anything but tired and worn out and the use of nice fresh ingredients was apparent.  The restaurant seemed spotless. The waitstaff was a little confused but that is to be expected in a new opening. The cashier needs to know that sitting on the counter where the register is does not look nice and is unacceptable.  I'm giving 4 stars for quality of ingredients and for service in a new environment. Next time I hope to give 4 stars for flavor as well.   As my readers know, I do not accept free meals, and after paying for my dinner I found that the  charge on my card had been voided and the meal had been comped. In keeping with my precepts, I have donated the cost of the meal to a local charity.",

Previously I had a great experience with a large group of friends one happy hour after work, but fast forward to when I brought my mother here it was a completely different experience.  The food hands down is delish and you can beat 1/2 off any drink and 1/2 appetizers (with exception to a couple that are not included).   The place was actually quite dead when I made my last visit, which struck me odd that our server was so poor at serving us. We actually had about 4-5 different servicers drop by our table since our waiter went M.I.A. on multiple occasions. Come to find out he's outside on his phone and I found him chatting it up with a table that had shown up some time after us. Later I found out there was a co-worker at that table and apparently that gets you priority service.  Anywho - if you're looking for an awesome happy hour with great prices and delicious food check this place out but be prepared it's a hit or miss experience with the service.",

    "text": "Flo's has done an amazing job of remodeling an old McDonalds. The former McDonalds' drive-thru is now outdoor seating and the inside has been redone in a \"yuppie-wannabe\" sleek, modern look. It was 12:30pm on a cold, rainy day and the place was not even half full.   I was seated right away and my server brought me some water and took my order promptly. I requested some hot green tea since it was a cold day. Beverages are not listed on the menu, so I have no idea what this costs. I never did find out since they never brought my tea. My server stopped back as I finished my meal and I told him to cancel the tea since I was done eating.  I ordered the Lemon Chicken ($9 for lunch) with brown rice. This was supposed to be a special recipe of the chef. Unfortunately, there was no detectable lemon flavor--in fact no flavor at all. Surprisingly, this was the most bland Asian food I have ever encountered. It was so bland that I could not even eat half of the food on the plate (and this was a smaller portion size than most Asian restaurants serve). The chicken was odd in that it was in small flat squares--sort of like the frozen meat chunks you encounter at YC's Mongolian Grill.  I was also brought a small salad with some kind of ginger-peanut sauce on it. It was OK, nothing special. It was also a surprise since there is nothing on the menu about salads being included with my meal. The obligatory fortune cookie shows up with the bill.  The restaurant is clean and the staff efficient (except for the hot tea fiasco). Parking has always been difficult in this particular shopping center. I probably would not go out of my way to eat here again.",

    "text": "I really enjoy the menu and all the wonderful options and tastes.   For example, by offering (and mentioning it in the menu) the flexibility to substitute tofu in any dish, it opens up endless possibilities not offered in most other Asian restaurants.    The last few times I have subbed in the rather unhealthy yet tasty fried tofu in the pan fried noodle and beef and broccoli dishes.   As a bonus, they even reduce the price when  replacing meat with tofu.     Here's where Flo's needs improvement.   First, the service has been very very slow the last few times I've been there.  I don't know  what the holdup is as there appears to be plenty of staff present.   Perhaps the staff needs additional training.  Second, the food has come out warm, not hot.   Could be the slow staff leaves food sitting under the warmers getting cold.     Overall a great place and worth checking out if you're in the area.",

The only negative aspect was that we were apparently seated right under an air conditioning vent because it was FREEZING! I overheard the table that was later seated beside us complain to the server that it was too cold, but there wasn't really anything they could or would do about it.

We started off w/two glasses of wine and the vegetable potstickers, they were about the best I've had and the dipping sauce was delicious. I ordered the Spicy Cinnamon Shrimp, it was beyond  excellent, very rich  and completely different than any dish I have ever eaten, this alone will keep me coming back to Flo's! The fried strips of crepe were a nice added touch to the dish and yummy. i needed a box to take the leftovers home. My dinner companion had the Pine nut Shrimp and said it was a bit bland but the broccoli was cooked to perfection. The portions are nice, not overly 'loaded' w/food, the prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is comfortable and clean. Only one reason I did not give Flo's 5 stars, we were seated on the southwest side of the restaurant, the sun was going down and I had a choice of the sun in my eyes or beating down on my back, my eyes won that decision but our waiter had to wear sunglasses to serve us, there are no blinds to close. I cannot imagine the summer months with the AZ sun interfering with my dining experience, Flo, call your decorator!",

It had shredded carrots and NO walnuts (menu description says walnuts). The chicken is just OK. Honestly, this is a McDonald's quality salad for $9.50. I also ordered the edamame appetizer and the pods are slick with oil. Yuck! I am extremely disappointed, will not be returning to Flo's. Bummer, since the menu sounds so good- but obviously is not.",

    "text": "It's always fun to see new restaurants come up in the area & an Asian Fusion restaurant is definitely right up my alley. We had some evening plans so we just got a couple of dishes to go from Flo's.  The first thing we noticed when we walked in was that the interior is very modern & sleek-looking. There's quite a bit of sit-down seating as well as a few seats at the bar.  After a look over the menu, I wanted to try something different but ended up ordering the Kung Pao chicken with white rice and my date got the Singapore BBQ Pork Noodles.  The Kung Pao chicken was fine but I found myself wishing there was a little bit more flavor & spice. Also, the veggies that were tossed in with the chicken were different than what you usually find in this dish. It all tasted just okay. The Singapore BBQ Pork Noodles were definitely different and interesting. I didn't get too many bites but I thought the ones I did seemed mostly bland. Typically noodle dishes aren't served with rice but this one was.  I thought that the price was not justified. The dishes were both much more expensive than I was expecting in the first place, and then after eating what was served, I didn't find it was worth it. My date did not eat any of the rice so I think it would've been better to have an option of not getting rice and paying a little bit less for that entree. Overall, I don't feel like I have much of a reason to return.",

Really tasty and very hot! (Temp not spicy)The sauces were very good. There was a hot sauce with a texture of salsa but the taste of Thai hot sauces. Excellent sauces.  Then I thought I would try the tom yum soup. The bowl was large enough for 3 and filled to the brim.  The fresh mushrooms were very good, the shrimp a bit boiled.   Would have liked to try an entree but too full. Ordered chicken fried rice - to go!! Great, attentive service. The server was a bit snooty with an air of wanting to be elsewhere. But the rest of the staff was excellent.  Putting it on my places to try again",

    "text": "I met up with a friend for an after work dinner outing. I was looking forward to a calorie conscious meal as I'd researched their menu online a few days before. That's not what I got.  The service was good. I was politely greeted seated quickly. While I waited for my friend and water and the menus were promptly delivered. Our table was right in front of the door and I contemplated asking for a new table but realized it was the only table for two in sight. Yes, I could have asked, but whatever. It was a table.   For dinner I asked for the teriyaki chicken skewers and a side salad with the ginger dressing on the side as I like to control the amount of dressing that I have. The salad arrived first, but dressing was NOT on the side. I looked around for our waiter but he was no where in sight. Oh dang it...I'll just eat it as is.  The dressing was pretty yummy and the salad was fresh.   Then came our meal (which were on the appetizer menu) and I knew that the chicken was not grilled but fried. Oh cr*p. I didn't ask how it was prepared. My bad. It was a pretty hefty portion with about 6 skewers. Not bad.  Then I took a bite and wow...not what I expected at all. The chicken was \"bouncy\" and not tender and juicy. It was fried (or broiled) I think and pretty oily. The teriyaki sauce was very, very salty and I knew my rings would be tight the next day. (I was right.)     On the other hand, my friend's dish looked amazing! She had the lettuce wraps and they looked super fresh.  She said it was yummy and practically ate the whole thing. Again, the portion was sizable.   As another Yelper mentioned, It was pretty loud and at times I couldn't hear what my friend was saying. The noise was distracting.   Since I was looking OUT of the restaurant toward the door, I didn't really take in the interior decor so can't comment there.    I'm not sure I'll be back. I was not wow'ed and to me Chicken Teriyaki is super simple to make. I could probably do better at home. ;)",

My mother and I both said, \"Wow, this fried rice is amazing!\" I would highly recommend for anyone needing an option to select. We both needed To Go boxes to bring the rest of our food home!

While some of the servers are quite young and clearly learning the ropes (we all learn somewhere, sometime), the service was excellent and the food was great. It is shocking that this place was a McDonalds for many, many years, you'd never know it,...and I know it! They did a fantastic job remodeling and rebuilding to make it very open, lively, warm, welcoming and a fun atmosphere.  The food was excellent!  All the ingredients were clearly fresh and each plate made to order. Spices were alive and spot on. Drinks were excellent! We went during happy hour and the value was incredible!! We had 4 or 5 appetizers, where were all good size and 2 drinks and the bill was less than $30,...and we were both stuffed and very, very satisfied! The manager stopped by to say hi and he was a super friendly, knowledgeable, caring guy, that was great.  This is seriously one of the best restaurants in the area. We only had appetizers and drinks but the entrees on the other tables looked delicious and huge and steamy hot!! I can't wait to go back and try them. If they are as good as the apps and drinks we had, I may need to \"up\" my review to even higher.  Really, stop in and try this hidden little gem, you won't be sorry!!!",

Super sweet and basic. We also ordered the spring rolls. Completely ordinary.    Meals. Eggplant/pork dish. I thought I was going to wear it home. The waiter literally almost sloshed it off The plate and in my lap. I just ended up with a gelatinous spill on the table.  It was so sweet it was almost inedible. Yellow curry was actually edible. Pho was probably the best option but not near as good as my favorite pho joint.   $50 but not my last meal. Bummed. Was hoping it might have promise for my new watering hole.",

    "text": "I really like Flo's. I always try to hit the one in North Scottsdale when I'm in the area so I was ecstatic that they opened a location in Tempe.   The whole family went tonight. The restaurant is spacious and beautifully appointed and the food was very good, as always. But the service was appalling.  My husband and I took separate cars so I arrived before him with two of our children. When we walked in, we were told they didn't have a table. Just like that, \"We don't have a table right now\". No offer to put me on the waiting list, nothing. I had to prompt the guy as to what happened next. He said to take a seat, they were cleaning a table. Then, a girl followed up and told me it would be 10 minutes because they were clearing a table.   We got seated in fairly short order though, so that was OK. Our server took awhile to come over. Now, understandably, my husband and other daughter weren't there yet, so I didn't get too fussed. He took our drink orders and said he'd stop back to get our order when our party arrived. My husband and daughter got there and sat down.  The waiter walked by us about 5 times and didn't even acknowledge that he saw the rest of our party. He then came over, plunked my drink on the table and walked away again, without asking my husband and daughter if they wanted a drink. Then he proceeded to walk past us about 5 more times.  He finally came over to take our order. He didn't listen to my husband and put in the wrong order.  Our food came out very quickly but we had to send my husband's back.   So, the short version is, food was good, service was bad. I'm sure I'll be back but this was disappointing.",

    "text": "My family in Arizona recently discovered this place through word-of-mouth, and when I arrived to visit them we went here to eat lunch after they picked me up at the airport. My brother and I split a giant bowl of pho (my mother, the vegetarian, passed because it had a meat broth). The pho was wonderful and came with a plate of add-ins and sauces, plus smaller bowls for us to ladle our individual portion into.  We also ordered entrees which were good, solid versions of Asian food.  My mother, the vegetarian who also wants gluten-free food, was a little disappointed because her entree came with noodles, which she was not expecting and was unwilling to eat. That having been said, she didn't ask the server about gluten-free options before ordering, and there may have been some. If you are averse to eating gluten, you might want to ask before ordering.  Flo's wasn't crowded at 1 pm when we were there, but I'm told it does get crowded at other times.  It was a great place for me to eat and enjoy the sunshine and appreciate being on the ground again, and I hope to go back!",

We all shared several different appetizers and dishes and the food was full of flavor and fresh!! We might of found a new favorite Asian restaurant.   The establishment was clean and sleek looking. It wasn't too hectic busy, but it was not dead either for a Sunday evening.   The service was great as well. Our server was personable and very helpful.   The prices were lower compared to other Asian establishments I have visited in the past.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a different place to eat at.",

    "text": "Have you heard the NPR episode where the seafood industry has a problem mislabeling the species of seafood sold and served? The story goes on to discuss an urban myth that pig bungholes are repurposed and sold as calamari strips. I want to tell you; it's not an urban myth. I had them yesterday at Flo's new restaurant in Tempe. Flo's calamari appetizer was as chewy, inelastic, and muscular as you might imagine a pig's bunghole to be. Even my dog, who likes a nice chewy rawhide occasionally, only ate one and left the remainder in her bowl. I avoided the garbage disposal for fear the motor would burn up trying to macerate the tough over-processed protein.  The entree we shared was the chicken fried rice. It was nothing special. We also shared a 16 oz. bottle of Tsing Tao Beer, my favorite, but we wondered when we paid the $33.00 tab if we'll ever be back. And it's a shame, Flo's location is very convenient to where we live.  I have to add, our server Bethany, was charming and attentive to our requests. For Bethany, we give the extra star otherwise Flo's only deserves one star.",

    "text": "I've gotten advertisements in my mail for this place and was curious about trying. I don't think I will ever go again. There was hardly anyone there when we went inside at lunchtime. The manager seemed nonchalant about us when we walked in. At least he wasn't ignoring us but the overall sterile atmosphere contributed to my overall not-super feeling about the restaurant. Our waiter, although he was very nice, could have been a newbie and when asked of different dishes didn't really give too much detail that gave indication of the dish. Granted he probably didn't know enough about Asian cuisine to comment but it would help in the future. The less than mediocre appetizer of 4 potstickers (too doughy and not browned enough) for $7.50 gave us a clue to what was to come for our main dishes. In my mind I gave them the benefit of the doubt that it's hard to find good potstickers anywhere. But our main dishes were around the same identity...less than mediocre with flavors of inauthenticity that one would appreciate if they shopped at the Fry's \"Asian\" section. The garlic eggplant that I ordered was hardly seasoned while the other dishes that the others got were too Salty or lacked sauce where it needed (ie in the Curry) to soak up the rice.   The waiter was trying to be nice and ask us if we wanted anything from the appetizer list to rectify our doughy potstickers. We declined. Ok so I thought he was done being new and trying to help the situation but later he came way too fast to ask about the check and made us feel rushed (not good). The manager came over as well to ask about our food and while I think he sensed our disappointment he didn't inquire further which in a restaurant like this where there were hardly any people dining and servers galore, there should be time for them to come and really learn about a diner's experience. That never happened. Hmm well I'm getting tired of writing negative things so will wrap it up.   If you are interested in going to a higher end Panda Express or Pei Wei than this is your place by don't expect to get authentic and tasty food for the price you pay. I understand it's hard to get good \"Asian fusion\" or even figure out what Asian fusion food is but Flo's please don't call it that because of dishes like \"Pad Thai\" and \"Vindaloo\" that you have on the menu. Call it that when you have unique Asian inspired dishes and people who care about your experience.",

Their staff has changed, though still a few familiar faces still remain (by a thread I assume). This place has lost its value. The bartenders are seriously not the greatest and their ppl skills could use some more fine tuning. They have increased their pho which used to be $11 to now $16. Mind you nothing changed in the pho, you don't get anything extra, just less. What used to cost us $30 (sake bomb, 2 appetizers and a soup, plus tip) now costs us $60!!!!! Their management has changed and definitely not the same. It's just sad because used to be our favorite spot and would come here at least 2 to 3 times a week and now I just dislike coming here and have been coming less and less.

And not GOOD Americanized-style Chinese food (think Panda Express - greasy and yummy, Americanized) but rather... just... very bland \"Chinese\" food.  The venue itself is super clean and nice, and the servers are lovely people.  Go here if you are too nervous to try authentic Chinese food but want to feel multicultural for a day. Don't worry, they won't give you chopsticks unless you ask.",

LOL!  OH, they have a great HH menu for drinks and food.  The service was OK.  We needed to keep flagging down our server for refills, additional orders, etc.  Since I was only stopping for the ornament exchange, I ordered the Singapore Chicken Satay and Chicken Pot Stickers.   I got my satay and never got my chicken pot stickers.  Had to grab the servers attention to make sure the chicken pot stickers were removed from my check.  TOO bad the chicken satay was very good, and I left hungry!",

    "text": "I've been to the other Flo's restaurants in Scottsdale and I have always had a great dining experience so I was happy to discover a Flo's on the south side of town. Since it was part of the other restaurants, I expected the same level of quality service and food at this location but was really surprised.  Oh gosh, the experience was way off...  REVIEW OF SERVICE:  The waiter must have been new because his explanation of some of the dishes wasn't really helpful.  Additionally, we were in mid-bite when he came over, said it looked like we were wrapping up, and asked if we wanted the check. what.the.fuck. The restaurant was only 15% full, you need to make room for imaginary customers?  Also, usually at Flo's the salad comes out really quick but for some reason today, the salad took quite a while and it was thrown onto the plate so half-assed, it was spilling onto the table when they served it.   Also when the food was delivered, the waitress practically whispered the name of the dish while trying to move it to the table. We had to ask her what dish it was so we could direct her on where to put it.   The restaurant had a lot of employees but the quality of the service was just lacking. Sad really because I brought two friends who hadn't ever been to a Flo's and I'm not sure if they'll try any of the other locations after having such a bad experience.   REVIEW OF THE FOOD:   The pot stickers were steamed and fried like they were supposed to be but they were pretty doughy and the sauce they gave us was really shallow so we had to move the dumpling around in the sauce dish to get some flavor on the dumpling...  Imagine trying to take a bath in 4 inches of water in your tub-  yeah, it was like that.   The eggplant dish was poorly cooked.  One bite into the eggplant and the whole veggie would explode with water. The water completely diluted the flavor which made it feel like we were eating a sponge.  The curry chicken was decent but didn't have much sauce which is funny because to cook that dish, one would need quite a bit of sauce because the chicken, green beans and basil leaves were all evenly coated with sauce but the presentation of it was like a semi-dry curry dish.  Hardly any sauce at all.  SUMMARY:  I can't come back to this location. The other locations are great but this one just seemed like a waste of money.",

The lettuce cups came with a LOT of chicken.  I think it was enough for about 4 people to share that appetizer.  My friend got the spicy wontons, shrimp skewers, and vegetable dumplings.  I tried those and they were also good!  But the spicy wontons weren't noticeably spicy at all.  I like that they take online reservations, even for Saturdays.  I'll definitely be back here again!",

Our bartender Kat, was absolutely a joy and made us feel welcome and like she was happy we chose their establishment. She gave us many tips on the food and drinks and even customized our drinks. She was just so fun and really added to our experience. Then there was the food.  Gotta say this, their happy hour is from 3-7!!!! Which is great for me because I can't make it out on Friday till after 6 which is the time every other happy hour stops. We only had happy hour food which is half price on all the starters. We had lettuce cups/wraps, sliced pork, spring rolls and wontons. We loved them all but the lettuce cups!! Next time we will try some of the entries as they looked delicious! If you are thinking about going here you won't be disappointed!  Also, Kat is such a great asset to this business I'm hoping them appreciate her!",

It was $6.00 at the time, but I've learned that the price has since risen to about $8.00.   This was my second time here and both times were good experiences.   Service: The service was solid. While there was nothing spectacular that happened, sometimes that's a good thing. The waitstaff are consistent with their smiles and politeness. They make you feel welcome even when the restaurant is very crowded. My water and iced tea were filled up constantly.   Food: Flo's is made out to be a fusion-type place, but we chose meals that were pretty standard: a red curry and a chicken stir-fry. I'd say that the quality and authenticity of the food was somewhere between a fast-food place and a home style restaurant. I would eat here again. The Saturday special started with a salad before the actual entree was served.   Ambiance: It's fancier than most Chinese restaurants. You could come here for a business lunch, or just a lunchtime date in shorts and a t-shirt and you wouldn't feel out of place. It's clean too which I really appreciate.   I'd come back here.",

I ordered a shrimp pad thai and it was really bad,  nothing like real pad thai, pretty much egg noodles (large and flat) with a couple of shrimp, bad flavor and again, dried out and old rice.

Had I known what was to come, I would have stopped right there.  Entrees were Fried Honey Beef and Sizzling Rice Soup, both bordered on inedible. The beef was fried to the point of being devoid of any moisture whatsoever. Effectively beef jerky when it reached the table. The soup should be retitled \"wet chicken with stale rice crispies\". No flavor at all. I should have known when the sizzling rice didn't sizzle when dropped in.  This place gets lots of good reviews, so maybe I caught them on a bad day, but this meal wasn't even in the ballpark of decent.  2 stars because the waiters really did try hard. The only way they could have provided better service would have been to warn me and the entrees to come and helped me bail out after the appetizer.",

    "text": "I have eaten at the Flo's in North Scottsdale since I was a kid, so when I saw their sign up in Tempe, I got pretty excited. I told my friend we had to come here for happy hour because they have fantastic deals - half off almost all apps and half off all drinks, yes ALL drinks... awesome! I had the mandarin oriental and my friend had the tytini. Her drink was... odd. It wasn't bad, but it didn't taste like anything I have tried before. My drink was very tasty, sweet, but not overly so, and easy to drink. For 4.50, you can't beat it. We also decided to get 3 apps, which have been very delicious at the other location including the pork potstickers, the spicy/limey Lao lettuce wraps, and the spring rolls. The Lao lettuce wraps were as tasty as I remembered... I like how the chicken has a lot of flavor from the chilies, lime, and spices and it's especially good with some potsticker sauce on top. The other two apps were horrible failures. The potstickers up north are typically fried, these were steamed, which isn't a problem except they tasted... off. Like something about them was bad. They were inedible and we left them behind (which is kind of a big deal if you know me because A. potstickers/dumplings are one of my favorite foods and B. I never leave food behind, either it's eaten or boxed). The spring rolls were greasy and flavorless. I hope the lack of deliciousness was due to the restaurant just opening. Regardless, I would return for happy hour drinks if nothing else.",

I placed a to go order, and it was ready so fast. It was still piping hot when I got home which was fantastic!  We got the Chinese Hot and Spicy Soup-Amazing. It had chicken and Shrimp in it. I would totally get that again. Also got the Beef and Broccoli and the Shrimp Pad Thai noodles. Both came with rice and you could get Brown or White rice. Everything was fantastic. I really like the Pad Thai, the Noodles are different than the Thai version. But, still very good. The ladies restroom was so clean, and that was after the lunch rush. It was large with amble soap, paper towel,and it even smelled nice. I will be visiting this place more often. I just never knew  what I was missing there.

Both dishes were described on the menu as \"spicy,\" but we found them a little bit lacking in heat (though they were otherwise well-prepared and flavorful). Our server was able to remedy the situation by offering us chili sauce on the side to add to our meals. Very speedy service, bordering on rushed, which was somewhat understandable as we arrived about 25 minutes before closing time. On the plus side, at that time of night we had the attention of practically all of the wait staff.    Flo's was recommended by my father who comes here quite often, and I can see why. Generous portions, reasonably priced, efficient and very friendly service - would recommend to anyone looking for good Chinese food in Tempe.",

It is disappointing that over the last couple of menu changes, the food options keeping getting restricted or outright eliminated. For example: skewers & calamari are no longer on the menu at the Tempe location.   The Five Spice Shrimp has been removed from the Happy Hour menu and its ironic that it is listed as a \"Starter / Appetizer\" and this is one of the most expensive items on the entire food menu.   In the last 30 minutes, at least four \"regular\" customers decided to leave and take their business elsewhere due to these eliminations or the TRIPLING in price from certain cocktail prices.   Not the best marketing move to drive away regulars that are a staple of the restaurant earnings.",

Of course it was lunch and no need for lights but the patio was clean and had a modern look. Have to go back some evening and enjoy  the ambiance with the great food.  Back to lunch. It took us a little extra time deciding as it was our first time eating there. I coped out and went easy ordering the Chicken teriyaki and a app of pot stickers. My wife had so curry something.

At lunch, they serve a complementary salad with fancy greens and a tasty dressing.  This location has a wonderful group of servers, that not only provide excellent food service, but are some of the most friendly and happy servers that I have encountered in the valley.

I ordered the Lemon Chicken entree. I had water to drink as they didn't serve alcohol and I am not a huge tea or soda drinker. My friend got the wonton appetizers, he enjoyed them. I refrained (the gluten thing). The chicken dish was good but a bit bland, so I asked the server if they had gluten free soy sauce. He went in back and came back several minutes later with some soy sauce in a regular soy sauce container, and said \"oh I just put it in a regular container because we don't have any GF containers\". My instinct told me not to try it but my tastebuds won out. Within an hour, I was regretting my decision. I was bloated and all the rest of the fun stuff that comes with being \"glutened.\" The next day I contacted the restaurant to give the manager on duty the scoop because I felt that he could use the opportunity to better educate the staff on food restrictions that people face. If a restaurant goes out of their way to state on their menu that certain dishes are gluten free, they need to take that seriously - because people with dietary restrictions have no choice but to take it seriously. Being glutened is no fun. It very well may have been a simple honest mistake or miscommunication between staff so I won't hold it against them. Anyway, I declined the manager's [Devon] very kind offer for a free meal upon a return because that was not the point of my call. Devon took my critique in stride, was very professional and stated he would definitely talk to the staff. I will definitely give them a second chance since the Manager was so understanding.",

    "text": "Sept 2017 edited to add - Unfortunately Flo's menu has had a drastic change. They removed a lot of the options. I was so disappointed to see that the Singapore chicken satay is no longer available. Not sure we'll be back due to the menu change. It's basically Pei Wei now.   Oh wow!  I hope that tonight wasn't a fluke because our first dinner at Flo's was fantastic!  Be sure you take advantage of the happy hour specials, half off appetizers!  We thought about making our entire meal out of appetizers but decided to get one entree as well.   We ordered Chinese lettuce cups, Singapore chicken satay, shu Mai dumplings and black pepper chicken. Everything was delicious!  The portion sizes were generous. My favorites were the Singapore chicken satay and the lettuce cups.  The ingredients were really fresh, the veggies crisp and beautiful...... Couldn't have asked for a better meal.   Lately we've noticed that a lot of the Asian places we have been eating at have overly salty and sometimes goopy sauces. We were so happy to find a place that reminded us that Asian food shouldn't be so salty and sauce heavy. What a nice change!    We definitely could have ordered a couple more appetizers and not ordered the main entree. We will probably go that route next time if we are there for happy hour. I will also order one of the huge bowls of soup that I immediately regretted not ordering when I saw it brought out to a nearby table.  Service was great, restaurant clean and nice environment. We will definitely be going back sooner rather than later. This place is awesome. I might have to go back for the soup this week!",

Soup was good, slightly above average. Shu Mai Dumplings were average, I see the same or better at any Dim Sum. The Dan Dan noodles were completely disappointing and I sent them back after 2 bites. The chicken and sauce were tasty, but the noodles had the flavor and consistency of cheap, overcooked spaghetti noodles from a generic box. Very disappointing.",

I was stunned to see the  \"fried rice\" it was the most disgusting, bland, nothing 'fried' about this dish. Just awful.  The Mongolian beef was ok but more onions than beef. $30 total wasted. NEVER AGAIN, we threw the fried rice out as we could not eat it (was take-out) it was THAT BAD.",

    "text": "About the service: Came in last Monday at lunch time when it was rather busy. Despite the clear rush they were having since there were only two servers as far as I could tell, they handled it with grace. I was immediately greeted upon walking in the door and given water within a minute of taking my seat. My waitress was going from table to table and making sure everyone was okay right before making it to me. She introduced herself and gave me a genuine smile and answered every question I asked. I believe her name was Amanda. Even gave me a great recommendation, pad Thai. When I got a chance to taste my food, she came back by and asked how it was, and I told her it was good however I wish it had more spice, so she quickly left and came back with two different sauces I could add to make it spicier. Both my water and my tea never ran out. Upon leaving I was also offered a kind smile and was thanked for coming in.   About the food: I had a tea to drink and was offered three choices, I chose passion fruit. It was very good, however it is unsweetened, so you may have to add your own sugar. They start you with a salad and the dressing is amazing. I recommend asking for extra on the side because it is just that good. For lunch I got a pad Thai, and even though it was made with noodles I also got a side of rice. The dish says it is spicy, however it is not at all spicy. It does have a nice flavor to it and is made with wider noodles than a pad Thai typically is.   Overall: very satisfied. Will be back.",

I do like the soup but it's $10 dollars because they advertise it as seafood hot and sour but now I'm seeing a pattern. So the last time I got the soup there was two pieces of shrimp in it, and this time there was one. The fact that you up-charge this soup, almost doubling the average cost of Chinese soup by saying it's because it's seafood, is ridiculous!   If you're expecting a normal amount of shrimp in this soup, think again. I will not be ordering this ever again from Flo's.",

    "text": "I expected this to be a decent Asian fusion restaurant with some interesting dishes. However, the food quality is just marginally better than fast food and not at all Asian-style cooking, it tastes like sauce out of a bottle poured onto food..not freshly cooked in any style really. I would say it's comparable to Panda Express, maybe the main difference is just that Flo's is a nice, clean, modern restaurant atmosphere. I bet it's a nice place to have drinks in Happy Hour, but I was there today for food. It's also a lot more expensive than the really fantastic Asian restaurants I've tried in the city so far. I go out to eat for the food, and the atmosphere is a bonus. This place is busy, so I guess that a lot of people care more about atmosphere before the food. I tried four entrees, so that's a fair overview of the restaurant.   A few surprising and clueless things about this restaurant:  1) They serve rice along with their noodle dishes (on the same plate)...lol 2) No chopsticks!! 3) Not a single Asian person eating or working in this restaurant...maybe that's a sign in itself.   There are much better Asian restaurants in this city, we were just hungry and stumbled across this one today.",

I'm not sure if it is under new management or it was just an off night, but I have definitely had better at the other locations.

We tried two happy hour appetizers, the dumplings were the good but the bbq pork was overly soft and warm rather than hot. This was disappointing as it was clearly not made fresh. We ordered two entrees as well, the chicken teriyaki over rice and chicken katsu. The katsu was decent considering it wasn't even called that, it was listed under a bland english name. Points for how thin and crisp it was; however, no katsu sauce? no Japanese condiments at all? No deal. The teriyaki bowl was monotone in flavor and texture; if we could get something crunchy/crispy up in there and add some veggies it could be 80X better. Worst part was bill was $40 for two people; I could eat so well at Chanpen Thai for that.. and not feel like I'm paying dumb money for white asian food sns (I gotta say tho, the full bar is beautiful)",

    "text": "While having a few valley locations, I have to admit that I always feel like this place is local eatery. I'm not a big fan of the chain places however this location has made the list of \"family go to spots\" as they have something that accommodates our family's wide variety of taste.  Flo's sits near the intersection of Rural & Baseline. Lot's of options in the area so it's busy with wandering drivers. We did a pickup previously during the eventing and parking was challenging, but realized they didn't have a designated Takeout Parks up front.   Comfortable atmosphere with a full bar along with multiple televisions just in case you want to check out a game. We ordered the seafood noodle soup, several potstickers which by the way I enjoy the fact that they make chicken potstickers and not just pork.  We also picked up some orange chicken and peking duck and quite a few cocktails to help with the edge of the holidays.  It wasn't a pack night but it was great to have our server and staff very attentive throughout the course of our meal.  All of the food was solidly good and honestly came out tasting as  expected.",

I ordered the Cantonese Style Pork and was disappointed as the dish really had no flavor and was bland.  My sister ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce which was amazing!  As for a food rating I would give 3 stars.  As for overall experience and wait staff rating I would give a 2.  The staff was definitely attentive, however, when bringing a stack of 6  dishes to the table for our party to use, instead of using 2 hands which would have been a better choice, the waiter chose to use 1 hand and placed the stack of dishes on the table with his 1 hand wrapped around the plates and his thumb smack in the middle of the top plate.  First off, probably a health violation, not certain, but definitely would think twice about eating there again.  Second you would think someone who was waiting on tables for a living would know better.  The next thing was twice we were brought a dirty dish and utensils that were not entirely clean.   Really wish I had a better experience as I was looking forward to trying a new place.",

For a former fast food joint stuck with another ol' strip mall they managed to make this place feel inviting yet open and airy.  Okay, on to the food. My boyfriend and I started out our meal with the regular lettuce wraps. They were really good. I could have just eaten these as my meal. We would have liked a little more sauce for them though - mostly because the sauce added so much flavor to it.   For our entrees I went with a chicken and veggies dish - it was a slight variation on the chicken and veggie stir fry and my boyfriend got sweet & sour chicken. The portions were huge - we definitely could have shared. And I liked that they gave us both white and brown rice - perfect for a little mix and match. The ingredients tasted fresh and the dishes were very flavorful. Overall we really enjoyed our meal. And then we enjoyed it the next day as leftovers, too.   We'll definitely be back.",

We just spent $40 on a to go order for lunch and not only did they mess up our order (we think the waitress was new, she didn't know the answers to any questions on the phone), but about 3/4 of our food was nearly inedible... it was just plain gross. Just a waste, we threw it out after a few bites. Suffice to say, I don't think we'll come back again.",

The Edamame was cooked well, but was just salted and needed garlic or something. The Spring Rolls were just ground chicken with really no vegetables or too little to make out. The texture of just ground style meat was not appetizing. The Won Ton was a huge portion and had large won tons with a whole shrimp which was nice, but they were too big for your mouth and too hard to chase in the broth to cut. I tried to just bite one on the spoon, but it was difficult. The iced tea was excellent!  I REALLY wanted to love the food since the staff was so wonderful, but it just wasn't what I expected.",

Well, if modern colors and lines with a contemporary feel is beautiful to you, this is the place. I liked it the minute we walked in the door. We were greeted immediately and taken to our table. Our server, Blaze, was soon at our table taking our drink orders. $2.50 for ice tea is spot on. Very good green tea I would like to say. MT ordered the Shu Mai ($6) to start. Lovely little steamed pork dumpling. Full of tasty puree'd pork with a ramekin of sweet & spicy dipping sauce. A tad salty but overall this was a great start to our lunch. MT ordered the House Pan Fried Noodles ($9). He said his lunch was good. I was impressed that our entree's came with a small house salad. Nothing special but for the price this little add on was perfect. I ordered the Lo Mein ($8.50) subbing in Thin Rice Noodles with a mix of Vegetables and Roasted Pork. The noodles were delish, the veggies were a combo of steamed broccoli, zuchinni, bean sprouts and napa cabbage. The pork was long strips, seasoned fine but a tad overcooked. In addition was a half baseball size pile of brown rice. All in all a very good dish. Lots of Gluten Free items on the menu as well as Spicy and/or Vegetarian choices. Happy days. Great Service, really good food, fair prices (lunch), beautiful space. 4 Stars",

In fact, we went there twice in December!  We tried several dishes, but our favorites so far have been the fried calamari (which has delicious peppers mixed in), the lettuce cups (which have a great kick to them), the egg fried rice with chicken (I rarely like fried rice at restaurant's - this was fabulous) and the pho was pretty good, too!  The pad Thai was really good at a level 5 once I added a ton more red chili paste. I just like it better elsewhere.   They have an amazing happy hour from 3 to 7 daily, which gets you 50% off appetizers and drinks!  I love a good deal. This one will have me coming back time and again.   It is really a cute restaurant, too!  Now you know what to get me as a gift... A Flo's giftcard!",

We should have walked out right when we stepped in and realized that there were no Asian diners. Just a panda express disguised as fancier dine in. Chicken was dry and costs over ten bucks, our \"calamari\" was a joke as well. A couple of the employees were slacking, it was awkward seeing a couple of them flirt and not pay attention to their tables. They obviously don't care about looking and acting professional. Go to panda express and save your money and your taste buds if you want fake Chinese. Also, it's not exactly the fact that it was so far from authentic, because I like and tolerate fake Asian food just as much as the next college student, but this was just overpriced shit. It was one of those rare bad food experiences where you regret even walking in. There is absolutely nothing worse than paying for a horrible meal.",

I like the way it is decorated but I will say that for the prices, I wish the seating was a tad more intimate. It had more of a fast food seating arrangement. It is very clean and nice though. For appetizers, we ordered the crab puffs and the salt & pepper wings. Fyi, the wings take a minimum of 20 mins, our main entree came out first. For our main dish, we ordered the crispy honey beef. This was by far AAAAHMAZING. Awesome flavor. Also got an order of bbq pork fried rice. The rice was just okay. The pork needed more flavor. We also ordered a drink and beer. Before tip, our total was about $69.  For what we ordered, I don't think it was worth that price but it won't keep us from eating there again. Also, it would have been nice to have our food boxed up instead of ourselves having to do it....I would recommend this to others.",

It would also be nice if they put some booths in as the seating isn't the most comfortable. Also seems like they might be understaffed, though I myself am surprised a restaurant is this busy on a Wednesday evening!   I think this place has a lot of potential. They do a very interesting mix of Asian foods including Chinese, Indian, Thai, etc. I really hope they can work out their kinks. Especially the sound..

    "text": "Was in Phoenix on travel, this place was suggested for happy hour.  Well the server didn't know the specials.  Then when we ordered some other person dropped food off at the table with an attitude.  Server had to be flagged down to get assistance.  We called the manager over to tell him about the service.  Glad I don't live there and wont go back if i did.  Maybe service is better at the bar than table service.",

    "text": "I have never had such service that I had to let others know about it.Yesterday was Valentine's Day and so we decided we were going to order take out and have a family night. We choose Flo's  in Tempe because an individual recommend it said he goes there for lunch all the time and  said it's fantastic. I wish I could have received the same service he gets at lunch time. So I call to order take out and the young lady answers and asks if she could put me on a brief hold sure I said knowing it's a busy day of the year so it was a little bit of time that I held probably 3 minutes or so and she comes on I tell her I would like to order take out coconut soup,pot stickers, wings,crab puffs and pepper bacon shrimp she kept correcting me chicken bacon I'm  like no my husband seen it on your menu then she finds it tells me the keys on system are always moving ok whatever 58.00 I seen on the website 50% off most appetizers and drinks ( doesn't say in house) you should probably put which ones are so people can see them. But was in shock I thanked her and hung up  omg I was thinking I text my husband to tell him how much  because he was on his way. He asks WTH did you order I'm thinking regular Chinese food appetizers  and though one might at least be half off. then I called back I asked the woman to remove coconut soup and she  very abruptly say I will and hangs up the phone(rude) so my husband proceeds to get home we sit down to eat and I was shocked this food was like nothing we expected at all the only thing half decent was the crab puffs because they weren't soggy and for 7.50 and only 6 in the bag the wings had a good flavor very scary looking because they put crispy wings on a plastic container that's not a good move and that was 12.95  wasn't a dozen  which I was shocked for that price and ordered the pot stickers they were gummy as if they were not cooked fully and they were pork so didn't want to take a chance getting food poison, my poor husband after working all day gets a container of soggy bacon what looked like Roma tomatoes soggy and it had 4 shrimp in it. Our Valentine's Day was to focus on each other and express the love we have for each other  instead we didn't eat much of this very over priced meal. To top it all off in conversation about how mad at ourselves we were for getting food from there. My husband says you didn't get your coconut soup I said I know I called and cancelled he said they still charged me for it I called and explained to them what happened there was not a sympathetic answer given basically it was 20 questions I was asked was it a man or woman that checked you out? Do you happen to know their name? My favorite one was are you sure you didn't get it? Then she puts me on hold and a man picks up ( please let your customers know that they will be transferred) I said do you know why I'm calling ?he said yes and then told me what I can do is give you store credit we have a book here with the names in it ( I had to chuckle because I understood after what I was served I understood why)or I can void your transaction and I'll need to take your credit card over the phone with the 8.50 plus tax taken off . We chose the void. He says I do see a 10.00 tip should we keep or remove that no keep it I stated it's Valentine's Day so he then tells me what my total is charges the cards I still have not received a sympathetic response even from the manager. I will never eat nor recommend this place and I will be telling my close friend that frequents there today when I get to work. I have been in the service industry for years my recommendations  are: 1. You should never make any customer feel like your to busy to assist or take care of them and not a good idea to the game clue when a customer said they didn't receive something. 2. You should probably reevaluate the container you use for hot food because as cost effective as they may be that alone will loose you business nobody should be subjected to pay high prices for soggy food 3. You should put quantities on your menu so people know what they are getting for that price 4.If the roles where changed I may have \"apologized\" for the level of service along with asked how everything else was and more then likely being it was one of the busiest days of the year would have at least gave 50% off the meal to encourage return business . 5. Know what goes out of your restaurant should always be known for quality not quantity. I would never tell no one to eat at flo's because that is just not me but I wanted to share my service with you as a first time guest. Thank you",

When the waitstaff finally paid attention to us, we were seated, but the service was pathetic. The need for drink refills went unnoticed and it took 30 minutes to get the check. After leaving the restaurant, neither of us felt great from the food and decided the leftovers needed to be trashed. I had such high hopes for this restaurant, but I'll never be back.",

They did correct the Oder but by then the vegi egg rolls were ice cold. The \"experience\" was ruined & most of it is ready for Fri trash day. Expansion without quality control just simply isn't worth it.",

    "text": "I took my parents this this restaurant yesterday. We had been there twice before and found it good so we thought we would go back for a third time. That will be the last time. What could go wrong, actually did.  We were later than usual and was surprised how conversations and general noise carried in this place. We could not hear each other without raising our voices, also asking the speaking person to repeat what they had just said. Very uncomfortable. We ordered one of the lettuce wraps for an appetizer and could not eat them because of the high spice content that I did not see on the menu when I ordered them. That was a waste of money.  We ordered brown rice and ended up with white. Of course it was taken care of when we brought it to the server's attention but come on... Another server attempted to deliver an order to our table that was not ours and we had a hard time convincing her that it was not ours. The gentleman that was responsible for re-setting the tables was walking by and we all noticed that he was holding the clean water glasses in place as he walked with his chin inside the open part of the top glass. Ugh! Let's just say, we didn't drink any more water after we saw that! The server could not remember our order from our table to the ordering station and had to keep coming back for clarification. Service was slow and it took us forever to get our bill and then to have the opportunity to pay it. The actual main dishes were not as good as we had before and we had to once again chase with server down for dinner plates. All we had were the serving platters. Needless to say, the leftovers did not come home with us since they were not up to par the first time around. We were not impressed.",
