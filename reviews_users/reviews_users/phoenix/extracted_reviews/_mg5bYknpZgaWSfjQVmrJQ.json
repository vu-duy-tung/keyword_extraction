    "text": "I love this place! My family and I have been going to this location for the past 3yrs. The food is so good, pasta, pizza and the variety of drinks. The best part is the happy hour menu from 2 to 6 which includes some of their specialty pizzas , meat balls (tasty, huge meatballs) and wings.The price is right for a family of 5. Let's go back to the pizza. Its thin and crispy and oooohh so tasty we usually get 2, Get Meaty and Mama's Spinato's. The Margherita pizza is awesome but not on the happy hour menu, it is a must have.  The service is great, we did have several hiccupes once the waiters said our order was not submitted, we caught it because the table next to us received their food before us and they were seated after we were. They were very apologetic about the situation. On another visit my husband found a piece glass in his beer. The manager did come to our table to apologize without us having to ask for him and then check on us a 2nd time. This impressed us since usually management doesn't get involved until they have to. The restaurant is very clean and well maintained and the food is awesome! This is a must try no matter how far away you are from the different locations. I know I'll be back.",

Two of our family were in their 90's ans when we finally got a table we got beverages and order taken then never saw a waitress until our order came 30 minutes later! I finally went to the kitchen and asked  for bread.  We were in the restaurant over 2 1/2 hours. For a fine dining experience that's one thing but this is a family pizzeria. Open every table! Patio tables were closed and no one was being seated in the banquet room. This was our third visit of the week and the worst. Poor service far outweighed the goos food.",

    "text": "Gotta say this place was pretty dam good. First I had an appetizer of Garlic Bread with cheese. Hands down...the best garlic bread I've ever eatin. From the crunch of the crust, the flavor of the cheese and the marinara sauce...wasn't too tomatoey(word?). It actually had a little sweetness to it.   Also tried a small order of wings with medium sauce. I'm a wimp when it comes to spice/heat...don't judge me...but they were juicy and well cooked. (Not pictured)  Pizza was thin crust. Half pepperoni and the other half was Hawaiian (pineapple w/ ham). Flavored were on point.   Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some good pizza and garlic bread. Not to mention the atmosphere was very chill. Games were on the tube and the people looked good.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed. This was my favorite place to get Chicago pizza, just like back home. I have visited every location Spinato's has to offer. I was never disappointed until this evening. I ordered a Large \"Chicago\" pizza and an order of meatballs for pickup. I was told 30 minutes. I left my home 30 minutes later thinking it will give them an extra 10-15 minutes since I live that far away. I arrived and was greeted kindly, but nothing was ready. I was told it would be another 10 minutes until the food was ready. Meanwhile a young lady walked in and was told the same. We both waited while pizza after pizza kept coming out and put in the warmer. The kid, sorry gentleman behind the counter never once seemed to turn around to see that. I knew my order was one of them. A girl came out to ask me if I wanted to wait for my bread, which surprised me because all I ordered was pizza and meatballs and none of which came with any bread. I told her that I didn't want bread. The order for the young lady then came out and guess what?? They didn't give her the bread that they asked me about. They didn't know who's order was who's? She seemed disappointed when the gentleman behind the counter told her that they asked me if I wanted the bread. Confusing, right? A girl came from the back asking what number my order was, to which I replied, \"268\". She then opened the warmer to pull out my order, which was sitting there another 10 minutes. I came home and the pizza was just completely soggy, not even edible. The meatballs were the size of golf balls with enough sauce to only cover one of them. Ridiculous. This place used to be awesome, now it's just your basic run of the mill pizza joint. I can not believe how far they have fallen. The customer service at pickup is just teenage kids who cannot concentrate enough to figure out the orders. I won't waste my time with this place. I'll stick to other places in the area. Get your act together!",

Another TV was showing  westminister dog show and another the emmy's.  We asked why and James C informed us that it was a \"management request\" without an apology or furher explanation.  We sat in his service area to watch the game.   James C then spent his time watching the TV that he changed.  By the way another TV in the bar had that same show playing that James was watching - it was obvious James didn't want to miss his show! (Spinatos  on 7th St and Missouri).",

The pizza was good and since they dropped some on the way to the table they made us a personal pizza to go to make up for it. Unfortunately when we went to eat the leftovers the next day we discovered they put the wrong toppings on it!   The stuffed mushrooms were not very good. Fortunately we only ordered the half order special. Salad was tasty but the serving bowl was taken away by the busboy before we finished it.  Not likely we will go back again unless someone we know is partial to them.",

About this location.  Really unique and modern.  They have a nice bar and out door setup that's very open and inviting.

They were prompt friendly and make some of the most well balanced and refreshing cocktails. Brody was our bartender and he made me a perfect jalapeno margarita. I don't often leave reviews but between the conversation and great food and drinks I was compelled to let the community know that if you're looking for friendly knowledgeable staff with great drinks and pizza you should stop by !! Thanks Brody me and my friend had a great time! !",

We ordered a side salad each with the main course being the meat pizza. The side salad was a full bowl serving and if you are a light eater it is good to know that. Since I am not a light eater I was happy to see it. The pizza was very good but a little over sauced for my liking. The flavor of pizza from spinatos is always great and has a sweet tang to the sauce. This location is close to where my wife works and gives me another reason to travel down there. We will be back for sure.",

The restaurant is a lot bigger and can accommodate many more people. I went for the first time last night and yet again had a great experience. There was a lot of people so I had about a 20 minute wait. I would recommend calling ahead to make a reservation. Relaxed atmosphere huge bar and patio area. Also this location has it's own take out area so you want be cluttered in the host area like the smaller location.",

Started at 6:10pm, now it's 6:25 and I am on hold on both land line and cell.  Initially the automated system said I was #1 in the queue.  Then someone picked up the line and disconnected. Called back and now I am #5.  Waited and when answered asked for a manager. Janelle spoke to me and was attentive.  Advised her of the situation and she said they had just switched over to new phone system because previously customers would get buzy signal.  Told her 2x's when I had tried back it told me all lines buzy and sent me to voicemail.  After she advised the wait time for the order was 45min. we passed and opted for the competition.  Obviously they have enough customers.",

I didn't say anything because usually places like these do bathroom checks every 45mins-a hour. I went to use the bathroom again over a hour the same stall still did not have any toilet paper. I told the host when we left. Now here we go with the drinks and food. I had the mojitos and they were yummy. We had order a salad and while eating the salad myself and my friend felt a big crunch and noticed there was small pieces of rock in the salad! We told the waiter and showed it to him and he left. We never got an apology and they even charged us for the salad! We found a manager and they comp the rock salad but we were surprised that when we originally showed our waiter the rocks we didn't get a simple apology. Now the pizza was BOMB!! We had the Greek and Six pizza. I would recommend this place for the pizza but not for the salad or slow service.",

The menu was very diverse and the portions were very generous for the cost. We ordered sweet asian and hot wings, cheesy bread, meatball trio, and the small pizza with pizza and sausage. I remember not caring for the sweetness of their red sauce but I really enjoyed the sauce this time. I am super picky about meatballs and really enjoyed these. Can't go wrong with cheesy bread, they are super garlicky so be prepared. Pizza was medium crust with plenty of toppings. We sat at the bar and had awesome service. We will be back for sure!",

I have eaten lots of pies at  lots of pizzerias, and I have  to say that Spinato's Pizzeria is one place that serves up a delicious  pies.  Spinato's is Not just another pizzeria; they have a full menu and a product line with sauces and salad dressings. Today, I was fortunate enough to have tried Spinato's for the first time at a Holiday Party and I can't praise the food enough.    I tend to be picky when it comes to pizza pie and Spinato's doesn't disappoint. The crust on Spinato's pizza pie is thin, and the sauce is perfectly sweet (no acidic taste). The toppings go completely to the edge of the pie and the pizza is cut into squares. These pies are the perfect combination of sauce, toppings, and crust.  In addition to Spinato's delicious pies, Spinato's offers great salads. I really enjoyed the Strawberry Gorgonzola Salad made with fresh baby spinach, strawberries, candied pecans, and gorgonzola.  The ravioli, meatballs, sausage, and chicken Alfredo,  were also delicious.  Spinato's will be added to my list of  favorite pizzerias.",

Waitress was nice, but service was a little slow, several times we waited on drinks, It didn't appear to be overwhelmingly  busy but it is Mother's Day so maybe she had little more tables than she could keep up with. Ordered the super 6 pizza and wings. The pizza was good, love thin crust and yes the pizza is flavorful but a tad sweet. The wings are big and flavorful, we ended up ordering a second order of wings and to our surprise they did not taste the same as the first round so it was inconsistent. We also ordered a brownie with vanilla ice cream and a raspberry sorbet, brownie was warm with gooey chocolate, a chocolate lover will enjoy it. The raspberry sorbet was very light and flavorful, not sure if it's homemade but it did taste like it is. Overall it was decent... wouldn't come out of my way to come here but if I was in the neighborhood I might stop here. Idk wasn't overly impressed.",

We noticed that there was a happy hour for drinks and apps, so we got the cheesy garlic bread and dipping sauce.  Amazing and tasty!  I went with a calzone, which was reasonably priced and small (the waiter warned me), but it was the perfect size and I even brought half home for later.  This was fresh and delicious.  My husband enjoyed his chicken parm and ate every last bite.  We are from NY, so we are usually picky about Italian food, but we really enjoyed our meals.  I don't know if we will have a chance to come back, but I recommend this place.  We ordered 1 beer, 1 appetizer, personal sized calzone and chicken parm, total with tax was $27.

Morgan, the hostess say...oh, sorry. UGH so irritating!! Don't lie to the people on the phone! Not cool!! Had a feeling multiple people were told the same because as we waited, 3 separate parties asked the hostess how much longer and noted they had all passed their estimated wait time. Front desk needs to get it together for sure!  As a positive...food was good and our server was super nice.",

    "text": "Are you looking for a neighborhood pizza joint? Have no fear... the decision is clear! Spinatos is the place to go for great pizza. I order take out here once every two weeks at least.   I usually order a personal size pepperoni pizza with extra sauce. What makes Spinatos unique? It's all in the sauce, they have a very distinct sweet sauce. I haven't had any pizza like it. On lighter nights I will order the entree Caesar Salad. I personally think they should lower the price on the salad for what you get, but I'm not complaining. This time around I got adventurous and ordered the Butternut Squash and Brussel Sprout Penne. I thought it was good and lived up to the name, but it needed a little acid to tie the dish together.   Overall, this place has been my go to pizza spot for 5 years and will continue to be for many years. :0)",

As my family and I arrived we asked for a table to seat 12 since we were unable to make reservations. The wait was not long at all and to our surprise they seated in a separate room from all the commotion.   As we were greeted by our waitress she began to take our orders for drinks. The waitress was very nice and offered suggestions on what happy hour items they had available. We started with the boneless buffalo wings which were great. For our main dish we ordered the get meaty and a couple more orders of the wings and a calzone. Everyone in our party had a great time and the waitress was so nice and attentive.   If you are looking to have a party here make sure someone comes a little early to get a table because they do not take reservations.",

My coworker had the meatball sandwich which he said was delicious. Both came with potato chips which were ok but seemed to be leaning towards the stale side.

From what I remember this was voted the best pizza in town so we decided to give it a try. The location itself is beautiful and the menu has a variety of options to chose from. We got the garlic bread with the marinara which was excellent. We also ordered the combo pizza which was okay, but not anything special. This place sits right between oreganos and Olive Garden in my book. For such a nice building I was surprised to receive a plastic cup and a paper napkin. The place was good but not enough to bring me back.   Our server was nice but never once checked in on us or offered anything else to us. We asked for the box, check and dessert menu and had to request her to put our order in. This place didn't do anything for me but I can say I've tried it.",

My dad ordered the chicken pesto pasta which I was going to order, but changed my mind. I did taste some of it and it wasn't very good. It was very oily and hard to eat. The flavor wasn't very good either. I ordered a thick crust pepperoni pizza which as okay. I felt the sauce was a bit too sweet.   It was okay and nothing more.",

It's a pizza place where you can opt to eat in a somewhat healthy manner! (Or be as cheesy, meaty, carby naughty as you desire!) Two of us went in on a Tuesday night, relatively late for Phoenix dinner (I think we met around 8ish). The place was packed - and we were lucky to get a table in the bar with no wait. There's a drink special each day - Tuesday was cheap premium beer. The service was friendly and on point, food was delivered quickly - fresh and hot for the pizza, fresh and cold for the salad. The visit was definitely worthy of a four star review - and I know lots of people swear by the pizza - but it just wasn't stellar for me. Good, but not amazing. However - based on the comfort and cleanliness of the place, friendliness and competency of all the staff I encountered and overall quality and volume of options - I will definitely be back!",

It was happy hour by chance, and we ended up getting the small $8 pizzas (ummm amazing deal because their smalls are pretty much a medium) and they were both SO good. We ordered the fennel & sausage pizza, along with the chicken pesto. We also were brought out some garlic artichoke bread for free, since the kitchen had accidentally made 2 and they had an extra one. That was super good too. All in all, a really great experience with great food and great service. We will be going back for sure!",

We had a large group of 12 with us and right off the back they didn't take reservations. The lady on the phone suggested that we get there 30 minutes prior to our scheduled meet up time to get a table for dinner. As soon as we got to the restaurant I spoke to the three hostesses who had to be at least 16 years old and talking about personal topics at the hostess stand, said that it would be and hour and forty five minutes wait.  I have never heard of such a long wait time. As we waited there, there were other people coming in after us with two groups of six, two groups of five and a group of four and all got seated right away. After about an hour wait and several annoying chats with the hostess, we asked to speak to a manager. The manager \"Ransom\" came to speak to us and we told him our issue. As soon as he responded, he clearly had a little attitude about how we felt. As soon as we called him out about the attitude he quickly denied it. He then told us he would work on getting us seated. It only took a few minutes for him to get us seats. I don't think the young hostess were properly trained. Walking through the dining room I noticed multiple tables available for seating, yet we were stuck outside standing and waiting for over and hour.   We sat down and right away got our drinks ordered. As soon as we got our drinks, we didn't see our waiter for several minutes. We noticed he was busy dealing with issues with other upset customers. One of our people had to wave down another waiter to take our order. With out hesitation Donna was kind enough to take on our group and get our orders in.  After serval attempts to get refills on our drinks. A friend had to get up and go to the bar and re fill a drink. After another long wait we finally got our food and all enjoyed the great pizza and calzones.  There were a few issues with the bills and all the split checks were wrong so Donna had to fix the checks several times which took even longer.   I have never been so happy to leave a place. Good food but horrible, unprofessional service and long wait times. We got there at 6:30pm didn't get seated till 8:00pm, didn't get food till after 9:30 pm and finally left around 10:15pm. Almost four hours of my life wasted.   Thank you to Donna for stepping up and taking care of us the best you could. Sadly I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.",

Stick with the pizza because the kids meals are sized for four year olds. The kids ordered spaghetti and got less than a cup each. The waitress suggested we BUY another meal for them. The free scoop of gelato that came with the kids meal was smaller than the tablespoon they gave them to eat the dessert.   My wife and friends ordered the pizza which was ok. I ordered a cup of soup and sandwich because I'm a little tired of eating pizza every week. For nearly $4 I got a double shot of flavorless minestrone. The sandwich was good but not for the prices we paid.   The new location is nice. But the ambiance didn't make up for the portions, the wait, or the lackluster waitING staff and service.",

My favorite thing, though, is that you can choose to build your own pizza. The only thing that somewhat annoys me about building your own is that they charge by number of toppings, and some of the options apparently \"count as two toppings.\" One of those happens to be bell peppers. I love bell peppers, and they're super cheap as pizza toppings, so why should I be getting charged double what they charge for pepperoni or tomatoes? I just don't get it.  Other than that, there's really nothing to complain about. The food is delish, the service is on-point, and they have a delectible cannoli! Mmmmm I love me some cannoli. I also like that they deliver now! At their original location I don't think delivery was an option (I could be wrong) but now, as long as you live close enough, delivery comin' atcha!",

We stopped by at 6 and expected to have to wait, judging by the cars in the lot, but there were plenty of tables for 2-4 - hey, it can't be easy to put together seating for 14 but they did it that evening - twice while we were there. But I can't see there will be a problem for a couple or two.   Service was top notch. We wanted two plates. A pasta to share, Chicken Marsala, and a pizza as second plate. No problem! The pasta was out in a flash and truly delicious. As we finished the first plate our pizza arrived. Hot, perfectly baked, and wonderful.   I am rarely delighted by a restaurant but this night turned out perfectly. This is our new go-to pizza/pasta place and I can't wait to try their take out. You can get a pizza ready for the oven, or 3/4 baked for warming at home, or fully baked.   Go here. Eat. Enjoy.",

Unlike most days, my experience this Friday night was awful. I usually sit at the bar and get better service than sitting at a table. Madison is always extremely friendly and inviting, always treating us like family. This Friday I was let down. New faces behind the bar always bring some reservation, but I always give the new people a chance. The bartender, I believe Alex, was not at all friendly or inviting. She hardly ever checked in on us and didn't seem very happy to be at work. Whenever I usually come in Madison, even when busy, goes out of her way to make my group feel welcome. I can't say we had this experience on Friday. It was not at all an inviting, pleasant experience. On top of that the food was just ok, nothing special. Not sure if the poor service put a sour taste in my mouth. Usually the sweet sauce hits the spot, however that wasn't the case Friday. There was once a homey, family vibe going to Spinatos, which doesn't seem to be the case these days. I think I'll take a peek at the bar next time and decide whether or not to stay depending on who's working. It really does make a difference. Management needs to talk to the new bartender because she was passionless.",

I can honestly say the food was tasty, but man was it still disappointing at the same time. So the calzone came with a french dip de jour type sauce which I guess they heat up so hot that it melted the plastic lids of the containers they were in. And during the delivery route of the driver, the sauce just spilled EVERYWHERE. Upon arrival, and the driver handing it to me, both the calzone and the pizza box were completely soaked. Calzone absorbed the sauce and was beyond soggy. Pizza was less affected but still to an extent. That idk how much more food was stacked on top of it in his one go about, but the top of the pizza box was crushed in and all of the cheese/toppings stuck to the top of the box and we had to scrap it off back onto the pizza. If I ever get a chance to try this place again, I'd like to dine in or pick up, but repeat on delivery is an absolute no. Despite all of the mishaps, at least food tastes decent. Overall we were all very let down. My coworker who recommended them definitely felt let down the most.",

The servers are great but the host/hostesses are always lost and terrible at welcoming people. The dining room is beautiful but is almost always closed; you're forced to sit in the front dining room which reminds one of a Pizza Hut set up. But again...this actually is a great place, nice location and delicious food.",

After recieving our food we realize we were sent a Sicilian style pizza. Called to figure out a solution and was basically told \"you ordered it, its your fault\". The only problem with that is that due to how their site looks on a mobile phone the only option we saw was a small or large and apparently that was Sicilian. This review is not about their food its about a missed opportunity to assist your customers. Instead of putting the blame on me try to further understand the situation and provide options. Lastly for the manager that didnt even come to the phone I hope you take this feedback and further step into the leadership role and hop on the phone to speak to your customers instead hiding when there is an issue.",

    "text": "\"The only thing better than carbs, is more carbs.\"John D  While en route home from the Grand Canyon we were all getting pretty famished, and wanted to pick-up some grub to eat at home. My Sis recommended we give Spinato's Pizzeria (SP) a call because what's better after a long day of sitting on our asses but to carb-load before bed, right? She suggested the Baked Spaghetti Calzone and my BIL wanted his favorite Italian Beef Sandwich. So, I looked them up on my handy-dandy Yelp app, made the call, picked it up and off we went to Piggy Town!  Italian Beef Sandwich- This comes served pretty plain with just some slices of Roasted Italian Beef and Mozzarella melted on top; it also comes with a hot Giardeniera pepper mix and au jus on the side. I wasn't too impressed with this, as I feel I've had better. The baguette was a bit dry, and the meat seemed overcooked. Maybe it's one of those things better eaten-in and might've suffered from the 20 minute ride home?? Either way the au jus and Giardeniera mix helped salvage it. 3*  Baked Spaghetti Calzone- When my sister first suggested this I did the proverbial double-take! You mean they take pizza dough and wrap it around spaghetti, marinara, cheese and sausage?!? This is either geniusor THIS! IS! SPARTA!!!????!! *Ahem* Well, it turns out it's pure genius. Who knew that the best way to serve up carbs was to envelop them in more carbs! Pure carboholics delight, folks... You need this in your life! 5*  Service & Ambiance- I didn't actually go into the restaurant, as this SP has a separate area for pick-up order but the decor seemed to be slightly upscale for a Pizza joint. Service was friendly and the food was being put together as I arrived, so no complaints here. 4*  Value- I actually had to go to their website to look as i don't really remember the prices but it seems to be pretty typical for quality Italian food. Not expensive, but not a bargain. 3.5*   SP provided us with the nice full bellies that we needed at the end of a long week on the road and subpar food. Highly recommended for the Carbaholic inside all of us, and definitely give their Spaghetti Calzone a shot! I wish I was in town longer to give SP's Pizza a shot, as I see it seems to be pretty popular. Next time, Gadget...",

    "text": "My husband, son, daughter and I had an early dinner Monday evening at Spinato's.  My daughter has Celiac Disease and Spinato's is one of the few restaurants that takes precautions in the kitchen--keeping her food from cross contamination.  We were greeted immediately upon walking in by the hostess whom was busy seating another couple; she told us she would be right with us.   While we were waiting, another couple came in and asked us if Spinato's is the \"best in Phoenix\"? My daughter and I replied: Yes they are. I explained about my daughter's Celiac Disease. I added that Spinato's is careful with her food and that they have gluten free options on their menu.   Upon being seated, I went to use the restroom. The restroom is very clean and tidy--this is important in restaurants we dine at--it speaks volumes about the restaurant itself. Our waiter Jordan arrived as my husband, son and I joined my daughter at the table.  He took our drink order and quickly returned with them to the table. I ordered an ice tea, my husband-water and my daughter and son had Pepsi. My tea was perfect--again it tells me that the staff knows how to make ice tea, as some places I have visited have either really watered down tea or its too strong. After giving us time to peruse the menu, Jordan took our order. My husband and I ordered off the happy hour menu Jordan had given us. We decided on the chicken wings-bone in, mild buffalo sauce and a small two item pizza with pepperoni and mushroom. My daughter ordered the turkey pesto sandwich on gluten free bread. It comes with kettle chips and a crispy pickle. My son ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce.  We didn't have to wait very long before the food arrived. The hot wings (6) half-dozen, were hot, fresh and delicious with just the right amount of sauce and spice to them. On the side were crispy carrots and celery. We had blue cheese to dip them in. Our pizza was fabulous as usual. Spinato's has a unique sauce that has a little bit of sweet to it-yummy. The pizza was crispy and good. My son's spaghetti with meat sauce arrived in a bowl with a nice slice of garlic bread. He enjoyed every bite of it. My daughter's turkey pesto sandwich was flavorful. The turkey was tender and moist.   Jordan was very attentive. He checked on us often and made sure everything was OK. He refilled our drinks and he cleared away our dishes. I think he should be recognized because he works really hard for his customer's. I want to return and ask for him so we can be seated in his area of the restaurant. I could tell he likes his job and cares about his customers.   After Jordan had already cashed out our bill, I decided to order the cannoli for dessert. It had cream and chocolate chips inside of it. It was crispy on the outside. It was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal.   We will definitely be returning in the near future. We love Spinato's. They make you feel welcome and like family when dining there.",

Second to that, the staff is educated on cross contamination and up front about their kitchen. The gluten free cheesy-garlic bread is *to die for* and the pizza is amazing, not soggy or limp like most gluten free pizza crusts.  The staff is always super friendly and the prices are reasonable for a family owned, quality pizza place.  Happy hour prices are great, and if you're just looking for some snacking/drinks, I would highly recommend going during that time.",

It is so much bigger, spacier, and upgraded. It did lose a little bit of that personal feel but the same great taste is there. Many of the crew from the old location came over and they are just as nice and friendly as before. One of my favorite things about this place is the sauce. I can't begin to describe it and you just have to taste it for yourself but it really brings something to their dishes.  This is apparent because they do sell it to go as well. There are many great pizzas to choose from here and all are delicious. One of my favorite things to try are their calzones that are stuffed with spaghetti and meatball and you will not be hungry the rest of the day!!  A must eat local pizzeria!

I also had a Chicken Caesar and it was really good.  I'd order that again.

They eventually picked up and informed that they do not accept reservations. So I asked about the wait. I was put on hold again. They picked up and told me 20 minutes. I asked if I could put our name on the list. I was told they don't do that either. So when we walked in, we were dismayed to find that they now had a 35 minute wait.  A party of 6 is unusual enough that it should merit some consideration. I find this to be a weakness in their commitment to customer service.  We drove across the street to Stock and Stable and were seated immediately.  Our experience with their food had only been positive. But this was a deal breaker.",

    "text": "I held my 30th birthday celebration at Spinato's, based in large part on the fact that they have seating adequate for 12 people, and because I've dined here before and enjoy the food. Sadly, this experience was not acceptable and I won't soon forget about it.  I called Spinato's early in the week attempting to make a reservation, which they do not accept. They said it is first come, first served. I attempted to give them my plans and timing by phone when I called to serve as a warning to be prepared for a large group, and they refused to write anything down.   I arrived at 12:45pm on Sunday, and told the hostess Maria that I have a party of 12. She asked for 20 minutes to have the seating ready. Sounds good so far! Well, it took nearly 90 minutes before we were seated. The manager on duty, Bobby, came to apologize for the wait and say we would be seated within 10 minutes, and that they were opening up the extended seating in the private room. Those 10 minutes passed and we still weren't seated. My two friends were having drinks in the bar area, and noticed lots of table space available that we could have been seated at, but the tables were not clean. My friends intervened and asked the staff to clean their tables and please seat us. So the private dining area never happened, and we were seated in the bar area.  Then there was the service. The restaurant was by no means packed. And I think our server was simply overwhelmed; perhaps she was covering too many tables.  Refill service on beverages was virtually non-existent. Our table was not being well monitored. Then one of my guests had a huge hair in her pasta dish. Food was brought out in three waves - so it was at least 10 minutes before everyone had their food. Attention to detail was not an area of concern at the restaurant, this time.  My food was fine, and Bobby comped my meal due to the bad experience (without me asking for a comp). I'm not a chronic complainer - I was going to keep my mouth shut. He was apologetic but said \"we were just slammed\". Instead of blaming this terrible experience on being slammed (which visually was not the case), why not just admit we failed to meet your expectations and we are genuinely sorry? I don't want to hear why you think this all went downhill - just be accountable and don't assign fault to any single cause. Because this was a failure on every front.   I'm deeply saddened by this experience. I went here to have a great time to celebrate 30 years of life, and now I'm left with memories of a really bad dining experience. I live right around the corner, but I think I'm done with Spinato's.  You've significantly failed to meet the expectations of your guests. It's a shame you were clearly ill prepared and didn't seem to care a great deal. Apologies are easy to give verbally, but the service never improved after they were made. Actions speak far louder than words.  Suggestions: 1. Reconsider your policy on reservations - it will help you plan for large groups and not be in disarray when a dozen people show up. 2. Staff appropriately. Don't stretch your servers too thin. 3. Hair nets and hats in the kitchen for all staff handling food. 4. Pay attention to detail. Entrees should all arrive simultaneously (or close to it). 5. When things go terribly wrong, take ultimate accountability. Don't cite the reasons why everything went poorly - just accept responsibility for failing to meet expectations. Your guests aren't concerned with rationale. They just want a good experience.",

Because everything is cold I look at the pizza more closely.  It was a full inch smaller than I order.  Yes I measured it, seems like they enjoy mediocrity.  Cheese seems to be lacking, I mean most people won't notice a couple ounces missing, but I do.  I would guesstimate 6 ounces on the 15\" pizza.  And I made only 40-50 pies 6 days a week in high school.  Boss was cheap some employees lackadaisical and it apears to be the same ethics at this Spinatos.

And their cranberry Apple gorgonzola salad is the bomb dot com.   Pricing is a little weird - you can't order a specialty pizza without a certain topping. They come exactly as they are. If you want even just a slight variation from a specialty pizza you have to build your own and pay per topping. Not a good or a bad thing, just an FYI.   Service is just okay. The host was awesome but our waitress clearly went out for a cigarette break multiple times during out dinner. I'm not a health freak and sometimes even I'll have a drag when I'm feeling angsty and drinking a cold beer, but I do not like smelling cigarettes while I eat. It was like a little Marlboro cloud came around every time food and drinks were brought over or taken away. It took my back to my high school days working at TGI Fridays - we always had the pre shift meeting outside so the team could have a cig before the dinner rush. You're classier than that Spinato's.",

    "text": "Big fan of Spinato's ever since I tried their restaurant location in Ahwatukee.  The crust is always perfectly cooked and very thin, so it's nice & crispy.  The service has been consistently great.  Tonight, I tried one of their cocktails, Sriracha Mary (basically a bloody mary with more kick & flavor) and it was garnished with pepperoni slices, pimento olive and cherry tomato.  It was a well balanced drink and I'm glad I tried it.  For dinner, we started off with the stuffed mushrooms, which is always a nice start.  The cheese is creamy and flavored well.  Then we had the Apple & Pecan salad, which is just right.  The tartness from the green apples & cranberries blends well with the bitter mix of field greens.  And for our pizza, we tried the Super Six combo and added Fresh garlic and feta cheese, a complete masterpiece full of flavor.  The only problem I had was the lighting in the bar area, it was a bit dark and took a minute to adjust my eyes to review the menu.  If you ever get a chance, definitely check it out.",

    "text": "After my last experience, I think I'm gonna have to delete Spinato's from my go-to pizza spot. I've frequented this place multiple times, maybe once a week even and I always seem to look past the bad service and just visit for the taste of the pizza alone because well, it was just that good!  After a long week, my bf and I along with his parents went over for happy hour/dinner tonight. We were seated at a booth and the server was nice.  I ordered the usual - gluten free combo with jalapenos along with HH wings.    We received our order of wings first.  The wings were being devoured and we were emptying our plates. As the server starts picking up the empty plates to make way for the pizza, he slips and the plates come crashing on our table.  Ranch and pizza sauce splatters everywhere including on our clothes!  My bf had ranch all over his pants and shirt. It was the most awkward moment!  We all fell silent, the server is apologizing profusely, and a few employees come by giving us napkins and club soda.  Why, thanks! The pizza gets to our table and the table is still messy with ranch sauce. The accident happened so fast and I felt like the employees just dropped things to help us clean up, but they didn't clean up the table for us!  We were wiping the table down ourselves.   We start eating our pizzas and things seem to simmer down. Then, here comes the aftermath. My bf's dad starts drinking his water and there is a chicken wing bone in his cup! Oh nasty. Then to make things worse, the mgr (I think) came over and said if I wanted, I can get my shirt drycleaned and they would reimburse me so she gave me a business card that was written, \"Good for drycleaning of one shirt\". My, that was a nice gesture (saying sarcastically).  That would mean that I would have to drive to a drycleaner to drop off my shirt, then pick it up, then go over to Spinato's to get reimbursed for $2!  The gas alone to get to and from the drycleaners and to head to Spinato's would be more than $2! Are you kidding?!  Thanks for inconveniencing me for reimbursement!  Nothing on our check was comp'd. As an \"exceptional service\" practice, comping a dinner for a restaurant's mistake/accident and the inconvenience of even going to a drycleaner would have been the best thing to do.   I used to love the pizza, but now - I just don't want to consider even coming back.",

I will say, I picked off a few bites of the Italian sausage- Tasty. Roasted fennel- Very good. We also ordered boneless wings mild. Those were pretty good.  I'm sure we won't go back.

What a shame after 12 years I need to find a new pizza place because the manager has no customer service skills. The funny part is they give sauce with some but not all calzones.

They have a dimly lit dining hall, a seperate brightly lit dining area, and then a bar area with booths, tables, bar seating, and Tv's, as well as outdoor seating.  They have a menu that I would expect to find at a pizzeria: pizza (duh), salad, sandwiches, and appetizers. I opted for a glass of rose, shared bruschetta, and shared a greek salad. My hunny had a personal size pizza. It's probably a good time to mention they have 4 different sized pizzas to choose from.  We came in at around 7:30pm on a Friday. We had good service and were seated immediately. The bruschetta was delicious. They were huge, crunchy pieces of bread. The Greek salad was amazing.  There was ample parking outside and it's hard to miss the restaurant on the corner of the intersection. And bonus - they have half price bottles of wine for Wine Wednesdays!!   They will probably see me again on Wednesday..",

    "text": "Spinatos has been my fathers favorite pizza restaurant for a number of years. For his birthday, we decided to eat there. Our wait for a table was absurd, seeing as so many were empty, and they claim to not take reservations. After being seated, orders taken, etc, the wait for food was a little much, but that wasn't a big deal for us. I ordered 'da greek', with sausage. Upon arrival, I noticed a lack of sausage on the pizza. After a slice, not tasting any, I concluded they must have forgotten. Having worked in the food industry myself, I could understand, and when I asked our waitress she offered to have the kitchen whip up a smaller pizza, and ensuring they would add sausage. About five minutes went by, when my waitress, looking a bit chastised, was lead to our table by a manager, who proceeded to lecture ME on the process of their pizzas, essentially saying that the sausage was placed under the cheese, before proceeding to insist that I rip up my food to prove her point. True enough, there was sausage. About five, quarter-sized pieces of sausage were on my large sized pizza. If she'd done it to educate me, I'd probably be fine with it, however she also canceled the promised, smaller pizza. In light of the fact that I couldn't even taste the sausage, I was understandably miffed. My server gave her own opinion once the clearly vindicated-feeling manager left: that the fact I couldn't taste any sausage alone ought to merit the second pizza. I cannot say enough how much I agreed with her. It was both insulting and infuriating to have management contradict an employee, then to lecture a customer in the fashion I was. While I'm sure I will eat there again, it won't be a place I recommend to others, and I won't eat there outside of trying to make my father happy. This failure of customer service falls entirely on poor managers. Our server was perfectly polite and much more personable than the manager. Spinatos could learn from some of the new pizza shops coming to town, they are no longer the only place for pizza in Phoenix, and cannot afford to spurn customers.",

    "text": "Easy to find, Easy well lit parking, very nice looking building. Once inside, we were greeted and seated immediately...7:00 Sunday evening. We took a small table in the bar with stuffed chairs. Our server was there immediately with menus and for our drink order. A very personable and attractive young lady named Amanda...great attitude too. Prices on all items were rational and reasonable in my opinion.  We ordered wine and water, perused the menu and finally decided on a salad and sandwich for my wife and spaghetti marinara with sausage for me. Drinks came quickly as did her very well presented salad. The salad was shared a bit and was crisp, cold and fresh with a tasty homemade Italian style dressing. Within 10 minutes, we each had our entrees.  My wife's large turkey sandwich with chips was well made and well presented in a large basket. My pasta and excellent homemade sausage was in a good size pasta bowl and well dressed with marinara...lots of sausage just right on the sauce...the pasta was slightly al dente...just right...well cooked and firm.  Amanda was checking with us every 5 minutes or so and keeping drinks refilled. Very attentive but not overly so.  The bar area is filled with TV's and it was Sunday night football on all. No sound to interfere with our peaceful meal. The place is busy but not annoyingly so. As we were finishing our food, I engaged Amanda in a brief conversation about football in Phoenix and life in general. She was a bright and willing talker and our brief conversation was enjoyable. She brought us our check and cashiered for us as well.  The restaurant interior is nicely furnished, adequately lit and architecturally attractive...a very pleasant environment. Noise levels are low and there's sufficient aisle space so that there is no sense of congestion.  Overall, an enjoyable dining experience that I would happily repeat. I would recommend this to a friend.  $30 out the door with a tip for Amanda extra.",

We were in the mood for some pizza and salad so chose Spinatos on 7th St.  Upon walking in the front door during the noon hour on a Saturday there was no hostess to be found.   We waited a couple minutes and then dipped our head into the bar and the bartender looked at us and mumbled something but acted like he wasn't there to assist us either.   We started looking for a table in the bar area and then the waitress showed up mentioning that only the bar top was open seating.  Seeing as the bar side had 3 people at the bar top and literally no other patrons we picked a booth where it would be easy to sit our daughter in her car seat.  The hostess went out of her way to be snippy that it wasn't open seating.  Perhaps a better response would have been \"sorry I didn't see you when you came in, I saw you were looking at tables in there, if you want to pick a table in the bar area go ahead and I'll follow you with menus.\"    We got up and left and had a good experience down the street at Culinary Dropout/The Yard! I recommend you do the same if you read this.",

I was picking up food to go once with my fiance (around $40) and he noticed they sell vodka sauce. When asked if we could try some we were told we would have to buy a jar of it. I called to see if they take reservations because my uncle wanted to go there for his birthday. There was 12 in my party. But you can not make a reservation and as I asked a few more questions I kept having to repeat myself because her answer did not make sense. If she just would have listened to me rather than playing around with whoever was next to her, the phone call could have been much less frustrating.",

My boyfriend and I have a monthly Spinato's date that started prior to their move to the new location and will continue as long as they stay open and we live in the valley.  YES, it's that good.  The crust is thin and perfect, the slightly sweet pizza sauce, the minced garlic, loads of spinach, diced tomatoes and cheese.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I've had other selections from the menu as well, including the Italian Beef sandwich, all have been excellent, but since trying the Mama Spinato's Signature I haven't been able to justify ordering anything else.  The staff is always friendly and the new location is nice.  I am originally from the Midwest and am familiar with their sister chain, Aurelio's, and I'm so glad I can come here and have a taste of home.",

I likes the fact that there was a completely separate area for the take out patrons (you don't enter into the main dining entrance).   The large pizza is huge. I deep dish pizza is definitely a must try for all you bread lovers out there. We ordered Nicole's special and it was delicious.

    "text": "Spinato's: Now better at nickel and dime-ing you than most airlines!  I was super excited that Spinato's had moved closer to my neighborhood and happily walked there a few weeks after their re-opening.  The new location is gorgeous and the outdoor seating area looks nice too.  Our food was fine, pretty good in fact.  The meatball appetizer is tasty and the pizza came out quickly.  The big problem came when we were presented our bill.  I ordered a regular pizza off of the menu but asked for the onions to be removed.  I was surprised to see that I had been charged for a custom \"make your own\" pizza, which cost three dollars more than the pizza I had ordered.    The waitress shrugged off our complaint as \"that's our policy\" so I had to escalate to a manager.  The manager was very polite and apologetic but insisted that this was the owner's policy: Any time a change is made to a pizza it has to be priced out at a higher per-ingredient price.  I argued that it was completely illogical to charge me more for something that actually had less ingredients but he suggested it was because the kitchen staff need consistency when something is ordered (evidently you can't  have it your way here without paying handsomely).  Naturally this fact is not printed anywhere on the menu.  After much arguing and a million excuses the price was resolved to our satisfaction but I left with a bad flavor in my house...and not from the pizza.  In closing.  Spinato's has good food but be careful of what you order.  With Oregano's and Pizza Heaven right around the corner there are plenty of better, safer choices and that's where I will be spending my money next time.",

I am a big fan of their food and was excited for them when they opened on 7th Street because the building is prettier than their old 12th and Glendale location.    Yelp read my mind when it said, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"    I ordered the Mama's signature pizza via delivery.  It is not my first time getting a delivery order from them, so I was shocked when I felt the bottom of the box dripping with oil.  I'm not exaggerating when I say the box looked like it had been floating on a pile of water before arriving at my house.  I took a bite of the pizza and was even more disappointed.  The crust was crumbling because it was loaded with grease.  If I knew their quality would go down this badly after the change in location, I would have written to the owners everyday to convince them to stay where they were.",

    "text": "We have been going to the 12th Street/Glendale Spinatos for about 10 years -- since well before it was still a BYOB pizza joint years ago.  We were eager to share the new location with family visiting from Boston and Oakland, along with my elderly parents on the eve of my Dad's 81st birthday.  I know, you shouldn't go to a new restaurant in the first few weeks.  But this is Spinatos -- they have 5 restaurants with a hundred years of experience.  Surely they will open a restaurant right.  Right?  Wrong.  We were there the same night as RD above, the Friday after Thanksgiving.  This was a first week nightmare at the new Spinatos.    4:30 Called to alert them we had a group of 12 coming in an hour.  They don't take reservations yet, but was told it would not be a problem since they have lots of room.  5:30  We were told wait would be 20-25 mins.  Hmmm.  OK. Went to the bar with our 12 (7 adults/5 kids) and had a drink.   6:10 40 minutes in.  Hostess said it'll be just more 10 minutes.  Just waiting for a party to pay. Said we could go next door to order ahead to save time.  We did (turned out to be a bad move, b/c then we were \"pot committed\" to stay there....)  6:20:  50 minutes in.  Hostess again promised our table was almost ready.  I checked where she planned to put us and all the tables were occupied with new customers.  6:30:  1 hour in.  We finally got to speak with a manager.  He apologized profusely for their inept hostess staff that kept promising us tables that weren't there...Said it would be another 25 minutes.  7:00 90 minutes in.  Finally seated at a mishmash of different sized tables cobbled together in the back room.  Food that we had pre-ordered almost an hour before we were seated still took another 15 minutes to arrive.  Half our party had to leave as soon as the food got there.  We packed up the rest and left shortly afterwords.  EXTREMELY disappointing.    The kicker:  a table of 14 that got there AFTER us was seated BEFORE us.   \"Why?\" I asked.  \"Well, they called ahead\" I was told.  Are you kidding me -- so did I, and you don't take reservations.  In the end, the manager's discounted our meal, and I tipped the servers well -- it wasn't their fault.  But mere money can't make up for a truly lousy experience -- on what was to be a big, happy, stress-free family dinner.  Spinatos:  Train your people to tell the truth and deal with mistakes quickly and honestly.  To paraphrase the Dread Pirate Roberts/Westley, \"We are people of action; lies do not become us.\"",

    "text": "The good: The restaurant is still pretty new and looks fantastic.  They have a dedicated takeout area, so you don't get that awkward \"go to the bar\" issue with the hostess and bar tender.  Their chicken parm and baked spaghetti are good, as are their meatballs and pizza.  Be warned that the pizza is VERY heavy, and not the lighter, fluffy/chewy fare found at Sauce, North, or Federal.  I'd put it more along the lines of Pat's Sicilian, Uno's, or similar \"deep dish\" or \"pan\" pizzas that are fully loaded up with sauce, cheese, and toppings.  The bad: They removed their gigantic, delicious, affordable, perfectly toasted chicken parm sandwich.  That alone is taking them from 4 to 3 stars.  If you're looking for something lighter here, you really have very few options.  The ugly: The golden bbq wings were the most disgusting chicken I've ever tasted in my entire life.  I wish the description said they were basically mustard and nothing else.  Thankfully the server swapped them out for an order of meatballs.  The seafood pasta was also disappointing, with the vodka sauce being pretty weak and the noodles all sticking together in a giant clump.  I've also received good service here.  The chocolate chip cookies sold at the market/takeout area are pretty good, but a little bit too close to well-baked (not chewy/soft) Nestle Tollhouse for me to buy them for myself.  Oh, and the parking situation is FANTASTIC due to them sharing Bashas' huge lot!",

They took our order after 5 minutes which was good . However  the pizza did not get to our table for 45 minutes  which was too long . They came and apologize  three times but offered nothing for our wait . We asked for take out boxes and this took another  7 minutes  all in all two hours  for dinner. The food was good  but we were very unhappy  with the wait.  I don't think we will  be  going back soon",

I'm not sure why I continue to frustrate myself time after time by ordering Spinatos pizza. If this were a one time incident I could understand. Long waits happen every time!  I might be able to look past it if it weren't for the lack of customer service and non-friendly approach each time I come to this specific location. No one ever seems to be bothered that you've waited longer than quoted and no one takes responsibility.  Tonight I was told there's a new girl in the kitchen and she's not keeping them up on times. What about the last two times I've been in? Is there a new employee each time I call in an order?  I really enjoy the pizza here and it's convenient that I live five minutes away but today may be my final visit here.",

We decided to give it another try,  not much has changed a service was slow this time they remembered her meal but it was completely wrong.

I made sure the person taking my order knew it needed to be ready at 6 because I need to stop by on my way home from work get home quick and leave almost right away as I had to be somewhere by 730. I arrived at the restaurant a couple of minutes before six and my food was not yet ready. Which is fine. However after sitting there for more than 15 minutes I was told that my pizza had to be remade because it got lost. I was offered some cookies as an apology. however I cannot eat them because of my celiac. I looked at my receipt and it said in bold letters three separate times pick up at six in big bold letters. I'm very disappointed and sad I gave such a big tip as my requests were not followed.  Finally got my pizzas at 630. I will think twice before visiting again.",

Anyway they didn't care so I am in the process of becoming a thorn in their side. I have pictures of the violation. So I come prepared.

We ordered carry out and really loved their pizzas. We went for their thin and crispy crust and my favorite part was the sauce! I don't even know how to explain it - it is kind of more along the lines of tomato paste but in a good way and just so dang rich and tasty.   We ordered one of their Margherita pizzas that had tomato, mozzarella, EVOO, and fresh basil and the second one was their famous Mamma's signature fresh spinach that had red sauce, mozzarella, spinach, and garlic. Yum!!!   We'll definitely be back to try other varieties because I'm a fan of thin crust pizza and Spinato's didn't disappoint.",

Yes, the children's menu does have spag and meatballs, and not just one but two large ones.  She ate so much, she said she was trying to move the food aside in her stomach to make room for more.   Alas, it didn't work.   Interesting phenomenon if it happened, though.  I ordered the chicken alfredo since I am a lover of cream sauces.   I wanted the pasta with the shrimp, but I understood from our server it was the small ones albeit they are called tiger shrimp on the menu.  My sweetie loved her spag and meatballs.   I tried it as well.  Not bad.   I don't care for the tomato-based sauces but the balls weren't bad.  I loved my chicken alfredo!   The pasta was not over cooked -- ughhh!! -- and the chicken was tasty and not rubbery.   The flavorings meshed just right with the ingredients included.    Gelato was included with the kids' meal.   My granddaughter asked for the chocolate.   She didn't care for it, but I did!   I was more than happy to relieve her of it.   Large pieces of chocolate that hit the spot.  I was glad I didn't overeat on the pasta!  Alexandra was our server, friendly and professional.   Yes, I'd return.",

The customer service is very good and the right mix of attentive and letting you enjoy your meal in peace.  Some people try too hard at trying to be best pals with you in the hopes of driving up their tip. This staff here is friendly, honest about their likes and dislikes, and seems to know that when you are out with your wife, it's her you want to talk to. They still manage to keep my water filled and smoothly take care of everything.  The food is very tasty and possibly the only reason I can't give out a 5 is its so hard to get a table because everyone else feels like me about the place. Please please please get a bigger place for your Tempe location! Other than that is 5 material for sure!",

    "text": "I would like to address first off that the staff, management, and everyone affiliated with Spinato's have always been wonderful and family-inviting in nature.  The problem is not with anyone working at the establishments, but for products of old vs. products of new.  I would have liked to have contacted Spinato's directly; however, their site does not have an available \"contact/review/concern\" from the public; therefore, I am using YELP to voice my concern(s) that apply to all of their locations.  I have eaten at the restaurant for years and watched this local company grow and prosper.  As they have grown, I would like to make note that some of my favorite desserts and now their gluten free pizza crust (hopefully temporary) has disappeared and been replaced by a substandard and less appealing dish.    The desserts, especially their original gelatos, gluten free German chocolate bars I miss; however, they were not the purpose for dining at the restaurant: it was the wonderful gluten free pizza crust that kept me returning on a weekly basis..sometimes twice a week. BUT, that all changed. Spinato's is now using a substandard, cardboard texture that sticks to your teeth that is a tasteless, awful substitute that is not up to the caliber of the restaurant or to the discerning patrons.   I sent my pizza back after I had the wonderful management  and a respectful bartender/server try it as well.  That happened last week.  Yesterday, I ventured a return as I was wanting my favorite pizza; however, I was told that the crust was the same, and that it had become an issue with others. I asked why it has it not been changed?  I was told to contact headquarters/head office via online, but I can't seem to find a place to contact unless I wish to apply for a job/career with said company.  The \"family ad\" has become a \"corporate ad.\" I fear I am going to have to search for another pizza restaurant that will accommodate my taste and leave Spinato's, unless some of these \"family feel\" desserts and dining options can be remedied.",

Other reviewers mention Chicago style pizza--ours was super thin crust but I'm guessing they have authentic Chicago style as an option to order? I'd have like to tried that if so--regardless, the thin crust is delicious. The spicy Italian meatball pizza is simple but super delicious. The cheese is perfect melty, the sauce has a good flavor, the prices are fair. Plus it's just a nice restaurant aesthetically so plan to dine in and take your time. I also tried the Hawaiian, the Veggie, and the Meat-lovers (we were in a big group): all were great.",

    "text": "One of the best Chicago pizza restaurants in the Phoenix valley!  For this of you who like a Chicago deeper style chewy soft crust with a slight bottom charred and slightly sweet pizza sauce - it cannot be beat.   Generous, top quality pizza toppings ranging from sweet sausage, fresh mushrooms, paper thin pepperoni slices, among other great choices.   The traditional spaghetti and meatballs with meat sauce and mushrooms is a great choice.   Excellent service and the location near central and camelback is new, inviting and includes a fast pick up door and parking spaces",

Morgan the GM helped my husband and I plan the gathering for food and beverages up to 75 people. Morgan was patient, kind and extremely professional helpful us figure out the menu of assorted pizza, meatballs and garlic bread etc. Our group also had 2 servers (I'm sorry I can't remember their names). They made sure the food was hot and well stocked and all guests were taken care of.  Everything was wonderful! We couldn't have asked for better service and comfort food.

It was actually my intent to go to Pita Jungle, which is next to Spinato's. but, it was so Dayum hot outside, I ducked into Spinato's instead of walking the extra 50 yards to PJ. I should have sucked it up, dealt with the blazing sun and continued walking past Spinato's. This was my 3rd time in this joint, and I am certain now, that the food here is just NOT good. I ordered the penne pasta with Italian sausage. Although the penne pasta was only a tad bit over cooked, it was the thick paste like sauce that was sweet as candy, and the 4 or 5 day old Italian sausage sprinkled into the mix, that made me just want to pick all those little slices out, and toss them to the pigeons, (that made this dining experience my last one here). BUT, sitting inside at the bar, made that whim an impossibility. I could go on, but WHY! I will NEVER EVER, eat here again!",

Veggie pizza has a really nice assortment of different toppings. Cheese is always a good classic, and sausage is hearty and delish.  The Sicilian pizza is pretty good. The sauce is a bit sweet, but it's huge, and again, a good value for what you get. I think in the future I'll stick with the thin crust. Salads are large and very filling. You could easily split one with someone in addition to a small pizza and have a nice, filling meal.  If you're in the mood for pizza, especially if you have a group of kids, Spinato's is a good place to go.",

The thicker crust was very thick and bready not at all chewy, had way too much sauce and we counted 10 pepperonis on the entire large pizza. Also pepperonis were buried under everything so not crispy on the top. The sauce tasted like sugared tomato paste. The thin crust was very crackery, the toppings again were very sparse and the pizza overall was way too salty. Pizza was cold upon delivery but we are at the very end range of their delivery boundaries and it did come within the expected time. I don't think I would get this again.

I showed up after 35 because I like to get my pizza hot, and sometimes those wait times are sandbagged.   The place was hopping, and I don't just mean the restaurant. Even their take-out side was packed. I was still greeted warmly when I entered, and waited upon promptly. It wasn't ready yet, but she went back tithe kitchen and told me it would be no longer than 9 minutes. Pretty specific, but it was absolutely correct. The nice girl helping me even opened the pizza box to double check everything was in order. They did this for everyone. I appreciate that, because I hate getting home to find a mistaken pizza. So do they.   The place was immaculate. They just opened a month ago, sure, but the place was looking pristine. The goodies in their bakery display looked pretty delicious as well.   I'll be ordering from them again.",

I'm glad to say we had a pleasant experience and will definitely be coming back. We started off with an order of Chicken Wings while we tried to figure out what we wanted on our pizza. My husband suggested we order a few personal sized pizzas so we could enjoy a variety. We ended up trying a Get Meaty, a Salsicca Di Pollo, a Canadian, and of course a cheese pizza. Unfortunately, they were out of their Sicilian Crust; which is the only reason I gave them 4/5 stars. However, our waitress did let us know that thin crust was their specialty. Everything came out nice and hot and DELICIOUS! We actually ended up taking leftovers home which didn't make it through the night :)",

It's a shame because growing up in my father's pizzeria I would expect a family owned monstrosity such as this to be a little bit better.  The calzone came out flat and sliced. I'm not sure which part of Italy these people learned their technique, but you do not slice a calzone, I don't care how big it is. To dumb down the eating experience so that people can have convenient pieces for them to grab and eat is not tha way to serve this dish. The sauce taste like it just came out of the can with no flavoring and or spices whatsoever. Where you would expect a nice gooey pile of stuffing, such as ricotta and cheese and meat and spinach, I actually had to open it up to make sure there was what I ordered was in it.  My wifes butternut cauliflower Pene was tasty  And Citra our server was pleasant, that why it got 2 stars.",

They ordered bone in wings and they really loved them a lot.  I got the pasta Chicago something.  It had a good vodka sauce, bell peppers, sausage and slice of bread.  It was really yummy.  I did not leave any on my plate when I was done.  The overall table experience was excellent.  Everyone loved their food and will be back.  Great job.   If you are looking for a to go cup for water expect a shot glass size cup. LOL  I have the waiter a good hard time about that too.  It looked like a sippy cup too. LOL  Great food and great service.",

I don't know what they put in their pizza sauce but it is AMAZING!!!! The size of the pizza was perfect and the toppings were fresh and delicious. I could eat at Spinato's every night, if I could  Went for happy hour last night and it's my new favorite HH everrrrrrrr!!! Firstly, it's every night of the week, which I love, and secondly, the deals are incredible!Had their $4 Coors light pint special, the HH artichoke crostini, and their $10 pizza special with Sicilian crust, Italian sausage, and garlic, plus a cannoli to-go. SOOOOOOOO delicious and we had really great service at the bar! Will be back soon!",

As soon as we went in you could tell there was an uncomfortable atmosphere to the room. The hostess that seated us had an odd greeting almost like she was checking over her shoulder. The server was really nice but made a mistake on the order which was easily corrected but the \"boss\" brought it to our table. We could tell this was the problem, what a Jerk. As we thanked him, he said well it was her fault and you won't be charged in a gruff tone. We told him it wasn't to get her in trouble but just to get what we ordered. He said well it's her fault for not entering it correctly. Now it was a easily corrected but his attitude ruined our whole experience. Hopefully the server was okay and I asked as we left and she said all was good.",

She was very patient and on top of everything ensuring we had a wonderful experience. The kitchen was amazing as well! When Maddie brought out our pizza she stated the kitchen noticed my half was bubbling a lot and threw a personal pizza in the oven in case I was not happy. I really appreciate that they took the initiative to correct even the smallest detail for us instead of waiting to see if I would notice. I got to take my personal pizza home and had a great date. We ordered the cheesy garlic bread, boneless hot wings, medium pizza half pepperoni and sausage half pesto, basil, and ricotta. Everything was delicious! We will be back for more soon!   Great spot for a date night. Service is always on point. I've been here with my husband a few times and never had a bad experience. We always order the garlic cheesy bread as an appetizer and share a medium sized pizza. Today we ordered half pepperoni with sausage half garlic, basil, and ricotta. The sauce is a bit on the sweet side but it doesn't bother me. The pizza comes on a thin crust which is very tasty. The atmosphere is very welcoming and relaxing. We will definitely keep coming back for our date nights. Thank you to Seth for taking care of us today",

Go with the classic Pepperoni - it really is the best. The crust is thin, sauce is sweet, and has a prefect balance of cheese and meat. We have had a bunch of the other pizzas as well but this one really is the best. If you aren't in the mood for something basic, try Mama's Award Winning Other Signature, The Spicy Italian, or Nicole's New Favorite. Still can't decide? Get half one pizza, half of another. So good.  Happy hour is 2-6pm - not only are there drink specials but the food specials are good too. Get the Meatball Trio (with marinara). OMG so good!!",

This location gives me that old school pizzeria vibe. The service was great and the prices are competitive. My favorite are the Spicy Italian (it's not overwhelmingly spicy) and The Chicago. The quality of their pizza is top notch, from the dough to the sauce (best sauce ever) and the toppings. We ordered the chicken wings and did not expect it to be great. We were pleasantly surprised at how good they were. With our party of 6, we were torn between which one we enjoyed more: the medium wings or the golden bbq. My boyfriend always gets the calzone which he loves. I have yet to try their pasta dishes.   Spinato's is an Arizona staple. No doubt, they serve one of the best pizzas in the valley.",

Nick went out of his way to make sure me and my mother were ok and kept our glasses filled and made sure our food was brought to us promptly. It is rare nowadays to have your waiter go above and beyond and give exceptional guest service. My mother and I had a wonderful meal. The calzones were brought out hot and tasted absolutely delicious! I would request to be seated in Nick's section as his service was excellent.",

The pear and gorgonzola salad I got was really nice, I think it would've been perfect with the addition of some beets!  The only reason I give this place 3 stars and not 2 is because I liked the salad.  On the downside, the pizza wasn't great.  And for a place that is a pizzeria, that's pretty important.  The crust was thinner than I expected and didn't have a particularly nice texture.  It kind of felt like the crust on frozen pizzas.  Also the sauce was WAYYY too sweet.  Don't trust the reviewer who said the sauce is \"slightly\" sweet, it's SUPER sweet.  So much so that I wanted to eat more of my pizza, but also felt sick at the thought of trying to eat any more.",

    "text": "I went to Spinato's for the first time with some friends from work who had all been there before and swore by their pizza.  Decided to give it a go and see what all the fuss was about their pizza.  First off the new building they are in is really really nice.  nice and open with skylights galore giving a nice day time feel inside and extremely open.  We ended up splitting a large peperoni and sausage thin crust with a side Cesar.  The pizza came out and it looked awesome.  slightly greasy but being a professional fat guy I tend to get over something like that quite easily.  Their sauce has a great sweet quality about it and the thin crust wasn't too thin but there wasn't a lot of crunch to it which i'm ok with.  I know some thin crust purists would frown upon this but I don't care about them, this is my review!  all in all it was some damn fine pizza and I will for sure be back to here and try out a few other items on their menu.",

I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich for lunch. It come with potato chips for $10. Mtn Dew was $2.80. After a $2 tip my check was over $14. So while it is a little pricey, it was definitely worth it.  The sandwich was great with each half weighing about 1lb each with a lot of meat. They also had a perfect amount of sauce and mozzarella cheese. It also comes with a side of good potato chips.  Usually these sandwiches are too dry or just lacking flavor. This one was neither. I would order it again in a heartbeat. Everyone else's food also looked great.",

The pizza doesn't skimp on the toppings, the sauce is nicely savory, and the crust is neither too thick nor too thin. For flavor combos, I particularly recommend the Chicago for those who eat meat and the signature fresh spinach for the vegetarians. Oh, and if you're feeling indulgent start with the spaghetti calzone. Carbs on carbs doesn't always work, but here it feels entirely appropriate.",

I ordered mine with lemon and had to ask twice for the lemon and it took a long time to get it even after the 2nd time. My husbands water was empty before she came back to take our order and she never re-filled it. I had to go to the bar and ask the bartender to fill it. 25 minutes into the visit and the waitress informs us that she forgot to put our order in. She apologized so I forgave. About 5 min later she brought out some cheesy garlic bread. My husband and I weren't sure but thought that maybe she was just trying to repair some damage with a nice gesture. I had ordered a side Greek salad and a personal margarita pizza and my hubby ordered a small get meaty pizza. At the 40 minute mark anther server brought out a large sausage and pepperoni pizza to outer table. They were not at all busy and there were no guests that came in after us. There were only 3 tables including ours in the section where we sat.  When I told the server that the pizza wasn't ours she was very confused. I just told her we are gonna go ahead and leave.",

Once we received our bill it appeared both entrees were mispriced.  We asked our server and she asked the manager.  Turns out my sandwich did not include cheese which was extra even though it was not presented this way and the menu makes no mention of it.  It also does not show as an add on the receipt.  Also turns out our server rang up a different but very similar pasta dish than what my wife ordered.  We got sorry both mistakes were my fault from the server and sorry the menu is confusing from the manager but no offer to take responsibility for it.  They basically said we screwed up but you are still paying for our mistakes.  Left a very bad taste for both my wife and I.  We eat out a lot and there are far too many good places to eat in Phoenix than to eat at one that is at best poorly trained and presented and at worst misleading and still refuses responsibility when they admit they have done wrong.  For $2, they have lost two customers for life.  Having now read a number of comments on Yelp, it appears there are more issues like this than you would expect and their misleading and aggressive pricing is a pattern.  If you do choose to eat here, be extra diligent about what you are ordering and ask if anything you have ordered is extra.",

    "text": "This location is certainly a step above their old location on Glendale. I went here with a large party (about 10 people) and they were very accommodating. They had a table ready for us on a Thurs night in about 10 minutes. In the meantime, the husband and I checked out their (very large) bar. He had a snakebite, which was prepared incorrectly (the cider and porter were mixed together instead of layered, but at least it was reasonably priced at 5$), I had the Shandy, which was unusually made with porter and lemonade (most shandys I have tried are with a lighter beer). I really enjoyed my drink! I felt like the lemonade lightened the otherwise heavy porter. Anyway, the service was good for our large party and the food didn't take too long to come out. We had several pizzas, a spaghetti and meatballs, a couple small calzones, wings, cheesy bread, and a couple salads. The sweet chili wings were maybe the best item... just enough heat and falling off the bone... really good wings. The cheese bread was good, but come on, it's melted cheese on bread (can't really be bad). The meatballs were good, but could have had a bit more sauce. The caesar salad was a little too fishy tasting, but their italian dressing was good. I had the 'mama's special' personal calzone add basil and ricotta. This thing was very tasty with garlic, tomato, and spinach.... and at just over 5$, it was a great price for the amount of food you get (fairly large). I would come back to this location!",

So, if a somewhat sweet tomato sauce isn't your thang stay away from Spinato's.  However, it doesn't bother me, and I did love the meat pizza and the spinach one.  Which one was best would be like Sophie's Choice for me as I loved them both. This location is very pretty compared to the other, but both are good.  I like Spinato's myself.  Good service, decent pizza. AND the server even asked us what type of crust we liked, so you can get thick crust or thin or medium--whatever--which I never had before.   We had a Black guy who said he was an ex-Marine, but I didn't catch his name (Brandon? Bradley?), but he was excellent so the group tipped super well to him. It was a gooooooo, and now I'm even fatter than I was this morning...LOL!  And I ate it all without a care about even one calorie...yeah, that good!",

    "text": "I've had Spinato's pizza numerous times and each time it is great. This time was not any different. The trio of meatballs was delicious and great amount of ooey melty cheese. Their pizzas are always great!  The reason for my rating only being 3 stars during this particular visit is for the service. We got to the restaurant around 5:30 p.m. on a Sunday and the place had only a handful of people, but we still waiting about 15 minutes. Maybe they were getting ready for the dinner rush, so it wasn't that big of a deal. Once we finally got seated our waiter greeted us and took drink orders right away. After bringing our drinks we put in our order for appetizers and salads while we still made decisions on the types of pizzas we wanted. As we sat there waiting for our appetizers, the restaurant slowly started filling up. The waiter would constantly walk past us to greet and take orders from his other tables, so it was difficult to get his attention to place our pizza orders. When we finally got our appetizers and salads, the waiter was nowhere really to be found. We started eating the salads and appetizers, but slowly since we hadn't even had a chance to place our pizza orders and we knew that would take awhile. The waiter finally came by to take the pizza orders about 10-15 minutes after we had gotten our appetizers and salads. I've never been to a restaurant that took quite this long to place main entree orders.  We ordered two kids pizzas, two medium pizzas, and two small pizzas for our group of 6. We knew the food would take some time since it was quite a bit of food and the restaurant was filling up for the dinner rush. About 20 minutes later all the pizzas came out. They had messed up on the kids pizzas, so they brought out extras which was very nice of them. Again, we didn't see our waiter  for a little bit after our pizzas had arrived, so we had to ask another staff member for plates. Like I said in the beginning, the food was great!  We saved some room for dessert, so once the waiter came back we ordered some gelato and a cannoli. The first set of desserts (one cannoli, one chocolate gelato, and one pistachio gelato) came out, without any utensils and one of the gelatos was in a weird clear bowl. I didn't think too much of it since the chocolate gelato came with the kids menu, so I thought that's why it came in the nice white dish. However, once the second set of desserts came out (one chocolate gelato, one pistachio gelato, one raspberry gelato) all in the same nice white dish I found it even more odd that the other pistachio was in a clear dish. The dish was clean, so we let it slide. When the second set of desserts came out, they all came with spoons and ready to go so the other half of our party was able to eat them right away. As for the other half (first set of desserts), we had to look around and wait for our waiter or another staff member for spoons. We finally got the attention of another staff member who brought us out spoons. As soon as she brought those spoons out our waiter showed up.   To recap: The food was great. I liked everything that we had to eat. It was really the service, inconsistencies, and wait time that was lacking.   I've waitressed before so I know first hand that when it gets busy it is difficult to give every table 100% of your time and attention. I don't expect that of any wait staff, but I would appreciate a check in every once in awhile. Especially, when we hadn't placed food orders yet and you're really focusing only on one or two of your tables. I watched a couple of other tables become a little irritated in waiting for the same waiter.",

Can without a doubt say I had an amazing experience! The pizza was to die for! The service exceeded my expectations! I learned a lot about the Spinato family and how it all got started. I also really liked the idea that it is still a family restaurant and they have decided to not join the corporate way. Loved Spinato's so much that I applied for a job!",

    "text": "We'd been getting takeout pizzas from the Glendale location for a long time...the pizzas were great and service was always fantastic.  But we won't go into this location anymore.  I'm with other reviewers...the service is hands-down bad.  I'd been in a couple of times just after it opened, and the main dining room is really loud.  Knowing that my hard-of-hearing husband (who wasn't with me either time) would have a hard time, I asked about seating in the much quieter bar and was told twice that it was open seating.  So when I finally came in with my husband, there were two parties waiting, so I confirmed with the hostess stand that the bar was open seating and we sat down at a table.   After a couple of minutes, a young woman came over and asked if we checked with the hostess stand and I assured her that we did.  She then told us that we couldn't sit there, and I explained that we were told that it was open seating in the bar and it's much quieter and easier for my husband to hear in the bar.  Most bars have open seating, so I was a I little surprised when she snapped that it was open seating AT the bar, not IN the bar.  (I'm not sure how I missed the preposition three different times, but it's possible that I did.)  We got up to move, but even though there were several open tables around us and several in the dining room, she made no effort to apologize or to re-seat us.  The most appropriate response would have been:  \"I'm sorry, this table isn't available, but stay here and let me find an open table for you.\"  When that wasn't forthcoming, I said to my husband \"well, let's just go somewhere else.\"  At this point, she still could've saved the day, but she said the two words a customer never wants to hear at this point:  \"Oh, OK.\"  She clearly suffered from a lack of training, a lack of maturity, or a lack of experience (or all three)...and a boatload of apathy.    Needless to say, we haven't been back (this was 6 months ago)...which is too bad because we live within walking distance and figured we'd visit often.  Fortunately, it's not the only good pizza place in the area...",

My friend and I went to the bar to get appetizers while the group waited outside. The bar atmosphere was good and we got served right away. When our group finally got seated it still took a while before we got the food that we ordered. The food was good as I had expected, having dined in the Tempe location and in this establishment's former Phoenix location.

I was dying for a GOOD pizza (I'm from NY, and was living in south Texas at the time--not a \"real\" pizza to be found in south Texas anywhere!) and I was not disappointed. Since my first visit, I've moved to Phoenix and have been back many times to this and other Spinato's locations with friends.  I love the atmosphere of this location, and the servers have always been super friendly, prompt, and personable. The food has always been delicious--I'm a fan of the stuffed mushrooms and the Get Meaty or Chicago pizza. The roasted fennel and italian sausage pizza is definitely my favorite, though. Honestly, I don't think you can really go wrong.  I also love the friendliness of the service here, as I mentioned earlier. The first time I visited, I was with a friend who had never had a cannoli before. We mentioned this jokingly to our server, and she told us she'd bring us one on the house--so nice of her! They ended up running out of the filling for it before we got our dessert, though, and instead, she brought us a tortine (their version of a ding dong). It was a really nice gesture and definitely made us want to keep coming back!",

It looked half the size from what we remember and completely deflated. I ordered my once favorite sausage/mushroom pizza, and it hardly tasted like what I remember. Most notably, the cheese. It was no more the delicious, thick, stringy mozzarella. It's very sad when pizzerias begin to cut corners, especiially with the cheese quality.",

    "text": "I have been to Spinato's quite a few times.  The most recent was ordering take out pizza a few days ago.  I ordered a large pizza with Canadian bacon and pepperoni plus a side salad.  The small side salad was $3.50 for basically a small amount of lettuce but the pizza is so amazing that I won't even complain about the lame salad.  The pizza sauce is like no other. It is sweet and wonderful and I crave it. I even love how they cut the pizza into squares.  For some reason the squares make it even more appetizing.  The pizza is so rich and filling and I want to keep eating it just to taste the amazing sauce but I get too full, so I save it for the next day and it still tastes good. I forgot to say that I love the Spinato's balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing. I even went to buy it at Sprouts so I could use it at home. I would highly recommend this place.   It's one of my all time faves.",

Went to go pick it up and they informed me that they ran out of thick crust and someone should have called me. Unfortunately no one did so I took the thin crust one home, a little grumpy. Instead of running onto yelp or social media, I gave them a chance to fix it! I feel no one does this anymore and just runs and complains. I emailed them personally, explained the situation just to bring it to their attention. Wasn't expecting anything more.   The sweetest manager reached out to me personally, apologized deeply and credited my account for another pie on the house.   So tonight, I went and picked up my thick crust pizza on the house and it was amazing as always.   I appreciate the company reaching out and fixing a small issue to a loyal customer.",

My favorite two pizzas are the pesto presto (great for those who don't eat pork but still want some meat) and da Greek. When I cannot decide between the two, I ask for half and half. I will warn that Spinato's does get busy so expect about 20-45 minutes for a pizza to come out to your table, but it's worth the wait. On date nights, the side salad is large enough for 2 to split while you wait for your pizza.",

We were in a group of four & started off with 3 appetizers: Garlic Bread, Baked Artichoke Crostini & Stuffed Mushrooms. All were surprisingly delicious! You would kind of expect at least one thing to be average, but nope! I would go back just for the crostini & the mushrooms alone!! Now, I know they're a pizzeria but I was really craving just a classic pasta. So I went with the \"Create Your Own\" option & chose spaghetti, with marinara + meatballs. Like I said, it was exactly what I hoped! The sauce is tasty & they didn't skimp! I'm not normally a huge meat eater, but every so often the perfect meatball sounds like life, & these were! They were flavorful, tender, the kind you could eat without any sauce & they would still be great! Oh, & our waitress simply added to the nice experience! She was personable & pleasant! I know there's always a ton of other places to try, but I'm looking forward to coming back here!",

We had heard how wonderful this place was, how we just had to try it, how it has some of the best pizza in phx.  I can say without a single doubt that it was possibly the most horrible pizza I have ever put in my mouth.  The Service was ok, the restaurant was clean, and bright, atmosphere was good.  The Pizza itself was beautiful, visually the pizza made you want to eat the whole thing.  However, the first thing you taste when you put a piece of their pizza in your mouth is SUGAR.  Now I know people may like that, but I don't, pizza should not be sweet and this pizza, all three of them tasted like used a 25lb bag of sugar to make each one.    We usually try a place at least twice before saying never again... but given how horrible all three pizzas were, there is no way we will ever step foot back in Spinato's.",

However, the manager at the Phoenix location was very rude to me a month ago. I had called in to place an order and my previous order before that the Tiramisu was missing from the order after I got back to the office. Not a big deal but I expected that their customer service would be top notch and that they would accommodate and would have no issues giving me one with my next order. Nope! The manager said without a receipt he was not going to give me one on the house! Plus he quickly rushed me off the phone and was short! This was at the Phoenix location. I have never had any issues at the Tempe location. Management at this location has always been very easy to deal with. I am not one to complain first off but come on when a dessert is missing from the order just satisfy the customer and replace it! No need to require the receipt I find this ridiculous! I could see if more than one tiramisu was ordered than that is a different story and a receipt should be required. I only gave 4 stars because of the poor customer service & rudeness by management at the Phoenix location.",

No issues with the garlic bread or dinner salad (good food and lovely pomegranate balsamic dressing).  Then my friends sausage Florentine comes out but no food for me . However, our awesome server Jennifer was quick to follow the food runner and explain that the kitchen lost the ticket for my food.  Sounds bad...but she nicely recovers by offering to have my friends food made again to come out with my calzone and leaves the one he has now for us to nibble on while we wait. Manager Jenell comes by to apologize and offer dessert as well. Both the Florentine and my steak calzone were fantastic, FYI.  Accidents happen anywhere, it's genuinely all about 3 things for me: communication (keeping me updated on what is happening), contrition (genuine apologies from both the manager and the server) and restitution. Above and beyond scores on all three of these for Team J&J!   Conclusion: I'll be back",

But everything about it is exactly right--especially if you ask for an extra crispy bottom.  One thing unique about their pizza is their sauce. It's got some sweetness to it--nothing overpowering, just an undertone, but I think some people might not like it. Some other things to try are the meatball appetizer, the Greek salad, and the spaghetti calzone.   Note that there are several Spinattos locations and they are not created equally. The one in Tempe is really small with only a handful of tables. The one on Bell is the best:  plenty of tables, including a great patio, friendly staff, and consistent food you can count on. This Phoenix location on 7th is huge but it's really missing the \"family pizzeria\" feel--it actually feels more like a Macaroni Grill--and who strives for that?  Also the main dining room has terrible acoustics and is really loud when it is crowded.",

We had been ordering from NYPD for years because we like thin crust. Overall the sausage was tasty. The sauce was light. The cheese was really good. They delivered in a timely friendly manner. Will go there again. Next time I will dine in. It looked nice inside when I peeked in once.",

I had a personal size thin crust with sausage and pineapple which was pretty decent.  My wife had the Italian sausage Florentine with a garlic Alfredo sauce which was quite tasty.  It was still during 'Happy Hour' so I had a glass of the House red wine (a red blend of Northern AZ).  Nice blend of grapes, tannins and a great finish.  Jean ordered a Margarita but had to send it back as she did not care for the flavor at all.  I took a sip and agreed with her.  Not attractive at all.  We had a bit of a wait (about 30 minutes) but not too bad for a Sat night.  Seems they may have been a bit short handed as there was a company Christmas party going on just as we arrived.  So I can only surmise that added to the slow service as well.  All in all, it was a pretty decent experience.",

But if you plan on needing ketchup - like my son when ordering chicken tenders from the kid's menu - you need to bring your own. They didn't have any ketchup at the restaurant so I went across the parking lot to Basha's to buy some Heinz. It was a bummer that I got caught in line behind a guy who wasn't familiar with using his debit card so the process took a while before I returned to my family to finish our meal. 4 stars for a restaurant that doesn't have ketchup when they offer a kid's menu. Clearly this condiment continues its decline in American culture.",

They offered another, but by that point, I wasn't about to waste more time waiting. I finally had enough today and asked for a refund. It was granted, but you can bet I won't be back and will tell all my friends to spend their money elsewhere. Even Domino's gives a crap about their customers.",

We sat at the bar and started to order a couple classes of wine from the bar tender Edward but they had just texted us for our table.  There was only a 5 minute wait, awesome! We were seated in the bar, where there were no children, awesome! We each had a pasta dish Chicago Penne Alla Vodka and Rosted Butternut squash & Brussels sprout penne, with cheesy garlic bread.  Glasses of wine for $5, awesome! Christopher ordered the tempting Red Velvet Ding Dong, it is exactly what you think. It is a square, not round, Red Velvet cake dipped in dark chocolate.  Holy crap it was good. I for one do not order dessert at restaurants unless they appear exception to me. I am often disappointed.  In this case my compliments to the pastry Chef, this cake was super moist and tasty without being too sweet.  I ordered the Trios Cabernet Sauvignon, which was super tasty.  Pops had the Chianti. The service was great and we simply enjoyed a great meal. As a bit of recommendation, if you have not eaten at Spinato's before you must give it a try. The sauce is has great flavor, the Pizzas are great and so is the pasta. If you have not been to the original locale in Tempe you should see where it all started. It is in an industrial area and they do not serve alcohol at this location. It opened in 1986. The Central or North Central Phoenix location opened in 1994, has since moved from the well know 12th St and Glendale location to the new building built where Manuel's Mexican food once stood, at the corner of 7th St. & Missouri. It is in my opinion a far better location. The new building is beautiful. It has increased the size of the restaurant and the parking is much better.  However, I do like the intimacy of the old location. As a local, it made me feel like it was my restaurant and not just another commercial space.  Spinato's has great pizza, pasta, salads, and appetizers. They still serve up authentic Chicago style Italian food even though they have been making pizza in the valley since 1974.",

And I never would have realized how bad Spinato's pizza tastes when it arrives so off temperature.   The next day I went down to Bashas next door for some groceries and stopped in to Spinato's to mention how bad my delivery pizza tasted. The manager was very defensive. Refused to apologize or admit anything could have been wrong with it. As I was leaving with my groceries in hand, the manager walked outside with me. I think to profile me socio-economically based on my car. I'm never ordering pizza here again. It was really bad and the management didn't care.",

Only a few people eating.  I know this is a time for the place to recover from the lunch rush but I feel it is a good time to see if they have really good service.  If they can still provide great service while doing their tasks then they have done it!  This place failed horribly.  Our waitress was very friendly...when she acutally was around.  Next, DO NOT ORDER A PITCHER OF DRINKS! Our waitress told us it would be enough for 4 people.  There were three of us so we thought it would be a good deal... it was $24 and we got two and half drinks out of it.  We problably should have complained about it.

    "text": "Spinato's is my favorite pizza place in all of Phoenix.  The pizza is simply incredible!  The customer service is great too.  For example, for my birthday I had a party and invited some friends.  My birthday is July 5th, and Independence day was on Friday.  I had spoken to the manager previously, and she said that because I was ordering a number of pizzas that I should order them a day ahead of time.  I tried to call on July 4th, but the restaurant was closed.  I was in a bit of a panic, as I had already hyped up the pizza to my guests.  On the morning of my birthday, I went to the restaurant itself.  I knocked on the door a full half-hour before the restaurant was set to open.  I talked to a wonderful employee by the name of Gabby and explained the situation.  She let me in and took the order and promised that the pizzas would be delivered by 5:00 p.m.  There was not one hint of irritation, and I never felt like I was being a bother (although I probably was).  I went away feeling like my birthday had been saved.  At 5:00 almost to the minute, the pizzas arrived.  The delivery person was polite and friendly, and my guests loved the pizza.  I can't say enough great things about this place.  I highly recommend it.  I'm not sure what's going on with other reviews on here that say the service is horrible because I certainly didn't see that, and I never have any time I've been there.",

    "text": "First time - one of my sisters suggested our family meet here for lunch as it accomadte our group of 9 and it is kid friendly.  We got there right at 12pm today - on a Sunday so there was no wait, the place was clean, and had a good vibe.  I ordered a Bloddy Mary - good presentation, but there seemed to be no alcohol in it, and it tasted like tomato juice.  I let the server know, and asked her to correct it.  She let me know that there may be a change to add alcohol. I told her if they feel that is fair, than I am ok with that - their call.  She came back with the same drink, unchanged, explaining that the lack of vodka taste was siracha vodka.  I just sent it back -  it was a special occasion so I thought I would treat myself, now it's not worth it.  Moving on -   The server was nice, but slow. I had to ask her name / no name tag, or introduction.  I had to ask for refills (empty for OVER 10 mins), wrong size calzone was brought out (they did make that right) and they never brought the chicken wings, so we reminded them and canceled.. The food was OK, but I doubt I will return. There are many other places around here with better customer service that I will go to.",

    "text": "I went to Spinato's to pick up a couple of their delicious pizzas for carry-out. As I waited I decided to go over to the bar. The bartender was less than friendly--he did not make eye contact, he did not speak in complete sentences. It was as if my presence at his bar disturbed him.  After wiping the bar down in front of me with a filthy cloth, he placed some menus on the wet surface, and I told him I did not need I menu. He left me and returned to his register without giving me the opportunity to tell him what I wanted to drink. I only wanted a beer, and I was sitting right next to the tap. Shortly after he returned to his register,  a couple came in and took their seats right next to the register, and they received their drinks within a matter of seconds. I hate to pull a certain card, but it is the only thing that I can think of as to why the service I was provided was subpar. Spinato's, please train your people how to be courteous to all. I will avoid the bar and maybe even the food from this day forward.",

    "text": "First, I must say I LOVE Spinato's!  My family has been going here for years and will continue to do so.  But, I am giving the new Spinato's on 7th St only 4 stars for a few reasons:  1.  The bar and patio are great but, the dining area lacks the charm of the old Spinato's. I feel it looks similar to seating in a Denny's or cafeteria-style restaurant, not cozy, no charm! 2.  The new bread on the DaVinci is not as good. It's on too much bread and the bread is harder, which makes the sandwich difficult to eat. I now ask for it to be lightly toasted so the bread isn't too hard.  3.  I picked up a pizza last night and asked for 2 ranch dressings. I was charged $1.01 and received 2 tiny containers, each about 1/2 full with approx. 3/4 of a tablespoon of ranch.... Really?!?!  I found this to be grossly overcharging and disappointing and told the waiter my feelings. If you are going to charge for ranch, at least fill the tiny containers.  4.  I miss to-go cups!  I get food to go a lot and would love to get an ice tea or Pepsi with your fabulous pellet ice to enjoy with my meal.   These things excluded, I would give Spinato's 5 stars!  The Mama's Spinach and Super Six pizzas are my favorites, the spaghetti, meatball and ricotta calzone is a yummy masterpiece, the antipasti salad with their house Italian is a perfect starter and I LOVE the pellet ice (although you must request it if you are at the bar).  If you go at peak times, prepare to wait but, it will be worth it!",

    "text": "My GF and I had an early dinner this evening! As expected the cocktails were good, food was mediocre but the service was disappointing. I worked in the business for many years and as a server I welcomed having people to serve. After all, isn't that's what I was hired for? It astounds me when we are treated as an intrusion versus a source of revenue to the business. This evening after ordering and served cocktails we were treated like we had some sort of contagious disease. The food was brought by another server. Our server did not ask us how our food was even though she checked on the table next to us 2-3 times without even once asking us how our meal was. Did not even glance at our table as she walked by us numerous times. Sneaky suspicion we were sitting at a table for four versus the two of us and she was upset she was not getting that early evening dinner rush. Felt like we were being ignored so we could leave and she can get four people at the table. Pretty damn rude! Well, needless to say, last time spending my hard earned money there. Plenty of other Italian places around with better food and after this place, much better service! At least I know my business will be appreciated.",
