The tall, short blond haired male bartender became upset when I gave him a 30% tip and wrote on the credit card slip that the bar top was sticky and it wasn't up to standard. He sent a bar back out side where I was smoking on the patio to chastise me about my note.  I came back after the renovations and found the same bar tender serving me again. I had two beers(draft) and two shots of liquor as well as two appetizers .  After he admitted to over serving me, which in Arizona can result in a fine for the establishment. I subsequently left. Won't spend another dime in this establishment.",

I came here last Friday for a Yelper UYE to watch the Kitchen Nightmares Finale.   I hate to complain because I wasn't the organizer of the event, but a reservation was made for a group of folks to come out and watch the season finale of a TV show.  One would think that the room that was reserved would have a door, that could be closed, to quiet the noise of the restaurant so that the group could do what it came to do to, watch AND LISTEN to the TV program.  Unfortunately, our group could barely here the television because the \"room\" (actually a 3-sided space) we were in was separated from the rest of the restaurant by a partition that didn't close off the entire walkway into the cubby-hole-like space.  I don't think any of the fellow Yelpers at that table were happy with the space.    I ordered the calamari and it was a downer for me, a never repeat again'er.  I was so hungry after not eating all day that  I ate that calamari and the entire time, I wondered why did I order THAT dish!   the only upside and bright spot was my cocktail.  I think it was called a dirty blue martini.  That  thing was delicious.  Would I go back here, only if someone else is organizing something at this location and I had no say or influence in moving the venue.  UPDATE: Their management told me that in the future they will no longer reserve that space for people interested in watching and hearing a TV program.  It might be ok for a sports show though, but not for what we were there for.  They have a different space that is quieter and more appropriate for watching a TV program.  That room was booked before the UYE was booked.  Hats of to their management for reaching out to me.",

Meaty, crispy, the sauces were delicious. We also got a small cheese thin-crust pizza, which I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  The drinks were strong and tasty, and I honestly didn't mind paying full-price once we decided to continue on after happy hour ended. I recommend the Chicago Bull if you're a fan of ginger anything, like me.  I would say if you're not there on happy hour the food/drink might be a little on the pricey side, but the quality speaks for itself overall.   Can't review the waitresses since we sat at the bar, but were I attracted to the ladies, the verdict would be \"Schwing!\"    The bartenders were quick, super attentive and accommodating. I'm normally one to just kind of let them work but they were all very friendly and sociable in a genuine way. They were waiting on us, not working us for a tip. Refreshing!  Shout out to Autumn and especially Dan for taking care of us drunken brauds on a Friday night. Thank you. :)",

    "text": "I already don't like football that much, but I like bar food and drinks.  My boyfriend is a fan of a certain Midwestern team that is often not shown in bars around here. We called ahead and they said yes, come on down, we are playing it.  Once we arrived we asked to sit in that section.  The television they played it on was on the wall of the long booth near the bar, sort of a weird angle to try to watch it.  With craned necks, we asked if they would consider switching us to an area in their mostly empty restaurant to be more comfortable.  We were told no.  We ordered some food, and it was very low quality.  With such a great location and less than 10 feet away from a Whole Foods, how can an establishment serve such a  mediocre burger and mushy chicken wings?  Next, I'd like to address the soda gun on the bar that is available for the waitresses to use.  It is not attached to a holder.  It is used and placed on the bar counter where the bartender passes the drinks.  I saw the soda gun used for multiple refills and get knocked into the trashcan below.  The waitresses would retrieve it and replace it on the bar without even a swipe of the sanitizer towel.  I would only recommend to order bottled beer as it is the safest item to consume here. By the way, everything is sticky.",

The highlights were their appetizers: I didn't verify with our server, but they all tasted like they were made in-house. The apps didn't taste like the typical frozen-from-a-bag fair that you get at a lot of sports bars. The breading was too high quality for that.  The fried zucchini was phenomenal. The boneless chicken wings were good (with a variety of sauces); ours didn't come out very speedily or warm though. The staff was friendly, but it was hard to get service; they'd just disappear for large chunks of time. The ambiance is nice. But, I wish they had more local beers on tap. [*It still puzzles me why EVERY bar in Phoenix doesn't carry the Gold Medal winning Hop Knot IPA from Four Peaks. It's local and one of the best IPAs in the world.]",

    "text": "I hate YELP so the fact I am leaving a review on this extortion based site says a lot but Valerie the bartender deserves it.  So yes YELP extorts business owners to keep the negative reviews from either showing up, and if the business owner doesn't pay YELP for monthly for marketing services positive ones never show. I wouldn't have posted this but too many good businesses get screwed because of their business practices. Now I would go into detail about this but this review is about Valerie not Yelp so Google \"Yelp unfair filtering process\" , \"Yelp extortion\" or better yet \"Yelp loses in court\" to find out more.   Okay now back to Valerie. I am leaving this review based solely on the staffing. The management here must have made a significant investment in the interior and the staffing because it seems slow when I come in, yet it's always chic and has more than ample servers to take care of the customer; that shows they care about the customer experience. Here's what impressed me about Valerie, no matter if you order a coke like I do or a beer, she gives you consistent service.   I am a former New Orleans Bourbon Street bartender and restaurant GM, with over 20 years of experience in the industry, and usually two-three refills is all you get if you sit at my bar, not because I want to give you bad service but I am thinking to myself, \" Who really want five cokes in one sitting?\" No, Valerie refills drinks like they are all Blue Moons! She is friendly, can strike up a conversation, and keeps your area clean.  Kudos to Val and the staff, even though Yelp sucks!",

The food is \"as good as the chef can do\"!  The menu says they have award winning wings- ok sure whatever you say.  Was there anyone else competing against you? I guarantee zipps or hazelwoods or anywhere with a fryer wasn't involved on this hokie competition. They were worse than pizza huts wings or the ones you buy frozen at costco and bake yourself.  I had the spicy bone in. I ordered the full pound and the visual of the tiny skimpy wings in the basket made me wonder the whole time if I was mistakenly given the half pound order.   In summary- great bar to watch Chicago sports but eat before or after elsewhere. This experience made me realize that continuing to always look for a better neighborhood sports bar than zipps is a waste of time.    This bar should be embarrassed by the food. Our group felt the chi fries, pretzel dip app, Italian sandwich and buffalo chicken dip were all marginal and forgettable. The personal pizza was a piece of cardboard with sauce and cheese.  No one felt ordering something we had was worth trying again at anytime in the future.   I will give them a tiny bit of mercy as this was a HUGE  game and the place was full but the FOOD was not memorable in any way.",

    "text": "So as my first time here at the bar I heard somewhat good and bad reviews from friends so I decided to go check this place out. I was taking a look at the menu and I realized there are some options for bone-in and boneless wings with a few different varieties on sauces. I asked the waitress the differences between traditional and grilled for each of the wings and asked for a recommendation for sauces which she said the \"sweet chili\". I told her that I will order 12 wings, 6 of them being boneless and 6 being bone-in which I am pretty sure she either wrote down and took notes. Later I received the wings burnt and pretty much uneatable with all the wings being bone-in. I asked her what happened to the half and half she responded with \"you can't mix the bone-in and boneless together\". If I was told that from before I would have changed my order and the fact you brought something else kinda just told me she really didn't care much. At least what she could have done was re-make the order or tell me in advance that I couldn't have order the way I did. So thank you, Half Moon for the burnt and tasteless wings. Literally, this place puts McDonald's as a 5-star company which the employees wouldn't even get the orders wrong.   Try avoiding this place by all means.",

The place is fun, the girls wear short skirts and knee socks. They have a full list of local beers in bottles and on draft. They boast a monthly special, which July's is a burger for 1/2 price if you buy a drink. That's almost $4.50 for a giant burger with fries. Unfortunately I was full from lunch and did some light snacking with my beer drinking.   First up, I wanted the Watermelon Wheat - Perfect for any hot Arizona day (which is most of them) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#MrdXI7O_NSKVvqgGTcIYOA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9B...</a>  Then, the Dirty Guera Blonde Ale, because I love blonde ales and cute names. It was great and encouraged us to visit Nimbus the next day! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#5nzmTTMOmGj_sVIxkTM51Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9B...</a>  In between, we ordered a couple appetizers, a gigantic pretzel that was served with both queso and mustard. I love to dipp! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#lMQuuVAuKQAL-RKfEYkPWg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9B...</a> And my guy ordered the Prime Rib Sliders (4) served with carmalized onions, french dip sauce and horseradish. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#seP7cR-l6f3xjnJtzFQIxA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9B...</a> That was a meal in itself, really.   For Dessert, I ordered the White Chocolate Ale which was by far the most dessert tasting beers I have ever tried. It was so much like a sweet white chcolate, you really need to savor every sip. If you see this anywhere, order it and thank me later. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#1jzaMBgdEa9YyVasa8rukQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9B...</a>  After all that, I needed a couple sugar free Red Bulls to snap myself back in action. We had a fight to watch and I was not going to be the first to TAP OUT.",

The alumni also mentioned how pleased they were we the chosen venue. An extra added bonus for us; we didn't have to pay for a room charge, this helped tremendously as our budget was tight when we began our planning for the reunion.

Warm soft buttery pretzels & beer cheese. This time the beer cheese was good, but a little soupy. The last time it was thick & creamy. On Tuesdays they have wings .50 wings from 7 pm - 10 pm. They tasted yummy & were cooked properly. A lot better then our last visit. But now chose not to add celery & carrots :-( Staff was nice, as they changed the televisions to our requested MLB games. Service was sufficient. :-)",

Watched the warriors game, in a corner.  Supposedly people come here for the waitresses, according to yelp or tripadvisor or something, possibly to look at, but definitely not for their personality or service.  Food was fine, service was fairly slow, tap list was boring. Wish it was busier, maybe it was the time of year, maybe this place isn't that popular.  Too many other sports bars in the area, probably wouldn't visit again.",

    "text": "Three stars is pretty spot on.  I actually was going to give this place two stars, but they got a bump for friendly service.  I came here after work for happy hour with some co-workers and their significant others.  While the waitresses were attentive and friendly, the food and the sports setup were unimpressive.  The restaurant is squished in between an office and hotel complex just southeast of the Camelback Colonnade.  There's a decent amount of parking, though finding it was initially confusing as its mixed with reserved office parking.  Inside, its a pretty standard sports bar, though perhaps going for a modern edgy look.  The TVs around the bar and restaurant area are actually not as big as you'd find at some other sports bars like Zipps.  I also noticed they had issues with the satellite feed for some of the games they were showing on their televisions.  Some of the TV screens just froze or went black numerous times.  Alright, to the grub.  Its a Chicago sports bar and proudly displays a Bears flag outside so a lot of the menu is geared towards Chicago fare.  Fair enough.  I love a good italian beef sandwich and some italian sausage, so I went for the combo sandwich.  I've had a sandwich like this before at other Chicago themed restaurants in the Phoenix area and I know to expect a little bit of a peppery kick, but this place took it WAY too far.  The size of the sandwich was okay (though in my opinion a bit small for the $10 I paid), but the proportion of peppers to meat was probably 2/3rd peppers, 1/3rd meat.  I really couldn't even taste the meat as I could only taste a fiery painful burn.  I can handle spicy to a point, but eventually you reach a pain threshold that prevents you from enjoying the meal.  The overabundance of peppers ruined the dish.  On the good side, I was very pleasantly surprised to find Lumberyard Red on their beer menu and the fact that it was discounted for happy hour.  And as mentioned before, our waitress was excellent.  She refilled my glass right on cue and was equally attentive with my friends.  Perhaps they'll step up their game for the NFL regular season.  Its a Bears bar so they'll have plenty of Chicago patrons come kickoff.  I don't expect out of this world food at a sports bar, but I would hope it would be adequate (particularly the Chicago theme dishes).  And I would hope I could watch games without feed interruptions or unforeseen technical difficulties.  Perhaps today just wasn't their day, but I probably won't be back soon.",

As another poster said there are hidden rooms and lounge areas off nearly every dining area. Fortunately it's easy enough to find your way around. Lighting was dim. Music was a little loud though; I don't think the sound on the TVs were even on. Even when people were in there for the game (which was that evening) it wasn't overly noisy. It was though hard to hear one another in our room which surprised me as our room separated us from the rest of the restaurant.  They have a good beer selection and beer-food. I had a simple appetizer, the burgers my friends had smelled delicious (bbq sauce, cheese and bacon, yum!) and the wings looked decent enough but a lot of the food seemed over priced to me. $4.50 for edamame in a bowl similar in size to a Like It from Cold Stone....  Also, while their bathrooms were great looking (very clean which is always nice) I was extremely surprised that none of the stalls had a hook for a purse of a jacket. I'm glad I left my purse at my table, I'm not a fan of sitting it on a public bathroom floor but I had to throw my jacket over the stalls door and while that doesn't bother me greatly, I'd much rather have it hanging in my stall.  I've been to better sports grills (Goldies, Fox, Zipps) but I've been to worse.",

Inevitably, this ends up as a free-for-all alcohol orgy that will always involve several Mechiladas (they will make em for you if you write the recipe down on a napkin with the special, final ingredient being \"lots of love\" as a reminder not to forget the extra love that goes into a perfect Mechi), some chick-shots that sadly include Red Bull and something else equally garish so that it tastes like almost-flat Squirt, a death swig of Wild Turkey out of the fanciest slingback shoe in the group (If you do two consecutively, we call it a \"Bingo-Bango\"), several double-tall Vodka/Soda/Lemons, 250 Parliament Ultra Light cigarettes, and a single Chicken Caesar Wrap.  By this time, I am usually craning my neck to see the HM's awkwardly placed LCD screens and drunkenly rambling very loudly about how \"Tim Duncan can suck my cock\" (2005), or how \"Nowitzki can suck my cock\" (2006), or how \"I wish I had multiple cocks so the whole city of San Antonio can suck my cocks and then beat David Stern with them about the neck and chest until he begged for clemency from my multiple cock beat-down\" (2007).  Anyway, this location is a decent spot for some casual game-watching, but IMO, not for the nexus of critical game watching, like your alma mater playing your sister-kissin rivals from that fucktarded state to the (east/west/south/north).  My buddies and I particularly like catching the US Men's National (soccer) Team here -- once they even put it on the Mexican Channel to enhance the excitement!  Later arriving patrons seemed very cautious and confused upon entry, but felt the Sunday mechilada love as we put a \"Dos-a-uno\" mudholing on 'El Pinche Tri' (Mexican MNT).  The staff here is friendly enough to put it on any channel you'd like too -- I've had to specially request the Titans game on a few occasions (why the fuck doesn't anyone like to watch Tennessee, anyway?) without any kind of eye-rolling despair from the bartenders/servers.  Its also surprisingly entertaining as a pre-bars destination or even before that for Happy Hour.  The mood is more \"lounge\" than \"sports bar\"    One thing I always thought was unusual, however, was the lack of taps.  I mean, there is no draft beer at all.  And their Mexican Beer selection could use a little upgrading from the college selections (Corona, Dos XX) to the big boys (Negra Modelo, Bohemia).  Otherwise, this is a pretty cool bar in a typically stuffy part of town.",

Now, having been there, I can say I'd probably go there again, even if it weren't for the UFC fights.  It's a well-kept sports bar, with TVs galore, pretty decent bar food, and attentive service.  Whether it be for a beer with friends, or to watch sports on the weekend, I would definitely recommend checking this place out.  It seems to fill up quickly, though, so get there early if you're going for a particular game/fight.",

It seems as if the LSU alumni association chapter out here has a deal that they get one of the back rooms for game watching which is pretty cool (I'm not an LSU alum or a SEC fan...go Big 10!). The back room is pretty small, but it was the perfect size for the amount of LSU fans that showed up.   Our waitress was not very good at all. She never came back with ketchup after a friend asked for it. My table started with chips and queso as an appetizer.  The queso was pretty disgusting in my opinion and the chips were a tad too salty for my taste.  My BLT wrap was OK. The bacon was pretty well done like I requested, but the lettuce and tomato definitely dominated the sandwich. The beers were pretty cheap which I liked. The one thing I didn't understand was that the waitress requested a credit card from each of us upon our first order to start a tab.  I haven't encountered that in other restaurants so it threw me off guard.  I didn't even get an option of paying cash, as everything was charged to my card when the bill came out.  The actual restaurant area was a bit small, but the bar area was good sized. There was a nice outdoor patio with a fire pit as well. I would definitely go check it out again for happy hour, but probably not another sporting event.",

    "text": "People... stop waiting in line!  Saint Francis, The Windsor,  Barrio Cafe, Oreganos, these places should be paying you to eat there, not having you waste your time waiting in line to be fed. If you are looking for one delicious hamburger, excellent service and not a 30 - 45 minute wait then look no further. Half Moon Sports Grill (Biltmore/Highland) I stopped in one weekend to catch the first couple of innings of a Diamondbacks baseball game and OMG, it was like finding a $50 dollar bill on the ground! I walked in on 119 degree day and was welcomed with a cold blanket of relief. It must have been 72 degrees in the restaurant. I didn't want to leave until late October. I was quickly greeted by a friendly staff member and was instructed to sit wherever my heart desired. The waiter/waitress in training notified me of the specials, $3 draft beers and half price burgers all weekend long. What else could you ask for- $3 beer and half price burgers. I ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheddar served on a pretzel bun and holy Gordon Ramsay it was cooked to perfection. The dish even came with sweet potatoes fries which I generally am not interested in but was quite flavorful.  The entire time I was eating I just couldn't figure why there was only 12 people in the entire restaurant.  It was an awesome experience and at a fraction of the price. It just solidified my belief that you don't have to wait in a 45 minute line to enjoy a good meal. So get off that ridiculous waiting list to be seated and get over to Half Moon Sports Grill and enjoy!",

Unless you are a male or have a male in your party good luck getting any service.   The men got refills on their drinks four or five time, my female cowork and I had to ask for the one refill that we did get.  The men got their food in a timely manner, we had to ask how much longer for our food, maybe she didn't put our order in right away.   We both had burgers and needless to say they were nothing great.  The bun used on the burger takes away from all the other flavors in the burger.  The food was just plain,  When we were done eating I had to go find our serve to get our check.  We spent almost an hour in this place and it wasn't very busy.  All the other tables seated after us were empty and cleaned up and we still had our dirty dishes sitting there.  Again, not a good place for two females to got grab a bite at.",

The place is fairly large, with 2 bars, booths and tables, an outdoor seating area with misters and TVs, and some back rooms that seem to have enormous TVs set up. I've sat at the bar all times I've been (during the day) and have received pretty prompt service. They only have 1 beer on tap, and not a huge selection, which seems strange for a sports bar. Their food is also mediocre at best; I had a salad that was only OK, and boneless chicken wings that were less than OK. The real draw here is all the sports broadcasting. They had both soccer games up on screens next to each other last time I went, so we could easily go back and forth between the games. I would say that this is the bar's redeeming quality.  Pros: Good place to WATCH sports, lots of TVs            Friendly servers  Cons: Food and beer",

I explained no, I was not part of that group; I was meeting other friends. I was told that the bar was at capacity and they would not let me in. At that moment, a couple walked up behind me and went through the same questioning process with the hostess. They were not there for the meet up group, and the name of the reservation they provided to the hostess was not on her list. She let them in anyway right in front of me. When I asked her again to please let me in she told me she couldn't because if she made an exception for me she would have to make an exception for everyone. I pointed out to her that she made an exception for the couple who arrived after me. She explained that the other hostess had left and she couldn't accompany them to the table to verify the reservation because she was by herself but assured me she could kick them out if she wanted to.

    "text": "If you are a Bears fan, then do NOT go to Half Moon Windy City Sports Grill. This bar calls itself a Bears' Bar, but after watching one game there, I can honestly say that this description is a fallacy. I called ahead and, they said they aired the Bears game and the audio would be turned on. We drove 20 minutes to get to the bar, and were excited upon arriving. We were seated in the corner near the bathroom (this didn't bother us as we had 4 TVs nearby).  The audio for the Bears game was on and we were pumped up. Then everything started to go downhill rapidly. We attempted to order the only beer 'special' (it's the same price everyday) they had, $2 Old Style cans. They were sold out, and didn't offer a replacement. On opening day of the Bears 2014 season they didn't even offer any sort of beer specials. They did have $12 bottomless mimosas (excellent deal and no complaints as they were usually topped off before empty). I understand that it is an early game (10:00AM), but there should be some sort of beer special. That was strike one, strike two came as the game was about to start.  We anxiously awaited kickoff, then we started to glance around the room. Out of the 4 TV's immediately in our vicinity, only ONE had the Bears game on. To make matters worse, 2 of these TVs had the Rams-Vikings game on! I immediately thought that there was a mistake and asked our server if they could change the TV nearest us (which was one of the two TVs next to each other that had the Rams-Vikings game on) to the Bears. Our waiter politely said they could not change the channels, but would talk to the manager for us. The manager was quite rude with us, and said that there was no way to possibly change any channels. As she was stating this, we noticed that the fourth TV was switched to the Falcons vs Saints game. I love being lied to directly to my face. After the manager left, I decided to look around the rest of the room, at the 9 other TVs I could see from my seat. The Bears game was on ONE more TV, but don't worry, the Rams-Vikings game was also on another TV. This place is clearly more supportive of the Rams and/or Vikings than of the Bears, which seems odd since the owner claims to have been born & raised in Chicago. I highly doubt the owner was from Chicago.    Their menu includes a section labeled \"Chicago Thin Crust Pizza\". As most are aware, Chicago is famous for their deep dish pizzas, but they also have a thin crust pizza that is almost as delicious. This is definitely not it though. The 'pizza' they serve should not actually be called pizza, it's more accurately described as crackers with a little bit of cheese on it. Although that is not even an accurate description, as crackers have some thickness to them. This pizza featured a crust that was at best postcard-thin, and at worst toilet paper-thin. Everyone that has been to Chicago (let alone born and raised) would be offended by what they call a pizza.  One friend of mine ordered the Kale & Quinoa salad. She loved the taste of the salad, but was disappointed at the size of it. It costs $7.89 and is served in a large bowl, but the salad itself is barely larger than a standard size side salad. The waiter graciously removed the salad from her bill, so I can't complain too much on that.  My girlfriend had the Fish & Chips. The fries were excellent. They had a great crisp and flavor to them. She also stated that she loved the fish.  So, Half Moon evidently is capable of making quality food.  The men's bathroom did feature the Bears game at one of the stalls, however, the women's bathroom just featured advertisements for exercise classes. Both of the women I was here with commented at this and they were quite annoyed as they both came to watch the Bears play. I would think most fans (whether male or female) would much rather watch the game than be bombarded with whatever sexist advertisements this bar picked out.  As a Chicago native, I am appalled at how Half Moon calls itself a Bears bar, or uses Chicago anywhere in the description of it. If you want to say you support a certain team, then you should make sure that said team is on the majority of the TVs in your establishment. Having the game on ~15% of the TVs is just unacceptable. They should also drop the Chicago from their pizza titles as it is clearly misleading. It is akin to someone making a Chicago Style Philly Cheesesteak, you just don't do something like that. The only upside to this place was that our waiter was excellent and apologized 10 times during the game.  Ideally management would never put it's staff in the position of being forced to apologize so much.  We seriously debated leaving the bar to go to an actual Bears Bar (there are some great ones in Phoenix), unfortunately it is nearly impossible to get a table after kickoff anywhere. We took a chance on a new bar to watch the games at, and it bit us in the ass. I will NEVER return to Half Moon even if they offer me free food and drinks to do so.",

    "text": "How I write Yelp reviews, by Andrew K. Fromaz. (this IS my real name. my real nom de plume)  I start out by identifying an establishment I vaguely want to try, and finding an occasion or reason to go there.  In this case, a fellow Yelper Christina P set up a special Happy Hour event on a Friday at Half Moon Sports Grill on Highland.  I'd been to Half Moon before, and it was not exactly on my list of places to hurry back to and try again, for reasons which will gradually become evident...  I get to the restaurant, and go in, briefly (if at all) taking note of the decor, the attitude of the staff I encounter along the way, the crowd, the music playing, occasionally the lighting... anything that jars or that i happen to notice that i like.  This is how I (and anyone else fortunate enough to have full use of their five senses) determine the \"vibe\" of a place.   Half Moon seems like a typical upper-tier sports bar, pleasant hostess, apparently clean, lots of big TVs, small booths...  Nothing not to like, honestly.  The \"vibe\" is that this is a pretty nice place.    I sit down and look over the menu, searching for anything that particularly catches my interest.  I'm not a picky eater, so usually I have a hard time narrowing it down to one thing.  The first time I was here, I was pretty hungry, so the blue cheese burger caught my eye.  On a more recent visit, appetizers were on Happy Hour so I tried a few of those.  Here's the bottom line.  None of it was very good.  Like, I would actively avoid eating any of the food again.  The pretzel, which was recommended, was dry inside and oily outside - like it had been coated with some form of fake butter.  The burger was only ok.  The boneless wings were the only thing that I would order again (I think we got medium?)  Anyway, over the course of the visit I put together all of these impressions and write a review, usually deciding whether or not I'll return.  Sorry, Half Moon, I want to love you, but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.",

I ordered the garlic breadsticks.  Wow. They were FUCKING AMAZING!!!!!!  The garlic had a particular sweetness, and the cheese was slightly gooey, but not like napalm on your tongue.  The sauce was pretty good too, but I was so focused on the breadsticks, I couldn't say for sure.  They easily made a meal. I was full, and happy.

I can speak to the service, the mood/ambiance and the facilities.  Everyone there from servers to patrons were always very nice and down to earth. I enjoyed watching whatever sporting event was showing at the time. And the fire pit they have outside is so nice on a nice spring/winter night.  They always had a food or beverage special going on.

They recently, well within the last year, renovated their patio, it needed it! They have a fun fireplace in the order, high top tables, a pool table and new flat screen tv's out there now. Inside, the bar is big, tons of TVs and a private room that you can reserve for you and your friends for less distraction while watching the game or fight. **They don't charge for Pay-Per-View fights!!! :-)   As I said in my review of other Half Moon's their food is really good for bar food and they have some of the best fries I have found in this state. I also recommend the Long Island Iced Tea, be careful though, more than two and you will be on your ass.",

The good deal was found at Half Moon... the good food was NOT.  We ordered 4 appetizers to share during our recent happy hour, and I was completely underwhelmed.    The pretzel - the high point of the apps. Simple, tasty.  Perhaps a little too salty, but nonetheless, yummy.  Chips with queso - Queso?  Really?  More like microwaved Velveeta with some salsa stirred in.  Just screamed \"processed food\".  There are so many places with a quality queso dip around - Half moon should ask for a recipe suggestion.  Boneless wings - Not bad.  Fairly tasty little nuggets.  Unfortunately, there were only about 6 tiny little pieces.  They obviously price them high to make up for your happy hour savings.  Frito/Chili Nacho thing - Really? That's IT? Just a handful of Fritos with some seemingly canned chili poured over the top.  SO boring.   Half Moom: Please, please, please... don't rely on your happy hour prices and big tvs to bring people back.  Without decent food, I definitely have no incentive to return.",

I've always enjoyed it on game day but was a little skeptical about having a work party with 50+ people.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the excellent service, great food and overall atmosphere!   Although I had planned to have the party on the patio and even had the staff go to heroic efforts in setting up a powerpoint projector and screen there, they didn't blink when we decided it was too hot 25 minutes before the planned start time. They actually smiled while they quickly helped move all of our decorations and their serving dishes inside.   The party went off without a hitch. The food was delicisious, the atmosphere was great BUT what really made the party a success was the staff!   Thank you Chelsea, Todd, Kayla, Sarah and all the rest of the staff that made our event such a success! We'll definitely be back!",

I've lived in the neighborhood for about 5 years now.  I've been to this restaurant probably a dozen times over the years. Each time my husband and I always say the same thing.... WHY did we come here again???  Service is slow,  the bartenders are slow AND unfriendly.  I read a comment below that they seem bothered that they have to wait on you and I totally agree.  The food is very hit or miss, and from what we've had it's usually a miss.  We use to catch UFC fights, hockey, and football games there.  Now that there are more sports bar options in our neighborhood, our days of throwing money towards Half Moon are no more.",

    "text": "Does the New Times have a better opinion than me?  That was the question I tried to answer when I went here to try out the wings.  The New Times Best of Phoenix declared this restaurant as having the best wings, so I had to check it out.  *Side note* I used to regularly hang out at the Half Moon on Bell when I lived up in that big box/corporate chain infused section of town.  We went almost every weekend to partake in their real long island iced teas for $2.50 and enjoyed it despite it being a sports bar (we are not sports fans).  The food was pretty good and the booze even better.  Back to the review - It's a nice sports bar that manages to accomodate a plethora of sports fans with an insane number of TVs.  The hostess even asks which team you are trying to watch so that she can seat you accordingly.  Because we were there for the food, and not the sports, we were seated immediately and without hassle.  Luckily, we happened to sit near the TVs playing the Bills, so we payed a little bit of attention.  You can order the wings by poundage - 1/2, 1, or 2 - not by number of wings, which was a little confusing for us.  We're used to ordering a dozen per person if it's the meal, half for an appetizer.  Because neither of us were overly hungry ,we ordered 1 pound medium with a side of hot.  What we got was 9 wings without sauce and a side of \"hot sauce\" for $9. That's right, $1 per wing.  I already felt hosed, but I was willing to forgive the price for the allegedly best wings in Phoenix.  No sauce on the wings.  They were cooked crispy as we asked them to be, and they were somewhat meaty.  The side of \"hot sauce\" was a small container of gelatinous chili sauce, like the stuff they give to you at Asian restaurants. No flavor, just hot.  Luckily, the Long Island Iced Tea was just as tasty as I remember, otherwise I would have left very unhappy.  I wouldn't make a point of going here for wings.  They aren't even as adequate as the \"good\" wings I've found in Phoenix.  But for all of you non-purists, they do have BBQ, Thai Peanut and other flavors.  Oh yeah, I forgot about the statement on the menu that claims that separate checks \"MASSIVELY\" slows down the service. Really? Seriously?  This isn't a problem at many restaurants at which I have attended with a large group.  This isn't really conducive to a sports bar, as far as I'm concerned.  Wouldn't it be wonderful to meet a bunch of friends to watch your favorite team and not have to worry about separate checks \"MASSIVELY\" slowing down your service?  Don't try it here, they warn you against it before you even order food.",

Worse than that though was the fact that a portion of our group came here specifically so we could watch a baseball game.  They kept changing the channel from the game to another.  After we explained we were watching that, they'd change it back...until they changed it again 5 minutes later.  This literally happened 5 times until we just gave up.    The lone bright spot here is they have some pretty good beer on tap.  There were 3 New Belgium handles and some Goose Island.",

The place had a few over 50 guys sitting around.   I did try their award winning LAVA sauce, which was interesting, fruity , sweet with a slow burn. I would have liked a jar of that.

I was there last night for a large group viewing of a football game and in addition to a lack of any type of air conditioning in 105 degree weather outside, the drinks were lacking any alcohol being paid for as well as much ice and that is even if you could get somebody to actually take an order and come back with that order filled.  (We were warned the service is sketchy, at best.  I should not be surprised.)  After 30 minutes, we finally got drinks and an hour later, finally our meal that was ordered.  Yes, there were quite a few people in the bar although the reservation was set over a month ago for this large group so of course staffing was plentiful.    And, lets discuss the comfort... NONE.  I have never been so uncomfortable in any establishment in my life.   An overhead ceiling fan would have made the entire difference... just a note.  BUT, I did have a great time with our friends and no matter where we decide to meet up again, I'll be there.. unless its this place.",

    "text": "So as a born and raised Chicago kid i want to love this place. As it's a cool venue with tons of space, great tvs and a cool patio. I have been there several times however and not had great experiences. I think it comes down to service and the demeanor of the staff. The main issue is we have hosted two post charity events there two years apart. We organize it contact the venue so they know 100 people are showing up at 9-10pm both times they cut their whole staff 1 hour before we arrive so there are 2 bartenders and a couple servers for 100 people. Time to get a cocktail at the bar 30-45 min in most cases, ticket times for food about 45 to an hour.  The staff is very pissy about it to. They could have earn 30-40% more revenue in both cases as people were scared to order food and just did not order drinks. It's really frustrating that after working hard for this charity event for 3 months to show up to a hostile environment to celebrate. Anyway if you looking for a good place to watch sports it fits the bill but i would avoid any large group events or busy days if you are sensitive the a side of attitude. Cheers!",

We shared the Italian Hoagie, and he had a spicy enchilada soup which he was so busy eating that he didn't even slow down to talk.  He was still finishing his soup as I ate the last of my Hoagie.  Let me tell you, I was seriously eying his untouched half I had enjoyed mine so much.  The Italian Hoagie was on a delicious, perfectly crusty roll, with Genoa salami, pepperoni, cured ham, provolone, giardiniera, peppers, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo and Italian dressing. When ordering, I was tempted to omit the mayo (which I don't generally eat), but I followed my gut and decided to have the hoagie just the way they usually prepare it.  I was so glad that I did.  Taking a bite into the crisp roll, my mouth was then filled with delicious meat and cheese, spicy savory toppings and the juiciness of the mayo and tangy Italian dressing.  It was love at first bite for me.  Next time I'm having a whole hoagie of my own!  We sat at the bar, and service was very friendly and very efficient, and they seemed to be constantly available.  The ambiance was pleasant, and since they weren't too busy during my visit, the noise level was not a factor.  This is a trip across town for me, but I will absolutely be making the trip again soon.  It may be awhile until I get past the Hoagie to try something else on the menu!!!",

The bar service is mediocre, (they seem to pick and choose based on who they know), and the drinks are average. The patio with pool tables are nice, (and it gets you out of the mop bucket), we ordered food which was good but I was highly suspicious being if the restaurant stunk what was the kitchen's shortcomings.

To our surprise they did have the Cubs vs the hometown Diamondbacks game on but the audio in the bar area was turned on to the LA Rams vs Dallas Cowboys PRESEASON football game.  I'm rather confused as how you can bill yourself as a Windy City Sports Grill in Phoenix, Arizona and when the Cubs are playing the Diamondbacks and you have Rams vs Cowboys audio on.  Go Cubs Go!",

I ordered a \"punch bowl\" it's the only place I've ever gotten one or even tried one.  It was on their menu for Sundays before they changed their menu to something new. Asked for it and I get a \"yeah....no don't know what that is and my manager doesn't know what that is so we don't have it.\" What do you mean you don't have it? It was on your menu?!?!? This place has so many memories for me and I truly mean great memories. I got over the waitress spilling a glass of wine on me, getting the wrong orders, waiters taking forever and people being rude... patience I do have. But when you give me a shitty attitude when I ask for something on your menu.... it's simply unacceptable. Gave it 2 stars only for the wings and fries. Otherwise it would have been 1 star. Disappointed.",

Service was pretty friendly, atmosphere fine, just the food was, well, kinda non-descript.  The Valley has a number of these Chicago-type places around, but I don't know if I'd call this one of the better ones.  No, it was not really that bad, but with other spots around that are much better, Half Moon really didn't stand out for me.  YMMV.",

I go out because I want someone to take care of me, to entertain me I guess. Otherwise I'd just stay home and eat and drink.   The last time I was there, I left my card on the bar to cash out -- my beer had long since been empty and the bartenders clearly had no interest in refilling it. Time to go. He came over, asked me if I was ready to cash out and I said Yes! and pushed my card towards him. Rather than taking my card, he ran off, came back with my check and ran away again without taking my payment. Still waiting over here! The guy next to me was quite entertaining telling me that they don't let you leave.  I've been up to the store on Bell. The service there is much better. As for this one near the Biltmore, I'll avoid it.",

I called earlier and was told that they \"do not make reservations on event night\", which is fine by me. I got here at exactly 6:05pm. The place was full but not packed, once I got to the hostess they asked if I had a reservation, which shocked me at first since I was told they did not make reservations. I needed a table for 6, but I told the hostess she could put me wherever there was space and we would figure from there. I waited for 2 hours and saw people who got there AFTER me getting seated before, so I once again told them they could fit me at ANY table and I would be ok. That's when I noticed a table for 6 opened up, after 2 and half hours, which made me happy, BUT of course not. A couple that got here 30 minutes before that got seated at that table, and when I questioned about it I was told 3 different stories. THREE!!!! 1st was that they had been here for 4 hours. LIES. 2nd was that they PAID for that table a while ago. I'm sorry, what? They don't make reservations but they accept payment? And last one, which was the worst to me, is that they had made a reservation, MISSED THEIR TIME, but once they got here they spoke to the manager and the manager made the call to sit them BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE! I'm sorry, what?! ABSURD!! Do they make reservations or not? So bribery works? The manager never bothered to come speak to us, clear things up. HE DIDNT STAND UP FOR HIS DECISION. The hostess was also very weak because she couldn't even get her story straight. It was ridiculous. I felt disrespected as a customer. Why does someone get special treatment?! I even offered to pay for a table if that was what it took to be seated at this ridiculous restaurant. Absurd. Never coming back to this place again.",

Hubby and I also shared a small pizza which was surprising really tasty! Only thing that wasn't so great was our waitress.

Personal pizza (just okay) and chicken fingers plus 7 beers only $40!!!   If you don't mind old men (or you're one yourself) this is the place to be.",

I was not starving and just wanted a bite with my beer so I was happy to see the zucchini starter which was breaded with a Parmesan crust and served with ranch dressing, it was the perfect side to my beveridge.  The only thing I would do different is cut the zucchini into spears for dipping rather than the coins.  Comfortable space that I would definitely visit again.",

I had the food delivered (postmates) and I opened the side of fries and they were amazing. Crispy, well seasoned, and not over-fried. When I opened the dog.....it visually was not appealing. The bun was damn near rock hard and it eventually split in half and became very difficult to chew yet alone swallow because it was obviously stale. So stale. I don't even know WHY the person who prepared the dog thought a rock hard hotdog bun is okay to be served.   I also ordered 6 \"nuclear\" wings for a coworker. They're advertised as stupid spicy or whatever. The wings were dry, looked like they've been left out for a few hours, and are definitely not stupid spicy. After the disappointing hotdog, I did not want to stick a shriveled, dry chicken wing into my mouth.   Next time....I'll make the drive to portillos or fly to Chicago for quality food.",

    "text": "STAY AWAY!!! SERIOUSLY DONT WASTE YOUR $$  Being a native Chicagoan I had high hopes. As someone who has been a server and bartender for the last 10 years...I had mediocre expectations seeing as how it was game day. Walking in, the place was DEAD. I mean DEAD. The TVs were cool, the bar was nice and big...empty...nice big and empty. The restaurant was super empty. There were maybe a dozen people in here tops!   Our server was a millennial - so again mediocre expectations - even with the place being dead I was anticipating a half ass attempt. Maybe it was her unkept hair or the skirt she had on that was way to big...or that she dragged her feet when she walked as if to say \"I seriously do not want to be here right now\". I will nevermind the fact that she didn't even know whose football jersey she had on. Lol. The girl must have a severe allergy to smiling too because that was not happening.   The first round of beers took about 15 mins to get to our table. The waters ....about 20mins. Strange because beer comes in a bottle and water out of a tap. So...unless the entire bar was out of bottle openers and faucets...I can't see why this took so long. Whatever, overlooked it because I was anticipating authentic Chicago eats!!!   I ordered a Maxwell street polish. My boyfriend ordered a burger. His brother - a burger and his brothers wife - a salad. My boyfriend's brother had a plane to catch so we had time but not a ton of \"waiting for our waitress to stop facebooking on the clock at the hostess stand\" time.   The food came an hour later. AN HOUR for two burgers a salad and a freaking glorified hot dog. It takes less time to drive to Fry's, buy ground beef, heat the grill, make 2 burgers, chop a salad, and microwave a hot dog. Whatever, overlooking it because the food is going to be so good.......right?   NOT! NOT EVEN CLOSE! The burgers sat under the heat lamp in the kitchen window for what must have been an eternity, or at least thats what the burger texture told us. My polish sausage bun was so hard I could knock on the table with it. You know when you find old hot dog buns in the BACK of the pantry and say \"oh we'll feed it to the birds bc its obviously old and stale\", and when you do the buns just crumble into dust particles? THIS WAS MY BUN! The salad was \"fine\". SHOCKER  I ask the food runner (oh no wait she was the shift manager. Why the shift manager is running the food for the complacent millennial waitress is beyond me)- can you go get me another bun so i don't break my teeth on this thing. She says sure no problem and takes the entire basket of food away. My boyfriend's brother also asked for a new burger and asked to make it quick this time because he had a plane to catch. She whisks off into the kitchen and he and I wait. My boyfriend decided to keep his burger because he was starving and didn't want to hulk out in the restaurant. He ate a few bites of it and was completely grossed out. It was rubbery and the cheese was hard.   20 mins later still no new burger and no new hot dog bun. WTH!!!??!?! I go to the hostess station and the hostess is facing the corner texting on her phone. I stand and wait for her to finish......and wait........and wait........and shake my head giggle and wait. She turns around and says \"OMG I'm so sorry....can i help you?\" i tell her to finish her text, that I can wait. She laughs and says no its ok how can I help you. I ask to speak w/  a manager. She asks why and I want to say \"to rat on you for texting at the hostess station kiddo\", but tell her I have a question. I wait and wait and wait she never comes back. I walk BACK to my table and there's the manager...at the table. Wait she's the food runner? Apparently not...she's the shift manager. My boyfriend and his brother explain what an ordeal its been. She apologizes and brings a new burger and polish out. We asked what was going on in the kitchen and what is with the servers crap attitude? I mean not even pretending to be appreciative that she has a job! The manager kind of had the same attitude though. We got a very scripted apology and a $25 gift card. The manager said \" i will make sure we take the second polish off your bill and the hamburger\". I'm sorry the SECOND polish? I asked for a new bun not an entirely new polish sausage. Really? You really think you're doing me a solid by taking the second polish off the bill...as in...you were going to charge me for 2 but since we voiced our concerns w/ our service your manager in training etiquette and experience in customer service compelled you to \"comp\" the 2nd polish sausage? Get outta here.   We will NEVER come here again. We used the gift card to pay for the salad, the other burger that my boyfriend had 2 bites of, and the beers.   STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT!!! THE STAFF IS TERRIBLE THE MGMT IS TERRIBLE THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE THE KITCHEN IS TERRIBLE. I could see if they were swamped...then maybe I wouldn't be so brutally honest but they weren't! NO EXCUSE!",

Ok, now on to the other stuff...  The bar/restaurant is quite large so there are plenty of tables and seats.  I surveyed the view from many of the seats and most provide a good view of one or more TVs.  In the main room, I believe they even have a projector style TV with a huge screen.  One word of caution, if you're going for a Bears game, the seats do fill up quickly!  The servers all seem to be on top of their game (no pun intended).  Ordering food and drinks is easy even when this place is busy... and the kitchen and bartenders get the food and drinks out quickly!  I have had the pizza multiple times.  To me, the pizza crust is not as thick as a Chicago-style thin crust should be... but the taste is top-notch!  The crust has crunch, the toppings are piled on, and the sauce is just the right combination of sweet and tangy.    Drink prices a little pricey, but certainly not outrageous.  I'll definitely be back!!",

    "text": "Football Sunday~As a first-timer at Half Moon I wanted to like this new sports bar adventure. I really, really did. I wanted to hang out, I wanted to order food, I wanted to drink beer & I really wanted to enjoy an afternoon of football. However, there was not one single, itsy-bity, tiny thing that was redeemable about our experience.   The restaurant/bar was nearly empty. There were more food servers than patrons. When we were seated conveniently next to the kitchen we were quite optimistic. We thought, \"YAY! We will receive good service & the food will be prepared properly and not rushed.\" Ha-ha, (resounding laughter) on us.   We began by ordering the nachos, the pesto hummus & 2 ice teas. The nachos were a horrible culinary choice. The chips were stale, the cheese sauce was 2 opposing colors of orange & yellow & it had the same food film that pudding gets when it's old.  We had to send it back. I was absolutely astounded as my dining companion has a stomach made of steel & would eat asphalt if it were deep-fried.  The hummus place was nearly as unappetizing, the pita bread was hard & the accompanying vegetables were soggy. The hummus was a curdling swamp of what we believed to be pesto soup.   At this juncture, I literally had to stand up & wave with manic jazz hands to get us a refill of ice tea. After an extended period of time, our 2nd or maybe even 3rd, server brought  our ice tea, which was neither iced nor in any possible way resembled tea. An oxymoron for sure.   Still we asked our server what she would recommend on a re-order & her response was an hysterically emphatic, \"I don't eat here.\"    In conclusion, I want my $30.00 back so I can use it next time a Zipps.   Thanks!",

    "text": "Out of all the places to eat, my son chose this place for his bday dinner (he wanted to watch some of the Cardinals game this past Thursday).  For the record, we are long time customers. We've eaten here dozens of times.   We arrived around 530PM and were seated almost immediately.  Here is where the experience went to hell in a hand basket.   Waitress made her appearance 15 min after we sat down.   It took another 15 min to get our drinks and get our order in. We were a party of 4, in case you're wondering.  The food finally arrived at 6:45 and we haven't seen our waitress since the order was placed. The food was wrong, and the waitress is still MIA. The hostess helped us more than the waitress ever did. I requested to speak with a manager two separate times and he never came by.  The hostess continues to run around doing the waitresses job.  She was amazing.  She attempted to make excuses for the manager, short staffed etc. I didn't care, you have a manager to deal with these issues and when they don't, why have them?  We were finally eating, but by the time my daughters order was corrected it was 7:30PM. 2 hours after we arrived!  Now, they were busy but never busy enough to excuse the lack of care and service. From the top down. If the manager didn't give a rats ass about what we had to say, I certainly wouldn't expect the waitress to.  Now, it was busy but new patrons arriving were also seated quickly. So it wasn't that busy.   Needles to say, we finally paid our check at 7:57PM, per my CC slip.  My kids bed time is 8:30PM, so as you can imagine that didn't help. As for the tip, the waitress didn't deserve one. I told my wife to write \"not earned\" - but I know she didn't. On my way out, the hostess received the 20% gratuity, because she took care of us best as she could.  For the record, I have never not left a tip. But this experience put me over the edge.   My opinion for a solution: Cardinals were playing the Niners, and you're managing a sports bar - no brainer right?   The manager MUST ensure he/she has adequate staffing to deal with the event. If there were call offs, call people in to help you. You can't allow the bad service to continue. I know we were not the only customers voicing our displeasure. You should have heard the folks next to us.  In this business you want to retain customers-and this isn't the way to do it.  Unfortunately, you must Terminate the on duty manager!  He/she should have never allowed it to get this bad.  My primary reason for being so harsh, a customer requested to speak with the manger - twice!  The manager rejected the request! As for the waitress, she's a product of her leadership.  Leadership that has completely failed her.   Happy bday to my son!  Too bad it included this experience.",

The wings are the only food that gives you \"bang for your buck.\" The happy hour is good... but they only have 8 beers on tap. I only go here because it's walking distance from my home. It's a good happy hour place for a group of 4 or less, but any more and you may be waiting to get a table. And the service is ok, but not particularly fast.",

They have goose island here on tap-which is my preferred draft. You can catch most games here and UFC fights. The restaurant is clean, modern and family friendly. There are multiple areas to sit, including a spacious patio. The staff is very friendly for the most part. Bathrooms are interesting.. there was a cardio hip-hop video playing in the women's restroom the last time I went, but it was clean.    The food is okay, grades below:   B buffalo wing dip - very filling and large portion, waiter/waitress will refill chips B + Buffalo wings - boneless, tasty, medium was not as spicy as I would like but they give you the hotter sauce on the side if you want it B - Pretzel Fondue - the pretzel is really good, but the cheese sauce is a little too thin for me and lacking some flavor, might try adding a more fragrant cheese  Our friends had the thin crust pizza and that looked pretty good. I think they would give it an A.",

    "text": "I have been meaning to do another review of this place for quite sometime since everything has changed here.  They totally changed up the menu and specials and remodeled.  The new look of the dining room is pretty cool and much more open and they have a shuffle board table which is cool.  The patio is still pretty cool when the TVs are operational.  Service overall seems to have gotten better since they have reopened.  I am not a fan of the new menu at all.  They have changed the recipe of their hot wing sauce and I am not too found of them (they used to be my favorite wings in town).  I have had the pizza a couple times and it is absolutely awful, even for the 5 dollar special they have most evenings and weekends.  The crust is a good crispy thin crust, but the sauce has all of the flavor of maybe ketchup at best and there is barely enough cheese to cover the thing.  There are also now a handful of overpriced Chicago type of items on the menu like Chicago dogs, polish sausages, Italian sausage/beef, but there are so many other Chicago style restaurants in the area with better prices I find it hard to try any of them.  I have tried their cheese filled toasted ravioli which were cool on happy hour, but I think they have since removed those from the menu.  As far as drinks go if it is happy hour the $3 wells are the way to go.  Draft beers are I think $4 for HH and $5 regular which is strip club/night club pricey to me for a regular pint.  Wells are almost $5 when it is not happy hour as well, so I would suggest getting a long island for $5 which is huge and also good.  Overall even though I still frequent this place, I just cannot enjoy myself here like I used to and find myself going to Zipps more and more.  They have also kicked smokers off of half of the back half of the patio, I guess so they can open those doors on nice days.  This used to be a place where you could enjoy a nice cigar, a drink and watch the game.  Since they have moved the smoking area, you really cannot enjoy yourself the same way.  The space is more limited over on that side and the TVs are much smaller.  Not to mention only one of the two TVs over there works.  I would also think this change would bother non smokers too since the smoking area is now right next to the front door making all the customers walk past the smell.  Such a shame what happened here really.",

This event has been booked for weeks so management had plenty of notice to staff properly HOWEVER it took us about 30 to get a beer after waiting for a server, standing at the bar... We eventually got a table sat there for another 10 minutes with servers walking right by us. I finally got up asked a manager of we could get a server. She informed me that she had Two servers working the area with probably around 100 people and one would be over shortly. A very unfriendly server finally came over to our table. We had a huge fiasco trying to get quarters to play darts, it was just a really bad unfriendly, unorganized mess which is rather unfortunate because we were there to celebrate not to get dirty looks and terrible customer service! Needles to say I will never return to this place! I am on the board for this event so we will certainly NOT go here next year! What a disappointment!!",

Walked into the bar area and waited for 15 minutes before I finally flagged the bartender down. Then we she walked over she gives me attitude, I wasn't the one talking to my coworkers ignoring everyone at the bar, why should I get attitude? I told her I wanted to order something off of the breakfast menu and she informed me they stop serving at 12:00 (it was 12:08) so I replied,  \"if she had asked me what I wanted to order  when I came in it would have been before noon.\" Her reply'\" I guess, I can go ask them if they can still make something.\" She returned about 5 minutes later and said if I ordered immediately  they would do it, so I did.  About 5 minutes past that, the manager came up to me and told me \"Sorry, they had just thrown all the breakfast away.\" Customer service at its' finest, let me tell ya ! It's not like she doesn't know me, its' not like I'm some grease ball who doesn't tip, I actually over tip.   I think it's telling as you read these reviews, you pretty much get the same subject through all of them, good food, good facilities, TERRIBLE SERVICE !  If I were the management or ownership of this bar I'd be reading these reviews, because your staff just lost my business !  Only reason it is getting one star is because the review won't post without it !",

An alternative could have been to seat the guests and set the expectation that you're short staffed and it may take longer. We then left to twin peaks which was nearby. We then, regretfully, gave this place a second chance. The food here was terrible. No joke it gave me diarrhea and the wings tasted old. We didn't even finish our food and left hungry. On top of that we sat where we were facing a 22\" tv watching football so it didnt help the experience. We also felt bad for the waiter who was serving us because he was handling all the tables inside and outside, again short staffed. I completely agree with some of the reviews here that there is no management accountability here. We have been at the location in north phoenix and it is totally different than this location, it is a much better atmosphere and has much better tasting food.",

    "text": "Okay, I'm not one to typically complain but this was a HUGE let down.   First lets start with the positive aspects of our meal....   We were seated right away   The beer was cold  Now, on to business.  The waitress wasn't particularly friendly or outgoing, but whatever.  I ordered the Italian beef sandwich, my husband ordered the Italian beef salad and each child got a kid's cheese pizza.     To be fair, I am from Chicago and consider myself an Italian beef connoisseur so I may have high standards, but I have found that a True Chicago Italian beef sandwich is consistent at most Chicago places in the valley.  For starters it was pricey but not a big deal if it's good and big.......it was neither.  The bread was a soft roll you can find in any grocery store, the beef didn't really have any flavor, they were really stingy with the beef, the sweet peppers were more sour and tasted pickled and the whole thing was dry.    My husband's salad wasn't much better, they had ran out of spinach so the whole thing was made with romaine and everything was basically coated in oil from the beef. Definitely not the quality or size you expect from $10 salad.   The kid's pizza was actually decent quality, however, the crust is not what I would consider traditional Chicago thin crust.  The only issue with the pizzas was that they were brought out by Ms. Congeniality piping hot, any experienced server knows you don't bring out kid's food when it's the temperature of molten lava.  Not only did she bring it out hot, she told us it was hot as she placed it 2 inches away from my toddler. My hungry little quickly guy grabbed a piece before we could stop him and crammed it in his (pizza) pie hole..................you can imagine how that went.  Fairly certain my little munchkin now has PTSD from that pizza and was terrified to eat the rest of the night regardless of how much we blew on his pizza.   A lovely young lady came around asking how everything was, I can only assume she was a manager of some sort.  I gave her my honest review of the Italian beef to which she replied \"well, everyone likes their sandwich differently\".  Ummmm, not the response I was expecting but whatever.  I did disclose that I am from Chicago so I have a high standard for beef, she explained that she was from Joliet so she understood.  Hmmmmm, maybe this is how they like their beef in Joliet?  Although, she did offer us a free dessert or appetizer next time since our card had already been ran.    Not gonna lie, I felt like we were legit ripped off, 2 out of 4 meals were terrible, the service was borderline depressing and the kids meals weren't even free (per an advertisement I found online).  Not gonna lie, I felt like it was a complete waste of $50 but at least I know now that Luke's or Portillo's are still the best places to get a good Italian beef in the valley.",

I also like that there is a variety of beer on tap to satisfy the boy in me! Furthermore, I also agree that the place appears to be clean and nicely decorated...parking is easy in their private lot (this is HUGE for my impatient and against-forcing-customers-to-valet-park-even-if-\"free\" self!!!) ...plenty of TVs for the sports fans...BUT...the wait staff does a disappearing act about halfway through my meal. She was attentive at the beginning, but when I needed more sauce for my wings -POOF- she was gone- now you see her, now you don't!  Even after I was eating my tasty wings WITH NOTHING TO DIP IT IN, I could not find her to cash out. After reading the reviews that give props to the food and the place in general, I would think that management would put emphasis on making sure that superb customer service is delivered. I'm giving HM four stars because my overall visit was a good experience. I'm going to give them a get outta jail free card on the customer service aspect and will try them another day. I would like to check them out for a UFC fight night.",

The amount of TVs and the set up gives this place the potential to be one of the top sports bar in the Biltmore area if..... the food and beer selection kicked it up a few notches. I was going to give this bar more than 3 stars but after reviewing why other yelpers gave Half Moon a low star rating it reminded me of my first here and why I was disappointed in this place. I guess over time I have adjusted my view since it is the only bar I know of who shows the UFC fights in the area.   I can say over the past 3 years the food has improved some, but the establishment could really beef up the number of beers they have on tap",

Only about 7 craft beers though, but Magic hat #9 - one of the originals - was available on tap. Mostly older businessmen here on this night. The panko breaded zucchini was good as was the cool cucumber dip on the side for dipping. My original choice of chips, guac and salsa looked good, but I never have had a version of guacamole that was so hot. Ease up on the jalapeno's fellows. I had to return the stuff because nobody likes to sweat while eating guacamole. Bartender was nice and I exchanged it for a large Hot pretzel. This was very good, nice and hot and salty and not too much butter. Used the cucumber dip as I'm not a mustard fan and no cheese sauce was offered. Sandwiches, etc seemed pricey and the Biltmore area upcharge appeared to be in effect. Lots of TV sets, so seems to be a pretty solid sports bar, although I could do without the picture of a guy's butt crack in the men's room. Put that poster in the women's room please - homophobia still exists.",

    "text": "Yesterday would've made twice we've been here. And when I say we, I mean my work group of about 30.   This time around they put it in the back lounge area that is separate from the rest. We all sat comfortably, it was two rows of tables, but we were still able to talk across tables and heads no problem. We got there a few minutes before 11am, stood at the front for awhile before a man, I think the bartender, walked up and we told them we're the party of 30. He walked to the back and made sure it was ready and told us we can go back. The waitress was finishing putting down menus when we walked in, it was a nice quiet room, a table to the side for anything to be placed, tv's all around the room, even a circle of comfy chairs off to the side.  I was a little worried because it was only the one girl. She came over and took our drink orders and they were brought out promptly...mind you there was only TWO of us so far, more and more ladies started coming in, and she handled it no problem. After about 10mins and everyone had their drinks she started taking orders from me and my coworker, she worked her way down and than to the second table. After she left with our orders, we waited....and waited...and waited. Our waitress came in and refilled our drinks during that time. Finally about 40mins later, our food started coming in. Only it was the other tables orders. LOL we were sitting there like okay, didn't we order first?? Than after they were served, we waited for another 10mins and than our table started getting food. Which mind you, the other table was already half way done with theirs. It got to the point I forgot what flavor wings I got. So I had to wait and hope the others knew what they got LMAO!  A lot of the ladies ordered the half sandwhich and side combo, don't do it!! I can make you a better sandwhich at the house. We kept laughing and teasing those who go it. It looked so sad and disappointing on the plate!! The bread doesn't look toasted..it's not brown, but it is hard. We were telling the ladies it doesn't come toasted but stale! LOL! Two ladies were eating and one said to the other, where we going after this? Taco Bell the other said!! LMAO!! Another coworker on the other table did go through McDonalds after, she said she didn't even finish her's as it wasn't that good.  From the looks of it, everyone like the wings and fries. Ask for extra sauce if you get the wings, as I saw that several plates the sauce was skimpy and didn't completely cover the boneless or bone in wings, but everyone was saying the flavors were delicious.  Besides the wings I ordered the Chi-Fries and boy am I glad I researched here before hand. I would've been in the sandwhich combo boat with everyone else otherwise! Chi-Fries was a large portion and delicious, I really liked the fries. You have to hurry and eat it though, as it cooled it didn't taste that great.  Finally, she started taking cash/cards and than we waited...and waited...and waited...Thankfully I gave my card because we were split checks and she had to call out, combo with a twenty dollar bill. LOL! Where the dude would just look at our name on the card and call it out. One of the coworkers was debating on leaving a tip. But I told her and those around, she didn't cook the meal, she kept our drinks filled and for it just being her for THIRTY PEOPLE, she did the best she could. The waitress was really nice too, so she did leave a tip for her. Maybe management can plan better when there's a large group coming in. One waitress for thirty is not enough.",

The bartender and servers were hanging outside with their friends and ignored anyone else. The special on Monday's are their wings, save your money and order something else, but not the pizza, it was equally bad.  A local hotel offers 15% off the bill if you show them your room key, even though I asked prior to ordering,  the check came without the deduction.   Had to wait for my server for at last 10 minutes to acknowledge the mistake and another 5 minutes for the manager to correct the bill.   Beers were cold and fresh, the only redeeming quality.   If you bought me dinner here I would refuse. There must be better places to spend $25 on a Monday night.",

Monday night the home team (Baltimore Ravens) played the New England Patriots. I started watching the game ... first 2 quarters at Applebee's. It was a dreadful game watching experience. I left, on my drive home I said ... Man, let me give Half Moon a try. I wanted beer and wings!   I'm soooo glad I did! I ordered the Im wings grilled, 1 beer and because I checked in on Yelp I was able to get a free slice of cheesecake.   Sometime next month I plan to host a happy hour for my Meetup group on the patio area. They have a pretty big patio actually. It wraps around the building, has a fire pit and plenty of seating. I'll definitely come back really soon with my Meetup group",

I ordered the Chicago Combo (Italian Beef w/ a Italian Sausage on a roll) with Sweet peppers.. got it with the spicy peppers. At this point I just wanted to get out of there.. so handed over my card.. took a good 10 minutes for the waitress to bring it back.. and my debit card was broken. She snapped the corner off.   So in short.. if you have a few hours to kill, want poor service, and food that really isn't all that good.. this is the place for you.

    "text": "I was looking for somewhere to host a business meeting for an alumnae group. I need to seat about 20 people and was working off of a very minimal budget. After doing some research on Yelp and calling around to a few places, I decided to go with Half Moon. I've never been here before so I was a little weary about it in the back of my mind because their reviews were just average.  However, I'm very happy with the way the event went and with their service. Their Platinum room was pretty spacious. It can probably fit as most around 35 people. There is one large screen in the room and several flat screens. The room was free to rent and they required no down payment (huge bonus!). We had a PowerPoint presentation that we wanted to display and had brought the wrong cable. Luckily, someone (the manager?) helped us out and located the right cable for us, what a life saver!   I ordered about $50 worth of food during Happy Hour and it was the perfect amount to feed 20 guests, some who came straight from work and didn't have dinner yet. We had one waitress assisting us but that's all we needed. She was very quick and efficient. The food was pretty good for bar food, nothing spectacular, maybe a little on the pricey side too. I ordered off of their starter menu and got some wings.  While the room is private, it was still pretty loud. I understand that there was Football going on so they were pretty packed. I would keep this in mind as you're booking the room. If you're looking for something quieter, this may not be your place.  The parking situation is kind of a bummer. I arrived at 6 and the lot closest to them was full. I finally figured out where their other lot is and parked there. It's a little bit of a walk though. They're tucked away in between all these office buildings so the parking is pretty strict too.  I don't live near this area so I don't see myself really coming back but I had a great experience and appreciate their hospitality.",

There are tvs absolutely everywhere: Up behind the bar, over by all the tables, above the pool table, in the back rooms and outside on the patio. That means I can literally watch football from wherever it is I am either sitting or standing. Can it get any better? Oh, well yes, it can. Their wings are just out of this world delicious and finger licking good. I always get them crispy and lightly dipped in the sweet chili sauce. It is spicy and kinda tangy just like I like them. If you don't order them crispy though, they come out a bit underdone in my opinion. I have found that it is just easier to tell them exactly how I like them instead of expecting them to figure it out. that way I am happy and in turn they are as well.

The crust had some sort of weird seasoning. It was so bad, we didn't even finish the whole \"small\" pizza. To top it off the margarita I order, while huge, lacked alcohol.

I used to be a Hostess and understand when places get busy.  This place wasn't that busy...they were very unorganized for a Sports Bar for first game of the football season.   We decided to come here to watch opening night of football.  It was just about time for kickoff and I had to go tell them to change the channel from the NFL Network (which is what they thought the game was on) to NBC.  They were great about that.    Here's where it gets bad...When we first got there, we joined a group of friends who had been there a little earlier to wish a co-worker farewell.  The service at the point of our arrival was bad.  The waitress barely took our drink orders, and we asked to add another table for more room.  They agreed to add the table but we were the ones that had to move the table because they started to ignore us.  The other people in our group were ready to order food and more drinks, and the waitress pretty much ignored our waving her down or she was avoiding eye contact as she walked by several times.  She would come to the table and help one person and not ask if anyone needed anything and if you tried toThis was the worst service experience I have had in a long time.  We came here to watch the Opening Night of Football.  It wasn't really busy when we got there.  Just as it was about kickoff time, stop her for someone else at the table, she just kept on walking.    We had another person join our table and she order a drink along with a couple of other people who had been waiting for some time to place another drink order.  We also order appetizers at this time...Chips and Salsa and Zucchini sticks.  About 20 minutes passed and we had the bartender apologize to us because the service was bad...making excuses that didn't make sense for a sports bar on opening night of football.  They finally brought the drinks and said they would have to remake our food (again...chips and salsa and zucchini sticks).    Another friend joined our group (others had also departed) and asked for a water (again...waitress only asked the new comer what they wanted to drink).  People were waiting to order another round of drinks at this point.  We were still waiting for our appetizers (they had come out with stale chips and Calamari instead of zucchini (sent it back)).  Told the manager that we were not happy with the food and she apologized and said she would comp it.    We said enough was enough.  We finally flagged down our waitress, who had copped an attitude with us (she wasn't on good terms with her other big table as well), to tell her we wanted our checks.  After about ten minutes, she came back all happy and told us that everything had been comped.  We all got up and left.  This was all before half time of the game.  We proceeded to go to Zipps just down the street where we had service 150% better than this place.    I am sure the Manager wasn't happy because she not only comped our table, she comped the other table that wasn't happy with the waitress and attitude as well.  This was a chance for them to prove this would be a good Thursday night football place to stop at near work and they failed miserably.  I wouldn't recommend going here if you are interested in having great service while you enjoy a game.",

    "text": "Where to begin.  1. There is an absolutely horrible smell once you walk in.  One of extremely dirty and stale water.  It's throughout the entire restaurant.  Sitting outside in the heat was better.  2. Service is just bad.  The bartender- whatever her name is- very standoffish.  Seemed that if you weren't a regular you didn't matter. She told us to sit wherever- took us going back inside 10 minutes later to get a server.  Server was nice, but didn't pay much attention to us.. 3. Beer- Dos XX was flat- got a big blue van and tasted better but still weird.  4. Food.  Wings were good but i would probably order them well done next time. They were just barely considered fully cooked.  Carrots came out dry as can be.  Nachos had good flavor but came out cold to the point where the cheese was already coagulating by the time it got to us.   Overall just not a good experience and not worth nearly puking due to the smell or spending your money.",

The food itself isn't anything special. The burger was pretty average and the chicken fingers honestly weren't what I expected. The breading on the chicken fingers was different than I was used to, but it became soggy pretty quickly.  The environment is like a Midwest bar with games like darts, shuffleboard, and pool. In addition, if you're looking to catch a sports game, this is the place to go because they have so many TV's everywhere!!!",

Today my friend and I ordered 24 wings with 4 different flavors. Unfortunately, When it came out, we only got 2 of the flavors: honey chipotle and spicy. The spicy was EXTREMELY spicy and I could not finish it! The honey chipotle was decent and had a nice kick to it. Fortunately our waitress was able to give us 6 wings of 1 more Flavor to try: Korean bbq. This one was my favorite sauce and I recommend it if you are ordering Wings! Another friend had a side of coleslaw that was inedible! He is vegetarian and said it smelled of fish! When we asked the waitress about it, she said it is \"Chicago style coleslaw\" so it tastes different from regular cole slaw and that many people have complained about it. Why havnt the chefs changed the recipe if so many have complained ?!   All in all, half moon is a good location for drinks and watching a sports game, but the food can use some improvement.",

The staff is very attentive and friendly, the establishment is conveniently located south of the Town and Country complex, parking is no problem, and of course there are more than enough TV screens for sports fans.  This is definitely one sports bar I'd recommend to friends for viewing sports and enjoying drinks and good bar food at reasonable prices - especially if they enjoy dining, drinking, and socializing in a patio, as this has one of the better and more spacious sports bar patio spaces in the city.",

We sat at the bar, I ordered some wings (cant get enough of half moons wings) and my fiance ordered a burger and a side of wings. WINGS WERE PERFECT. My fiance didn't like the bun as much on the burger but it was still pretty good.  I really like the change up of this bar, I loved the environment and the way everything flows.  The best part about this visit was probably the bartender, her name was Alexandra. Because of her my fiance and I stayed at least an hour past the time we intended on leaving. She did a damn good job getting my fiance drunk and we had a blast with her.  Very outgoing girl and the customers around me seemed to think the same.  We will 100% be back on a regular basis!",

They fell off the wall and thought the waitress should given them more shots. Seems to me this group needed to be cut off. Management should have stepped in and made them leave.

OK,OK, I admit I found my self thinking that my reaction was a bit snobby (maybe it's my age....?) but yuck, who wants to yell over the televisions to talk to the person next to you?? I'm tellin' ya, they are loud.   Food-wise, I should have stuck to typical bar food and maybe I would have had better luck, because the big pretzel was tasty; traditional chewy with coarse salt. The salad with tri-tips was a dissappointment...actually the salad part was fine - fresh romaine and avocado, but the tri-tip was dry and tough and the balsamic dressing on the side was an overly-sweet, gelatinous blob (truly weird). As the hubby pointed out, what was I thinking ordering salad at a sports bar??   If you are really looking to watch TV sports and drink beer... I guess this place would be fine. For LUNCH...waaaay better choices out here.",

So now we have three guys, two girls, and a three year old.  There is hardly anyone else in the bar, and we still had to walk up to the bar to get service. Annoying.  We got tired of the pool table and lack of service so we went to the bar to close out. This place charges $15 to rent the billiard balls. Are you effing kidding me??? In an empty bar, you are going to charge people to stay and hang out for a bit to play some pool? If the bartender had told us it was going to cost $15 we would have left. Two stars, only because the food was decent.",

Started with some Chi-fries from the menu. Great taste; great starter.   I chased it with the Godfather Angus burger. If you're doing Chi-fries I'd recommend switching the fries that comes with the burger to a side salad or comparable. I requested the burger well done. It had a nice, smoky taste to it, which went really well with the Italian beef and peppers.   Highly recommend. If I'm ever back in this area, I would certainly keep this on the list.",

I ordered a beer and a pizza: sausage, mushroom, onion, green pepper, it was a combination THEY made up and close to what I would order on a pizza.  When the pizza came, all I could see was the sausage.  The bartender/mgr actually showed me a minuscule piece of mushroom and onion.  Wait, what?  YOU HAVE TO SHOW ME PIECES OF MUSHROOM AND ONION TO SHOW THEY ARE ON THE PIZZA?  I don't think any real Italians would have any more patience than did I in this instance.  Waste of time.  A complete waste of time.  If I rule out Half Moon, and I have, that leaves me with 547 other sports bars who, at least at this point, won't wast my time.  One last thing: the entire restaurant is a homage to Chicago sports.  Fine.  Really cool stuff, actually.  But the name is not remotely Chicago.  \"Half-Moon\" doesn't say Michael Jordan in any way.  What's up with that?",

The Italian sausage sandwich was something I could have made myself and the pizza had a great crust but was nothing to write home about. We also ordered the pretzel fondue and the calamari. The pretzels were great but the cheese was thin and gritty. Not sure what cheese they used but it tasted horrible like it came from a can. The calamari was by far the worst. When the menu said it was hand sliced I was really excited but, WOW was I fooled. Bad calamari can be dry and rubbery. This calamari wasn't even close to being that \"good\". When the waitress came back to ask how things were I said I'm not sure what this is but its not good (calamari). She LITERALLY said yeah, I know, sorry. Then walked away!!! She could have cared less that we were not satisfied. I will come back and sit at the bar because it's close and the drinks were good (Bloody Mary was really good) and the lady next to me had a burger that looked awesome so I will try that but other than that this place will never rank high in my visit list.

It's located in the middle of Phoenix somewhere and is a pretty cool bar/restaurant.  I saddled up to the bar and ordered an IPA to get started on Happy Hour and then we ordered these items for $5 each (happy hour pricing):  1/2 Medium, 1/2 Sweet BBQ Wings <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/half-moon-sports-grill-phoenix-2?select=YXKrnuDpFyhAm2af4eTg5g#YXKrnuDpFyhAm2af4eTg5g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/half...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/half-moon-sports-grill-phoenix-2?select=Yj_9ysSNU7HcjcCiovTYqQ#Yj_9ysSNU7HcjcCiovTYqQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/half...</a>  Sausage & Pepperoni Pizza <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/half-moon-sports-grill-phoenix-2?select=8ehj7xtOySrjAzCV8S0PaA#8ehj7xtOySrjAzCV8S0PaA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/half...</a>  At the recommendation of the bartender, we split between the Medium and Sweet BBQ Wings....he was spot on...both were awesome!  I preferred the Sweet BBQ Wings between the 2.  The Sausage and Pepperoni Pizza was good as well...not great, but good.  This place is pretty impressive.  The bar is fairly large and was busy on the night we went. They have a large patio area and could easily handle large groups.  Plenty of TV's in the bar area for sports.  There's also a large dining room area.    Overall, we had fun hanging out here for 1 night.  However, it's too far away for us to be regulars here.  But if we're in the area, this will definitely be on our list of possible joints to visit.  Return Factor - 80%",

I was greeted at the door and told to find my way to the patio since it was busy for the Blackhawks game. Server comes 5 minutes later; ask for a menu? She returns 10 minutes after that. Try to order beer #1 - oh. Sorry, we don't have that. (Pet peeve when it gets to two beers that are not available anymore). Okay, order my second option. She returns 10 minutes later and goes on her way. Order the chicken strips with ranch and honey mustard the next time she finds her way back outside. 20 minutes later a random person comes out to each table - did you order chicken strips? No? Did you? No? Four tables later she gets it right. Do we not put tickets on our food to know where it goes? Because this has been happening for every table that ordered food out here on the patio.  (Dear Half Moon, if you are serving finger food, make your servers bring some damn napkins). Oh, and they forgot the honey mustard. Then, I'm left alone for 30 minutes. Girl comes back to ask if I want more. Nope, but I'll take beer option #3. Oh, sorry, we don't have that. But we do have this and you know, rotating handles. OK, but seriously! Print different paper beer lists if you can't keep the same taps on for long periods of time - it is not hard. There are plenty of good sports bars around here that figured that shit out already. Ask for a water and my check. Water comes after 10 minutes and tastes like pool water. As I write this, I am still waiting on my check. Maybe she got lost.  Sorry, Half Moon, your being a Chicago bar is not enough to bring me back. Get more servers for busy nights, or at least get one or two with some hustle.",

My husband had the triple decker club which was good, and my son had the kids pizza which was also good. There was really nothing bad about the experience just nothing great. Maybe we were just too used to the old menu (and fries) that it's hard getting used to the newer items. Overall our experience was good. Our server was very friendly and even the host was nice enough to offer to pull down then shades so we could sit outside which I thought was very nice. If you're a sports fan, this is definitely the place you want to be on game day but parents be warned, it's very LOUD on big game days. So I wouldn't recommend bringing very young children when a big sporting event is happening. Otherwise this place is very child friendly.",

    "text": "Came here with some co-workers.  Wanted something else besides my usual salad. I opted for the Prime Rib Sliders...they were not good.  They were cold and when I told the bartender he set them right back.  So the customer service was great, but even warm they were just not good.  Definately not worth the $16.00 plus tip I had to pay.  Guess I will have to stick to salads if I go back, at least that is suppose to be cold :)",

    "text": "I guess this is one of the better sports bars in the Biltmore area but I still think it misses something... the bar is a great place to watch a game, but the main dining room lacks seats so that everyone can see the game.  While there are lots of TV's they tend to be on one wall so only half the table can see them...  The fat tire and Pyramid everyday beer special is great and the pictures on the walls are awesome... the food is decent... but I still think there could be more...  PS... the video in the bathroom is hilarious!!!",

    "text": "I love the theme of this place and think it could definitely be a national chain.  I use to go up to the north Phoenix location back in the day for their cheap Long Island Ice teas and great food, and all their big screen TV's to watch all the games on.  The service at this location is great but the food is not what it is at their northern location and I think it is a little pricier because they are so close to the Biltmore. They also don't have the Long Islands!!  In any event if you want to have a chill place to watch the game I would definitely advise going here for drinks.   Would probably opt out on the food...they are a bit off if you have eaten at any of there other locations.",

    "text": "Just watched PART of the World Series Game.  Food was definately down hill from a year ago.  Beer was not cold and staff mentioned that changes were made to make the restaurant more profitable.  BUT, we the customers suffer... bad business plan.  Went to a competitor just north at the  Colonnade  and was blown away fridgid beer, great food and better prices.  My half moon chicken sandwich tasted like microwave frozen unseasoned garbage.  Then to top it off the order of fries was cold, small and probably out of the freezer as well.   I WAS A FAN, BUT NEVER AGAIN!!!",
