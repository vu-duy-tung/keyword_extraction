We also ordered a few sides beer battered onion rings and stuffed jalapeno poppers. I really like the onion rings, they had a nice beer flavor, even being a little soggy. The poppers were ok nothing really stood out about them. I will be back to explore more of their delicious combinations on their fresh dutch crunch bread.  I am a fan!!",

I asked the cashier and she told me the popular one is \"sometimes I'm a vegetarian\" but I ordered Pirates of the Caribbean instead, which included vegan chicken, orange glaze and pepper jack cheese. I like it, but it would've been better if it was spicier. I like that they have sourdough bread as an option, and unfortunately I didn't notice their 1/2 sandwich special until after I ordered, so I'll have to come back to get that or come to their happy hour 4-7pm everyday and all day Sunday. Pretty cool place and there's something for everyone. The staff was nice as well. Good location in the brickyard at ASU and hope they continue doing well. Ps they have halal chicken and the only pork they serve is their bacon. Even the ham is made from turkey.",

    "text": "As a couple others have already pointed out, this is a chain based in San Francisco, not a local business - but still definitely a neat and tasty sandwich shop.  I've been twice. The first time, the cashier took a couple minutes to walk me through the menu and make recommendations. I had a Sundevil (American cheese, fried chicken, and spicy sauce) on sourdough (they'd run out of Dutch Crunch for the day). Good chicken, good bread, good sauce... all around, a pretty good experience. The second time, I got a bacon and egg sandwich on Dutch Crunch. I'm a sucker for all things breakfast, and not at all hard to please; that said, I thought this was a pretty good sandwich too. Bread was rich and crunchy, bacon was plentiful... the egg was a little rubbery, but not bad.  The only thing that might keep me from returning is the price. Most sandwiches will run you about $10 (a bit less for a half), and while they're definitely good, I'm undecided about whether they're $10 worth of good.",

There were lots of people inside, & I was waiting with a few other customers for them to open. After waiting for ten minutes in 100 degrees, we were all extremely uncomfortable & overheated. At 11:05, their door was still locked & but someone did come out to take our orders. She did not unlock the door or offer any of us water. It is now past 11:15 & nothing has changed, only there are about ten people sweating outside with us now. I just really wish that Ike's could have taken the few minutes it takes to open their doors & let us cool off while they're playing catch-up. Living in Arizona, keeping us outside is pretty inhumane, all ten of us are still out here & it's been 20 minutes since they were supposed to open.",

Every option is very unique and the portions are large enough for 2 meals. if you go during happy hour you get free chips and drink if you eat in. Other wise dont both buying the chips or drink.

Everything is great here and I'll be making this my go to sandwich place next time I'm in Tempe. It's off the beaten path but there is a sign off of Mill so it is not too hard to find.  What do I order when I'm at a Ike's?? It's the Jaime Syrich. My personal favorite. Fried chicken sandwich. It's super good. Also the Tony soprano is really good.

I ended up buying some extra sandwiches and taking them home with me. My family gobbled it all up and kept asking for more. I don't know what else they do to those sandwiches, but the garlic/buttery taste on top of a perfectly crisp sandwich is to die for!

    "text": "I dragged my feet on checking this place out because I was thinking it's just a sandwich; no big deal. I was SO wrong!  I checked out their website ahead of time, which has a \"vegan\" tab for each Ike's location, so I was already familiar with some of the vegan offerings.  But when I arrived, there were so many more options jumping out a me. Luckily, the employees know their stuff when it comes to their vegan menu, and they were able to answer my questions.  I ordered the Handsome Owl (sans cheese): vegan chicken, teriyaki, Wasabi Mayo, lettuce, onions, pickles, & banana peppers, on Ike's World Famous Dutch Crunch bread. OMG! I don't know what sorcery they used to conjure up that bread's amazing and unique flavor, but it is phenomenal! The combinations of all the flavors that encompass the sandwich is ingenious.  My mind is blown. It's a $10 sandwich, but it's huge, filling, and worth every single penny.  I will certainly return to try all of the vegan combinations.   They sell Zapp's potato chips, which come in a variety of colorfully named flavors, like \"Voodoo Heat,\" \"Hotter'N Hot Jalapeno,\"Sweet Creole Onion,\" etc.  Looking at the ingredients on the bags (and I have since checked Zapp's website), it appears that only the Salt & Vinegar, and BBQ Ranch chips are not vegan (they contain a milk product), and all except the Mesquite BBQ are gluten-free. However, the source of the natural smoke flavor and \"natural flavor\" needs to be confirmed.  I also spotted MSG in at least one flavor.  I tried the Hotter'N Hot Jalapeno chips. I wasn't impressed. 0 heat. Not 1 hint of spice. And the taste was a little off; almost on the stale side, but the bag showed a November expiration date. Not sure what that was about. Next time I'll try a different flavor to see if there's any change.   Management informed me of the following:  50% of the veggie sandwiches can be made vegan upon request.  They use Daiya for the vegan cheese, Tofurkey for the vegan turkey, and Gardein for the vegan chicken and meatballs.  All of their breads are vegan except for the wheat (it's honey wheat). The wasabi mayo is automatically vegan, so no need to request a vegan version. Their Dirty sauce is not vegan, but they offer a vegan version, (which is delicious, btw! Add it to your sandwich, or get it on the side and dip your sandwich in it. YUM!) Fries (called \"Air Fries\") are vegan; they are baked, not fried. Tater tots are vegan.   Not vegan: pesto, & honey mustard sauces, the fried foods, like onion rings & beer battered zucchini (egg based batter), and the obvious (meats and non-vegan cheeses).  CORRECTION: Their Sun-Devil (a nod to Arizona State University/ ASU) is not vegan, & they do NOT have a vegan version. (The photo I added is actually their vegan Dirty sauce.)  Their veggie bacon is vegetarian; not vegan  Gluten-free bread available upon request.  I love the way it's decorated. It has a very warm, happy, and welcoming vibe. Friendly and vegan-knowledgable employees. Fountain drinks or bottled drinks available. Open late (until midnight) on Fri/Sat. There are few outside tables. Located in the heart of Tempe, next to the Bank of America off Mill, between 6th & 7th. Typical downtown Tempe street or paid lot parking.  SANDWICHES = MIND BLOWN!",

I don't particularly like this location because they have a storefront but it's always closed so you have to go to the order out window and sit outside. I've been there in the summer so it's been super hot outside. Don't know if they are renovating but everything looks good inside so not sure why it's not open. I ordered Pirates of the Caribbean and it was really good. Always order on Dutch crunch bread and they make a vegan version of their dirty sauce and will even give you a blow pop instead of a caramel apple lollipop if you tell them you're vegan. Love Ike's and that it's expanding. Can't wait for the indoor seating to be available at this spot. Highly recommend, my favorite sandwich spot.",

FREAKING AMAZING buffalo chicken, ranch, amazing jalapeno poppers all stuffed in the most amazing bread ever called the Dutch Crunch or something like that. The bread alone is incredible and is nice and crunchy yet pretty much melts in your mouth.   I can't wait to get back there and try something else!",

    "text": "We had gone to Mill Avenue and were walking around when we saw a couple of people from Ike's who were serving sample sandwich bites. My boyfriend & I each got one & thought they were absolutely delicious so we decided to go in for lunch. Ike himself was there! He was really nice and talked to us for quite a while.  After a look over the menu, we got the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian sandwich. It had grilled mushrooms, artichokes, cheese, and pesto. The sandwich was massive, and even though we shared it, both of us were full. My only complaint was that I don't typically care for artichokes but it was a little bit annoying that they had put whole pieces of them in the sandwich. The best part was definitely the pesto sauce and their house bread! It was fantastic.  I had sampled another sandwich called the Menage A Trois. It was also really tasty, and I'd definitely recommend that if you're looking for something that isn't vegetarian. Although I'm not vegetarian, I really liked the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian sandwich & thought the name was really clever for that very reason.  Ike's is a bit on the expensive side, however, it's great sandwich place if you're on Milll Ave! I'd recommend splitting a sandwich with someone if you go. I'll definitely be back!",

They even have sandwiches that include mozzarella cheese sticks layered right in! I'm a big fan of their 'normal' turkey, bacon and swiss or tuna sandwiches. The Sun Devil sauce is amazing and be sure to take advantage of the free extra add in's i.e. onion, mustard, etc. I personally order my sandwich on the sourdough, but I've heard good things about the Dutch crunch along with their normal wheat and white. I had to deduct a star because it's really hard find a parking spot in the area without having to pay to park.",

As an aspiring vegan, it can be pretty difficult to find satisfying, hearty meals that fit my dietary restrictions. I'm a sucker for a good sub, but that almost always requires some form of meat, cheese, or dairy/egg-based sauce. NO LONGER, MY FRIENDS.   Ike's has sooo many vegan options (or vegetarian which can be turned vegan). And they are so chock full of goodness that you don't feel like you're depriving yourself. Everything on their menu is very well-labeled too so you know exactly what you're getting when you order.   I chose the Sometimes-I'm-A-Vegetarian (ain't that the truth) and altered it to be vegan (took off the cheese). It. Was. Delicious. Their bread is probably the best part--super thick and somehow both crunchy and doughy. The sandwiches are huge, so you really get your money's worth.   The staff was so friendly, I wish I could recall the name of my cashier because he was really great and helpful in offering suggestions. We came in 10 minutes to close and I didn't feel like we were being rushed out.   'Would definitely visit again, way better than any chain sandwich store I've tasted. Oh, and the complimentary sucker with your order is a fancy touch too.",

I'm so glad I don't have to wait to visit San Fran to try these delicious sandwiches, since they have recently expanded to Phoenix. My first time here was at Yelp Community Event, where we were able to have a tasting menu of 4 different sandwiches. This was perfect for first timers as there's so many options to choose from. I chose from an experimental tasting menu, and my husband had the spicy tasting menu, so we were able to taste 8 different sandwiches all together. Every sandwich we tried was delicious. It's really hard to pick a favorite, the highlights were a buffalo chicken style sandwich, the Mozzarella's Big Cheese which had chicken and honey on it, the Carne Asada fries sandwich (which included just that) and the dessert sandwich of nutella and marshmallow fluff. There's a ton of substitutions available along with vegetarian and vegan options, and their bread is fresh as it's par-baked daily and then baked to order. The staff here is really passionate about their food and extremely nice and helpful. I will definitely return for Ike's amazing sandwiches.",

    "text": "Thanks to Yelp, we tried Ike's today and was not disappointed.  Not only was the staff incredibly helpful but they suggested great sandwiches! The sandwiches were huge and the voodoo chips were so yummy (never had a flavored chip that good before). Had we known how big the sandwiches were, we would not have ordered fries and onion rings....though they were fantastic! Make sure to get their crunch bread, it was fantastic and different from anything I have ever had! This is now our favorite sandwich stop and we can't wait to go again.  On a side note, we met Ike and he was very charming.  He took the time to talk with us and even let us snap a picture! So nice to meet the man behind the food and see how genuine he is. Fingers crossed for an Ike's in Gilbert next!",

Last week visited with daughters and I ordered the Madison Bumgarner w/tomatoes on Dutch Crunchy bread.  It was fantastic, really.  Had a stack of napkins in front of me when I was done, wiped my mouth with every bite.  The yellow bbq sauce was so good, complimented the meat perfectly.  Every time I go to Ike's I stare at the menu until the very last second before ordering, so many great sandwiches from which to choose.  Best sandwich shop in Tempe, for sure.",

    "text": "Maybe I visited on an off night? My Dutch Crunch bread had the right texture, maybe a little flat but nothing to complain about. The taste however...unsalted slightly stale plain crackers. I had the Bella because of some good reviews, but the chicken was a texture less tasteless pile of mush. Well it did have one taste. That kind of gamey chicken taste - just a touch. I probably wouldn't have noticed it if the sandwich had had *any* other flavor to it. Ate half - threw the other half. Just wasn't worth eating.   I also had the onion rings. Breading was fine, but again not much flavor and no salt. They were also slightly burnt (black spots) on the outside.  Normally with a food review like that I'd give 2 stars (I reserve 1 star for food poisoning), but the place was clean, I like the format, the menu is impressive, and I'll probably try it again since all these reviews can't be wrong...can they??",

Their version of a turkey rueben is solid as well. And the dutch crunch bread is worth whatever calories are in it and more - and this is about the only place in AZ where I've seen this bread. I would highly recommend Ike's. It's hard to find in the back of the Brickyard on Mill, but don't let that stop you.",

Why is it I continue to find these great little nuggets around the Tempe area??  Every time I visit here, I keep finding these amazing local little places serving up incredibly delicious eats!!  And dear God...Ike's is quite possibly one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten!!!   No lie.    So I must add...the three young kids (youn adults...forgive me) working at Ike's tonight we're beyond incredible...in fact, let's just call them awesome.  They all, and I mean all three of them added a bit of warmth and sincerity to my experience - something you just don't see very often...(right Aldo?). Lol  Anyway...Ike - please give these kids a raise!!  Well, not to assume you're not paying them well- just recognize that you are very blessed to have such an enthusiastic and creative crew of workers.  I really can't get over at how frigg'en friendly and helpful they here to me tonight...seriously.  They came out from behind the counter, went over the menu with me, made solid suggestions but only after qualifying me (again, another anomaly) and then, they all did their part making me this amazing amazing work of art - wow. I'm so mad at myself for not getting their names - they truly need to be recognized!!  They were just great kids - period!    I went with a homegrown half pastrami and half turkey sandwich on their French Roll...one side was dressed with their god father sauce and the other had this garlic aioli...both extremely yummy and All homemade of course.  A little tomato and onion and trust me, this ship just found its harbor...into the belly it went!  I'm stuffed, I'm happy, my belly hurts cause I ate waaaaaay too much but again, I'm very very very happy!!  That was a great sandwich - thank you Baby Jesus...  This is the type of sandwich and experience that one just doesn't get very often, or ever...for that matter - I can't wait to go back!!!    Please open one in New Mexico!!  Please??",

I still could say that it could have used a little more meat. But other than that, it was good. The fries were good too but not sure if it was $5 worth of good.

The only thing I can say that needs improvement would be updating the summer hours on the website. This location closes at 10pm through the summer. So we just barely made it in time to order our food. Thankfully the staff was super nice and we were able have some dinner.",

    "text": "I sat on this review overnight, and the more I think about it, the more I am bummed out about my visit last night.    I had heard mostly good things of this place, and had wanted to try it out for quite some time. The main draw was the Dutch crunch bread.  You never see that type of bread outside of Northern CA for the most part.  My buddy Sean has a joint up in South San Francisco (Darby Dan's) that he took me to a couple of times, and I fell in love with the Dutch crunch bread.  Not sure why its not used more often!  Anyways.... My friends from Northern CA always hyped Ike's and you would swear that it was the greatest sandwich of all time.  Um, about that........  I drove down to Tempe (Was going to a concert at Yucca Tap Room later that night) and decided to stop into Ike's.  I was kind of unfamiliar with the area, so I drove around the block once and finally found parking (underground garage, $1.00 for each 20 minutes).  I walked upstairs from the garage and the entrance to Ike's was right there.  I walked in and right away, I noticed a familiar face.  It was Ike himself!  He was chatting it up with a guy for a good 5 minutes.    I stood there and looked at the menu for a bit.  It's a tad overwhelming!  The cashier was friendly enough and pointed me to a list on the wall of their \"Top 10 sandwiches\".  My buddy had told me to get the Menage a Trois (Halal bbq chicken type sandwich), but I wasn't in the mood for shredded chicken.  I finally decided on the \"Pat Tillman\" on Dutch crunch bread.  I placed my order, got a cup for water, and sat down.  It took awhile for my sandwich to come out.  Once it did arrive, here is how it was...............  The Pat Tillman-  This sandwich consisted of roast beef, sauteed mushrooms and mozzarella sticks.  Sounded pretty damn good, and I figured that for my first time here, go with an Arizona original (RIP Pat Tillman!).  I added lettuce and tomato to the sandwich but skipped any kind of \"sauce\" (I had seen pictures of their sandwiches and they are drenched in sauce...I knew I wouldn't like it with that much goop on it, so I got it without).  I unwrapped my sandwich and the first thing I noticed was that it was a tad skimp.  It may have been 10 inches long, but it was not \"fat\".  For $10.80 after tax, I wanted something a little bit larger.  I took a bite and it tasted alright.  The Dutch crunch bread was fantastic.  That was by far and away the best part of the sandwich!  Crispy and crunchy on top, soft in the middle.  Really great bread!  The inner guts of the sandwich were skimp though!  It had maybe 4 ounces of roast beef, 3 mozzarella sticks, and a tiny amount of mushrooms.  The lettuce and tomato filled it up a little bit, but they key ingredients were definitely lacking!  Totally not worth almost $11.00!  I wasn't even that hungry and I finished the sandwich with ease.  After I was done, I was on my way.  About that...............  One of the reasons that I was not that impressed was the lack of caring.  The cashier was friendly enough, but was still kind of monotone and not too upbeat.  Seemed like he was just going through the motions.  It also kind of turned me off that Ike didn't say anything to anybody in the place.  He was sitting at a table on his laptop doing some work, but still....he could have stood up and walked over to the 4 of us eating in the restaurant and asked how our sandwich was, or at least said hello, or thank you for coming in or \"hope to see you soon\" or whatever.  When I was done with my sandwich, I walked up to the cashier to throw away my wrapper, walked right past Ike, and made it to the door without either one of them saying anything.  I know that may seem trivial to some, and it may sound like I'm complaining over some petty shit, but it still would have made my experience way better if I felt \"valued\".  Hell...they are probably printing money at this joint, and don't have to do a damn thing to retain customers (Thank you Arizona State and young college students!), but I sure do like to go to businesses that actually care that you are there.    I don't think I am ever coming back.  It's too far away from my house, the sandwich was decent, but not \"good\", and the price of it was way too high for what you get!  I'm glad I tried it, but even if I lived close by, I couldn't justify returning because of the price and lack of main ingredients. Not bad enough for a 1 star review, but definitely a 2 star \"Meh, I've experienced better\".  Much, much better.........",

For a vegetarian/vegan, the selection of sandwiches are amazing. I love that they are able to have mock meat on their menu - though I'm not certain that they make their own mock meat. I have had multiple sandwiches on their menu, but the meatball sub is always my go to.  This particular location has an interesting set up w/ friendly and efficient staff. It's very warehousey - the tables most often need a good sweep/wipe down before we sit down to eat. I've never had to wait more than 7-8 minutes for my order. The last time we visited, we had the turkey/cranberry sandwich and the tots. Sandwich was ace as always, but we only got 6-7 tots...I was thinking that it would be a lot more considering they give a lot more fries in previous visits.   They also forgot to give me my caramel pop - they always forget my caramel pop...even when they ask if I want it and put it on the order...",

But some how Ike's manages to overcome my biases and eek out a good scoring review.  The main reason I am a \"fan\" is due to the large vegetarian options and are more than a salad on bread or cheese on bread sandwich. I also apreicate having a unique dutch bread option and the free candy apple lolly at the end.  I have tried two subs, the first was the vegetarian meatball sub. It had fake meat some kind of creamy sauce and lettuce, it worked, for $10 I then had to go back to work.  I also tried the pilgrim which had tofurkey and cranberry sauce. Again the mix of flavors and textures worked.  They have some impressive sounding sides, but due to the prices they do not seem to get ordered much.",

First, it was really hard to find them and when I called to ask how to get there, the person on the phone informed me they did not know how to explain where exactly they were located. Second, some of the meat on the sandwiches we ordered tasted like it was frozen and them warmed up when we ordered the food. Through taste of frozen or reheated meat is no appetizing, but that was not the case on all the sandwiches. Everything else was delicious and I would have given them five stars if it was not for these two hiccups!",

I ordered my Cain Velasquez with avocado - cause I'm from Cali and that's just how we roll; don't sleep on these sandwiches folks; they're pretty amazing! I was in Heaven because they sell Zapp's potato chips, Key Lime and Cream Soda. Took me back to all those vacations in Nawlins when I'd pig out on catfish & shrimp po-boys and Zapp's. Made me feel right at home.   Not sure how I paid $18 for a Sammy & some chips...but the sandwiches must be made with crack...so, I'll be back tomorrow for the Menage A Trois (BBQ Sauce, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, Swiss) or Adam Richman (Avocado, Fried Chicken, Ham, Pesto, Real Honey, Swiss).  These are some of the best sandwiches ever! I just wish we had Ike's in San Diego:(",

Everyone and I mean every single person every time I go in there is just so friendly and warm and exuding a love for their job. They chat with you about your day, make sure you leave happy and are just awesome to be around. Now the food itself is great too - the sandwiches are a monster size so i usually would go for the lunch combos which are a half sammy with chips and a drink on the cheap. Every single sandwich is amazing, espeically if you get it on the Dutch bread - hello crunchy factor to raise up the sandwich bread game!   Try these guys out, you'll love it if you're in the mood for sandwiches...and LOVE-ly people :)",

Was super pumped to find this in Arizona. It's in a fantastic location.   It's a little overwhelming going there for the first time because there are so many options to choose from. Ultimately, I chose the Bear sandwich after asking the worker a million questions and prioritizing my favorite sandwich fillings. The Bear was freakin amazing and I can see why people are obsessed with this place. The sandwich had jalapeno poppers, jalapenos, prime rib, garlic aioli (dirty sauce), mushrooms, Baked french fries, served on Dutch crunch bread.  We went during happy hour so we got free chips and a drink...so that was an added bonus. I definitely recommend this place--friendly and fast service, decent prices for a ton of food, and a fun atmosphere. Probably best for lunch though.",

We went in for a (very) late dinner and were instantly greeted by a dauntingly expansive menu and extra-helpful staff.   I was wearing a shirt from the Vegan Food Fest and the employee immediately asked me if I had dietary restrictions. I love when restaurants have lots of vegetarian/vegan options available!   I ended up getting the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian (artichokes, grilled mushroom, pesto, provolone) on the Dutch crunch bread. Sandwich was very good and I loved the texture of the bread! If there had been a better ratio between the veggies and sauce, I would've given it 5 stars. There was scant pesto, but a lot of of mayo/sauce/something mayo-based. I'm not a mayo fan (I think they call it \"dirty sauce\") and there was WAY too much of it. My boyfriend got the Jeremy Stoppleman (breaded eggplant, grilled tomato, habanero salsa, pesto, provolone). He gave his four stars as well. His complaints were too much mayo and not enough toppings. Next time we'll be sure to ask for no sauce. :)   Our sandwiches also came with caramel apple suckers (which were actually delicious, haha).   Overall, the service was outstanding and the food was good. We'll be back for sure!",

    "text": "Because I like to eat relatively bigger meals when going out (as well as whenever I eat), I enjoy this place's variety. I usually get the almost 30$ sandwich known as The Kryptonite on their famous dutch crunch bread because it has virtually every ingredient on it including the various meats, mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, avocado, pesto... I mean come on, it's ridiculous but great. It actually comes as two separately wrapped sandwiches ('krypto' written on one wrapper and 'knight', 'night', or 'nite' on the other) that I end up saving one of for the next day. The workers usually verify that I'm ordering the correct thing because I guess its not commonly ordered (as workers shout to each other, \"we've got a kryptonite!\"). \"You want the almost $30 dollar sandwich?!\" Yes, yes I do. See you soon my beautifully tasty, filling sandwich.",

By far my favorite thing was the fried zucchini with pesto dipping sauce.  The zucchini was perfectly fried deliciousness and the pesto was fresh and wonderful.  The girls at the register were friendly, but they did miss a couple of special requests we made.  In their defense, we were new to Ike's and asking lots of questions.  The mistakes in our order weren't bad enough to complain about or send back the food.  Ultimately, the reason I'm rating Ike's 4 stars and not 5 is price.  We felt it was a bit pricey for sandwiches, although they are huge.  Two people could easily split one.  So if you're a penny pintcher like me, bring a friend and share a sandwich.",

There are more than 500 different options on the menu, but for your convenience, they have their few best listed on a menu board. The chicken in their sandwiches are halal and there are tons of vegetarian options. I had the privilege of meeting Ike himself and he was such a boss haha! Amazing guy and so down to earth. I don't know if I've ever seen the owner himself work in the kitchen before. The happy hour from 4-7 pm gives you free chips and a drink with your sandwich.   My favorite sandwiches are MILF, menange a trois, Phil Mickleson, and the Reuben. So so so good.",

The location is somewhat hidden away behind the Bank of America ATM but I did a see a sign on Mill Ave to direct people there. I would have to agree with other people in that the sandwiches here are delicious! I'm not sure if I would consider them to be the best but they're definitely up there. So far I had the Menage A Trois and Steve Nash and they have been phenomenal. Somehow I'm not able to stray away from the Halal chicken just yet but the other sandwiches sound really good as well so I'll definitely have to give them a try sometime.  While I really enjoyed the sandwiches here and would give them an easy 5 star rating there are some minor issues about the restaurant. I just wish that the seating area was bigger and the tables that are used are just too small. In any case I will still come back here as the sandwiches are really good. Definitely one of the best spots on Mill Ave by far.",

When I got there I was totally overwhelmed with all the options so I just went to the counter, told them what I was looking for, and the found the exact sandwich I wanted. It happened to be on a menu from one of their other locations, but they are able to make just about anything you could want. As a vegetarian, it's difficult to find any place that's overwhelming with veggie options, so this was honestly a breath of fresh air. I initially thought it was a little bit pricey, but once I got the sandwich and saw just how big it was, the price definitely seemed fair. So my only advice would be to only go when you're really hungry, 'cause you're about to get more food than you can handle.  I'll be back next time I'm around Mill!",

It took only a few minutes and our two massive sandwiches were ready (note to self-there are some half sandwiches for next time).  The sandwiches were nicely toasted and very tasty.

I particularly wanted to check out this specific location out because of the amazing sounding Jeremy Stoppleman sandwich that they have on the menu. I dropped by around 6:30 pm on a Friday and grabbed the Jeremy Stoppleman (breaded eggplant, green pesto, grilled tomato, provolone, and habanero) with an order of the beer battered mozzarella sticks. Now, the sandwich itself was super delicious. The dutch crunch bread always satisfies my carb craving and the eggplant + pesto + habanero combo was amazing. I would definitely drive out to Tempe just to get the same exact sandwich again. The mozzarella sticks though were a bit disappointing, particularly for the price. One order only comes with 4 sticks and they honestly don't taste all that special so I'd really recommend passing on that unless you just really cannot live without mozzarella sticks. The cashier who I interacted with was super friendly and helpful and it was a great experience overall. Definitely a place to check out if you want delicious meat/veggie/vegan sandwiches with some interesting twists!",

Although it was yummy I feel like it needed something to really complete it to make it stellar- possibly a delicious creamy/savory spread... I would definitely revisit when I'm on that side of town. Oh and you get a lollipop too but unfortunately for me it was not vegan  (caramel apple) oh well.",

Upon first entering its a little overwhelming with the number of sandwich combinations but I loved the chill and fun vibes.  I opted for the Lynda Carter sandwich but decided to add tomatoes and switch the French dressing out for dirty sauce. I figure anything called dirty sauce had to taste good.  The sandwich overall was delicious. I loved the crunch of the eggplant and of course I was right with the dirty sauce being absolutely magical. The serving size is huge too. I wasn't even able to eat the whole thing. Now I just wish I had one of these near me!",

I got the Sundevil on dutch crunch bread, but it was drowning in so much sauce that within a few minutes of carrying my sandwich out, the bread was sopping and my fried chicken was just a mess of sogginess. It was also so salty with all the sauce that I ended up picking out the chicken and throwing the rest away. Maybe I got a fluke sandwich, but at $10 I'm not sure I'd take the chance again.",

We love you, you're beautiful, it's True. Can't wait to try something different next time, maybe the ASU Sundevil or one of the veggie choices.  P.S. These sandwiches are huge, big enough to share or get two meals out of. I also love that they have unique sodas, like butterscotch or real cola and Voodoo flavored chips. Plus, you get a caramel apple pop with your sandwich, brilliant! I wish more companies believed in such a unique motto. Be silly, be nice and don't be afraid to be different. They have cute sayings in all the napkin holders, like \"tell someone they're beautiful\" and on the door \"to our lovely customers.......\". I live my life in this sweet, karmic sort of way and believe that even the smallest things, like these, can make someone's day. Kindness is contagious and can make or break any experience. Marcus knows what's up.  To Ike and the staff, never change. Love, peace and silly geese.",

There are so many different sandwich options with a number of sandwiches named after ASU and Arizona sports figures along with several SF Giants and other actors/athletes. It takes a few minutes for the food to come out, but well worth the wait. The last time I was there I ran into Ike himself who was kind enough to chat for a few minutes, take a picture, and hook me up with a free drink/chips coupon for my next visit. Which will be very soon.",

    "text": "These sandwiches are SO GOOD.  They are huge and savory and filling.  It is difficult to stop at eating \"just half,\" for your tastebuds and tummy want the whole darn thing.  I ordered the Meatless Mike sandwich (vegan meatballs) and wow, those meatballs tasted better than \"real\" meatballs.  The bread was also great: fresh, soft where it had to be soft and just enough resistance in places to make you work for your food.  I also really liked the marinara sauce which is actually making my mouth water RIGHT NOW.  Some people may quibble about the slightly higher-than-expected sandwich prices (mine was $9.99 for something akin to a Subway footlong), but the quality of the ingredients, bread, and fantastic customer service are all worth the extra money.  You also get a caramel apple lollipop with your sandwich, which is da (sugar) bomb.  ;)  Check out Ike's for some serious sandwich magic.",

Huge selection of sandwiches that can cater to anyone whether carnivore or vegetarian. The sauces are original and interesting and the house bread for the sandwiches was soft with a nice crunchy crust. Small dining area so may need to eat your sandwich somewhere else.  Only downside was they messed up the order a little and i think there should have  been more meat on my sandwich. Had the Madison Bumgarner and i thought it was a little skimpy for an $11 sandwich. Would definitely try again.",

When trying this location for the first time I was hoping that they were able to replicate the Ike's food and service I was familiar with. They hit it spot on! Everything from the diverse menu to the friendly service, they even replicated the flavor perfectly. Every sandwich is slathered in Ike's specialty sandwich spread dubbed \"dirty sauce\" which really makes for a unique flavor. The Dutch Crunch bread is another Ike's specialty and cannot be passed up.",

My go to order is a Pilgrim with Extra Dirty, Lettuce Tomato, and Mozzarella sticks. You'll want to get he Voodoo chips if you want a tangy flavor to contrast with your sandwich. I love Ike's selection but what most people don't know is that their menu is much longer. They have something like 200 different ones on their website. My only wish for this location is a Binder in which I can sort through other sandwiches like we had in the store I used to work at.

Ike's is a chain of higher end deli sandwich shops that prides itself on using fresh, fine ingredients. This location is conveniently placed in downtown Tempe, steps from many bars and hotels. I placed an order for pickup, and the order was packed and ready to go when I arrived. I claimed my free bag of chips (they have Zapp's which are awesome!) with Yelp check in, and walked back to my hotel.  I got the vegan Pilgrim, which was delicious. I recommend their signature Dutch crunch bread, which is a fantastic freshly baked crusty sourdough. The flavorful combination of thinly sliced vegan turkey, sweet cranberry sauce, and a spicy kick of Sriracha were balanced perfectly by fresh lettuce and tomato. The only downside was that the fillings were skimpy, especially at $10/sandwich-the bread and lettuce to other fillings ratio was way off. My boyfriend got the Damon Bruce and did not enjoy it, for the same reason. They also did not include the extra pickles and mustard that we requested. Regardless, I still recommend Ike's and appreciate their multitude of vegan options.",

    "text": "I tried Ike's for the first time during Temple's Art Festival earlier this year. They were outside giving out samples. I sampled the Menage a trois, the MILF and the Barry Bonds sandwiches. They were all to die for. I promised to check them out again for the real experience the next time I was in Tempe.   That time came this past Saturday. Undecided on dinner I knew I wanted a Slickables ice cream sandwich. \"Sandwich\" made me want a real sandwich so to Ike's we went. My boyfriend ordered the Menage a Trois (Halel chicken, BBQ sauce, honey, Swiss and pepper jack cheese).  I ordered the Tony Soprano (ham, turkey, salami, provolone and Italian dressing). We both had our sandwiches on the whole wheat. The whole wheat rolls are soft, kinda sweet and divine!!   In our bags were 2 little extra surprises, 2 green apples and caramel lollipops. What a treat! I already have a whole list of sandwiches I'm dying to try:   The Julius Cesar, The Matt Cain, The Paul Reuben, and the Steph #CurryOne   Til next time Ike's",

I have tried their sandwich combinations ( without cheese) and tried telling them exactly what I want on it but both were made wrong either missing an item or had the cheese left on it.  This last time my husband went and ordered and brought it home. So it's not just me.  I have given them more chances since I have been to the mill location and never had the issue.  This location is a big fail. Sorry Ike!!!!!",

The spice level was just right, and combination of the meat and sauces was perfect. The size of most sandwiches here is around 8\", and they can serve them in a wide variety of breads. The only problem that one may face at this location is the parking, it may be a challenge on a weekend evening during the busy times at Mill Ave. Highly recommended place, and I'll definitely be back to try many more sandwiches here!",

I also loved that they've kept the menu consistent with the SF location, which made me a little homesick in a good way.  The service was friendly and quick, however, I had gotten my sandwich to-go and didn't open it until I got back to the office. I was heartbroken to see they had forgotten to put the BBQ sauce on my Menage A Trois :( Our office was 15min away so I couldn't go back to correct it. The sandwich was unfortunately pretty bland without that BBQ punch I had been anticipating.",

I ordered the MILF, adding fried chicken instead of halal chicken, on a Dutch crunch roll. Got a Thanksgiving on gluten free bread. for my beloved wife.   Our dinner arrived in about six mins, hot and fresh. We didn't eat until we got home but it was still plenty warm. The bread was soft yet crusty on the outside and the fillings were plentiful. The poppers were a nice addition to the fried chicken. Loved my choice. My wife said she thought I had gotten her regular bread instead of GF cuz it was so yummy.   I will be returning to Ike's, especially since learning about several locations throughout the valley.",

If you aren't starving - split it with a friend, the portions are huge, that or do what I did and eat the whole thing, but just be in a food coma the rest of the afternoon  3. Get dutch crunch for the bread.  4. don't throw away your bag before checking to see if they didn't throw in some surprise lollipop inside, you'll be said when you've tossed yours and your friend's are enjoying their surprise candy dessert",

I ordered the Matt Cain, which has turkey, roast beef, and salami.  3 kinds of meat so I'm thinking it's going to be loaded.  I was wrong.  Not only that but it was pretty sloppy, meaning the meat tended to squish out of the opposite end that I was biting into.    I'm not deducting points for this but I believe I noticed another reviewer point out that Ike's is a \"local establishment\".  Sorry to burst your bubble but this place is a chain from the Bay Area in case the names of the menu items had not tipped you off.",

Amazing to find that one of San Francisco's BeSt sandwich shops has not only expanded throughout Northern California, but found a home not far from the ASU Campus...  Okay, when I first stepped into the Ike's on 16th Street in the City, I didn't.  I actually stood in line OUTSIDE the small shop for a while before ordering.  Yes, it's THAT popular.    And when I did, i fell in love with the menu.  Sandwiches with fun names, some silly, some famous.    I ordered for our group :  Barry Z., Barry B., and a Lincecum!!!,  I ask you, how could I not love a place that names sandwiches after iconic SF Giants players?    Flash forward a few years.  Here we are in Arizona to visit family AND watch the World Series together.  Wouldn't it be great to have some yummy San Francisco treat?  I'm not talking Rice-A-Roni...  Low and behold, Ike's has a shop on Mills Avenue.  I got to meet Chase, the person bringing this little piece of sandwich heaven to Tempe.  What a nice young man.  Instant adoration since we were both sporting our Giants gear. Too fun.  And when my order proved too big for me to carry, he helped me out to my car.  Great service!  I do hope this shop becomes very successful.  The sandwiches are very Yum.  Too many to describe.  Check out their website for sandwich descriptions and know that no matter what the location, they make ANY sandwich on all of their menus....    Next time we are in Tempe, we will be back.   And of course during Spring Training, when we are in town to cheer on our Giants!  I fully expect to wait in line, once the locals and college kids discover this new treasure....",

Due to this, there was a pretty crazy line, but it was well worth the wait.  The staff was really nice! They were patient with questions and even rewrapped subs when we didn't finish. The man himself Ike was there and he was so friendly! Even though busy, he chatted with us for a bit, telling us his favorites.  Drawn to the uniqueness, I got the Bear Hug. It was so yummy! Just the right amount of spice and creaminess. I would definitely recommend it, but with so many options, you can't go wrong!  Parking is always a drag on Mill, but there is also a location nearby in Mesa for those wanting to avoid this.",

Great place for plant based diet and meat eaters . They have super tasty fries. I couldn't believe it that they sold Vernors out of all things Vernors! I never see that anywhere so the fact that they have it really boosted them up on my list. Anyways I go here pretty often and I love that they have later hours in the downtown area to snatch up a delicious bite when you got those night time munchies. The staff was great as well.

I never thought a sandwich could be 5 stars, but I've been proven wrong.  They have a menu of over 100 different sandwich varieties, and you can also do substitutions, etc. to totally customize your sandwich. And no don't compare it to Subway because it's so much better.   I don't remember the name of the sandwich I ordered because there's so many to remember, but it was breaded eggplant, marinara, jalapenos, onion, tomatoes, and mozzarella sticks added inside. I think I may have also added pesto, but not too sure. Whatever it was, it was delicious. Make sure to get Dutch crunch bread!  I don't think you could go wrong with any of their sandwiches. If nothing on the menu fits exactly what you want, just do a substitution. And for vegetarians, there's an entire menu for you! Very few sandwich shops do a good job at veggie sandwiches, so I appreciated that.",

I opted for lettuce, tomatoes, and jalapenos too (toppings are free).   Lots of bread options, including a sourdough sub!   Total came to about $14 dollars, definitely a steep price for a sub.   It's a great place for veg heads to indulge a little. The portions are so big that the price isn't a huge deterrent for me, especially since they offer unique variety!",

This was fine, they were able to make me a fresh sandwich of my actual order (the spiffy tiffy).   I originally wanted to give this place 5 stars as I normally would, but this time it was very hard to give more than 1. The quality of the food has really declined at this location. I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but my sandwich, the spiffy tiffy, was lacking in flavor and was super greasy (left me super bloated).

    "text": "Not sure if my waistline is thrilled but I personally am stoked that Ike's is slowly getting closer to me (next stop, Scottsdale!?).   I stand by my statement that I had the best sandwich I've ever eaten here. It's hidden on Mill and located right behind the wine bar and *ahem*, they have a great happy hour!  Here's how the experience works. This is a casual sandwich eatery where you can come in solo, order and take it to go, or dine in with a couple friends. Anything goes at Ike's. Now, when you walk in, you'll immediately be overwhelmed by a board listing off a variety of every sandwich combo imaginable and it's not your run of the mill sandwich combo. No way. It's a combo of everything good in life that's put in between two slices of bread and served either hot or cold, depending on your sandwich. I suggest looking at Yelp reviews, pictures and the menu before you arrive to avoid major menu anxiety like I experienced. Also, note that every sandwich has a hilariously funky name so you might get lost in translation just simply reading the names!  Once you've made your sandwich selection, you'll order at the counter from one of the incredibly friendly staff and they are truly genuinely friendly! It was such a breath of fresh air to experience a sandwich at Ike's. The decor is just as fun and funky as the staff and sandwich choices and be sure to look on your napkin holder because it will tell you something pretty about you!  Now on to the best part, the sandwich. I don't even know where to begin. First, they serve this special bread that typically can only be found in N. Cal and it's amazing. Cheese is baked into the bread. I tried the Bella which is their most popular and I'm not surprised. It's a combo of chicken that has been slow-cooked for several hours and then tossed in this delicious honey mustard. Then they top it with cheese, avocado and this special mayo spread. I suggest adding some hot sauce to it. It's served hot and it is large and in charge, so unless you're ready for a last supper meal you will probably have some left-overs or your might want to share. It's worth every single calorie consumed and then some.",

Sandwiches are not normally something I get to have (celiac sucks), so when I can I love them. They had so many options - I really do recommend checking the website first and deciding what you want. It took us a long time looking at the board to choose. The space is very small - definitely better for take out (they also deliver which is nice). Our cashier was very helpful in assisting us in our sandwich choice. Turns out he was celiac too, so I was comfortable with his assurances that cross contamination with normal bread is minimal (and I didn't get sick - huge bonus!). We will definitely be back here, and often!",

I've had the pirates of the Caribbean, sometimes I'm a vegetarian (the pesto is delicious) and I think it was called the little mermaid or something like that (it was just shredded chicken, orange glaze and cheese). The vegetarian ones were better. The sandwiches are a bit pricey. Be prepared to spend more than $8 for your sandwich. I'd suggest going there during happy hour so you get your drink and chips free if you want those.   I'd go more often if it was cheaper but it's close to campus and they have Zapps chips. The employees are also really friendly and helpful.",

The variety of meatless protein options (lots of fake meats) is great, though, and the Dutch crunch can be very good.",

The portions are ENORMOUS, I'm a big fella and can only eat half of a sandwich, thankfully they are delicious heated up the next day, and if you go during happy hour you get free chips and a drink with you sandwich, dope.      I discovered Ike's on Sunday, came back again Monday, and fully intend to try to convince my wife to go again today (Tuesday). You are missing out if you have not been to Ike's yet. Seriously",

I live by the location on Mill and always eat at the one downtown on First Friday's-both locations always deliver the same delicious sandwich which is why I keep coming back. If you don't want to wait in line for your sandwich you can always order in advance on Yelp, which is what I do because parking on Mill is terrible.

I ordered my food and then the guy who took my order went back to make the sandwiches. He didn't take my friends order for another 5 min which was weird because when we looked inside if it was maybe busy there was no one there but us. Then another girl came and took my friends order. We then waited, I kid you not, 25 minutes for the two sandwiches . There was no one else there but us. I kept peeking in to see what the staff was doing and they were doing nothing and on top of that there was at least 6 people back there. I was super hungry and getting to that hangry point. I even asked a few times how much longer it would be along the way. They kept saying you're up next, but up next to who, no one else was there. Eventually we got our food after a long wait.   So some of you may be wondering why give this place 3 stars still. Well because despite the wait the food was so good as usual. I wish I could say I'll come back to this location but most likely not because it was an irritating experience.",

The vegetarian options looked especially intriguing. The Dutch crunch bread was really yummy, but not that crunchy once it soaks up all the sauce. I liked it better than jimmy johns bread. The sauces are pretty tasty but I have no idea what's actually in them because there's no descriptions of them. The dirty sauce kind of seemed like a thick garlicky aioli, more like a spread than a sauce. The sandwiches are also huge, especially when you add toppings like lettuce and tomato, and I was so full afterward. Wouldn't come with a big group because there isn't much seating. Definitely want to come back and try more!",

I stopped in the Mill Ave store to get a quick bite before a show at Gammage. I brought my friend who was new to Ike's because I insist on spreading his sandwich gospel.  I decided to get the ASU-exclusive Kate Spade with added avocado. The Sundevil sauce is delicious, kind of a kicky ketchup/BBQ taste. Service was good too.  Our cashier helped my newbie friend navigate the menu with his recommendations.   Pro tip- Ike's makes a great breakfast the next morning if you pop the 2nd half of your sandwich in a toaster oven for 10-15 minutes.",

The \"world-famous\" Dutch crunch is more chew than crunch, the first half of the Dutch Crunch was good but began to be too much,  Other bread options are French, sourdough, whole wheat and gluten-free.Will try the sourdough next time.  The menu is huge and the worker helped decide what to order and recommend.  The Tempe location is small with about 6 tables but the kitchen is massive, it took a little longer than expected to make the sandwiches.  I ordered the Cain Velasquez,which had bacon pastrami and swiss, the meat was generous and the sandwich was loaded. I could only eat half the sandwich.   I will definitely come back again but try the other breads.",

We were wondering around until we see the sign...which is still rather small and rear and you'd probably miss it.   Food=    Good taste Wait=     Not too good, it's too long, but the wait is worth it!! Price=    Tricky due to it ain't cheap to begin, and yet, you don't think twice cause it's just too   good to have.   The sandwich is one of those NYers style where the ingredient is all there; nothing like the subways.  The kitchen is very transparent as you see the whole process from the side of the restaurant.  The menu can be confusing as you just have to go through one by one to know what the heck you're getting yourself into...a treat, or a hella good treat that is...  Onion ring is pretty weird...good taste for the first few bites then it gets kinda saggy and not interesting.  But definitely not the one they serve from fastfood chains.  Final verdict....get yourself extra cash, because good food sometimes ain't cheap, and get some different ones to try it out with Ike's.",

When my boyfriend and I went to pay the cashier told my boyfriend that \"Ike had paid for our meal. He came and told me and I was confused but then I noticed the cartoons of Ike on the walls and it made sense. The employee offering samples was Ike! After we received our food we thanked him for our free food and had a small conversation. I haven't had such great customer service in a long time and it just makes me loves this place even more!",

    "text": "Giving this a 4...but...the reason I stopped in was for their world famous Dutch crunch bread.  I've only had it one other place (Palm Springs), so I was very excited.  However...at noon-ish on a Monday, after I ordered, I was informed they were out of the bread.  How does that happen?!  So moving on...I got the Reggie Jackson...it was awesome!  Even on plain old wheat bread.  Full disclosure:  they did give me a coupon for my next stop in because of the bread situation.  Overall, huge menu selection, friendly service...just get the bread in!!!",

One sticker shock its $5(not worth it) but second, it's a nice size portion(not $5 worth size) but still.. Overall, cool concept and great food and atmosphere.",

    "text": "I went on a search for a deli that had Dutch Crunch bread and failed about 2 years ago.  I recently went to Monterey and went to Ike's out there and it was so good, I was telling everyone about the Dutch Crunch that they were missing out on in Arizona.  One person did a search and thankfully found that Ike's opened up in AZ!  So naturally I had to take a peek for myself.  The sandwich was by far the best deli sandwich I've had in Arizona, AND they actually have Dutch Crunch bread!  The bread was a bit different from Northern California Dutch Crunch, but it was close enough for me.  The ingredients they use are also way better than what most delis use.  It's a bit pricey but totally worth it!",

    "text": "It's a part of my job to pick up incentives for ASU so one of the incentives I had to pick up was from here. Then I saw the menu. and OMG IT'S HUGE. Upon seeing it I decided to come back the next day when I got paid. I got the Love Triangle and it was delicious. The staff was really friendly but it took almost twenty minutes to get my sandwich. So that's one draw back since I was the only one there. I say if you eat here take it to go because the dining room is really small. People are saying it's expensive but I think it's worth it for the giant sandwich you get. Almost every sandwich could be made vegetarian if you want too. Good Options and Good food. I will definitely be back. Probably not on lunch break though, it's too far to walk in the arizona sun XD",

    "text": "I went to this place with high expectations, maybe a little too high because I was let down big time. The sandwich didn't have a lot a meat, it was loaded down mostly with lettuce and their dirty sauce which was coming out of every side of the sandwich so didn't matter what kind of meat you got in your sandwich everything taste like dirty sauce. The meat was along the lines of a subway as far as quality and was overpriced. The customer service is great and that's why I'm leaving a 2 star instead of a 1 but I will never go back with sandwich places like Firehouse Subs around. I'm more into quality than quantity.",
