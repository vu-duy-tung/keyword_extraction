    "text": "Visiting this fun Arcadia bar is like spending with rich college kids with bikes; everyone is young, well dressed and your select hangout locale looks trendy and cool. On the other hand drunken debauchery, bro dudes donning tank tops and faux hawks, squealing and fireball shots by the dozen seemed to prevail, no one had a care in the world. Did I mention it was 6:30?   The Little Woody isn't hard to find if you look to the NE corner of Indian School and the side street (42nd place). Just pull down the side street when you see the neon bird eyes commanding you stop to have a drink. The bar is dark, covered in REAL wood cross sections and cozy. You can order food or play skee ball, darts or shuffleboard. There is no outside area so it's not ideal for smokers, but great when it's either a zillion degrees outside or pouring (like that ever happens). The bartenders were attentive and prompt. Overall, a great little neighborhood bar that's a fun stop on your Arcadia bar tour.",

The people who camer here the night I was there were hipsters who were more into caual and convo than a club or a dark sports bar.

Restrooms were clean and shuffleboard was well maintained. Looking for a small dive and feel without the skunky smell. This is your place.",

I like it here because there is no signage from the street.   Once you park in the lot and enter through the back door you'll find yourself in a pretty small, low lit bar. The walls are adorned with wooden logs, hence the name. Keeping with the tradition of The Vig and The Vig uptown, the place has a cool vibe and they play good music. When i got there it was standing room only, so despite the obscurity from the front, a lot of people know about it. There is communal long table in the center, some booths and another area with some couches to lounge.  This would be a great place to come on a double date or a small group of friends and cozy up in one of the booths and have a few cocktails or beers. I can't wait until winter because it will be a great place to hit when it's chilly outside.",

The place is small and has two rooms.  The front room has the bar and a lounge area.  If you go around the bar, you'll find the back room that has shuffle board, skee-ball and darts.  The games always have people playing them, but you can just put a quarter down and be next to play.  There are a few tvs, but the games are where the fun is in this bar.  LW has a small food menu, but I've not eaten here... boyfriend says the flatbread is super good though.  The bathrooms can be a joke if the place is busy, and the bartenders may cut you in line if they have to go (happened to me)...  Oh!  And at a certain time of night the music goes up to an insane decibel of loudness.  Loud loud.  As in I got so tired of shouting at the person next to me, I just quit talking.",

The vibe and ambiance can fit almost any occasion from a casual drink with friends, a romantic date night or a night out solo to belly up to the bar, make new friends and chat up the bartenders.   The staff are friendly and attentive, their menu is simple but unique.  They have tempting pub food options worthy of a quality gastropub and offer a full-bar but I highly recommend trying any one of their signature drinks on the menu.    I can't wait to go back...",

One room (the main one you walk into) is your stereotypical standing bar with table, booths, etc for noshing, drinking and socializing.  The back room, though, is where the magic is.  The back room is basically an adults arcade.  There is skeeball (you can win prizes if you rock at it), shuffleboard, darts and fooseball.  It's a great way to meet new people (everyone loves a little friendly competition) and keeps the atmosphere light and amiable!    I only knocked down the place by 1-star because it can get a bit overcrowded there on the weekends, but other than that one issue, Little Woody is definitely a place I recommend to check out for a good cocktail and some fun!",

    "text": "Oh my goodness, The Little Woody. Shenanigans abound here. During the week this is a great place to find a $5 draft (or even a $2 canned stout*). They make a mean Moscow Mule too. I've met some of the most interesting people here from all walks of life. (Note that the age range drops to more of a college crown late Friday/Saturday.) Yes, there is a hipster vibe with a plethora of guys wearing plaid. But who cares? It's fun here!  Bar service is available everywhere. No worry if you're not seated right by the bartender. The employees will hustle out to take orders. Alex is *freaking* hysterical. Ask for a demo of what he can do with a towel. The modest need not.  Try not to drive too fast for your first visit. The building is brown with a small-ish neon owl out front. From the back parking lot it's not really clear either if you've arrived. (Note: The parking lot is a very safe place to leave your car. Plenty of folks do as The Little Woody is keen to roll you into a cab. At closing cabs are lined up.)   Be sure to scope out the back game room.  I had been going for more than a year before I realized there was even fun behind the bar. D'oh!   * The Two Dollar Beer *  Short story. They have a chalk board which usually lists the available beers. The other night I noticed a section for cans. Always on the lookout to try a new beer I said, \"I'll take the Vinifera thing.\" A stout is a close as I can get during the summer months to a porter, so Yes Please!   When ferried to my table I plopped down a $5 bill as I thought it was $4. (Which is crazy bananas cheap.) My jaw dropped when three dollars were returned as change. Yup. If you're a fan of dark beers check try Vinifera Stout! (7.5%). It was like drinking chocolate.   Right. So this is a great place!",

I stepped in to be greeted with dim, red light, freezing A/C, and Miike Snow blaring from the ceiling, and then I knew this would be a sweet spot.   Okay, yes, it's a little hipster with the faux old-fashioned themes to their cocktails. They love their whiskeys, and it shows when everyone orders a Manhattan with garnished with a lone, giant ice cube. You could feel thrifty and order the \"Codger\" as well, with a shot of who-knows-what and a can of Old Style for $5. The beer selection features quality IPAs, such as Modus Hoperandi from Ska Brewing.   The bartenders have a bias toward bitter. I heart bitter, but I don't like whiskey. I saw a bit of tequila there too, but their selection doesn't appear too eclectic.   In the back is a narrow room with shuffleboard, foosball...and even ski-ball! Oh gosh, I love that, even though after a few my balls might derail and ricochet elsewhere. :-x  Overall, this place is stylish, comfortable, and has a good selection. I especially like the huge, communal table in the center that looks like it would be perfect for beer pong.   If they don't let me play, it's still cool. I'm gonna bring some friends here.",

I turned to Yelp for suggestions and went to 2 or 3 bars before I actually ordered a drink at Little Woody. The other bars just didn't have the vibe I was after.  Little Woody was cool as it was a little hidden and was playing some good music when I walked in. It's a small place so the 20 or so people that were here made it seem busy.  Bartender cooked me up a custom Oban-based cocktail. It was a little pricey at $13 compared to their $8 cocktails on the menu, but I have expensive tastes so oh well. It was pretty damned tasty, and I always appreciate an off-menu custom-crafted cocktail.  I have a feeling I'll be back again next time I'm in AZ.",

My husband and I came for after-dinner drinks with two friends living in Phoenix, at the recommendation of another local. It was pretty ideal in every way.  The vibe was relaxed and kind of hipster, which is a quality I've come to appreciate in Phoenix. I loved the decor--there was an owl motif and the walls were covered in little cross-sections of wood, like a wallpaper made of coasters. There were games like darts and skeeball, which we didn't play, but enjoyed in theory. Instead we plonked down at a comfortable table--readily available at 9:30 on a Saturday--and enjoyed a couple rounds of drinks.  I had two cocktails, and both were excellent. The Beeting was delicious, refreshing and smooth with a flavorful dose of beet--made with Hendrick's gin, St. Germain, fresh lemon, beet puree, and ginger syrup muddled with cucumber and basil. The Rhubarb Rye Old Fashioned was a great take on a classic, a mix of Templeton rye and rhubarb bitters with muddled orange, Amarena cherry, and a sugar cube. Top shelf  liquor with balanced, thoughtful preparations.  Service was also fantastic. Our server Amanda was super friendly and attentive, even when the bar filled up toward the end of our visit. She even defaulted to splitting our checks, something that never happens in L.A. I expect to come back to Phoenix at some point next year, and I'll plan to stop by The Little Woody again while I'm there.",

When you see an all state building pull into the parking lot and you'll see a little wooden owl- that is the entrance to this hidden Arcadia gem- that could so quickly be any one's favorite bar. This place is dark, when I think about it I remember red accent lights and a wall made of chopped wood, but it still had more of a loungey bar vibe, than a lodge ( which is what i think of when I see tons of chopped wood) Next, the bartenders are SO knowledgeable. They taught my fiance and I how to truly do a whisky flight. They also made some awesome recommendations and truly crafted a tasty, deep, quality craft cocktail- probably one of the better old fashions I have had since moving to Phoenix-metro area. They have darts, pool table, a great whisky selection, knowledgeable and friendly staff and just a cool, underground type vibe.  Part of me doesn't even want to post this review, because I want to keep it my own little secret! But alas, I'll let you yelpers know so you can experience the secret coolness of this place :)  Cheers, friends.",

    "text": "HA ha ha HA ha HA ha ha HA ha he he he he he he he he he....... (Woody Woodpecker)  For those of you old enough to know the Woody Woodpecker this place is a like an homage to the character.   The only way you'll find this gem is by catching the eyes of the woodpecker off Indian School Rd.  At first sight you wouldn't think much of this place from the outside.  Once you enter it's a nice cozy chill atmosphere.  I'm glad this place is here far from the party scene of S. Scottsdale.  Everyone seems pretty relaxed and open.  They're not here to impress anyone; they're here to have a good time.  The place in general is covered in \"wood\" and has a cabin look.  Thus, the \"woody\" part makes sense.    Moving, past the main doors and towards the back and going West of the building is the game room.  Tad bit odd for a lounge, but totally awesome.  Shuffle boards, skeet ball and darts in the back room while you have a drink with your best buds in case you didn't want to just sit around at the bar.  The large LCD TVs shows the game of the night while you sit back and enjoy.   The Woody also serves up some cozy comfort food.  My buddy and I ordered the tomato soup with grilled cheese sandwich.  I wasn't too awed about the sandwich, but the toast on it made sense to my palate as I dipped it into the roasted tomato soup.  The soup was delicious!  I pounded it down with a couple of drinks and my night was complete! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "During my great Phoenix booze search in the fall of  2012, I turned to my trusty Yelp friends on Talk and proposed the question: Where is the best place to go for a good selection of whiskeys at a decent price. I got many useful responses, but Marsella M. hit the nail right on the head when she suggested The Little Woody. I never heard of the place and it was close to my home so I was intrigued. I checked it out one night after work and had some trouble finding the place since there are no signs. I figured out where it was when I saw the neon owl in the window. As you walk up to the door you don't know what to expect and it feels like you are going into the back entrance of a restaurant. Upon opening the door though, you are immediately greeted by a cool relaxed lounge, perfectly decorated and welcoming.   This is an all around great bar and I might rank it as my favorite in Phoenix now. It has all the elements to make it a great place for a drink and some food. 1) It's hidden, so you have to be in the know to find it. 2) Great bartenders, drinks, and specials 3) Very cool and modern decor 4) There are two separate rooms, each with a different vibe. The main room with the bar has couches, a long high top, and booths. The back room has some great games, including skee ball, darts, foosball table, and I think a pinball machine. Great overall set up for whatever you're in the mood to do.  Also... Plenty of whiskey flights to choose from. On Mondays they get new drinks for the patrons to try out. Lots of Four Peaks beers. Their house special is called The Codger: $5 for a can of Old Style and a shot of Old Grand Dad.   This place had the Review of the Day yesterday on Yelp, so it seems the secret is out and I'm sure more and more people will start flocking to Phoenix's best secret bar.   Ya know what, this place stinks. Don't go here ever...unless you already do, then you can still go. Otherwise, it isn't worth your time. Seriously. Just go to Buffalo Wild Wings.",

Hidden in broad daylight right off of Indian School and 44th street, the only thing that shows you it's there is the owl (their logo) light in the window. You'll be greeted by an old gentleman who will let you into the parking lot and then you enter through a door into a windowless bar. Sounds shady right? Well, it's just shady enough to make it a little exclusive! You certainly wouldn't drive by it and decide to stop by. You have to know about it.   This bar is trendy divey at its finest. Logs wallpaper the walls, and the lighting is dim. There's plenty of seating either at high top tables or booths. The bar has plenty of seating as well. But the best part is the back room. The back room is filled with fun games! Games that include skeeball, shuffle board and darts! If only they had air hockey and big buck hunt. It provides a fun atmosphere and one that's chill. This bar is well put together and well kept, but still holds on to the divey feel...without beer stained floors!   PS - they also own The Westerner that just opened in Old Town.",

Small and always happening on weekends, this isn't the place to be if you suffer from claustrophobia because it's jam-packed nuts to butts in here. So here's what you do.  Make up some stupendous bullshit about how you scheduled your bunion surgery for Friday afternoon and need to take off work after lunch...then head to the Little Woody for pre-game. Hang here till the place starts to fill, then bounce around six.  There's a bar across the street on the second floor, I can't remember it's name. They serve giant hamburgers. I know this because some middle-aged guy trying to scam on a girl half his age ordered one and had it split. She didn't eat it because she was all, \"What'd you order that for...I don't eat red meat.\"   Of course she doesn't. But I do. So I winked at the guy and he slid her plate my way.  It was a good half burger. When I was numb, I went downstairs to La Fontanella to eat a bunch of Italian food.   Anyways, oh yeah, The Little Woody is fun when you can have it all to yourself. Otherwise, get ready to do battle with the chick next to you, hoping to get the bartender's attention. Good luck. As if he's going to notice you when her thong is hiked up to her ear lobes and she's wearing a low cut top.  Don't forget to limp into work Monday and remember, you've got ten toes. The bunion thing should get you well into the winter months before having to come up with a new Friday afternoon affliction.",

You can only find it if you already know it's there - they've since added a red, glowing owl sign, but before that the only clue to this bar was the Jameson barrel placed outside the back entrance. On the weekdays, it's got a really relaxed, speak easy feel. It's full of the young professional, after work crowd (happy hour is every day from 4 to 6). Since it's been getting more popular, the weekends are pretty crowded with a mixed bag of people. Either way, this place is a fun time and full of activities.   What activities, you say?  Board games and jenga hidden inside the bench seats, two skeeball machines that spit out free drink tickets when you get a high score, and foosball and shuffleboard. Every Third Wednesday they have speakeasy sessions of live acoustic with local artists. Every month they have a skeeball tournament to win prizes (like a growler full of beer).  This place is great and you should definitely check it out.",

The bartender was not interested in serving us and was borderline unfriendly. I ordered two Moscow Mules and she never acknowledged that she heard my order. When she made them I said I didn't mean to be high maintenance but I thought they made mules in copper mugs. We like that they the mugs don't let the ice melt and keep your drink colder. Also, when I'm paying $9 for drinks I expect them to be better than the $3 ones I buy on Mill Avenue. She told me that they don't do copper mugs on weekends because they get stolen. I've been to the TLW many times on Weekends and that has never been the case. I've also seen a sign in the past charging ppl If they don't get the mug back. When we went back to the game room I counted about 4 other copper mugs on tables and realized the bartender was jut being lazy. At the end of the day I don't really care about the copper mug, I do care about bad service and seeing a place that I enjoy begin operating like a bar that is based on slinging drinks as fast as you can for drunk people. Hopefully this place will turn around but with as many new, fun bars popping up in the area it won't be that hard to choose a different spot for our date nights.",

    "text": "When I first showed up at the woody, I noticed there was an extreme arbitrage opportunity.  I guess not in the True sense, as I didn't really make a profit off of these people, but what I'm trying to say is that they'll give you an old style and a shot of old grand dad whiskey for $5 (It's called the Codger).  That's 2 drinks people.  Yeah, they taste like complete shit....who cares, that's part of the fun.  The challenge, if you choose to accept it, is to get hammered for next to nothing.  They dare you to drink garbage, and reward you with a low price if you take them up on it, and if you don't throw up after taking the shot, GUESS WHO WALKS AWAY A WINNER....well kind of... Usually I lose pretty hard in the long run, because after doing 4-5 codgers over the course of an hour or so, thing go haywire.  One time I tried to open the men's bathroom, and it was locked. So I waited, then when the dude came out he was all like: \"THERE'S A LOCK FOR A REASON\". You are correct sir, apparently that lock is for you to do blow and have a temper tantrum if anyone so much as pushes on the door, why are you so angry? This is a bar bitch.  That's really the only doucher i've seen in this place.  The staff is always nice.  One thing I don't appreciate is when girls order wine at the woody, and then you're bill is suddenly $75, because someone had 5 glasses of wine and someone else had 5 codgers, and someone is signing receipts cross eyed, because they actually are $80 worth of drunk, but in the morning something doesn't seem to add up right.  Do the math on that, and don't order wine. Because in case you can't do math, it's $10 a glass.  The biggest problem the woody has, is that it's relatively hard to get a drink when this place is packed, which seems to be increasingly more often than not on your typical weekend.  Everyone has now discovered the woody, despite the lack of signage.  Hopefully someday soon all those people get over it and go back to old town, because I'm trying to have some room to run around in this bitch.  Also Skee Ball. Head to the back.",

    "text": "You guys have no idea how long I debated whether or not to leave a review for Little Woody. It was pretty much a goal of mine to keep it as secret for as long as I possibly could, mostly because the place isn't that big, I live across the street, and I appreciate at least a foot of personal space.  Welp, that foot of personal space is almost gone now so I figure it's about the time to profess my love for this not-really-a-dive bar, especially since they just added the most AMAZING back room a bar has EVER had.  Seriously, I could set up a cot, eat, drink, and sleep in that back room and have absolutely no problems in life. They have shuffleboard, darts, and SkeeBall! Really, what more can you ask for?  In my original review of The Great Escape (R.I.P., gone but not forgotten), I concluded with \"If they had shuffleboard, I'd bump them up to 5 stars\"...Little Woody did me one better and got shuffle board while simultaneously getting rid of that weird old person basement smell the place used to have (and replacing it with the lovely smell of wood).    What really makes this bar though is that everyone is seriously so freaking friendly. Once a guy asked me to punch him in the stomach...SUPER friendly because I love punching people.  Another time we sat down at a random table and played a game of RCL with a group of complete strangers, obviously awesome.  One stranger let me play with his iPhone 5 the day it came out just because I noticed it. I've only been mean-mugged like once and those girls clearly got lost looking for Mint, so that's not the Wood's fault.  All in all, I love this bar, I can now loudly declare that I love this bar, and if you want to come and be cool and love this bar with me you can. Just leave the mean-mugging in Old Town.",

The front room is like a normal bar and the back has a bunch of games including skee ball, shuffle board, foosball, and darts.  Really fun place to go at nights.  It's often our last stop for nights out.  Diverse crowd and laid back and fun.  The games used to be free but I think they charge for a few of them now (including skee ball) which kind of sucks but still worth going and playing.  Don't think I've ever had any of the food but heard it's good for being a bar.   Tips:  It's hard to spot from the road even though it's on Indian School road.  People also call it Red Owl because of the lit up neon red owl on the window facing the road.  The parking and entrance are in the back.  There's also a free shuttle to and from the Vig down the street at 40th and Indian School.",

    "text": "The wife and I came down to PHX to visit some friends this past weekend and came here for a nightcap after a stellar meal at beckett's table.   The first thing I noticed is there is no sign for this place from the street, just a pair of neon eyes in the shape of woody the woodpecker, at least I think. The entrance is in the back.   Okay, now that's out of the way let's talk about atmosphere and drinks. Both as you may guess, are fantastic. The place seems so small from the outside, but as you explore it just keeps opening up. Main room is a medium sized bar with damn efficient bartenders. Seriously guys, bravo. These bartenders are churning out craft cocktails in what seems like a minute. I started with a great old fashion, and then moved over to their take on a whiskey sour and it was the best I've ever had. A splash of Pinot noir to add some color and flavor. And the egg white perfectly foamed to perfection. My wife and our friends drinks were all really tasty too, and I wish I could remember the names. They also had a great selection of liquor in general and solid local and craft beers.  Ok back to interior. To the left is a large room with another small bar and a few pool tables. Awesome. To the right is another room through a short hallway and these great tall tables made of reclaimed wood. Oh and shuffleboard, skee-ball, darts. Maybe arcade games in bars are a fad, but this place pulled it off. It felt authentic, not campy.  Next time I'm on PHX, I'm definitely coming back.",

I understand you want as many people in there as possible, but it really degrades the experience. Maybe a Friday at 10PM is the wrong time to go if your looking to play pool and all the fun bar games. That is a small hiccup however as everyone there was really nice. The bartenders rocked! Fast and friendly, they remembered me right away, which is rare because I look like every white guy in the world!! Haha!   Best way I can describe this place is like the Eric's basement off That 70's Show. It's got a upscale divey feel. Really cool spot.",

This morning Eric, the GM, went out of his way to help me find my purse. He went back and looked at security cameras, etc. all while the bar wasn't even open yet. With the help of a few other friendly employees, he found the purse and made sure it got returned to me. Moral of the story, the people that work here go above and beyond and actually care about their customers. If you're looking for a fun chill bar and maybe feeling a little forgetful too, I'd highly suggest spending your evening at The Little Woody.",

She says they don't have sausage. I ask if they took it off the menu. She says \"I've worked here for two years we've never had sausage\". I come all the time and order the same thing every time, but i was with a group and didn't want to make a big deal about it. So I said bacon was fine. She leaves, comes back and says \"I asked, it's chorizo not sausage.\" -_- I just said ok that sounds great. Chorizo is a type of sausage and she REALLY was insistent that I was wrong at the table in front of everyone.   If you work somewhere for two years I'd hope you knew the menu and what options are available.   When you go you should definitely order the Mac and cheese with broccoli and chorizo. But make sure you say chorizo.",

Then a couple months ago, my son-in-law told me he met a friend there and it was pretty cool. I decided to meet a work colleague for drinks after work. The place was dark, comfortable, friendly and relaxed. There was a welcome absence of posers. Our waiter was quick and courteous, not too chatty, but friendly. I ordered an old fashioned and my friend ordered a beer. Both came out quickly and I have to say, it was the best drink I've had in quite a while. It was strong enough to get the job done, with a touch of aromatics and orange peel. The single, oversized ice cube melted slowly, giving it just the right amount of chill without watering it down while sipped. It was so good, I had to order another. I heard comments that there was a hipster vibe, but I didn't really notice. It was more of a relaxed, in-the-know, classic feel, without the pretentiousness that some hipster haunts fall into. I'll be back for sure.",

The Little Woody's vibe definitely matched it for us on that particular night as it was low key to one extent and then \"poppin\" when you least expected it. If you haven't' been, from the main street it will look like an abandoned building, but you'll notice the \"woody light sign\" so you know your in the right spot. Entrance in the back. When we walked in, it was packed... butt cheek to butt cheek!! If you're not familiar here's the deal, they have multip rooms so don't get discouraged when you walk in the main room. You can can either spend time in the bar area socializing, head to the center room large tables or make your way over to the game room area where there's a couple of TVs, ski ball, darts to play (all of which I don't play, but if you went to college & drank beer, this will be your flashback)  Getting a drink from the bar was probably the most challenging thing and if you're looking to play some games make sure you come with some singles or small bills ($1/$5) as you're going to need quarters. They do have a change machine locate up against the wall that takes up to $10 I think, but I can't imagine playing that much on the few things. If you do, you'll be \"that dude\" with a bunch of coins in their pocket trying to pawn them off on all the girls (that wasn't me, but we had a few \"big coin ballers\" that night.   The spot is cool and I would recommend as it's laid back for getting your friends together either as the nightcap or just setting it off for the night.",

The crowd is always friendly and there is a good competitive but respectful atmosphere when it comes to the bar games and various contests found throughout the bar. Add to all that the divey feel and you have a recipe for success. Also, good at any time of day from open to close. Highly recommend this to anyone but especially the craft cocktail lover!",

If you come on Saturday or Friday night it will be crowded; like standing room only crowded, but meeting new people is always great. I like the fact that there are multiple rooms so you're able to change up the scene throughout the night. Drinks have always been good and fairly priced. If you are a club person, this is not your spot. If you are a bar person that enjoys socializing/pool/games, you'll probably love this.",

Last night these regulars yelled at a woman that was trying to enter and use the restroom, and then proceeded to take 20 minutes before they left said bathroom.  From the way the bartenders acted I could tell this establishment is under the thumb of a small group of well to do, reptilian people, particularly a group of basic, identical looking blonde girls. Honestly there are better places that have a better vibe and thus attract the best people: take a better chance with the bar at Buck and Ryder, or Undertow, The Tavern, or the Whining Pig. Sometimes a bar is represented by the people that show up and how those people act and treat everybody else and trust me, there are better places to spend your time and money at than a place like this.",

A little rustic, a little funky, but charming. It's like an odd log cabin.  They offered unique beers which was a plus. I ordered a Peach Ale with guacamole and chips which were both great. Service was fantastic, we were definitely checked on from time to time.  What I really love about this place is the music and game rooms, as well as the dim light, warmth, and cozy feel. I was here on a Sunday night and they played Smashing Pumpkins, Radiohead, Garbage, Blink 182, Green Day, Sonic Youth, The Blur, and The Verve. So if you like the 90's, you'll like it here.  They have two large game rooms. One has billards. The other room (behind the bar) has shuffleboard, darts, and skeeball.  The bathrooms could use some work, they seem like outhouses or the bathrooms you would use at a public park.  Overall, it was a great experience but it might have been because I came on a slow night so there was no line for the games or wait at the bar. I would recommend coming on a Sunday night or weekday night.",

They offer an eclectic menu of small munchables, they have some decent beer on tap, and they have created some lovely sounding signature drinks.   There are a couple of downsides.   It is too dark in there to read the menu, and obviously it's not just us, since the bartender has a method (kinda cool)  for dealing with it.   The second thing is that while the interior is sleek and interesting, it isn't cozy.  You may not know me, but I'm a boozer, and I wasn't moved to stay for a second drink. I really want to like it since it is walking distance to my house and I will go back.  I just don't think I'm ever going to be a regular.",

We never saw our waitress but one guy was going around asking people about their drinks.  After 30 minutes of ordering a pretzel and pizza, I asked how much longer will it take to get a pretzel.  He was nice to go check and I didn't get charged for it.  The waitress never placed the order for the pizza, lame excuses. We left and went down the street to eat..so worth it too!",

Once you go inside, however, it turns into a trendy neighborhood bar with great drinks, a great atmosphere and best of all Skeeball! They also have Shuffleboard, Foosball, Darts and some board games.   This place just has a great neighborhood feel. I have not had their food but my boyfriend says they have great paninis!",

Tyler, the GM, has created an amazing \"dive\" bar with unique features that include an open beam ceiling, wood log walls, rustic wood tables, and and very homey lodge atmosphere. You would never notice LW's as you drive by, which makes it such a cool place, but if you do notice it, you should stop in and grab a drink. Tyler and Kristy made me feel so comfortable and were extremely friendly to me and my friend. I will def be returning with jumps of joy!",

No idea when they put it in but from the last time I was there it wasn't part of it and now that I know I'll be spreading the good word!  Had a few cocktails and the signatures were spot on but some of the other traditional cocktails we're something more to desire but the beer selection definately made up for it.",

I can't believe I've driven past it so many times and not realized it was tucked back off Indian School.   Its like dive bars meets speakeasy. The drinks were reasonably priced, but you can indulge in a craft cocktail if you so please.   There's plenty of games to play or comfy couches to chill on, so there's something for everyone.

Same bartenders every time I go, which speaks highly of management and management practices as the turnover seems very low. Nice job!

This room feels like your grandparents basement, tacky wall art/wood paneling included. On the other side there's skee ball and darts, I feel like that side encourages a louder crowd than the pool table room.  The drinks are good, bartenders are friendly and the staff is quick to clean everything up. The Little Woody is a winner.",

So, I expected more of a club feeling and less of a dive bar when I walked in through the door in the back that offers no marking of being the main entrance that it is. So, in I went and sat at the bar.. ordering drinks that were more expensive than I expected. But the bartenders was nice and very good, attentive and effective.  The longer I sat in the bar, the nicer and more crowded the place became.. and when I left, quite overserved, the place had risen like a Fenix from a dive to a small, intimate little night club.. and I say this with respect. I did not expect this at all. Nor what I walked into, nor what I walked out from.   While at the bar, getting served like a pro.. I discovered what many others has discovered before me, this tasty sneak attack called the Moscow Mule. Vodka hidden behind mint and ginger beer.. awesome.   So, visit The Little Woody.. and when you see the eyes on the building, its there.   .. und das ist nach der Kritiker",

I love the drinks, the decor, the hidden \"hide-out\" feeling, and the staff. My go-to drinks are the Sassafrass, the Arizona Mule, and the Tongue and Groove. I never go wrong with those three!  Unfortunately, the crowd here gets a little obnoxious for my taste. There are a few televisions around so at times the bar will be absolutely packed with screaming sports fans. If you go inside, you'll see that it's not the type of place you expect to see packed with screaming sports fans. Nor do you want it to be.  This would definitely be a 5-star frequent hang-out if so many other people didn't love this place too. Even if it was a more chill crowd that frequented The Little Woody I'd be more tolerant.",

There are just a few tables, a bar, a community table and some booths.  However, in True Vig form, the styling is second to none!  It's dark, homey, funky but with an understated sophistication.  The food is good.  We had a mushroom, truffle flatbread - excellent, arugula salad - good, beef and brie sandwich - very good.  A few cocktails and a few glasses of wine.  The service was excellent.  And (this is a big deal for me) parking was plentiful.  My only complaint was that the wine list was kinda sparse.  I'm not a big drinker, so it matters to me.  However, we'll be back - and we'll bring friends!",

My first time there but my wife has been there before and enjoyed herself.  Truly a local spot that is somewhat hidden but a neighborhood gem!  Upon entering the establishment, especially during the daylight hours, be prepared to have your eyes adjust to the windowless environment.  Seems very small when I went in however its larger that someone would initially expect.  This is not a sports bar!  Which is great change of pace and totally invites intimate conversation with couples and a really chilled hang out place with friends.  Once you enter the bar is to your right with a couple of tables to the left and directly in front.  Surprisingly there are some bar games that are around the corner from the bar on the west side of the building such as darts, shuffleboard.  There is also an additional bar if the crowd size overflows into the room.  On the east side of the building, there's another room that has 2 pool tables plus additional seating.  I was not expecting that.  The service was outstanding!!  The bartenders; tattooed sleeve tender, the formally dressed tender and Seth Rogan lookalike!  They were great!  As simple as it sounds, try the pretzel with the 2 dips that it comes with.  The ambiance is a great diversion from the chain bars that are out there.  Lastly, if you are bold enough...try the gunshy sour drink, its great!",

You just never know what you'll find behind that fire door off the parking lot. Look for the candles.   Come ready to lounge. Order a signature cocktail, or ask the bartender to make something up.

Because there is no sign announcing the name of the place you feel in the know when you spot the big eyed owl gazing over the street and realize this is the place.  It's too cool for a name.  You enter through the back, which is the front, because the front has no entrance.  Cool, right? Then its dark.  not seedy dark, but masculine and sultry dark.  Again, really cool. Once you get your drinks you head over to the game room and a new kind of cool hits: nerd cool, gamer cool, arcade kid cool. Shuffle board, skee ball (!), darts  and foosball are always exciting, and winning free beer with your insane skee ball skills is the coolest! Didn't eat this time, but the chalk boards advertised some tasty looking options.  And their cocktails, while maybe a bit pricey, were super intriguing.

    "text": "I heard all about this place from a good friend who recently moved to SB and after dinner elsewhere, their bar was packed so we decided to try out 'The Little Woody.\" First and foremost, I love the \"sign\" out front that has the light up owl. We parked just as a man was walking out of a door (one of three) in front of us, he kindly showed us where to enter, cracking jokes with us the whole way. We sat at the bar at first to get a drink from the same bartender. He showed me the whole menu cocktails and otherwise. I had no idea what I would want, so on his suggestion I tried to 'Tongue n Groove.\"  If you want a delicious girly drink, PLEASE try this. It was amazing. Sweet, with a little tang, and simply garnished. My friend had a jack n coke, and we went to sit on the couches on the other side of the bar. The bartenders were amazing, great service, super nice, they checked on us every little bit. Eventually we moved back up to the bar, and started talking to the barback, who suggested that we really check out the back room, so we did. It was full of games, shuffleboard, foosball, skeeball.   We ended up staying for about 4 hours, and at the end of the night, my friend just HAD to have some Jeremiah Wheat Whiskey.... kill me. I hate whiskey, but it was good,   The one thing I noticed was how adequately they staffed the bar. Three bartenders were there around 8 so you always had someone keeping an eye on your drinks, and never had to do that awkward wave until someone came over. The other thing I liked was the people there. Everyone from women in their 30's to men in their 60's. It didn't feel like there was a \"type\" of person who went there, just everyone.  I love this place, I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "The owners/operators of \"The Vig\" finally did us socially anxious types a solid. They built, for what for all intents and purposes, is a speak easy in the heart of what once was the glorious enclave of Arcadia. For those of you desert dwellers not familiar, Arcadia once was a swath of homes and businesses in the heart of eastern Phoenix with money and prestige that made Scottsdale residents once drool with envy.  Suburban sprawl and urban blight have regulated parts of this town into cesspools of poverty; some of the money has stayed put but now it is \"old\" money and Arcadia has suffered.  Located upon the bones of the \"Great Escape\" (a place that put the dive in dive bar) the only outward sign that you are in the right place is a giant flashing red owl face; the original building facade from the \"Great Escape\" still remains intact and lends to the mystique. Around back you'll find a (likely) packed parking lot, plenty of security (on most nights anyway) and a pair of faux gas lights beckon you in.  This is where my love/hate with the Little Woody begins.  The room(s) are simply stunning and anyone with vaguest idea of those responsible for the various \"Vig\" establishments will understand that one of the things these folks know how to do and do well is make a fan-fucking-tastic room.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of the under lit bar, old school (and I do mean old) cash register behind the bar and the unexpectedly awesome musical accompaniment. The drink menu is top notch (with the rhubarb old fashion at the top of my list) and while sparse, there isn't much on the menu that you will regret ordering. For the most of staff is competent and the game room (check it out for yourself) is a nice touch that maximizes the minimal space available.   I can't tell you how badly Phoenix needed this place...which is why I hate all of you for ruining it for me.  When the space was open for Sunday football I could at least enjoy some of the managerial/ownerships delectable eatable experiments, suckle at a bacon infused bloody Mary and watch my better half down a staggering amount of blood orange mimosas.  All of these are now gone (it turns out even our penchant for alcoholism couldn't save Sunday days) and those I know and love have been regulated to slinking in mostly on Sunday afternoons right when the place opens. Why you may ask? Simple; this place isn't a secret speak easy anymore.  On any given night the place is packed elbow to asshole with a vast assortment of individuals that have the social skills of a salted slug. But alas...there is money in this crowd and they suck down the crafted drinks on the menu like a citrus deprived sailor in an orange orchard.  I'm can't stereo type the entire crowd as such...simply put, as the popularity of the Little Woody has increased, I haven't been able to spend more than a few minutes in the place before my blood pressure sky rockets and I simply leave without ever catching the bartenders eye. But what's bad for a few is good for so many more; if I could stomach the patronage more perhaps I could rekindle my love affair with my beloved Woody?  Seeing as how I really don't give a hoot...if any of you out there in internet land decide to open or come across a bar named \"Nicodemus's Perch\" or \"N.I.M.H.\" please let me know. In the interim, to the lee of the stone we must go.",

Sitting around drinking can get a little boring, so I was happy to play some of their games like Jenga. They also have a game room with two of my favorite games with shuffleboard and skeeball! Skeeball in a bar!!!  A few negatives:  - The service can be very slow, seems like they might be understaffed, it's better to order from the bartender.  - The hummus tasted like paste, maybe this isn't the place to order food? I haven't tried anything else yet.",

LONG shuffleboard table, 2 skee balls, dart boards, video games. so much fun to be had! worth a visit for sure.",

We also went \"all in\" with the Charcuterie and Cheese and Fruit Platter. The toasted bread and cranberry chutney were perfect complements to the Brie, walnuts, grapes, and apples and more! It was easily the best cheese and meat plate that I have had. The rest of the menu looked delicious and I could have easily tried just about anything. My husband had the White Chocolate Ale which was also amazing. The decor was subtle yet fun and homey.  So glad that we drove a bit from our hotel to this cozy spot and would definitely go back!",

So, note to self: when you're on the prowl for this place just look for the little owl eyes...or maybe it's a woodpecker. :-p  I have only been twice, once on a Friday and then on a Saturday.  Both nights were completely packed.  It's quaint and a great crowd, a nice change from the Old Town Scottsdale scene.  They have tons of games in the back: foosball, skiball and something else I can't remember. ;)    Something totally random that I noticed and thought was super cute, they give the checks back in these little black books.  Not sure why that was one of the things I liked most.  I'm sure at some point I'll venture back out this way, cab ride from here to Scottsdale isn't bad and the drinks aren't overpriced.",

    "text": "I have made several ventures to hang out here and sadly.... The Little Woody is not my idea of a good time. Here's why:  -The service is slow (but I'm not blaming the servers, I know they're trying to maul through the abundance of human flesh standing, sitting, and loitering in their way).   -The bathrooms ALWAYS have a huge line. And if there isn't a line, there is a drunk girl puking in it and so I am just the first in the line that is sure to begin.   -I'm pretty sure fire codes are constantly being violated in this place. There are just way too many people here and it's ALL OF THE TIME. It's not like it's just the weekends... oh no.. it's the weekdays too. Which is AWESOME for their business but horrible for their customers who, like me, get extremely aggravated in confined spaces with 5 billion other human beings.  -I think it's a rule that when you hang out here you have to be loud, obnoxious, and way too intoxicated to make quality decisions. I swear. Everywhere I turn here, I was bombarded by another drunk person screaming in my ear about the skee ball tables or the drink they ordered.  -The drinks are overpriced. Plain and simple. I know this bar is in a nicer area and that the clientele are (supposedly) a little more mature (haha) and make decent money, but I could get the same drink a few streets down for HALF OF THE PRICE. Also. I don't ever think $10 is appropriate for a SMALL beer. Nope. Never. Not even Guinness or other \"fancy\" beers.   -Lastly... And I mean this in the least conceited and rude way possible, but I don't want to be hit on by men who are old enough to be my father. Thanks, but no thanks.   Aside from all of the things I don't personally care for, The Little Woody has a very nice staff (including the Bouncers) and the decor is cute. Actually if it weren't always more crowded than the DMV it would probably be one of my favorite bars to hang out at because of the ambiance. Overall, you do not COMPLETELY fail, Little Woody, however, I will not go out of my way to return unless requested by a friend.",

However it's is now an upscale/urban bar hangout. It's super cozy and it brings in  21-35 age group. I loved the music and decor. You are literally surrounded by logs. And the bar is perfect super old school and the bar staff are awesome. The only criticism I have is that the seatting is awkward and I wish there was a patio but I know because of the location there are legal issues.  All in all, I will definitely go back I live walking distance from it so its the perfect  for me,the boyfriend and friends to add this place to our bar bike tour ;)",

I am probably not the first person to say this, but winning a free drink playing skee ball is IMPOSSIBLE... but it's fun to try.  The shuffleboard is also so fun and is a rare find at bars.  Probably my favorite thing about this place!  From a past visit, I would recommend the moscow mule and they'll also make you a dark & stormy if you prefer rum.  Mixed crowd, relaxed vibe and plenty to entertain even the soberest person in your group - we'll be back the next time we're in town!  Oh - and you can park in the lot across the street for free.

I could play foosball for hours! It's fun, competitive, and you could make it into a drinking game. The skeeball and foosball are great ways to interact with other patrons, especially of the female variety.  All in all, it's a great place for my friends and I to pregame. I'll definitely be back.",

The \"bouncer\" gave me a tip on when a chill crowd is there, but I won't be sharing that with you!  Of course, if you are like me, the time to go is NOT on weekends, when college students and arrogant twenty-somethings overtake the place.    The coolest part about The Little Woody is they have Skeeball!  They also have Foosball and a couple other games, but Skeeball takes the cake.    Of course, if you don't heed my warnings and you go on a weekend, there might be a blonde who drank far too much hogging Skeeball; she might try to start a fight with you and your friends when you try to play an empty lane.  When you make it clear you will not tolerate drunken shenanigans, she might go into hiding for awhile and then reemerge even more drunk.  Well, at least that's what happened the first time I was there.  Still, the place is pretty nifty.    I'm not sure how much the drinks cost because, well, I'm a woman.  I don't think they could be too pricey, though, since I heard no complaints from my thrifty friends.  If you're one of those people who has to always do what the cool people are doing, go ahead and bookmark this one now.  ;)",

Pros: Whiskey/scotch/beer list The \"check presenters\" Friendly staff Back game room  Cons: Newfound inferiority complex pertaining to my skeeball average score",

    "text": "In my search for a new place for my husband and I to try, I came upon my friend Paul V.'s review of The Little Woody, and I was sold.  It may be a little hard to find (hint: just look for the owl), but once you do, youre in for a great time. Its dark and warm and inviting w/ plenty of seating to choose from.  We decided to try the food as well as the drinks. I had a brie panini, which was really good, but the star here is the craft cocktails. I had one whose name escapes me, but it had muddled strawberries. Very good, sweeter. I also tried the Hard Wood. Very, very good.  After we were done eating we decided to explore the place a little bit. Unbeknownst to us, they have a whole other side! Complete w/ skee ball and shuffleboard. They even host an adult skee ball league.  I would absolutely recommend this place to someone who wants a cool place to drink w/ friends, take a date, or have a drink somewhere thats off the beaten path.  i know *I'll* be visiting when Im back in town. Just sayin.",

    "text": "Fun \"dive-y\" bar in the Arcadia area with pool tables, dartboards, and hipster atmosphere. The Little Woody has a small menu and an impressive offering of whiskey and scotch, for those into the harder stuff. Service was very laid back....to the point my party thought our server had fallen asleep (translation: perhaps a wee bit more attention to guests please?). However, the place is comfy, not pretentious, and has enough distractions (read: pool tables, etc.) that even the more introverted types will have something to do.",

    "text": "Little Woody is one of my favorite weeknight bars. (Yes, I'm the type of person that has several favorite weeknight bars)  As the name wood describe (pun) The Little Woody is both small and completely covered in wood - which gives it a unique, relaxing ambiance and a perfect setting for a few drinks, or more.  This place honestly has a seating area for about any mood.  The community-ish style tables in both the main bar as well as the game room can be a great way to meet new people from the neighborhood while the booths can provide enough seclusion for a quiet conversation or a date night.  That said, the piece de resistance comes in the form of two Skeeball tables in the back of the game room.  I'll give you a minute to digest that.  Skeeball.  ...  There's something delightfully nostalgic about playing skeeball at the Little Woody, and True to the PeterPiperPizzan sport that we all learned to love in our youth - these machines print out tickets if you achieve a high enough score. (The great part is that instead of exchanging tickets for worthless toys - at Woody they're redeemable for booze)  I truly believe that the Little Woody started (or at least popularized) a trend that will be replicated throughout the valley.  I'm a fan, and recommend you give it a shot.",

The cocktails are imaginative and typically the bartenders ensure the pour is nice :)  The only complaint I have about this joint is the overwhelming sulfuric scent emanating from the women's bathroom in the front of the bar.  Not sure if this is like this always but the last few times I've been here it was almost enough to make me ralph.",

A parking lot is in is the rear.  It is usually busy and attire is casual. It has a nice atmosphere, a combo small Midwest town bar meets hipster vibe. One of those places that you can go in either dressed up attire or in jeans and a t-shirt.   The crowd in generally attractive and social. Traffic flow is poor due to layout of the bar. There is a back area with bar games.",

They know how to make some good drinks at this place.  Ordered up an old fashioned and normally I don't order them unless I know for sure it's going to turn out right, but the bartender assured me he knew what he was doing.  He was right, because it was one of the best old fashioned I've had in a while.  They also make a pretty good moscow mule, but the drink menu is filled with other amazing cocktails too!  Great music and great drinks to hang out with a few friends.    I wish I lived closer to this place because I'd be here every weekend and possibly a few times during the week.",

Certainly didn't feel like they were \"craft\" cocktails...",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for a while, so I finally stopped it with some friends for happy hour last night.  First, I really loved the atmosphere. It's dark, cozy, and kind of rustic feeling. One of my friends said \"I feel like we're in a cabin.\" It's perfect for relaxing for friends, and I think it would also make a great place for date night. The place is split in half with a bar in the middle, seating and tables on side, and then the games on the other. Although I didn't play any games this visit, I will definitely be back for that! They have shuffleboard, skee-ball and fooseball-how could you not like that?!  The drink menu had some great selections both beer and cocktail wise. I sampled my friend's Arizona Mule (aka a Moscow mule) and tried to order my own. Unfortunately, the bartender brought everyone else's drink but mine. I thought he was going to come back with it since his hands were full, but he didn't come back around for 15-20 minutes, so I ended up just getting a beer. The slow/forgetful service was kind of the theme of the night, but I'm pretty sure the bartender/waiter  was the only one working, so I don't want to be too hard on him.  The food we ordered was pretty good. I went with the turkey sandwich and thought it was flavorful, especially with the cranberry chutney. One of us ordered the grilled cheese, and it looked really good, evidenced by the fact that my friend that ordered it did not share with the rest of us. We also got an order of hummus and pita bread. The hummus was okay, but it was at least a generous serving.  Although I was disappointed by the service on this visit, I would like to try it again.",
