    "text": "The experience at Flower Child is different. First, You stand in a line to place your order, but they sometimes hold the line if the tables are full. They said this was because the food comes out SO QUICKLY. So, expect to stand for a considerable amount of the time you spend at this restaurant (at least if you eat during normal lunch or dinner time). Once seated, we waited more. The food doesn't come out quite as quick as they claim. Now, on to the food itself: it's good. The portions aren't giant, but this place is supposed to be for people that like yoga (there is even a yoga mat storage spot in the front). And it's expensive. The cheapest items that have protein are $11 (the Hippie Chick and Flying Avocado wraps). Overall, I think you can get food just as good without the waiting or the price in the area.",

Comes with a nice simple mixed green salad.  Also relaxed with a couple of beers which was a nice treat.  Topped it all off with a Bittersweet Brownie - yum.  Overhead some people complaining about the prices but after we started analyzing it we realized that for about the same price you could be a burger and fries up the street and it wouldn't be nearly as healthful or flavorful, so we decided that the prices were about right on.  Fox - you have a hit here in my book.  Just yesterday we tried another Fox restaurant and were sorely disappointed.  Don't just all of their restaurants the same - because they're not.  I've been craving salmon so we'll probably be back soon.",

The steak, chicken, and salmon are all quite delicious. We especially loved the sweet corn and quinoa, gluten free Mac n cheese, and the chili glazed sweet potatoes. And of course we had to indulge in gluten free chocolate almond cake. So moist and delicious.  Please Please Please open a restaurant in Orange County, CA. There isn't anything quite like this and I know it would do very well given our demographic. We certainly would eat here regularly and are sad to have just eaten there today for our last time on this trip.",

    "text": "Another Fox restaurant, the same old experience. First the good...like any Fox concept restaurant, the interior is extremely well done. Whoever the interior designers are for all of these places do a great job. The staff at this Flower Child was very good as well. I went twice on opening week and each time things were smooth, organized, and employees were very friendly.   As for the food, I've had the Rebel wrap which tasted pretty good and some chicken with a side of soba noodles and sweet potato, which also tasted good, but nothing earth shattering. Both times I walked out with a bill of close to $17-18 and was still hungry. The portion sizes are EXTREMELY small. This place is way overpriced. I did notice both times this place was mostly females eating and thought maybe the portion sizes are geared more towards that demographic. I would not recommend this place to men at all. Unless you spend $25 or more for food, you will be hungry.  I also have to say that the lemonade that comes highly recommended is horrible. If you have water at home and some Country Time mix, you can achieve the same taste as what they charge $4 here for.   Overall, we are in Scottsdale and places like this will thrive. I try and want to like the Fox concept places, but each time, walk away disappointed. This place is nothing more than a lower cost True Food, yet still way over priced for the food you get. In my humble opinion, for healthy food in a similar atmosphere, Pita Jungle is much better than Flower Child.",

Given this place has been open a while now it's a good sign to see happy staff remain! Happy to see somewhere in town that has several vegan options on their menu, and Kombucha on tap! The food is good, albeit pricey: thought it was a mistake when I ordered a Forbidden Rice bowl (with tofu) and it came to 14 and some change. I will say, a previous reviewer mentioned the \"value\" and I must agree. I suppose you must factor in the solid decor, and there is a large amount of staff that is always working. I almost don't mind when the meal is good (I'd loosely compare the flavors of my dish to something you could get at Pei Wei, only with a better variety of, and higher quality ingredients).  Just expect if you order an entree with protein and a beverage to be spending around $20 with tip. The portions are not huge, and doesn't include the addition of their sides (tried both the tabbouleh and heirloom tomato and watermelon salad, both decent.) No one in this area will, or does, balk at the price unless maybe they're not from North Scottsdale. Flower Child has enough going for it that I'd happily return.",

    "text": "I can't give this place enough stars and praise! Since it opened (barely a month ago), my friends and I go here ALL.THE.TIME!!! And I'm not kidding when I say all the time... we just can't help it. The food is fresh, tasty and healthy -- where can you go wrong? (Okay, okay, maybe the part where you \"go wrong\" is that it IS a bit pricey... but then again, can you REALLY put a price on your health?)  I highly recommend the \"Mother Earth\" bowl with chicken (or steak, you can't ever go wrong with steak). The healthy goodness is an explosion of flavors that all get to party in your mouth with each bite; it's my favorite! I also like the \"Late Riser\" for the days when I don't have time to have breakfast, since it has an egg in there as well -- it's almost like brunch in a bowl.   My friend really loves the vegan Caesar... she says the dressing is soooo good she could just do shots of it! And it's jam-packed full of nutritional goodness. The \"Flying Avocado\" is so mouth-wateringly delicious as well! And that avocado hummus... oh my! (Just wish they'd give you more of it.)   If you're into mix 'n matching, the grass-fed steak, with Indian Spiced Cauliflower and red chili glazed sweet potatoes are amazing and will leave both stomach and tastebuds jumping for joy!!! Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order from their menu -- it's healthy, filling, nutritious, and oh so good.   The only down fall is that the line is out the door around the lunch hour, so it's good to phone in the order so you can sneak in and grab it while others are waiting in line. Just beware -- when grabbing a to-go order, be sure to check the amount of food you receive, because a lot of the time, you'll get jipped on your portion size. Both my friend and I have ordered the same exact dishes while dining in and also to-go, and the portion sizes definitely differ; not sure if they're in a hurry and don't pay attention to how much food they give you or what. Other than that, I am a flower child! :)",

The Mother Earth bowl was very similar to the ancient grains bowl at True Food Kitchen, where the biggest different I saw was the tofu, which was sliced in smaller, more manageable pieces at Flower Child compared to TFK. Overall, it's a great pick for takeout, if you're looking for something that tastes good while being reasonably good for your body.",

Everything on the menu was extremely healthy and looked delicious. It took my forever to figure out what I wanted to order because I wanted everything!!!   I finally picked and got the Vegan Ingredient Salad. It had cauliflower, corn, tomatoes, avocado, olives, and a vinaigrette. It was so fresh and delicious and I loved having the feeling that I was eating so healthy while eating something with so much flavor. I also ordered an iced tea and I picked the Passion Fruit Black Tea and I put some lemons in it. They only had natural sugar which was awesome because those ones are great for you over the unnatural ones.   I really loved this place and the service was great as well. Every employee was super nice. The only downside was there was no WIFI, but it was ok because the food outweighed that negative! I would love to be able to relax in Flower Child though and get some work done!!   Overall an amazing experience and I will 100% be going back to Flower Child!!",

I eat out daily, and have no problem spending $70 on a great steak dinner.  This is a fast casual concept, not a full service restaurant. I get a bowl with under 3oz of chicken (the cheapest meat on the menu) for $14. Yes, it's all non gmo, organic bla bla. Yet I can get more than double the amount of non gmo chicken at chipotle for $6.50, and barely finish my meal. I was VERY hungry when I left Flower Child, and had to immediately purchase more food elsewhere. My wife easily finished her meal, and she takes home half at most any other restaurant.  I'm fine paying a premium for quality product, which Flower Child definitely has, but over double the price for half the protein is unacceptable. I feel that around $8 for their bowls with chicken included would be right about the right price. $14 is pushing the price to its absolute limit. If the price was right, I would eat here every week, but at the current prices, I unfortunately will never return. -3 stars for being a terrible value.",

I also love the Hydration station out front before you walk inside. This is a great place to take kids since you can get very healthy and customized kids meals for a good price! Love this place!",

    "text": "The Soup of the Day on the billboard was from yesterday's menu. They forgot to take it down. Sad. Strike 1.  The free-range egg + quinoa bowl I ordered, and requested no corn. Hey Flower Child, all corn is GMO. Why is it on your menu? I asked for no corn. I was told that since I didn't want corn, I also could not have the beans. So, I received a measly portion of quinoa with a splattering of egg, and about 1/16th slice of avocado. Sad. Strike 2.  My daughter ordered a-la-carte brown rice + tofu. I think the price was $9 for her Pick 2. The amount of brown rice was less than 1/4 cup. The slices of tofu were minuscule and barely there. She tried to doctor it up by adding some of my quinoa. Still Hungry. Strike 3.  Kombucha: when I ordered it, on tap, I was not given a choice or description of Kombucha. I saw they had 3 or 4 taps. I was just given Kombucha. I have no idea even what flavor it was. What was that? Strike 4.  Price: wasted my money. Strike 5.",

I had the Cobb Salad but subbed the apple cider dressing instead of whatever dressing it came with. It was really good but kind of small for almost $9. The portions are small but probably actual serving sizes and the menu items are a bit pricey. My friend and I got there at 1pm on a Thursday and the place was packed! I would totally go back. I also noticed they had gluten free desserts but I didn't have any of them.",

The mac n cheese had a great taste, but the portion size was pathetic.  The prices are outrageous. I realize that eating healthy is expensive, but it shouldn't be.  I think if Flower Child lowered their price by a coupe dollars for each item, I would make this a regular place.  Also, a couple hours after eating this food, I had a huge stomach ache.",

It's a very well put together menu with all levels of healthiness, sizes, vegan & vegetarian, etc. My go to is the Flying Avacado but if I'm real hungry I love doing one of their various 2-3 item meals w/ choice of protein. The selection is beautifully minimalistic and for good reason, with these well known delights, the staff in the kitchen really make their ingredients shine (it's kind of funny they share a wall with Jimmy John's).   Not only do they have amazing food (which is available for take out btw) but their speciality cold teas, lemonades and other drinks are the most refreshing things I have ever tasted.   Also this place is GREAT for going in and having a meal and reading or going on a date, the decor is really gorgeous to say the least. Make sure you try out this little sister to Culinary Dropout.",

It tastes great, is satisfying, and feels healthy. The Organic Smashed Potatoes are everything you want mashed potatoes to be (warm, soft, and so comforting) but taken up a notch than what most of us make at home with subtle garlic and rosemary.   This is a great choice, and especially great for people at Scottsdale Shea hospital (healthy food that beats the hospital cafeteria).",

I had the Flying Avocado wrap which was delicious. My wife had the Forbidden Rice which was equally amazing.  I kinda loved that they had tea and lemonade to drink and NO soda.  They also carry a local brew, today's pick was Four Peaks White Ale.  There were many great choices on the menu, even a mix and match section.  I would recommend this to anyone who has dietary restrictions...or anyone who loves great food!  Yummy!!",

I am a small girl & can not eat that much at once so I can not figure out what is going on??? I have ordered salads, wraps, and the warm dishes. All incredibly small portions. I called in and ordered the Hippie Chic wrap. I asked for extra chicken salad because if I do not I get maybe 4 bites with filling and the rest is wrap. When I arrived they charged me $17.17 for a wrap!! The normal price is $11 and I told the girl the only way I get what I pay for is to ask for extra. I had to get to work & could not wait to speak to the manager. I have done so previously and will just no longer go there. There are many many other restaurants that have fresh food & realistic portions. Just know you will leave hungry.",

Not only is the food delicious, but I love the variety of lemonades that they offer. I love that every time I go there, I know I will get to experience a new flavor. I can't leave without the their gluten free lemon muffin to satisfy my sweet tooth. The mere thought of it has me salivating right now. The only downfall of all this yumminess is the price. They are definitely more on the pricey side, but well worth it for delicious and healthy food.",

Main course was the Skinny Cobb with grass fed steak protein.  Total cost was $14.  Plenty of food, very tasty and would order again. Also ordered Mother Earth with Salmon protein for $16.  Very good! Some may say its a little pricey but you get what you pay for.  Ingredients are locally grown and the food was very fresh.  I counted 13 workers behind the counter.  By the way, its very casual so place you order at the counter and they will deliver the meal to your table.   No tip necessary. They offer salads, plates, bowls and wraps.  Very healthy eating and good for you! They also offer wine, beer and variety of teas. Looking forward to return!",

They were, in fact, delicious alongside my grilled asparagus and steamed broccoli which I topped with salmon for $16 and felt like a fitness culinary champ. \"Go healthy, tasty food!\" \"Go me!\"  One woman asked my other friend which salad she had. I don't remember which it was, but both of them loved it. I was drooling at all the salads.   People were lined up out the door - a testament to how badly this place is needed east of the 101.

It had kale, grapefruit, apples, cheese, black currants and almonds. This salad captured everything your mouth could ever want. There was savory (chicken and cheese), sweet (apples and black currants), sour (grapefruit), crunchy (almonds and apples), soft/chewy (cheese and black currants).... Anyways, you get the point. It was delicious! I will definitely be returning to try something else.  If you're one that enjoys hot food, there aren't too many options. There is pho and some other soup options, but there isn't anything like a burger. I am not sure if the wraps are warm, or if you get a side of meat, such as salmon, chicken or steak, if those are warm or not either. This struck me more as a cold type of food restaurant.   I am removing one star for the size or the salad I received for the price I paid. Although I was full after my salad, I paid $17 after tip for a salad with some chicken on it. I think that's pretty high, since it wasn't a huge salad and probably only had 3 ounces or less of chicken.",

The line was pretty long and I didn't know what to expect since all of the food is organic and sounded like nasty rabbit food. The line moved slow enough for us to decide what to order (give or take 10 min.) and we were given a table number and fresh blueberry lemonade while we waited.  The prices are a little high, but the quality is worth it. We ended up getting the forbidden rice bowl, the rebel wrap (sub horseradish for avocado hummus), and the free bird wrap. I tasted a little of my families food, both of which were great, but I will be back and the rebel wrap will most definitely be my regular. Also, you can't go wrong with any of the teas or lemonades. But don't forget to put sugar in them!!  One thing that I did not like is that it was too noisy. I prefer eating at a place that doesn't have the music blaring (and I'm barely 26).",

    "text": "I am overly stoked about this restaurant opening up a few miles away from my home.  I have been waiting for it's grand opening since I first heard of the announcement coming to North Scottsdale.  As I expected there was a line out the door.  Not unusual for this place.  It's location in Arcadia is always busy.    Once I arrived I was greeted with a menu and asked if I was dining in or taking out.  I chose dining in and to be seated in their outside patio.  She provided a number that I would give to the person taking my order.  The line went by fairly quick.  I was in a line of at least 15 people and within 10 minutes I was placing my order.  I ordered the Rebel Wrap $13 and a regular drink.  It can get pricey to eat healthy, but this wrap is probably one of the best wraps I've had.  I filled my drink with their signature cucumber lemonade and I sat at my table.  Within 10 minutes of waiting my food arrived.  Impressive timing considering the amount of people.  I was in and out of there with time to relax in about 45 minutes.    I imagine it'll be busy for a while, but it's well worth the wait if you're looking to indulge on a healthy meal.  Their gluten free desserts are also a great treat for the sweet tooth.",

Everything is fresh and healthy though this place has a few more GF dessert options than other similar places.   I can't give it 5 stars though because it's always noisy...not in a fun, trendy restaurant way, but in a someone didn't plan the acoustics well way. Consequently the music always seems too loud.   I'm kind of hooked on the Vietnamese Crunch Salad, and I got $100 gift card from Costco for $79.00 so I'll tolerate the noise once in a while.

The line moves fast so if you haven't been there before you may want to brush up on what they serve and decide in advance what you want to order. Of course I didn't do that and quickly ordered the chicken wrap which was good but wouldn't be my first choice should I return. My daughter got the same thing due to haste. We also shared my comp'd birthday treat a lemon cupcake which was good; not very lemony but very moist and fresh. I loved the selection of teas and think my favorite had a citrus flavor and I think it was the Cosmopolitan. One other downfall was they only had 1 bathroom that was operational and one bathroom to accommodate a very crowed restaurant was ridiculous with a line of 5-6 men and women at a time. It was good, clean but not excited to return.",

As you walk in the  main entrance there is an area to drop off your yoga matts for fellow yogis, which is also next to the crayon bucket and hippie car coloring paper for kids. Ordering style is like an upscale fast food restaurant where you order at the counter, grab a number and find a table.   If you order a drink they have various teas and lemonade fountains to which you can mix and match! I got a mix of the pineapple lemonade and mango tea.. Food wise I grazed on the Mother Earth for that earthy meal made of sweet potatoes, quinoa, avocado, cucumber, broccoli, pesto sauce, portobello mushrooms and a vinegarette! I was grounded to a wholesome complete meal! This dish is the same as their sister restaurant,  True Foods with their dish called Ancient Grains - which is the ingredient listed for Mother Earth. The apple didn't fall far from the tree! The only comment on the ancient grains in Mother Earth was the grains were a slightly undercooked and hard. Everything else was superb.   Anyway and either way, the place is to be at and the food  is  organically made. Can't wait to eat here again!! Yum yum!",

Fresh greens, tomatoes and covers with a delicious vinaigrette dressing specially crafted Cobb style.  Sat outside and even under the mister was a nice breeze.  My only complaint is the noise level, very difficult to hear your party especially during the lunch break and tables get pretty tight.

Let alone the fact that if you do have dietary restrictions, they accommodate you no problem. Quality food, great setting, and super friendly people. How could you not love it???  You order at the front and they give you a number and deliver your food, so you get to pick where you want to sit. There is ample indoor and outdoor seating.   I've leaned towards wraps here, but on my recent visit I opted for a plate. With their plates you can pick one two or three of their selections (veggies, rice, avocado, Mac and cheese, etc) and even add a protein should you wish. I ended up with Salmon, brown rice, and avocado. So so SO good. Food is fresh and the salmon was cooked just right. Honestly to die for. My friends had salads and they raved about them too.   They have a great selection of unsweetened ice tea so I was set on the drink front. I noticed they have some organic wines too that I'll have to try sometime.   It can get pretty crowded here at peak lunch time and dinner, but still worth it always. It can get a little pricey depending on what you order, but you really do pay for quality.",

    "text": "UPDATE:   I've updated my rating from a 2 star to a 3 star because I recently heard from the restaurant manager at this location, Blake. He apologized for the experience I had and seemed to genuinely want to improve on the shortcomings I experienced on my last visit. I really appreciate the sincere follow up and look forward to giving this location a second chance in the near future (though not on a holiday or peak time). I'm aiming for a quieter time of day next time. Looking forward to trying some of their salads and iced tea, which I had no room for last time. Perhaps in the future I will have more great things to say! Until then, I have upgraded my review from 2 stars to 3 stars as a more neutral rating.  ---------------  I wanted to love this place, I wanted to like it better - but it's a challenge after my last visit. The menu at Flower Child is everything I love; so I was psyched it would be awesome! I don't know if it's because I visited on the holiday, quite honestly I wasn't expecting it to be as busy as it was. I mean 4th of July is usually about ribs, wings, beers, and everything you're not supposed to have; maybe we all missed the memo or were just compensating for tonight!   The food was the best part along with the decor. The worst part was the 15 deep line that was very inefficient at the cash. Not only was the wait long to order your food, finding an indoor table was near impossible. I also got heck from the lady at cash because my table didn't have a number on it, I can't help that the guy who is assigning table numbers skipped over me.   Staff in general seemed unprepared for the crowd, as many staff members were running around seemly lost in direction and purpose. The kitchen appeared to be running the staff, with no one in charge. Spoons were nearly out, the first one I grabbed was dirty with crusted on food. Waits for the bathrooms were ridiculous.   The flow of the dining area is not great, it encourages people to constantly barge through the center tables, with strollers and everything knocking your dishes into you. To put it lightly the atmosphere was complete chaos. There is zero privacy the way the dining area is set up, you are literally on top of your neighbor - this also makes the area so loud, that you cannot carry on a conversation without shouting across the table.   We had ordered a fully vegan lunch, but somehow they made a mistake of giving me sweet corn & quinoa with greek yogurt instead of the red chili glazed sweet potato with bok choy & sesame. I'm still trying to figure out how such a major error was made, since it clearly states on the receipt \"sweet potato\". I would normally go up and have the side mix up corrected, but with such a huge line and people running each way, it was easier just to not bother and who knows how long the wait would be. Sides were ok, nothing stood out as excellent, or anything I would order again. Three Vegetable & Grains \"Mix 'n Match\" sides were $9 and tax, and for the portion size ran far too small. Either portions should be increased or the price brought down to maybe $6 or $7.   The Whole Grain Wraps Thai Dye for $10 I would say is reasonable and was tasty and came with a simple side salad. The avocado hummus at $7 was delicious but only worth $5, especially if they are going to be skimpy on pita's to dip. Honestly they should have included double the amount of the pitas or some veggies. Yes, I know you can substitute raw veggies for $3, but you shouldn't have to give up the pita for adding $3. The fresh coconuts at $5 were about average price for a restaurant and quite refreshing.",

It's a very good portion - I could barely finish it :) the sides are nice to share too, although the ones we picked weren't the healthiest-but they tasted good! The corn and the Mac n cheese were yummy and so were the roasted sweet potatoes. The only thing I don't like about it is it's really loud inside, when it's busy--and it's always busy!

The food is delicious, the decor is adorable and bright, and the people are sweet and willing to work around your food allergies. I ordered the Early Riser without cheese and she asked if it was preference or allergy, meaning that they are even careful with my little lactose intolerance! As a vegan restaurant I know they must be diligent but it made me respect them even more when she asked. The Mother Earth bowl is a favorite and their hummuses are mouth watering although I'm partial to the avocado hummus. Their sides are great, heirloom tomatoes and watermelon are a must try.

I guess Asian smarts don't always include common sense because the prices here really aren't that bad.... and the food is GOOD.   I got two dinners for myself and my boyfriend (combined, not each; although we are both hungry hungry hippos). One was a steak plate with three sides: cauliflower, mac & cheese, and the watermelon tomato salad. We also got the forbidden rice bowl per the cashier's suggestion. Everything had a unique and delicious flavor. Complex but well balanced. Not only that all the different colors made the meal extremely aesthetically pleasing.   Home run, guys. I'll probably be in soon (like in 5 min).",

This is my first visit to Fox's Flower Child, as the restaurant is casual (you stand in line to order, get the food brought to you at the table) the service is compared to their sister restaurant The Henry!   While waiting in line the staff keeps you busy in studying their menu (a must before approaching the cashier..) and offering drink samples.  The staff also asks if you are dining in and if so they assign you a number to give the cashier (did I mention they place the number on your table so the table is ready for you after you pay and get your drinks? - saves from having to table hunting!).  All food served at the Flower Child is gluten free, so anything you order is good for your heart, mind and soul! :-)  I had The Rebel which is a steak wrap and it had lots of flavor and tasted fresh.  The service was excellent, the food came within 10 minutes, the staff took up finished plates after eating and kept our table free of trash/straw wrappers.  If you're looking for a healthy place to eat The Flow Child is a place to go (need more restaurants like them).  Chris",

    "text": "My wife and I recently had lunch here after I did some exhaustive research on places that were more unique than the average lunch spot.  This appeared to fit the profile so we hiked it up here from our hotel.  It is definitely a hike to get here.    To start with, I can echo the comments that I have seen about the dining area being kind of in disarray.  It's like controlled chaos in terms of ordering and then standing there waiting to be seated.  You have a dozen people behind you and you are kind of standing going \"Hey how ya doin'?\"  It seems like the main complaints here are with the layout and the way they have their system setup.  The food is a 10 but the experience takes it down a notch.  There were too many people going \"WTF?\"   The flow of the dining area is too scattered.  The tables are stacked on top of each other so there is zero privacy in the dining area.  You are far too uncomfortably close to your neighbors.  People don't want communal dining.  It;s almost impossible to have a conversation and enjoy your personal space.  It was close enough that it looked like I brought a purse even though it was the woman's at the table next to me.  Now as for the food, it was very fresh and we both enjoyed it.  My wife went with the Mother Earth bowl with Salmon.  She had that \"I am happy,\" look on her face so it was a success there.  I went with Thai Dye wrap which was chilled perfectly and hit all the points on the scale of taste, crisp(I added lettuce to it) and spice.  I also grabbed the Simple Hummus as a side and it was some of the best I have had in awhile.  They have the food part down pat.      We would return to this place. The main advice I would offer is for the ownership to see that the complaints here are more about the way you have designed the ordering process and the way you setup the restaurant.  It's a relatively simple problem to overcome and if you can accomplish that, you will see more 5-star reviews because the food stands on its own.",

This time I also got the spinach which was excellent!    My mom got her usual flying avocado wrap. I had a bite and it is wonderful. I love the smoked Gouda. We both had the ice tea which was excellent and I'm not usually an iced tea drinker.    The service was excellent and the cashier who took my order was very friendly. The downside was it was very busy so it was quite loud. Despite that I love going to Flower Child!  I wish there was one in the East Valley!  Please open one in Chandler.",

    "text": "I have been to flower child many times and each time I go, it gets better and better. Most people think that Flower Child only has food that healthy people will like. Well, they are wrong. Flower child may seem as though it revolves around vegans, but it really caters to everyone who enjoys an excellent meal.  When you walk in, you wait in line and order at the counter, once you order you pay and get a number. The \"number system\" fits the whole atmosphere and the concept of the restaurant. Any other service would ruin the laid-back and relaxed feel of the place.   My go-to dish there is the forbidden rice bowl. It is absolutely delicious. the vegetables are perfectly cooked, not too overcooked or undercooked. The sauce does have a bit of a kick, but as a person who enjoys mildly-spicy food, it was just perfect. Depending on how big your party is, the food comes out in 10-15 minutes, which goes by pretty fast.  For drinks, there are many selections. They have different seasonal lemonades that they make from scratch, ice tea,  and various bottled drinks. Since the lemonades are seasonal, you never know which ones they are going to have. I usually get a fruity lemonade, or the original. This time, I got the pomegranate lemonade. It was the right balance of sour and sweet.   The atmosphere at flower child is very welcoming and homey. You never feel rushed. All the servers are friendly and well trained. The restaurant is decorated beautifully, it is so cute and fits the personality of the place.  Overall, Flower Child is a great place with amazing food and a wonderful Atmosphere. Although the wait can be long and the food can be pricey, that can be all set aside because I would definitely go back. They make healthy taste good.",

Today we had a minor problem with one of our order, their manager sarah was so hospitable and took care of the minor snafu so easily. It is hard to find restaurant staff that's takes guest service relationships seriously. Sarah was great! We love all the food we ordered. Our favorite is their sweet corn and quinoa and their forbidden rice!! You will not be disappointed with anything there.",

That couldn't be further from the truth when it comes to Flower Child!    It's a bit confusing when you enter and depending on which door you go in, you might be on the wrong end of the line you have to wait in line to order.  You have to read the menu closely because entrees are priced without \"proteins\" which you can add for $5 or so. 2 adults and 2 kids was about $75 which is kind of pricey for a restaurant that does not have table service.  The Yellow Curry is amazing as well as the selection of more natural ice teas and lemonade.   Very busy during weekday lunch so you may have to wait a few min between placing your order and sitting at a table.   Will be back with family as they do have nice meals for kids too!",

I love that they offer vegetarian, gluten-free, and vegan options for those individuals that are following particular diet plans or want to skip meat/do not eat meat or are gluten intolerant. I also am a big fan of their protein selections being naturally raised without additives along with organic produce being used within their salads. I decided to stop for a bite to eat for lunch and selected the Mother Earth bowl with chicken. I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of my bowl. The combination of sweet potatoes, portabello mushrooms, charred onions, avocado, cucumbers, broccoli pesto, ancient grains, leafy greens, red pepper miso vinaigrette, and hemp seed along with the chicken was one combination that left me full with satisfaction. The rose petal lemonade was a refreshingly light lemonade that paired well with the Mother Earth bowl. I look forward to coming back and would like to try out one of the salads on the menu.",

This whole healthy food craze is driving me nuts with the special juices and organic everything, but the food here has won me over. Food can be healthy and still taste great! How cliche does that sound?  I haven't been here in awhile so I ordered the quinoa salad and added salmon. The quinoa salad may sound boring but it's not. It's full of flavor on its own even without the salmon added. It had colorful beets in it as well as well broccoli. The chia seed vinaigrette was a unique touch along with the pistachios and manchego cheese! The salmon added was tender, flaky, and not overdone. That's hard to achieve when food is brought out impressively quickly during lunch rush hour.  I'm definitely still a fan! Is it too much to ask for one on the west side of the valley?!?",

    "text": "Flowerchild is a part of the Fox Restaurant Company family and fits in their brand quite well. However, Flowerchild seems to be a bit more unique in terms of the FRC lineup of restaurants. Walking in, you are immediately engulfed in a happy and hipter-ish vibe. The staff is always incredibly friendly and ready to help. It is set up as a place your order and then, the staff brings it out. This is nice because it gives you a quicker dining experience if you are in a rush; it is nice to have the option to dine at your pace. The lines can get a little crazy depending on what time you go at, if there is a wait however it is never too long. I would say the maximum you might wait would be between ten-fifteen minutes. Speaking of the wait, it is never the employees or restaurant's fault for ordering wait time. You really only run into a wait when there is a lunch or dinner rush, but it is understandable. During these rushes however, it sometimes be tough to find a place to sit. But when a table does open up, the staff does an incredible job at clearing the table off right away. Food comes out in a reasonable amount of time you're never waiting more than ten minutes. The overall service is great!   When you are seated and do have your food, you will not be disappointed. The menu offers many healthy options, which is a turn off for some. However, their healthy foods are packed with flavor and are delicious. A few of my favorites are the 'Flying Avocado Wrap,' the 'Kale Salad,' and their sweet potatoes and tofu. Each one is packed with its own distinct flavors. It is nice to know that the food you're eating is delicious and packed with amazing nutrients. Nothing ever feels greasy or heaving to eat. The 'Kale Salad' in particular is one of the best salads in the valley, in my honest opinion. The apple cider vinaigrette is nice and tangy yet refreshing. The apples and grapefruit give it a fresh and light taste, while the white cheddar brings a little bit of a bite to it filling you up. It is the perfect balance of flavors and textures. Pair that with scrumptious red chili glazed sweet potatoes and you are good to go. The sweet potatoes practically melt in your mouth and unleash an abundance of flavors, the perfect blend of sweet and spicy. The food is all delicious, but you have to go in to it with an open-mind. You will not find French fries or greasy chicken tenders here. Expect to feel healthy, balanced, and satisfied after your meal. The only slight downfall of the restaurant is its prices. They tend to be on the pricier side of this style of dining. However, it is justifiable given the freshness and quality of all of the food. It definitely makes it worth the price.   Lastly, the overall ambiance of the restaurant is truly unique. There is beautiful sense of rest, even at its busiest hours. You feel like you are taking care of yourself and allowing yourself to slow down even for a few minutes. The interior decor is second-to none looking shabby chic and rustic all at the same time. In addition, everything is always immaculately clean. Any time of day and any type of weather you can count on Flowerchild for making you feel at home and cozy. It perfects the blend of trendy and comfort, making each trip in wonderful. I highly recommend the restaurant to anyone who is looking for a bit of healthy comfort and happiness.",

    "text": "Went to Flower Child for the 3rd time for lunch around 11:45am.  Long line waiting all the way outside the restaurant in today's 106 degree heat.   Line moved very slowly and there was not enough shade to cover every one.  My girl friend went inside to tell the manager to serve cold water for guests waiting in line as we spotted a young pregnant woman standing in the sun.  Finally, a young girl carried a tray of water and lemonnade passing it around.  There was no table inside the eatery availalbe, so we cannot order food at the counter and were told to sit aside until there is table for us.  Another 10 minutes wait until the hostess gave us a table number.  At this point, we had already been waiting for 40 minutes!!!  I had the Flying Avocado which was tasty.  My girl friends had Madras Curry and Chopped Salad with chicken.  They liked their meals, but we all felt the portion was small.  Curry has only few slices of chicken, no rice.  We were satisfied, but not full.    The menu was simple, but it is obviously for people that are vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free,  The portion is definitely small because my teenage son went there and had to order two dishes and a desert.  It gets very expensive!   As for me,  I am too poor to have any digestive issues, so this place, although health conscious, is not where I'd come back again any time soon.  I went there all three times waiitng in the hot sun and no one from the inside the restaurent is paying any attention to serve cold water.  There is obviously not enough tables, staff or the ordering system is not working smoothly.  As far as the food taste, it is similar to True Food, other than few popular items, the rest is very blend.  Definitely NOT worth waiting in the heat and long line for 40 minutes!!!",

The food, people and atmosphere are all top notch.  My go to order is a custom plate with sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and a side of avocado hummus. But I've tried plenty of their meat options before I started eating a (mostly) vegan diet, and was just as impressed!  Flower Child is an absolute must try, just keep in mind that it can get awfully busy, especially around lunch time! But they do have online takeout ordering as well. My only gripe with that is how you can't use a Flower Child gift card to pay online :(",

While we're looking for places to live here we looked for a healthy bite to eat once we were in town. So we figured we'll check out the location here instead of our local one.   Boyfriend had built a meal of chicken, organic mashed potatoes, and broccoli. Mashed potatoes were excellent. Broccoli is what you would expect. There was hardly any chicken which was a $5 additional charge... you would think you would get more for that.  I had the madras yellow curry dish with additional charge of shaved chicken. Tons of veggies including broccoli, snap peas, green beans, carrots, and potatoes. I thought it was excellent for a healthy alternative. It was both vegan, gluten free, and full of flavor!   For these 2 dishes & 1 beer it was $35... so what you would expect from your more natural/healthy restaurants.  What I love about it is they cater to people who are gluten free, vegan, vegetarians, or a carnivore, so a great place when you are in a group of mixed eaters.   Will definitely be back once we live here.",

My go-to dish is the Forbidden Rice bowl (with added salmon) and my fiance loves the Flying Avocado wrap. If you are checking out the sides, definitely consider the cauliflower! It's my favorite. We also like the mac-n-cheese and the mashed potatoes. Everything always tastes so fresh and delicious.   My coworkers enjoy this place as well and we frequent this place at least 5-8 times a month. One of my coworkers is vegetarian and loves the variety here. This is one of those places where you walk up and order at the counter, receive a number and they will bring your food to the table.",

They honestly never fail, their staff is so helpful and sweet, and I always feel like a million bucks after eating their food (rather than feeling tired or gross)! win/win/win  I've had most of the menu at FC - I love the vegan poke bowl, and the Vietnamese Crunch salad is so cool and refreshing. But there's one thing I just can't quit. And it's the plate.   Basically, you get to pick 1-3 items of your choice. As a person who can never decide what to eat, it's my dream.   I always get the green vegetable of the moment (right now, I'm loving the green beans), the sweet potatoes, and sweet corn & quinoa. Sometimes I even live large and get 4 sides!  I am also obsessed with their little gluten free lemon cakes and chocolate chip cookies and also the amazing flavors of lemonade but I do my best to forget they exist because they're just *too good*!  Love the proximity to my office. Probably a good thing it's not closer.   10/10 recommend.",

We paid the ticket and sat down and waited for our food.  They delivered her toast and my salad. She asked about the side of fruit. Shortly after that, a man came to the table with a very very small bowl and set it down on the table. He proceeded to scold us that we are not allowed to substitute fruit for the egg.  He said he was generous enough to do it this time only and basically walked away.  Im not sure why a customer was scolded for a sub on food.  We asked at the register and they said sure, no issue mentioned.  This employees irritation with an illegal substitution was directed at the wrong person.  Pretty much tainted the restaurant for us.  Toast was pretty measly for price.  First Watch is far superior with their avocado toast.",

I think this is a great place to come to if you are vegan & want to have several options to eat while dining with meat & dairy eaters. It is a bit expensive, but you have to remember that this is quality food. It may be priced higher than other places, but the cost is substantially lower when it comes to your health & the negative impact other places have on the environment, people, & animals. The employees were also really sweet & helpful. If available, get the pudding. It's to die for. I'll be coming back here next time I'm in Arizona!",

I went for lunch during the week and there was about 20 people ahead of me in line. I was a little nervous about the timing since I only had an hour, but I was done eating in less time than that. (We waited less than ten minutes before our food arrived.) They have fruit infused water for the people waiting, which is a super nice touch for the summer heat. I ordered the Mother Earth bowl with all natural chicken, their chili infused sweet potatoes are to die for!!!! A friend got The Rebel Wrap which has grass-fed steak. Both were amazing and light and didn't make me feel guilty for eating it. They have many teas and house made lemonades to choose from. The cucumber mint lemonade is awesome. I can't wait to go back and try more!",

The menu is a good size...lots of choices for gluten free which I appreciate! I had a quinoa salad with chicken, but asked for no quinoa... I know it sounds odd, but it listed a bunch of veggies, so I hoped they would fill up the bowl.  Um... Nope.  It was very very small, BUT it was delicious!   My husband had the kale salad with salmon... Wow! So good!! He had a nice size portion and the salmon was moist and everything was fresh.  Very very good!  That all being said... It was way over priced. Cost us $30.00 and we didn't have drinks. I do not understand all of these salad places charging so much...lettuce is cheap! Well, they're making money, so that explains that.   Although the food we did have was good, I doubt we will come back.  We left hungry and had to go get something more to eat, so it defeats the purpose of eating healthy.  Besides costing me even more money because I had to buy more food. Bummer.",

Of course their assortment of desserts can definitely get you there.  The seating arrangement is great, and decorating definitely fits theme.  The only negative is that because it is a hot new place for lunch, you might be standing in line a little bit, but they do a great job of managing that.  Finally, my favorite part of the restaurant was the lemonade.  It's stupid how good it is, but don't worry because their 32 is cup has you covered.",

    "text": "We have eaten here a few times.  The food is very, very good.  The quality is excellent.  The staff is plentiful, friendly, and courteous.  They are all well trained.  The problem is that I often leave hungry after spending $50.  Well, not hungry; but not totally satisfied. Last night I ordered the soup of the day - a green curry thai cauliflour thing.  It was very good. However, they filled the bowl less than 1/2.  You pay $6 and get less than 1/2 a bowl.  I brought it back to the line and asked that they fill the bowl.  They did with a smile...but why did I have to ask????  Anyway, the soup was fresh, hot, and delicious.   I also ordered the Vietnamese salad with steak as the protein.  $16. for a salad.  Not super large, but super delicious.  Fresh, great dressing, excellent ingredients.   If they served bread and butter with the salad, it would make all the difference in the world.  Also, I ordered iced tea.  You get the glass and you go and fill up with 6 choices....Not sure how much it was but I bet it was over $3.  But you get refills.  There is some stevia there which you need bc all the choices are unsweetened.  It was fun watching the kids try it...they hate it bc its so natural they are not used to it!!!  All in all I do like this place and I will go back.  Its just very overpriced ($50 for two salads, two iced teas, and a cup of soup)....they also ask for a tip on the receipt when you pay with credit card!!!  Ain't that a hoot?  A tip for taking your order!  They are SUPPOSED TO DO THAT -   I suggest they remove that option.  If I want to give a tip to someone who takes my order I'll do it; but don't make me feel bad the rest of the meal for not tipping the order taker!  But the food is great.  The service is prompt and friendly.  The atmosphere is young and chic, and the outdoor seating area is spacious and comfortable.  Every customer drives a Mercedes and Lexus...tells you about who goes here.",

    "text": "It isn't quite summertime in Phoenix yet, but with temperatures already hitting the triple digits it certainly feels like it.  This is the time of year when I ditch the heavy, deep-fried everything for lighter meals, so it was the perfect time to finally give Flower Child a whirl.  I decided to get there a little early to beat any possible lunch crowd, as I'd read on Yelp that it can get very crowded. 10 minutes prior to opening and there were already a dozen people waiting. Wow. This is quite the popular place. The line moved quickly, and there were employees handing out samples of their Flower Girl Lemonade as we waited. Employees were also going through the line asking if patrons had any questions. Ok, ok. I'm starting to really like you folks.  Once I reached the counter I knew exactly what I wanted. I was given a number, I found a table, and had a seat.  Literally moments (felt like only seconds) later my food arrived at my table by a set of happy hands attached to a smiling face.   The Food. I basically got 3 sides, which came together in a large bowl.    RED CHILI GLAZED SWEET POTATO: If one more place makes an amazing sweet potato dish, I'll be forced to stop my incessant hating on this vegetable.  This dish was highly delectable. My eyes may or may not have rolled into the back of my head after first bite.  It was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy, with neither flavor overpowering the other. Excellent flavor. Superb!  SAUTEED SPINACH: I requested extra garlic and it was perfect.  No bland, rabbit leaves here.  Flavorful, lightly seasoned to perfection, and cooked just right, this dish is Popeye approved.  (These cooks should teach a certain \"soul food\" restaurant how to properly execute sauteed spinach.)   INDIAN SPICED CAULIFLOWER: I requested this dish without the dates and almonds but was told that it was mixed into whatever it was that was served with this dish. For me, this was fine. I am not allergic, I just prefer to avoid them if I can; they (nuts) annoy me for some odd reason. Anyway, I actually forgot that the nuts (dates and almonds) were even supposed to be in this dish until just now as I am writing about it.  I didn't see any.  I didn't taste any.  Either they CAN omit them, or they are so finely ground into the sauce or seasoning that they are undetectable to a non-allergic throat. (Hence, if you have a nut allergy, you shouldn't risk it.)  This dish was quite savory.  Personally, I could have used a stronger (hotter) spice, but the dish was still very good as is. Cauliflowers were not too raw, nor were they over-cooked. They were of a perfect softly crunchy texture, if that makes sense.    DESSERT: They have only one vegan dessert at this time. It's called STRAWBERRY YUZU CHEESECAKE. It's a raw vegan cheesecake topped with a strawberry glaze. Typically, I shy away from raw cuisine, but after reading a Yelp-friend's raving review of this dessert, I gave it a shot and WOWZA! It is truly delicious!  It's sweet, a little tart, and a very good emulation of a baked cheesecake.  I was very impressed. (Side note: Yuzu sounded Japanese so out of curiosity I looked it up. It's a citrus fruit.)  They could use more vegan dessert options, but I'm happy with the vegan raw cheesecake for now.  Basically, I love this place.  Not only was the food pretty amazing (and filling), but the service - friendly, smiling, helpful employees, were all just icing on the proverbial cake, and really made this a 5-star experience.  Vegan items are clearly marked with a yellow circle with a line through it.  The decor is lovely; very  hippie-like.  And dude, there is even a little resting place for your yoga mats!  I especially loved the positive little messages written on their window panes.  Unfortunately for me, great for them, is that apparently everyone else must love it too.  By 11:30am, it was already packed.  Parking lot went \"from 0 to 100 real quick (real quick; real quick).\"  Also, I noticed that once it began to get busy, the employees started passing out numbers and assigning tables (instead of you picking your own).  The kitchen and service staff seemed well-managed; everything was moving so smoothly.   Needless to say, I'll be back.  There is something about the name, Flower Child, that makes me happy.   Although I keep wanting to call it Sunflower, for some reason. Maybe because flowers grow in the sun? I don't know, but I do know that Flower Child has successfully mastered the art of executing flavorful, guilt-free food in a happy, healthy environment, and that is something that I can always support.  My name is Tigra, and I approve this message.",

The interior looks pretty much the same from what I remember, but it's been nearly a year since I tried the other one. The people working there were super nice, giving us samples of raspberry ginger kombucha and cucumber mint lemonade. The kombucha was kind of odd in taste, but the lemonade was so tasty! Also they were giving out free flowers, stickers, and headbands, which was pretty sweet. Sometimes when a place first opens everything moves a bit slow for a while. But everyone working there seemed to know what they were doing. There was a line out the door when I first got there, and it moved pretty fast. I also noticed there were some differences on the menu. They did not have the delicious lentils I got last time! But seemed to have some new stuff. I ordered 3 sides, the sweet potato with bok Choy, the gluten free Mac and cheese, and the watermelon heirloom tomato salad. Portion was small for $9, but everything was delicious. The Mac and cheese was a tad too rich though, but very tasty. My sister got a mushroom pho and she liked it but I didn't like it very much. I also got a bittersweet brownie for dessert and it was delicious. So excited that this location is only like 10 minutes away from me since the other one was so far, I will definitely be back!",

Love all of the great veggie choices.  The first day I had a salad with salmon addition and it was so fresh and tasty.  The salmon was perfect and the miso dressing delish!  The second time I ordered a 3 item plate with green beans, broccoli and mac n cheese.  Yum!  Everything was great.  Had tastes of my friends' dishes too and it was all good.

    "text": "I think I have 9 check-ins here and the last few months.  And I am super happy to report that Postmates picks up and delivers Flower Child!!  Yes, it's pricey, but that is only relative to lower quality food available at so many other restaurants. I already committed many years ago to spend more money on high quality groceries and eat in a way that makes me feel better. So when a nice, happy, clean restaurant with a good patio has food at the same quality that I buy, I'm willing to pay them accordingly.  Flower child is one of the few places I know that I can go to get really high quality, clean, delicious food. I feel nutritionally \"safe\" there - there is nothing for me to make a \"bad\" choice with! There's no falling off the good-nutrition truck because of some tempting food evil calling from the menu. They have a couple of small gluten-free items that are shockingly good if I want to indulge. I actually eat ideally there because the things that I know are best for me are so ridiculously delicious.   At first the portions looked questionable, but every time I finish my meal I am pretty full and I'm glad I didn't have more or I would be overly full.  Food is delivered fast every time. I like the help yourself beverage bar, they make some great daily teas and infused waters! The people who work there are all cheerful and attractive - my son likes going with me because he says the girls who work there are all pretty :-)  BONUS: they have my pellet ice. That might sound trivial, but I have a freakish passion for pellet ice. I fill up my cup to go before I leave just so I can munch it as I head home.",

The reason for this low rating is the customer service at this location was awful! The workers were rude and were not help ful at all!

It was just after 1pm and my friend and I had worked up an appetite at a mid-day yoga class.  We decided on Flower Child due to the location and the fact that we were both wanting something light and healthy...   We walked in to a pretty big line, but it moved fast, and we were able to order, get some iced tea / lemonade (one of my favorite things about this and every Flower Child) and have a seat within 10 minutes.  Our food was delivered shortly after that, and it was as fresh and delicious as always... I had the Chopped Vegetable Salad (+ salmon), my friend had the Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl.  We also shared a side of asparagus because who doesn't love asparagus?!  Yes... this Flower Child has the same menu as the others and yes, it's pretty pricey.  But, you get high quality, healthy food in a clean, casual environment, and all of the delicious iced-tea / lemonade refills you can handle!  Needless to say, I'm a big Flower Child fan!  If you haven't already, try their family style meals and kids meals too... They are a great healthy option compared to what you would usually order elsewhere when you don't feel like cooking!",

The added proteins are a little pricey for the quantity you get, but at least the quality is exceptional.  The bowl was full of many different textures and flavors that melded together very well.  I'd love to try more of their bowl options.  Flower Child proves that healthy can be delicious!",

I ended up deciding on the forbidden rice with chicken, which was amazing! This dish was packed with veggies, chicken, and rice for a filling and healthy meal.

It's a walk up & order- then be seated experience and the staff handles the large crowds with grace and ease. Standouts on the menu for me is the rebel wrap and the olive oil lemon muffin. Kids menu items are reasonably priced- you select a protein and two sides. Ice tea selection is on point and soooooo yummy. They also have lemonades to choose from but no sodas!They have fun things on tap like wine and kombucha. Local beer selection. Overall a delicious & healthy place with great service.",

A blend of garlic and lemon. I also really enjoyed the Indian curry cauliflower, spicy Japanese eggplant, and sweet and spicy sweet potatoes.  Also in the divine category was the avocado hummus blend. It was served with fresh corn, pepitas, and a radish, and the Pita that accompanied it was a perfect soft texture.  And please save room for dessert. As someone who tries to avoid dairy food, it's rare to find delicious nondairy desserts.  Definitely try the olive oil lemon cake.  It was sweet and savory at the same time!  So you may be wondering, why not five stars? The place is a little bit overpriced. For example the aforementioned lemon cake was the size of a cupcake, and they charge three dollars for it!",

My go-to is the grains plate with salmon, gluten-free Mac n cheese, and Brussels sprouts. When the sprouts aren't in season I'll switch to the sweet potatoes.   For something lighter their salads are perfectly portioned. All of them are wonderful!  Be sure to try their fresh lemonade as well!",

I'm sad they don't have the plant based cheesecake anymore-that was incredible!",

    "text": "I visited the other day and was delighted to see the flavorful options for salads, bowls and wraps. I had the flying avocado without tomatoes, the lemon olive oil cupcake and tea (I can't remember the flavor but it was tart and tangy simultaneously).  The wrap was a generous portion and came with a side of greens. I am glad it had the greens as the wrap looked a little flat without them. I like my wraps with lots of crunch. There were many other items that looked tempting and I would have chosen them except for the fact that I am allergic to mushrooms.  The lemon olive oil cupcake was moist and perfectly cooked. It also came with a nice light glaze drizzled on top.  The decor is similar to the trendy farmhouse organic yuppie but charming.  I would have sat inside but the music was a little bit loud. However, the outside patio was the perfect setting for the spring day.  The line increased as lunch drew near and the only downside would be the limited amount of immediate parking. There is a large shopping center adjacent and one could park there and brave the cross traffic.  The value for the food was a little pricey but not uncommon for the area.  As many other yelpers have asked, if they open one in Chandler, I will return.",

You basically choose a protein & can then choose a salad, bowl, or combination of sides to go with it. I've tried the Thai Cashew Quinoa (so much flavor!), the salmon, the Indian Spiced Cauliflower, the Sauteed Spinach, the Simple Sauteed Broccoli and the gluten-free mac n cheese. They were all good & I can't wait to go back again. Their menu is easy to explore since it's actually all stuff that you will like eating...  Finally, you have to try their lemonades!!! SO GOOD.",

    "text": "My mom and I came here for the third time today, and we had a stellar experience. Although Flower Child was busy (we were there at 1 p.m. on a Saturday) and the line to order was long, we got our food quickly and it was great.   Flower Child is different than many other Fox Concept restaurants because you order your food, get a table number, and then have the food delivered to you (much like Sauce). Although it is more fast food \"style,\" the ingredients are of high quality, as are the staff.   The vibe is awesome, very airy and fresh, and, as you might imagine, there are fresh flowers everywhere. The young staff is upbeat and friendly.  Some of the menu items change seasonally, which gives me hope that they actually do try to source their produce as locally as possible. Today, my mom and I shared the Vegan Caesar Salad and the Thai Dye Wrap. The Vegan Caesar Salad was great, with tons of fresh tender kale, veggies, and olives. The lemon tahini dressing was slightly tart, but it was great nonetheless. The Thai Dye Wrap was by far my favorite thing I've ever tried there. Marinated and thinly sliced tofu is paired with creamy avocado slices and Thai basil, then bundled into a soft wrap. I don't usually like tofu, but this was an amazing sweet and slightly spicy creation.   I also love their desserts. I've tried the GF brownies, CC cookies, lemon cakes, and krispie bars, and they have all been nothing less than incredibly delicious.",

It's a shame because the interior is adorable and the menu sounds delicious. The steak was stringy and over cooked, the smashed potatoes were runny, the broccoli was limp and the corn with quinoa was inedible (that may just be my point of view about quinoa, although I have liked it at other places).  April 23, 2017 - on a subsequent visit, the food was substantially better tasting and much fresher. I had a turkey wrap which was quite good and a side of quinoa and corn which was served hot and flavorful. The staff is friendly and the interior is shabby chic adorable.",

I told them what was missing so they went in to retrieve it but the flower child staff told them the only item which was missing was one side of steak, which they provided us with. I checked my order and I was in fact missing 2 potato sides and 1 steak side (which costs $14). Forgetting to give a customer $20 worth of food is not a small mistake and I would have expected the employees to look more carefully at the order especially upon being notified by the customer that they had messed up the order.",

    "text": "Not only does Flower Child encourage healthy eating, but also an active and happy lifestyle at their upbeat location in Scottsdale. Flower Child offers an extensive menu that fits almost any diet, including vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free. They provide locally sourced high-quality ingredients and all natural meat products from responsible producers. In addition to their wide array of food options, Flower Child also makes a line of refreshing teas and lemonades, such as their house made original, rose petal, and cranberry ginger flavors.   At their restaurant, Flower Child offers an order in and take out service for on the go. This is highly convenient for those who are busy, in a rush, or stopping by for a meal break from work. For those dining in, the restaurant's lively atmosphere is enjoyable to consume a well nourishing meal at any time of day. Bright colors, earthy accents, positive sayings, and beautiful paintings can all be seen inside and outside the restaurant. Also, Flower Child has a team of congenial waiters and waitresses who love to serve their customers. They will happily greet you, assign you a number, and allow you to choose your seat, whether it's indoors or outside on the patio.   As a vegetarian, I am often limited to simple salads and other side orders. It is difficult to find the same pure and wholesome ingredients that Flower Child has to offer in their multiple plant-based food options on the menu. Throughout my several visits to this restaurant, I have ordered their Thai Due Wrap, Vegan Ingredient Salad, and also the Mix 'n' Match Plate where I was able to to pick a protein and sides of my choosing.   Although I personally don't see any flaws, I have heard many argue that a negative of Flower Child is their smaller portions and higher price. They strive to meet high food standards that accompany any diet and lifestyle, which results in these outcomes. Smaller portions encourage individuals to not overindulge or overeat, but to eat a balanced and nutritionally dense meal instead. Their higher prices are due in part of their mostly organic ingredients and real quality food that can be seen and tasted.   On my most recent visit, I stopped by to grab a quick lunch. I drove to Flower Child, walked up, and briefly waited in line. I was greeted by a friendly waitress who gave me a table number. After asking me about my day, it was my turn to order, so she ushered me to the ordering counter. Instead of ordering my go to favorite, the Thai Dye Wrap, I decided to try something new. I paid around $10 for my meal and continued to walk to their beverage counter. I filled a cup with water and took some silverware, which were easily accessible to the right of the lemonade dispensers. After, I took a seat towards the front of the restaurant and placed my number on the table. Within ten minutes, another friendly waiter took my number in exchange for handing me my food. My first intention of the Mother Earth Bowl was that it looked fresh and inviting. My first bite into it and I was already in Heaven. It was delicious and I was well pleased with my new food experience.   With my many visits to Flower Child, I am a bit biased of most restaurants. No other restaurant appears to provide the same wholesome and healthy food. Flower Child is definitely my top restaurant contender and go to place for any meal. I highly recommend Flower Child because you will instantly be attracted to their overall atmosphere and vibe, as well as their passion, mission, and food.",

Ingredients are very fresh, veggies still a little crisp, and some very inspired flavor combinations. Also love the lemonade and tea and the fact that you can get refills for free. Reminds me of True food kitchen.   That all being said I have two criticisms:  1. Price - this is essentially a modified fast food restaurant where you order at the counter and they bring you the food. Yet a bowel costs $9 and that doesn't include any meat. I ordered tofu which is the cheapest protein at $4. And btw I got 5 cuts equaling roughly a quarter of a full block of tofu. At the grocery store a block would cost me roughly $2. Also ordered a lemonade so my meal ended up fairly close to $20. That's a little steep for a casual dining place. And the portions are reasonably sized which means you can eat the whole meal in one sitting so no left overs to make you feel like your getting more for your money.   2. When full - which is both times I've been (sun and Tuesday afternoons) - it's pretty loud in the restaurant. Although most of these modern restaurants are just one big room with hard floors so usually are quite loud.   I want to love this place and keep coming but the prices are a little too steep for what you get.",

My mom had suggested it saying that she heard that it was fresh and organic foods. I'm a huge fan of feeling like I am satisfied and not weighed down by my meal so I agreed.   My son ordered the Mac n cheese which was outstanding. It tasted like a strong natural cheese and was a decently sized amount for a hungry kid. The rest of us all ordered a steak wrap each that had greens and either feta or goat cheese. I LOVE goat and feta cheese. The wraps was so good we all devoured them.   The setting is shabby chic modern farm style. I appreciate the order at the front, get a number and they bring the food style. The staff was nice and the place was busy.",

My only complaint is that the prices are high, and it can get crowded around lunch time. All in all, a solid choice if you have the money.",

My husband had the avocado wrap and we ordered an avocado toast to share. Everything was yummy. The restaurant offers wine and beer on tap and has a great selection of fresh lemonades to choose from. It is the kind of restaurant where you order at the counter, are given a number, seat yourself, and your food is brought to you. We only waited about five minutes from the time we ordered until our food was brought to us and this was on a steady Saturday night. They has a fruit infused water stand set up outside to help yourself to in case there was a wait for a table. The patio outside is large enough to accommodate big groups or parties and had misters on to help cool the area on hot summer nights. Most item on the menu are vegan friendly and allow you to add your protein for an additional cost.",

Upon arriving you order your meals first at the counter and they are brought to your table for you. I ordered their curry bowl with chicken while my husband got their Late Riser with salmon. I also ordered one of their fresh juices (the green one). Although they were busy we got our food quickly. Both meals were so amazing and extremely flavorful, we managed to finish every bite!

Pricing is high but understandable based on food choices.  This was my first visit and I tried the tortilla chicken soup bowl and Tai Cashew Quinoa with steak added.  The bowl of tortilla chicken soup was delightful.  The soup was chock full, and healthy. The flavors worked very well with the textures, because the ingredients were so fresh.  For example, the corn in the soup was fresh and crispy with still sweet flavor. The tortillas were still crisp when I started eating as well. The entire soup was top notch.  The tai quinoa was nice, with a nice light spicy bite, and the added steak was excellent. My goal was protein, which is why I added the steak. The flavors were clean and clear and the steak strips were hot and juicy.   I really enjoyed the meal here, even though the prices were easily twice what I would expect for a lunch. The simple fact is that I paid for the flavor excellence and the healthy ingredients throughout. My son and I both ate lunch here, which was probably a larger size than most would need (we each had the tai quinoa main entree with an additional side- me, the soup; him, the gluten free mac and cheese). Our bill total came to right at $50.",

I thought it might cater more to vegans but the menu had a ton of variety! And even though I am not vegan, if you are, the variety and selection of vegan items was impressive! And if you are a carnivore? They have steak and chicken on the menu too. Loved finding this gem! The service was friendly, helpful, and very customer focused. Exactly what I appreciate in a restaurant. It was my first time here, so I asked the young lady at the counter for some recommendations and how to order, and she could not be more enthusiastic and helpful! I ordered the plate with spicy Japanese eggplant, roasted curry cauliflower, and topped with salmon. The salmon was cooked perfectly! Not over cooked. Slightly crispy on the very outside and flaked off in my fork. Delicious! The cauliflower was cooked well, but I would not have minded a touch more curry flavor but it was very good. The surprising highlight for me was the eggplant! Amazing!!!! Spicy but not TOO spicy. Cooked perfectly...not too crunchy and not too mushy...and a little extra flavor with cashews. Craving it again already! The outdoor patio was perfect on this night (Wednesday, September 11, 2019...about 80), with mild but warm weather. The inside is cute and bright and they have interesting teas and lemonades, but I just had water so cannot review any drinks. Prices are not cheap...but for the quality of the food received...I didn't feel the prices were obscene. I failed to get a picture but I highly recommend this place and especially the salmon and eggplant. I will be back!",

I was looking for healthy lunch options and Flower Child came highly recommended on Google.  They have tons of vegan/gluten free options but during my first visit I went with a lil protein (the Flying Avocado which is a turkey wrap) and some veggies on the side (their sauteed spinach is wonderful; paired it with their brussels sprouts which they no longer sell.) The 2nd time I came I tried the Bird is the Word wrap (chicken + charred onion - so good) along with mashed potatoes. I have not tried a single dish at this place which I did not devour immediately.  FYI - Flower Child gets busy during lunch time. Your best bet is to phone ahead if you want take out...you'll thank me later. If you need to dine in, do yourself a favor and don't go at noon; get there right at 11:30 and you should be fine.",

And tho it was busy and the line  to order was long, it still works, with easy ordering and an easy sit-down. They are very smart to find tables for you while you are on line to order & then reserve that empty table for you with a table number sign. SO after you order, you sit immediately and have your order brought to you. Again, so smart! Other places should take note. And the food was GREAT! I ordered 3 sides for $9- delish mac n cheese (gluten free), the Indian spiced cauliflower and a fantastic golden beet & avocado salad with citrus dressing- so good! And the 3 sides made a full meal at a great price. Ask for the free Pita bread too. Lots of other choices- salads, wraps & bowls that are all veggie & grain oriented but you can add a choice of proteins (including salmon!) and tofu for an extra charge. Very veg & vegan friendly. I am totally going back soon. And I'd like to try to original Flower Child on 44th St & Camelback.",

This isn't low cal food, this is healthy living food. There is a big difference. If you're counting calories and think you'll save a few here, you'll be disappointed. If you like to eat in cohesion with a healthy lifestyle, this is your place. Their ingredients are fresh and the best quality. The ingredients are rich in vitamins and everything that is good for your body. My two favorite items on the menu are the flying avocado wrap and the curry, yes the curry! Sam Fox does an amazing curry and I don't know how he does it (I like the one from True Food too). This Flower Child has a great grab and go section and their takeout is always spot on. I also enjoy their to go parking right in front. I enter through the to go door, pay and take my food. I'm in and out stat, which is good that they have it perfected since a hospital is across the street. My weakness? Their olive oil lemon cake. I can never seem to resist.",

The steak wrap is fair, I shared with my husband. The price is crazy high. It must come out to $50 a pound. There is maybe 1 oz of chicken in the wrap. .....There is no food.  So if you are on a diet go here with no guilt. If you are starving .....good luck.  I complained so they gave me a sandwich to go.  I opened it when I came home. No food.  My cat had more protein than I.  The ambiance was fair.  The servers were working like slaves.  The drinks are very expensive. No ceiling fans. We are still in a  freakin hot desert. Fox restaurants are poorly designed for the climate. The chair backs are rounded so get ready to keep you purse on the ground. Standing in line is horrible, I had a mother behind me that kept snapping at my heels with her baby carriage. For the price you are getting nothing. We paid over $90 for ZERO food.  The interior design is designer hippie fake.......just like the name. more like a Disney land themed restaurant. They have a yoga Matt basket by the front door, need I say more?  This is just marketing , the food is salty. High in calories, overpriced. The drink station is crowded.",

I called and spoke with Amy, the manager, and she was ON IT TO MAKE THIS GAL HAPPY!  Not only did she comp the meal in question before it posted to my account, she gave me a free meal to come back any time I was ready.  I went back today.  WOW!!!  AWESOME BEYOND!!!  She even had me step back to check out my TO Go before bagging that yummiest delight up to be sure it was going to make me happy.  I felt I was treated like a queen and felt like a HUGE queen at home as I devoured every last AMAZING morsel.  This place is 20 stars above.  I was so excited to find them...had a hiccup that was MORE THAN rectified...and have now become a patron for LIFE!!!  LONG LIVE FLOWERCHILD!!!!!  Amy, you are a REAL AND TRUE ROCKSTAR!!!  AWESOME STAFF, FABULOUS ENERGY!!!  BEST EVER and healthy and YUMMY to boot!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!!!!  THANK YOU!  HIGH FIVE TO MANAGER AMY!!!!!!  See y'all SOON!!!  :)))  Did I say...LOVE!!!

Way overpriced first off. 7$ for a salad seems reasonable until you realize that's without meat. tack another 5-6$ on top for the meat. And for a place that touts healthy food, the sides are all chock full of sodium. I have never had saltier asparagus, and that was not a one time only experience. I have suffered through the salty asparagus at least 6 times now. Long lines and waits, staff is not necessarily the brightest or friendliest, and we have had multiple catering orders not prepared correctly. Also once the staff gave us grief about ordering the food on the phone 3 hours in advance for 10 people saying it was not enough time. 3 hours is not enough time? Wow. This place is the flavor of the month for Scottsdale. People go for the name, but the food is not worth it. A shame as Sam Fox restaurants are typically spot on. If I can avoid coming here I will.",

Food is fresh and thoughtfully prepared.  I follow AIP and they were happy to modify my meal to ensure compliance (Vegan Cesar Salad with Salmon, no seeds no tomatoes).   Don't be alarmed by the line out the door as they are very efficient and unlike other fast casual concepts (think Chipotle and Panera) you don't have to stress out over where to sit: a hostess will direct you to an open table and the food is delivered within moments.  The fresh Kombucha was refreshing. A \"miss\" and it's an interesting one is the decision to leave calorie and nutrition information off the menu.  Even if loaded with disclaimers, calorie, fat, sugar and protein information would have been great to know- Mod Market does this in Colorado on the back of the receipt.  I hope this concept expands to other areas.",

Both my kids had the mac and cheese with mashed potatoes and a choice of meat.  The desert selection is pretty decadent too.   The atmosphere is an informal, swanky, hippie. Think the hippie who spends $300 for ripped jeans.   It is a little pricey...$8 for my salad, $4 for the side. You have to wait in line to order, then it is served to your table on (nice) plastic (correction - bamboo) plates and bowls. But, the freshness and creativity make up for it.   Service is friendly and they're on top of getting the empties out of our way. Definitely worth a visit when you're in a healthy mood.",

It's a healthy, fast food concept. You order and pay, they give you a number, and then bring your food to you. The menu has a lot of veggie, vegan, and gluten free options. And the place is seemingly never not crowded. Seriously.  I tried a bunch of the sides, all of which were tasty. I'm assuming that the sides vary by season, but the standouts for me were the brusseI sprouts and the indian spiced cauliflower. I also tried the thai cashew quinoa bowl which was a really large portion and had good flavor.  I can see why this restaurant is so popular-it's a good, healthy choice for eating out.",

As I scanned the menu - it was difficult to determine what one item I should order as there were just too many seemingly good (and healthy) options!! After we all discussed and decided (we promised to each order separate items and share to ensure the broadest taste experience)- I landed on the Late Riser (much like a Mexican breakfast bowl). Very flavorful and filling - I would order it again. My friend had the GF Mac and Cheese (side - which was very small and not extremely impressive) and the Mother Earth Bowl (yum yum yum - so good). I also had a glass of organic white wine (ok fine I had 2 glasses) and left with a brownie (per the suggestion of the cashier). Fully satisfied with everything we consumed! The place was really busy (not overwhelming, however) so I'm glad to see its doing well! I hear there is one coming to Santa Monica (close to me - as I live in LA) and I can't wait to try that location later this Summer!!",

    "text": "This was my first time here and the atmosphere is fresh. It's modern but has a farm fresh vibe with a variety of tables configured both inside and out on a shaded patio. We were here before five and it's busy and people working here are moving at breakneck speed. The menu is overwhelming but inviting. Lots of choices and gluten free is clearly marked. I settle in on a glass of Melbec and a strawberry fields salad with chicken ($13). My husband orders a glass of beer and a burrito bowl with no protein. We order at a counter, pay and get our drinks and silverware but are asked on our receipt if we want to tip. Umm --No-- no for delivering a salad to me. I waitressed my way through college in restaurants where we had to do everything, including bus the table and serve desserts. No I don't think someone is entitled to a tip for bringing out our salad. The salad when it comes is good. It's fresh and has a nice presentation. But is it worth $13? I'm not sure? I've been sitting here sipping my 6 Oz MAlbec and our bill was $36.70 and I'm still hungry. My husbands burrrito bowl was ($9) without a protein. He said it was good but not any better than chipotle, which would have been much larger and have a protein. It was good, but definitely Scottsdale prices-- not sure this business model would work in Tucson-- unless a price adjustment was in order!",

I ate the Forbidden Rice Bowl and it reminded me a lot of the Protein Bowl from The Chop Shop. (Which I also love.) I loved their large selection of teas and lemonades. I have to mention their restrooms because I personally am a firm believer in equality: They had a sign on the bathroom that basically said 'boy and/or girl' so anyone could use either restroom (keep in mind they are individual and private restrooms) It showed me the culture at Flower Child/ Fox Concepts were for equality and I LOVED that! 'Love is in the details!'",

Also, their teas and lemonades are delicious!! I love having choices and they definitely give you plenty!

    "text": "We enjoy Flowerchild and have been to this  concept several times. Our most recent visit was Saturday, January 5. Everything was good in terms of food quality though the prices have far exceeded the value lately. When food gets pricy the guest tends to strengthen their standards for quality, presentation, service levels and of course value. Flowerchild offers small portions and although the flavors are amazing there just isn't enough food. We had a salad, appetizer and two lemonades for $37. No bread or anything unique to accommodate the salad, really? I realize Fox doesn't want to do a \"me too\" concept though I left hungry for the second time recently and this time it is firmly planted in my memory to avoid such experiences. Many  concepts have caught up with this one and offer more unique offerings along with a bit more portion and value for money spent. There appears to be a lack of management as well as it would be nice to see a manager visibly available and attentive to show appreciation to guests like myself and my family.",

On one hand the vegetarian choices are 4 stars for sure, but anything with fish or meat leaves so much to be desired and is not over 2 stars on a good day.   I've been here a few times and every dish I've had without meat has been awesome. Everything. However, I added salmon to one order and I received salmon with more than a dozen bones in it. I figured it was a fluke, but ordered steak the next time. The steak was so tough I couldn't chew through it, let alone swallow it.   They are still new so I am hoping they will get their act together in terms of the meat. I the meantime, I'm not in a rush to try this place again, unless I feel like a strictly vegetarian dish.",

The food is fresh and tasty, but the only way you can eat here for less than $15 per person is to not add any protein, drinks, or desserts to your meal. And given the portion size (about which I had been warned), you might leave still feeling hungry--or perhaps not completely satisfied.   As far as the food, the Mother Earth with salmon added and the Late Riser are both good choices. The Late Riser is filling enough for lunch, but might not be enough food for dinner. The plus is that it's great without adding any additional protein, but I'm guessing it would be good with chicken. The flavors of the Mother Earth paired well, but even with the salmon, I found myself eating every last bite and wondering if I still needed to order something else.  I love the concept and the atmosphere of this place, but just not enough to take the hit to my bank account very often.",

I spent months salivating over the fact that Flower Child would be within WALKING DISTANCE FROM HOME. All that build-up would have to lead to some sort of disappointment, right?  WRONG.  It's perfect--if you can go at a time where there isn't a balls-long line out the door.  Our first visit was a Friday for early dinner. We arrived around 5:30 p.m. (I'd been sick all week so I just wanted to eat early and sleep early--lay off my grandparent dinner-time, OK?!) Even at the early hour, there were several tables filled in the dining room, and the patio was about half-full as well. A good, good sign.  The inside is so cute. You're sitting in someone's open, breezy, sunny, clean room and waiting for food perfection. The decor is clean and cute.  I decided on the Thai Dye wrap: tofu, Thai basil (my FAVORITE), avo, carrot, radish, cilantro, snap peas. Their homemade wheat/flax/chia wraps are the absolute best. Fiance went with the Flying Avocado wrap: chicken, smoked Gouda, romaine, tomato, avocado hummus(!). We were both enamored with our fresh our wraps were and how tasty everything was. We also decided to split the Thai cashew quinoa bowl. This was absolutely outstanding. Perfectly cooked and amazingly seasoned red quinoa tossed with a variety of \"Asian-y\" vegetables (Shiitakes and snap peas stood out), mixed with cashews for the perfect crunch. Add a protein onto this and you're golden for a meal.  Oh, and the flavored iced teas/lemonade/not a soda to be found? Refreshment-face.  Sounds good, right? Well, good enough to RETURN FOR TAKE-OUT LUNCH THE NEXT DAY! Hey, when we find something we love, we love it. At 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon there was a line to the door, so we called in our order while we ran some errands to take up the 35 minute wait time. We returned 25 minutes later to find our food packaged up and ready to go.  2nd round: Chopped vegetable salad with added tofu for me. Probably my new favorite salad. Everything is so dang FRESH, and the miso vinaigrette packed such a lovely punch. Hippie Chick wrap for him. Apparently FC's version of the chicken salad is the best he's ever had. We tried a side of sesame soba noodles for kicks. So tasty, and perfectly portioned!  Do you think we're obsessed enough? Well, we're planning on picking up dinner after I get out of a late meeting tomorrow. So yes, we are three-trips-in-one-week happy that Flower Child has arrived!",

We apprecaited that they served local beer opposed to the standard grocery store selections.   The service was alright - the cashier was underage and couldn't ring us up. She seemed to have a moment of panic and shouted behind for help, but they figured it out.   The food came out quickly and was cooked well. The location provides tasty, healthy options. While on the higher end of cost for salads and wraps, it's somewhere we would consider going again.",

The staff was friendly and the food was overall great. The menu looked so good it was difficult to decide on what to get. I finally went with the Flying Avocado wrap  which I loved. It was flavorful and tasted light. The portion is pretty big so you might have some left overs. I also got the Indian Spiced Cauliflower on the side.  I thought it was ok. It tasted to cauliflowerey (I know I'm making up words).  Usually when I eat cauliflower it's fried and and unhealthy. I can't wait to come back and try something else!",

Love the salad...so many different textures and taste.  Nothing over powered the other items.  The first time I came here, my husband was with me.  He ordered Plates - pick two with steak.  The one thing noticeable about the plate when it arrived was how SMALL the portion was.  He said the food was good but it was not enough for him.  I don't think it would have been enough for me either.  By the way, we're not big eaters.",

It's across the street from Shea Honor Health, which must be super nice and convenient for hospital employees, patients and visitors.   Always great service. It gets pretty busy during lunchtime so expect a line. They do a great job of managing and seating customers in line. Also very considerate that they offer fruit infused water for customers. Dine in and enjoy their casual dining or call ahead for take out and skip to their special takeout-only line.   I've been here countless times and the food is so fresh and yummy. Everything I've ever had is always quite delicious. Be sure to try their house lemonades - you can mix them and they also have crushed ice which earns bonus points in my book.  Some of favorites include the grains and greens salad, Mother Earth bowl, kale salad, and their soups are phenomenal --especially the Moroccan chickpea soup - my God it's good!   I am super bummed they removed my very favorite grains and greens salad from the menu and I hope they decide to bring it back soon because it was soooo good! To management: please please please considering putting it back on the menu!",

They have a sweet selection of teas and lemonade drinks. I love to mix the black tea with one of their watermelon or rose lemonades.   For the entree, I get the cashew chicken bowl with forbidden rice. For the bowls, you can pretty much mix and match with the veggies of one, the sauce of another, and the rice/quinoa of another. They never act like this is a big deal either, which speaks to their level of customer service. Then you pick a protein. I've never had any of their wraps, but just a couple bits of others' in my party.   What I will say is that this place is pricey. Yes, all of their stuff may be organic and top notch quality, but don't be fooled by the fact that it's a walk-up order type of restaurant, you will still pay typical restaurant prices. This is great if you want to have this as takeout for work, which many of their customers do.   The patio is dog friendly and has misters.   The kids menu allows you to pick a protein and a couple sides (ranging from mac and cheese to healthier options like apple slices and a clementine).  Also notable: though it has never been an issue for me, some of the people I've dined with have complained about the noise level and the difficulty hearing.",

    "text": "We stopped here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. My son likes this place and recommended it. Since we were close by we decided to try it.   When we got there, there was a huge line almost out the door. Figuring this place out, you order and pay then they find you a table. Ordering process seemed like Hop Doddy. So I was cool with this. My son said that when they aren't busy then you find our own table. So little different.   The only thing that made me a little uncomfortable was when someone was going down the line talking to each party and how many they had. When she got to us, we told her we had 3. Then right away she told us to jump the line and go to the front. Now, I really don't like doing this but the woman lead us to the front. Still didn't like this but I complied. Only problem is that I really didn't get a chance to look over the menu which is above the ordering counter. So I had to hurry up and decide.   I ordered the Forbidden Rice which had snap peas, bok choy, broccoli, carrots, onions, and I added chicken. It was pretty good. Pretty healthy dish and a pretty big portion which filled me up. Everything was fresh. I thought it was good. Not great but good. Chicken was cold and really didn't have a lot of taste. Like I said the dish was good.   My son and wife both ordered the Mother Earth. They both liked it and my son always orders this. It had sweet potato, mushrooms, avocado, and cucumber plus other stuff. No complaints here.   Overall, the food was good, fresh, and healthy. Service was good especially since they made us jump to the front of the line. You get your own drinks and they bring your food. So it we had a pretty good time. Good food and great company. So we will probably be back. Enjoy and eat healthy.",

I had the Salmon and added the Gluten Free Mac and Cheese with Parmasean Broccoli.  Everything was fresh and flavorful.  Clearly you get correct portions so dont expect a ton of food, which is a good thing.  However, my only complaint is the bill is not portion sized.  I paid $18 for that with a bottle of water.  I couldn't believe it was that much for a simple little lunch.  That is the only reason I dropped it one star.  I might come back, but for a $18 lunch it wont be often.",

I noticed everyone was really enjoying their meals. I want one of everything I thought but I ordered the grilled salmon with mash potatoes and sauteed spinach.....  We took our number and sat down.... I walked to the beverages in the back of the Restraurant only to see an array of natural drinks.... like freshly squeezed lemonade, fresh brewed ice tea in peach and strawberry, coconut water.....I'm loving this place already.....   As I returned to table I was a little surprised by the portion size of the food....The portions were great for me but if your an adult male who's looking to get their grub on.... Turn around and go back to the car!!! This place is portion controlled.... No doggie bags here!!!!   The salmon, spinach and mash potatoes were neatly placed in a bowl... YES... A bowl not a plate but boy it PACKED A PUNCH!!!!   It was very good and satisfying to say the least.  Look if your looking for a healthier and cleaner eating experience this is the place for you!",

I will say that the atmosphere is spot on and exactly what I love. The food was great, but I was pretty bummed about the portion size when considering what it cost. I totally understand that healthier options are often a bit more costly than a different restaurant, but I came here starving and left still hungry. This place would be perfect for someone who wants something a bit light and not a full on meal - maybe after coming from yoga or the gym?

I picked up dinner tonight instead of staying to eat.  I ordered the sweet corn quinoa, which is typical for me to order.  When I opened the container I could tell that it had a rotten sour smell to it.  I called the restaurant to let them know that I had to toss it and that they should probably let someone know.  Not sure it mattered - I was made to feel like it was stupid of me to call.    This restaurant is pricey, which I will pay for if the food is great food.  I also would expect that management would want the staff to make a customer that picked up $50 of food worth listening to.    They need to get back to the beginning when the staff was more attentive and serious and the food was consistent.",

I know this is a big corporate restaurant group cashing in on the \"healthy\" eating trend so not sure they care as much about health as their concept would lead you to believe but they have an amazing opportunity to try and do some genuinely good things for the planet. How about starting by changing the plastic takeout containers? Not only is plastic such wasteful landfill but it's really bad for our bodies. Even paper boxes would be so much better. Why put a tiny piece of avocado toast in a plastic box that someone is going to immediately throw away? How about leading by example and not just pretending to be a healthy place??",

The kale salad, macaroni & cheese, and tomato & watermelon salad are among my favorites.   Each time I visit, whether dine-in or take-out, the visit is pleasant and the employees are phenomenal. This was especially displayed in my most recent visit when I paid for my meal with a gift card, however there was a mistake with the register that said I owed $6 extra dollars, which was incorrect. After much confusion and trying to figure out the issue, the sweet girl at the register determined that Flower Child was at fault and refunded the necessary money, as well as gave me a free kombucha! This restaurant goes above and beyond for customer service and their food is the best in the area. I will continue to recommend this place to everyone I meet and will be back often!",

She knew the menu top from bottom when I asked questions about it, considering this was my first time at the establishment  & the service was impeccable. We gathered our seats and gazed at the art work and lights that consumed the building. Our server George treated us with incredible service and kindness. He made sure to ask if we were comfortable and secure with our meal. Izzy, the host from earlier in the night stole a second from the front to ask us how my experience has been so far. She went above and beyond to make sure this dining experience was one to remember. Flower Child has delightful cuisine as much as service. Amazing experience all around !!!",

Have tried the forbidden rice bowl with shaved beef.  It's been consistently good as is the Rebel which is a grass fed steak wrap.  Tried the madras curry with steak added, but wouldn't repeat that one.  It has more potatoes than anything.  The Kombucha beverage is very tasty.  They even have several gluten free desserts.  Have tried the brownie and lemon cake, both warrant repeats.  This is a place where you order your food at the counter then grab a table and they bring your order to you when it's ready.  The dishes have always been served hot.  Know that it is an incredibly noisy restaurant to visit so no relaxing here.  Would be nice if they invested in some noise reduction materials in the ceiling.  They only have two bathrooms that are unisex, but they are usually clean.",

I had the chopped vegetable salad with tofu added ($4 to add tofu, $7 to add salmon, and similar prices to add chicken or steak) and everything was incredibly fresh and delicious.  The dressing was fantastic, and the avocado really added a lovely creamy texture to a delicious, crunchy salad.  I just wish that it wasn't so expensive, because then I could justify going all of the time, but paying $11 for a salad just doesn't feel right.  When you think about all of the ingredients being incredibly fresh and organic (I think) it justifies it more.  While I will most definitely be back to try more dishes, I won't be making it a habit just because it would be an expensive one.  Definitely worth a try due to all of the unique, healthy, and delicious choices Flower Child offers.",
