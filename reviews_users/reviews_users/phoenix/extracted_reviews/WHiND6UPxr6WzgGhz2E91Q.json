The waffles to the scramblers to the corn beef and hash was all on point.   Super fun experience with our extended family and cant thank Dominic enough for his hospitality and warm atmosphere.    It's why we frequent this location.",

The service was of normal service. One of the Managers, Domenic, came out to greet us. Very welcoming and held good conversation. He made his rounds to ensure everyone was taken care of. The food was mediocre, I had the corn beef hash. Otherwise, this place was great.",

They have a DJ on FRI SAT SUN which at first I was like, really, nothing like what I expected.  Iceman is an awesome DJ, they have a disco ball and Bloody Mary bar and awesome drinks, try the blueberry mimosa yum delish !!

No big deal, ordered food and specifically asked for no onions and saw the waitress write it down so knew she heard me.  My hash meal arrived and it had onions in the food.  Easy enough to pick them out but if I had a food allergy and someone served me food that I requested be removed in preparation it could have had serious consequences.  The food was meh.  Never saw the waitress until time to pick up plates and check in before the check is settled. Not that this was an excuse for a reduced meal cost but the waitress didn't seem to care after I pointed it out and no gesture on behalf of the restaurant to bring my experience into the realm of average.  I don't write many reviews but this was so disappointing that others should be made aware of at least my experience.  Perhaps this review will communicate that the wait staff should be more sensitive to customers who can't eat certain foods normally prepared in their standard menu.  Sorry Hash, perhaps this was an example of a bad day and this is not typical? Regardless, this was my first and last meal at your restaurant. Sorry, it was just awful.",

The dishes are super flavorful with awesome presentation. We came on a Sunday and there was a DJ. Domenic took care of us, getting us a seat at the busy bar.  The only downside was that the frozen drink machine was broken, so we weren't able to have a mimosa slushie, but the mimosa flight was great!  This was our 4th time here, but our first time on the weekend. The team looks like they really enjoy working here. The guests are very friendly with each other. We saw multiple tables talking to each other and asking about what they had to eat or drink. Such a great experience!",

The food here is exceptional in that the flavors and combos are both creative and tasty. But Oh the experience  !!! Domenic in guest relations, and our server Kendra saw to every fun detail. We had a blast with the Bloody Mary buffet - dont miss it ! I bring all my friends here because there just isnt anything else like it. Music is pumping and it makes you want to get up and dance. I wonder if that's aloud.........?? Anyway dancing or not you'll be back.",

    "text": "My sister and I met here for breakfast on a weekday morning and we had a lovely time. The staff were attentive and helpful, and the food was good.   I got the French Press coffee, which I would have preferred stronger but I really like a proverbial punch in the face with my coffee.    I also ordered the Avocado Toast and it was rather stunning. It was 2 huge slices of fried brioche bread with avocado, braised pork, bacon, a fried egg and crispy leeks (the leeks were a first for me). It also came with a green Chile hollandaise. I recommend sharing or planning on taking a piece home because it truly was enormous.  It was also delicious. It read on the menu that it would have bacon jam but instead it just seemed to have 2 thick slices of bacon. I didn't complain, though the bacon jam would have been a nice touch.  My sister ordered a Blueberry Mimosa, which she enjoyed, and the original French Toast. This was the same brioche bread they used for my avocado toast, so this was also a huge serving. I think there were 3 pieces total. I didn't taste it but she said it was good.  Domenic, the Manager, came and spoke to us for a bit. He's a transplant from the E. Coast and loves AZ so far.  You can tell he really cares about each person's experience.  We'll definitely go back. For now I would rate the service a 5 and the food a 4.   I wish I'd taken more pics.",

There is only one table that could seat us all. A bit crowded, but it was located in its own little area to the side of the main restaurant so it was nice to feel cozy and be able to hear everyone at the table.   Everyone enjoyed their selection. Portions are generous and the presentation on each plate was appetizing. The French toast was the big winner for fun!  The Bloody Marys were great. Prices are a bit on the high side, but quality is there.   Our server, Amy, was efficient and got everything right (with a group this large we almost always have errors on the separate checks).  Dominick, the manager, was impressive. He greeted us early on and then checked back more than once to be sure everything was perfect.   We will be back, and bring our husbands next time. One request: open a restaurant in our area - Queen Creek!",

Flavorful and the carnitas didn't have a lot of fat (that's how I like it, I hate lots of chewy fat). We ordered the mimosa flight. They hit the spot and I got a nice buzz from them. The canoli pancakes were alright. I loved the carnitas hash more. My sister got the avocado toast. Talk about HUGE. The portions here are large which is nice to share with others especially when you can't decide between savory or sweet as your brunch entree. When we came, the a/c was broken so that was the only part that made it unpleasant. Service was friendly and attentive. We waited like 45 min on a Saturday. I've been living in California for 4 years, so I've had my fair share of great restaurants. I'm happy to see AZ stepping it up with food especially in my hometown.

A week later, I made sure I snack on something before the long wait, surprisingly we got seated in less than 5 minutes. Yay!  I ordered a corn beef hash and it has too much potatoes for my taste. I wish it had more beef in it. The Avocado sandwich was so huge we could barely finished one of the two. I highly recommend a party of two to share this meal. If you like to drink, they do have a huge bar. They service was great, the restaurant is trendy looking, but the music was way too loud. We literally had to yell across the table and eventually decided not to speak at all until we left the place. If you want to have conversation with friends during breakfast, I will not recommend it. If you want to hang out enjoying alcohols and loud music, this is the place to be.   I probably will not order the same dish again, but do plan on coming back and try their pancakes or toasts. I saw other tables ordering it and it sure looked delicious.",

He spoke to us before and after our meal to ensure it was all up to standard. I've never had such a welcome customer service at a restaurant.  The carnitas hash was very good. Crispy fried onions, creamy avocado, and fresh cilantro really elevated the plate. If anything, the carnitas could've had more of that coke-braised marinated flavor; but it was far from flavorless.   The mimosa flight was fun, and each flavor was refreshing, and just boozy enough. Speaking of booze, the 25oz Mega Boba Mimosa was unexpectedly entertaining to share. BUT, my favorite drink was the Captain Crunch Shooter. Captain crunch with cinnamon cream rum was to die for... and I'm lactose intolerant! I don't care for bloody marys, but they have an expansive bloody mary bar, if you so fancy.   I was really impressed with the service and food upon my first visit to Hash Kitchen. Next time: I'll order a Hash with a side of Reese's pancakes. No judgement, right?",

I was told it would be a 40 minute wait, but based on what I could see I knew it would be worth the wait. After walking outside, the SWEETEST manager Domenic came to ask if we'd be willing to sit at the open bar seats as it would be a faster option than a 40 minute wait for a table. He personally walked us over and made sure we were content. Throughout the 2.5 hour stay (Yes, we were in no rush to leave enjoying both the food and company), Domenic came and checked in with us multiple times. In addition, the waitstaff was overall charismatic and informative.   Atmosphere: I felt like Scottsdale came to Chandler!  Trendy, modern, and a great DJ. It wasn't a \"party\" scene like Old Town, but a great atmosphere (again we were there 2.5 hours!!) that you didn't want to leave. The whole room had grins ear to ear.   Food: I ordered the Avocado Toast and OH. MY. GOSH! Delicious!! And so much food! I could barely finish one slice and took the other one home for leftovers. Plenty of food for the price and it came in a timely manor for being so busy!   We will definitely be coming back. If there is ever a restaurant I want to \"show off\" for an out-of-towner this will be the place!",

Waited for about 15 minutes to be seated that was after getting up to tell the hostesses that other people that arrived after us were being seated before us. Her explanation was that the parties were smaller than ours (we had 4 in our party) even though I clearly saw at least 3 tables that seated 4 or more, available, when I got up to speak with the hostesses. As soon as you go inside there's a DJ blaring music. The music did vary but was a bit loud. It was hard  for our server to hear us. I did notice a Bloody Mary bar with a ton of ingredients available. I went with a tea. I would've loved to try the Bloody Mary bar but it was a bit pricey, 34.00 for a 32oz glass (go big or go home is my motto!) I can't remember what I ordered but it was a breakfast. I wasn't impressed with the portion size for the price. Looking around I did notice that the burgers and sandwiches were a good size. If I go back, I'll order a burger or sandwich instead. Over all the atmosphere was fun. I'm glad I tried it, not sure if I'll go back.",

    "text": "Never heard of this place before today. I had a lunch meeting scheduled here with some co-workers and a vendor. Looked at the menu and photos beforehand to get an idea of what they offered so I was excited to try it out. Upon arrival we sat in back near the restrooms and kitchen; there was a lot of foot traffic. The windows are not tinted and it's extremely bright and there is a lot of glare inside. Table was large and sat us 7 comfortably. We started with the bacon board; this thing I absolutely loved so I was even more amped for the meal. The bacon is thick and tastes just right. Comes with a few small bagels, some Brie, and bacon jam. We all ordered our meals and it took about 20 minutes to get our food. I was the last of the 7 to get their meal and my dish came out about 4-5 minutes after the first dish came to the table. I ordered the Cuban sandwich with fries. Snapped my obligatory photos for yelp and then took a huge bite and noticed something was off...hmmmm...that's weird. \"I taste mayo\" I thought to myself. Sure thing, I look at the bread and both sides are slathered in it. I look again at the menu and the Cuban comes with grain mustard. At that point with almost everyone else at my table finished with their meals I scrapped the bread (I personally think mayo is the most disgusting thing in the planet) and just ate the ham and pulled pork. After I ate I politely spoke with the manager and explained what happened; he said the grain mustard is actually a mayo/mustard mixture. The mix that was spread on my sandwich was all white...no yellow in sight. I was disappointed because the ciabatta looked so dang good! Alas, those things happen but I informed the manager they should probably change the description on the menu to say such. My co-workers said their meals were mediocre; one said his skillet came with onions even though the dish was not listed on the menu as having onions. I might stop in again and try a breakfast item.",

For 2 bloody Mary's it was $15, kinda steep if you ask me, but they were really tasty. Expect to wait over and hour easily. There was a Dj on Sunday that played some good music.

Our server (I believe Kendra was her name) was on top of her stuff and gave us great service. My boyfriend got a free dessert for his birthday, too and it was delicious.   I thought the chicken and waffles were pretty great, and would recommend the mimosa flight if you're not a big Bloody Mary person.   The atmosphere was lively and there was a live DJ.

My husband's huevos rancheros we're also delicious. I also had the blueberry mimosa which paired perfectly with the dance club vibe.

What I received was.. carved turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy.. my order was way wrong. It sound yummy but was completely heavy and non complimentary of flavors. When our waitress asked how our food was I asked her politely if my order was incorrect. After minutes of scrambling and confusion the manager came to our table to tell us they ran out of cornbread cakes. So simple yet not communicated to me because I happily would have ordered another dish.  Second, we ordered carved turkey with stuffing waffles and we received a regular Belgian waffle. Totally bogus. No comp, no apologies, no communication.  Long story short, we happily won't return.",

We finally get seated an hour later. We order Bloody Marys. Which is an amazing bar. Music is a little loud but it was very good. Food is Average nothing that would make me come back. You can get the same for few dollars less anywhere. My vegetarian friend had the Quinoa burger, she said it was very bland, not a lot of flavor.

We are well aware of how popular brunch is on a Sunday, especially at a new place.  We got there at 11am, got our buzzer and found a seat our quoted wait time of 1hour and 15 minutes and were totally ok with it.  Well, at about an hour in we asked for an update on time and were told 'we're just waiting for a big party to leave'.  Now, any good wait staff knows how to seat tables and the manager should have known better. So they have maybe 2 tables that seat 6-7 people without having to push tables together or bring an extra...but they were literally waiting for those big parties to leave before seating us.  We saw several opportunities for them to maybe hold off on a two-top to accommodate us with a couple smaller tables in the same grouping which would have been perfect but nope, none of the four ladies standing at the check-in counter thought of that. So after the hour and 15 minutes wait time with no end in sight we stood and saw no clear tables. A lady approached and apologiozed but made it a point to say they were still within the quoted wait time. LOL. After that lack of good friendly customer service, we left and went to a delicious Mexican Restaurant right next door that was featured on 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.",

I enjoyed my fried chicken dish however it was a little dry. Otherwise their mimosas are phenomenal and their hue is rancheros is fabulous in flavor and aesthetic!

I've been there before and the food is pretty good, but hardly any food is worth 1+ hour wait time. And no food is worth  this ridiculousness.",

    "text": "I went with a personal friend on memorial weekend to observe the holiday and catchup. It was a great day and we were seated smoothly after a normal wait for the amount of clientele this Saturday. My friend whom is a geriatric decided she would best enjoy her meal outside and I can't explain enough how accomodating they were to my friend. I had the flight of mimosas and my buddy had breakfast and and a mimosa , as we converse about game of thrones and catch up as planned. Our waiter was a very well spoken and helpful man by the name of saichon I believe . However later we were greeted by what looked like the GM Dom . He greeted us cordial and asked  how everything was as is expected. After numerous compliments of the food , the service , accommodations and even the cleanliness my friend explained her distaste for one of the mimosas in 6 that we tried. His response was abhorrent to say the least., I'll check on that or , a quick response of a review  would have been sufficient , however Dom continued to drone on with long winded words closely related to the culinary field, criticized her palette , and explained decided it would be a good idea to remind my friend she asked for a special accommodation earlier. It was so rude,and shocking to my friend on this holiday . No words . I ended up paying for the whole meal to make up for his announcements to us in front of a busy restaurant. The place is great , get Dom off the floor back in the office ! Wish the Amex group had blog to post instead of just the business review forum .oh well",

    "text": "I am really middle of the road on this one. Plusses: 1) Concept is awesome. 2) Space is great! Lots of fun - great music. (Lots of old school hip hop, 90s stuff that I like.) I love the vibe. 3) I love a Bloody Mary bar! I love me some condiments in my Mary!  4) I love mimosas! I love that there are lots of flavors of mimosas. 5) I love brunch. There is an extensive brunch menu. I loved the Chicken Tinga Fritatta. It was flavorful, and delicious. Everything I want a brunch entree to be. I would definitely order it again.  Minuses: 1) Bloody Mary bar is expensive. $12 for one drink. I don't love Bloody Marys or condiments (even though they look awesome!) that much. A regular bloody is $9. Still.. I'm not there. Maybe if I decide that I am going to have the bloody as my lunch and load up on the condiments - then I can see where this makes sense. If I am going to eat - this is a little too much for me.  2) Mimosas - a flight of 4 is $16. Now, it may be one of those things where the glasses look smaller in a flight, or they might actually be. Either way - all mimosas are pre-mixed and have a ration of too much juice to champagne. All mimosas I have tried (although beautiful in presentation) are way too sweet and small for my liking. A regular mimosa is $6. See again - too sweet - and pre-mixed. 3) The New York scramble - flavorless - not worth it. The biscuit tastes like flour/baking soda. The potatoes are dry and really not great.   Overall - I will meet in the middle. I really like the concept, and I like the vibe - and one of 2 of the entrees I have had.  BTW - If you are looking for something like Hash House a Go Go - this is not it. A lot smaller entrees, less creative cuisine but has a Vegas-y vibe.",

I have been to a hash kitchen before my friends have not. Everything was very beautiful and inviting. Our server was very attentive and very nice. I think she was also the bartender. The manager on duty was always present I believe her name was Natalie. Because we are servers ourselves we always notice these things. I will be bringing more friends to this location. Maybe on a weekend where the DJ is playing. Thank you so much for being attentive and having great food we will be back",

They reached right into the jars of meats and cheeses with their dirty hands. Unacceptable.  Minus 1 star for the exessively loud music so loud you can't enjoy conversing with your dining party.  The food is very good but if you are going to get a bloody mary get it while you are waiting. I ordered mine after we sat down and the line was so long my food came before I got my drink.  Hash Kitchen definitely needs to address to efficiency of the Bloody Mary Bar. One bar tender taking the orders, payments and prepping the base drinks really backed up the line.  They also need to come up with a better method of keeping people from sticking their hands into the condiment jars.",

I also had to send the bacon back because when I asked for crispy, I didn't expect slightly cooked.The bacon was very, very salty as well.   In terms of my waiter I saw him not only welcome the couple that came and sat next to me, but also saw him explain the specials and the overall menu to them. All I got was \"are you ready to order?\". He was nice, but watching him greet them differently and explain all the menu had to offer was confusing.....kinda.   The place does have a cool vibe, with a bar and is relatively large so it can accommodate large parties. I went on a weekday, so there wasn't a wait at all and I was sat immediately.   In the process of posting this review, I received a prompt from Yelp saying that multiple positive reviews came from the same IP address, as if someone was trying to inflate the reviews here.  If someone did, I can see why because this place was truly a waste of calories...and time.",

    "text": "The dude and I love the Hash Kitchen up in North Scottsdale, so we were stoked about one opening up a little closer! Extra bonus points to them for hiring a local artist to paint the dope murals that line the interior. Unfortunately, that's pretty much the only part of the ambience that we were feeling. It was like... clubby? There was a DJ and it was super loud, we could barely even hear each other from across the table. It seemed way more fitting for like an old town brunch place, whereas Hash Kitchen (the other location, anyways) is classy and modern and clean.   We got to there around 9:30 on a Sunday, and there was no wait for 2 people. We were surprised, but definitely not gonna fight our luck. Our server was awesome: really friendly, quick, and helpful. We started with a flight of mimosas, which were tasty. The champs level was a little weak for most of them, except for the orange.   I had the herb chicken hash at the recommendation of our server, and the dude had the lump crab hash, which is probably his all time favorite breakfast dish at the OG HK. My dish was fine, every part of it was prepared well but it was lacking flavor. A little salt and pepper in fried chicken batter goes a long way, just saying. I'm glad I asked for sriracha because that was basically the only part of the dish that had any flavor. The dude felt pretty much the same way about his hash. He said there was barely any old bay in it, and everything was fine but not at all as mindblowing as the one at the other location. The biscuits that came with both of our hashes were very good.   I don't really know if HK just needs some time to figure out their vibe, but we were pretty disappointed by our experience here. Extra disappointed definitely when comparing it to the other location.",

It was awhile since I've been there but I ordered pancakes, I want to say it was Boston creme or something custard. ( I can't find it on their website) It was really good and a very large portion.   We came on a Saturday morning so it was really busy. The wait was about 30 minutes or so. I'm not sure if they do reservations, but if they do, you should definitely make one. I really wish that I could drink, because their drink menu looks amazing!They also have a dj there on Saturdays, which is good and bad. Good because they played really good music, bad because it was really loud, so I couldn't hear my friend that well.",

The place is decorated with hip breakfast/brunch words and hashtags all over as well. The place is nicely lite with natural light. The bar faces the patio that offers outdoor fireplaces too.  We ordered the classic French toast, the avocado toast and the tamales with eggs. Dear Lord! Portions are HHUUUGGGEEE! They offer a full bar as well. BONUS! Don't forget to get a \"selfie\" on the way out!  Food was well prepared, fresh and has excellent table presentation. Looking around I saw sandwiches that would feed 3 people they were so big. Our server Ashley was attentive, answered questions honestly, made awesome suggestions. She told us on weekend they have music and people dance!! DEFINITELY RETURNING.

The bartender serving us was super sweet! She had just moved to AZ from the Midwest I believe. My friend and I ordered a mimosa flight as well as some regular mimosas. If you're a Bloody Mary fan however then this is definitely the place for you! The Bloody Mary Bar is out of this world! So many toppings and spices to pick from. Now when ordering food be aware that the portions are pretty large, they can easily be split by 2 people. I recommend the skillets they are delicious!!!",

    "text": "The manager of Hash Kitchen Domenic has one of the most popular brunch places in Chandler that even the superficial people of Scottsdale drive their golden yachts down to check it out. I ordered the mimosa flight (super tasty) and one of the hashes that had carnitas (just as super tasty).     What I liked about Domenic the most is despite having a super popular venue (where he's making god knows how much) he knows it could just be a fad and is really hustling customer relations so you dont just visit once and never return. Also had some funny stories and a level of self awareness that I rarely see in managerial positions such as his.  I know you're reading this the day it gets posted Domenic but we were the group that talked about how they call it a \"drinking\" or \"water fountain\" not the term I now use which is \"bubbler\" .   If you ever want to run a comedy show at one of your businesses let me know. I can get you the best line-up in Arizona as I've got my ear to the ground in the scene. For anyone in Arizona (including Domenic) reading this please check out a free local comedy show I have a minor role in every Thursday @ Stand-Up Live 10:30PM called \"This Week Sucks Tonight!\"   It starts late because we have to wait for \"normal\" people, who don't understand comedy, to go to bed so they don't complain and cancel the show on Twitter. No drink minimum either! Come on down!   TLDR: Awesome venue, great management and I plugged a free weekly Thursday comedy show @ another venue because I wanted to get something out of this review as well .",

The patio was very nice with the misters and AC wind wall but that wind/ac mister blew too many napkins, straws, etc. to the ground. Someone needs to be picking up trash regularly.

We came out after hearing of the Bloody Mary bar that certainly exceeded expectations - it's a moderate price that includes all the yummy skewers and toppings that you get to add to your drink yourself! (: Although the place was crowded on a Saturday morning, we were able to hit the bar and enjoy the awesome DJ while we waited for our table and once seated the service was fast and friendly thanks to Dom and Nick! The food portions are large and filling but if you really want to over indulge, you have to go with the Mega Mimosa - topped with boba poppers and cotton candy! The menu is huge so there's definitely something for everyone's tastes, I'm sure we'll be back soon for more good times!",

The portion sizes are pretty large so if you aren't so hungry, I would suggest to split a meal.  Service was fast and friendly and the manager, Dominic stopped by to say 'hello'.  Overall, very good experience, just bring a dose of patience since it's usually pretty busy during brunch hours :)",

On our first trip, we did the s'mores French toast (heavenly and just as ridiculous as it sounds) and the steak breakfast burrito. Both were gigantic, so we ended up with an extra meal to take home! This time we shared the carnitas hash, and it was to die for. We nearly had to get a to-go box even after sharing it! The servers have all been super accommodating, especially today when we brought our dog to enjoy the patio! The manager, Dominic, checked in with us on both occasions and was a total gem. He is very appreciative of his patrons which makes us feel very special! Overall, this is a dynamite spot that was long overdue.",

Everyone knows (hash kitchen included) that brunch is really about the booze! Well, don't fret my fellow brunch babe, they have a walk up bar outside equipped with lounge chairs where you can get started on your Bloody Mary's and Mimosas while you wait. Don't forget to take that Bloody Mary inside to the garnish bar though. Rookie mistake! Aside from all that, the food and vibe is amazing! The bartender was killer and made sure we were taken care of even at our table. They also have gluten free options even for the pancakes. While you are there try their huevos rancheros hash. So yum!",

    "text": "This place isn't my cup of tea. I really like the passion fruit mimosa and the food is alright. I personally do not like the dj/loud music. It was SO loud today, I couldn't have proper conversations with the people I was with and we had to repeat ourselves to the server because she couldn't hear us either. The food came out quick but she took off right away and didnt ask if we needed anything else so we had to track her down to ask for hot sauce. My eggs in my Benedict were a little overdone and it was on the cool side, like it was sitting for a bit. I also had two random tiny pieces of pepper in my hash browns and one random little piece of onion? No one else at my table had those mixed in their hashbrowns and again there were only 3 tiny pieces of them so they obviously shouldn't have been there. When all was said and done and we were ready for the check the server just completely vanished and it took forever for her to come back and give us the bill. There were only 3 of us and the two tables around us were empty so I don't know what she was doing. I think I really only care for the mimosas at this place.",

After my wife met me we waited... waited... waited some more. Domenic the manager was quick to remedy the situation. He was very personable and apologized sincerely for our servers lack of attention. Now the food... I don't want to be that guy who takes pictures of food but we ordered the Pretzel Benedict and Asada Hash. Both were absolutely delicious. The Asada Hash (my meal) had the perfect amount of eggs, potatoes, meat, and corn bread. That cornbread itself is amazing. Despite our  rough start we know that we'll definitely be back for that build your own Bloody Mary bar... that in itself is impressive. Great food and look forward to returning sometime very soon.",

We waited 45 min which I'm always excited about cause it means something good is going on at the place for people to be waiting that long.   I had the Corned Beef Hash bene and my friend had the lump crab bene. The corned beef had literally no flavor (!!!), potato cakes were under-seasoned and the crab was fiiishhhyyyy. I found myself salting the entire dish twice over.  The bloody bar is great in theory but damn they need to get a grip on how to keep it sanitary. There's skewers to help and one pair of tongs for every 10 items but I almost starting grabbing things out of the jars out of frustration. Maybe have plates? Or different vessels for the toppings? Multiple tongs? One of the managers,Dominic, came by and made sure everything was great which it was at the time before I started to dive into my food. The service and the management are great which is the only reason why I gave the place two stars. Half way through the meal my friend and I sort of realized we were feeling the same way about the food. Dominic/other management and staff! You guys got a great idea goin on but the food needs to get a little more attention rather than the zany mimosas and bloodys toppings. I manage a restaurant about the same size as you and your service and floor work was attentive and personal and it made me want to like the food but I just couldn't.  The vibe and the restaurant is hype worthy but the execution of flavor in any of food was missed. Once you get your seasoning and flavors on point you got yourself an amazing brunch spot.",

Staff was very helpful and nice when suggesting what we should get. Our waiter Ryan was attentive and patient with us. When our food came out it was fresh, hot and so delicious. I had nothing but positivity when dining here. They even gave me a fresh cannoli donut for my birthday. Which was very fresh because it was still hot from the fryer!

We waited another 12 minutes for our drinks, and then had to ask for the garnish as described on the menu, he took our orders and it was 15 for our food. My scrambled eggs were runny. We were never checked on, dropped the check and said no hurry.  I would not come here again, first impressions mean a lot, and this place just doesn't deserve my hard earned money.

Coconut almond encrusted French toast? Dipped in vanilla cream?  My, my! Of course there are many yummy sounding lighter items to choose from. I had a delicious toasted kale and couscous salad, which was very light and refreshing. The dressing was tasty and subtly flavored. My friends had some of the delightful breakfast items, all of which could have been shared. Very generous portions.. Went with the girls for lunch so missed the build your own Bloody Mary bar, but we will be back! There were about six types of pickle available... and that's only the beginning. We were told of the DJ on the weekends, and that it can be a little loud. It was perfect on our weekday visit, not too loud at all. But we heard the weekends are very popular with the music , and that's wonderful. One of the managers, Dominic, greeted us warmly and entertained us with his great charm and wit. A new transplant from Cape Cod, welcome to Chandler, Dominic!  I get the sense that Hash is doing very well already, and I hope they stay for a long time to come. We enjoyed our lunch thoroughly, and will be back very soon. Ciao!",

It was nice for manager Dominic stopped by twice to see how our first experience was going. The server Ryan was very attentive to gluten free needs, but there is no gluten menu as mentioned in their regular menu. We'll be back to try other menu items.",

    "text": "Went there Friday to celebrate with friends. I was so excited to do the BYOBM BAR!  This was my first time there. Place is bigger than I expected and very loud. There is an actual dj playing songs. We ordered our brunch items along with mimosas and my byobm.  I was told I would get a ticket to visit the bar and that the bar tender would show me around the items that you add to your Bloody Mary.  I never received my ticket. The manager came over and visited with us, asking if he could check back mid-meal with us on how things were.  He visited with us for about 10 minutes.  In the meantime, my friends mimosas were sitting for quite a few minutes at the bar, waiting to be served at our table. Then, our good came out. I was immediately struck at how small the servings are. Wow!  For the price it should fill the plate. As for my byobm, still no ticket. My friend asked about the mimosas, still sitting at the bar.  The gal asked about my Bloody Mary/ticket...I told her that I never got it. So, the mimosas are delivered, our food is here, and I don't feel like spending 5-7 minutes building my Bloody Mary on the other side of the restaurant while my friends eat and my food sits back at the table getting cold. One waitress said 'Since you never got your ticket do you want just a regular Bloody Mary?  Sure.  It was okay. Just okay. A good management would have comped my Bloody Mary for the error that they made, but they didn't. I've never had sweet gherkin pickles in one before.  So, I left very disappointed.  Never did get to experience the very reason I went there. Will I go back?  Probably not.",

Surprisingly we only had to wait about 20 mins maybe because it was Sunday around one. There were four of us. The atmosphere was urban chic and industrial which looked really nice. The hostess was also very pleasant. The problem started once we were seated. We sat for over ten minutes without ANY acknowledgement from anyone. The place wasn't even at full capacity busy and all we were asking for was some simple eye contact and a \"be with you shortly but we see you\" kinda comment...we got NADA! We decided to try to give it another few minutes than once it encroached on sitting for 15 mins without even a glass of water...we decided enough was enough...why drop the cash here? As we got up to leave a server says \"I hope everything is ok?\" No, no it's not...I spoke to the hostess but it's not her fault at all. Anyways, I'm disappointed in this lackluster experience to say the least...since the menu did look eclectic and appealing but there's nothing like bad service to immediately ruin a place for us.",

I have had the same experience both during their opening week and about a week ago.  Once you have ordered and your food is ready, the person who serves it to you is not your server - it appears to be someone from the kitchen.  They have on both occasions failed to bring butter to accompany the biscuit.  When I have requested it, the person actually serving the food agrees to bring it out right away along with the hot sauce I requested at the same time.  Ten minutes later and there is neither butter nor hot sauce, so I have to flag down a manager, since I cannot find my server, and make the same request again.  That works well, but by now the food is growing cold.  They really need to raise their game on this score.",

They said i could sit outside if a server would be able to take me. They were short staffed, each server already had a lot on their plates. But one was willing to take me. So i got seated quickly. The selection is actually pretty good, some unique and standard stuff. Something for each type of diner it looks like. I got the carne asada breakfast burrito. Now i was thinking this thing would be small and over priced. The thing i liked was that i had my food out very quickly considering how busy it was. Even more so, this burrito was huge. Larger than standard breakfast burritos i normally get. It was not mostly tortilla either. It's was very flavorful, the pico was the right heat. I can't really handle spicy, but this had just the right touch of heat that gave me that kick but allowed me to enjoy my food. My server was very friendly and checked on me in a timely manner, which was nice since she was so busy. The manager even took the time to check on me. It was a bit pricey, which would be a my only issue. 21 bucks for my whole bill, including the 5 dollar tip. I only got the burrito and water. I'll go back, the atmosphere is great for a Sunday morning to set a good mood for the day. If your on a budget, plan for 15 to 20 a person with meal,  basic drink and tip.",

    "text": "My husband and I went in for brunch on a Thursday morning. It was relatively busy for a weekday morning, but we only waited about five minutes to be sat. When the hostess seated us we asked if we could move to a larger, more comfortable table and the host told us we could not because she needed to save those tables for parties of three or more. There were several larger tables available, but we did not argue. Less then five minutes later, we watched her seat a group of two at a four top directly next to us. After ordering our food, we sat and waited. 30 minutes later, we noticed the table behind us, who sat right as we were ordering, got their food, which consisted of a well done hamburger as well as several other dishes. We had asked our server a few times where our food was, and he brushed us off saying it would be right out. When our food finally arrived at our table, it was not correct. At this point my husband approached the manager and he told us that he would take care of the dish for us. A few minutes later, a different manager came out with my Avocado toast. After finally getting my food, I tasted it and was not a huge fan. The pork was sweet which i did not love and my husbands food was cold at this point because he was waiting to eat with me. We did not see our server for the rest of our meal, except for when he came out to drop off our check. We were surprised to see that the avocado toast had not been taken care of, like the manager said he would do. At this point one manager came to clear my plate, which was still full of food, and asked if I did not like it. I told him it was just okay. Instead of just taking care of this, he went to the back and sent a different manager out. We had already paid our tab, and just wanted to leave because we had already had such a terrible experience. My husband and myself have both worked as managers in the food service industry for several years, and always try to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt, but this was all around a horrible dining experience. I would give zero stars if I could.",

If Bloody Mary's are not your thing they also have a bunch of different fruity mimosas that are really good. I had the avocado toast that was HUGE and YUMMY! I had enough leftovers for the rest of my family to enjoy when I got home. All of the portions are very generous and so many great things on the menu it was hard to decide what to get. All Of the staff and management was very accommodating even with our large group. I will be good by back very soon!",

I mention the millennial part because we,  being baby boomers, were immediately caught up in the positive atmospheric vibe and the promise of delicIous food and AMAZING mimosas and of course the Bloody Mary bar.  Domenic, the manager and the wait staff were attentive. Domenic checked on us no less than 3 times. We did  have a slight spillage mishap; however, the staff took care of it quickly and topped off our drinks. We're definitely making our way back.",

Friendly, interested in keeping his patrons happy, and he is constantly circulating checking on each table.  The wait staff is friendly and extremely attentive but not intrusive.

There were people outside and the parking lot was full with people walking to this restaurant from Whole foods parking lot, so I hoped that this was going to be a treat for us.  We love breakfast and brunch! Nothing starts your day off when your first meal is delicious.  We were not disappointed.  I was greeted right away and surprised that I was seated right away even though my husband was parking our car.  Gabriel our waiter was at our table with in minutes and answering questions and explaining the menu to us since this was our first time.  Let's talk about Gabriel for a second.  It is very nice and very unusual to find a waiter in AZ who is service oriented. Gabriel is just that, during our meal I watched him help other customers with the same kind words and actions.  Usually waiters will plop down a menu and come back in less than 5 minutes to get your order so that they can rush customers out fast to make bigger tips.  Okay I know that the fast music is make you eat faster to get more customers in, but we never felt rushed.  Thank you Gabriel, for making our first time at  Hash kitchen an enjoyable one.  The food was delicious.  Hash Kitchen serves huge portions with a very creative menu.  I am an egg's benedict snob.  The hollandaise sauce was perfect, and the eggs were cooked to perfection.  I was also very impressed how the whole staff worked as a team.  Everyone removed dishes not just the wait staff but the managers too.  Will we come back let's see? Friendly hard working staff, wonderful atmosphere, fabulous food, Mimosa which are yummy, and make your own Bloody Mary Bar.   YOU BET!!",

It was decent, but the cheese sauce overwhelmed the entire thing. It was also hard to cut. I think a Pretzel Bagel may be a better choice, but it wouldn't look as cool. If I ever got this again, I would ask for the cheese sauce on the side. My friend had a lovely frittata. It was good but not seasoned a lot. The side hash potatoes were nothing special. Still... we would definitely go back to try other items. Even their pancakes looked amazing. Presentation of everything was on point.  The atmosphere is hip and fun, but it is LOUD. We only waited about 5 minutes but it was for lunch on a Thursday.  Service - our guy was meh. He didn't offer hot sauce or ketchup for the hashbrowns, we had to flag him down for refills, and he just seemed like he could not wait to escape.",

Their Bloody Mary bar has everything you would want to have! Gave it 4 stars because the outdoor patio every time I have been has always seemed to be in need of a good cleaning. A morning spray down of the patio and patio seats would go a long way. Dried bird poop on some of the cushions isn't the most appealing. It's outside, I get it however, as I said a morning power wash of the patio would go a very long way to make for a more pleasant dining experience. Staff is nice but sometimes there's a wait to be seated even thou there isn't a line because no one is manning the front. Other than those small things, I love coming here. The food is great.

Some observations...  - Running a corned beef through a buffalo chopper (suspect that's how they prepared it) does not make it hash. - Putting the aforementioned chopped corned beef over potatoes does not make it hash. - Notwithstanding the above the corned beef was good, but it wasn't hash. - Two eggs we cook properly and were placed over the corned beef. - Biscuits were extremely meh.  Far too dense and frankly were closer to being dumplings (albeit not boiled) than a biscuit. - Gravy was ok.  Oddly enough it came out boiling (it is served in a heated skillet).  The boiling gravy continuedd to cook the over easy eggs until they were over hard...not cool (how do they not know that?).   - The sausage in the gravy uses an Italian sausage that's better suited to being in spaghetti sauce for dinner than gravy for breakfast.  - They have a bloody mary bar...if that's your thing.  Good news, we were able to be seated right away.  I suspect that's not the case on the weekend.  Pretty sure I wouldn't be willing to wait.",

    "text": "I'll be honest, i went in here expecting not to like it.  I mean, read the reviews.  You'd think it was like eating an omelet at a Las Vegas pool party.  I'm glad the actual experience was nothing like that.    Is there a DJ with your breakfast?  Yes, but DJ Pancakes (our given name for him, not his stage name...probably) wasn't annoying, wasn't overly loud, and, mercifully, he wasn't playing EDM.  It was the equivalent of having a top-40 station playing a bit loudly.    The Bloody Mary bar is fun.  It's $12 and you could literally eat that for your meal.  There are dozens of toppings including the basics (olives, pickles, bacon, cheese) and the absurd (chicken wings, meatballs, kimchi). The nice part here is if you're waiting for your table you can step right up and start with a bloody, no wait required.   Speaking of bars, the bar is first come first served.  You can skip the long wait if you see spots open.  The service there was great.    The food was very good.  I went with the Italian Hash which had ample amounts of sausage, delicious potatoes (not greasy at all), and two perfectly poached eggs.  Other items we saw come out looked great too.    There are definitely some eye catching choices.  The giant full bottle mimosas are a sight to be seen and the cereal shooters seemed to be a hit.  I'll stick with a Bloody and a hash next time, though.    The prices are a bit high but so was the quality.  Besides, DJ Pancakes has to put Lil' Syrup through college and we all need to do our part to make sure that happens.",

Too bad I don't like bloody Mary's.  They have a make your own bar, I seen a few people really getting down on the toppings!

Someone was mowing weeds outside and leaves and dirt blew into our drinks and food. The server said she'd remedy the issue but only returned with our bill.   We didn't have much time left, due to the terrible service that day so we paid and left. I'm hoping this is just an off past couple of experiences.

The french toast that I had was ridiculously thick - to the point where it wasn't cooked consistently. The inside was soggy and the outside was very crisp. That was disappointing. The bacon was very good but needed to be better drained. The burrito that the hubby had was tasty and my son's egg scramble was disappointing.

The reviews make the Hash kitchen sound like a world renown restaurant run by one of those famous TV chefs. However, I hate to admit it the food fell short on expectations.   I had the HK Hash Fried Chicken, potatoes  and eggs. My husband had the scramble with bacon, eggs, onions and peppers with a side of potatoes.   I loved the chicken! It was cooked perfectly and so flavorful. The potatoes were dry and the eggs were O.K.                             My husband's scramble had lots of cheese and looked yummy. However, he said it lacked flavor and he felt the portion was small for the price. He gave it a 3 out of 5 stars.                               We both had the Craft Mimosas with orange juice. I didn't taste very much champagne. Although, I hear the other options and the bloody Mary's are better.             Service: We were greeted immediately upon entering and seated immediately. I hear that this rare. Our waiter brought us water promptly. Our food and mimosas were delivered pretty fast also. The one downside was that the waiter brought my husband the wrong food and he had to wait a little longer to get the correct order. The waiter wasn't very attentive after bringing us our food and drinks. He did not come around to refill our water or see if we wanted another drink.   Overall, it was OK. I'd try it again but a different dish and drink. The DJ wasn't here today as well. That would have made the atmosphere more exciting.",

I will say that the mimosa flight I had was delicious (though it was supposed to come with the pineapple flavored one and didn't, which is fine, but I was told this as it was put down in front of me instead of ahead of time). However the menu is one of those menus where the breakfast place is trying to \"do up\" classics. That usually translates into a huge mess that's almost impossible to eat. I ordered the egg McMuffin hash style. It indicated that it had a giant English muffin (I even questioned how large and she showed me with her hand). What she didn't mention is that it is not an English muffin at all, but a huge crunchy roll that is impossible to bite into. I wish I had taken a picture of what it looked like when it arrived.  It was so tall there was no way I could get my mouth around it. Even when I smashed it down it still was too big. So then I tried to cut the thing, however they give it to you on a tiny little board and all I managed to do was mush the entire thing all around. It was in my lap, it was on the table, it was ridiculous. I asked for a plate, but by then it was just too late. I've included a picture so you can see what I was talking about. I really wish breakfast places wouldn't try to doll up classics and would just do them classic. Maybe if I had ordered something else I would've enjoyed this place better, not sure I'm willing to give it another try to find out though when there are so many other places around that I love, like BLD, Biscuits, Gilbert House, and The Farmhouse.",

The chilaquiles was comprised of chips, topped with a salsa verde that wasn't even \"simmered\" and an egg on top. She asked for no chicken because she can't eat chicken. They forgot to add the cotija and sour cream. It was basically a $14 chips with salsa.   The Banana split was advertised like this: caramelized bananas / sweet mascarpone / seasonal berries / warm salted caramel drizzle / walnuts   The bread was dry and they put literally 2 small slices of bananas, 2 blueberries, 2 slices of strawberry and they forgot the walnuts.   Basically, I'm giving 2 stars for the drinks and not the food. I would suggest eating somewhere else first then grabbing drinks here with friends because they had a fun atmosphere and a DJ playing a good set.   I wish I liked it more so I could eat and drink all in one place.  We were going to bring these issues up in person but we never got a chance because the server was running around and didnt ask us how everything was.",

    "text": "I was very excited to see Hash Kitchen open up a location in Chandler! I've personally gone there almost a handful of times now. The wait is usually lengthy (45 minutes to 1 hour) especially on Saturday & Sunday mornings but they do have a set up to grab a fun drink & wait outside. Now that it has cooled down, the patio would be a good choice to enjoy brunch.  After trying several of their menu items, I've been a fan of the sweeter items. My favorites have been the Coconut / Almond Encrusted French Toast & Fruity Pebble Pancakes. The hashes are good too and they have similar options in form of Benedicts & Frittatas.  The service has usually been good but don't be surprised if it's a time consuming experience. The food is good though, so it's usually worth the wait. It is nice that they have a DJ who plays music but it does get loud .. again, the patio may be a better option for to avoid that!",

Weekends can be really busy so we decided a weekday stop would give us a chance to let the food and the place sink in. Everything about the appearance gets 5 Star from me. It looks like a Magazine staged restaurant showcase/showroom floor. The Bloody Mary bar, boom.... staff (Dominic the manager & our server) ... on point. So what could go wrong right your asking???   Nothing on the menu jumped out to our likings (took us forever to decide) so I hit Yelp and looked at pictures. We decided on the Avocado Toast, kids chocolate chip pancakes & the flat iron Steak & eggs. When the food came I was surprised that my steak was so small. Eggs were hot, but the steak was well done (ask for it medium) and the hash-browns were like baby ice cubes... cold. No issues when I told the staff but it should of never came out to the table that way. Kids pancakes were the same way, just lukewarm. Got the new steak and realized it's just s tough piece of meat and not good. The sauce with the steak wasn't that good either. I ate the avocado toast (way to many leeks) but it was bland. I've had so much better.   The presentations have people at nearby tables complimenting left & right... but I think they were lit from the drinks. This will sound weird, but I think the presentations & stellar menu of drinks make everyone down play the flavors of the food. (Not just my observation)  I plan to come back as everything from the vibe to the drinks are enticing, but with the hopes of changing my 1st experience.",

    "text": "Overall great experience.   The wait is about 30 to 45 minutes if you go there on a Saturday or Sunday. It be awesome if they had a digital no waitlist through Yelp. I would save so much time and also help with organization and the chaos of people waiting outside of their doors.   The staff was so friendly. The managers go around and say hi to every single person that walks in and every table.  The bar is always packed.  There is a separate bloody Mary bar at the front entrance right by the waiting area/ host stand.  ** WARNING: bloody Mary bar is overpriced and so expensive. Our group ended up getting one really tall glass (32 OZ cost $30!) and two normal glasses ($15 each) cost us $75!   The bartenders will try to upgrade you and get you to spend a little more by asking you if you want it's a double or if you want extra stuff on it and I would just recommend just ordering from your table instead of ordering from the bloody Mary bar because the prices are not listed and then you end up spending a lot more than you need to for a couple of drinks.   I am just being honest...  Food overall is great. The donuts are absolutely my favorite because they're deep-fried have so much texture and there's a cheesecake type of frosting in the center of the donut plus a donut hole place on top which is just so beautiful, and taste sooooo good!  The only reason I'm giving them a four out of five is honestly because of the wait time I just don't think it makes any sense at all to have something so well-known be so on organized when it comes up to waiting to get seated. Just makes sense to do reservations or Yelp \"no wait\".",

The place is loud because of the live DJ but not so loud that you can't still have conversation at the table.  Most of us had coffee so our waitress left us a carafe which was refilled throughout our meal.  Staff is friendly, manager Dominick came by our table to chat and later checked on us after our meals were delivered which was a nice touch.  We ordered the donuts to share, they are amazing and could only be better with perhaps a powder sugar dusting.  The menu choices are widespread so there is something for every craving.  The best was the avocado toast, so many flavors mixed into one bite full.  If you're looking for quiet and greasy comfort food this is not your spot.  But, if you want a lively upbeat place with some spunk in their menu choices then definitely check out Hash.",

The menu selection is extensive and as we watched other people's food come out at nearby tables I don't think there was a single plate I wouldn't have been happy to try. I ended up getting the pretzel Benedict - unique and very tasty! One of the people in our party wasn't completely satisfied with his meal and when Dominic the manager came by and learned of this he was so nice and immediately offered to get him something else, no questions asked. My only slightly negative thing would be that the music was pretty loud and it was hard to have a conversation with the people you're with.  My recommendation would be to come early as this place is packed!!  Dominic and Ryan we're absolutely fantastic and really made our breakfast enjoyable. We will definitely be back!!",

Our server accidentally mixed up our bill and we notified the staff. She seemed like she got in big trouble. We saw her very upset later on at Whole Foods! She said she got fired on the spot for that simple mistake! We were shocked and we felt so bad!! Very poor management, and it seems like they don't treat their staff very fairly. We loved this place too! Poor girl was traumatized and we feel guilty for it! We won't be back unfortunately.",

    "text": "9/30/18 Yelp Review Chandler, AZ Hash Kitchen 2855 w Ray Road Unit 3 85249          I heard about Hash Kitchen through several friends, but never went because I thought it was only an over 21 place with unique bloody Mary's and mimosa's. I did some more research on the menu and found that they had way more than their famous bloody Mary bar. They had very unique food combinations that sounded very appealing to me and my girlfriend. Once I looked over the menu and saw food options like cannoli pancakes, s'mores French toast, and chicken fried steak served on a waffle, I knew I had to go there.   When we arrived at the restaurant at about 10:15 am on a Sunday the wait was about 30-45 minutes. They had a little outside waiting area with chairs and a bar where you can order alcoholic drinks or coffee which made the wait feel like 15 minutes. We ordered a hazelnut cappuccino which was prepared perfectly. The cappuccino was $3.75 which is a very normal price for that drink. The only thing better than the cappuccino was the service by the young male bartender with about shoulder length hair. Not only did he take his time explaining the ladies bloody Mary in front of me. He made sure she absolutely loved it. He not only was doing a great job but was having fun at the same time. He made sure we got our drink and made the experience way more enjoyable than a normal breakfast spot.   The wait was finally over and we were seated at our table. It was very loud inside because they had a DJ playing the whole time. I liked it because it was a unique experience for a breakfast spot. Our server was great and our food was out very quickly. It took us a while to order because of all the options. We wanted everything on the menu. We ended up deciding on Cannoli donuts as a starter, coconut almond encrusted French toast, and the carnitas hash.   The cannoli donuts came out about 5 minutes after we ordered. They were served to us by the same bartender that served us before we were seated. He served us the food with the same incredible customer service he had before. The donuts were incredible. They were so warm and soft so you can tell they just made them. The hole in the middle of the donut was filled with the sweetened ricotta cheese and they were sprinkled with powder sugar. I loved the taste and ate two of them which made me feel almost full before the main dishes came out.   Approximately 10 minutes later the French toast and carnitas hash came out. We started on the carnitas hash and it was scrumptious. The carnitas was sweet and savory, while the potatoes were perfectly cooked, and the toppings perfectly complimented the Mexican carnita meat. Now it was time for the coconut almond encrusted French toast. By this time, we were both very full and tired, however we knew we had to finish or at least try to eat the French toast. We had some and it was delectable. The warm thick brioche bread, with burnt coconut shavings on top, the glazed banana slices, and the sweet syrup made it irresistible. Overall the atmosphere is a more young or upbeat setting, the service was top notch, and the food was magnificent. The only tiny downside is the price was a little higher for breakfast. The cappuccino was $3.75, donuts $12, Carnitas hash $16, and French toast $13. The total was about $55 with tax and tip. Although it was a little pricier than the average breakfast place, the quantities were well worth the price. Hash Kitchen was an incredible experience that will have you taking a nap after eating yourself into a food coma. I will definitely  recommend this place to anyone.",

We ordered the cannoli pancakes and corned beef hash plates. Delicious!! We had a 40 minute wait when we got there, so we got ourselves a Bloody Mary, highly recommend doing that if you have a long wait.

Our waters were never refilled, our server took our drink order one at a time leaving each time someone ordered a mimosa before we could say \"wait\" she was certainly not interested in serving us. Along with that mess our drinks took forever. When our food was dropped our server was no where to be found to ask how everything was. Our table was never offered second drinks as well. We all tipped 20% or more because we are servers but get it together guys.",

Manager was very rude and said keeping the garage door open to sell drinks at the bar was more important than everyone's comfort and safety inside. We were told it \"wasn't worth it\" to shut the garage.  Women's bathroom stall also did not have a door on it. Very negative experience.",

Not just loud, but ear bleeding, teenagers bedroom when the parents are out of town, you'll be deaf by the time you are 30 loud. We read the reviews, but thought maybe it was a few people who didn't like the music system - nope. It's so loud you literally can't talk. The wait staff can't take your order.  There was a child on a table near us who had her ears covered and was c.r.y.i.n.g !  We should be able to work out how loud because they had a decimal counter out and were monitoring how loud it is.  Here is a top tip for the management - if you have to measure to see if it's too loud -it's too loud !!!  The ladies who was taking the measurements mouthed \"it's too loud\" - so we were hopeful that it might get turned down.  Nope, it got a fraction quieter and then went up to blast levels again once she left.  There was a line to get in, and I can't blame people for loving the food, but next time we will order delivery.  Take your ear defenders - I wish I was joking.",

I had ordered the avocado toast(Pictured) in the past, but decided it was stop much for me(not a bad thing), just wasn't as hungry. This time I ordered the beyond burger with a friend egg, so delicious! I am eager to go back and will be visiting and bringing everyone I know. I'm sure this will be our new family go-to. The added touch is the DJ booth that plays good music while you're eating. I do not have any complaints about my visits to Hash Kitchen, other than I wish they were open later, lol. See you soon!!!",

We sat in a small two top against a wall. Anyhow, she was amazing. Super kind, nailed our detailed order from memory. Follow up timing was perfect. The food arrived in such a short time. Food quality was VERY good. The menu selection was so hard to choose from as so many options sounded so good. The servers suggestion to try the cannoli pancakes as a shared side was SO good.   Eventually we met the manager Dominic. We appreciated his checking in on us and giving a brief overview of other locations to come. I'm looking forward to their Italian theme coming to chandler mall area.   Great visit. I'll be back to experience the DJ too.",

From the moment we arrived everything was fantastic.  Our large table in the back was ready and the speakers even turned off so we could converse easier, without yelling.   The decor is quite cute- mostly white, offset with green \"planty\" things covering some if the walls.   Our waitress was friendly and patient with us, having to come back several times to take our order because we were so indecisive since everything looked amazing on the menu.   I believe we all had different dishes-from as simple oatmeal to as traditional as omelets to smoked salmon sliders. Everyone quite enjoyed their food.   There was an amazing Bloody Mary bar with at least 30 choices to add. The price was a reasonable $13! Only one of our group got one but it was amazing to watch her build it.   There was a DJ playing great music and it wasnt intrusive to the ears at any point- not only because the speaker was off at our table but even next to him at the Bloody Mary bar, the volume was quite comfortable.   Dont miss the selfie and picture \"booth\" next to the Bloody Mary bar. A few of us took pics and had them sent straight to our phones.   Finally, and perhaps the highlight of our visit, was when Dominic, the manager, stopped by to chat with us. He seemed to be a great guy, albeit, with terrible taste in football teams (the Pats! Hahaha). He was very animated and fun and was like the cherry on top of the sundae for our visit.   I highly recommend this place. Privately owned and not some big chain place. Give it a shot- you will not be disappointed!",

Although I've been here about an hour before and the DJ stopped playing right when we got in. Like why couldn't he play the whole time?  Anyways, definitely would recommend. Sunday's are the worst days to go after 11am. The wait is about an hour.",

Yes, It is a club like atmosphere, intentionally Yes, It is loud and crowded Yes, there is a long wait Yes, it is brunch  Yes, you can enjoy a quiet breakfast before 9am.  Can we not bash businesses because they have a different concept of a brunch experience???  Ok, now to the review....  I was Impressed by the customer service from start o finish. Our server, Jesus, was attentive throughout the entire dining experience He asked if it was our 1st time and we said yes. He then asked if we would like recommendations and again we said yes. He explained the concept and the bloody mary bar  The food was good. I ordered the huevos Rancheros and my wife had a custom scramble. Psst, the biscuits are yummy.  The bloody mary bar is fun. You get to choose your own options   The manager, Dominic came by and checked on us to make sure everything went well. That was nice.  Overall, this was a good experience with lots of options.  If you have a young family or dont like the loud environment, come before 9am. The DJ starts at 9am and I gets pretty vibrant.  We will definitely be returning",

They had a DJ playing great music that made me want to dance the entire time! There is even a waiting area around the corner where you could order a drink and hang out until your table is ready. Shortly after being seated we were approached by Dominic, one of the managers, and he was so genuine! It's not everyday you encounter people who truly care about your experience. This will definitely be my go to brunch spot from now on!",

I deal with customer service a lot and it was a situation that could have been handled differently and I'm glad to say that Chris took my experience very seriously. I'm happy we spoke about it and better explained the companies policy.   Overall.  I'm excited to go back, the food portions are NO JOKE. If you order the avocado toast hash style is amazing, huge.  Definitely share! Everything my girlfriends and I had was very shareable, so if there is anything I could recommend is don't order the same thing.

Domenic, one of the managers, is a dynamic presence in the restaurant and greeted every table with sincere interest in our experience. The restaurant was packed with a lively crowd and everything that came out looked like a piece of art. Hard to do with breakfast. If you're looking for a fun atmosphere, unbelievably huge and artistic dishes, and the most amazing Bloody Mary (like a salad bar buffet), this is the place to go. Thanks again for the super warm and personal experience, Domenic. You guys rock. I beg you, come to Tucson.",

    "text": "Had the best experience at Hash Kitchen on Monday morning. We were sat right away in Jessica's section where she was very attentive. My friend chose to get a coffee cocktail and was just a tad disappointed there were not any options for HOT coffee cocktails only iced. I went with the Bloody Mary bar where there were too many options for my own good. We shared the Huevos Ranchero Hash which was amazing and more than enough food for us. It also came out pretty quick! Homemade biscuits were delicious!! We later had a friend join and we ordered the XXL Strawberry mimosa which was AMAZING. It has little strawberry poppers at the bottom which was fun. Dominic stopped by our table a couple of times and was very communicative. Nonetheless our experience was phenomenal and everyone at Hash kitchen did amazing!",

We were shocked at the prices but when the food arrived felt better spending the money because of the portion size and food quality.  Neither one of us could finish our food so we both have dinner for tonight.  I cannot wait to bring my husband back and try out the OMG Bloody Mary bar and the Mimosa flight.  Only suggestion is to have half portions available.  Waitresses were very nice and place was very clean and friendly environment.  Can't wait to go back!",

Their Bloody Mary Bar is to die for and their dishes are just as good too. Such a fun atmosphere!",

I am not an experienced juggler so it forces you to drink fast to clear space. I suppose have a DD or eat slow if you sit at a little table and have more than drinks. Go before 9am on a weekend or prepare to wait an hour but even if you wait it will be worth it. Not a quiet place so make sure you were not looking for cozy and quaint. Fun and open? Yes!! Mimosa flight was delish, my favorite was the kiwi-$16. Bloody Mary bar? Hell yes! Who doesn't want a spicy bloody with jalapeno poppers, bacon, cheese, meatballs, and slim Jim's- $15? Lemon ricotta pancake was amazing not overly sweet and super light- no syrup required. The chicken tinga frittata was massive and could have fed 2. Super fresh flavors. The savory chicken and waffle was also a huge plate of food. Meals average 12-15 per plate and you can get 1/2 orders of pancakes etc. 1/2 of the LR pancakes was 2 huge ones which would have been a meal.  Staff were friendly, full bar opens to the patio, took a few for a server to show up. Patio is shaded by massive umbrellas and is dog friendly, bringing my pup next time.",

We arrived and we were told it would be about 15-20 minutes for a table. We were waiting for a table on the patio. After about a half hour I went in to check on our table because there were several available and had been since we arrived. The blonde, stalky, manager/hostess said it was because the kitchen was bombarded. I completely understand that. She said they would rather us wait a little longer than wait for our food. I said I would think they would just communicate that to us and maybe let us sit and have drinks. (I would assume they would like the revenue from the bar while we waited.) I went back outside and our alert went off. Now, here's where the low star review comes in. The blonde lady sat us at a table on purpose against a pillar. My husband asked if we could sit at the one next to it and she said no, somebody was sitting there. Lol. Nobody sat there. There were 15 empty tables on the patio. We were VERY WELL AWARE this was her way of \"putting me in my place\" for voicing my concern. We literally had to move the table at an angle to be able to sit at it. I'm sure she was giggling. It's OK. We won't be back because of her and this \"customer service.\"",

The food was just \"ok\" and maybe I would be more forgiving of that if the service was good. It was a MONDAY at 11am (not even a weekend or holiday).  First issue: I called the place twice and was told they don't do reservations. I was not at the place when the group first got there, as I was bringing the birthday girl, but my friends told me that our waitress had a slight attitude about having to serve/seat 8 people. When I did get to the place, the waitress was ok, but I and the rest of my table could tell she did not care to work with us.   Secondly, my favorite part was when I asked our waitress if we could take a quick picture below a cute sign. The table in front of it was still dirty and I did not want to take someone else's table. She agreed and as we got up to head over, the lady who was I guess the hostess for the morning, let out an audible sigh and very clearly rolled her eyes (Not discreet at all) as if we just ruined her whole day or took the table (no one sat at that table for quite a while, so I know she was just having an incredibly rude attitude and wanted us to see it.)   Get better employees.  Like I said, the food was just \"ok\" for all the hype, but I think the staff attitude also put a bad taste in our mouths.",

After observing how the restaurant was managed we noticed the staff and bus boys were very slow.    That is probably because it is so hot.   I haven't tried the food, but would still never come.    PS.  The music is so loud we couldn't hear each other.  The whole staff seems to be in utter chaos, overall if you don't have a whole day  to eat breakfast this is not the place to eat at, awful experience.   BTW it is taking over 20 min to get my bloody Mary.",

Our waitress was fantastic! Super friendly and very attentive.  Let me tell you about their Blood Mary bar. What an amazing concept!!! So many options. As much as you can cram on as many skewers you'd like and fit into your drink. Tons of pickled items and even hot items like meatballs, cheese ravioli and hot bacon. I created a master piece!!! Check out my photo. They offer 6 different infused vodkas but unfortunately did not offer plain vodka which I would have preferred.   The menu offers phenomenal options for breakfast and lunch. We decided to try the pretzel Benedict and the breakfast sandwich sliders with fried. The pretzel Benedict with poached eggs, bacon, and beer cheese sauce was the BOMB!!! The sliders had crispy bacon, onion jam, fried egg and ham on a delicious bun. We shared both meals and still had one slider left.   I definitely recommend this place!!! You will have a fantastic experience.",

Parts of it were not so good (the seating arrangements.) Overall, I would go back, but I am not in a huge rush to do so.  First of all, this place is BUSY. Of course, we went on a Sunday morning, so that is on us, but wow - packed. We were seated immediately, but we got one of the last open tables and this place is not small. By 9am the line was out the door and around the corner. So, being that it was so packed we felt a little cramped. We were at a small table smooshed in between other tables and it was hard to even get out of my seat without bumping the tables next to me. I do not like splurging on brunch and being so cramped that I cannot enjoy it. So, not a fan of the seating.  The food that we ordered was really good. Husband had to have breakfast poutines as an appetizer (I mean who orders an appetizer at brunch???), but they were out of this world delicious. I really liked them a lot. Who knew that fried leek straws were so tasty?  For meals I had the pineapple pancakes which were fine, but nothing terribly special. Think regular pancakes with candied pineapple rings in between them. And he ordered the carne asada breakfast burrito which he really enjoyed.  I ordered a peach mimosa which tasted like a regular mimosa, which was fine, but nothing special.They also have a ridiculous bloody mary bar if you are talented enough to craft one of these. I am not, and I much prefer a bar tender to do it for me because mine never taste right, but there were a lot of people having fun doing this if that is your thing. There was even a guy hanging out behind the bar (I am assuming to help people like me) so maybe you will have better luck than I usually do.  So, hipster food, really busy and getting to know the table next to you was our overall first time experience. Which is fine, but nothing that I am going to rush right out and do again.",

My wife said the french toast was the worst she has ever had and my daughter refused to eat the scrambled eggs which is usually her favorite breakfast food.   Combine this with the weird attempts to be \"hip and cool\" like a dj playing music for breakfast, an unnecessarily complicated bloody mary bar and high prices, you get a place that focuses on flash and frills before getting the food right.   I really wish we had liked the food because I would have liked to come back and seen Dominic again.",

It was just the two of us but asked for a four-top as we tend to order a lot and we was happily accommodated. And we did use a lot of table.  Got my friend the Cereal drinks flight. That was a lot of fun, I tried a little bit of each and dang those are strong.  I got the Torta with carne asada and it was very good, although next time I'll skip on the grilled green onions, I couldn't bite them and they just slid out, gross. But they do put friend onion strings on it and those are wonderful.  I also ordered a pancake for the table, I like a little sweet with my salty food. It was decent, not dissatisfied.  My friend ordered something with salmon, she's a salmon fiend. She ordered the frittata I think but didn't discover they had a salmon board until it was too late. So she said we are definitely going back.  I will be back. Probably not on a weekend still, but that's okay, as long as business is good for them.",

    "text": "Hash Kitchen is an indulgent, boisterous, trendy, sensory overload, party.   We ended up sitting outside because it was the first available spot after an insanely long wait (over an hour for brunch)! Our waitress was personable and attentive. She said weekends are cray-cray but if you visit Monday-Thursday you have much different experience and easier time getting into the restaurant.   The menu is pretty much a carb/sugar bomb and the drinks are the same. But the offerings are certainly instagramable with with fancy presentations that feature drinks in disco ball mugs top with cotton candy, colorful fruity pebbles pancakes, and crunchy fried leeks adorning breakfast skillets. Eat here and your insta-story will be strong.   WE DRANK:   Bloody Mary - undrinkable due to it being far too salty. I sent it back which I never do! I will note that my friend's bloody mary was good so not sure where the overly saltiness came from in my drink.  Matcha Latte - the replacement drink was made so strong that it has no discernible flavor other than straight alcohol.   WE ATE:  Cannoli Donuts - were too dense for my liking with not enough filling to balance out.  Herb Fried Chicken - The chicken was moist and not dry so that was a win. However, salt again dominated the dish and that seems lazy to rely so heavily on salt alone when there are so many other seasoning out there to use for flavor.    I'm all for being inventive and having fun with food but the taste needs to be there too. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by pretty much everything I ordered, add to that the long wait-time and I haven't been back to Hash Kitchen since this poor visit.",

    "text": "At the recommendation of my son to stop by the Hash Kitchen for a late breakfast. All I can say is, WOW! This is place is the place to be for breakfast and brunch. Located on Ray just east of the 101 freeway in Chandler the spacious restaurant offers a menu that will satisfy everyone.  My wife ordered the chicken and waffles and let me tell you this is definitely a go-to dish if you want chicken that is full of flavor topped with leeks. The waffles are very tasty and compliments the dish to perfection. My son ordered the French toast and he said it made his top 5 list of the best French toast he has ever had. I ordered the veggie scrambler, this dish was loaded with veggies from sun dried tomatoes to asparagus mixed in with egg whites. The pancakes were awesome and is a must have.  Pack some patience if you are planning on going mid-morning, wait times can be up to 1hr. We went around 2pm and we were able be seated right away....this place is well worth the wait.  The service was magnificent, Kendra waited on us and she was awesome, attentive, friendly, and made our visit worth going back. Dominic one of the managers stopped by to give some background on the restaurant and to share some long-term vision for expansion.   We circled back the next day after church for a pick up order and dayum!!!  YES MISTER!!!!!",

They try to seat you as fast they can but with people taking full advantage of the Bloody Mary bar, getting a table can take you awhile. They also don't take reservations unless you come with a large party.   Not sure about during the week, but the weekends they have a DJ so the music is good. It's pretty loud in there so if you bring little ones, bring some headphones for them. I loved the Build your own Bloody Mary bar. Lots of toppings available to fit everyone's tastebuds. My friends and I ordered the avocado toast, breakfast burrito and banana split French toast. Food portions are huge so you can easily share a dish or not :) I'll definitely be back to try some more food!",

    "text": "I was really excited to check this place out! I heard about their breakfast cocktails and knew immediately I needed to visit.  The first thing that really put me off was the entrance to the restaurant...... there is really no clear sign to distinguish the \"front\" door, they have two doors at the front of the building both on different sides, there were no signs outside pointing to the \"correct\" door, nor was the \"correct\" door propped open so when I approached the building- being that this was my first time here, I went to enter on the far left, and I noticed through the window that there were chairs in front of the door- as if to use them as a barrier, I was confused so when I reached for the door handle and the door opened I also noticed that there was no host podium near by and there was a family to my immediate left that was busy eating their breakfast...... That \"front entrance\" situation SERIOUSLY needs to be revised. One, the \"wrong\" door should not have been unlocked, two, put up a sign or something, it looked rather tacky having the chairs sitting in front of the door... my friend that I met with said she also did the same thing when entering and I also observed 3 other couples make the same \"mistake\".   I was slightly disappointed when the cereal shooters arrived- although they were delicious, I wish they were a little larger in size, or that 1/3 of the drink wasn't whip cream topping.. I also ordered the chicken tinga frittata, the taste was alright but was a little disappointed that the dish only came with 2 tortillas, especially since it was a $15 plate.... I feel 3-4 tortillas would have been appropriate for the price and for the amount of egg the plate comes with.  I definitely plan on coming back to try a different dish and to try out the Bloody Mary bar!",

We decided to come here because the reviews were all remotely good, wait time wasn't bad and food looked good.  It's basically a bar with loud club music. Not great for families or if you want to have a quiet breakfast to talk and relax.  Waitress could barely hear us as we ordered.  Food wasn't bad but lacked in some ways. We ordered the coconut - almost French toast: barely any syrup, never tasted almond, and only had like 5 small pieces of caramelized bananas (definitely not enough). So we ordered some more bananas that came out cold and chopped up in a cup that they charged us an extra $2 for.  Also ordered their Huevos Rancheros hash: meat was too tough, lacking in flavor. Honestly couldn't even taste the \"guacamole\" that was on top.  My friends ordered the avocado toast and said it was good so I guess that's something.  But we'll probably never be willing to come back here again.",

The menu is varied and everyone can find something that suits their taste.  I adore the chicken and waffles.  Even better than the food and coffee is the staff.  Dominic the manager comes by for a chat and to see how things are going every meal.  It is rare to find a restaurant where you feel so welcome, it's truly one of my favorites.",

Restaurant is very clean, modern decor, nice atmosphere. I went on a Friday, our server mentioned they have a DJ on the weekends. Food was great! I had the veggie scramble, veggies were fresh and crisp! I also had the mocha coffee which was very tasty. They have a Bloody Mary bar that we did not try this time but it looked great! My husband had the herb fried chicken hash, he enjoyed it a lot. Our girls had a kids waffle with fruit, they liked it and the fruit was fresh. Overall great experience, we will be back again soon!  Second visit as good as the first! Added pics below!",

    "text": "Well this was my 1st time here and will definitely be my last !  I have no idea where to start as from beginning to end , it just wasn't good. The service was awful, the manager did not listen, food was cold and tasteless, even after it was sent back. I just don't see the hype around this place.   My waitress from the beginning did not want to listen to what I wanted, i explained I was vegetarian but she did not go over the menu with me when I was trying to ask questions about topping that could be added from the list of veggies all she said was ok. So one would assume the others would come on it, well that's not the case she said she chose the four items I could have herself ..... huh ? Why would you not ask me have to choose the four toppings I like ? Nope,she decided to pick them. So of course I didn't like it ( SHOCKER). I asked for the eggs on the side as I don't eat them, they came out on top. ( I sent this back twice, I  was over it )  My husbands food was Luke warm ( biscuits & gravy ) he was so disappointed as this is his favorite. It Didn't have  much taste either. He had to ask for a straw three times and never got it. Could not get a refill of coffee to save his life. ( this is a weekday mind you. No one is in there). The manager came over, NEVER apologized for the miscommunication or food. Never asked me what was going on . Just was telling me what was on the menu and where I read it wrong. Obviously I said ,Since I don't work here she could  have told me, this is my options .....she was not concerned with my experience or cold food at ALL-  Bottom line they all seemed a bit on edge as well as rude.  I hope if you try this place it's better for you , definitely not on my top places to eat.",

    "text": "The atmosphere is awesome, no doubt about that. It's loud and fun. The wait is amazing, it's like waiting in line at a packed club for lunch on a weekend. It's definitely a spot to take out of town visitors for me. The prices are very high, the presentation of the food is terrific. It's definitely picturesque food porn. But now we get down to the taste:  Breakfast bruschetta: This was very good, some better than others with the 3 different flavors. But overall very good.   Chicken and waffles: the waffle was good, but the chicken was sooooo dry. Very disappointing because the presentation is so beautiful. Overall, not willing to try that out again. Could've just been this time, but for a $14 piece of chicken. I expect that thing to be tender and juicy.   Ranchero hash: It was good but nothing great. The carne asada was dry and very thin. It was tough to cut so you really ended up eating the meat way faster than the rest of the hash bowl. The amount of potatoes in the hash skillet is ridiculous.  Carne asada corn bread hash: same with this one, dry piece of meat but everything around it was good. For the price of these meals, the meat definitely needs some work.   Carnitas hash: probably the best one out of the bunch because the carnitas is somewhat cut up. So it's much easier to eat a little of the meat with the different combinations of sides.   S'mores French toast: AWESOME. But then again it's very hard to mess up French toast and adding Nutella, graham cracker, melted marshmallows, powdered sugar, and maple syrup will make just about anything taste amazing. Overall, damn good.   S'mores hot chocolate: $9?!? Really?!? The hot chocolate didn't even taste as good as the $1 pack of 4 Hershey's Pre mixed ones. The toppings of course were awesome, see the description of the s'mores French toast above. Overall, no way worth the price.   Chocolate coffee in a cone: the concept was very new to me. It didn't taste bad at all, but $10 is a little too much for a shot of coffee and a small waffle cone.   Overall, it's somewhere I'd probably visit a few times a year when I have visitors in town. But I wouldn't make this my regular weekend spot. They really do have some cool twists on breakfast food. But the looks definitely outshine the taste while the price is pretty damn expensive. 4 of us came out to $160",

First of all this is a breakfast restaurant yet at 9:00am Sunday morning you would think that it's a hip hop dance club. We had to yell over the music in order to talk to each other. I am a big fan of eggs Benedict so I ordered the original style and others ordered the specialty styles. When our food came everyone looked at mine and said \"what the heck is that\". It's as if they didn't even try to make the regular Eggs Benedict impressive at all in comparison to the others, it is plain, boring and small. Lastly, we ordered a bowl of fruit for our 2 year old and after she ate a couple of pieces we noticed that the pieces of fruit at the bottom of the bowl had been eaten already. I understand that trendy hipster restaurants are the new thing and I could of left peacefully with the loud music and half assed Eggs Benedict but serving food that has been eaten to a 2 year old is just plain unacceptable.",

    "text": "We've been looking at coming here for about 8 months since moving here across the country. Coming from New England we've been pressed hard to find a brunch place that rivalled that of our home favourites but this could certainly be it. Normally we shy away because of the line out the door but we got here about 8:30 on a Saturday and were able to get seated right away. We had very prompt service coffee and water within minutes of walking in the door and a very knowledgeable server let us know the crowd favourites. We ended up ordering the Corned Beef Poutine hash (ended up being to-go since our eyes were bigger than our stomachs), pretzel Benedict and Pineapple upside down pancakes. I got a pineapple mimosa and my friend got the cereal shooters. Overall was a great experience, came out quickly and was delicious. Huge portions. Domenic came over to ask about our experience, now, normally I get why the managers come around they're trying to check in so I usually brush them off with the yup everything was great and move on but Domenic seemed so genuine and sincere he genuinely was interested in our personal experience and let us know that if it's ever just the two of us the bar is almost always open so we can skip that line we've been avoiding for two months if that interests us he also let us know about their other resteraunt The Sicilian Butcher that we will definitely be trying out it the future. Thank you Domenic and your staff for a very enjoyable and delicious brunch experience. We will definitely be back.",

The over arching theme here is if they executed their recipes better it would easily be my go to spot.",

The service was excellent, the manager Dominic came by multiple times to chat and make sure everything was alright.

The highlight was Dom \"Guido\", our host.  He greeted us, and keep coming over to our table to see how we were doing.  So fun, friendly, and an all around great guy to have as the face of your establishment!  I would love to see a \"Sampler\" of many of the items on their menu - all sounded so good, and I want just a bite of each one.  Hopefully, next time we come back, they will have that.  And, we WILL be back - it is a shame they close so early (2:00 pm).  I could definitely spend more time at that Bloody Mary bar!  :)  Thanks, Dom Guido, for a wonderful breakfast!",

Everything was delicious and we cannot wait to go back to try some of the other items on the menu. It's going to be a difficult decision, because there is such a great selection.

Even with the place being busy he was attentive. I had the cereal shooters. Loved them! I never liked Captain Crunch as a kid so it surprised me that it was my favorite. Some of my coworkers had the mimosa flight which they said were good. I ordered Cristina's tamale cakes which were very tasty. The corn cakes had a sweet flavor so if you don't like sweet with your savory then this might not be for you. I like the 2 paired together. The only disappointment for me is the Brooklyn Brew that I ordered at the end. My fault for not reading the menu more thoroughly but I thought it had coffee in it because it was under the \"craft caffeine\" section. Holy cow that drink was strong! Anyway, it was supposed to come with a bomboloni and alas, mine was missing. :-(  If not for the missing bomboloni this would have definitely been 5 stars. Unfortunately, I didn't realize it was missing until I went to write the review or else I would have said something to our server. It was probably the shooters that dulled my memory. LOL! Anyway, we all had a lot of fun. I plan to return many more times now that I know it exists and is right down the road from me. I've got to try the chilaquiles next, or maybe the avocado toast or the monti cristo!",

He checked on us periodically which was nice (most supervisors or mangers at restaurants don't do that unless something wrong with the meal) and made us feel very welcomed.

The second time we came we brought our friends, so we had a party of 14 in total. Even with that large of a group at their busiest time, the team led by Dominic Viscariello (guest relations) made sure we were comfortable and got us seated as soon as possible.  Dominic came by and checked on us a few times to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. Our server Jessica was super-friendly and helpful. She made sure our friend's baby got food ASAP so as to prevent a potential meltdown. We even had three different checks based on families that were scattered about the long set of tables -- i.e. kids we sitting with their friends, adults were seated as couples but not next to their kids, etc. -- none of it was an issue for Jess.   The atmosphere, the food (including the mimosas), the friendly service.... and the DJ spinning the tunes during brunch... has made Hash Kitchen one of our favorite spots. We'll be going there regularly.",

I personally liked the music although I'm sure people with different preferences might not. There is an outdoor seating if the music is too loud.  We arrived at the restaurant around 9:30am and our wait time was approx 15 min they said but I think we were seated even earlier than that time.   Our waitress was sooo nice and although the restaurant was packed and bustling, she took her time to provide us with everything we needed and gave us recommendations from the menu. She consistently checked up on our table throughout our meal and gave us a warning beforehand that the size of each dish is large. For a family of three adults and one child we ordered three dishes and we were all stuffed by the end of it. Our dishes came out quite fast and we were stunned by the size and appearance of the dishes. I ordered the banana split french toast which was SO good. If you have a sweet tooth like I do in the morning, I highly recommend this dish!   Will be coming back here in the near future! We had a very great experience.",

Sat at the bar because I'm a bartender myself and usually that's where you get the best service. Not the case here. The bartenders act like you are being a pain in the ass. Admittedly we have been here for 2.5 hrs. But we have continually ordered either food or drinks and planned on paying our \"rent\". But the bartenders have such attitudes. And take forever to bring stuff you asked for even though you've paid for it. Not talking about refills, which they also suck at. Spent almost $150 here for 2 ppl and kind of regretting not just walking over to Whole Foods for a couple drinks. It's really unfortunate because their bar stools are super comfy and I could hang out and spend another $100.",

    "text": "I love Hash Kitchen! I am a sucker for anything brunch and this place takes brunch to the next level.  The food options have something for everyone. Although the prices seem a little high the amount of food you get is well worth it. Every time I come in I order something different and I have never been upset with any of the dishes.  The drink options make it even more of a fun experience. I ordered the Mega Boba Mimosa once and it was like I was at a carnival. The 25oz mimosa class topped off cotton candy and a pin wheel was such a treat. The Bloody Mary bar is also spectacular. They have so many different options.  Thanks to the staff for always making me feel welcome. Jessica, our server multiple times, is always smiling and very attentive. She goes above and beyond for her customers without any hesitation. Keri and Dominic (the managers) love the community and make a point to say hi to everyone with a smile. They remember there customers and have no problem taking by the time to get to know you. Don't miss this place. Even if it's as a special occasion to treat yourself it's worth it.",

I would plan to get on a wait list if coming on the weekend's. However, Monday I was able to get seated without having to wait. That being said, I had the Avocado Toast which was amazing! A little messy which I didn't mind because the food was great! Service was fast, which was awesome.  Great experience overall!!",

I've been going to their N Scottsdale location for years and received the same great food on both occasions in Chandler.  Service was spotty the first time, but it appears they are still training lots of staff and they made it right with a free donut with cannoli filling.  We had the Italian Hash, Gluten Free Pancakes and Bacon.  Dominic stopped by the table to check in on us as well.  Love HK!",

I ended up getting corned beef Benedict which came served on a fried potato patty. We decided to share the gigantic Bloody Mary to try out the bar. So let me just tell you we did not look at the price when we got this and to our surprise this Bloody Mary cost more than our food. About $30 so you best believe we loaded our Bloody Mary with three of everything in the bar. To be honest we could have just had that as our meal the thing was HUGE! The vibe here is really cool, a DJ anywhere is always a good time. Dominic was super sweet and attentive as a manager should be. I'd give this place more stars but I just think $30 for a Bloody Mary is insane but maybe I'm just a cheap college student? Food was amazing, vibe is great, Bloody Mary was intense.",

Though we chose not to partake in the Bloody Mary bar or mimosa flight, it all looked amazing and Instagram-worthy. We ordered the Pretzel Benedict and the Corned Beef Benedict and were impressed my how quickly it came out based on how busy it was! My Benedict was so good I didn't even take a picture. Poached eggs, bacon, beer cheese and fried onion strings atop a warm soft pretzel? Sign me UP! Dominic, the manager on duty came to the table at the end of our meal and made sure we were having a great experience which really elevated everything! Having been open only 7 weeks I'm impressed! This place will be a new favorite of ours! See you again soon!",

He suggested the Crab Benedict which I ordered. I absolutely loved it!  Great suggestion!  Our waiter made his rounds at the appropriate times. Domenic, the Guest Relations rep, stopped by our table and introduced himself.  He was making sure that we were being taken care of to our satisfaction.  The place had a fun and inviting atmosphere.

If you expect to go somewhere for a quiet cup of joe and some bland food this is not your place.  This place is FUN!! My mom, son and I went here for brunch this AM. I loved that it was loud enough so my 3 year old could just be a toddler without people judging us. I did the Bloody Mary bar and my mom did a mimosa flight, both were delicious! To eat I got the Bacon Board with an assortment of bacon, cheese, fig jam and bagels... yum. The jalapeno bacon was AMAZING. My mom got the avocado toast which is HUGE!! Oh my gosh that looked like a ton of food. So worth it. And my son got the chocolate chip pancakes which were delicious also.  Food was great. Drinks great. The manager Dominic was very welcoming and genuinely made sure all of the customers in the restaurant were having a great time. We will definitely be back again!",

We waited an hour and they told us they were running behind.  After another 20 minutes we found 2 seats at the bar,  so we just seated ourselves.  I love avocado toast, so that is what I ordered.  Let me warn you, if you love avocado toast, do not order the avocado toast here. It is 2 very thick pieces of brioche with a very, very thin layer of avocado spread topped with a shredded sweet pork, a layer of thick slab bacon, an egg and greasy fried shoestring onions.  There is nothing light or healthy about this dish, which in and of itself is not a bad thing.  But there was no relief from it.  Not an herb, fruit or leaf of any kind on the plate. It was extremely heavy.  I did not enjoy it.  My friend had the berry pancakes.  He was saddened by the fact that there were very few berries in his dish.  The batter itself was tasty but the blueberries were scarce at best. And on top of the pancakes was a very simple garnish of a few blueberries and half of a strawberry.  The coffee was just ok.  They serve lots of cocktails that look interesting, but i don't see myself coming back to try them.  I believe the place would benefit from improved management, and a more thoughtful approach to preparing and serving dishes.",

I feel like I am clubbing in Miami. Second I'm not a day drinker which could explain why I felt the music noise level was awful. We literally had to shout to talk to each other. Third I don't enjoy waiting 30 minutes from the time I order to get my food. This doesn't count for the 15 minutes I waited to sit and the 10 plus minutes I waited to give my order. As for The food it was flavorful for the most part although they reinvented food styles that didn't need reinventing IMHO. Pancakes were very good. Eggs cooked excellent. But it was a huge miss for me. I guess my expectations were out of line for this experience. I was there for a yummy relaxing brunch and that place was not relaxing. I won't be back unless it's a day drinking bachelorette or some other booze fest clubbing day.",

From there we were seated and waited on by the sweetest waitress who had great recommendations for first time here. It was very difficult to make a decision because everything on the menu looks so good! Our food was absolutely delicious! Cannot wait to go back for the Bloody Mary bar and to try something different on the menu.",

    "text": "I had a terrible experience at Hash Kitchen in Chandler today. A woman who was clearly overly intoxicated caused a scene and said the worst thing a person can say to another person. It was not only uncomfortable for me but for the family standing behind us and the employees that witnessed it. I was shaking and very confused why a random person would threaten my safety at a restaurant at 11:30 in the morning. I told the hostesses what had happened and they were very thoughtful and comforting. The general manager named Anh was anything but helpful. After myself and the employee that witnessed the incident told the manager what had happened he said he would talk to the woman. I watched him walk away from me and never actually speak to the woman that threatened me and caused a scene. I also told him that I thought she was overly intoxicated but they kept serving her at the bar anyway. This was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had and I'm extremely disappointed that the general manager wasn't able to make the situation better or make me feel comfortable. Because of this I left the restaurant and my friends and I will never be back. It's important that customers not only have a good time at your establishment but feel safe. It may be uncomfortable to cut someone off from drinking but as a server (especially the GM) of a restaurant it's your job to make sure guests are not over served and to deal with any issues involving an overly intoxicated person appropriately.",

    "text": "I recently had breakfast at Hash Kitchen with my husband and 3-year old daughter. The food was very good for the most part, but I'm giving it only three stars because the music is incredibly loud. So much so that's it's difficult to have a conversation. My daughter was really bothered by the noise level and wanted to leave, which is unusual for her as she enjoys being at restaurants. I wanted to like this place because of the food quality, but the overall experience was sub standard due to the noise level. Judging by the crowds, this isn't an issue for many people but if you're someone who wants to enjoy a nice breakfast with family or friends while carrying on a conversation, this is not the place. I will say, however, that the food is very good overall. The only exception is the gluten free pancakes, which were terrible (Snooze, by comparison, has great gluten free pancakes). As for the service, it was about average, although the servers are very friendly. Another good aspect of this place is the decor. They did a great job with the interior. If it weren't for the noise, we would return but won't be going back because the excessively loud music made for a poor experience.",

The first time I went, we ended up waiting a little bit (30-45 min?) but I generally am used to waits so it really didn't bother me, plus there's a bar and ample waiting space for you to occupy yourself within that time.  I ordered the avocado toast hash style and I'm not sure if I'm more excited to visit my boyfriend or visit Hash just for that meal when I come back(don't tell him). Last time I visited we went straight to the bar and ended up staying there for our whole meal and Dominic started up a chat and we got into a serious convo about furniture shopping. Let me tell you, he really went above and beyond to help us out with our shopping quest that day and he was so nice!  Safe to say, I'll definitely be coming back!",

We did have to wait a while to get seated but we had a larger group.   Every menu item we ordered was amazing. The two stars, for me, were the bacon board and the cannoli doughnuts. I was completely floored. Wish I had a chance to try more items on the menu. Someday I will.   If you have a chance to eat here, do it. Amazing.",

His manager Dominic came to our table and greeted us and thanked us for coming in and also checked up on us after our meals. He was extremely welcoming and loved our 7 month old daughter (who appreciated their avocados lol) We've brought friends with us everytime to introduce them to this place. The mimosa flight, fried chicken Benedict, breakfast bruschetta and mini bagels are an absolute must try! Thank you Jesus for making our visit to hash kitchen delicious and fun everytime.",

    "text": "I had been meaning to make it to Scottsdale to check this place out for quite some time now but never quite made it up there. Then one day the Paradise Bakery next to my cycle studio was suddenly closed and I saw the signs for Hash Kitchen - coming soon! I have been so excited since then and finally made it in today.   This place is absolutely everything it is cracked up to be and then some! The Bloody Mary bar was insane and even included meatballs and chicken wings. The 25oz boba mimosas definitely caught my eye too. We ended up going with the mimosa flight and the cereal shooter flight, both of which were outstanding!   The service was spot on. Our server, Kim, was everything you want in a server, especially when it is your first time visiting a place. She was knowledgeable and patient with us and she made great recommendations. It would be easy for a server in a busy place like this to rush her tables through the dining experience, but she took her time and made us feel like we were her only table. One of the managers, Dominic, was also outstanding. He introduced himself to us and took the time to tell us about the place and genuinely wanted to make sure our experience was fantastic, which it most certainly was.   As far as the food, we were only able to scratch the surface and will definitely need to come back multiple times to try everything that stood out on the menu. The highlights for me were the breakfast bruschetta, the peanut butter infused pancakes, and the s'mores French toast. The avocado toast that my friends ordered also looked incredible, but I stuck with the sweet stuff today.   Definitely will be back again and again, and definitely will request Kim as my server. Great experience, atmosphere, food, and beverages! Great everything!",

    "text": "*UPDATED REVIEW* After an amazing first experience (see below for my initial review) we were super excited to go back and try something new from the menu. We were seated quickly and told our server would be around to greet us soon. Well, maybe 10 mins later some guy rolls up, doesn't look at us, doesn't say anything. Just starts filling up our glasses with water. He then stood there and stared at us until he asked \"want anything other then water guys?\" We were so confused whether or not he was our server and were so uncomfortable. We gave him our drink orders which came out in about another 10 mins. He then said \"do you know what you want to order?\" And we ordered. He never came back to check on us, we were never even told his name. I haven't ever had such poor service. We ended up going to the bar if we needed anything or snagging another nearby server. We left feeling disappointed to say the least as our first experience was stellar. According to the receipt, our server's name was \"Souflane\". I will likely go back because the food is so good, but I will refuse to sit in his section ever again. Hopefully this guy will get the training he needs. *ORIGINAL REVIEW* I didn't think I could love any brunch more than Snooze...until I tried Hash Kitchen! I can't remember our server's name, but she said she is the Duchess of the place and she did not disappoint! We loved the Bloody Mary bar so much! I loved the fruity pebbles pancakes and my husband really enjoyed the pretzel Benedict. We will be back FOR SURE. #droolworthy",

Busy.  Expected.  My eggs were so over cooked and dry I sent them back.  Lost appetite.  My husband's pretzel Benedict came with HARD boiled yolks.  See photo.  The manager in white shirt comes over to me and says \"what's wrong\" I tell him \"my husbands Benedict has a hard yolks\" to which he replies \"what should they be\" to which I replied, eggs benedict, drippy yolk, not hard boiled.  To which he replied \"I know\".  Daughters boyfriend ordered the carnitas hash, super dry eggs but was too hungry to send them back.  My father in law the birthday boy hated his Benedict crab and said the Hollandaise did not taste like hollondaise.  Over all - great atmosphere, great menu, incompetent kitchen.  4/11 plates dry/over cooked after an hour wait.   Husbands second plate arrives.  What appears to be owner asks \"how is it\" husband cuts into a medium boiled yolk this time and is so starving, doesn't care and says \"perfect\" because it's two hours since we walked in door.  Fun place for friends/drinks/vibe, but won't come back to eat.   Of course, if you drink more, you will notice less.    If the food changes, or entire kitchen staff turns over, invite us back!!",

I was very shocked by this & thought that someone in the kitchen was not doing there job.  I told the waitress, & they happily made another order.  It was disappointing to say the least, especially with the prices they charge.  Finally, I stepped into the restroom before leaving, both stalls had absolutely not toilet paper.  Surely they must check the restrooms on a routine basis for cleanliness, & supplies.  Overall, I can only give a 2 star rating for a restaurant I normally give 4 or 5 stars to.",

Not to mention we love the same football team as him.  This morning I tried the chilaquiles and they were delicious. Definitely had a bit of a kick to them, so if you don't mind a hint of spice..you will love them!  My son tried the infused fruity pebbles pancakes.  They were a hit!  My husband tried the Monte Cristo & fries.  Needless to say we all left there feeling completely satisfied.   High energy, staff is always wonderful, the music and atmosphere make you feel like you are ready to party and get your Sunday started on the right foot!  Welcome to Chandler Hash Kitchen!!!  GO PATRIOTS!!",

I told my waitress and bar tender that I wanted a mimosa with a lot of champagne and a little orange juice. They filled my glass full of champagne and gave it 6 drops of orange juice. THAT IS HOW I LIKE IT. Huge thank you to our waitress Audrina, she took great care of us and very very friendly and attentive. Also thank you to Domenic who made our experience extra special and made sure everything was top notch for us. I'm coming back with my girlfriends tomorrow or the next day. THANK YOU!",

Understandable, it's Sunday brunch. However, no \"hi\", no smiles. We were asked if we wanted drinks. Ordered them. Took a few minutes but no biggie. After 20 minutes we had to flag her down to order food. The food was delivered, no one asked if we needed anything, or if we got the correct order even. No condiments offered no check back whatsoever. We had to ask the bar back for salt and pepper and hot sauce and ketchup. Then we had to flag her down to get our check. We're at the bar top!!! She's been standing in front of us for two hours and has barely uttered more than a couple sentences and not smiling at all. They look overwhelmed and stressed and too worried about putting out the orders from service bar (where there was another bartender) than she was worried that her bar guests were having a good experience. The place is all about experience, hence the DJ. The bar was the most unfriendly and non experience that I've seen for such a well thought and executed concept.",

I ordered the banana split French toast. It was spectacular! Decadent! Delicious! The coffee was full bodied as I like it. My husband had the corned beef hash scramble. He enjoyed his choice as well.  The second time we went we brought a cousin traveling with the Detroit Lions. It was Brunch Time, this time at the Scottsdale location. This time I ordered the overnight oats. It was wonderful. It never tastes that good when I made it! My husband had the corned beef sandwich which he raved about. The cousin we brought along had the burger with egg and avocado and onion crisps and aioli on it. (I forgot the name of it) He was also enthusiastic about his choice. Cousin also had the mimosa fleet which he enjoyed. I would wholeheartedly, enthusiastically recommend this place! Service was prompt and friendly at both places. Go....no... run to this place!",

If you can catch a seat with shade it's rather comfortable. The Bloody Mary bar was excellent! DIY! The choices were so many, and a little confusing. I suggest asking for a tour guide to assist with getting the best for your $12!

I'd like to go back to rate the service at an actual table, because sitting at the bar i think we got forgotten about a little bit. It took nearly an hour to get their bacon board appetizer by itself. The XXL mimosas we ordered were just about gone by the time the food came. But i will say that the bacon board was delicious and so was the drink. The environment is noisy, they have a DJ playing music, but it's great for a fun brunch! Not so much if you want to have a serious conversation (but who does that over brunch anyways right lol). I'll definitely be back to sample some more things on the menu. I would have given it 5 stars had it not been for the extremely long wait for the food, oh and some bare hand contact with the fruits and veggies being used for the drinks. I saw a lot of items being cut up and hands being wiped on jeans after and going right back to cutting up another item... I'm hoping this was just because of the rush and being forgetful. I also wish their parking situation was a bit different, the lot in front fills up quickly from the neighboring businesses so you end up having to park down at the Whole Foods and walking. Which isn't great when it's 100+ outside, not a deal breaker but plan accordingly. All of these things aside it seems like a solid choice for brunch. I'll definitely be back!",

Came back with the wife 2 months later to see if a party of 2 would have better luck and we did.  A wide variety of unique food; we went for the Hash menu (after all it is in the name).  Generally very good and very filling.  My wife likes her eggs to be more runny so she was slightly disappointed.  I am just not as much of a sweets fan otherwise there would have been much more of a selection for me.  We knew it would be pricey (and gourmet), but we left full and pretty satisfied - just didn't feel as though we had been shocked or amazed by something extraordinary.  Very very good service from friend folks.  Music so loud it was not always easy to hear one another.  If you want a unique date and feel you can spend extra, this is a good pick.  Not sure we will be regulars though.",

We were seated quickly by friendly staff and we didn't have to wait long at all for our food despite it being quite busy in the restaurant! The last time we went for breakfast on my girlfriends birthday and the manager Dominic sent over a birthday dessert for free. Excellent customer service and great food! Already planning a get together with friends to come back!",

So many choices from the salt rim, type of vodka, spice level to tons of toppings....this will be any Bloody Mary fan's new favorite place! Innovative menu like the bacon board or sweet potato hash with crab meat and hollandaise sauce to fruity pebble pancakes. Lots of yummy choices!! Large portion sizes and fun beverages. Dominick (one of the managers) is supper friendly and helpful. A DJ spinning tunes makes the atmosphere lively. An all around fun and yummy place for breakfast or brunch! Great for a group of friends or even by yourself as the staff is super friendly! The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is the corned beef hash appeared to be from a can vs fresh shredded corned beef ;-)",

At first I wasn't sure we were welcomed, at the hostess stand I cheerfully requested a table for two. One of the young ladies responded with it be 20 minutes maybe 55 minutes. Then went back to looking at her list. I stood there unsure of why she didn't ask if we would to wait. Finally I said aren't you going to take my name? No sorry, no smile, just a blank stare and unenthusiastic what's the name and she handed me a waitlist pager. We waited outside in the shade under misters enjoying awesome old school music. The pager went off in just 20 minutes. In under 30 seconds we were greeted by our server.  Impressive!  My husband did the Bloody Mary bar and loved it! Lots of food options on the menu. Potions were huge and delicious. I really wanted to get up and dance, the DJ was awesome.   We think this is our go to place for any out of town guest to provide an entertaining brunch.   Upon exiting the other ladies at the hostess stand were friendly and wished us a good day.   It would have been a 5 star experience if the one lady at the hostess stand had been welcoming oppose to indifferent.",

If you're really into the taste to price ration of the food, then maybe come somewhere else.  I've been to almost all of the locations in AZ (yes, I'm basic lol) and they're all upbeat and CROWDED sis, so the environment is very fun- it's almost like a party which is what I think they're going for which is dope, but its really really loud, so it's hard to really converse with people at your table. The wait on weekends are like 45 mins - an hour max which is a long time to wait if you just tryna get some eggs benedictine cha feel? I also feel like the food is kinda pricey for what you get. The drinks are pricey, but I personally don't mind paying a little extra for the cool bloody Mary bar, alcoholic boba, and other cool specialty drinks.  Overall, would i recommend, yeah but it depends on the mood. I wouldn't say this is an intimate brunch place but it's still lit",

Lots of parking spaces, however the sectioned off spots near the entrance do fill up quick during peak hours. Our server Jesus was beyond amazing. Attentive, charismatic about the popular dishes and overall a stand up dude willing to cater to our tables needs.  The food. Where to begin. I was drooling by the sight of each and every dish that was brought to our table. The portion sizes could feed a small family, so come hungry- this does offset the price tag for the meal, somewhat. I ordered the Herb Fried Chicken Benedict and my boyfriend chose the Lemon & Ricotta, which came recommended by our server. My food was savory and simply delicious, lots of flavor. The biscuits paired perfectly with the fried chicken that was not heavily battered, which I appreciated.   Did I mention they have a Build your own Bloody Mary bar? They say it's the biggest in Arizona, go see for yourself.   They do have a DJ playing on the weekends; some may say it is geared more towards a younger crowd, with a creative twist on most dishes. It is an upbeat place, so if you don't appreciate a louder environment this place may not be for you- try the closest IHOP instead. Loved the overall atmosphere, cute mugs, and the diverse selection on the menu. It is a cool place to brunch out. There's nothing like it in our neighborhood, I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "We have been coming here for 3 weekends straight to try to get in but it's always an hour or longer wait.  Finally, we got in after a 25 minute wait.  While waiting, you can head on up to the Bloody Mary bar to purchase your drink and add all the toppings you want, including hot meatballs!  If this is your thing, then go on with your bad self.  Not a fan of Bloody Mary's so we skipped that line.    We sat down inside were the DJ is spinning club tunes under the disco ball.  As we scan the room, we felt like we were in an episode of Phoenix House Wives!  As we watched the fufu drinks with cotton candy wrapped around two straws (cotton candy straws will set ya back $10...doesn't include cost of drink) and the many selfies being taken, we quickly calculated that this was more of an adult, club like setting only with brunch being served.    We received great service and overall had a good meal.  I ordered the banana French brioche which was huge, tasty but very sweet.  Only ate half.  My husband ordered the Italian hash dish.  The presentation was great on both meals.  But there was one thing missing from the dish....HASH!  Frozen diced potatoes with onions and green peppers is something I can pick up from the store!   When you come to a place with HASH in the title and HASH noted all over the place....you expect hash brown style potatoes in your meal.  And the eggs which look poached are over cooked!  The yolk should be runny, not well done.    Being a licensed chef, I can tell you from personal experience that when you have a large menu like this and the large amounts of dishes that need to be prepared and put out, your kitchen has far too many things prepared ahead of time.  Eggs are one of those dishes you can't prepared ahead of time unless you're hard boiling them.   And honestly...don't call a establishment Hash Kitchen if you don't serve hash!  That's like calling a a place a steakhouse but you don't have steaks on the menu. #Falseadvertising #chainrestaurantfail  If what you want to pay for is the ambiance and enjoy # tagging away at the selfie station, then by all means, wait for a table that comes with a #BIG$$$tag  Personally, we came, we waited, we ate, we left and we won't be back.  Granted we got two drinks (over $10.00 each); walked away spending over $60.00 for a breakfast not cooked right and no HASH for two people just having breakfast.    If you want both great service and food with little to no wait, I highly recommend that you skip this hash without the hash place and head to Matt's Big Breakfast or Downtown Chandler Cafe and Bistro.  Fresh food prepared the right way that won't break the bank.",

The service is amazing. I mean, I came in by myself to meet my boyfriend and his best friend, they greeted me, were so nice (every person behind the bar) that they reserved two extra seats at the bar and while this may have pissed people off and made me look like a jerk, it was only for a few minutes and this is due to how packed this place is and parking so far away. No big deal, I got a pineapple mimosa and it was amazing!! My wonderful boyfriend got the Mimosa flight and our friend here from Iowa got the 32 ounce build your bloody. I got the smaller bloody with cilantro lime vodka. I made a bloody masterpiece!!! I came back from the bloody bar after meeting with Dominick and I must say, such a nice gentleman! He is the owner and makes a point to meet and greet every guest, stellar!  Oh, now on to the food....gosh, I am boring. I like two eggs over and dry toast. It came out perfect, eggs cooked just like they were requested. My better two thirds got the crab hash. This dish was excellent. It consisted of sweet potatoes that were shredded, eggs cooked however you want (scrambled in this case) and hollandais-ish sauce accompanied by a very generous portion of crab! Our friend got Fruity Pebble pancakes with a side of maple bacon. It was ridiculous, ridiculous is good. The bacon he got should seriously be patented. It was that good.   Thanks :)",

    "text": "This place is brunch on steroids. Lol! My friend brought us here because she raved about the cereal shooters and the live DJ from her previous visit.  We got in an hour before closing and they were packed. Unfortunately no DJ this time around! We were seated quickly and seeing how busy they were we had to wait a little and eventually flag down our server to place our drink and food orders before it got too late. I started with a Bloody Mary from the Build Your Own Bloody Mary Bar (BYOBM) and the girls ordered a Lights Out Mimosa, French Vanilla Coffee In A Cone and the Mimosa Flight. I have never seen drinks like these before. I commend the BYOBM for letting you totally customize your Bloody Mary to the T (try their bacon infused vodka). For $13 you get to choose from 40+ toppings and make the Bloody Mary of yo dreams. The Mimosa Flight was also very generous, each serving was HUGE and they were strong. That's how Mimosas should always be.  As for our meals we ordered the S'Mores French Toast, Corned Beef Hash, Herb Fried Chicken And Waffles and the Mexicana Scrambler. These portions are no joke.. we ordered enough to feed a small village. As were were wrapping up one of the managers, Domenic came by to greet us and have a conversation with us. I was telling him how excited I was over the BYOBM Bar and he even let me go back to try some more of the toppings. Thank you Domenic for your hospitality!  When we got our checks there was a little misunderstanding regarding the order of my friend's French Vanilla Coffee In A Cone, but it was resolved immediately. As we were one of the last few to leave we did not feel rushed by any means to wrap up our brunch.  What a fun place! Coming back next time.",

We definitely thought we could take it down but between the endless olives, meatballs, bacon, pickles and more we were wrong.  We sat out back behind the Bloody Mary bar while we waited for our table. Made some good conversation with the other patrons.   When we got our table we were able to see the entire restaurant including the bar and the tv. (Basketball was on.)   We orders Herb chicken and waffle, and sweet cornbread and carne asada. Oh My Goodness. We could have had one plate to be quite honest. It's so much food.   Throughout the mean not only did our waiter check on us but the manager Dominic did. He not only talked to us about the history of the location but also talked about further plans of a sister restaurant.   We already have plans to bring all our friends and I cannot wait!",

I originally tried this place back in March on my 1st trip to Scottsdale so when we decided to come to phoenix in August we had to come here again. We were excited to see a location opened up in the Phoenix area and I can't even believe the restaurant got better. The new menu options are out of this world. The new location offers a walk up bar that you can order from while you wait for your table. We came on a Sat for brunch and even with a party of 4 we only waited about 35 minutes. We got the avocado toast which can easily feed 3 people. The crunchy bread with the sweet braised pork was to die for. I can't stop thinking about it! The carnitas hash is an absolute must. The BYO bloody mary bar is Amazing. The meatballs were so flavorful I'm pretty sure we ate about 10 of those before we even ordered. We also ordered the sausage biscuits and gravy, the brioche french toast and the poutine breakfast fries. Everything was amazing. David, one of the managers I believe, came around greeting all the guests and he was incredible and so attentive to our table. We begged him to tell the owners to please open one of these in Sacramento, CA!!! Do not miss this place! Atmosphere is so cool as well as amazing food.",

My wife and I picked the biscuit and gravy w/sausage.  We were also curious about the banana French toast, so we ordered that to split.   Both our meals were cold and the sausage was dry. I told our waitress, and she said she'd have another brought out. I HATE this solution, but she didn't offer an alternate.   My wife wasn't interested and decided to continue nibbling on the semi-warm sections of food on her plate.  I ended up eating 80% of the French toast while waiting the 15 minutes for my replacement meal.  The French toast was very good and hot.  After waiting the 15 minutes, I was no longer excited to see the new plate arrive. While hot; it was a waste.  The French toast had filled me up.  Food sometimes comes out cold.  To me, there's nothing worse than waiting for the replacement to arrive. I wish the waitress had offered to take it off the bill, or simply did it on her own.  We won't be back.",

The pancakes were phenomenal and had a tasty cream cheese filling between each layer of pancakes. They don't mess around with portion sizes at this restaurant. The Brunch Lasagna was HUGE. Between the two of us we were only able to put a dent in about 1/3 of the lasagna. The vibe here was phenomenal and the service was quick. Definitely will be one of my regular brunch spots out here in the valley.",

Being there was fun, the drinks were presented nice and were strong, but the food was kinda underwhelming. I had the bacon omelette and I subbed mushrooms for onion. There was hardly any seasoning and bacon in the egg, and the hash potatoes it came with weren't anything to rave about. My friend had the impossible burger, he said it was good, but nothing special. We also ordered the lights out mimosa in the passionfruit strawberry flavor that our server recommended. It was tasty and the cotton candy and little juice balls in them were a fun touch.  Sean was our server and he gave us good service. Parking was easy on a Saturday afternoon for us.",

They have plenty of options and even a Bloody Mary Bar, which I have never seen before.   WARNING : The portions are HUGE lol  The avocado toast could feed four people I think   The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because it did take a bit to get service after we were seated. This was at 11:00 on a Wednesday. This is double edge sword because it shows you just how good and popular the place is.   Either way, highly recommend and will be going back to try different dishes and the Bloody Mary bar when I'm not working.",

Everyone was happy sipping on Brunch drinks and diving into their huge helpings of food.   The mimosa flights are a huge hit. They're colorful and vibrant and taste great!  You get a good amount of bubbly in each flight. They're also a great size to have a flight round and one additional drink.   There's a huge mimosa drink called the lights out (I believe). It has a whole bottle of champagne in it so be prepared to share... or not lol.   I tried my luck with the carne asada and cornbread hash. It was so flavorful and I couldn't get enough of the cornbread. My only complaint would be the steak being super chewy on some parts but it didn't take away from the amazing flavors of the dish.   All the portions are big so come prepared on an empty stomach!",

Manager Dominic came by the table and asked pointed questions about the food, the service AND the amount of time the food took to come out - it was blazing fast.

There was already a pack of people waiting to be seated. We were given an estimate of 45~ minutes.   Upon arrival I noticed the place was sha-poppin'. They had a DJ playing and it was like being at a day club. They had plenty of seating including the bar and patio. I also love that they had a DIY Bloody Mary bar - awesome concept. Plenty of people were grabbing one while they waited.   After waiting closer to 70 minutes, we decided to give up our wait for a table and snagged a seat at the bar (bar is first come first serve).   We were helped once seated and placed our orders. Portions are huge and food was yummy. What enticed me the most was the creative drinks they offer. I ordered coffee in a cone (alcoholic + non alcoholic available). They also had mimosa and cereal flights on top of plenty of other delicious choices.   Decor is very trendy- they even have one of those selfie cameras w/ the lights around it. A cool place to brunch just make sure you're not going right as you get hangry. Wait is worth though. #hashhashbaby",

Getting seated however,  took over 2 hours esp when we were told 1 hour 15 mins......i was a tad bit disappointed in the hostess' for not regrouping and suggesting us be split on diff tables or something...the group was getting antsy waiting in the heat. I suggest the restaurant team look into a 2 hour limit for guests...atleast for large tables. Makes things move smoother for everyone.   However, when seated our waitress was great and our meals delicious. I ordered the chilaquiles and the chicken tinga was very tasty! I haven't found a place that makes it as well.  Others shared the avocado toast it being a large portion. The rest of the group ordered various things but everyone enjoyed their meals. The mimosa flights were definitely popular. You didn't get to select your flavors though just what is preselected.  I'd come back but maybe a smaller group to get seated quicker:)",

We were seated right away (beat the brunch rush by arriving at 8:30 AM on a Saturday) and the waitress was there a few second later to take our drink orders.   I ordered the Chilaquiles and it was easily the best breakfast dish I have had. I am excited to come back soon to try several other things I saw on the menu and things tables near us ordered.  The manager, Dominic, stopped by twice to make sure everything was good and chat. Super nice guy and gave us a card to check out the other restaurant he manages (The Italian Butcher).",

The place is trendy with some nice wall graphics, blue & white seatings and a very nice bar set up. We were seated immediately but the service was a little slow considering there were only a few people at the restaurant.  We quickly ordered chicken frittata, French toast and veggie burger with fries. There was a little bit of a wait for the food to arrive.  Chicken frittata was average and not exceptional. The chilli sauce on the egg definitely made it better. The winner was the French toast and veggie burger. The toast had perfect amount of sweet, had some marshmallows and banana as a topping. The burger had yummy crispy onions inside with veggie patty.   The food portion was pretty big and we were all full by end of the meal. The average cost is about $15 per person. Overall a good brunch place, would definitely want to try other menu items. Keeping this place on my rotation.",

My boyfriend had the Lemon Meringue French Toast and I had the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict and it was my first time ever trying hollandaise sauce. They delivered a French press machine TO OUR TABLE so we knew we were getting exactly what we paid for. Ugh I'm so pleased with my our experience and we will definitely be coming back asap! The food isn't too expensive and what you splurge on is definitely worth your money! The management is very kind too. Great staff, great food, great environment. I love it.",

    "text": "First time to Chandler location, third time overall. I really like this place and given they have only been open for a short time service and food was good. This place has loads of personality, including the upbeat and trendy interior to your hosts, all from Back East. Today we met Guido (middle name by the way)from Cape Cod area. He is one of the managers and stopped by a couple of times to check on our food and our service. This time around I had to try the Cannoli pancakes, I just couldn't resist. The stack was huge, I made it about half way through and they were a little thicker than I like (but that is personal preference of mine, I prefer thinner). They came with syrup and a maraschino cherry compote/syrup. I didn't use much of any of it because the mascarpone with chocolate chips between each pancake made it sweet enough. Also got a side of bacon which honestly was a great price (I paid $5 for 3 pieces last weekend at the Original Pancake House). The hubby got Chicken and Waffles, he said it was good but comes topped with a ton of fried onions, easy to remove like my hubby did.  The only concern and it was minor is that I ordered an iced almond milk mocha and it was given to me with whipped cream on it.  Luckily I can have a little bit of milk, but I despise whipped cream on my iced drinks. With an alternate milk being asked for they should leave it off or at a minimum ask. Past experiences were good as well, the Coconut Almond French Toast is good, not overalls sweet and the hubby had the Huevos Rancheros and Carnitas Hash. I am not a Bloody Mary fan but if I was this would be the place I would come as the make your own Bloody bar is pretty epic. Overall looking forward to coming here more often now that it is slightly closer for me. Would love for one to come out to Mesa or Gilbert. The challenge I have is that so many things sound good but honestly the portions are large and I should share with the hubby but we can't come to a compromise. Tough problem to have I know. See you again soon Hash Kitchen.",

We shared French toast which was not only enormous slices of bread, but absolutely yummy. Great service too. Our server and the manager, Domenic, were very attentive. We were greeted immediately with friendly smiles. Nice size patio, very comfortable.",

We were given the option to sit inside or sit outside we opted for outside, the service was impeccable it took approximately seven minutes from the time that we ordered to table. The manager, Dominic was absolutely amazing we have dubbed him \"the little Italian\"! Our server was Rachel and she was awesome constantly making sure we had enough to drink make sure if it was tasting good, it was so good we let our friends know and they showed to come eat. We then went home picked up our kids and brought them back, and I indulged in the giant Mimosa. We will definitely be back to try other menu items. We had the sweet potato crab hash... 2 thumbs up!",

We go to this location almost every Sunday we can. Portion sizes are perfect to share with friends and the food is delicious. There is something for everyone from pastries to down home food with a modern twist. The build your own Bloody Mary bar has over 40 items to choose from and make sure to get the MEATBALLS!!! If Bloody Mary isn't your thing try the mimosa flight or the giant mimosa with a full bottle of champagne!!! Small not there is a live DJ spinning for brunch on Sundays but the music adds to the awesome atmosphere. Will continue to go back anytime we can. Thanks Geno for the great hospitality and making us feel like family.",

Two of the managers, Dominic and Summer, introduce themselves and made sure we were well taken care of. I like the variety and the eclectic nature of their menu. I think prices are fair given the quality and the portion size. I had the mid iron steak hash, and the steak was done to perfection and was extremely tender. The poached eggs were also perfect. My friend enjoyed the Montecristo, and was surprised with the fresh pineapple that really set off the sandwich. The fries were also amazing, and fries or something that you often don't think about.  Definitely recommended and I will be going back.",

If you're into a variety of mimosas and plenty of bloodily Mary topping then I highly recommended this place. Ohh not to mention to fill your belly with delicious brunching food.   However, you should expect to wait at least an hour or so during peak brunch hours. I wasn't to amazed with their service. After waiting for an hour for our table we waited another 15 minutes to get attended to. We actually had to ask someone who our server was.To compensate for that mishap, we did end up getting $5 off our meal from the manager of the restaurant.   All in all I recommend this place for the drinks, food and atmosphere. It can get very noisy which may bother people, but if you're looking for a good Sunday Funday this is the place.",

    "text": "I went twice over the weekend. Friday morning was loud but not too extreme. My girlfriend and I had a lovely time and the manager even came and visited for quite some time asking how everything was. He was super nice and did a great job going around to the tables. Saturday morning, we took friends from Scottsdale and it was a completely different story. It was so loud, we were screaming across the table. We asked our waitress if they could turn the music down and she said they aren't allowed to- What?! That's terrible customer service. She even commented that she's having to yell at her customers! I love the look of the place, the food, and the service! For those, I give 3 stars...I understand wanting to have a lively place, but a nightclub feel at 10 am on Saturday morning isn't really enjoyable. I'm so sad because I loved my mimosa flight and the Bloody Mary bar looks amazing! My friend did that and she said the choices are endless! If you may be thinking we are just old and can't handle loud music, my husband has an app on his phone that ranks decibels and it was 95 decibels on Saturday morning - That's dangerous levels for a baby and young children. The table next to us clearly had a lot to drink and were up dancing. So, bottom line, if you want a nightclub atmosphere for a weekend breakfast, this is your place. I wish this place the best, but not sure I want to return if they truly can't turn music down- that's ridiculous. Many families around here like to go out for breakfast on the weekends - this place clearly is not geared for families.",

Our server came to introduce herself and took our drink order very quickly. We ordered the cannoli pancakes, breakfast burrito, veggie scramble and bacon board, and everything was tasty and flavorful! We also got the mimosa flight and a bloody mary, but not the bloody mary bar, next time for sure! The service here was definitely one of the highlights of the meal, the manager, Domenic, came over twice to check on us and he was very friendly and engaging! Would definitely recommend this place!",

    "text": "Absolutely love this place! Went for the second time since they opened to close out my birthday weekend... and it was a blast   Our wait for two people was approximately 20 minutes (and the crowd was building up @ 9am).  When we got to our table our waitress Kim was wonderful and very sociable. Dom the manager is also fantastic, he stopped by our table a few times to make sure we were being taken care of. Customer service is so important and I believe that Hash Kitchen makes it a priority! Love the DJ music, some folks may not be into it and that's cool, for me I thought it was fun and really enjoyed it.  So, moving onto the drinks and food... We ordered the Cereal Flight as I was intrigued by the concept (who doesn't love cereal milk after its soaked up all the fun flavors: Fruit Loops, Cinnamon Toast, Coco Pebbles & Captain Crunch ). Although the drink tasted good I felt like I needed a little more of the cereal flavors and Kim was very accommodating by bringing me small bowls of each flavor to crunch on. For the main dish, I ordered the Smoked Salmon Frittata and substituted with egg whites and it was delicious! We then  decided that it was time for Mimosas and ordered the flight. This too was great, the glasses were larger than the Cereal Flight and the flavors were good. Liked that they rotate flavors of Mimosas (today's flavors were Blackberry, Kiwi, Strawberry and of course the Classic) all were yummy!  Hey did I mention it was my birthday? Breakfast ended with an Italian Donut with cannoli filling. Haven't had good cannoli in quite some time  so was happy with this sweet surprise!! I've read some of the other Yelp reviews and it's important to note that every place has opportunities and Hash Kitchen at this location has only been open for a month, so I would recommend giving it another try. Service, Food and Atmosphere is great, will definitely be back.",

We were greeted at the door, the hostesses and other employees all had the door opened for my boyfriend and I before we were even close to the door! Already a super warm welcoming. We were sat immediately and our server, Ryan, quickly came over and was the nicest person ever!! He went over a lot of the drinks with us, gave us his opinions on them and was super friendly and informative! It took us a while to make up our mind cause the menu is full of tasty stuff but we finally did and both of our meals were phenomenal! I headed over to the build your own bloody bar as soon as I placed my order and both bartenders were so awesome with helping me build my Bloody and were also recommending what was good! They even let me taste a mix! So above and beyond! Our food came out suuuuper quickly! Dominic, the manager, continuously checked up on us to make sure everything was great. He was very personable and nice! Our server was absolutely fantastic and continued to check up on us as well. It seemed like every server in there was our server because no matter what section they had, almost every single one of them offered us things and talked to us. One of my boyfriends drinks were made wrong, he didn't even know though because it was SO GOOD! And when the bartender realized he walked on over with a brand new one and he was able to keep his old one. Which they were both great drinks so it didn't even matter!! Overall this place is incredibly friendly, warm, tasty, and has the best customer service over any restaurant I've been to in arizona. Or anywhere really!!! Absolutely fantastic and we will be back!! Thank you Ryan and Dominic for making the experience great! :)",

We were hungry and she mentioned a newly opened spot she wanted to try...enter Hash Kitchen. For only being open a few weeks this place is phenomenal. We decided to sit outside as the wait was a bit long for inside seating (but this is normal for AZ and is in no way a complaint). The misting system made i bearable. We were seated as soon as we walked in, we had water and drinks at the same time the menu's were presented. We ordered the Lump crab and sweet potato hash and it was big enough for 2 people to eat...Mind you it took us 7 minutes from when we place our order to when the food was on the table (yes i timed it). I eyed every other meal that was brought to the tables around us... and made the comment \"I wish i would have ordered that\". We enjoyed this so much we actually arrived home from out ride and grabbed out younger kids and took them there for breakfast along with a few friends that also loved it. Needless to say we will be return customers and it'll even be better sitting outside once the fans and shades are installed. Dominic checked up on us even before we had our food and came back after to ensure everything was up to par and it was. This will be our go to spot after our weekend rides.",

It was the best however out of them all. Next time I would love to try out the make your own bloody Mary! On to the food. The corned beef hash was delicious, the egg cooked to perfection. I wish the potato to corned beef ratio was a little better.  OMGEEEE, their biscuits! At first glance I thought it was a roll...it was fluffy and flavorful with a nice crispy outer shell!! Hubby had the Monte Cristo; after finishing half of the plate he discovered a pineapple slice in the sandwich...props for getting my husband to eat fruit as he is usually not a fan. The French fries were on point. Crisp and fluffy...seasoned perfectly. It is a tad pricey, but understandable...",

We had a little wait to be seated, but not too long. On the weekends, they have a DJ spinning tunes. The Bloody Mary bar seemed to be very unusual and very popular. Our server was very pleasant and accommodating. Our food arrived promptly and was DELICIOUS...looking and tasting! My husband had a breakfast burrito stuffed with egg, potato, steak, bacon, onion and peppers. My dish was a sweet treat. It was called \"banana split brioche French toast\". It was topped with caramelized bananas, blueberries and strawberries along with an ice  ream cone shell filled with vanilla mascarpone. As if all of that wasn't enough, the maitre 'd, Dominic stopped by our table to chat and make sure \"everything was okay\".  It was a very nice and thoughtful gesture . He made me feel that as a customer, I mattered. WE will be going back. There are too made things on the Hash Kitchen menu that I want to try!",

Had to ask for a tortilla to eat it & add hot sauce, so bland. My husband had the biscuits and gravy which i liked but again lacked flavor. Needed spice, biscuits tasted fresh by hard to cut open. Maybe worth a second try but overall a miss with flavors.",

You can stop at the bar.  After all, that is what makes this experience so unique.  Well worth the wait.  They have a Bloody Mary bar, that I should have taken a picture of, but you can see our finished products.  It has basically anything and everything you could want to put in it.  Start by picking your salt; celery or bacon.  Bacon, duh!   Then pick your mix, al the way up to burning off taste buds.  Then the fixings.  Too many to list but included: slim Jim, pickled boiled eggs, different flavored pickles, cheese stuffed olives, meatballs, bacon slices, and my FAV jalapeno poppers.  They have more specialty drinks worth noting.  I saw one with cotton candy and a spinner in it.  They also do flights of mimosas in six fruity flavors.  They have a DJ on weekends.  Despite this place being slammed packed and really loud, the staff is so upbeat and friendly.  Jesus, was our waiter.  Polite, makes great recommendations, attentive and made for a great visit.  Dominic the manager is seen floating around.  Stopped and chatted with us.  See the pic!  You can always tell how management is running a business by the way the staff treats the customer.

    "text": "Came here for brunch around 10:20am and was told we had a 45 min wait - we got seated around 11am so estimation was pretty accurate. We got seated outside but the misters and fans helped with the heat and there was plenty of shade. This is the second time I've had Hash Kitchen and enjoy many of their dishes. We started with the donut cannoli to share - which cans with a cute wooden board of three. The sweetness of the cream was perfect and not too sweet, and definitely enhances the taste of the donut itself. We also each got juices for brunch and one mimosa flight. The orange juice was good, pineapple juice tasted not freshly made, and the grapefruit was good too. The mimosa flight had: orange, pineapple, strawberry and blueberry - the alcohol in the blueberry one was strongest. Their fruits are also seasonal so it changes depending on the fruit's season.   For the entree: - Fried Chicken Benedict: the chicken flavor was all there and not dry. The hollandaise sauce really brought together all the flavors and the buttered bread underneath was delicious on its own! The crispy onion bits sprinkled all over was one of the best things to top off this dish. - Carnitas Hash: flavor of the pork was on point. Lots of corn and potatoes mixed in with it. And you get a large scoop of avocado and tortillas on the side - yum! - Frittatas: made with lots of eggs and cake with tortillas on the side. This dish was very generous and good, but not my favorite out of the four we had. - Tamales Benedict: this tasted good and surprisingly went well with the Benedict and tamales combo. Worth trying!  Total was 109 without tips for the meal, which is an average price. Would recommend and return. However, we were disappointed in our food service when we ordered before most tables around us and they got their meals before us :/ not sure how that works but took us 40 minutes before we got food served. Otherwise the place is good and has an awesome DIY Bloody Mary bar for those into it. Lots of parking in the lot and free water while you wait through the hot weather.",

So simple yet so full of flavor. The manager, Domenic, was very welcoming. He came by after to check on our experience and chatted with us for some time. Nice and entertaining guy! I love feeling like a guest more than a customer and he sure made my group feel that way. The only reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is because both times that I have been here the service has been extremely slow. The server took our order and then didn't return until our food was finished. I ended up having to ask the host for extra things that we needed during our meal - like another drink. Also - both times I have been here my mimosa has taken forever to get to my table. My food actually got to the table at the same time as my drink did the last time I was there. It's hot in Arizona so the drinks should be coming out faster than that! But anyways- if you don't mind the slow service, then everything else is a go from me!",

I know it's supposed to be a place you go to keep the party going after you've been out all night, but by that time I usually have a headache. If I'm going there after I've slept all night, then I'd like to finish my breakfast and still be headache-free... but it's SO LOUD I usually leave with a throbbing head. I keep going back because the food is so good, but I wish they had a quieter area to sit.",

I tried the biscuit and gravy and was shocked how much flavor it had. Very Good!!!! I did try this place on the weekend before and it was way to packed. 1.5 hour wait. Which sucks because I probably won't eat here much since weekends are better for me. But this one time I did (on a Monday)it met my expectations.",

The ambient noise was very loud which makes having a conversation difficult, but this is probably fine for people who love to bury their nose in their cellphones instead of talking.  My husband had the huevos rancheros which he really liked.  I had the make your own scrambler, which was okay but the kitchen forgot the avocado.  The Bloody Mary bar looked interesting.  You could make a meal out of everything they offer, as long as you aren't looking for anything very healthy.  I can see why this is a big attraction.  I probably won't go back since I don't like eating breakfast or lunch in a nightclub atmosphere, want something more relaxing.",

I've been to all the locations except the Arcadia one.   They all leave me craving something more. The food is truly lack luster. The portions are large, I repeat LARGE. which is very nice, honestly you can split most of the dishes, but nothing on menu is ever \"wow I can't wait to eat this again\". I normally will eat here for the atmosphere and drinks  the food feels like an after thought. I do recommend giving it a shot! If your going Saturday or Sunday be prepared to wait an hour unless your very early or very late.",

    "text": "Finally got to try this place after a couple times trying to come here, I got to say I was a bit disappointed. I don't think it lived up to the hype that everyone has put on it, we waited for a bit which seemed normal as every time we drive by there's a huge line. Which doesn't really effect my opinion, just an observation if you're trying to time your events.   We walked inside and there was a DJ playing music, which we thought was a bit odd as he was just standing there swaying and it was Sunday morning.   We came here with a group of people, about 7 or 8, and we were kind of squished together into a booth with a chair on the end. Our waitress was nice enough but was a bit rude at times. She brought our menus and gave us adequate time to review, I can really only speak on behalf  of my dish and my husbands, I was not impressed with mine. I got the chicken and waffles and was surprised at how plain and bland the chicken was. I enjoyed the light fry of it but it didn't taste like I thought it would, especially seeing other dishes going out that looked AMAZING. I was honestly bummed, the waffle was fine but I wasn't given enough syrup for my dish - in the phot it looks huge but it's about 2 tablespoons if tha, but the waitress took too long to check in on us I just used what I had.   My husband dish was pretty good, such a good idea for the tamales and pulled pork. It was truly a hit or miss for me, disappointed. Everyone's experience is though.",

Our bartender was awesome and attentive and bloody Mary's are amazing but here comes the big but.... i guess if you are looking for a super LOUD I mean we are talking even on a Friday morning at 10am they have a DJ playing music like you are in a nightclub working the tables, (which yes they actually do!) then this is the place for you. But I couldn't even hear myself think. I def. can see the appeal for younger folks wanting a cool hangout but I could never imagine coming here hung over or even with the smallest of headaches or kids.   Ok food: Chicken Tinga frittata $15- was pretty good (but I had to wait for it to be remade unfortunately as I had requested it without the caramelized onions and there was a lot on there), enough food for 3 people - had to have been made with at least 10 eggs if not more! I mean their portions here are HUGE! Split your meals people- they def. don't skimp on their food!   2 people- 2 bloody Mary's and 2 breakfasts = $72. (Including tip and tax)  All in all- it was a eh experience since I received my meal 15 mins after my husband.   I can see how people celebrating parties or groups hanging out could enjoy this place for sure though.",

We always order the mimosa flight and the French Toast. The mimosa flight is awesome because you get to sample different juices and you honestly can't go wrong with any of the French Toast options. We also ordered the Chicken Tinga and it was simply okay. I would expect a lot more flavors with the chipotle, green salsa, shishito peppers, sour cream, avocado, and cotija cheese but it fell a bit short on the SAZON (which I totally get, we don't want to make chicken tinga too spicy there). Overall, Hash is still our favorite brunch spot in AZ hands down.",

There was a Bloody Mary bar, a disco ball and a LIVE DJ! Did I mention it was only about noon?!   First off, the menu is pretty big, and EVERYTHING sounds yummy on there! We couldn't make up our minds, so we ordered 3 things... yes, just 2 of us. Chicken tinga, Avocado Toast, and Coconut and Almond encrusted french toast for the sweet tooth. The tinga came with potatoes and the egg was so dense - how come mine never turn out like that?!   Honestly the most outstanding and gustatory delight was the Avocado toast. They were large and heavy, layer after layer of goodness... I didn't want to miss out on any aspect of the toast, so I picked up a slice, opened wide and took a huge bite. It was messy and a little embarrassing (had I cared about what others may have thought), but good golly, that was the best mouthful of anything I've ever had! The girls sitting next to me giggled at me, but I didn't care... they were envious - in a good way, because they ordered the same thing and these prim and perfectly made up girls did the exact same thing I did when their Avocado toast got to them. We shared an inexplicable understanding at that point.   GO TO HASH KITCHEN! Order literally ANYTHING! You won't be disappointed!",

The vibe just checking in for the waitlist is pretty cool, everyone inside talking having fun, enjoying the company and food plus there's a DJ. That was a great add it makes it feel like your in Vegas.  Right when you walk in to the right is this amazing Bloody Mary bar that you can add everything too. There is some upgrades you can do with a charge but they will tell you before you order.  There's no limit to what you can add to yours so be creative and have fun with it.  Oh ya and there's a mimosa flight that we of course couldn't pass on   The waitress we had was friendly and helpful just like everyone else there.  Now the food is ridiculous from what we ordered. I think our eyes were bigger then our bellies.  We got the brunch fries, the avocado toast and the lemon meringue French toast.  Holy call what flavors what taste and what big size portions the food was.   We were not disappointed here.   This is a place we will come back to and am excited to come try more food.",

    "text": "I was looking for a great breakfast / brunch place to go. I came across this gem (thanks to yelp) with a unique, eye catching killer menu. This location is a newer breakfast/brunch restaurant that's been in Chandler for about a year ( in July). They've originated in AZ with additional spots in Scottsdale, Glendale and opening another location in Arcadia soon!  Line was out the door Saturday morning about 10:00 AM when we arrived. Noted that the immediate feel of the hashery is a trendy plush place with exceptional offerings. When you walk into the restaurant you'll view their DIY Bloody Mary Bar & the live DJ too! Let's just start out by saying this is raising the game in Chandler!   We were seated \"right away\", after we went with \"no preference\"! However, we were sat outside with no shade ( in the direct sun) and to many flies. So, a place at the bar opened up and we moved over there!   They have a Bloody Mary Bar that's staffed and it provides many different Vodkas - several were house infused; everything from Bacon Vodka to Habanero Vodka. Then there were the mixers and they ranged from Classic Bloody Mary Mix to Mixed Chili Mix; along with a choice of rim salts - bacon or traditional. Then it gets interesting with all of the add ins you care to add in - Hearts of Palm, Lots of Pickles and Olives to choose from, bacon, beef jerky, Slim Jim's, fresh raw oysters, cheeses, and on and on. My Spicy Mary with Hearts of Palm, bacon, dill pickle spear and olives was truly one of the best Bloody Mary's I've had. They also have a flight of their signature mimosa.  So much to choose from on their menu The plates I saw coming out? \"Holly Cow\", the Chicken & Waffles looked incredible! I had a really hard time deciding so I ask the bartender for recommendations. She suggested many things, but did say that the Cliliquiles is a popular item. That's what I \"originally\" looked at, so went with it -YUM! It includes two eggs ( anyway you'd like um) with a red enchilada sauce and I also requested a side of the green chili too! My husband had the carne asada breakfast dish with two eggs over easy with house potatoes and tortillas. He really enjoy it. The meat was flavorful and tender. *The only downside for us both: we didn't care for one spice in the potatoes. It seemed to be a dry ( woody) rosemarie. I like the spice, but didn't care for it in this potato hash. Fresh would have been better or just omit it!*  We have guests coming to visit soon and you can bet where we will be having brunch one of those days!   GREAT Concept, GREAT Atmosphere & GREAT Customer Service. The female bartenders & bar back guy were extremely friendly, yet also very informative and attentive.",

We brought our pup for the his first outing and everyone was so nice and friendly with us and our dog. They provide a water bowl for him which is great especially in this AZ heat.  I ordered the chicken tinga not have favorite, however I will order something else next time I come.  The chicken was dry and chewy the bed of egg it was laying out didn't have much flavor, the hash browns that come on the side were dry and cold.   My fiance got the chicken and waffles and said it was very good.   So I believe it was just the thing I ordered. I don't take it out on anyone or the business it just might be my test.   I enjoyed the music and Bloody Marys!   Domenic was very nice and continued to check on us and our food. He was polite and showed he truly cares about the business and their customers.",

    "text": "We stopped in to Hash Kitchen around 7:30 for an early breakfast with the kids. We were seated quickly and  the host brought us a high chair.   I was a little disappointed with the vegetarian options. There are, of course, all the French toast, pancakes, and waffles and two egg dishes. I would really like to see a veggie Benedict, aside from being my go to at most breakfast places, it would just be nice to see the same creative flourishes elsewhere on the menu applied to the veggie options.  We decided on the Banana Split French Toast, the Sicilian Sausage Hash, and the Short Stack Chocolate chip pancakes. I really loved the French toast. It looked like it should have been sugar overload, but because of the thickness of the bread. That sweet marscapone was delicious even if it didn't resemble marscapone all that much. The ice cream cone was overkill--I gave it to my kid. We were all pretty happy with our food.  It was 7 AM, so we weren't drinking yet (it wasn't stopping anyone else), but the Bloody Mary bar looked amazing. There was also some kind of disco ball drink (I think it was the Lights Out Mimosa) that looked fairly insane. We'll have to try the booze out another day.  The service was okay, though we did sit for a while before anyone came to take our drink order. I think our server was just trying to let us get the kids settled.   We'll be back. Hopefully a little later in the day:)",

    "text": "The space is huge with plenty of tables plus seats at the bar and seating outside. The large windows let in a ton of light and the restaurant has a nice open feel to it. Bloody mary bar right as you walk in. I don't drink bloody mary's but this is genius! I would want a bigger glass to put all the goodies in if I was getting one though (it comes in a small mason jar glass).  The DJ is right in between the bar and bloody mary bar. It was a bit loud when we walked in especially with all the crowd chatter but it seemed to turn down a bit and was just right as we settled in. I'm not going to ever complain with a DJ spinning classic 80s hits and all the jams from the 90s, 00s to today. I will take a live DJ over pandora station any day. I'm in heaven and singing every word...makes me just want to get up and dance. Way to put me in a great mood to start my day ...thanks DJ C-Los!!  We only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. It's 1030am on a friday and the place is still packed! We are on vacation so it's understandable why we are there, but I am impressed with how busy it is on a weekday (do you all have off today?) Glad we checked it out today so we dont have to fight the weekend crowds, but it is worth it if you do have to wait. When we sat down I was most excited about the size of the mug on the table. I love big mugs and to get one at a restaurant with breakfast is rare for me. So I was stoked to get a nice hot tea with my meal and I was even more excited when it was served with my very own hot water pot. Bonus points for also having individual carafes for the coffee!! And no, it's not an excuse for the server to be lazy and not have to refill our cups...Angelina checked in on us frequently and filled up our waters and made sure we were satisfied with our meals multiple times. She was fantastic. With how busy it is, it would be really easy to get ignored after the food comes but that wasn't the case at all and she was amazing.   The food came out relatively quickly as well and it was nice and hot. My gut instinct was to say it was small portions for the price but I don't need massive portions and was pleased with how filling the food was. I got the veggie scramble. The eggs were airy and cooked thoroughly and the veggies were fresh and crisp. The hash potatoes were so aromatic I could smell them as soon as the plate was delivered. Loved the seasoning and how crisp they were on the outside with a nice soft center.  Hubby got the biscuits & gravy with Italian sausage and he took a bite and says holy sh*t that's good. The sausage was a little over cooked but the skillet was an awesome way to serve the dish and keep it all hot. Biscuits were light and fluffy, savory and slightly sweet and the eggs were cooked to perfection.   The snap a selfie station by the front door is such a cute touch and great idea to spread the word on social media about this hot spot and keep the millennials entertained while they wait to be seated ;)  At the end of our meal she offers us to go cups for our hot drinks. Hell yea that was the icing on the cake.  I didn't want to keep a table occupied to just drink my tea, so being able to take it to go and enjoy every last drop was sweet!! So glad we found this spot while in town visiting for the weekend!!",

    "text": "Hash Kitchen is unique and so much fun! I mostly come for the Bloody bar and mimosa flights, but having a DJ spin while you eat brunch is hard to beat too.   We come about once a month, and have found that if we stick to a few staples, everything is perfect. Some of the food is honestly just so-so, and it's kinda pricey. On the plus side, portions are large and it's easy to share anything. We're big fans of the avocado toast and the biscuits and gravy. Far from healthy, but worth the splurge! We've tried some of the skillet dishes and while none have been bad, they're simply not memorable. The ambiance is extremely memorable, so that just doesn't jive. Also, you can't come here without getting a Bloody (be sure to check out the hot chafing dishes at the very end...bacon, meatballs, and jalapeno poppers!) or a mimosa flight!  Be prepared to wait on weekends, but we usually put our names in, order a Bloody, and then manage to snag a spot at the bar within 15-20 minutes. Oh, and come ready to dance!",

I was seated immediately but waited several mins for my server, Gabriel, to greet me. He generally ignored me during the entire meal.   I ordered the Corned Beef Benedict for $16.22 plus tip. My breakfast arrived in 8 mins.   The corned beef was rather dry, especially since there was very little hollandaise, and the biscuit was very ordinary. The eggs were woefully over cooked.  The hash potatoes were actually skillet potatoes with onions and bell peppers, served in a little bowl.   The meal was conceptually great. The execution was poor, due to the dryness of the meat, the potatoes and the over cooked eggs.   Service was minimal, the flavor was lacking and the value just wasn't there. I really wanted to like Hash, given the reviews. I'll try again, with a different server and definitely a different meal.",

Upon arrivalI was greeted by friendly staff and a beautiful restaurant ambience. It was very early in the morning yet the location had already had plenty of customers.  After waiting for about 10 minutes, I was seated. Looking over the menu options, I noticed there were so many things to choose from that I really had a hard time choosing.  My lovely waitress, who I had forgotten her name was very helpful with choosing something that was appeasing to the eye and stomach. I ended up going with the French toast, and I added bacon, and Homestyle potatoes. This was such a delicious meal.  At first, I thought it was gonna be too sweet, but everything complemented each other from the Waffle cone, syrup,  fruit, and the banana and a delicious cream that was on top. I was really ecstatic to have tried this particular menu choice item and I actually recommend it as a favorite.  Leaving the location,  I felt not only satisfied with the menu choice of item, but grateful that I had a chance to experience the Hash Kitchen! For a person who travels a lot, I will have to mark this location as one of my favorites for brunch.",

My husband had the chilaquiles and they were tasty.  My mother in law had the tamales Benedict and really liked it. We order a half order of regular French toast which was amazing! And a gluten free pancake which was also very good!   I would say the carnitas hash and French toast was the best!   The manager, Domenic, came to greet us and check on how the service was and we let him know that service was fast and great! Our server Jesus was very polite, knowledgeable and provided excellent service and suggestions.    We will definitely come back and try out their new restaurant Sicilian Butcher!",

Management has the right amount of staff every single time am there, you never have to wait for anything, you never have to wave someone down and everyone works together to make the customer happy.  Food and drink presentation is out of this world. Over-the-top care goes into every single plate that leaves that kitchen. The drinks are fresh, fun and super creative.   The personal attention I receive every time I am there is so welcoming. Dominic is such a people pleaser, he makes sure everyone is personally welcomed, thanked and appreciated.

Eventually the manager told us that the party at the table we had reserved was taking longer than expected, and that they would buy us a drink for the inconvenience.  We left at 11:30 and went to a different restaurant.    Reservations are pretty basic and have been a part of the food service industry for a long time, pretty hard to screw that one up...

I even got treated to a birthday cannoli but I'll be honest, no pictures of that because I immediately ate the donut hole right off the top. December was a wonderful server as well. I also interacted with Lauren Kirk via email & she was helpful & very responsive. Everything just seemed to go well. I wanted to have everyone together on a beautiful Saturday morning enjoying a great experience together & that's what we had. Food was yummy. Brioche was HUGE!!!! Loved my Carnitas Hash.

But when we came in it was super packed which made it loud and then there was a live DJ which just added to how loud it was, it kinda felt more like a club than a brunch spot. The food wasn't super great, but I think their drinks are more their thing. But if a hip atmosphere and brunch mimosas are your thing you love this place, personally it wasn't for me but if you like a party, or girls day this place will be great for you!",

DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON THE BLOODY MARY BAR! I am a huge Bloody Mary fan and the idea of allowing your customers to customize their drink is absolutely genius, and I wish someone made this in LA !!! The service was absolutely amazing ! To tell you the least I dropped my knife and immediately I had a server pick it up and bring me a new one. Lastly Dominic came up to our table and made sure everything was running smoothly and he was very outgoing and friendly and pleasant to speak to. I'll definitely be back next time I visit",

    "text": "I've been looking forward to this grand opening for quite some time. In fact, I had the honor of being the first patron to sit at the bar. The Hash Kitchen is co-owned by chef Joey Maggiore and his wife Cristina Maggiore of Maggiore Culinary Concepts (who also own Tomaso's Italian Restaurant and Tommy V's Osteria Pizzeria). They are known for their crazy breakfast creations. This is the first location for the East Valley and they picked a pretty strategic spot next to Whole Foods and the 101 freeway. The spot was once a Paradise Bakery. The atmosphere was very inviting right when I first walked in as several people welcomed me. The restaurant is spacious and the decor is beautiful with their signature #Hash #Hash Baby signage all over the walls. Their popular build-your-own Bloody Mary bar with their many garnishes and bacon-infused vodka is the first thing you see as you walk in. I even saw oysters as a choice for your garnish. I sat at the bar and had fun chatting it up with the bartenders. I have yet to indulge in the Bloody Mary bar, but I did order one of their delicious blueberry craft mimosas with my meal (you can order a flight of mimosas as they have many flavors to choose from). I tried the Christina's Tamale Cakes for my meal. It's a form of an egg's benedict that combines sweet corn cakes, green chili pork, hollandaise and poached eggs. They come served on corn husks and I really enjoyed the spiciness of the pork with the sweet corn cakes. I wasn't a huge fan of the hash potatoes (a little dry) but the split biscuit was a pleasant surprise. Overall this was a nice experience and I'm super stoked to have a Hash Kitchen down the street. Hopefully my next visit will include a visit to the Bloody Mary bar.",

My boyfriend had the poutine corn beef hash and I had the cannoli pancakes and a Bloody Mary. The food was good however, my boyfriend was almost finished with his meal before she came to check on us and I needed syrup before I could eat my meal. Our server wasn't very friendly and seemed to only be checking on the tables surrounding us and kept skipping over us. After I requested the syrup, it took quiet some time to receive that too and by the time it was all said and done, I was over it and didn't even feel like eating my food. I'm not sure if she wasn't checking on us because we are younger and thought we wouldn't tip well but I'm a server and a bartender and if she would have served us properly, she would have had a great tip from me. Not sure if we will come back here again. Very disappointed.",

Two things that sets this place apart, the massive Bloody Mary bar and other breakfast cocktail items and the live DJ.  I found it a little overwhelming and extreme for the brunch I was looking for that day with my mom.  I really appreciated the server that we had, who was very personable and attentive even though they were extremely busy. I had the pork hash and thought it was very tasty. I could not finish it all. My mom and husband also bought their food was tasty. I was unimpressed by the coffee. It was not very strong. Overall, I thought the food was good but a little over priced, but undoubtably, you are paying for the environment you are eating in.  I personally will not go back unless I am planning to be with a big group of people and am in the mood for some Bloody Mary's but am sure it is a fun place to go for the right group of people!",

Hubby had the Avocado Toast. This was also super yummy. They serve it with a green sauce on the side. Use it! It tastes amazing!

As others have said, it can get very loud inside due to the DJ, especially if the tables are filled. Expect a wait even during the week during brunch times- otherwise weekdays after 12:30ish is less busy.  The food is fantastic, the service wonderful. The dishes are unique, and of grand size- often I have not been able to finish the whole plate. This is a great place to take your kids because you won't care if they are being loud.",

Mgr Dominic chanced upon me as I went to check out the patio scene in 100 degree weather, but too hot and humid for a toddler and infant ... he tried to scope out a shady spot for us then intro'd himself as the mgr, good energy and super kind.

We kept seeing the specialty pancakes being brought to other tables....which we'll prob try at another time. We will def be back!

The place was only about 25% full so we asked the hostess to seat us in the quietist part of the restaurant...her response was \"the volume of the music is the same wherever you sit\". We spotted a corner table in the back of the place which was probably a bit more quiet. The waitress wasn't very welcoming but took our order which came out rather quickly. The lemon ricotta pancakes were dry and a bit chewy, with only a hint of lemon taste. Note: I've had Lemon Ricotta pancakes at another popular breakfast/lunch restaurant that were served with lemon curd and actual ricotta cheese - so yummy! The vegetarian scramble was tasty but the hash browns were dry and a bit hard, as if they had been left over and sitting for a while. 'not sure we'll give this place another try.",

My expectations of the Bloody Mary bar drastically declined as I could not even figure out how to get the bar items on the stick, so good luck to everyone out there. I would give this luxury 2 stars. The food menu items weren't bad, however the portions are either small or can feed a family of 5. You don't really know what it will be until it hits the table, food gets 4 stars. Overall the food was all good. Prices can be a smidge lower. $55 for breakfast without the drinks for two people is not really ideal unless you're in a resort.",

Was I going to the club or brunch??  Lol. We got sat in maybe 25 mins. We were busy talking so it didn't seem so bad. Wow the menu! Too many great choices and I kept changing my mind. The big start was the huge Bloody Mary bar. If I drank I would be all over that.  Service was great considering how packed it was. Food was tasty. Definitely will go back. Just not at 10 am on a Sunday. ;)",

The s'mores pancakes had one chocolate chip in all of 3 pancakes & hardly any marshmallow cream. The breakfast potatoes were bland and the pancakes itself were pretty dry. It was doable but I wouldn't come back or recommend it to anyone. Our waitress also seemed to rush us and showed no patience or interest in helping us. I feel that this place has potential.",

We came in for brunch on Sunday morning and before 9 am a DJ was playing club music at decibels heard in a club. This alone would be a reason for me to not return add to this the high prices and poorly executed dishes.   I ordered the herb fried chicken benedict, it arrived and looked great upon tasing my chicken was room temp and did not taste of any herb, the best thing about the whole dish was the biscuits.  This place is definitely trying to put out the \"scene\" vibe and while the Bloody Mary bar may pull people in I suspect the high prices and lackluster entrees will prohibit them from returning.",

    "text": "We hadn't been to the Hash Kitchen for quite awhile so thought we'd go there today. I recently had a delicious Wild Salmon Omelet with Mascarpone at Eggstasy for $12.95 this past week. So when I saw the Spinach Smoked Salmon with Dill Mascarpone Frittata on their menu, I immediately wanted to try it and share it with my husband. When the food finally arrived, it looked like it was mostly spinach and very little salmon for $16! We got a little tin 3/4 cup with the tiniest overcooked potatoes I've ever seen. Couldn't even pick them up with your fork. We had to order an English muffin extra on the side! Like for $16 they couldn't include a 50 cent English muffin at their cost if even that! The frittata had VERY LITTLE salmon in it and when I looked, there was dark meat underneath the salmon. This was not acceptable for $16! In my husband's half, he had two tiny bites of salmon and the rest was spinach! If we would have wanted a SPINACH frittata, that's what we would have ordered! The salmon omelet at Eggstasy was FULL OF SOLID SALMON WITHOUT ANY DARK MEAT and we got half a plate full of hash browns or fruit, as well as, pancakes or toast for $12.95! Gave Hash Kitchen a second chance after 6 months and we'll cross this place entirely off of our breakfast schedule. Our waitress kept disappearing and when she did walk by our table, she looked straight ahead. We tried to get her attention about 3-4 times unsuccessfully. I had to repeatedly flag down other waiters to get more coffee, cream, and order our English muffin before our meal got cold. Not at all impressed. The main attraction here is their Bloody Mary bar. There were tons of empty tables at 9:00 AM when we left. Typically at that time, there's standing room only at Chandler breakfast restaurants. For a wonderful dining experience, good food at a better price, great Italian coffee and excellent service, go to Eggstasy on Gilbert Road south of Germann!",

Like most breakfast, lunch (brunch) places, this place gets busy...but many others had from the run had the same idea as us...so the wait was a little bit longer than the normal crowd.  Once we were seated we were greeted by our waitress immediately who took our drink order.  Many of us order the Build Your Own Bloody Mary (BYOBM) bar which was amazing.  So many items to garnish your drink and \"make it your own.\"  I opted for the Corned beef Hash breakfast which came with homestyle potatoes as well.  It was presented in a skillet that was still very hot.  Everything was cooked to perfection and seasoned well.  My bloody mary base was green chili habenero, which was seasoned well, but lacked in spicy heat, for me.  Others may say it is a 5 chili rating, but me it was more like a 1 chili rating...but I like hot and won't & can't hold it against them; because it was tasty.  I would definitely come back again try other items on their menu as well as other bloody mary bases.",

Half of us went with the hashes and were disappointed when 80% of the entree was potatoes, and the rest being the meat and eggs. With such a premium price for breakfast I was definitely expecting more. The server was friendly but her attentiveness was pathetic, we were waiting on syrup for the pancakes for about 10 minutes, by the time my friend got her syrup her pancakes were soggy with the melted s'mores on them. Lastly, when the food was delivered it was like a minute between each entree was dropped leaving that awkwardness where everyone is waiting for the rest of the food to be delivered but wanting to eat their food while it's hot. You can do so much better in terms of breakfast/brunch places for half the price.",

    "text": "We just flew in to AZ and needed some breakfast before running around town for two days.  Plane landed at 7.30a, I scoured yelp for a nice breakfast place nearby my in-laws' house while my hubs managed car rental and luggage (aka all the hard work), we were seated at Hash by 8.30a.  It wasn't super crowded for a Friday morning but there was a ton of staff. There's nothing wrong with that, just an observation. I assume they were ready for a busy weekend brunch crowd.   They had a bloody mary bar that looked like it offered every option you could ever think of. I'm not a fan of bloody mary's, so I didn't bother to look but I know that's their selling point and they def made sure you knew it!  The place itself was super cute and clean. Tons of seating. Staff was extra friendly.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong things but I'm not dying to go back to try anything new. I ordered the bacon tray thing and my husband ordered some sort of cornbread hash. It was all GOOD but not great. It was a little too much flavor going on for my liking. The bacon had four different kinds of bacon - Jalapeno, black pepper, maple, and bacon jam. It came with cheese and some rolls. I am a MAJOR bacon fan and there was not one of those that I would order again. The has my husband got was delicious but there was SO MUCH going on. I cannot for the life of me remember which hash it was or what was in it. I couldn't comprehend the amount of things thrown in there, I guess. The fried leeks that they use as garnish and the coffee (nothing special, just coffee) were prob my fave part of the entire meal.  They did make gluten free pancakes for us! so...there's something!  It seemed a little pricey for Arizona. $14-ish/meal.",

I called from the parking lot to see how long the wait was so I didn't have to get the kids out of the car if it was ridiculously long and it wasn't too bad. 15 minutes for inside, no wait for the patio. I told the hostess that we were calling from the parking lot and by the time we got in she already had our table on the patio ready. I had the mega mimosa since it was my birthday - fantastic! The strawberry boba bursts were so much fun! My husband had the cold brew colada and we split the carnitas hash and cannoli pancakes. Our kids split a side of toast, bacon and a short stack of pancakes. Everything was delicious and the service was fantastic. The food came out incredibly quickly and everyone was very attentive. The manager Domenic came by and had a great conversation with us. We are excited to try the Chandler location of the sister restaurant the Sicilian Butcher opening soon. We will be back to Hash Kitchen soon too!",

The hash potatoes were very run of the mill and needed more crispy texture and salt. My tamale Benedict was sickly sweet for some reason, like they put sugar in the masa. Kinda gross. Portion size a bit small too (very little of the pork). My friend said the eggs were also a bit dry/over cooked.   Overall it seems like people come here because of the Bloody Mary bar and loud music because otherwise the food needs a lot of work based on what we ordered.",

Another downside, I know it is common that restaurants are getting louder. This place was loud and they had a DJ in the morning. Not a great place to catch up with family.",

Watching people at the build-your-own Bloody Mary bar was really entertaining, as was the DJ (a DJ for breakfast?). Our food was excellent. It's a creative menu, classic breakfast food with a fun spin. We had French toast, carne asada, and a couple of BYO scrambles. The service was fast, efficient and friendly. We're visiting from Chicago and next time we're in Chandler we'll definitely be back. Well worth a trip!",

Waited an hour and half for not poached eggs but was too hungry to think straight to send it back to the kitchen. Also the cereal shooters were a disappointment. I thought it would be milkshake consistency but it's just blended up soggy cereal with alcohol.",

Even though the menus did say thick cut marble rye bread this was ridiculous.  I tried to cut one of the pieces in half which was a messy disaster. Too much cole slaw on top of the terrible corned beef and dried out Swiss cheese resulted in huge waste of $15.00.  The only good thing were the fries.  Never again.",

When we were first seated, it took over 5 minutes for someone to get us a water and 10 for our server to come to our table. Forgot her name but she had long blonde ish hair and tattoos. She was very helpful when ordering and a contagious smile. After we ordered, a random customer walked in and offered to take our picture as a family picture and was seated 8 tables down from us. We ordered at 2:04 (my family always times food because we go to a lot of restaurants) and at around 2:20 that same table got their food. At 2:25 we told our waitress and she apologized and OFFERED US to get the manager. She left and came back WITHOUT a manager but with the food. Then my dad asked her if the manager just didn't want to talk to us and she preceded to tell us how it was her fault and NEVER got the manager. She did nothing to take care of our bill or anything. The food was okay, nothing too exciting.  At the end of our meal we saw the manager next to our waitress and she STILL never told him to come to our table. How unprofessional and embarrassing. My dad then called the manager over and all he did was apologized and didn't offer to take care of anything. Everyone in my family works in a restaurant and our managers immediately take care of the bill. He was just as shocked to see that our food took 35 minutes. But did nothing. We weren't looking for getting our bill paid but the workers were just absolutely careless as well as the manager. When we said we won't return he just said \"oh okay.\" Please DO NOT come here!!",

I'm not a breakfast girl but when my husband read me the menu, I was excited to hear there are so many lunch items. We both ordered hash items- carne asada and carnitas. Both were great, both could have had less potatoes and more meat but the flavor, presentation and size were all good. The DJ was there and that was super fun and cool! The best part about the restaurant was meeting Dominic, the manager! He was so friendly and he seemed genuinely passionate about the restaurant and the family that owns Hash Kitchen. He gave us tips on the best time to come in on a Sunday, how to stack your Bloody Mary so it doesn't spill over and even gave us a heads up on the family's newest Italian restaurant Sicilian Butcher that will be opening soon in Chandler. Dominic has the perfect personality to be working at Hash Kitchen- fun, energetic, outgoing and seems to truly care about the diner's experience! Thank you Dominic, we will be definitely be back!",

The restaurant is a great size given its recent notoriety in the area and the wait staff work hard to keep the food coming out quickly.  The menu has a wide variety of different takes on usual breakfast items and the food is delicious.  There is a dj playing music on the weekends to entertain the crowd, but it does make for a little trouble talking across the table with your guests.  Parking is not easy and you should plan on dropping off your guests at the front door ahead of your seating time.  HK will definitely be a repeat place for us in the near future.",

I brought my cousin who was in town for the weekend and decided that this place would be the perfect welcome meal! Kendra served us and she was so awesome and got our order in quickly. Domenic came around and made sure we were taken care of and definitely went above and beyond. And to top it all off, the DJ's play an awesome mix. This place has the best vibe and is the perfect combo for DJ tunes and fantastic food & drinks. Chandler is lucky to have a spot like this!",

I was very surprised when we went to notice a DJ giving us some great music for this brunch of ours.  I also immediately noticed the bloody mary bar and the 50 or so options to put in your bloody mary beverage.  Our waitress was amazing; quick and stealth like but also extremely happy.  It only took about 15 minutes to get our food.  I ordered the banana split French toast and it was amazing.  The French toast was perfect and it seemed more like a dessert.  It had bananas and strawberries all over with an ice cream cone holding about a ton of sweet sweet butter.  I also ordered bacon and it was perfectly cooked; not too crisp.  The orange juice tasted like it was freshly squeezed but I couldn't verify it.  The bathrooms and restaurant was very clean.  They also have a outside dog friendly tables if you bring your favorite pooch.  I will definitely be back and next time I will partake in the bloody mary bar.",

The Bloody Mary Bar is delightful, although I do not drink Bloody Marys. Lol. The DJ was awesome. Reason for rating a 3 was due to the change in menu. The Lump Crab sweet potato dish was no longer listed on menu yet had excellent reviews.  The 4 flavored mimosas was not what I expected. They lacked flavor. My dish, beef hash was to die for!! It was a big portion. The server was really nice and very attentive.",

He also came over to check in more than once. The food was delicious and clearly very fresh. All in all, great.   I will be going again!",

Our server Jesus was awesome and the manager Domenic was amazingly attentive and super friendly. I had been wanting to try this place for months and it definately didnt disappoint.

( just note this is a breakfast, lunch, brunch place and you can get any of the items anytime of the day that  they're open. )Both times were great and seated right away. Next time I will try the Sunday brunch and bloody Mary bar which looks like a meal in itself. Just know in my opinion the portions are large and very shareable ,go hungry ,or if you like to take home -leftovers perfect choice.  The first time I dined there Dominic the manager came around and introduced himself and made sure everything was OK with our group. Today I had Dominic come over to the table so I could say hello to him and chat.  I appreciate a manager coming around even if just for a few minutes of their time -in my opinion it's great customer service and definitely makes me want to come back to a restaurant when I'm treated in that manner.   For breakfast I had the s'mores French toast and for lunch we had the Cubano sandwich and Salmon BLT which comes with a choice of fries or a green salad. We had the salad.The two dressing choices are ranch or balsamic vinegar .  Our server for lunch was Nicholas and he checked back on us a few times. At this restaurant there are food runners so your waiter or waitress may not bring you your food. Drinks were refilled in a timely manner .  I did not get any pictures of our food or the restaurant,but perhaps when I go for Sunday brunch I will add some photos. As others have said there is a patio and a pretty spacious dining room.  There are a mix of seating options. High tables that have a booth on 1 side and chairs on the other side- the chairs have backs, low tables and chairs, and  low tables that have booth style sitting on one side and chairs on the other. There are a few televisions and there is a bar area.   I have not experienced the entertainment on the weekends, but hopefully when I dine there for Sunday brunch the music isn't too loud. I appreciate a little entertainment music ,but usually when dining I like to chat with my table mates and have music as background.  Great neighborhood location that has opened up and great customer service by Dominic.",

    "text": "Have heard amazing things about Hash Kitchen, but when I tried it I wasn't that impressed. We came here during a week day around noon and it was relatively busy, but there was no wait. Me and my mom both ordered the Avocado Toast HASH style and it was gigantic! I was super excited about this as I have seen multiple pictures of this super delicious looking breakfast. Two thick slabs of brioche toast on a board loaded with yummy breakfast foods how could you go wrong? As I started to dig in I started having some problems. I first realized that they left off the pulled porked from my Toast, but my moms came out fine. I asked my server and she apologized and quickly brought out a side of pork for me to put on my toast. Another problem I had, but didn't say anything about is that I've seen from other people pictures that they get their avocado toast with two normal slices of bacon on each toast, but on mine I got 1 slice of bacon cut in half on one piece of toast and only half a slice of bacon on the other piece of toast? Also, even though there are other toppings, the lack of actual avocado on the toast was surprising, just thin layer seemly mixed with the bacon jam. I understand variation in orders, but with a missing ingredient , a scarce amount of another ingredient, and just the overall sloppy presentation that didn't appear to be the quality of food that others have received from this establishment. Despite the problems I had with the food I do have to admit it was very tasty so I will definitely be coming back and will hopefully have a better dining experience",

Between the 3 of us ordered the Avocado Toast, Banana Split French Toast & Biscuits and Gravy. We were all very impressed with the presentation and quality of each dish. As I mentioned,the portions are large and none of us finished everything. Service was perfect. No waiting around for someone to fill your water glass. Dom &  Amanda took good care of us. The vibe is hip with a DJ spinning tunes Fri - Sun. The music (80 decibels) is about 20 decibels too loud if you want to have a conversation w/o yelling. I look forward to coming back soon for a lunch to see if it is as amazing as breakfast.",

You're able to kill some of the wait time by partaking in the Bloody Mary bar ($12 for small and an extra $4 to use Tito's vodka over well) or getting a mimosa flight. The prices were a bit high if you ask me, but the food was good. My favorite item was the breakfast bruschetta board with three different flavors- all delicious! Unfortunately, my has was really dry and my eggs were over cooked. My husbands fruity pebble pancakes were visually pleasing and very dense/ filling so a 1/2 order was perfect. They offer a $25 \"bottle\" of champagne mimosa that's served with strawberry boba, a pinwheel, and cotton candy. However, I'm pretty sure there was maybe 1/2 bottle in there aka a TON of orange juice. I might go back if I had plenty of time to waste or a friend wanted to give it a shot, but it'll definitely be after the dust of their newness settles.",

The menu has a wide array of breakfast and lunch options for the child at heart, bruncher, or foodie complete with omnivore or vegetarian options for every one. I've not yet tried the Bloody Mary bar (always gone during work lunch break), but if it's anything like it looks, you're in for a treat! Dominic (on of the managers) is pretty awesome; he mingles through the guests and does more than the requisite \"how was every thing\" speech. He asks how you're doing, clears your table, and (most importantly) shakes your hand and talks to you like a person, not just a customer. I felt like I was in the Hash Kitchen inner circle! Go check them out, the food is great - the layout is awesome - and the staff are amazing and attentive!",

This oasis in the desert just opened mid July, and already boasts a packed house, with attentive and happy servers, mouth watering, artful displays of cuisine, and a flair of pizzaz in its' drink concoctions. I could hardly wait for the doors to open (pictures below) and when they did, it was worth the hour/s long wait for some, to experience the Hash Kitchen, which boasts the biggest Bloody Mary Bar in AZ.  Despite its daytime only hours, there's a DJ and a disco ball playing lively music. And for those who are waiting for a table, the inside/outside bar has cool air blowing, keeping the summer inferno heat at bay. Will and Toby are amazing bartenders, and their charm, skill, speed and hospitality make this my new neighborhood 'Cheers'. There wasn't a table when we arrived, so we chose to eat at the bar.  The outside seating area is also dog friendly, so I'll be bringing my Fido for a visit too!  I'm a vegetarian, so I ordered the Ricotta Lemon Pancakes. Absolutely delish and creative! For meat eaters, I can tell you the presentation of the food was outstanding, and the portions generous.  Hash Kitchen is such a great addition in Chandler. I just wish they were open evenings as well! Who doesn't like breakfast for dinner now and then?",

Various vodka flavors to choose from. If you are like me and like mimosas instead get the flight. Great flavors. Dominick is one of the managers and he was so nice. He came out to check on us and make sure everything was good. He told us about him and his family they just moved here from the East coast. It gave a nice touch of personalization and made us feel welcome. Bailey was our server. If was very busy when we arrived. She did a great job. I would definitely recommend checking this place out. If you have only gone to the Scottsdale location try this one out anyway. It is a different atmosphere and I enjoyed it more.",

The service has been top-notch and the manager has even stopped by a couple times to check in and make sure we were enjoying our visit. I think it was a Friday we were there and they had a DJ, but it wasn't overkill or too loud; it was fun.  We've been here 3 times now and I think my favorite is the lemon ricotta pancakes, which have a great \"balance\" of the flavors. The hashes were also good and the chilaquiles was amazing (but I'd like a little more chicken on there).  I don't like bloody mary's but my friends do and they highly recommend the bloody mary bar.  I hope they keep everything quality and it stays for a long time.",

We usually go on Sundays and they have a live Dj playing great music ranging from country to hip hop to oldies. So I'm sure you'll hear something you like! This place has only been open about 6 months and business is already booming so if you plan on going, be prepared to wait a little. Be patient! It's worth the wait! The longest I've ever waited to be seated was 30mins which is nothing to me. I'm a very patient person! Things to try the French toast, the scramblers and herb fried chicken with waffle! All excellent! The mimosas are great too! I love the owner, he is very personable and friendly, making sure all your needs have been met. I don't see why you would have any issues but if you ever did I'm sure he would fix everything immediately!",

It's a great place for a social gathering, lots a room, it's clean and fun. They have a DJ that plays different genres of music later in the morning and he's friendly just like the rest of the staff.   Domenic, the Manager, made our group feel very welcomed and you can tell he's a genuine Manager. He's not   the type of Manager that stops by to ask \"how is everything \".. he has a conversation with you and likes to get  to know you, by the time we left it felt like he was an old friend!  My only word of caution is get there early because if you don't you WILL be waiting for a table. Yes,  it's THAT good and I will definitely be going back and will take new friends/family so that they can enjoy it too !",

    "text": "All around this place was fantastic! Be ready for a wait on a weekend, but it'll be well worth it. Located in a typical urban plaza, tucked away in the corner of the parking lot, HK cultivates an environment unique to anything I've seen at a breakfast place. Upon stepping in I felt like I was in a beach club somewhere on vacation. Great music courtesy of a DJ (yeah, at breakfast!), smiling faces, and fresh air and sun flowing in from the patio.   This place has flow and ease. Servers danced their way around us, and though we had a dedicated server everyone was attentive to refilling our water, answering general questions, and cleaning off our table as we slowly made an attempt at the spread that covered our table. Jesus gave us recommendations based off his favorites, which we got two of: the chilaquiles and carnitas hash.   Started off with the bacon board. In retrospect, would not have gotten this. Not because it was bad, but because there was SO MUCH FOOD. Like omg, the three of us could have shared one plate but we had to try it all. Even as busy as it is, the tempo in the place is pretty quick. The time flies even faster if you treat yourself to the Bloody Mary bar. My recommended combo would be the cucumber vodka with medium mix (if you can take the heat), and then stacks on stacks of toppings. Get celery; it gives you more surface area to pin your toppings to!   The chilaquiles were all-star. Smothered in green sauce, but they were still amazingly crispy and warm. Carnitas hash was straight flame too, and fed us for the next two meals for the pre and post game after a night out on Mill. I got for myself the avocado toast, and while I admire the unique twist, if you're a lover of a wholesome and fresh avo toast this probably isn't what you want. The HK take on this dish is pretty dense topped with bacon jam, bacon and fried leeks. That was my mistake though as I didn't read the menu, but I chose with my eyes as I saw other plates coming out of the kitchen.   Honestly, can't wait to be back in the Phoenix area, because I know this will be a go-to for a good start to my day. See you soon! Thanks Jesus!",

My wife and I ordered separately but after seeing the size of the portions we could of easily split an entree. They are huge. Coffee is in huge cups and they bring a thermos to the table so you can refill yourself as needed. My wife ordered French press coffee and it was also brought in a large container. Staff was friendly and attentive. I had the heuvos rancheros hash skillet. It had a large piece carne Asada steak served whole. My one suggestion would be to bring a steak knife when this is served. The steak was thin enough to be cut with a table knife but it would have been easier with a steak knife. My wife also enjoyed her breakfast. I did not indulge in the adult beverages as it was a bit too early in the morning for me but they had a lot of interesting choices.",

The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the wait time. It took about 5 mins before we were greeted with water. It was after the mgr. talked with us that we got water.

    "text": "Imagine if Hash House a Go Go indulged in one too many drinks from the bloody Mary bar, had a wild night with SumoMaya, then had a restaurant baby that they raised on the Jersey Shore. The result would be Hash Kitchen. When you see the upper echelons of management wearing unbuttoned chest-baring shirts adorned with large dangly gold chain necklaces + a load of swagger, a gigantic bloody Mary bar and an in-house DJ spinning loud beats you know you're READY to PARTY and GET DOWN.... at a breakfast spot in Chandler a few yards away from Whole Foods during lunch on a work day?  I'll be honest. I think the combination of party atmosphere and morning breakfast is a bit too much for me. But hey, that's just me. If I want to go to a club I'll go to a club. If I want to eat a meal with someone I want to be able to hear our conversation and not be drowned out by the background of the restaurant. Go ahead you can call me a party pooper. This might be a great spot if you want to indulge in their extensive list of alcoholic drinks, munch on expensive bites and feel like you're brunching with a crowd consisting of customers you might find on the weekend in a club in Old Town Scottsdale (Sans those golf carts strolling down the streets picking up the drunken and disorderly). At least that's the vibe I got when I ate here.   We got here a little bit before noon and it wasn't too bad of a wait on Friday, maybe 5 minutes. The menu online is slightly different from what is offered at this location but the selections still were intriguing. I was initially hoping to see the paella hash which was listed online but since it wasn't an option here I went for the flat iron steak hash. I figured when in a hash kitchen you might as well eat hash, right? I also had a bite of the chilaquiles.  Our food came out fairly quickly and the presentation looked so tempting! The flat iron steak hash comes with potatoes, a sugar coated buttermilk biscuit, 2 poached eggs, onion rings, shishito peppers, peppercorn demi glace, bell peppers and onions as well as the aforementioned steak. Cutting into the steak, it was perfectly medium rare as requested. I tried it with the peppercorn demi glace and found the sauce to have an odd background flavor to it that I didn't really like so I just ate it plain since the steak had enough bold flavor to hold up well on its own. The actual hash tasted decent but it looked a lot like a premade cubed potato mix that comes from a bag. I've seen other breakfast spots use a similar looking mass-produced potato and label it as home fries on their menu.  The chilaquiles tortilla chips were nicely light and crisp, smothered in a vinegary, tangy green sauce. The chicken on top had red sauce mixed in with it. The chicken was alright, not the most tender I've had but it was a good protein to have with the tortilla chips.  Service was excellent. We were checked up on as needed and drinks were filled when they got low.",

We were quoted a 45-60 min wait but it was actually closer to 20 mins.  What a lovely surprise!  We had a Matcha Latte, three different disco cocktails, the Chilaquiles as an appetizer, the Cristina's Tamale Cakes (keep in mind that this is a sweeter tamale since it's made with corn), the Steak Breakfast Burrito, the Lump Crab Hash, and the Mexican Scramble.  As to be expected during opening week, it was quite a wait for food.  Like... a 45min wait for our food to come out.  But when the food came out, everything was hot and fresh.  I won't go into great lengths about every dish but everybody was pretty much happy with their dish with the exception of the Lump Crab Hash which was more reminiscent to burnt stir-fry.  All-in-all, this is a great addition for the city of Chandler and I'm glad they're so close to my favorite spin class studio.  I'll work-out and then get to eat my calories back next door!",

    "text": "This place surprisingly lived up to the hype. Came here around 1pm on a Saturday and got seated quicker than we had expected. It is a bit loud inside as there is a DJ that plays while you dine; music was poppin but the high volume it played at made it a little diffiult to talk amongst ourselves.  The portions are huge! Almost everyone had leftovers to take home. The Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict was so delicious. The English muffin was thick and fluffy, the eggs were cooked to perfection, there was more than enough smoked salmon, and the crispy capers and sauteed spinach were THE best touches. I'm drooling just thinking about it again. I also tried a bite of the banana split brioche and it was very tasty. You can taste the brown sugar and it was not overly sweet like I was expecting it to be.  The Build-Your-Own-Bloody Mary bar was intimidating with how many toppings there were. Priced at $13, you get a small mason jar cup for your customizable Bloody Mary. I tried the cilantro lime vodka and didn't love it, but I was told that it's their most popular. Will have to try the bacon vodka next time. There are tons of pickles, olives and other toppings (salami, cheese, boiled egg, etc.) available for you to top your Bloody Mary. Be sure to save some room for the big ol' meatballs at the end of the bar. Also found at the end are jalapeno poppers (did not get to try these unfortunately) and bacon.   Service was nice and attentive, which made my overall experience a great one on top of the great food.   Things that fell flat, while totally subjective: my meal came with a side of potatoes and they were meh. A little too soft for my liking, not crispy at all and the seasoning was a little bland (I prefer more salty potatoes). The mimosa flight came with four flavors: original, kiwi, strawberry, and blueberry. Between the five of us, only the kiwi and blueberry were popular. The kiwi was refreshing and strong in flavor.",

There were so many things to take in: live DJ, instagram friendly decor, energetic staff, and just so many different walks of life here!  Our server came by immediately to get our drinks started, which I found that later is by far the highlight of this establishment. I was excited to try the Bloody Mary bar, it was something that I missed on my last visit to the location in Chandler. It was cool! Soooo many toppings were available here - too many to list!!! My favorite topping was probably the kimchi.  Dominic, (possibly one of the Managers at this location), stopped by and acknowledged that they were very aware of the impact that social media had on their business and asked us to share our visit. He made sure everything was to our liking and  invited us to visit again - it was a very nice gesture! I always appreciate it when management takes the time to get to know their patrons.  Parking was a bit annoying. There is limited parking due to the popularity of this new restaurant, so bring your patience because you will probably need to park further out than most would like. It might be a good idea to drop someone off at the front door to put your name on the list and go find your parking space after that.   FYI: The wait this morning at 9:30 was about 45 minutes. - not too bad but the front area could definitely use some more misters. The coolest spot on the patio was on the \"dog friendly patio\". They had misters there, but everyone on the patio were without pets...LOL.  Overall, I think this will be a neat place to bring a group of friends for a good music, drinks, and brunch. I'm not sure this is the best place to bring your kiddos, but I did see a lot of families with young children and they do accommodate children with a kids menu.   I will be sure to visit again. For my next visit here, I would like to try their Mocha Frappuccino! Happy brunching!",

    "text": "I think this is really a fun place! The service was out standing! William and Toby took very good care of me. In fact I was looking for my morning cocktail and they did not have my Malibu rum, so Toby whipped up a really nice coconut pineapple ice drink with Bacardi and it was delicious!  On to the food... I really enjoyed the flavor of my smoked salmon eggs Benedict, but I really thought it was too much bread!  I must confess, I am an Eggs Benedict snob!They use biscuits instead of English muffins and the biscuits were very very thick. Don't get me wrong because the biscuits were awesome by themselves, but as part of the Benedict I don't think it worked well. It was too much bread and I  couldn't get one good all-inclusive bite with the salmon, poached egg, spinach, hollandaise sauce and capers.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is really funky! They have a DJ and she was jamming! She played Bruno Mars, The Police and a host of other good songs! They also have a Bloody Mary bar, which is really quite unique! I don't like Bloody Mary's but I can appreciate the fact that it was an awesome looking setup!. So if you like bloody Mary's and funky good music and really good food, you have to give this place a try!",

    "text": "Ok. I've been to all three Hash Kitchen's now. My family was excited about the new chandler location cause it's closer to them but really far for me. Anyways, I'm always game to go to Hash Kitchen.   We got a big table towards the back. Huge wooden table that fit 9 people comfortable. I didn't even have to come through the front door but come in through the back side door because I saw our table. So I didn't even get to experience what the whole restaurant was like but it's just like all the other Hash Kitchen 's on the weekends. DJ playing loud music and lots of people.   I had the Asian Chicken Sandwich which had coleslaw. The bread was really fresh and the chicken and slaw was really good. Really good combination. It works really well together. It was perfect. Was great with the fries. Really filling and I loved it. Gave a bite to my wife and she really liked it too.  My son and wife got the Huevos Rancho Hash. They thought it was okay. The beef was a little over cooked but other than that it was pretty good. Everyone else really enjoyed their meal too.   We ended our meal with Cannoli Donuts. These are freshly fried donuts with the Cannoli inside in the hole of the donut. So you get the freshness of the donut with the sweetness of the Cannoli and it was so good. Really loved it  I thought the service was really good. We had Katrina and she was very good. Very friendly. Kept our water cups and coffee cups filled. We even had the manager Dominic come by and make sure our meal was satisfactory. He was very friendly and took care of us. The only problem we had was with the kitchen. They brought out half of the tables food and we were waiting for the other half for awhile. The people who got their food finished half way by the time we got our food. The server and manger apologized and tried to get our food out as quickly as possible.   So the place is just like the other Hash Kitchens. Very crowded. Very loud with DJ. Very good food but decent service due to the kitchen. We were also told that this location is the experiment menu. They try it out here before the menu item goes out to the other locations. So if you want to try new item on the menu then this is the place to go to.   We love HK and we will be back. Enjoy cause we did.",

We've been here a handful of times and it's always a good time. Good people watching, good music, good food, good drinks. Just be warned, the only things you have to look out for are fist pumps and long waits...as they do get busy. What can I say, PHX people love their brunches.",

It's very much \"on trend\" for the brunch scene and I'm usually wary of that.The wait was about 45 minutes on a 3 day weekend monday.  However once we sat down I was impressed.  The menu has a wide array of options and innovative drinks.  I personally went with mimosas, specifically one kiwi and one blueberry which were amazing and a great price at 6 a pop.  The food is on the pricey side but you get a lot of it. I had gotten the avocado toast. Don't let that fool you,  this is not healthy,  it's indulgent. You get 2 brick sized pieces of toasted brioche piled high. It was well worth the price  The biggest issue is there's inexplicably a DJ playing which quickly becomes overwhelming since it seems this place is also always packed.",

It was a mistake! We we seated immediately by a very nice hostess, even came around a few times to check on us and even took our drink orders.  Why? Because our waitress took FOREVER to get to us. The hostess said our waitress was behind or had a lot of tables but I observed the other waitresses chatting with other patrons, not about their food or etc.  Even observed what looked like a manager chatting and mingling with others next to our table but we were still unattended.  I got pissed!   We never get to really go out, I work full time and go to school, my husband works so much and we have kids.  So on our anniversary, we just needed time for ourselves and this is how it starts??  Anyway when the waitress did come she was handing me a ticket and impatiently looked at us like WE were crazy. I ordered the build your own Bloody Mary, our first time there, I have no idea what this ticket means. She finally says , didn't one of you order the Bloody Mary? I said yes but it's our first time there so I had no idea what she was handing me. She said go over to the bar and pointed to the BM bar and the bartender will start you off. I got even more angry, I felt like I inconvenienced her to tell me this information. The bartender was exceptional! I got my drink!   The food came, we both ordered the carne asada with egg whites, hash, onions , avocado and Pico. The meat was not medium as ordered, the avocado was as hard as a rock, the Pico tasted old. The hash and onions were good. We decided not to order desert as planned, given the risk, and then that was it.   The bartender- 5 stars  Waitress - 1 star  Restaurant - 2 stars since I loved the Bloody Mary   Unfortunately we will not be returning.",

It's funny how huge of a difference management makes. My food was not only delicious but warm. I hade an iced mocha & they have almond milk which was awesome.

The manager came by several times asking if we were well taken cared of. Food servings is enough for sharing which we did we the avocado toast. We also ordered mimosa flights and a couple of scrambled dishes.   Can't wait to come back here for brunch!",

The Bloody Mary bar is a site to behold! You basically could just eat that. There's also a mimosa flight just in case you want to try them all.   Start with a Bacon Board for your appetizer, you won't WANT to share but it's great size so you'll need to. I ordered the chilaqules and they were tangy, spicy, and just slightly crunchy. They were just perfect! If you want something sweet, the cannoli pancakes are the way to go! Sweet, fluffly, and massive! I came with a group and we all just ordered some  things and shared them all. Which is the best way to do!   If you want to try this place and haven't because its in Chandler and you think that you'll get the same experience....you won't. The Hash in Chandler is the only one I'll go to. I tried the one in Arcadia and was appalled by the service. The Chandler location is the only one that I'll visit! Not to mention that this one is the only one with the Bacon Board!",

Our server Kendra was busy with the whole patio and was still attentive and helpful throughout our meal.  The food was AMAZING. The pretzel benedict is one of the best brunch dishes I've ever had. I'm vegetarian so I subbed spinach for the bacon and it was surreal.  The bloody mary bar is an awesome idea. I had one that was awesome, but switched over to the mimosa flight and WOW! So good and only $16... definitely will be returning with more people next time.",

The bar garnishes are meats, cheeses, olives, bacon, more processed meats, and pickles upon pickled items! Yummy, but yikes! I'm bloated. Hehehehehe! I ordered the carnitas hash. It was pretty good, I think I would order something else next time though. It wasn't second ordering worthy. The potatoes were cold at the bottom of skillet, and seemed old, or left over taste. We came at 12:30 on a Wednesday, was not busy. Our server was slow, and never offered us hot sauce, salsa or ketchup.  I'll give it another try, but my VERY FIRST impression was VERY DISAPPOINTING. So sad! I've been dying to come here!",

Hash kitchen is definitely the latter and I believe it will be a valley staple for decades to come.  The food magnificent,  the drinks spectacular,  and the wait for such quality and entertainment to be expected.  Anything you order will be good and plentiful.  Fantastic beverages great service friendly happy people,  a great way to start the day.  Order drinks from inside not at the outside window is my only BIG tip  (It'll save you the feeling of rejection at the outside window where you'll be directed inside).   Get the French toast for sure,  the skillets may be a little carb heavy as I prefer more protein.  If the state drinks for arizona are bloody Mary's and mimosas as I've come to see they are then this is definitely your spot.  Oh yeah.... live DJ(Great Music).",

We had the avocado toast and the corn beef hash Benedict. Both amazing. And could only finish half, it was so much food.  If you want something new and cool this is your place. If you want a typical breakfast this might not be for you.",

    "text": "As I always say, I'm VERY particular and hard to please. That said, Newbie to Hash Kitchen. A group of us went on Saturday, most of us first timers.   Overall, it was a good experience. The cons: LONG wait times!! We went at 9:30 a.m. and we waited approximately 40 minutes to be seated \"first available\". We ended up being seated on the patio in the corner. Worst seat in the place but we did ask for first available. My recommendation, sit inside or you miss out on the ambiance and the cool vibe this place offers. Anyway, that was the only negative part of our experience. Positive: Excellent food, drinks, music, and service. Our server was very attentive. The manager Domenic was awesome and very entertaining to have a conversation with. Both made us feel very welcome and wanted to make sure we had an enjoyable first time experience. If you're a Bloody Mary kind of person, you'll LOVE the Bloody Mary bar as you get to build it yourself, so pile on the food and all the extras. I personally did the Mimosa flight. My daughter tried the Cereal flight and hubs had the Bloody Mary. Everyone in our group was highly satisfied with our choice of entree. Though we asked for extra crispy bacon, it came out limp both times. Entrees were very good portions. For example, one of us order buttermilk pancakes and you get a huge stack of 4 large pancakes. I personally had the sausage gravy and biscuits which were very tasty and filling.   FYI: If you plan on drinking and eating, plan on spending about $25 per person plus tax and tip for a flight or Bloody Mary and an entree. Also, if you're not into crowds and loud restaurants, this place is definitely not for you. They have a live DJ playing music. Parking is a bit crazy as the lot directly in front of Hash is small however there's a big lot to the west of the restaurant.   We are anxious to go back and this time we'll go early and choose to sit inside! Looking forward to it.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this pace for a while. Met my husband for lunch today and I have to say I (we) were pretty disappointed.   They are very popular so they were pretty busy. Our server was nice and attentive despite how busy they were.   I ordered the herb fried chicken hash and my husband the huevos ranchero hash.   Our food came and looked good however the huevos rancheros has fried leeks all over it. My husband asked the waitress if it was supposed to come that way (because he would have asked for it to be left off) and she replied that it was. He said he didn't see it on the menu - she went to show him but turned out it wasn't on the menu at all. No offer to remake the meal but my husband decided to just pick them off. There was no avocado with the meal either which IS on the menu.   As we ate I noticed how dry my potatoes were. Just dry and a little old/cold and bland. It was my first time so I didn't know what to expect but in my mind a 'hash' shouldn't be so dry and bland. My chicken was pretty dry and over cooked as well. The egg was good.  Looking at the pics here, my food was nothing like those in the pics.   My husband's food was dry as well. So much so that he asked for extra red chili sauce commenting that his food was so dry and that it was much better the last time he was here. Still, no offer to remake the meal but the extra sauce he shared helped both of us eat our meals.   I really heard great things and was sad our experience wasn't good. The tables around us looked great - especially the bloody mary's!  I will probably try again and order something different.  My husband said he probably wouldn't be back.   Hash is literally in their name. The hash should be the best thing they serve - not the worst for $14 and $16!",

The vibes here were so fun and the atmosphere was incredibly welcoming and hip! Food came out at a reasonable time and exceeded expectations! Sooo yummy! All the classic breakfast foods had a yummy new twist to them. Like an over-medium egg with some delicious seasoning on it!

That seemed steep but I still wanted to try them.  I was expecting miniature sized mimosas but instead received 4 nearly full sized mimosas.  The two guys ordered the Bloody Mary bar at $12 each.  Again, a little pricey but with over 40 items to build your own, it also felt like a decent value.    First impression of the menu was that it was like the drinks, expensive, but once you see the portion sizes and taste the quality, you feel like you're getting what you're paying for.     The vibe was cool too.  Loved the decor and atmosphere.  We went on a Tuesday and didn't have to wait for a table but I imagine the weekends with the DJ there, the wait time will be long.   Lastly, our server, Kim was amazing!  Fun lady to talk to and super knowledgeable and patient in answering our many questions!",

Then, even our leftover burgers eaten the next day were awesome (can that really be?).  The burgers were as good this time?  Is it the bacon?  The beef? We don't know.  While there we kept seeing interesting things at other tables that we wanted to come back and try.  Including Bloody Marys from the Bloody Mary bar and the enticing Mimosa flight.  Our waiter Jose gave us great service and Domenic the manager came by to check on us and chat.  Will definitely go back.",

We were quoted a wait time of an hour but were seated within 30 minutes which was nice.  I ordered I got the Italian Sausage Hash with egg whites. The food did take some time to come out but it was well worth the wait. It was clear that the restaurant had just opened at that location as the waitresss wasn't that knowledgeable about the menu but was still nice enough. Some sides were forgotten to be brought out, (side of sausage, side of potatoes) but waitress and management was super apologetic.

My wife and her friend split the Avocado toast, which was definitely a plate for 2. Our server, Sarah, was super attentive and polite. The manager, Dominick, made sure to stop by our table and ask us how our food and service was. That was classy. They had a DJ come in around 9am and start mixing tunes.

It was Way more than I expected for a breakfast spot in Chandler.  This was my first time visit and Our server told us it's been busy since they opened a week ago. Pasted on a wall was \"The Brunch Life\", which accurately describes the vibe of the restaurant. It's reminiscent of what you'd find in downtown Scottsdale.  The customers service was excellent. The hostess, servers and managers all checked on us to see how we were doing. The food was delicious and the coffee was strong. Next time I go, I look forward to trying some adult beverages like the mimosa flight or their disco ball slush that's topped with cotton candy.  This will probably end up being my go to brunch spot!   Cons: our server forgot to put our breakfast bruschetta order in and so once reminded it came out after we had eaten. It was delicious though. Also, the bathrooms were completely out of toilet paper. Annoying but both issues can be easily fixed.",

We had plenty of time to do that, because service was S.L.O.W.  It wasn't even crowded or busy and I noticed staffing wasn't an issue. Ordered a coffee drink to begin with and it took over 5 minutes to get and it tasted like the barista forgot the coffee. At $5, I should taste the coffee! We ordered a starter that took longer than anticipated to arrive. Enjoyed that for a while before the server came back to take our order. Breakfast took an hour and a half during slow business hours, I'd hate to go during peek business hours! We even had to ask for refills on water! Yikes! The food was wildly overpriced even though the food was picturesque. I suppose I was paying for presentation. I will not be going back, which I'm sure won't affect the hype, but if there is another 'hot & new' place recommended on Yelp, go there!",

I kept it basic, pancakes (which were impossibly perfect, turkey bacon (major props for that option) and some potatoes. The man got the chicken and wafles (crushed it) and our friends got the breakfast steak burritos, which I kid you not are the size of a new baby and they said they were incredible! All kinds of hot sauces to choose from- again a huge win in my book. The people next to us got the fruity pebbles pancakes which they said were a big thumbs up too. So many fun dishes to come back and try.  Food was amazing. Bloody Mary bar is insane. You could make a meal there alone. Mimosa's...mmm. All kinds of fun drinks to try. Nice BIG coffee mugs. A plus for a guzzler like me.  Service was spot on. I am SO sad I cannot recall our server's name but she was amazing, I even looked at the receipt when we got home so I could give her a shout out...and it just said bar...  We sat inside by the bar, the atmosphere is great, family friendly but very cool for gathering with friends. Great looking patio, dj playing some fun music to get your morning started right.  Prices are really reasonable for the quality and quantity of food.  The manager Dominic came over and visited with us, ensuring everything was all we hoped and dreamed it would be. It was all that and more! I drive Lyft on the weekends and have been telling all my riders about how great this place is. In retrospect maybe I should have kept it a secret because it was already busy! But I was impressed with how quickly we were seated, greeted and fed. Definitely will return with the kids, more friends and family...",

I got the bagel breakfast sandwhich sliders that were also amazing and were presented on a wood board instead of a normal plate. On top of all of that we each got a \"build your own\" bloody mary. We got to choose the flavor of alcohol and got to pick out any toppings that we wanted; so awesome. At the end of our meal we also ordered some cereal shots that were so fun!

My girlfriend had the salmon board the first time, totally loved it and then the bruschetta 3 ways for round 2. Also DELICIOUS. The wait was expected, and turned out to be shorter than the estimate -both visits we were given a 45-60 minutes wait time and were sat within 30 minutes- and since you  can visit the bar while you wait, really not an issue  the DJ is kinda loud but I am also 34 so maybe I'm just old?  But really... it's Chandler, and aren't we all?  Whatever, not too loud to detour me from returning clearly. The patio is super nice, totally excited for fall brunch. The service staff is great, everyone is really nice and attentive. I'd give it 5 stars except there is no bottomless mimosa or bottle option and that's a bit of an issue for me and my girlfriends... after all what is brunch if not Mimosas with a side of good food?",

Bloody Mary bar is impressive but that was about it. We started with the bacon board. I ordered the Spaniard firtatta and my friend order Chicken Tinga and pancakes. When the bacon board was dropped off no one told us which bacons were which so we got to play the guessing game. I ordered my Firtatta with no tomatoes or potatoes and specified I was allergic. Also asked what I could get instead of the side of potatoes and was told fruit. When my food was dropped off it still came with a side of potatoes and potatoes in the dish. I said I couldn't eat it because I was allergic. They offered to remake it. My friend received his pancakes but never his chicken tinga. We just assumed they hadn't been rang in. At 1 point we had 2 managers at our table and they asked why I had no food in front of me. The acknowledged it would be out quick. When it did arrive it had a side of potatoes with it. If that's not a slap in the face when you've specified twice you have an allergy. After that our server was not to be heard from until we waved him down and asked for our check so we could pay. When the bill was dropped off everything was on there. The chicken tinga. The modifier that said no potato no tomato. Oh and my side of fruit that was 2.50 for a single piece of watermelon, , cantaloupe, and honey dew. Had to insist the chicken tinga be taken off because it never showed up. By the end it was just comical at how much the ball was dropped. Will most likely not come back.",

    "text": "So I dragged my friend here to give it a shot. Walking in I shocked st hiw loud it was. They dont need a DJ but it's a cute gimmick. We were told it would be short wait and went to look at the bloody Mary bar and it's amazing I was just wowed. We asked if the bar was open and then decided to sit there. Both bar tenders were really nice. My water glass had some food in it so I asked for a new glass of water. We ordered our food and drinks which came out fast but I never got my ordered drink. I let it slide they were busy.As we our taking our first bite we found the longest hair in our Avacado toast. My hair is braided and my friend had short hair so we knew it wasn't ours and it was literally entwined in the food. We sent it back. This is when my drink finally shows up. I'd honestly forgot about it and was settled with my water. We were sharing and the bartender asked me do I want to send mine back too. Ummm yeah it's the same food. So we get new food and the rest of the food comes out. It's missing the bacon. So then she has to get a side order of bacon for the sandwich. As we are checking out the bartender spoke with the manager Dom and he took the avocado toast off the bill just because of what happened. The food was excellent but I had to knock off some stars but I'll probably try them again.",

I sat at the bar and the Bartender was very friendly however there was a manager behind the bar trying drinks and never asked how I was doing or even said hello to me. The food was below average. I ordered the Cannoli Donuts and a Carnitas Hash. The donuts were so dense I could barely eat one. Also the hash was  below average as well, the potatoes were cold, the green chili pork was dry and had no sauce. The best part of the dish were the crispy onions on top.",

    "text": "When you first hear the name, you think, \"Oh it's probably just a low-key, hole-in-the-wall, mom and pop brunch place.\" Even standing outside you'd probably have the same thought. However, as soon as you open the door, you're slapped in the face by what can only be described as pure excitement. Now, I'm not much of a Yelp reviewer, but this place IS THAT GOOD. From the moment we walked in until the moment we walked out, the service was outstanding. The staff went above and beyond to make our first experience there one we will not soon forget. The music was fun and upbeat (in part because they had an actual DJ), and the food was to die for. We both ended up ordering something the server had suggested (I wish I would've remembered her name because she was incredibly helpful) and honestly we were amazed at how quickly it came out and how delicious it was. I'd go as far as to say it came out within seconds, but it was probably a few minutes. You get so caught up in all of the buzz happening around you, you aren't really paying that much attention. ANYWAY, on top of all of that...wait for it... THEY HAVE A BUILD YOUR OWN BLOODY MARY BAR. Now all the soccer moms are probably thinking, \"shut the front door,\" but I crap you not, they have everything that your big kid hearts could ever want inside/on top of/around a Bloody Mary. Fast forward through our friendly banter and face shoveling, towards the end of our meal one of the managers came over to ask us about our experience and I didn't have as many words as I do now to describe it. To me, this said a lot about the company. When a manager is willing to take the time to walk around and chat with the customers about how the food or service is, ESPECIALLY when they have no idea if there will be bad or good reviews, that's when you know they mean it. DOM, thanks for showing us a good time and making sure that we enjoyed ourselves. I can safely say, that I will be spreading the word about this fine establishment.",

I was excited to have some options other than the usual pancakes or grilled cheese option. I decided to do the beyond burger since it sounded delicious with grilled peppers. As i was ordering it the waiter said \"the bun isn't vegan, we don't have any vegan bread\". So.. why say you have vegan options then, either do or don't, don't half-ass have vegan options. I would have had to get the burger with no bun in order to be vegan. The burger was alright but I wasn't impressed with their lack of options.",

Last but not least the manager Dominic or as he said \" the little Italian\" was so friendly and ensured to check in on us.  We also had a very attentive waiter by the name of Truman he was so sweet with my daughter when she broke her crayons. If you have kids you know how it feels when people are just genuinely sweet with the kiddos !!If you have time make sure to stop in it will be worth it.",

Maybe trying to do too much. 5 of us went for breakfast. We started with coffee, a few of the build your own bloody Mary's, and a mimosa. The drinks were average. For food, we ordered the avocado toast, berry waffle, overnight oats, veggie omelet, and the steak breakfast burrito. Sadly the oats were the best one, and it was pretty average. The avocado toast was massive and just not good. The burrito was mostly just potatoes, very little steak or bacon. The waffle was okay. The omelet was bland.  Service was also not great. We were wanting to ask for some hot sauce for the omelet and for the potato burrito, but waiter never came around until we were finished.   It is a fun looking place, with a fun looking menu, that really let us down with the delivery.",

    "text": "I can die now.  I thought Sunday brunch was for basic bitches -- but we had family in town that weren't jazzed by the idea of a breakfast burrito from a taco shop.  An employee in one of the shops at Chandler Fashion Square recommended Hash Kitchen to my parents the night before and told them it was her new favorite restaurant.  We scoped out the menu and I was lured in by the promise of an enormous plate of cannoli pancakes.  Sold.  When we arrived, there was a huge crowd outside waiting to get in.  \"No way, Jose,\" I informed my parents and attempted to leave the parking lot but they were insistent that we stay.  Upon entry, we were advised that it would be approximately 45 minutes before being sat.  Groan!  I NEVER wait 45 minutes anywhere.  I don't have the patience for it.    However... that 45 minute wait turned into the best brunch experience in the valley.  Hands down.   First of all, they opened an outside bar window for the people waiting to be sat so you could create yourself a bloody mary from a huge build-your-own bloody mary bar.  I went for the 32 oz bloody mary to calm my nerves from being stuck outside in anticipation of my food.  I loaded it up -- pickled eggs, bacon, a Slim Jim, mozzarella on a stick -- this bloody mary bar was INSANE!   I couldn't even list off everything I topped mine off with.  It was so nutty that when I was done, some German tourists asked me to take a picture with them and my bloody mary.  I'm an attention whore so I gladly helped them out.  We were sat in less than the expected wait time.  The atmosphere inside is like a bright, brunchy party with a DJ mixing up some dope ass beats.    Ashton was our server and she took great care of us.  She answered a lot of questions about the menu and really made us feel welcome.  We never felt rushed or like we were a bother when we needed refills or ketchup or had special requests.  Insanely good service.  The manager, Dominic, came out and introduced himself to us.  Not only was he a low-key sexy beast, but he made sure we were having a great experience.  Very nice guy and that goes a long way.  Not one of those managers that goes around and you feel like it's phony, part of their job.  You could tell he was genuinely concerned with any feedback we may have and had a desire to make sure we were happy and the restaurant as a whole was successful in all aspects.  A+++ for customer service from both management and wait staff.    The food -- huge portions, cool options.  Stop what you're doing and look at their pancake menu right now.  They have Fruity Pebble pancakes served with a rich vanilla custard sauce.  A member of our party got them and they were OFF THE CHAIN.  I got the fried chicken benedict and my mind was blown.  Gourmet, delicious, the food looked beautiful.    Brunch perfected.    I don't get all these people raving about the place and giving it four stars.  Star snobs!  This place is 5-star all the way in my book, baby!  Put that in your pipe and smoke it!    We will be back and my mind is forever changed about brunch.  A new favorite restaurant.",

The atmosphere is like a nightclub with the music blaring which is ok if you are at a dance club but it's not ok for breakfast. I did like the music selection though; the DJ just needs to turn the music down.  The DJ did an excellent job with music selection!  It would be nice to hear the music and be able to talk at the same time and not have to yell.  You will definitely get a headache in this restaurant. The Hash Kitchen in Scottsdale plays music like this but it's not so loud that you have to yell to carry on a conversation! This restaurant could have the best of both worlds they just need to turn the music down a little bit. Definitely don't bring out of town guests here to catch up because you will not be able to talk and definitely don't bring your grandparents or in laws here!:)  Hehehehe!!",

There the two bars, one is a bloody mary bar.   Although they were crowded, we got seated and served quickly. The server and Manager, Dominic were very nice. Surprised to hear the same owner as the Sicilian Butcher Block in north Phoenix. Good question from the server, sweet or savory? Since the size of the dish is large, my wife and I split the Carnitas Hash ($16) and half of the classic French Toast ($5.50) with two coffees ($5.50).  I loved the flavor of the Carnitas Hash. The diced potatoes, thin fried onions, pork, and over easy egg was great. The dish had a small amount of heat to it, which I liked. If I could recommend two things may be a bit more pork and green chili, for the price. I didn't see any chili, but I could taste it. I would have preferred to dip the tortilla into the skillet but there was no sauce to dip it into. Oh, you might want to use a spoon instead of a fork to eat all the potatoes.  I was happy for the quick service, but we were being interrupted often. After I finished the French Toast, still several pieces left for my wife to eat, a person who was not a server, possibly a manager came by to pick it up. I put up my hand to stop him, he said sorry. It's nice to have great service but to aggressive service can be bad.  Yes, we will be back. This breakfast or lunch restaurant is new and interesting. Be prepared to spend a bit more than the run of the mill breakfast restaurant.",

Obviously it was not a real Reuben--and it was not billed as such so that's fine--but regardless, I found it cold at the center and the cheese literally wasn't even melted, making for a less than pleasing textural encounter. Fries were redeeming and saved this venue from a 2-star review.   Service was fine, but not particularly mind-blowing considering that this is one of the pricier venues in the East Valley. Also, there was randomly a DJ and I still have no clue if I thought that was cool or not because on one hand, \"Cool! A DJ!\" And on the other hand, \"Oh my god I can't hear anything over this mix of hot songs from 2015 blaring out of the speakers on a Sunday morning.\"",

The Bloody Mary bar seems cool but if you don't like bloody Mary's the drink menu appears original and fun but the drinks taste very basic. Food wise it was very mediocre. To spend 17 dollars on a plate you think it would have a better spread. They use frozen potatoes yet emphasize how good the potatoes are. I expected fresh ones. the steak we ordered we asked for medium rare and it was well done and not seasoned. Everything was just bland. The decor is nice but I wish they put more effort into their food. I was really really let down.. also... flies are everywhere and it's gross.",

The service was nice and speedy and at the end of our meal the manager Dominic came by and chatted for a few minutes.

I could literally put my finger in the center of my eggs and cold and the quinoa burger and the bun were only warm on the edge center was ice cold. We sent it back and still  o refill on water.

The bar was full, a DJ was playing loud music... I mean, A DJ.. at 10am on a Saturday morning. Not my ideal for a nice brunch the morning after a typical Friday night out, but we decided to give it a shot. The food -as fancy as the presentation is- is mediocre at best. Their so-called \"best seller\" Lemon Ricotta Pancakes lacked flavor and was disappointing. Oh, and how do you mess up biscuits and gravy? By slopping on a pile of scrambled eggs and seasoning all over it. There wasn't enough gravy so I asked the server if I could have a little more, and the guy tells me that the gravy is MEASURED and that he would have to charge me for extra! Measured?? Seriously? I declined, but when the manager (Dominic) came around to our table while making his rounds, I mentioned how the dish needed more gravy and he happily brought me more and ensured that we enjoyed the rest of our meal. The spot has a cool vibe and seems like the trending place to be, but don't go here if you're looking for a quiet brunch or excellent food.",

I initially called around noon to see what the wait time was for a table for two and was told 15-20 minutes.  My other half and I drove here and the Hostess was very polite and professional.  I asked about the bloodymary bar and she explained how it worked.  You basically get a ticket from your waitress and go up there to redeem it.  Simple I thought.  We were seated, sat and waited and waited and waited, and our assigned waitress never acknowledged us, nor did anyone else and there we were surrounded by empty tables.  Dumbfounded by why this restaurant has so many positive reviews with almost 5 stars we were not happy with being first time customers!  I ended up getting up to ask the Hostess if she could see about sending over our waitress/waiter to our table.  In the meantime, the bartender got our drink orders.  Our waitress came a few minutes later and walked up to us and right off she asks, \"What can I get you guys to eat?\"  Not a single hi how are you, sorry for the wait or let me tell you how Hash Kitchen works.  I was kind of pissed, annoyed and ready to leave.  Even the manager apologized but not to my satisfaction.  Even though the experience was bad we still payed full price.  Now the taste of food....I ordered a scrambler and added (what I thought was going into my scrambler since they call them adds) green bell peppers and avocado.  Instead they put my avocado on the side! Put my green bell peppers on top of my scrambler!  Really, Hash Kitchen cooks?!  I was again not impressed.  My husband ordered waffles and chicken and the chicken was very bland, no flavor at all.  Between service and food we were not impressed one bit.",

    "text": "We visited less than a week after it opened.  We were quite impressed by the food and the service.  The manager came over to greet us and ask for our feedback on everything.  We were a little surprised by the availability of seating here, but I think once they have their official grand opening and get some buzz, it will be packed for lunch.",

    "text": "Tried this place for the first time today. The food was amazing!! The atmosphere is very fun, they actually have a DJ set up. Employees were very friendly. It seems a little loud at first, but you are able to carry on conversations with no problem. Because they are so new, I think they are still working out some service kinks. Our food took a while. The table next to us was occupied when we sat down. They paid their bill and left. Then, a couple sat down , ordered and their food arrived before ours. (we were a party of 2 as well) Also, the fried herb chicken hash that I ordered surprised me when it arrived without an egg. I commented to the manager that I found it odd that hash would come without eggs and he stated that some of the hash plates do come with egg and some don't. Well, I checked the menu when I got home and it should have come with a poached egg!!!! Avocado hash toast was the other dish that we ordered and it was delicious!  Dominic was the manager that checked on us. He was very genuine and seemed to appreciate our honest feedback. (It didn't hurt that he was a fellow Bostonian..... fellow Cape Codder actually. ) I will definitely be returning ....... there were several more menu items that looked amazing.",

    "text": "I had no idea what to expect coming in here but the menu sounded AMAZING and a friend had said she heard it was good. So me and a friend went for brunch on a Friday morning at 11am and walked in to ridiculously loud music. I didn't notice the DJ set up until the server pointed it out. It was quite awful. This place is very hipster which combined with the music is 100% not my scene so I felt uncomfortable there from the get. I was just there for a good meal! Having looked at the menu ahead of time, I knew I wanted Dr Art Mollens veggie frittata. It was apparently loaded with veg and topped with goat cheese which is my fave. It also came with a side of potatoes and a biscuit and while I don't eat either typically, I figured I would try both seeing as how the food has such rave reviews. The food came and presentation was great. I took a bite of my frittata and it tasted... like goat cheese. The bites that I took with no goat cheese tasted like plain egg. I am 100% not exaggerating when I say there was NO seasoning added to this frittata. None. I doused it in salt and pepper to give it some. I tasted the potatoes which were not even salted. Not only that, but I would bet they are frozen Ore Ida hash browns ... the ones that have the little peppers and onions in them. They look identical. But again, flavorless. The last thing to try was the biscuit. So I break off a little piece and immediately notice it is soooo dry. SO. DRY. So I put some butter on it and drizzle some honey and what did I taste? Some honey. Again, the dry ass biscuit had no flavor. The entire meal was a complete let down. The food sucked. The ambience was miserable with the loud music. Service was awful. I will absolutely never ever return. There are way too many good breakfast restaurants out there. I don't know how people are giving the food high ratings. Maybe they were already drunk off the Bloody Mary bar. ",

    "text": "Okay.... I have been to Hash Kitchen twice before with a friend and loved the food and just knew my husband would love the bloody mary bar!!!  So, my husband, daughter and I went.  We got our table... sat there for at least 7 to 8 minutes before our server acknowledged us.  By then we knew exactly what we wanted to order!  Our server, Kim, took all of our information and we waited.  When you order the Bloody Mary from the table you have to wait for your server to give you a ticket.... we waited .... and waited some more and then Dominick came to the table.  Told him we would really like to get the ticket for the bar.  Finally.... my husband gets it and while he is having to wait in a long line out comes our food!  At which time my food comes without butter and syrup and my husband is still in line.... By this time another manager, Summer, comes to our table and asks if everything is okay.  At first I give her a thumbs up then she continues to ask so I tell her.... we have waited and now my husbands food is getting cold because he is having to wait some more, I have no syrup or butter.  She insisted that she was going to have his food fired up again and she would take care of us.  I told her I'm not looking for anything free I would just like to have a nice breakfast with my family!!!  She told me she was going to make sure I had a great day and that everything was going to be okay and off she went.  Never saw her again!!!  My husband ate the cold breakfast.... our waitress told me she would talk to the manager and get his breakfast removed from our ticket.  Needless to say nothing was ever said or done... $72.00 later we walked out of there with less than stellar thoughts!  I will say, we enjoyed the atmosphere!!!  If I ever go back we will go first thing, different waitress and order the bloody mary in advance of getting seated!!!!  The table next to us had sat after us, ate, left and another group was sitting there almost done eating by the time we left!!!  Incredible!!!  Step it up Kim, Summer and Dominick!!!",

    "text": "Our group of four stopped by for a late breakfast/early lunch on a Friday around 11:30am. The place was packed with a twenty minute wait for a table. Being a regular customer, our previous visits were always between Mon-Thur, this was our first Fri visit. We did not realize there was a DJ playing very loud music Fri-Sun. While we enjoyed the upbeat music, we felt it was extremely loud and very difficult to hold a normal conversation. We decided that we would never visit Fri-Sun because of the music. Suggest the music volume be reduced to allow for normal conversation (I assume diners are flocking in for the excellent food, not the music). Our group ordered the following: Avocado Toast Hash Style (HUGE portion and delicious), the Bacon & Egg Burger (made as requested, medium-well and delicious), Cubano sandwich (excellent), and last, Biscuits/Gravy & Italian Sausage (not your traditional biscuits and gravy). The food was great as usual but our complaint was that our meals came out sporadically and there was a long wait for for one person in our group (not pleased). The first two meals arrived in a reasonable time and the third entree came five minutes later. We were not pleased that one person was without a meal so we waited and stayed patient and politely asked another server to check on our last entree. After another ten minutes, the fourth entree arrived. We found our server was very friendly but not very attentive (likely too busy juggling all her tables). I do give a lot of credit to our server, she apologized at the end of our meal for the long gap between the delivery of our entrees and notified Dominic (Manager) of the issue we encounterd. Dominic delivered our bill and apologized profusely for the issue and he had adjusted our bill to make things right. We all appreciated Dominic's openness and actions to correct the situation.  We realize things happen so this issue will not deter us and we will return, just not Fri-Sun.",
