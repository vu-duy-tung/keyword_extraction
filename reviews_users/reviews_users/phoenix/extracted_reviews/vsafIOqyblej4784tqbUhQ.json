    "text": "I had Pizza and wings at Uncle Sam's today and as usual it was really good.  The wings are ALWAYS tasty and the pizza is the best in the Valley in my opinion.    Service is typically great.  Quick and always coming back for drink refills etc.  Good for watching sports but not a sports bar.  I like that.  The only reason this place doesn't get a full five stars is the parking at the 32nd Street and Shea location is always dicey.  Way too small and I'm always wondering if I'm going to back into someone, or if I'm going to be able to get out of my car!    Once inside though everything is great at this neighborhood classic.    (A little trivia... this was originally a \"Pizza Inn\" restaurant that was built in the mid to early 70's around Phoenix.  There was one in my neighborhood at 7th Street and Thunderbird.  Good times eating there back in grade school!)",

(I like to dip it in the honey hot wing sauce). Pretty reasonably priced as well. Service is usually pretty good and fast.    The only down fall is that they don't play any music or TV audio so if you're in there when its not very busy you can hear every conversation in the place. A little awkward.",

Thank goodness the fries were worthy. To top it off, our check was over $30 which is ridiculous for 2 sub-par subs, fries and 2 Cokes. It was Subway quality IMO. I really wanted to like this place.",

    "text": "So after staying away for nearly a year due to the sad gradual decline of the place we decided to give it another shot.  I guess as a kid who grew up with their delicious pizza and cheesesteaks I just couldn't abandon them and stay away forever!  Have to say, after one visit back they are well on their way to winning us back.  Service was prompt, friendly, and much more of the All American high school vibe I remember than the kind of trashy strung out stripper types they've had working there over the past several years.  But on to the important stuff, the food!  We ordered a half cheesesteak, sams special pizza, zucchini, and chicken fingers for the kid.  Healthy I know!  The food was like I remember it, prompt, fresh, hot and delicious.  My only complaint is a familiar one, they need to put more cheese on the cheesesteaks!  But other than that it was a lot more like the \"good old days\" at Uncle Sams that I remember.  We'll be back and let's hope they keep it up!",

Today it was so bad, I will never go back.  Our waitress appeared was unable to keep up with her tables. Took forever to order drinks, was never offered a single refill, not enough plates or silverware, had to ask 3 times to place a to go order, and then we had to walk up to the counter to get our bill after waiting 10 minutes for it. Every table in her section was complaining about the service, loudly enough that we could all hear...and yet other waitresses or management never came over to check on us or help her out.  When I finally went up to get the bill, I told a girl who claimed to be an assistant manager about our horrible service. She did nothing to fix the situation except tell us that the waitress was new and run our bill. I will miss their white pizza, but I am never going back there. I have been frustrated with their service for the last time.",

I heard good things about their cheesesteaks, and since I have never had a cheesesteak before I thought I'd try them out. There wasn't much meat in the sandwich, and it lacked cheese. I told them no onions and yet onions were still sprinkled throughout the sandwich.  Even their salad was terrible, the ranch was runny and it didn't even have any croutons on it. The prices were kind of high and the place was extremely dirty. Will never go back again.",

My g/f dips her pizza in the honey hot wing sauce and boom game over its the bomb. Im almost here weekly if not bi-weekly to eat and have a drink. Cant go wrong with this place and it being 1/4 miles away from my home its a bonus.  This place would get a 5th star if it werent for how quiet this place can be which puts out a very uncomfortable vibe. I have been booted from this place twice during happy hour for being too loud and or cursing. They have a jukebox but nobody uses it and they usually dont play the audio from the TV's. When theres no music/tv audio on the place is a ghost town because everybody dining doesnt want to talk too loud to disrupt the silence.",

    "text": "I'm so conflicted here, that I will just add the pros and cons and land in the middle with my rating. Uncle Sam's has what is arguably the cheapest Happy Hour drinks in all the Valley. Beer is a buck a pint and a half bottle of wine for 5 bucks! It goes until 7, so we usually squeak in just under the gun. The \"Bail Out Plan\" menu is also incredibly varied and cheap. They do lots of mailings and coupons as well. The food is good (not great), but always seems to satisfy! Service varies, but is generally quite speedy and good. The servers look somewhat hustled and overworked.  I wish I could give the place a quick update of style and maybe some new floors, tables, and a different layout. It seems too crowded with tables and can get really loud. Word of advice: sit in the \"front half\". The back seems even more conducive to a panic attack from sitting literally right next to another table. They need a re-brand and some new plates and silverware. There is a small patio out front with some concrete tables. You can tell they keep the place clean, it just needs a makeover. We unfortunately have sat by some fellow patrons lately who seem to fight, forget they are adults in public and really seem to bring the place down. For these negatives, I give 3 stars. Uncle Sam's sure tries, but there is unfortunately some work to be done!  However, if you like cheaply priced beer, wine and food, this place is for you! We keep going back!",

It seemed like they had been sitting on a hot grill for days. I only left a two star review for the meatballs. I'm sure they have a lot of great food, but I will skip the meatballs and I suggest everyone else does until they figure out how to properly cook them.

I guess the awkward part of it all is that I'm not 23 anymore and my expectations are higher than they use to be. Like tonight, for example. I placed an easy order of happy hour wings and a brew. Well... no. I got a full order. When I informed the server ( young red head with tats behind her ears and plugs) that I only ordered a small order of wings, she offered to get me a box. I figured this was so she didn't have to get management involved with the switch or what not, despite my eager suggestion. Needless to say, the evening continued. I eat one wing... literally one! A cockroach walks onto the bar. It was small and may have been a beetle, but still... ew! ! There goes my appetite!    Words of advice.  If you do decide to come to good ol' Unc' Sam's, wear protection. Serves with mediocre at best. The gals working there are 12, so I don't expect much I suppose. However,  the Peoria location is much better and cleaner ( it seems like). I'm only giving two stars because of the cheap beer and the decent wings. Not good!!! Just decent. I think the beer helps.   Long story short. If you have a party and want cheap cheapness... well then you've found... omg... an other cockroach just walked up on the bar! Are you absolutely kidding me!? Im seriously about to freak out and walk out. I don't care if I haven't paid. This is embarrassing!!! DO. NOT.  EAT. HERE!!!",

I called, the girl insists my husband did not say... White House Pizza, just white pizza. He then told her, no, I expressly told you white house in which she replies but I asked you if you wanted extra topping, in which he answered no, why would I, it's a specialty pizza? She again insisted he made the error, rather than even trying to say, maybe she heard him wrong? Then she goes on to say bring back the wrong one (cool with that) and get the right one, but we only charged you for the cheese pizza, $20 is alot for a medium cheese pizza? So I said basically you're charging us to come back to get the right pizza, all the while his $10 sandwhich is getting cold....terrible terrible service. The pizza was good. A little bland, VERY overpriced. But good.",

    "text": "I've been coming to this location since freshman year in high school (2000), it was our go to spot for half days. My husband and I walked in last night for a bite to eat and were greeted by cheerful, smiling hostess that sat us. Our waitress was young and also cheerful. We ordered a bakers dozen of wings, my husband got a pepper cheese steak sandwich and asked for extra cheese and explained that the last time he got it there was barely any cheese on it and was super dry, I ordered the chicken finger special (because I'm adulting like a pro). She brought out our drinks and after that nothing else seems to go right.   Our waitress basically focused on the big table she had in her section and us and another family that sat went through long periods of zero contact with her. No refills. Unable to ask for anything. I had to grab ketchup from another table because she was nowhere to be found. Our wings came out and they were warm at best and the skin was uncooked and gelatinous. So gross.  We waited for 5 minutes for our waitress to come back and she never did so my husband took the basket and went up front where our waitress and the manager were too busy flirting and play fighting to actually make sure their patrons were happy. They both just stared at him before even bothering to respond. They took the wings and my husband returned. The waitress eventually made her way over with our actual meals and said she removed the wings off the bill for us. My husband looked at his sandwich and asked if they put extra cheese and there was barely any on it and whatever was on it was translucent and she said she told them and they put 2 slices on each half instead of the 1 they normally put and that she didn't charge us for the extra cheese. Uh, thanks I guess? His sandwich was dry and seriously I don't know in what world they thought that was extra cheese. He literally told her to tell them to pile it on lol I had to wait over 5 minutes for her to come back so I can get the barbecue sauce for my chicken fingers.   Keep in mind we haven't had a refill this entire time. She finally brings my barbecue sauce and grabs my cup to refill it, completely ignoring my husbands empty cup. By this time we've been there for over a half hour and we're wondering where our wings are. My husband finally goes and finds the manager and asks him why the wings are taking so long and the guy told him he just assumed we didn't want wings anymore since my husband went back to sit at our table after initially telling them about the under cooked wings. My husband said it didn't make sense to make that assumption and the manager said \"so you DO want wings?\" my husband was irritated by this point and said of course he wanted the wings, why else would we have ordered them to begin with? We finished up eating our food and my husband is still waiting on his refill and I look over and watch our waitress sit down at a booth and chit chat with the guy that was sitting there. She didn't get up until ANOTHER waitress was walking around with our basket of wings looking for her to bring it to our table. She brings it, we ask for the check and to go boxes and that's when she grabs my husband cup to get it refilled.  Suffice to say, we won't be going here again. Other than the lovely girl that sat us and the waitress on the other side of the restaurant, the service was horrible. The manager didn't seem to know what he was doing and would much rather spend his time flirting with his young workers than actually doing his job and our waitress wanted to do everything BUT her job.",

It was impossible to find a place to park on the weekend. It's been on a steady decline ever since they left. I've heard the owner has family money and is well off. He must keep sinking that cash into the place to keep it afloat. No idea how else it stays open. He took over from his father and tried to expand the brand but failed miserably, obviously has no idea what he's doing. I go there for cheap tap beer from time to time and it's always a ghost town. I dont dare eat the food after noticing cockroaches on several occasions.  Some of the servers are cute and there's usually like 5 of them working for the 3 tables in the place so they're free to chat which is cool. I think the kitchen staff sits in the back and plays poker. Guy I sat next to the other day waited like 25 minutes for a pizza and a sandwich to go when there were 2 tables in there. Place is a disaster. Peoria location is the same story. It's sad to see a once great neighborhood spot take such a fall from grace due to incompetent management.",

The 2-star rating is due to the interior of the restaurant and the wait staff.  This place is in dire need of a make-over.  Like I said, 1980's, yet it is EXACTLY the same.  Except the chairs are ripped, there is no music, and everything feels old.  The waitress we had the last two times should be doing something else.  She obviously doesn't enjoy what she's doing.  Please Uncle Sam's - you've got the food.  But you aren't doing anything to attract new customers and improve the experience.  With little competition in the area, you should be the \"go to\" place - yet I have no desire to eat there again.  We'll stick with take out",

He never came. We got our food and everything was fine. Then we went outside and were talking to some friends that came in as we were leaving. There is a window to the kitchen outside. We witnessed the cooks eating in the kitchen. And then we witnessed a cook take off his gloves, reach into his pocket and pull out what I believe was Anbesol and put the medicine in his mouth over the fry station. He then grabbed the glove box and put new gloves on, didn't even bother to wash his hands. Most disgusting thing I've ever witnessed in a restaurant. They just lost our business for good.",

We hit Uncle Sam when nothing else sounds good either so about 2x per year. Today was that day. I regret it.  I ordered the mushroom pepper cheese steak with grilled onions and sweet peppers.  Over half of the steak in the sandwich was in-chewable gristle. About half of the normal amount of cheese. Zero on the mushrooms. Literally one bell pepper and they must have forgotten the grilled onions. I did however get 5 pieces of sweet pepper.  We ordered a large basket of fries to split....  I hate re-fried fries. All 14 of them were that way. I'm sure I will be back at some point holding out hope. There is a reason we walked in at 12:10pm and this sandwich institution was less than half filled.

Not to quick that I know it was not fresh and not too slow that I had to figure out where my food was.   I'm pretty sure they don't make the rolls in house but I'm guessing they are made fresh daily. My bread was still moist when it got to me.   The steak was sooooo great too! It was cooked perfectly, made right, and chopped up into tiny bits. The fries were also made fresh!   The happy hour deals are something to write home about as well! Great place! I'll be back for sure!",

My wife and I have been looking for a local restaurant where we could get good Philadelphia food and when we saw an ad for Uncle Sam's we were excited that maybe this could be the place.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  The insides of the sandwiches were fine but the rolls failed the test.  If you know what a good cheese steak or hoagie really is then you know that the roll is everything!   Sorry Uncle Sam, good try though.",

Waitress was slow to get to our table and the drinks got there slowly. We waited for 25 minutes for food that was cold and over cooked. The onion rings were burned, the sandwiches were barely warm and did not have the grilled onions as ordered. The manager was apologetic but we left without eating. We will not be back. The service and quality have steadily declined over the last two years. Sad.",

I have always enjoyed eating and having good times at uncle Sam's.  This last time I was there was a total disappointment.       To start the waitress could not get are drinks right and took three times to get the order right.  Then when I asked her to bring  table water, she went on to insist that the others did not need water.  Usually I would not make a big deal of this but when everyone at the table is drinking beer I think it is responsibility of the waitress to bring the water to the table regardless.        She then proceed to call the manager over to confront me of asking her to bring the water over.  I almost felt as I was getting imitated  but for the fact that he was not responsive with his own questions.          Never the-less if  are looking for poor service and a lack of management; uncle sam's on 32'nd and Shea is the place to go.",

The wings are what we came here for me and my bud like to try wings at new places. Saw the reviews were in the area. So let's go.  The waitress was sweet and provided great service. She did bamboozle us a lil hence only 4 stars hehe.  We asked how the wings were.  She replied they are awesome.  So we ordered 25 hot.  She pauses then tells us that their hot is sometimes compared to other's suicide.  I love a good hot wing but not lookin for heartburn. Tellin us she loves hot stuff and can barely easy like 3 before it becomes too much.  So we order medium.  They were really good and she did bring us sides of the hot sauce to dip and try. It does have a bite.  I am lookin forward to my next visit and gettin the hot.",

    "text": "I legitimately will never give this place another try again.   The first time we came here (boyfriend and I) we ordered a pizza, mozzarella sticks, and french fries. In the meantime, a waitress was bussing the table behind us and was extremely loud talking to another employee. And when I say loud, I mean LOUD. But that's not what bothered me. What bothered me is what she said... \"WOW! I didn't think they were going to tip me that much because they were black!\" Referring to the family at the table that had just left.  This is absolutely unacceptable, and I don't care what age, race, or what establishment you work in. Advice to the owners/managers- don't hire ignorant staff! Aside from that the food was just okay. Pizza was comparable to something that comes out of a frozen-food box, mozzarella sticks came out luke-warm (meaning the cheese was hard) and french fries were comparable to what you get in a grade-school cafeteria.   Second time we were here we came for what we thought would be a quick lunch. Serivce was so absolutely slow an incompetent. I ordered a garden salad (or whatever version of that is the small version) and the lettuce came out soggy and there was water at the bottom of the salad bowl. Talk about unappetizing. The whole meal service took nearly an hour and twenty minutes. So much for a quick lunch.. '  The third and last time I came here, I came with the idea that maybe \"the third time's a charm.\" Boy was I wrong. I ordered the dinner Ceasar salad, boyfriend ordered a small 7\" pizza with buffalo sauce instead of marinara, and we shared a side of fries.  My salad came out with the most unappetizing lettuce I have ever eaten in my life. The lettuce was wilted and nearly rotten, and seemed as if the romaine was cut in half (referencing the large pieces of lettuce). His pizza came out with barbeque sauce instead of buffalo. The waitress took it back, but when she did she took the tray and poked and prodded her fingers around the pizza to ensure that it was barbecue and not buffalo. Regardless of the fact that we didn't eat it that's still disgusting.   Aside from the terrible food and service, this place is dirty (and by dirty that's a compliment) and dingy and is nothing impressive to look at. No, I will not give this place another try. Sorry, Uncle Sam's.",

I was so disappointed in the food but more importantly with the owner Brett. He was defensive and interrupted me throughout the conversation. He did not care about me as a customer nor did he show any kind of understanding. For an owner to have such a disregard for his customers it shows how little he really cares about producing quality food. Don't go to Uncle Sam's. Let's all show Brett that you can't keep insulting your customers and stay in business. Horrible experience.",

First time I called and ordered a \"chicken steak sandwich\" with extra american cheese. Now in SJersey/Philly that typically means a chicken not Beef steak sandwich. The lady on the phone was actually rude She said that's not what it's called...it's a chicken sandwich. I said I know that's what I want. Then she said...well that's not what you said!  I know we're not in Philly and they have their own terms but that was just an ignorant way to handle it.   Then I get the sandwich and it's cut up chicken breast's...basically cubes. So when you eat it they tumble out. Why not chip/slice it guys? That's the way everyone I know did it for cheesesteaks. #beNice  Plus the service both times was very slow.",

Never told us her name or introduced herself. Ordered our food and it was bland and was not impressed with flavor.

    "text": "2ND UPDATE - MARCH 2018: WHY does my wife keep ordering from this place? Two nights ago they screwed up once again. Wings and fries is our go-to order. We always order the fries \"extra crispy\" because they are really great that way. When they're not crispy, they are average at best. It is always a 50-50 bet whether anybody actually makes them extra crispy when we ask for it. I was there to pick up our order... my brain said, \"check the fries to see if they were made crispy\". My patience said, \"no, don't: you're tired, you're not going to want to wait around for them to do it right.\" Sure enough, I got home and the fries were not done extra crispy. UNCLE SAM'S, THE CRISPY FRIES IS WHAT KEEPS US COMING BACK AND LITERALLY HALF THE TIME YOUR PEOPLE SCREW IT UP.  Then there's the wings. Two orders of wings, BBQ and Mild flavors. Both undercooked. The \"Mild\" wings, you could have fed them to a baby. No kick whatsoever. That reminds me, the wings are wildly inconsistent. Sometimes they are wet; sometimes they are dry. Sometimes the wings are plump and meaty. Sometimes they are neither. Even the celery and carrot slices that nobody ever eats, they were limp and inedible.   I've laid down the law: WE ARE DONE DONE DONE WITH UNCLE SAM'S.  I will gladly drive the extra distance to Oregano's: their wings are much better and they are consistently good. Also, I feel better about patronizing a business that doesn't treat its employees like crap, like the owner of this place does.  UPDATE 2-March 2016: Downgraded from 3 to 2 stars. The service is even worse than usual. To-go orders regularly screwed up. The food is so-so. The pizza is good but it's greasy and hilariously overpriced. We would always order wings and the quality varies greatly. About 1/4 to 1/3 of the time they are plump. The rest of the time they are scrawny. Yet more evidence of the owner cutting corners. Sometimes they come out drenched in sauce; sometimes they are dry with barely any sauce.  The wings at Oregano's are so, so much better.  Phoenix PD and DPS used to be seen here all the time, now you will never see them here, ever. Must be something to do with the owner's well-publicized bust for using illegal labor. Everyone I talk to has noticed the drop-off in parking lot traffic; it's seldom as crowded as it used to be.  The owner is also not someone who should be supported by the neighborhood, as he has chosen to put some really sleazy businesses in the nasty strip mall he owns behind the restaurant.  We kicked our Uncle Sam's habit (it used to be our go-to place when we didn't want to cook) and haven't looked back. Go down to Tatum and Shea and try Corleone's for pizza and subs. Better food, better prices.  =======================  UPDATE: Uncle Sam's seems to have their act together again. Unfortunate that the owner chooses to make this neighborhood seedy by leasing space to a pawn shop and a head shop. I've observed  him or his kid driving like an arrogant jerk, too. If my business' name was plastered all over my car, I'd be sure to be a courteous driver.  =======================  Newly re-opened after Sheriff Joe's raid, the 32nd St. Uncle Sam's is still trying to get its act together. Been here twice since the re-opening. Food service is rather slow. Both times the waitress did not pay enough attention to our table. On the second visit, our waitress was obsessed with cleaning and straightening the empty tables and practically ignored us once the food was delivered. She also forgot our drink order, we sat for 10 minutes until getting our beverages.  The wings come out VERY dry. We will remember to ask for them wet next time, this never used to be a problem.  I would advise you to wait until next month (it's August 2013 right now) until the staff and kitchen is back in its old groove.  This leads me into another topic, what bothers me more than these failures is the owner's very obvious tightfistedness. Use a coupon from the mailer? It better total at least $25.00 to the penny or you won't get your $5 off. Even if you mention at the start that you have the \"$25/$5 off with two drinks\" coupon, the waitresses will not tell you if you hit the $25 when you make your order unless you ask them to, and I don't trust them to do the math anyway. What's worse, none of the staff nor the manager has the latitude to honor the coupon if you fall a little short. One time we were denied use of the coupon because our order had totaled $24.95. A FREAKING NICKEL SHORT. We talked to the manager and it was very apparent it was not his call to make and that he would have gotten in trouble for cutting us a break.  On our first visit to the  re-opened Uncle Sam's,  the service was so painfully slow they should have - any good restaurant would have - comped us something. The drinks, the fries, something. Nope. That will never happen here.  Uncle Sam's we like your food but we're getting a little tired of making excuses for your shortcomings.",

I'm not asking for two different sauces, I simply want my toddler to be able to enjoy a few without having to order well over what the both of us would eat. Why can't you just set a few to the side? Shame on you guys for calling yourselves a family restaurant. UPDATED: You'll notice that the manager himself called me belligerent when he admits in his statement that he neither spoke with me nor even heard my half of the conversation. Belligerent over wings? No. I simply questioned the legitimacy of the denial and said that I'd rather eat elsewhere. Furthermore, unlike your ridiculous comparisons, what I asked of you would have taken absolutely no extra time and money from your business.",

Unfortunately before we were able to eat anything a cockroach crawled across the table. It was a very small cockroach but still it was super gross. The manager (who I must say was very nice as well) said that the bug spray people had just been there last night, which I totally understand can drive out the bugs. I get that. Yes, bugs are a part life and yeah ok a random fly might slip in through the front door; so while i might be super grossed out I won't totally write the place off (unless there are more than one) but still I feel like unless I'm eating food from a street vendor in Thailand bugs of any kind shouldn't be a part of my dining experience. Especially in Scottsdale, I could maybe understand that problem in like a waffle house in Apache Junction, but in Scottsdale? Really?? And come on cockroaches? How much worse can you get? They are so disgusting, even teeny tiny ones; and everyone knows that it's pretty much guaranteed that if you see one (especially during the day) there's probably a whole lot more lurking nearby.",

The atmosphere is Americanized which I love since everything around Central Phoenix caters to the Hispanics first then Americans.  Like I said the food is great, the reason only four stars is because the service sucks (Having to bring the waiter your cup for a refill every time I go there gets a little old) But other than that is definitely  worth a try!!!",

The wings are really good, espically if you ask for extra crispy. The cheese steaks are okay. Happy hour is very cheap. Overall its an above average sports bar.",

    "text": "There are two Uncle Sam's that I know of (and no, I am not talking about UNCLE SAM as in Big Brother!) and the one on Shea and 32nd street is the best.  I have eaten at the much larger restaurant on Shea and 92nd in Scottsdale, and IMHO, it lacks character.  The service at 32nd street is exceptional, and very, very fast (even when packed).  The food is good, with ample portions.  The only negative is that if you want french fries you have to order them as a side.  I think this is a shame, because while they are tasty -- they simply add a lot of extra $$ to the end of your bill.  Overall, my favorite choice there is the calzone (which has cheese and spinach inside).  I like that I can get a mini calzone and take half of it home and eat it for lunch the next day.  Tip:  go early for best seating.  Large parties are difficult, but they do a good job of seating you in the back.  Crowded at lunch and dinner.",

    "text": "I have been a regular customer for years, but tonight put me over the edge.  Walked in and got seated, waitress took my drink order while I was waiting for my friend. My friend arrived and placed his drink order, his beer took a while to get to table, we both ordered on separate bills, he ordered a 1/4 sandwich and I ordered a half sandwich, His sandwich came 10 minutes before mine, but they brought him a half instead of a quarter, She apologized and said she would only charge him for the 1/4 sandwich.  My order came the food was good but she never brought my side of hot peppers, I also did not get a refill on my tea.  When it was time to get the bill, she told my friend if he took the other part of his sandwich home with him the manager said he would have to be charged for it.  We were stunned, they would rather throw it away instead of giving it to the customer which you gave the wrong order to in the first place, also on his bill they put the wrong price for his beer, that was corrected.  This is not the first time in the last couple of visits that the service was off, or the wrong orders came.  I will take a long break before I go back into Uncle Sam's again, the same with my friend, we probably average going in there about 5 times a month, not anymore, I guess we should have requested one of the waitresses that we know are good servers there like Tiffany, we probably wouldn't have had a problem, but the wise manager I guess does not want our business anymore so we won't spend our money there for a long while.  Maybe they will get their act straight or either we'll see Jon Taffer in there soon.  P.S. On one other occasion I walked out because after waiting and not getting my drink after 12 minutes I decided to go somewhere else, So it is my fault for giving them another chance too soon.",

    "text": "They ripped us off! They placed a Val-Pak electronic coupon in which if you buy $40 worth of food, you receive a $10 credit. We ate our dinner, received our check, gave the electronic Val-Pak coupon with code and scan symbol and the Manager refused to honor it, saying the owner instructed him not to, and it had to be printed out. Nowhere on the coupon did it say that it had to be printed out and again it contained the OCR scan symbol and an alternate code for the cashier. They called the Police Department on us! Even the Manager acknowledged that it was misleading but his \"hands were tied\" by the owner. Bad experience.....left a very bad taste in our mouth about this owner and his business and we will never return.   I do also see several other reviews on this place that comment on the owners poor behavior towards his employees, and failure to make good on his \"special offers\".   I do also remember when the sandwiches in this place contained a lot more steak, and were considerably less expensive. The value has definitely gone downhill and it in my opinion the owner is getting more and more negative and hardcore in his attitude towards his customers and employees. Very disappointed in the downward turn.....",

    "text": "I have eaten at Uncle Sam's periodically since 1991. Today was my last time. We attempted to use a discount card that was purchased from a high school fundraiser. I handed the server the card when I ordered. Only after we were done eating she came over with the check and informed us that we couldn't use the card as the single Pepsi didn't count towards the \"food order.\" I had the manager come over and all he did was to argue and tell me that he would get fired if he gave the small discount as it was the \"owner's orders.\" I asked if they were willing to lose a customer over having the proper purchase amount but being just $2.00 short in the \"food cost.\" He essentially told me that if that was how I felt he couldn't do anything about it \"owner's orders.\" If they are so absurdly adamant the card should have been more legible as I couldn't read the fine print even with reading glasses, and the server should have informed me of the fact when I ordered not after the meal was consumed. Any business that is willing to lose a customer over a few cents doesn't deserve to be in business. (The soft drinks are a huge profit margin for them, so the inflexible policy is inane.)  On another note the sandwiches are quite good although I can easily make a better Philly Cheesesteak at home. The pizza and wings are merely average. If you want far better wings go, to Sardella's.",

If you know what a steak bomb is, you know how hard it is to find a good one out here in AZ. Grinder shops are rare but Uncle Sams offers the best steak bomb I have had in Arizona. It is hot, chopped steak, melty american cheese, grilled onions and raw, peppers, mushrooms, and hot peppers. Get the WHOLE. It is about 16\" of steak and cheese. If it wasn't so expensive I would rate it higher. If you like to pig out this is a great place to do it.",

    "text": "This restaurant was recommended to my father and I on our Spring Training trip to Phoenix (go Giants!... okay so they got slaughtered but that's ok).  We ordered the wings (hot honey) and pizza (white w/ 3 cheeses and tomatoes).  The food was delicious but not ridiculous as the car rental agent had gushed over.  We washed it down with a few hefeweizen's and my dad wished we could have gotten a drink but they only serve beer and a few \"box\" wines; we had chuckled at that too.  The waitress didn't know what any of the wines were called just that they were red or white and came out of a box.  Maybe steer clear of the wine if you wanted some.  My dad didn't complain but then again he doesn't ever complain so don't take that as any indication.  Overall the waitresses were stunningly gorgeous and the service was great, the food was better than average but nothing to actually log into Yelp directly after and rate a 5 star, and the decor was sports bar-ish.  There were lots of loud patrons and your normal crowded restaurant noises.  I'd have rated it a 4 star if I had been able to get a bar drink but everything else was good.  Maybe I'd have rated it higher if the rental car agent hadn't hyped it up in my mind before actually going.",

The wings were decent - but you can't mix flavors (ie 2 mild, 2 honey bbq, 2 suicide, etc) like at other joints. Now the steak and chicken sandwiches - worth it. A half is what most places label a regular size - and the whole - can feed 2-3 people. Hungry people. Which, I suppose it should be, for $12-14 a pop. I could see it being a fun place to hang out with friends. Parking sucks, as there are about 10-15 spots in front.",

The meat had no real flavor and the bread was kind of chewy and tasteless.   They had a large menu and selection of sandwiches and pizza.  Maybe I'll go back and try the pizza and wings.

My family has been going here for decades and still order take out often. I think the food is consistent and delicious. This place has something for everyone. It's not the healthiest but it's good. Perfectly greased and cooked each time. I have to get a side of fries every time THEY'RE CRINKLE CUT!!!!! I'm happy they added boneless wings to the menu (honey hot of course!!). Pizza is yummy but the grinders and sandwiches and cheesesteaks are where it's at. Anyway, I love Uncle Sam's and my family does too.",

Flash forward to 20 years later I'm still going back ordering pizza and have tried about every item on the menu. Uncle sams is the local spot where anyone and everyone can go to enjoy a great happy hour, watch a game, celebrate with your sports team after a game or just meet up for a great appetizer and drinks. From hot grinders, make your own pizza, huge salads, uncle sams has it all. It's a fairly small place and they haven't changed the look since I was younger and I love it. Gives it that hometown vibe of a local joint. When you first walk in you're greeted by all the local sports teams and young t-ball pics that uncle sams helps sponsor, then the gals up front greet you right away. There's not much of a patio area, only a few seats in the front but the misters work great! If you're looking for a great local spot to grab some even better food I highly recommend it here!",

I ordered for crispy fries with my grinder and Philly cheese steak grinder. I watched this lady get our drinks first then before she gives our order to the cook she got interrupted by somebody. I just knew since she didn't write down my order that she'll screwed it all up. Of course the cook will only do what he was told by the waitress. The cook can forget how I want my sandwich since there was no ticket. I want to know if this is something new that waitress don't have to write the customers order anymore. When I order my food I want mayo and ranch dressing on the sides, crispy fries, no lettuce. I just think that they still need to write the orders so the cook knows exactly what we want on our sandwiches.",

I'm 85 years old and my taste buds have over the years been replaced with the desire for the youth I once took for granted. But if there's one culinary recollection that brings a little flutter to this old man's heart it's the phantom taste of a Cheese Hoagie, that phallic masterpiece of untold proportions from Uncle Sam's.   It's huge.   They don't let me drive anymore but once in a while I want to jump in a cab and order one for old time's sake with with an extra side of the hoagie dressing. And eat it over the course of six days. It's that good. And that big. The hoagies are cold. The grinders are hot. The ingredients are slightly different for each but good god is this place good. The fountain drinks taste like they are mixed with really gross water but I gladly put up with it because the sandwiches are soooooo good. I've never really ordered anything else and can't speak to the rest of their menu but if you want a really really really good sub try Uncle Sam's.",

My wings were not any better, they were black on the inside with lots of veins, just gross, frys were cold, service was awful. Typicall teenager not interested in working. We asked for a manager and she came over and we told her about the food and she did take off the cheese steak but not the wings because I ate the 5 that were ok. I told her to look around this place Saturday at 7 o'clock and there are 15 people in here, there obviosly a reason this place is dead. Poor service and horrible food. Would not surprise me to see this place shut its doors. I remember this place always being packed and far better food. So save your time and money and go elsewhere.",

So decided to dine in the next time. The large pizza is plenty...really. The wings are above average. We will order them again, but not the best I have ever had. Beer is cold & the soda refills just keep coming. Lots of people having a good time both times we have stopped by so far.   Staff was very friendly & very efficient. They move you in & out quickly.

I needed a excuse to stop at Uncle Sam's and that was it....   I walked in about 1pm and was seated promptly(big word)....    The nice young lady brought me a Diet Coke and a menu.  She returned two more times to refill my drink and then FINALLY asked me when the rest of my party were going to show up.  I told her that I was it....  She then was somewhat embarressed and offered to buy me a beer or something, so I excepted the free Diet Coke.    I really came to Uncle Sam's to have a Meatball Sub but this time and the first time ever I ordered a pizza.    I waited................. and then she brought out a personal pizza for me....O-M-G!!!!!!     Now I know why people love this place!   It was incredible!!!!!    I cant even desribe it....  just perfect....  flavor was A-W-E-S-O-M-E....           so much so that I have been back one more time since then to have another.!!!!!!!

My buddy recently moved into the Tatum and Shea area so mountain bike rides at squaw peak trail 100 & uncle sams are back in the mix. Really the only good beer they have on tap is lagunitas. The rest is garbage coors/bud/miller from the 70s. The special grinder with grilled meat is amazing as always.   My only complaint is this is probably the only place to get  amazing wings in phoenix that doesn't have blue cheese dressing. I honestly don't know anyone who eats wings with ranch but my guess it's the same person that drinks coors/bud/miller. If your clientele thinks Budweiser and Taco Bell is good then I guess cater to them.",

Ooooh and the Chianti was DELICIOUS; best part of the meal hands down, wish I wasn't driving I'd of had another and would go back just for that :D Miranda works there and she is a rock star!

I ordered a Sams original toasted with some cheese fries. Wife ordered some wings and a small pizza. Son ordered a larger pizza and he was tickled to know they had pineapple! After a short wait out food arrived and we dug in. My new favorite grinder is the Sams special, I think that's what it was called. Lightly toasted and packed full of goodness. The fries were average, but good.   The wife's wings did not disappoint either. Her small pizza was mediocre and seemed to be missing something.   The sons 10\" pizza did not disappoint as well. He quite enjoyed it actually. All in all, it was a good experience with good food and good service. If you're in the area and jonesin' for some goood bar food or an awesome grinder, look no further than good ole' Uncle Sam.",

Got the Italian Grinders and to break it down, like my photo, the meat that was supposed to be ham and salami was the worst quality, with a funny chemical taste and we removed it immediately.  The lettuce was brown and soggy, the tomatoes were tough and the cheese tasted fake.  Even the veggie sticks they threw in were brown and wilted. But most disappointing were the wings; we like hot but these were uncomfortably hot and had a strange flavor.  We ate one of a dozen and it all went in the garbage.  Pass this place by!",

The grilled chicken breast salad is definitely worth the money and the Italian hoagie is tough to beat anywhere in the valley. What I appreciate the most is when I call in they can remember my order and they are always so nice and friendly when I come in and know me by name which makes me feel really good. I would highly recommend Uncle Sam's to anyone who wants a quick to go at home type of sandwich or any other item on their menu. We totally love the customer service we are provided with when we go in and pick up our order it's like We are family which is an amazing feeling.

They seem a little pricey for a full size sandwich but let me tell you these sandwiches are fantastic!  Soft white bread that is piled high with your selection of meats and dressing that makes the mouth water just thinking about it. These sandwiches are made with pride and care and are not to be likened to a Subway, Fire House or Jersey Mike's Speedwich with inferior ingredients.  You can barely get this mound into your mouth. Their wings, White Pizza, and array of New York fashioned eats kill. The beer flows easily here and the menu is pretty vast and will suit almost anyone's needs. The restaurant is nice and fashioned with plenty of TV's to catch your favorite sporting events.   Being right off of the 51 freeway at Shea lends to easy access and provides a quick way to get on to your next venue. They have been around for years and are a staple here in the valley! This is among my first choices when it comes to having an incredible bite when I'm craving a sub.  #Irishcatv2 #Vino2 #Vino2ultimate #vinosquared #rebelfoodandwine",

But the taste of the chicken tasted funny to me. Like that weird taste chicken gets. Don't know how to explain it, but that's all I eat is chicken so I feel I know when the taste of the chicken is good! And the wings weren't good.

First off, the calzone's are amazing, the outer crust is crunchy but not burned and the interior is filled with warm fillings of your choice ( I like spinich and pepperoni) and really good tomato sauce. The pizza, fries and wings are all very good and the fried zucchini is fantastic. The waitstaff have always been good to me and the prices are pretty decent. A sidenote, try the ranch dressing... really fresh and not too thick or heavy. Delicious.",

The food is amazing and very moderately priced...especially the honey hot bbq wings and pizzas (which we get everytime we come in). Last time we tried a cheesesteak and it was fantastic! Best I've had in a long time. The happy hour (5 dollars for a premium pitcher of blue moon or fat tire, or 4 dollar for domestic brews) cannot be beat anywhere in the valley.   The only thing about this place that is not up to our standards is the service.  The girls they hire here are inexperianced, slow and sometimes down right rude. Most of the servers we have experianced forget major parts of our order or forget about our table altogether. Once we were even told \"we better hurry up and finish because we are closing in 15 minutes.\" We had just gotten our food! My friend who was dining with us that night had frid zuchinni that she was in the process of eating and one of the servers literally grabbed it out of her hands and started boxing it up...while she was trying to eat! I've never experianced that level of ignorance and downright rudeness while dining out...ever. and I'm usually prety forgiving being in the restaurant industry myself. The girls just have no clue!   The food and great happy hour are sincerely the only things that keep us coming back again and again...although I wish it was an overall satisfaction.",

Pitchers are great too, I think it's $4 for domestic and $5 for premium! Blue Moon tastes so much better for that price! Haha  The girls that serve are all really nice, we made friends with one and love it when she's there. The patio is pretty blah, just some tables in front of the bar, but most of the people in our group are smokers so it's chill to hang there (especially because no one else sits out there.)   My one and only complaint, and the reason it only gets 4 out of 5 stars, is because they close at 11. That makes it somewhat of a pre-gaming spot for us, but with those prices it's not that bad! I know it's a restaurant primarily, but they'd get one he'll of a night crowd if they kept it open til 12 or 1 at least.",

Everything here is at least as good as you'd expect from a divey pizza joint staffed by chicks in short skirts. Not my thing, but they were nice enough and I hadn't noticed until one of the guys I was there with commented. Our group was a little rowdy that night, but this is a great place for shenanigans.  The pizza? Thin crust with that low moisture mozzarella that re-melts after they cut it. You know, the kind you have to be careful with, because all the cheese will slide off your slice if you don't cut it again? In other words, delicious and exactly right for this type of place. The sides? Fried food, wings, huge sandwiches.  The (reverse) happy hour prices are what makes this place amazing. $3 pitchers of beer, smaller portions of hoagies, rings, fried mushrooms, wings, a 7\" cheese pizza, all under $4 each! This may be the most awesome place in town for a weekend late night snack.",

What I'm pissed off about is that the management that seems to have no problem berating and belittling the servers and hosts in front of customers. I've complained, but the management seem to all be related to each other.   Chicken wings are good, not great. The have decent salads and a big selection of beers. Uncle Sam's runs great specials, too.   I don't love the pizza sauce, so I never get a pizza, stromboli, nor calzones. Other folks that I know seem love these items, so it must just be me.

My two female cousins used to torture me and I would end up in the bathroom crying every single time. That is until I called my cousin a hooker. Nobody knew what it meant, but it stopped their constant berating so it did the trick.  I cannot imagine a better happy hour. Pitchers of premium beer are $2.99 and their food is like $3. You can get a bud light on draft for $0.75 if you are into that sort of thing.  I always get the cheese hoagie (Cold) with the sweet peppers. Delish. Everything here is good, though, including the pizza, fries, and mozzarella sticks.   The only reason they don't get a five is because they have horrific service. Sorry, it's True.  Come. Enjoy.

The order taker was very friendly and the food was ready when expected and complete and looked pretty darn good.   Unfortunately we have decided that the third time is not the charm. The cheese steak although huge seemed fairly bland, the roast beef grinder looked great but was also bland, the calzone was a pasta sauce overload, and many of the wings were undercooked and raw, though the medium sauce had good flavor. The mushrooms are pretty good and the mozzarella sticks are frozen but good (heavy breading and good sized) but overall all of the \"fresh\" food was described as lacking any real flavor.  This echoes the last few times we tried and I think we forgot it was this lackluster. If the kitchen staff would toss in a Lil salt and pepper and some seasoning it might make a difference.   Positive : Customer service and front desk staff is doing their part. The bread is great. Wings had good flavor. Large portions. Negative: The food sounds good but doesn't deliver you to flavor town. The menu doesn't describe the items well. Raw chicken is never good.  My guess is that some better kitchen management is needed, or at least a tasting and quality assurance overhaul.",

    "text": "Its not a good sign when on a Monday night, the place is maybe 1/4 to 1/3 full.  (They used to be full all of the time.)  We have been coming here for years....loved the wholesome, all American feel and the quality food.   And we often get the pizza and wings to go.   To go is better.  The pizza was very good; We had a sausage/pepperoni combo and I'd give it a 5. (It's our family favorite pizza.)  The wings had almost no sauce and were very dry; although the actual flavor was okay.   I'm giving them a 3.  And although we didn't have any sandwiches this time, I will say that what we have had in the past was very good....love the hot pastrami!  I had mixed feelings about the service:    *  Our server was very nice and very good at checking back in with the table.   The beers were icy cold and she made sure we had fresh glasses to keep them that way.  She seemed a little inexperienced but had a good attitude.  I'd give her a 4+.  * I'm not a fan of the new outfits.  Most of the servers here looked like they belonged more in a go-go club in Vegas than serving at a neighborhood family spot....which is cool if you are at a bar in Vegas.    Hardly the 'all-american' look they used to have, and a turn off for the environment.  I'd give them a 0.  * Either the waitresses were very confused or the kitchen couldn't keep orders straight.  All 3 tables on our side (multiple servers) had wrong orders come out and/or had the apps and main course come out at the same time.   And the orders that were wrong, were way wrong.  (Although they did get the replacements out quickly.)  I'd give that component a 2 for the initial problem, but a 4 for the recovery.  Overall, I just don't like the new look.   We will continue to get the pizza to go but we can probably get better wings from Zipps.",

The past three times I have gone in to get dinner for my family with my son he was yelling at all of his staff, belittling all of them over issues that should have been discussed in private. Like seriously dude you are not Gordon Ramsay. He is very improper when it comes to the difference between the female and male employees and quite frankly I was disgusted, if he were to talk to me like some of the ladies he was talking to I would have kicked him where it hurts and filed a harassment claim.  End of story is all of the food and the kids working there are great even those that sometimes they make a mistake but their militant manager needs to get his mouth in check before they lose all of their guests! NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR YOU SCREAM AT YOUR EMPLOYEES WHILE TRYING TO EAT THERE DINNER THAT THEY ARE PAYING FOR! It's not just the food you pay for but service and the environment and he needs a new attitude or just to enlist in the military. Because I don't need my toddler seeing a man disrespecting women and men. All I can tell him is dude \"get in YOUR position\" as a manager or get out!  PS. I made a yelp account just to write this review because I was so disgusted by the manager.",

She didn't offer to remake it just stood there. On top of that she had an attitude when told her the food was prepared incorrectly like it was our fault they made it wrong, when we asked for drink refills apparently it was too much trouble. But she did get pleasant when she dropped the check off! Unfortunately, it was too late. It is too expensive to eat here for the type of service we received. Fast food would have been better!",

An additional mistake is not checking my order and catching it before I left but I ended up with a calzone which has ricotta cheese which I hate.  I had two bites and threw it away.  The crust is tasteless and somehow the steak tasted so bland outside of that fresh roll.  May not be back for awhile.",

She'd been talking about the wings at this place for a whole week since she first tried them so we decided to go so I could check it out too.  The building doesn't look like much from the outside and it'd be easy to miss so make sure you're looking closely!  It's a lot bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside which I was happy about because no one likes a cramped eating space.  We were greeted and seated right away which is always nice and the hostess was friendly.  Our server arrived quickly as well and was also pleasant.  My friend decided on the Honey Hot boneless wings and I went with Medium, we also wanted to try out the pizza so we split a 10\" Pepperoni.  The food came out pretty fast which was good because we were hungry.  The wings were a good size, perfectly crispy with the right amount of sauce and they had a great flavor.  The pizza was delicious as well.  We polished off the whole thing and I'm justifying it by telling myself it was small so it's okay.  My only tiny little pet peeve (and this is going to make me sound like a diva...) is that the water tasted like unfiltered tap water.  I hate to bring that up but Arizona water does have it's own special \"flavor\" and it just wasn't great.  With the exception of that though I loved everything about this place and I will certainly be back soon.",

Kids pizza was hot but really looked like the frozen Red Baron personal pizzas he eats at home, he didn't eat it.  Ate half of my husbands sandwich. For the 1st time in my life I sent my food back.  When the waitress brought out a replacement..with attitude, she had to inform us that she was a vegan and didn't touch meat...ever it was steaming and looked like a Uncle Sam's cheesesteak.  One bite told me otherwise.  The sandwich had absolutely no flavor, nothing.  No cheese taste, no onion taste. Meat was it, meat with no salt, no pepper.  Meat. I have loved this place for ever, I will probably give the Peoria location a chance since it's closer to our home, but Shea we won't be back!",

That being said, service is usually solid and I have started going for the hoagie grinder which is awesome. It comes toasted with cheese and bell pepper on top of sliced cold cuts. Pick up to-go a lot and it's always quick and delicious.",

    "text": "I am giving four stars because this place is pretty decent.  The hoagies are huge, the cheese steaks are delicious  and they have this menu called the Bail Out with mini versions of items off of the main menu, most of which are under $5.00.  My last visit was a little rough .  We found out they were training new staff so things took a little longer than normal.  I chalk it up to just being there on a bad day.  I will be back for more noms in the future.",

    "text": "Not impressed with the service or the pizza.    I was craving some wings and pizza and we were in the neighborhood. We have been here before because we loveee the wings and I thought we loved the pizza.  So we order a small pizza, wings and an appetizer, which was fried zucchini.  We let our waitress know, Aubrey was her name, that we wanted the appetizer first. 15 minutes roll around and no appetizer! Plus my husband was out of water and she hadn't come around. Finally a different waitress comes out with our order, minus the appetizer.  I mention to her we haven't received it and our waitress shows up just in time to hear this and basically scolds the other waitress helping out, like it was her fault that we didn't get our appetizer.  So we ask for a refill as she leaves, no problem, or at least we thought, 5 minutes into eating their suicide wings (which are by far the hottest hot wings I have ever tasted) my husband is really in need of that water. Finally I see her come around but with no water, she almost makes it to the table when I see that she realizes the same thing and she does a complete 180, and a few minutes later...daa daa!!! Water!!!  Other than the service completely lacking, and the pizza pretty blah, I enjoyed the wings and zucchini.  Unfortunately it did kinda ruin that satisfaction I was going for since after all I was really craving something more than what I got.",
