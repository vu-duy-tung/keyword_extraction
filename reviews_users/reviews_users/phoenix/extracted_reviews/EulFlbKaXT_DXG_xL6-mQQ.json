When food arrived we were short a side of rice  & bomber & glass empty.  Started eating... several minutes later my wife flags down the hostess.  The hostess ended up doing most of the work,  brought my the side of rice, found the server, asked him to grab us our beer.  If it wasn't for my wife's persuasion I wouldn't have ordered the extra drinks our of frustration.  From a business stand point the servers are killing the business.  This place needs a front of the house Manager with PRESENCE.  Servers need to to be involved and alert.  I'm sure extra sales are being missed.  Kudos to our hostess which \"saved\" the day.  I believe her name was \"Tia\".  She seemed to be picking up the slack all over the place. Once again over tipped by tipping out the hostess (more than the server).  Food.. jalepeno tail was great and the hamachi collar slightly burnt.",

Really, it was not a good experience, the place was not busy at all, but they were already out of Kirin Light, and they had no happy hour menu in place.    Went back last Friday night and fell in love with the place.  It was busy, there was an awesome happy hour menu to order from, and the specialty cocktails were great.  $2 off during happy hour!  Love their version of the Las Vegas roll, and will definitely go back for more happy hours in the future.... perfect price point.    Some people don't like the decor, but if you've lived in Arcadia for awhile, you know this building was a Pizza Hut years ago.  I think they've done a great job of turning the interior into a hip sushi joint.  Go and try it!",

After the calamari, we only ate because we were starving, and the terrible roll which they were kind enough to remove from the bill, we left.

How you answer is probably a good indication of how much you'll like this place.  The fish is fresh, however purists beware - a lot of it is smoked or cooked, and the vast majority of the rolls include 'krab.'   After taking a seat at the bar it was a waiting game for drinks, refills, our bill, etc. though our chef - Eddie - definitely knew what he was doing.  It's a good atmosphere but, as other reviewers have stated, on the pricey side. Dinner for 2, with 2 bombers, over $100, plus tip.  In the end we were full, but also reminded how much we miss Zen32.",

But the worst part was he kept blaming the sushi guys. He obviously didn't realize I could hear him talking over his mistakes. Hello! I'm sitting at the sushi bar right in front!! I didn't tip him and gave all my money to the sushi chefs. Own up to your mistakes! Don't blame others for your short comings! I can't stand people like that. Sorry dude but you are not better than the Mexican cooks when all you do is make drinks and mess up easy orders. I bartended in my day. Not that difficult.   Second visit our waitress was on top of her game but VERY snobby!   Today... I walk in with my daughter and boyfriend exhausted after a family funeral this week and my back is injured so I asked for a booth. She replied we only have high tops or the bar seating. I look over and say \"what about that booth?\" It was larger and as dead as it was in the place and minutes before happy hour ended she replied: oh, we save those for larger groups in case they come in\" in the snobbiest voice possible. After working in this industry I was annoyed. First of all, you don't tell your customer that. You say \"let me check\" or \"that area is not open\" or \"I don't have a server for that table\". Not, oh you don't have enough people with you to occupy that booth. Customer service! Where is it these days?! I was tired! I wanted to relax and enjoy my overpriced sushi! I have spent enough in that place to deserve a booth if I request one. Trust me it was needed! Long story short, I walked out and gave my business to someone else. I WILL NOT BE BACK! (Which is sad because I LOVE sushi and I live down the street.) If you are good with this type of service and frequent Scottsdale regularly, this place might work for you. But if you are like me who doesn't mind spending and splurging on good service but can do with out snobby stuck up people, you may have a similar experience so beware!",

I love watching him roll sushi, and he's sooooo friendly! There's a server/hostess that works during lunch time too, I wish I had caught her name, but she's seriously the SWEETEST!

Overall great food.   As for the vibe and such, it was pretty loud with the music.. kind of like the RA style.

The Brokers came through and made my early dinner quite enjoyable and affordable!   Service was spot on, everything came at a pretty rapid pace. There was music, but it wasn't a club or party atmosphere. I had my water glass filled just about 5 times during my 30 minute dinner. Kudos for staying on top of that, you need to stay hydrated in Phoenix or you will have a bad time.  I started with a chicken appetizer. Lightly fried chicken served with both terrryaki sauce and buffalo sauce on the side. The portion was solid for this discounted app and I enjoyed mixing the sauces and the chicken cubes in the rice. Nothing mindblowing or creative, but well executed and filling.  I tried a spicy salmon, and a spicy yellowtail maki style roll. Each roll was a generous 8 pieces, and packed full of fish. I liked that the fish was not pulverized, but rather cut in to cubes with a knife. The fish is paired simply with sliced cucumber.  I ended up with a very filling sushi dinner and app for well under 20$. That's a huge win in my book. I'll be back to try the other aspects of their happy hour menu.",

    "text": "So I've been to this place a few times already. Mostly ok.  The service is generally decent. The food isn't superb sushi but in that part of Scottsdale, its very touristy so a bit tough to find excellent sushi but I digress. So my daughter ordered the ahi tuna salad last night. I had the yakisoba. The hubby had the dynamite. Anyway, the yakisoba was ok but the flavor was heavy on the tamari or something... because the flavor felt unbalanced. My daughter was telling me something was off with her tuna. She asked me to try it and I did. I spit it out. Me thinks it wasn't tuna at all. It was definitely a red fish but it wasn't ahi. Whether management is aware if their ahi was actually ahi or another red fish...not sure but it was definitely wasn't sushi grade ahi.  So you are getting a red fish but without the wasabi and other sushi 'additives', it was very obvious that the fish was mislabeled. Hopefully,management is aware and looking into their fish distributor and taking a double-look to make sure they aren't getting the bait and switch because I would hate to see them actually aware they are purchasing a lower grade red fish versus the more expensive ahi tuna.",

I am a heavily tattooed mother of two and a proven professional who has worked in the industry before. Any business who feels that they can fire multiple employees for having tattoos that not only are not offensive but that they were hired with is clearly living in a world beyond fairness and reality. OWNER, stop living in the past and stop discriminating against good people. It's the service industry, what do you expect?",

    "text": "I'm  providing two stars based solely on the experience we've had prior to this evening (meaning we've had pleasant enough service prior to tonight to somewhat counteract the less than mediocre service we experieced this evening).   Tonight we were coldly greeted by \"Sidney\" who when I inquired as to the booth availability firmly stated that there were none available as she swiftly (and w/out agreement on our part) led us to a tall 4 top table. I politely stated that we would  sit at the bar for a drink & wait for a booth (which she said would be 15-20 minutes) but in reality only took about 5-10 (not complaining here as I realize restaurants always quote longer so as not to disappoint).   Sidney's idea of letting us know our table was ready was to approach us at the bar & state in an extremely unfriendly (almost burdened) voice that our booth would be ready shortly. This declaration was accompanied by what can only be classified as an annoyed head toss in the direction of the booth. Had we not had exemplary service at the bar by Hayden we would have just left at this point.  We proceeded to sit at the booth for over 10 minutes w/out a visit from a soul. My husband had to actually approach the (extremely unfriendly & unhelpful) hostess (Sidney) who was behind the bar at the time to inquire as to why we had not yet been approached. Sidney clearly had no idea that we had not yet been approached, yet was unapologetic upon realization that this was in fact the case. Let it be known that the restaurant as a whole was not whatsoever busy at this time.  Rather than spend much more time on this review, I will simply say this - we have been patrons of Sushi Brokers since it opened around 4+ years ago. We spend well over $100 every visit & visit on average 2-3 times/month. Our service had always been exemplary not only at the bar, but at the hostess stand as well. Having an individual at the helm & basically as the face of your restaurant that clearly would rather be anywhere but is an insult to your customer base & a drain on your repeat business. Too bad as it negatively impacts your amazing sushi chef team & bar staff.",

I explained to the server how I am severely allergic to Sriracha and how it cannot be within any of our sushi rolls. She was extremely kind and went to the chef to explain my request. She returned to our table and explained the chefs frustrations and did not want to make our special orders (we only ask to not include anything that contained sriracha) and need to choose something else from the menu. Then we suggested to the server to allow the chef to be creative and make up anything he thinks we'll enjoy. We were able to see the chefs nonverbal communication with the server and quickly noticed his attitude. They should really think about making the kitchen none visible if this is how they're going to behave. He made rude facial expression at me as we sat across from the bar and made our whole experience uncomfortable. The server again came to our table and suggested another roll. We simply gave up so we can hurry up and leave. PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE ESPECIALLY IF YOU INDEMNIFY  AS LGBT! Horrible experience!!!!",

The first time I stopped in it happened to be their \"grand opening\" even though it had been open a couple of weeks already.  The manager apologized because it was over a two hour wait and said to call ahead the next day and that she'd make sure we had a table.  Well, it would've helped if she had told us the telephone number listed on yelp and on their website is wrong!!  We went in the next day anyways hoping she'd stick to what she had said.  And did she even acknowledge us?? NO.  We were still seated after only about ten minutes.  The sushi is pretty good.  I also had the salmon teriyaki, which was very salty, but the side of veggies it comes with was pretty good.  Overall it's nice to have a sushi spot in this neighborhood and the happy hour specials are good, but for a regular dinner or meal go somewhere else.",

As I walked in, I was greeted by a charming hostess with a friendly smile on her face. Seconds after being seated, I was greeted by a helpful young man named Evan. He chatted with me for quite awhile trying to help me decide what I was going to order. Later ,I found out he was the GM. He was one of the most helpful servers I have ever had. Evan took his time and didn't just grab my order and run off to another table. I felt very welcomed and comfortable. As I waited for my food, which came out in a very timely manner, I was checked on by multiple servers. It felt very refreshing to know that they took their time to make sure I was satisfied, even though I wasn't their customer. Even the sushi chefs chimed in to make sure I was pleased with my meal. To top it all my food was delectable. My overall experience was excellent. I have been back many times since this. Amazing food, attentive service, and great music made my experience fantastic. Sushi Brokers is definitely my new sushi hot spot. The upbeat atmosphere and the awesome employees are nothing short of excellent!",

I've been three times in the weeks that they've been open and have brought a hopeful attitude each time. And each time I've received pretty good service (forgiving the newly-open-restaurant learning curve), but have been a little let down when I receive the food. Sushi is pretty standard, but about 25% more in price then you would pay at other, more creative independent operations. Most of the rolls contain cooked fish rather than raw, and there's nothing too exotic on the menu...kind of a beginner's sushi place. Cooked food was pretty good, pan-asian (in the same way that PF Changs is \"pan asian\") but nothing particularly stands out. Atmosphere is kind of the problem...it is a little loud and tries to be clubby, despite the aforementioned 1980s Pizza Hut  rebuild. Also they only serve the big, 22 oz Japanese beers, so if you want a beer, youd better want two beers. Definitely not kid friendly...no boosters or high chairs, no kid menu the one time we did bring our little one. All in all a decent option in the neighborhood, but if you are looking for something authentic or creative, move on to the better, lower key options in town like Hana, Hiro, or Yasu.",

Okay big deal, no wasabi, but I specifically asked the guy if it was in there. Drove 15 minutes back to the restaurant to get the wasabi and the hostess greets me by saying \"Is this what you're looking for?\" Umm no that's not what I'm looking for that's what should have been in the bag the first time I asked for it 30 minutes ago. 45 minutes later once again I sit to enjoy my dinner. The sushi taste exactly like what you would expect to find in the desert. By no means was it fresh and the fish had a sour smell to it. I ordered the hot lips roll. Presentation was sloppy. Literally looked like someone vomited on top of my dinner. Horrible experience. I hope I don't get sick. Try Sushiholics on 40th st. and camelback!

Some of the HH deals weren't that great (like only $1 off edamame) but other deals were really good (like $4 off calamari appetizer).  We actually didn't end up ordering off the HH menu and just ordered sashimi salad.  It was $15 but came with a LOT of fish on it, so I felt it was a pretty good value.  It was definitely filling enough for me.  I enjoyed the greens that it was served on and the light salad dressing.  I would order that again!",

Initially, I was skeptical because I am very particular when it comes to Sushi, but I decided to give Sushi Brokers a try and I am so glad I did.  Unlike most sushi restaurants that have very limited seating at the bar, Sushi Brokers understands it's more fun to watch the chefs arrange their delicious creations and  have plenty of seating at the bar.   My lunch companions and I feasted on Cowgirl Sushi Rolls, Crunchy Rolls, Surfer Rolls, Lollipop Rolls, and spicy edamame. All our entree's were fresh and absolutely delicious.  My favorite was the Cowgirl rolls which are made with Yellowtail, layered on top of a Sushi roll, with Spicy Hot Sauce on top.   The sushi was fresh, delicious and artfully presented. The atmosphere inside Sushi Brokers is inviting and, a bit upbeat. The service at Sushi Brokers can be a little slow however, we enjoyed our visit and the clientele  are very friendly. You can't go wrong at Sushi Brokers.",

A week ago I was dreaming about their Hawaiian Roll after spending 14 days in New Delhi suffering from traveler's diarrhea. I was like, I can't wait to get home and eat food that doesn't make me shit my pants. (I didn't actually shit in my pants, but it makes for a better story). All these people complaining sound so annoying. Like your palate's really all that refined. Stop pretending you're Anthony Bourdain eating at Sukiyabashi Jiro. You don't know shit about sushi and you probably don't even know who Jiro is.   P.S. Anyone who hopes a restaurant goes up in flames has zero grasp on reality and needs a hobby. Might I suggest taking up sushi making at home?",

So i waited until they bagged the order and handed the order to me to say that the order was wrong the manager got irate with the chef there chef remade the order the manager takes the order 7 minutes later throws the food in the bag and slid the food to me and walked off no sorry no thanks no anything. I asked for the number for the gm on the way out the door at this point i decided i was not going to eat the food. Got him decided to get ready for bed and received a call back from the gm who was nice and agreed that the service was unacceptable. Feeling better i decided that rather than discard the meat i would eat. Popped the entire piece of  roll in my mouth chew chew go to swallow and i gag.. there had been a full piece of plastic rolled in the roll.. pull the plastic out..decided this can't be real popped the second piece in my mout yep u guessed! There was plastic there two they measured at 3 inches wides by 7 inches long so these was not scrapes this was wrapping from the seaweed i assume i texted he pictures to the gm having had his number and he was not happy. But that does not really help. I think this is really an awful situation. While he did say he would return my 20 that i paid for the sushi roll plus tip. I feel like there should be much more done in this situation. If you look at the reviews they are failing miserably.",

I came in and ordered the sashimi salad and I felt like it was drenched in the vinaigrette sauce. A bit too saucy for me..  Also the price is way too high for the quality of the sushi.

    "text": "Updating my previous review. This was my 5th or 6th visit to Sushi Brokers at 44th and Indian School. It's obviously under new management because I never had any problems on my previous visits.  I'll start by saying that after what just happened to me and a friend of mine, I will never ever ever be back. I sure hope everybody reading this does not go there either.   I just ordered a rainbow roll and edamame while waiting for my friend to arrive. The waiter told me that even though the rainbow roll is not on the happy hour menu it will ring up in the computer as a happy hour roll. So I asked him how much it costs at happy hour prices. He told me $14. I looked on the menu and it costs $14.50. Those are NOT happy hour prices! He lied.  My roll arrived and for that price I was expecting a pretty roll with sauce on top and a nice array. The manager, Devin, stopped by and asked, \"How's everything?\" I said, \"expensive. $15 for a  four(8) piece roll is expensive.\" He said, \"It's the quality of our sushi that you won't find anywhere else in the valley.\" I've eaten sushi all over the Valley. It wasn't like this was my first rainbow roll. Duh! I told the manager that Moto Sushi serves the rainbow roll on a pretty plate and has it arched and colorful like a rainbow with sauce dripped on top for under $11. And Mido Sushi has all you can eat sushi with sashimi, free soup, salad, edamame and ice cream for $20!!  He said,\"Well this is Sushi Brokers!\" and walked away with a snotty look on his punk face. Poor baby couldn't take the competition?!  My rainbow roll had four (8 tiny) pieces thrown on a plate...no sauce, presentation or anything. I took a picture and will post it for your viewing pleasure. (Take a look zzzzz).   By the time my friend arrived, I had already eaten my tiny roll, but was planning to order another off the happy hour menu. I showed her a picture of my rainbow roll and told her the price. She was shocked! While we were talking, the manager came over, could clearly see that we were talking, and asked her if she was ready to order. She said she wasn't ready and we continued to talk. A few minutes later, the manager came back and told us that we needed to be on our way. I said, \"Be on our way? You are kicking us out?\" He said, \"Yes. You don't come into an establishment and complain about the prices when they are clearly marked on the menu.\" Say what??!! Since when are clientele are not allowed to discuss prices?!! My friend said,\"You mean I can't order?\" He said no, handed me the bill and told us to hurry.  I got great satisfaction in writing \"Eat Shit!\" in big letters on my bill and did not leave a tip. I tossed the bill on the counter and walked out.  $19 for a bowl of edamame and a very small rainbow roll that was by far NOT the best sushi in the Valley! As if!! We both left hungry and I felt as though I hadn't eaten anything.   I will NEVER step foot in this place again and do not recommend that you do either.",

Onto da foodz -   Some quick background, I recently moved back from the Bay Area so any time I venture to a sushi restaurant in Phoenix (which I endearingly refer to as 'Desert Sushi'), I approach with caution.  We ordered four rolls, and all four of them had imitation krab in them. ALL FOUR. It was like I was eating the same roll over and over. We had held on to one of the menus in case we wanted to order more, so I inspected it quickly and took my tiny pencil and marked all their rolls with imitation krab listed in the name. It was at least 50%. In fact, one of the rolls that we ordered didn't have fake-crab-mixed-with-mayonnaise in the ingredients but it was still in our roll!   We ordered a couple more and I confirmed with the waitress that these rolls did indeed NOT have krab mix. These were much better. All in all everything tasted 'fresh' just very bland.  The cocktails were very sweet but not awful.   Even though I think they deserve two stars, I am giving them three because I don't want to hurt local businesses, and also, many people who go here just wouldn't know better. Can't miss something you've never tried!",

    "text": "Went with the boyfriend this early evening. We went for Happy Hour. It's noisy, and busy, but the staff were plentiful and friendly.   The HH menu of rolls and food was, of course, more limited than their standard menu, but still more varied than most sushi places during HH.  My boyfriend ordered his standard California Roll, and Philly Roll, both of which were decent sized, and only $4.50/ea.  I ordered the Las Vegas roll, which was $8.50, even during HH, which surprised me. Every other place I've been during regular hours the LV roll was around $9, so I didn't feel like I was getting much of a deal there.   I like a lot going on with my sushi. Lots of texture, and complimentary flavors, which is why I usually order a tempura'd roll.  I was surprised to taste the Philly roll and find it really flavorful, with a bit of spice to it that I don't normally encounter. The LV roll was pretty standard for that roll.  Tasted good, but didn't knock my socks off or anything. But, since it's one of my \"old faithful's\", I'd order it again here, just not at the regular price (around $13 when it's not HH).    After that, we were still hungry, so we decided to order 2 more rolls. The Diamondback roll was new to me, and seriously yummy. Definitely a new favorite. HH price was $8.50.  The other roll we ordered wasn't on the HH menu, and was $16.50(!), but it sounded interesting, and when I saw someone else's order of it, it looked amazing, so I splurged and tried it.  It's called the \"Hot Lips\" roll.  It's really spicy, with a lot going on. My boyfriend thought it was a \"once in a while\" roll only because of the spicy kick, but I didn't think it was too hot at all (but, I grew up here, so I'm used to spicier food).  The roll is sliced and laid flat on the plate, and all of the pieces are topped with a mix of krab, jalapeno, and spicy mayo.  AWESOME.    The staff was very friendly. We sat at the bar, so there was always a server around, and none of them hesitated to refill our water glasses when they saw us getting low. We got asked by at least 3 of the staff how our food was, and we just felt really taken care of.   The cost for dinner for edamame, and 5 different rolls (we're water drinkers, so no drink charges) was only $48.  And, bear in mind, yes, it was happy hour, but one of the rolls we ordered was $16.50, so, we thought that was a very decent price for the quantity and quality of the food.   The place was loud, between the music and the customers, so I wouldn't go if you're looking for a nice, quiet dinner, but for a fun night out with good food, I'd recommend it in a heartbeat.",

I made it there right at the end of happy hour (not just for drinks, but for sushi as well). My waitress was super nice and said she would charge my dinner at happy hour price even though it was technically passed the time. The sushi was good. The service was great. The place was nice.

The Hot Lips roll is the best roll I've ever had anywhere.  The wine by the glass selections were decent and my friend said his blood orange margarita reminded him of his trip to Rocky Point the weekend before.   4 starts instead of 5 because it was fairly loud inside when the restaurant when it was full and we had some slight service issues. Overall, the best bet for great sushi in the area.",

First off, the restaurant has a cool, hip vibe with good music playing in the background. As for the food, the sushi is consistently good and fresh.  Our 2 favorite rolls are the \"lollipop\" roll and \"surfer\" roll which are both on the happy hour menu. The lollipop roll is a cucumber wrapped roll with tuna and the surfer roll is topped with shrimp dynamite.  Besides the good sushi, this place has great service. Everything from our two servers, Aaron and Will, going above and beyond to ensure that we were well taken care of, to the manager periodically checking up on us as well. Very personable and knowledgeable of the menu. These are reasons why we continue to come back for happy hour sushi.",

    "text": "I was so excited for the long awaited Sushi Brokers to open in Arcadia.   I fully expected it would be my new local \"go-to\" sushi place, as it is just a few blocks from my office and from my home.      We've gone for lunch and have hit it up for evenings on several occasions.   Overall, the food is good and the service is quality.  The only qualm I have is on the price.  Very few lunch specials ($15 Bento box) so it's definitely not somewhere we can go frequently as it is definitely beyond my lunch budget.   They do have a good happy hour, but otherwise the prices are higher than other places around.    Nonetheless - the important part - FOOD!  The sushi seems very fresh and they have some great, creative rolls to try (Cowboy, Cowgirl).  Tootsie roll is always a favorite.  Spicy tuna roll is my favorite, and they definitely do this one very well - great flavor and just the right amount of heat!  The Bento box with sushi is a good and filling lunch option (with miso soup, veggies, an orange).  Tuna Tataki was a great choice.   The sashimi is good, but the portions are on the smaller side in comparison with other sushi places in the area.   Food: 4 stars Service: 4 stars Price: 2 stars  Overall:  3.5 stars  With that said, happy hour is definitely the time to go enjoy Sushi Brokers.   There is regular happy hour until about 6:30, I believe, and then a reverse happy hour that starts at 10 pm.  I just wish there were better lunch deals or locals had discount options - or even daily specials would be great.   Until then...expect Biltmore or North Scottsdale prices and plan accordingly.",

This time, we tried the pineapple rolls. I really liked them. They have a spicy kick to them and the pineapple sauce was delish! Seemed more like a pineapple salsa than sauce, because it was chunky.   We also had the Uppercut wine, which tasted much better than it smelled lol. And we had California rolls. We both left full and the bill was $51 including tax and tip, so overall not bad. I like this spot.",

It started out with our waitress answering many of our questions with \"I don't know\" then besides grabbing our order and bringing out our drinks she was nowhere to be found until she brought our check. The edamame was by FAR the best part of the meal, which is why I give this 2 stars instead of 1. My wife ordered an $8 Moscow Mule that probably did not have any vodka in it at all. Our sushi was at least edible but not worth the price one bit. $6.50 for an alright California roll is not good and $7.75 for an Alaska roll with poorly cooked Salmon, BAD. Our other rolls were decent but again, way overpriced. Then taking a step away from the food, they were playing not that great of music and it was much too loud, but that is obviously my opinion so you may like it. But the kicker, despite the World Cup being played they had CANADIAN FOOTBALL on their TV's! Why?! Lastly, we were not even thanked by our waitress or the hostess as we left, not even a goodbye or have a nice night. Save your money.",

Sadly, the service had plummeted over these past few years, most markedly this year. I just got off the phone with the manager, Hayden, after yet another take out order was messed up. I kid you not, the last 6 or 7 take orders have been messed up. Each time my husband or son says \"this is the final one, we aren't going back\". We've relented because of convenience, but no more! I'm tired of being charged for items not received, or the wrong sushi being boxed up. Tonight it was missing calamari, last time it was receiving Smelt Roe instead of Salmon Roe, another night it's missing rolls entirely! The service inside isn't much better. Miso soup comes before the entree - not sure how hard that is since its pre-made, but half the time its forgotten until we remind our server. Whatever is going on there, it starts and ends with management. Sadly, we won't be returning, but taking our business to Sushiholic. We haven't had any issues there!",

    "text": "Decided to give Sushi Brokers a try today and was pleasantly surprised. The reviews are right, the sushi is not cheap - $14 for 5 pieces of nagiri, but the quality is impressive. I also got a lunch bento box and did not regret it. Whatever they cook their vegetables in is delicious. The katsu wasn't greasy or soggy. It was scrumptious. I may not run back for their sushi, because I'm cheap, but at $9 their bento boxes are well worth it.  In regards to service, the waitress was very intensive for being the only one in the restaurant. The sushi chef may be a little slow, but if you watched him you'd see how meticulous he is - every brush of the knife was deliberate. Worth the wait.",

Then she forgot some orders. The chefs are all slow and they were talking and laughing. Like it's flu season keep your mouth shut and not laughing over the food. food was also brought out item by item. I waited for 10 mins for my food to come. Then on top of that my eel was cold. Not cool. I'm never going to this place again. Just pass this place.",

    "text": "I'm determined to try every sushi place in the Phoenix area and with Sushi Brokers having a happy hour and a reverse happy hour how could I pass them up?  A spacious restaurant, that was pretty empty for the lunch time happy hour, I decided to sit at the bar. They have a good assortment of sushi rolls, appetizers and discounts for alcoholic drinks available for happy hour. Since I shared lunch with another, I got to share apps and sushi rolls, no drinks this time around.  For appetizers, Vegetable Tempura and Calamari and for rolls we got the Spicy Tuna (my go-to) and a Crunchy Roll.  Vegetable Tempura- thick, crispy battered vegetables (sweet potato, zucchini, mushroom and broccoli) Calamari- tender rings of squid, lightly battered and seasoned served with a Buffalo Wing type dipping sauce. I thought the dipping sauce was very zesty and tangy and would've preferred something else. Spicy Tuna- typical, 8 pieces to this roll and good tasting Tuna with a balance of heat and warm flavor of sesame oil. Crunchy Roll- Tempura shrimp with imitation crab meat, topped with avocado and unagi (eel) sauce. I thought this roll was a bit too mushy or wet in texture. The mouth feel was too soft for my liking. I don't know how this roll cost way more than the Spicy Tuna as it wasn't as good.  Service was kind of lacking/awkward, as we were welcomed from one server who told us to let him know when we were ready who later disappeared for 15 min, from ordering from the sushi chef behind the bar and had another server take care of our checks and water, but good quality food none the less for the price paid. Thank you based happy hour (TYBHH).   Will return for happy hour and for the Lucky Buddha Beer I saw available on the menu.",

    "text": "The first time I went with a friend, the food and the service was good, but the sushi is a bit over priced, so we ordered the bento box, not bad and nice size for the lunch portion.  Since i got pretty good 1st impression about this restaurant, so i decided to go there again.  The second time I went there with my wife and my 1 yr old baby for lunch.  Same as first time, the server tell us to seat wherever we want, but I looked around, they have all high table, high bar table, even the lower table are raised.  I asked the server if they have a high-chair for my baby and they said No!  Really?!  We end up to leave the restaurant and eat somewhere else.  No high-chair means can't dining with infant, no regular table means not accessible for people with wheelchair.  I just can't believe now a day still have a restaurant that doesn't have the equal dining experience for all people....not comply with ADA means pending to get sue!  Hope they could correct / improve these issues...  Third try...ordered teriyaki chicken bento, I am not sure am I eating chicken or pork, that pieces of meat so dry, tough and salty!  The stir fried veggie also very salty and the rice is cold and hard!  I only ate a little bit then can't eat any more, besides the orange, the other food just not eitable.  Decided not to come anymore, wasted my money....and the way they prepare the food, it is totally wasting it.  They should try their own food before serve it to the customers!  Terrible!!!",

I admit that I waited for this review because I had mixed feelings of posting an experience like this; however  I decided I believe it's important to know where you spend your lunches and/or dinners and where your money is going.    While we were sitting at the restaurant sharing wine with the two owners, one of the owners stated that he \"hated ni**ers, Jews, spics, muslims, and the gays.\"  We were appalled.  We got up and walked out and I have to say quickly before I couldn't hold my tongue.  How dare anyone say something like this.  If you fall or don't fall in this so-called category, pass this place up.  This is awful for the community and encourages hate.  100% verbatim from the owner's mouth - this is where your hard-earned dollars go to.  I'm disgusted.  I will never return and I will continue to share this experience.",

Lo and behold, the girl who answered the phone,who was very sweet, told us that the owner is an alcoholic who hates children... I was shocked that she would openly share this, and told her so. She laughed and said that he has instructed his employees to openly let clients know that he hates children and they are not welcome in his establishment. Apparently he's fine with his employees sharing that he is an alcoholic as well. Suffice it to say that we will never again step foot in this restaurant. Karma is a bitch!",

Their calamari was delicious! Along with all of their freshly made sushi. However, the best asset of Sushi Brokers was their customer service. They couldn't do enough for us.

The rice in the bento was dry. and stirfry that accompanied it was only seasoned with soysauce and pepper so ended up being a little too salty.  The miso soup tasted like salt water.  It wasn't too salty, but salt was all you can taste because it had little else.  The side salad in the bento was just shredded cabbage... that's it. No dressing...  The sushi was nothing special.  It was merely eatable.  This would have totally been fine if the price matched the food, but it didn't so I felt like I was ripped off.  For 15 bucks I expect something better than dry rice, soy sauce stirfry veggie, plain cabbage side salad and a sub par roll of sushi.  It's the equivalent of Kyoto Bowl, but at a higher price.  Also the service was extremely slow.  This would have been forgiven because our group was about 15 people, but the restaurant was far from packed.  Half of the restaurant was empty.",

I tried the cowboy and the surfer (i think?). I'm pretty sure the surfer is the one with a bunch of crap splattered all over it. Apparently, it's really popular. I felt like I was eating soup! Good place to go for people who are new to sushi. My manager, who is afraid of sushi, liked what he had.",

We both ordered sushi lunch - about $11 or so - comes with miso soup, tiny salad, 3 pcs of nigiri and California roll. We don't like California roll so we asked the server if we could get tuna roll instead with additional $.  First of all, the server did not tell us how much the additional cost for the substitute, then they just added the cost of an order of tuna nigiri ($6.50) for two lunches. I think it's a bit too expensive from California roll to tuna roll substitution ($3.25 each up). We could have just kept the original California roll and order the tuna nigiri additionally for the same price. Each of us ended up paying over $17 for soup, tiny salad, 3 pcs of nigiri and tuna roll with tip. We didn't even get full. Food was ok but ... just OVERPRICED!  The atmosphere was good but ... It was my first and last time there.",

Service was quick and friendly, and the food overall was very good.  Prices are a little too high, though, considering the fact that most of the fancy rolls are $15 and you can get equivalent quality at other places for cheaper.

    "text": "Having regularly gone to Sushi Brokers for the past two years, it seemed time to write a review.  I am not interested in a sushi place that is more about the drinking than food. They have a large menu of sashimi, hand rolls, maki sushi, traditional meals and appetizers.  One of the few restaurants that serve Rombauer Chardonnay by the glass for only $14, and I regularly upgrade to real crab vs. krab.    A few months ago, there seemed to be a decline in service quality, but tonight Hayden was our waiter and he is amazing!  He's so rare in the area, that I asked him if he was part-owner.  He has that sixth sense of a waiter that anticipates your needs, makes you feel like a regular and times everything perfectly.  4 stars for the sushi and 5 stars for Hayden!",

Waitress came by once and didn't refill our water. A male (not sure if it was manager) came by and did it. After we were done eating she took our plates but never returned with a check. Waited another 5-7 minutes and flagged her down to bring check. (Mind you there was still only 3 people in restaurant) finally the same guy that refilled our water came and picked up check to check us out. All while waitress stood at bar talking to another girl. Just wish she was a lil more attentive. Wouldn't be going back again.",

First off the \"Damn Good\" was money! The \"Chimichunga\" was a close 2nd for me and the tootsie was outstanding as well! They also had discounted drinks and i had a kirin light with sake. boring i know, Michelle had the Blood Orange Margarita and she thought it was Super smooth and went down too easily. \"It could be a lot of trouble\" was her exact quote.   The staff was also quite good and attentive. The food arrived with no problems even though the restaurant was quite busy. The bartender was very friendly and was able to carry on a conversation while still making drinks. Plus she reminded me of Megan Fox, so thats a plus! They also have a reverse happy hour so you can get your sushi on, later if thats what you are looking for.",

We came for lunch so we were presented with the regular menu and lunch specials and of course the sushi menu. Fabulous Kendal our server was not only attentive..... so up beat and friendly.  Started with  Kirin and the chicken club roll and the scallop roll. Oh dear lord they were both amazing.... but that Club roll was spectacular!!  And the sauce with it was a mayonnaise/cilantro with a drizzle of Sriracha! I could just use that on everything!!  Then we had the bento box lunch specials. I had the Chicken Katsu box and Husband had the Tempura Combo.  Both very good for the price $9 and $10 respectively. They were supposed to come with miso soup but we didn't get it and honestly... we didn't care. The food was plentiful and delicious!!  I honestly can't wait to come back!!

The las vegas roll was honestly intimidating on paper (who came up with these ingredient combinations lol) but it was so delicious! I wasn't sure what to expect, but the texture and flavor just works haha. The deep fry was crisp and thin, with no oiliness; the salmon and avocado at the center was YUM; and the oyster sauce is literally addicting so we asked for a side of it.. We also got a tuna roll for a simpler option and it was a refreshing bite to pair with the las vegas roll :) There's a closing happy hour, so we got a nice discount!",

Went in for a late lunch last week and thatcrossed over to happy hour. We sat ourselves after no one acknowledged we were at the door. Sat in a booth with a filthy table and someone finally came over to get a drink order and realized the table was dirty. They wiped down half and walked away? We wiped down the other half with baby wipes.   We ordered some sake bombs. Received our beer but no sake. Sat there for about 5 minutes while what seemed to be the ONE waitress ran around the restaurant frantically. A young man who appeared to be a bus boy came over to our table for some reason and stood there looking confused. We asked about our sake and were told the sake machine was warming up.   A man (I would assume the manager) brings over our sake and apologizes for the delay and states they are really hot. They weren't just hot they were SCORCHING. We asked for cups of ice to put them in to cool down and had to use a napkin to hold the glass. It was terrible pouring boiling sake into cold beer. When I stated it burnt my fingers the manager kind of chuckled? Odd.   Sushi order was a mess. We were given things we didn't order, given the wrong items and sushi looked sloppy as the rice was falling apart.   Our waitress was a nice young lady but at this point we just wanted to get out of there. I used to like sushi brokers but it seems to have gone downhill.   Wouldn't recommend. Visit Sushiholic 2 minutes down the road for fresher sushi, better service & warm, not burning hot sake.",

Service has fluctuated as the staff goes thru turnover but that's to be expected. However, food and quality has never dipped. I no longer live in Arcadia but I sure do miss this place. Hand rolls are awesome! Super tasty. I have about 7 different specialty sushi rolls I rotate thru. What I do want to highlight is the crab rangoon. On happy hour, what a deal, best crab rangoon this Asian American has had since I can remember. And their fried rice, phenomenal. I like the vibe, not stuffy, just nice relaxing casual vibe. Service is primarily younger and hip, so if you're into it, great. For the most part service is great. When I'm dining solo I sit at the sushi bar and the people working it are very friendly. This place is one of many reasons I miss about living in Arcadia.",

We just missed their Happy Hour specials which was a bummer because they have really some great deals. Next time we'll have to get ourselves together earlier!  Ambience wasn't too fancy but still nice enough. The middle of the restaurant has a sushi bar and there are plenty of booths and tables to seat other customers.   Started with the Tempura Veggies and Crab Rangoon. Crab Rangoon wasn't my favorite because of the consistency or the crab - I prefer the crabmeat filling more creamy than minced. What I loved most were the unique sushi roll combinations. Del Sol and Surfer Roll were both awesome -- just be aware the Surfer Roll takes quite a while to be prepared. Shrimp Tempura Roll was also delicious. All of the rolls tasted very very fresh - not dry like some other local spots. Can't wait to try some of their other unique rolls. And some more appetizers because they look unique and tasty.   Although I'm not a drinker, my friend LOVES their Fuji apple pear sake because it's so fruity and refreshing. Seemed like they had a pretty comprehensive beverage list.   Can't wait to bring my hubby here as it'd be a nice date night spot - especially if you can get out early enough to hit up the Happy Hour specials!",

We didn't know if our group would be 4 or 6 so the hostess sat us at a four top with an empty two top that could be pulled across.   The sushi was okay. We ordered so much, the sunshine, cowboy/cowgirl, rainbow roll, surf and turf and three other ones I can't remember. Some of the rolls were so spicy I was dying, and all I had to wash it down was the wine I ordered. We asked for more water as only two people were served water at the table and my mouth was on fire to say the least. Some of the sushi tasted a little too fishy and wasn't as cold and fresh and I have had at other places.   Our server was pretty good aside from the water. She offered to split our checks (our two rolls, three alcohol drinks and garlic edamame for about $65) which was nice as many servers don't do that. A drink a girl ordered wasn't available but she brought her something similar without charge. Our group also crossed out some rolls we didn't want since we were so indecisive but ended up getting the rolls anyways. So when the runner was bringing them out were didn't want them since we crossed them off the list but she left them there for us to have anyways without charge. That was nice but probably would've been more cost effective for the restaurant to just read back all the rolls so the food doesn't go to waste.   The bathrooms are clean and I'm a bit of a germ freak and the girls bathroom didn't have any paper towels so I had to touch the door with my wet hands. Maybe they should have someone checking that or add some extra napkins/extra roll.",

We also ordered the Las Vegas (can't remember what is in it but its tempura fried and  incredible). Second visit was on New Years Day. I was a little worried the staff and chefs would be off their game due to the holiday, but nope, still excellent. My only complaint is the seating. Cramped booths or high stools. I have an iffy back and scooting into a booth or having to climb a chair (I'm also just plain short) is difficult. I'd like some standard chairs where I can just sit.",

The prices for happy hour are perfect and it would definitely be fun to come back with a group and hang since the inside is small but chill but the food was just meh and I don't know if it really was the sushi or if I just wasn't feeling it. Born and raised on the east coast living a quarter mile away from the ocean and I'm eating sushi in the desert...  We had the spicy tuna roll which wasn't too spicy and some other roll with crab, crunchies, eel sauce and some other stuff mixed in and that just tasted crunchy and bland. We had the crab rangoon and even that was eh. I don't mean to bash these guys too much since I know they are new and we really did enjoy being there, but as I said...in reality it might just be personal preference and that's ok too. I don't want to be here hurting anyone's feelings since food is just so personal.  Our waitress was nice and cute as was the hostess so that was cool and made us want to come back again with a group to hang out. They also have reverse happy hour so it just sounds/feels like a good place to go towards the end of the night when you want a bite and a night cap.  I want to give these guys another try and hopefully I can order something that's better but I know we will go again since its just a fun spot near our house.",

The staff was friendly, but didn't seem to know what was going on. Nearly every question resulted in a run to the kitchen to ask, and then we had to flag them down again to get the answer.  Lots of options, especially if you're a fan of sushi rolls. They seem to really like tempura, as we went six rolls in a row asking \"What's that one?\" and finding out it had fried shrimp in it. Does anything scream tasty raw fish like rampant deep frying?  Food came fairly quickly, and tasted okay, but then we had two more bouts of misheard requests from our server and it had passed from silly to annoying by that point. We had one regular roll, one mid-range roll from their list, and one of their top end rolls. I'm trying to recall the exact names, but I can't, which I guess tells you how memorable they were.  And I have no idea why the place still looks like a Pizza Hut. Just not the kind of place I want to relax in and enjoy some sushi.  Not horrible, just not that special. I'd almost prefer a chain like Ra over them. If you really want great sushi, look elsewhere.",

    "text": "My Family and I have been dinning here at least twice a month since they opened and usually have great experiences.  Sadly, last night was a different story all together ;-( .  We arrived at 7:30 pm, and even thought they were pretty busy, we were seated right away.  We always start our meal with a couple orders of calamari and were very disappointed to find that the quality had changed.  The calamari they served us last night were tough and rubbery and it was obvious that their management team had selected a new vendor, and compromised quality to improve their margins.  Another dish that brings us in to Sushi Brokers on a regular basis is their Citrus Yellow Tail.  We always order it with thinly sliced jalapenos to spice it up a little bit and last nights chef served it to us with jalapenos cut so thick they would of over powered a plate of nachos. The final fail in this less than impressive dinning experience was the service.  Our waitress forgot one of our selections (woked veggies and brown rice) and when we asked her where it was, she blamed it on the kitchen and told us she would get it started right away.  After 20 minutes and another round of drinks it still hadn't come so we asked her to go ahead and make it to-go and bring us the bill.  Even though the veggies and rice were never brought to the table they were on the bill.   So we decided to stay and wait for them, which took another painful 10 minutes.  I sincerely hope your management team takes some of these criticisms to heart.",

    "text": "Happy hour: started with the Volcano Chicken appetizer. Basically, small bits of chicken in a buffalo wing sauce and a scoop of rice and a useless garnish. Not impressive at all. Glass of Pinot Noir for only $4, great deal. Next, Sashimi: we tried 4 different types of fish, 3 of the 4 tasted the same, as if the fish was either previously frozen or very low grade. Also, their \"sushi chefs\" need some more training in knife skills as the yellowtail had a couple of \"bits.\" And the fish portions were all inconsistent with slices of all different widths and lengths and were not very cold. For the same price of a plate of sashimi, I'll stick with my benchmark: Hiro in Scottsdale with Japanese chefs and the highest quality fish. Service was very good, except for our place setting missing soy sauce dishes that we had to nick from another table.",

The happy hour selection was great, however, most of the options had something spicy involved- spicy tuna, spicy sauce, etc. I loved that, but my mom can't tolerate most spicy foods so we were a bit limited on our selections.  The rest of the menu was great, plenty of options for the non-sushi goer. My dad actually got the sushi burger which has no fish in it at all. They also offered some standard dishes like beef and broccoli and teriyaki chicken.  The happy hour prices were good for sushi and the entrees were reasonably priced. Did not take advantage of any drinks on this visit, but hope to do so in the future.",

The calamari was also good - not too greasy, I liked the cabbage on the side to help cleanse the palate.  So with the exception of the Alaskan roll we thought the food was pretty straight.  All in all, the rolls are delicious, but the prices even at happy hour are kinda higher than I would pay regularly.  So maybe a reserve for a special occasion kinda place?",

We order the chef's special sushimi and sushi plate.  The fish tasted really fresh and there was a nice assortment of fish.  We also ordered several rolls most of which we had eaten or tried before.  We didn't get a bad piece of fish on any thing we ate.  The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 was because I think there was only 1 waitress in the restaurant working all the tables and she was busy!

Our waitress remy arrived soon after and introduced herself kindly and offered to get us started with a beverage.   Remy recommend her favorites through out our meal such as Spring Rolls and the Surfer Roll. Trusting her recommendations we started our meal with these.   The Sufer Roll was absolutely fantastic and super fresh. I also got tuna sashimi on the side, quality of the fish was like nothing I've had before. We decided Sushi Brokers had our business anytime when we want to get sushi. Great service and great food, Will most definitely be coming back and will be asking for remy!",

    "text": "This is only the third time that I have ever taken the time to do a write-up on a restaurant and the other two times were to rip the restaurant apart.  That means this is the first time I EVER did a write-up for positive reasons but I must share my experience.  About four weeks ago on a Friday evening my family and I went in to Sushi Brokers for some take out.  They were exceptionally busy at the time but we wanted sushi so we were patient. We go there often enough that the chefs there basically know us and what we like. We placed our order then sat and had a drink while we waited. When the order was bagged up and being processed for payment, I noticed that something was wrong - the amount we were charged and the amount of sushi we were taking home was way more than normal. Like I said, it was very busy and we have been going there for so long that we assumed the best, left, and just figured we would get a better understanding as to why when we got home.  Well, when we got home our concerns were realized - what we were served was way more than we ordered - no real fault mind you, just a miscommunication/misinterpretation but a mistake nonetheless.  Because we like Sushi Brokers so much, at first we decided to not say anything.  But then as time went on it was getting to me.  So, two weeks after the incident, I reached out to them and spoke with their Sr./General Mgr, Evan.  We spoke for no more than 3-5 minutes and once Evan fully understood what had happened he told me that the next time I come to the restaurant he would \"take care of me/us\".  Famous last words right?  So a week ago Sunday we took a Sushi snob friend of ours from California to Sushi Brokers before sending him home.  Sushi Brokers made their famous hand rolls (best I have ever had bar none), their famous sashimi pizza (yes I said that correctly and damn well worth trying at least once), and their famous pickled wasabi tobiko.  My friend was blown away and in fact he and his family are coming back to the valley over Xmas break and that is the first place he wants to take his them.  But here is the kicker.  EVERYONE IN THE PLACE KNEW WHO WE WERE.  Evan not only \"took care of us\", but he made ABSOLUTELY SURE that everyone took care of us.  Then after a wonderful enough experience that our sushi snob friend wants to make going to Sushi Brokers a staple every time he comes to town, but when the check came it was discounted enough to completely make up for the over spend the time before.  So, in conclusion, while you may find \"better sushi\" elsewhere if you try hard enough, you will NEVER find a better combination of quality, originality, ambiance, and most important REAL ass-kissing customer service.  Sushi Brokers always had us at \"hello\" each time we went, but now they have us returning every time after each \"good-bye\".",

I wish my son was better behaved and I feel bad for anyone who's lunch was disturbed by his crying but this incident was very embarrassing for me and my wife and I feel it was a bit extreme and uncalled for by the owner. The management of this restaurant or in this case the owner failed to be understanding of my son's disability and treated us poorly.  I gave sushi broker one star because I am not the first yelper who has been asked to leave sushi broker and based on my personal experience and other reviews, this guy has unresolved issues and enjoys taking them out on his customers.  We must stand up for people with disabilities and so I can no longer visit this establishment based on principal, which is a shame because we always had excellent food and good service untill now.  If you choose to frequent this resteraunt I recommend you be on your best behavior, don't bring your kids or anyone with a disability or you may be unjustly asked to leave like me and others before me.",

We ordered two pieces of the salmon sushi, a spicy tuna roll, caterpillar roll, vegas roll, and two other rolls that  I can't remember. Wow, now that I type that, we ate a ridiculous amount of food. Anyways, I really liked the salmon and spicy tuna roll, but everything else was just okay. I definitely wouldn't have wanted to pay full price for anything. Unfortunately, the caterpillar roll was not on happy hour and it was definitely not worth $15.  When the bill came, I was kind of surprised it was $85. Granted we ordered a lot of food, but it was still happy hour. I noticed my wine wasn't discounted and the bartender said that wine wasn't on happy hour, even though the happy hour menu says \"all wines by the glass...$2 off.\" Some of the rolls that we ordered that were on happy hour also did not seem to be discounted.  For the price, I don't really think I will be making Sushi Brokers a regular happy hour spot. I think Stingray's sushi is just as good, and the happy hour is much more affordable.",

Never had it before and it isn't something I tend  to order. I wanted something meaty. It was the worst bowl of shite I've had served to me. I swear  you can get better at Panda. I paid extra for meat. There was about 7 pieces of starburst sized bites. I don't want this place to close. So please tweak the menu!!! I beg you! There are no decent Asian places in this neighborhood. Maybe add pho? But use an experienced chef who specializes in pho. Its all in the broth. Add some poke. And use odesza radio on Spotify. Start there. Thanks! Love you guys! Chk out sushi deli in hillcrest/mission hills. Recon mission. Lol.",

Service was a little weird, they had one guy that seated us from behind the bar, who then took our order for sushi, but we also wanted hot food, so we had to call him over again. He seemed a little slammed as he was doing this for everyone else too, usually servers come behind the bar to take your drink/hot food order. I've eaten at sushi bars many times, but the process here seemed a little confusing.   We order the calamari, it was cooked pretty well and came with a spicy buffalo type sauce - not bad. We also ordered salmon skin, yellow tail nigiri, and the pineapple roll. The nigiri didn't seem as fresh as I would've liked it, however the pineapple roll was pretty awesome, a great mix of flavor with fresh fruit. Price was $48 before the Deal Chicken.   I know I can go to Hana and get the same thing for $30 and it tastes much fresher, and the service is better. So I would probably only return with a Deal Chicken.",

    "text": "Went there last night with my guy pal, armed with a Deal Chicken.  The place was packed and lots of fun energy abounds.  I ordered the salmon roe sushi and salmon roll.  He ordered teriyaki salmon with veggies and white rice.  The teriyaki sauce is good.  I'm glad to report it doesn't taste like that whatever that awful stuff is that comes out of a bottle like another Japanese restaurant I've been to, which happens to be trendy and expensive.    He isn't JA and likes his fish cooked.   Alas, it was cooked on the outside, but not on the inside.  YIKES!   We called over the server, Rachael, and she was most apologetic and asked if he wanted to have the same fish cooked more or a complete new meal.  My guy said, \"Whatever is easier.\"  (He surely didn't want to upset the chef!)  Well, they brought out a complete new dinner.  Nice!  Unfortunately, this time it was a little bit too cooked, which could be that the chef wanted to make sure it was cooked, which my guy appreciated.    Back to my sushi, the salmon roe smelled and tasted a bit too fishy.  Those who know what salmon roe tastes like know what I mean.  Yes, it is fish eggs and it is supposed to be fishy, but it's like fish that is heading towards the end of its edible life.  The salmon roll was good.  I'm not real big on those type of rolls.  Me, I like the seafood plain and plopped on a bite-size bit of rice and wrapped in nori.  That's my way of eating sushi.     To make up for the teriyaki and its uncooked condition, the restaurant was kind enough to give us pears with ice cream and whipped cream, topped with a flavorful sauce.  YUMMMM!!   That was fabulously wonderful.  I'm glad I didn't order a lot to eat!   Getting back to our server, Rachel -- Notice I spelled it two different ways since I don't know how she spells her name? -- she was very professional and friendly   When I go back, I hope she is our server again.  She's extremely gracious.  I would go back.  The next time I go, though, I would try the tuna sushi -- no not the rolls; remember, that's not my favorite way of eating sushi -- try the salmon roe sushi again, and whatever else strikes my fancy.",
