    "text": "We REALLY wanted to like this place because it's right down the street from us. It's a cute place, but the menu is very limited and the items we ordered were just ok. We tried the Philly Goat and Tuscan bruschetta. My husband enjoyed the Philly Goat, I felt like it should have been served hot (though I realize traditional bruschetta has a cold topping). The Tuscan was just ok.   Each of us ordered a salad as our entree. He the Strawberry Fields and I the Tino's. Both were underwhelming. We each opted for the \"perfect green blend\" which was mostly spinach. The salads were average at best; I've thrown together far better myself and the dressing on the Tino had an odd flavor that I couldn't place, maybe from the cider.  I would suggest that the \"Choose the Perfect Pear\" menu item allow for a 1/2 sandwich option, not just 1/2 pasta.  Because we want to support neighborhood establishments, we will try it again. I'll try the Grilled Cheese next time. Hopefully it will improve with time.",

The chardonnay tasted like it was purchased t from CVS. Yet, we we charges as though it was a $50.00 bottle of wine..Absolutely, terrible. In fact,  it was recommend by the waitress.In addition every table had a candle and was lite, However, ours was not.. Ummmm Maybe, because we were African American.. Not to mention,the pasta dish with chicken was overcooked and bland...Then to top it off,!!!  Our car was KEYED BY SOME Redneck raciest  bastard!!!! Who does that in this day and age??!! Really, just some jealous idiot!! go get a job and by your own BMW... As for the dinner and drinks it sucked! We should have went  to the Livingroom in Chandler where there are classy people... Instead it costed us $550.00 for dinner!!",

Our experience was much like Yelp, a few good things with some not so great things.  Rating experience on Feb. 14th.  We made a reservation for valentines evening to sit outside, they only had early times available.  We were excited to sit outside with the beautiful weather but, when we arrived there were no tables available.  We started with a happy hour drink inside, the prices were reasonable.  We finally got a table outside and started with a Brie appetizer, it tasted good but, the portion was tiny, I let my husband have it.  I don't eat a lot of pasta and I was excited to ordered the Roasted Garlic Alfredo linguini.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed in how bland it tasted, I tasted no flavor nor garlic.  My husband knew I was disappointed and asked them if I could change and get the same thing he had, they were very accommodating.  My husband had ordered the Amatricana cavatappi, a pasta with bacon sauteed with red onion, tomato, basil and Romano cheese.  We both liked the dish but, unfortunately we both had bad stomach aches and were sick later that evening.  We had a nice waitress and they did try.",

The pear cobb was excellent all the flavors matched perfect.  Pesto chicken was amazing the texture and flavor was a great match.  Last the sweet potato fries...

She had attitude when asked about the happy hour menu and just basically delivered THE worst customer service I've ever experienced within a time span of 2 minutes. I did mention to her that her attitude was ridiculous and was starred down by a cook. Needless to say my friend and I walked out and did not dine there. it's sad because the menu looked great, and my friend and I were looking forward to our first dining experience there. It was completely ruined and we are on our way to eat somewhere else. I'm sure the restaurant itself is awesome but it seems to me that the staff need some training on customer service.

They were both fine, but I believe the weak link is the bread. Both items came on the same light, airy bread that may be better suited for other dishes. But I would have preferred something with more texture.   The Sicilian sandwich was flavorful, but was served on a focaccia bread that was wetter on the bottom than I would have liked. Again, they need better bread. My fries were battered shoestring, not homemade and were good.   Wife's jalapeno grilled cheese was tasty and appeared to be grilled on wheat. it was served with sweet potato fries, I believe from a bag. Which is fine, but she would have preferred something other than ketchup for dipping.   The service was prompt and friendly and the atmosphere was great. I like the look of the restaurant and it was comfortable and inviting.   Obviously, I'm a bread guy. Explore other options for breads, as their are many. And your menu will improve greatly. Regardless , I think I will be back.",

I went for lunch on a Sunday, and I'll be going back for happy hour as well as more lunches.    The patio was a perfect place to sit on a sunny afternoon, with plenty of shade available.  Service was excellent - attentive without being annoying.    I had the olives & pesto goat cheese appetizer.  I've never seen an app quite like this, and really enjoyed it.  The crostini were crisp but not too crisp, the pesto and goat cheese were fresh, and it has a very generous helping of assorted olives.  I also ordered the Wild Chop Salad on the spinach and kale mix.  It also included dried cranberries, feta cheese, cucumbers, roasted red peppers, pears & sunflower seeds.  The roasted red pepper slices were much bigger than any other component in the salad and didn't really fit in with the rest of the dish.  I put them aside and ate them separately - the rest of it was tasty.",

I will definitely be a regular here.   There were 5 of us that stopped in for lunch but told them that we were really short on time.  Top quality service. Great servers who know what they are doing.  The food was outstanding and I'm a picky foodie.  Loved the French onion soup with 1/2 strawberry salad.  The iced tea was so refreshing! They even willingly split our checks 5 ways and they even performed well on time.  We left just 25 minutes later, full and satisfied.  We hope this new restaurant does well.

    "text": "Last Friday night I met up with a friend who lives in the Ahwahtukee Foothills for a drink and light dinner. I was really excited to finally try Perfect Pear Bistro. This location isn't as busy as the Tempe location and that's nice on a Friday. It's also in a super lovely area. There is patio seating but it's still a little humid and hot so we opted to seat inside. We had just missed the happy hour specials which feature a tapas menu that looked interesting. I truly wished that those tapa offerings were available even when happy hour is over. As there are some great sounding tapas on that hh menu! I should have just hurried up and got here earlier ! The menu is a diverse selection of appetizers; pita flatbreads; salads; very interesting grilled cheeses such as a Jalapeno Bacon! Yum!! There are also good looking pastas and soup of the day using fresh ingredients. Today it was a Wedding Soup. You can definitely be healthy here and that's a nice change. Firstly, we opted to split a bottle of white wine. We took the recommendation of the waiter and got a nice Reisling. I would love to see a sparkling wine or champagne offered here. The waiter brought us our wine and just plopped it down on our table : no ice bucket!? We finally got that a few minutes later while ordering our entrees and having to ask. Cmon now. Our entrees were very good: mine was the Philly Goat Flat Bread. It was a flat bread of pita, carmelized sweet onion, goat cheese and mushrooms. It comes with Marsala sauce but I am not a fan and just asked that my flatbread be drizzled with a little olive oil prior to baking and that was no problem. It was super yummy and enough for a light dinner. My friend had the Creamy Butternut Rigatoni made with fat tubes of rigatoni , butternut squash, topped with bacon and walnuts and a signature butternut squash creamy sauce which was seemingly a little odd sounding but was creamy, and a tad but cinnamon and very, very yummy! We both ordered side salads to have prior to the meal. Hers came prior, mine came only seconds before my meal. Super pet peeve of mine. Great salads tho! The decor is industrial and nice. There is a small bar too and a great cocktail menu. Perfect Pear is a great place for this area as there is not really anything like it up in the Foothills. Everything was very good ... but the service from our waiter was well, anything but perfect. He just seemed annoyed with us and our requests half the time! Since I am a champagne / sparkling wine girl, it would also be perfect to add that to the menu. We did really like Perfect Pear and its definitely worth another shot :)",

For me: a Tino's Salad with their lick-the-bowl cider dressing. This comes with beets, goat cheese and bacon. All of which are delicious, but the tiny shred of beets would be so much better left BiGGER and the bacon was too hard to enjoy. Still, I'd order it again.   My friend: Chop Salad with their Greens Blend lettuce. Love the fact you can choose from Spring Mix or their Kale, arugula Greens Blend!   We shared: Olives with Goat Cheese & Pesto which was very tasty on crostini. Lots of olives come in a bowl topped with a delicious blend of tasty spread.",

Place was half empty and when we were seated, we indicated that we had to be out by 6pm so that we could get to an event. Setting expectations with the server ... Right? Started off with the server getting the drinks all wrong ... Not good. We ordered two sandwiches, knowing they could be made in short order, light fare and we could be on our way. Three refills later on my beverage which we had to struggle to get, and our sandwiches arrived. It was now 550pm. We immediately asked for the check. It was hard to find the piece of chicken on the ridiculously large ciabatta bread. Wow ... You can get a $9 sandwich here, just do not expect much on it.  We actually had to wave our hands in the air to get the attention of the server to take our credit card so we could get out. Which happened at 615pm. We would have been better off ordering from Dominos or Macdonalds which are right next door.  Up your game in a big way if you want me back. WAY too many other good places around to have to settle for an experience like that.",

The manager did not apologize or even offer to take care of our tea for the inconvenience. She was annoyed and brushed us of.

We came in on a Thursday afternoon around 12 pm and were surprised to see that the restaurant was pretty busy.  We were greeted right away by the owner and seated. Our server was very quick and took our orders and was very friendly.   The food was delicious and portioned well. My mother had the Quad City Melt and Greek side salad.  She liked the sandwich and was too full to eat her side. I had the Spring Linguini with chicken and it was good. The sauce was flavorful and i liked the amount of veggies that was included in the dish. I had too much that I has to take the rest home.  I saw other dishes served to other guests and the salads were huge and had a lot of yummy toppings.   The owner came by to check on how we were doing and we were pleased with how genuine she was with her service.  You could tell in how she interacted with each guest that she cared about how their experience was.  I noticed also that they have a decent tapas menu and a vast array of drinks, especially mules, for happy hour.  I plan on taking my husband there soon to try them out.",

    "text": "I'm happy to see that a business seems to finally be making it in this location after so many have failed. Ahwatukee, the Foothills in particular, is in dire need of more dining options that aren't pizza or a chain.  As a rule, I avoid new restaurants until they've had a couple of months to iron out the kinks, but I'd been hearing good things about Perfect Pear for a while, so last night, my daughter and I went for dinner. I really wish that I could say that I'm excited to return, but in truth, I probably won't dine there again.  We encountered the first glitch of the evening as soon as we entered. No one was at the front to greet us, nor was there a sign indicating that we should seat ourselves. So for five minutes, we stood there by the entrance feeling a bit foolish. I passed the time by looking at the laminated menu (which gave me pause--I understand the practical aspects of lamination, but, gosh, they really evoke places like Dennys, not a restaurant that clearly is trying to be much more than that). While we waited for someone to direct us, I made eye contact with someone working in the partially open kitchen, but he just ignored us. I told the young lady who eventually seated us that it was our first visit, and that I had no idea whether or not we were supposed to seat ourselves.  I don't think she took my point.  To my relief, our server arrived almost immediately to take our drink orders. Yay!  The menu is limited to starters, salads, pasta and sandwiches, which seems perfectly in line for a bistro, and each category has good variety of offerings. On our server's recommendation, I ordered the Tukee Pear quesadilla to begin the meal.  It came out to the table fairly quickly and was really big. And delicious looking--the tortilla was perfectly crisped and puffed up and contained just the right amount of its filling of pear, bacon, arugula and pepper jack. It was so good, I even convinced my ultra-picky child to try it. The spicy dipping sauce (sour cream-based, I believe) complemented it nicely.  So our meal was off to a really good start.  For my dinner, again on the server's recommendation, I ordered the Wild Chop salad made with their baby green blend (kale, spinach, arugula) with salmon added. I should add here that I LOVE salad. In fact, it's kind of my litmus test for restaurants. I don't care how good the rest of the meal is, if the salad--even just a house side--is some depressing affair thrown together like an afterthought, then whoever is running the kitchen isn't paying attention to the details. That never bodes well.  When the salad *is* the meal, you should expect that just as much care goes into it as any other dish.  This salad landed with an absolute thud. Sadly, the two smallish pieces of salmon were so overcooked, desiccated and hard. This poor fish had been done a grave injustice. Still, I decided to give the rest of the salad a try before throwing in the towel.  I suspect that whoever made my salad doesn't much care for them. What a mess. The greens on top were dry, making me wonder if someone forgot to dress them. There also appeared to be no thought put into the composition of the dish--the greens were randomly topped with a tablespoon or two of plain quinoa, a few long pieces of soggy cucumber and roasted bell pepper, a sad lump of crumbled feta... I took a bite of the greens and couldn't taste any pesto dressing. When I dug down, though, I realized that it hadn't been left off after all--it was all just at the bottom, alas. So some of the salad was under-dressed and rest was drenched. At that point, I just put my fork down and said, \"This is pitiful.\"  Meanwhile, my daughter was pigging out on the huge side of seriously good crinkle-cut sweet potato fries that came with her (not) Perfectly Grilled Cheese, which, like my salmon, was terribly overcooked. We could both see that one side of it was pretty charred, but, hey, charred bread can still be tasty. Just not this time. I don't know if the spiced pear bread was a little stale to begin with or if it just suffered during cooking, but the sandwich was really tough and dry. None of the ooey gooey lusciousness I'd expected. My daughter had gamely eaten one half, but abandoned it for the fries. It wasn't until I tried a bite that I realized how bad the sandwich actually was. I let her open up the remaining half and eat the cheese and bacon. I ate some of the bread, anyway, because I was hungry.  To the restaurant's credit, our server handled the salad problem gracefully, apologizing and removing it from the bill. I had a bowl of okay tomato soup instead. I didn't bother complaining about the sandwich, since most of it was eaten.   I'd hoped that the Perfect Pear would become my go-to neighborhood place for dinner. But I just don't have faith that the kitchen is paying attention to everything that comes out of it. That's a shame.",

The Perfect Grilled Cheese had four cheeses, including Brie, along with arugula and bacon.  The melty goodness combo was wonderful, and I would definitely order this sandwich again. Sandwiches were on tasty breads. I highly recommend ordering the sweet potato fries, too. They might be the best I've ever had.  Awesome second visit.  The service was excellent, once again.

Lately, we have noticed they have given less and less food for the price.  My husband ordered a chicken club and barely got any chicken on his sandwich and only a few sweet potato fries.  I ordered butternut squash soup and it looked like yellow water.  For $10 entrees, I expect a little more quantity and quality.  Will not be returning..",

And just a small amount of green chile flavored the whole dish.  The tukee pear was an exquisite quesadilla with a sweet bite of pear now and again - outstanding.  The philly was a little underwhelming, but still fine.  The server was pleasant and attentive. The atmosphere was quiet (an hour before closing) and relaxing.  This place is a keeper for us!",

I enjoyed the olives with goat cheese and crustini.  Great serving size and flavor for only $4.  Also had the 1/2 salad with 1/2 pasta.  Got the strawberry salad and forgot to ask for no bacon so I couldn't eat it.  The waitress did not offer to remake it so I just brought it home for hubby.  Tried the mushroom marsala pasta and it was the best part of the night..  Seriously YUM!  The worst part was that there is only one bathroom so we often had to wait for someone to come out of the ladies room to be able to go in.",

They use rosemary for that one and it is amazing. If you ever save room, the pear peach cobbler is a must. Last night we dined in and tried something totally new - falafel! I've never had falafel before but on this sandwich it was drizzled with buffalo sauce. Yum!   This location has amazing patio views of the mountains and the little park next to it.

The sprouts bowl was mostly greens.  We had added chicken and falafel. It was over fried.  The menu reads delicious but did not live up to the sound of it.  We were there for a meeting. We informed them early on.  The restroom was dirty. Paper everywhere. Dusty shelves. Obvious not monitored.  The very young staff was very very casually dressed. Yoga pants on one, torn denim short short shorts on another. Greasy messy hair... What a shame.  We conducted our business until they turned on the lights and stood at the door with back packs at 8:55. Time to go I guess.  Our tab with tip was $100. Not so good for food we didn't eat and$10 glasses of wine.   Sad because the place has so much potential.  We won't be back to the Ahwatukee not so perfect pear.",

Service is always good, and the ambience is cozy yet upscale.",

They use bread from a local bakery which made all the difference and the salad greens were fresh, tender greens (no crappy iceberg lettuce here). The service was awesome as well, attentive but not over the top or phony. The food came out extremely fast but did not sacrifice quality. We decided we will definitely be back, maybe for a dinner. They looked to have a great wine menu so it's worth coming back for!",

We had everything from apps, to salads, to sandwiches, to entrees.  Everything tasted very fresh and the quality of ingredients utilized were impressive.  We did suggest a balsamic glaze for the original bruschetta, but otherwise, the cuisine was spot on.  We always order our salad dressings on the side, so there's never room for overdressing.  The food presentation was very nice.  We were happy with the wines-by-the-glass and the beer selections.  There was a robust crowd and it was clear everyone was enjoying their experience.  The music selection was also fine for us.  They have to try to please everyone, and that is a difficult task when you have a wide age range of patrons.  We liked the ambiance, and the wait staff and owners were very attentive to our needs.  The prices were reasonable, and we will definitely be returning again.  For it being their first week in business, we were quite impressed with the restaurant overall.",

Ingredients were a decent combo, but the foccacia bread ruined it. The other item we got was the mushroom marsala pasta. Not even close to what it should have been. It was just a plate of undercooked penne noodles, a tiny bit of bland sauce, and a few mushrooms. It was actually gross.  This restaurant even had yelp remove my review, so I am adding it back now. Apparently, descriptions of restaurant guests are against \"content guidelines\", lol! So I have to remove that section. (so this can stay a Safe Space)   Overall I do not recommend this place. Instead, Pomegranate Cafe is down the street and is priced similarly, sells organic food, is vegan, and it actually tastes good. Go there.",

Instead of a trendy bistro with elevated dining, it was rude servers, food that may have sat in the window too long and a bartender who couldn't make our drink.... although she did bring us all the ingredients in three different glasses and left them on the table for us to make it ourselves....so there's that.  In my opinion this place is overrated.",

Friends that attended are still telling me how much they liked the food and how attentive and sweet the staff was throughout the party.  I preordered food and they made a buffet. Laura made everything so easy for me.  Despite traveling, I was able to plan it all with Laura via email and she was very accommodating.  We had a few leftovers and heated them up later that evening with some friends.  There wasn't a morsel left!   Many thanks to The Perfect Pear for making my Husbands BDay a truly special event!",

I know they're closing this location in May but they should probably focus on going out with a bang instead of mediocrely fading away. When we walked in, we asked for a seat outside and the host, this 16 year old, told me without looking there were no seats and had quite the attitude. On top of that.. the Perfect Pear Grilled Cheese barely had any CHEESE and had really hard bacon in it. Also.. the sweet potato fries weren't even cooked all the way. The waitress' were all very sweet as well as one of the bus boys. But idk.. the food makes it for me, not just the service. The Tempe location is one hell of a lot better! The General Manager at the one by ASU is literally the best!! Stick to experienced cooks and staff folks",

Most of the dishes are vegetarian to start and then you can add a protein for an additional fee. I also love that they do half orders so you can try multiple dishes. I order a half salad (strawberry fields) and a half pasta (lemon linguini, with chicken added). Both portions were very large! I loved the salad, but I thought the pasta lacked flavor. I think I just picked a bland dish though. When I tired the rest of the table's food, it was delicious! Omg the sweet potato fries are huge! And the green garden quinoa dish was incredibly flavorful.

    "text": "So, disappointing, I can't tell you. I live in walking distance and wanted for months to stop in. I finally walked in yesterday (Sunday) at around 4:00pm. Sat outside on the patio overlooking the parking lot and road. Ever since My Big Fat Greek Restaurant closed near by, I've been desperate for a consistent \"go to\" for noshing and drinks. Perfect Pear is a faux bistro with no bar, no charm and zero ambience. The restaurant smelled like smelly cheese - maybe cheap grated romano - so the patio was the escape. The menu offers typical easy-to-make, low risk, but high profit dishes. The drink menu is pedestrian and boring. No buttery chards and warm room temp reds. The waitress thought Pinot Gris was a misprint and apologized !?! So, the foodie in me already knows the pasta selections are embarrassingly ill conceived, so think American corporate like Chili's or Carraba's. So, what to do? Well, order something that few restaurants can screw up --- bruschetta!!  Trendy, high profit, easy with fresh ingredients. The Classic came on soggy focaccia, hardly toasted, with tasteless, off-red tomatoes with red onion and julienne'd basil (not torn). Then, (get this) topped with cheap-of-the-cheap romano cheese (see above). Any shot at being edible was ruined by the grated romano. The Chef must have zero culinary instincts or just doesn't care because there is no real competition in the area. Unforgiveable. The Lolita was actually worse. Please don't say \"avocado\" when you really mean a brown guac spread. We ordered the olives and pesto goat cheese. Why ruin pesto with goat cheese? The crostini with the olives was the best part of the meal. My partner reconstructed the bruschetta using the crostini and the edible parts of what was served. I marvel at new owners who seemingly don't avail themselves of the basic \"how to's\" and \"do's and dont's\" of culinary.   Please -- owner and chef -- do a dine around in Phoenix, take the entire week and then re-vamp your concept and menu. I'll be back in (3) months because I refuse to go to Native New Yorker. I'm serious.   Much luck.   D",

Here's the deal: for the price, the best pasta and salad place in town. Yes, there are more upscale restaurants, but for $11 total, I had a bowl of the following amazing salad--spinach, baby kale, arugula, with hazelnuts, diced pears, blue cheese, dried cranberries, and red onion, all lightly dressed and nicely balanced...AND a bowl of creamy mushroom Marsala pasta, which was rich but not overly heavy. The house wine was ok, about what you'd expect for five bucks. The service was cheerful and attentive. Overall, a nice local place, not pretentious, and very good at what they do. And yes, plenty of good vegetarian options. Hurrah!",

    "text": "We tried this restaurant because we are new to the neighborhood and love trying new places.  A few observations, wine prices were terribly exorbitant.  At $10 for a glass of no-name Riesling, I just can't seeing myself doing that again.  My family ordered 2 kids meals with grilled cheese, I had the Perfectly grilled cheese (reminded me of a Monte Cristo sans the meat) and my husband had a plate of Alfredo, for what we ordered  $65 including tip just seemed over the top.  I think this place wants to have a high end feel, but the lack of a formal bar (bottles were huddled together on the serving line) and the male owner walking around in FLIP FLOPS, detracts from the high-end feel (think Postino's) that this restaurant wants to achieve.  A few suggestions for the owners (who I recognized from their picture in the paper): DRESS PROFESSIONALLY, and introduce yourselves as the owners so you can get constructive feedback from your patrons.  You'd think that the owners are embarrassed for anyone to know the place is theirs.  Next, move the alcohol behind the counter so you can at least PRETEND you have an actual bar, and please offer wine specials, most people (like me) like to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner and if that part of my dining experience is cost prohibitive, then I won't go to that restaurant for the food.  Next, turn the music down.  Dining is a social experience and if I can't hear people at my table, I'd rather just go somewhere else.  Finally, improve the customer service, your waitresses (and the female owner) dropped things on the table then ran off before we could ask for things like napkins, condiments, etc.  I thought this type of service was very unprofessional and makes me hesitant to return.  Overall, this place has excellent food.  I hope they can make some minor tweaks to their establishment so that they can hang around for the long haul and be a place people can go to in Ahwahtukee for a great meal!",

The food seems more consistent for eat in than carry out. Ordered take out again and for the 2nd time, my order was messed up by the kitchen and I had no dressing for my salad. With a four month old at home, going back for a corrected order is just too much trouble. If the kitchen could slow down and read the orders, it would make a huge difference as the person taking the order read it back and it was correct. The food is yummy and it is a new place so there are kinks to be worked out. If they could get my order right, I'd bump this review to four stars. In this day and age of customer service being near non-existent, a little attention to detail and service would set this restaurant above the rest in our little neighborhood!

    "text": "We've wanted to try this restaurant for awhile....considering it is relatively close to our home down the street.   First impressions were hit and miss. The restaurant entrance leaves much to be desired. There was no waiting area and a table located adjacent to the double doors. The lighting and decor were perfect in certain areas of the restaurant. Outside seating on the patio was available but we chose a table inside near the restrooms.   The service.... Was above average and did not feel pressured during the ordering process and our server and was knowledgeable about the wine and food menus. What appeared to be the manager/owner was unimpressive with an untucked shirt and upon asking for salt and pepper (not on the table) we were provided with McCormick's store-bought grinders. This felt like eating at home. The silverware was wrapped with paper napkins a la Denny's diner style. They could have provided cloth napkins as a nice touch of class.   The food:  Appetizer....We ordered the bruschetta that we ordered was the \"signature\" and the \"philly goat.\" The bread was not the typical bruschetta crusty hard bread that we are used to. It seemed a little undergrilled. The caramelized onions and mushrooms were well prepared on the \"philly goat\" with slightly too much cheese. The \"signature\" was very fresh and tasty but the bread was a little soggy.  Salad....We ordered the \"Strawberry Fields\" salad which was fresh and light. However, it would have been nice to have a decanter of salad dressing on the side because people have preferences regarding how much salad dressing each individual may want on their salad.   Entree.....The AMATRICIANA, a la macaroni tomato mixture was unimpressive, lacking salt, pepper, or imagination. We did not order it with any chicken or salmon but seriously doubt that it would have improved the flavor of this lackluster dish. Did I mention asking for pepper???  Wine....Arizona Stronghold was the wine of choice and was a welcome sight. The restaurant also has a great selection of craft beers to compliment the menu.   Endnotes...... The music playing was at the appropriate decibel level and genre. Great songs by the Police and others. However, hearing Sheryl Crow blare \"If it makes you happy.........\" was a little too supermarket for us. It would be nice to hear more eclectic in a restaurant such as this one. We hope that this restaurant does not receive this review in poor light as they have a lot going for them and so much potential. Please take the recommendations as pure advice only. We want to come back at some point in time but want improvements or we won't visit a third time.  Ponyrider's",

As with all our meals the ingredients were very scantily spread around the dish.  Particularly noticeably on all our dishes was the lack of sufficient cheese.  The cheese used was very, very minimal, almost to the point of not being there at all.  For the price charged for each of our meals I thought there should a larger portion of ingredients on each of them.  including  my sandwich, a steak and cheese.  Lots of bread and not much meat at all.  I felt the quality of the food presented would warrant about $30-35, but our out the door bill was about $50.  Probably won't go back.

I ordered a stout and it came out.... frozen?!?! I don't know how this would happen, but it was like a slushy, which is not awesome for a beer. I shared the brie and the flatbread with a coworker and also tried the mac and cheese everyone raved about. The brie was just.... brie with some sugar and bacon on top... it was fine, but it didn't blow my mind. The flatbread was decent, but also nothing special. At least the items were on happy hour and only cost 8$ for both. The mac and cheese was terrible, the sauce tasted like it came from frozen or something. It also took forever to get our bills, with each one of us having to ask for our bills individually. I probably wouldn't come back here, but if you're in the foothills, this is a decent place for happy hour.",

    "text": "Well, I was hoping for better.  I was pretty excited about this place opening up in my 'hood, and I met some friends here for happy hour.  The service started out on a bad note.  When we entered, there were four or five employees congregated around the front entrance, and all greeted us with a friendly hello.  However, once we sat down, our table wasn't approached for approx 5 minutes.  But, this place just opened, and I know new restaurants have kinks to work out, so I'll let that slide.  Onto the happy hour menu.  Happy hour only has discounted drinks, which disappointed all of us as we do enjoy discounted apps, etc.  We ordered a few drinks, two appetizers and one salad entree.   For appetizers we ordered the Tuscan plate and the green chili cheese dip.  The Tuscan plate was alright, though we would have preferred a mix of different meats and different cheeses maybe (it comes with a goat cheese, salami, roasted red peppers, olives and crostini) The green chili cheese dip comes with crostini and tortilla chips.  The cheese dip tasted very similar to velveeta cheese dip... which, luckily, I love.  Well, we all love.  But it's not exactly what I expect to be served at a restaurant I guess.    Camille H ordered the Mexican salad, and it was good- but overly dressed.    Now, the atmosphere.  Like many other places in this part of Ahwatukee, this place seems to be geared towards older clientele.  We all ended up commenting on the music situation, as it seemed..... well.... not very hip I guess?   I assume that the kinks with the service and food will be worked out with time.  However, I won't be returning unless the happy hour is revamped and the music selection is changed!",

    "text": "Wow.  It's really been a while since I rushed home to write a review.  I met Sarah H and Dan H here tonight for happy hour.  They just opened on Monday and we were excited something new had opened in the Foothills and we wanted to support them.  Well, first off we met here for happy hour but the only happy hour specials they had was on beer and wine.  Not nearly as happy as we were hoping.  We ordered some drinks, I had a nice Sauvignon Blanc, and looked over the menu.  Nothing on the menu is very inspired or unique but I finally settled on a Mexican salad with black beans and chipotle ranch.  Something cool and crunchy and spicy sounded just right.  Dan ordered a Tuscan meat and cheese platter and Sarah wasn't really hungry so she just got the chili cheese dip which I was looking forward to trying anyway.    We chatted while we were waiting for our food but the place is so loud, it wasn't easy and they had the most god awful music on.  Not quite loud enough you could understand it, but loud enough that it made it difficult to chat.  We thought we heard country music but couldn't be sure.  They definitely need to play something more cafe-ish to set the ambiance of a good meal with friends rather than being at a rodeo.  Sarah's chili cheese dip came out first and we dug in.  It reminded us a lot of that Velveeta dip you make with a can of Rotel, only not as good.  And they didn't give you much either.  We ate it nonetheless because it's cheese, but I don't think we'll be ordering it again.  Dan's meat and cheese plate looked fine but my salad wasn't quite what I expected.  When I ordered it the waitress asked if I wanted Spring Mix for my lettuce or a green lettuce mix.  While I normally go for the darker greens, I thought a green lettuce mix would be best to stand up to a heavy ranch dressing.  What I got was a mix of spinach and arugula, predominately spinach, which couldn't stand up to the creamy dressing and was a soppy mess.  I ate it, but I can't say I would ever order it again.  Any salad here for that matter as the dressing was put on with such a heavy hand, it made what is normally a light meal, heavy and greasy.    We paid and were on our way in under an hour.  It was too noisy and not really conducive to a long leisurely evening of chatting, drinking and eating.  Maybe if they change their menu a bit and I give them some time to work out the kinks, I may try it again, but I'm sure.",

Service was excellent.  Our server was polite, attentive, able to provide insight on several dishes and even had some personal favorites which is always helpful.  She also laughed at our jokes which made her even more charming (haha).  Starter: Thai Hummous plate LOTS of veggies I would get this for HH next time with my chick friends who want to be healthy but also \"happy\".  Salad: Perfect Pear Classic was lightly dressed, very fresh, tasty.  Main Dishes:  I would prefer Shrimp with my Roasted Garlic Alfredo but I settled for chicken and it was moist and tasty and a good sized portion.  The sauce was light and flavorful not greasy or heavy.  Nicely done, would order again as it did not weigh me down!  My companion carnivore was a little disappointed not to see more \"meat\" entrees to sink his teeth into (in his world its not a \"face\" that make it meat - its a Hoof)  the owner allowed us to make a plea and appeared to take it under consideration.  Stay tuned for our next visit!  WOULD RETURN.  WILL RETURN.  Think Local, Eat Local, Spend Local.",

I've tried the Mediterranean Mac & Cheese (roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, arugala, feta and cheesy pesto) as well as as the Creamy Mushroom Marsala pasta (caramelized onions, mushrooms and roasted garlic), but my favorite is the Athena's Garden pasta (zucchini, arugula, caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, and garlic basil sauce) as the garlic flavor is quite strong and delicious. I really like that gluten free pasta is not extra and you can add a protein, salmon, chicken, sausage, etc., on to most things.   Service here has always been great and very attentive.",
