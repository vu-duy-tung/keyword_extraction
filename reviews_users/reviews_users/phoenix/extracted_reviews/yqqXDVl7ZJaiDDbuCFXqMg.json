They usually have live music in the bar on Friday nights. They also have specials during NFL games. I love the smoked turkey platter. If you're unsure of what to try, you can get the sliders and pick three meats and BBQ sauce.",

We were seated right away & started with their onion rings which are only $2. They were AMAZING! The breading was light & crispy without being overly greasy. I ordered the brisket plate with mac & cheese & mashed potatoes with brown gravy.  My mom ordered the chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes & cole slaw. My brisket was very flavorful but pretty dry, the BBQ sauce was definitely needed. Mac & cheese was decent & the mashed was really good, I would just go for cream gravy instead of brown next time. The real superstar was the chicken fried chicken.  This is usually my go-to meal anytime a place has it, I literally search out chicken fried chicken when I go places. This was probably one of the best I have had. The batter was so crispy, just like the onion rings, the chicken was incredibly juicy & their gravy was definitely homemade, no powdered mixes here. Can't wait to come back again very soon!",

    "text": "Just went to Dillon's again yesterday. It's not somewhere you go for ambience . . . Or amazing service, not that our servers have been horrible ever, just busy. Dillon's doesn't even have best menu nor is everything spectacular. Why go then? They're Pulled Pork Sandwich is ridiculous delicious!  I've tried many other things on their menu: the Smoked Salmon, the Southwest Mac n Cheese, the smoked Chicken, the Pulled Chicken Sandwich, the list goes on. None were ever bad. Most seem to lack something whether it was a little more flavor or more moisture in the meat. But their BBQ sauce and their Pulled Pork is off the hook!  If you haven't been there, try that first.  This particular location is a little cooky.They need a remodel. The carpet is something you'd find in a JB's (Are they even around anymore?) or a Coco's. the tables have those wipeable tablecloths which I guess is a little more barbecue-esque. Some tables have these ads all over them which I guess is not really a big deal since it draws your attention away from the mismatched lighting, carpet, and tablecloths. The back windows show a tiny yard for birds which is fenced in so you don't have to look at the parking lot of the body shop next door. They do put the paper towels on the table for cleaning up all the BBQ sauce on your fingers which adds to its authenticity.  Service there is usually so-so. Servers are friendly, hospitable, but often busy. Sometimes it's hard to get a timely refill or an extra side of BBQ sauce. Other than that, adequate.  I'll be back and you know what for.",

We'd previously picked up take-out from this location and although I had called it in and arrived on time to pick it up, they still took about 20 minutes to get our order (it was just pulled pork, what's so difficult?).  We hoped dine-in would be different, and even made reservations. We arrived right on time at 6 pm on a Saturday and were made to wait a while. Then they apparently gave our table to someone else, so quick had to come up with another table. Our server was very nice, but apparently overworked because we rarely saw her. It took a long time to get our drinks, long enough we started wishing we'd ordered our food with our drinks.   The food took a very long time to arrive. It was over an hour from our arrival before we were served even the mac and cheese for my 2 year old, who was getting impatient. Finally got our food and it was just not that good. I've had much better BBQ pulled pork at Thee Pitts Again and never had to wait that long to eat.   All the disorganization and chaos, topped off with so-so BBQ means we won't be back, unless it 's to try the bar without the kiddo. It just takes too much time to get food that ain't that great in the restaurant.",

This was my first time at the Thunderbird location and it went very well. I will be back.    The hostess was very nice and welcoming upon entering and gave me some good suggestions. I ordered the brisket sandwich with Mac n cheese and it was delicious. The brisket was a little dry but the Cajun BBQ sauce was on point. The bartender, Eileen, hooked me up with a free coca cola while I was waiting and while it may not seem like much, that coupled with the atmosphere and warm reception is something that will make people want to go back.  Next time I'll definitely check out the onion rings I have been deprived of for so long   I've had some fantastic BBQ in Kansas City and thjs isn't quite up to the same level when it comes to the food but the smell and atmosphere are right on par",

    "text": "My cross country trip this year has turned me into somewhat of a BBQ snob. So while this rating may seem a little harsh, 3 is still average right?   Anyhow Like a True fattie, I ordered a 3 meat plate baby back ribs, brisket and burnt ends. We got unsold on appetizers and opted for 2 orders of $1 onion rings and some fried shrooms.   Appetizers were decent. For $1 you can't complain about anything. The shrooms were a bit greasy for my taste but I got my daily dose of veggies...   Onto the main dishes: The baby back ribs had a nice bark on them however were a bit on the dry side. Like any rib shack I go to I take a pic of the smoke ring and cross section for reference. Dot believe me take a gander a my pics. I attribute the dryness due to the fact that they were probably smoked early in the afternoon. You could taste the smoke in the meat but because they were dry I needed to sauce them up to help them out. The sweet and hot sauce was ok but not noteworthy enough to buy a bottle and take home.   The burnt ends we're a little on rare side to be called burnt ends. They looked like rib bits versus burnt ends. There wasn't really much or anything burnt about them.   The brisket was the best of the 3 on the platter. It was thin sliced, had a nice smoke ring and was still nice and moist. Not sure what type of sauce was it was served with but it did help keep the brisket from drying out.   All and all, it was ok but it didn't wow me or woo me in any way however, I'd still take Dillon's over Famous Dave's any day.",

( I also used to work at the dillons in sun city grand with Jeff before it closed). We have had him serve us plenty of times and he is one of the best. Anyways, he quickly took the kids food order so that they could eat something since my baby was getting fussy. Our originally server came back to our table a couple of minutes later. She kept apologizing and explained she had a emergency with the babysitter so being a mom of 2 i completely understood.  She was on top of her game the entire time and made up for the delay in getting our food in. My son loved talking to her too. Jeff still came by a couple times to make sure everything was good. Love how attentive everyone was and the food was delicious like always.",

That was the post meal show, along with rabbits and birds hanging out in the skinny backyard. Our seats were not window seats, but those would be the best place to sit to eat and watch the show.     Nothing to complain about at my debut here in this BBQ mecca. The brisket is incredibly lean and presented in a pretty circular fashion on the bun. There is no real smoke ring or bark on the brisket, but it is still great tasting and only needs a smattering of sauce. The other meat we tried was the turkey and those were lean and thicker sliced and also tender and tasty. Most sandwiches were about $10.50, but some other prices are a bit high with combo platters at almost 20 bucks and 1/2 rack at the same price. Ouch. Side dish that stood out was the mac and cheese and both sauces we tried were great with the Cajun nipping out the regular as my favorite.",

I ordered the Brontosaurus beef ribs and was very disappointed that the ribs were dry, tough, over cooked.  I asked for plain butter and the server said that they didn't have any. A restaurant that servers comfort food has no butter?  I ordered a beer with a glass, the beer wasn't very cold and the glass was warm as though it had just been washed (it should have been frosted or chilled).  The food at Dillons isn't the problem, it's the simple details that ruined my visit.",

I ordered the pulled pork with baked potato & baked beans.  Could not eat the beans because of the spicy off taste.  How can you mess up baked beans?  The potato was alright, but the pulled pork was dry and not so tasty.  In my book, the pork and the bbq sauce needed to be together, not separate.  If friends  want to come here, I will, but it won't be my choice.  As for price $20 for a beer and pulled pork is OK, if the quality & quantity are there.  In fairness, others will have a different opinion.",

I'm pretty sure the waitress forgot to put the order in because we didn't get them for 20 minutes. Our dinner order was out quick, but our Mac & Cheese was less than warm. The waitress quickly offered to replace it with fresh hot Mac n Cheese. While that was being done, my wife realized that she received asparagus and not the mixed veggies that the waitress recommended. Oh, and how about some silverware??? My wife then asked where my second side was... At this point, we were ready to go. I declined on my second side. The waitress said \"oh sorry\" when asked about the asparagus. Another waiter then said \"that was yesterday's vegetable of the day\". We passed on one of our family favorites to dine here on Mothers Day and were 100% dissatisfied!!! And to top it off, I was a bit offended that the cashier did a AAA discount of $8.00 to make up for ALL of this. I apologized a million times to my wife and mother of our 5 children for the horrible service she received on her special day!   Kind Regards,   Nick & Megan   FYI I added a pic of checking in from FB but didn't want to share this horrible experience with everyone. My first visit was 100% better than this last.",

There was no flavor, not even with the salsa..... the mac & cheese was the exact same. It looked so yummy from all of the pictures I saw but was very plain. The loaded mashed potatoes were very loaded that I even ate an entire piece of butter because they put so dam much on them and for some reason it didn't melt after I stirred it twice.

Apparently there's no bussers and every server here has a rotten attitude like they hate their job. All in all I feel truly saddened by my visit here, I love the food and bbq. This time though the service was a complete let down, didn't bother talking to management I can only assume this is stemming from the top down. Bad vibes, terrible ambiance.

I was terribly wrong.  I tried so hard to find something good by trying multiple items on the menu.  At their price point, this stuff should knock your socks off, not gag you.  Smoked chicken...not even brined, terrible. Smoked turkey...same thing, blah. Smoked sausage....ballpark hot dog equivalent, seriously disappointing. Smoked brisket.....IT WAS GRAY and DEAD. Baby back ribs...decent but and tender, smoke flavor seemed odd.   Mashed potatoes...cover in gravy, edible.  The national BBQ association should rally and petition to close this place down.  I think they get away with it because most of their patrons are over 70 with a bland flavor palette.  Then again you can try to cover up the disappointment with their sauce.  Service was so so.  Brought out the meal in rounds, so not everyone got food at the same time.  Decor is dated to the 90s.  Feels like you are eating in a retirement home or one of those old Luby's Cafeterias.  Stick to Naked BBQ or equivalent.",

    "text": "Good BBQ meats, but that may be the only saving grace for a return to this location unfortunately.    We arrived around 7 p.m. so a touch after the normal dinner crowd and were seated pretty quickly after we arrived.  Once seated we waited about 20 minutes to get our order taken and  about 25 minutes after that to receive our food.    I had the pulled pork sandwich and he had the pick any 2 meats plate (with sausage and pulled chicken).  For a side my plate had the steak fries and his had the mac and cheese and BBQ beans.  The pulled pork was delish, as was the sausage and the pulled chicken.  The sides were a different matter.  The mac and cheese wan't bad, but it was pretty flavorless.  If you've ever made steak fries in the oven at home, you may be familiar with the struggle to cook them evenly and to have them not turn out soggy in the middle but cooked on the edges.  Dillon's has this same problem.  The middles were definitely soggy and undercooked. while the edges were perfect.  The BBQ beans were the best of the three sides we had.    Server didn't check up on us and never refilled our drinks and forgot to put our Groupon deal on the check when it was brought out.  In his defense he was emptying a few tables when we were wrapping up and coupons are forgotten all the time.  It was just more the accumulation of all the other waiting that compiled this factor onto the negative experience.  Overall: B- / C+ The meats were really tasty.  The sides were lacking, but they have tons to choose from, so perhaps different selections next time?  The wait was pretty hefty, but it's based on a one time  only visit - so grain of salt.  If we have the time and desire for some BBQ we may visit again, but there are lots of other places to try....",

Toasted bun is the only thing that saved the sandwich from falling completely apart. Cole slaw was as others described, just cabbage and mayo like. This was served with a decent portion of steak cut fries, not salted or flavored at all. Potatoes. Deep fried. Bar tender was nice but never asked how my meal was, I would have let her know. Ordered an Arnold Palmer. Seemed like it was pink lemonade, was gross but after eating that choke sandwich I needed a refill.   Overall 2 stars. I don't recommend at all. The only positive is that their portion sizes are reasonable for the price point.",

    "text": "It has been at a few years sense I last ate there.  I loved their catfish and prim rib.  They have focused in on BBQ.  I am not a fan of St. Louis ribs, it would be unfair for me to write a review on them.    Their wait staff was 4.5 star, the onion rigs were crispy and not at all greasy, but they fell short of the best I have had at a Florida neighborhood Fish Camp (not a camp at all, a fish restaurant).   The beef brisket had good flavor and dry.  The sauce, I had on the side was quite good.   In St. Louis style the sauce please a big part, in Texas it is all about the smoke, then the dry rub playing as a supporting roll.  The BBQ sauce is more of an after thought.  Lastly the asparagus was perfect for me.  Sadly by the time I got to them they were cold, my fault. Forget about the apple pie, I hope they didn't make it.the ice cream was just ice cream.     I would have given then  2 stars but the atmosphere and wait strafe I had to give them a higher rating.   I wish I could give them higher for past meals, we are here today, that is what I am reviewing.   I will eat there agai",

My boyfriend keeps buying the Groupons and we keep coming back. I can honestly say if it wasn't for the Groupons we wouldn't come here, but for the price we pay it's a great deal.   This particular visit we started with the breaded mushrooms, they were good, we were able to choose between regular ranch and a chipotle ranch, we went with both.   James ordered the pulled pork with sweet heat like always and I decided to try something new. I ordered the taco salad with chicken and wow was it tasty! That chicken was amazing, it's different than the chicken used in the chicken sandwich. The only thing that could have made it better was guacamole.   We had a table in the back by the window so we got to watch the bunnies. I am, however, deeply concerned about the one that looks like it has a huge tumor on its neck. Has anyone gotten that checked out??",

A truly good BBQ is an art form and Dillion's BBQ is not even close, certainly not \"the best in the valley.\" What you get in portion size (huge) does not make up for the lack of great BBQ flavor and tender meat.  The only reason we went back after our first lackluster meal a couple of years ago, was because of a group event.  It's kind of a dingy place, disjointed in the layout, and not even cute folksy decor - like it was decorated by a committee. Service was lacking - waitress didn't know the menu. I asked if the peaches on the peach salad were fresh and she said yes. She then came back and told me they were canned peaches - really? And this in peach season?? Get a clue, Dillon's! Then on top of it, she got an order wrong - and we kept having to ask for water.  I agree with other Yelper's - there are much better BBQ places around.",

Some of my fries were cold which was odd and left me unsatisfied again.   There was nothing about this visit or this location that could justify a higher rating.

From the outside it does not look to be very large, but when you get inside the place has many rooms to sit. On this occasion we were fortunate to have a window that looked out to the rabbit pen. Made the wait easy. We enjoyed watching the rabbits hopping around.  The restaurant was clean and everyone treated us like they wanted us to enjoy ourself and the meal. I got the rib tips and they were good. My two sides was A salad and a salad. Our food was delivered in a good amount of time. Only down side was I like Balsamic vinegar on my salad and they did not have.",

As a matter of fact, the staff went above and beyond for us when we had trouble accessing their Wi-Fi.  A manager rebooted the system as we were having problems connecting.    I absolutely love their pulled pork sandwiches, so I had one.  It was delicious!  The pulled pork was Bar-B-Qed perfectly and was not fatty or greasy -- this is an issue I have other local Bar-B-Q restaurants.    The dining experience was excellent this visit.  Highly recommend.",

Not only did someone else come refill our drinks, we all got our food except our 4 year old. 10 minutes after she still didn't have food, we asked him to check on it for us and a few minutes later he nonchalantly comes back and says \"we're out of the shark bites\". No sorry, didn't ask if he could get her something else, nothing. So as we're almost all done with our food, our daughter finally gets some chicken fingers. Again no apologies or anything. While the food was decent, probably wouldn't return just because of how slow and bad the service was.",

    "text": "Where to start. With the loud obnoxious drunk at the end of the bar at 330 in the afternoon?  (Who as it turns out, works there. Well. At least that's what he told everyone at the bar and the restaurant.). Seriously. At one point, he was literally barking. Like a dog. And I'm not kidding. The guy stepped out for a smoke and almost nosedived right by my table. And when he left all I could think was \"I hope he's not driving...\"). Or should I start with the food. Ok in a second. First, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention what a dive this place is. And I don't mind dives, but this place was \"restaurant rescue\" needing kind of dive.   Ok. Lifted kilt. Not bad  Food:  I got the combo with \"smoked\" turkey and \"burnt ends\", cole slaw and a baked potato (they don't have chives?). The \"burnt ends\". Ugh. More like flavorless cubed up pot roast. They obviously don't know what burnt ends really are. The \"smoked\" turkey. A little better but not smoked as far as I could tell. (No smoke rings). The \"sweet & hot\" bbq sauce is the only saving grace. The cole slaw. Super bland. Basically, cabbage and maybe mayo?  The baked potato with butter and sour cream. How do you mess that up?  You microwave it, that's how. I got a dinner roll. It didn't taste house made. Maybe store bought.    The service:  when the server paid attention to me, she was super nice. In fact I feel a little bad about writing such a negative review, but this has very little to do with her. Sorry, \"C\".   It looks like this is really just a beer joint that happens to serve food. There were probably 20-25 people in there and I only counted 6 ladies. So...    I tried to connect to the wifi but I couldn't get it to work.   That plate plus the one beer and a nice tip for the server set me back 30 bucks.   Maybe the overall experience would have been better on the restaurant side rather than in the bar area. But I'll end by saying I'm still looking for a good bbq place on the west side.",

Dillion's has the best fried food ever because the batter is so good and the fried mushrooms, zucchini, pickles, and onions are fresh. The sauces they give are really tasty. They give you hot sauce and ranch that we ran out of real quick. Ordering the wings dry and dipping it in the hot sauce is really good and their chili nachos are so good , their gone in a couple seconds. The chili nachos come in a large platter and somehow my whole family gobbles it all down and wants more. To make it even better, they have great, friendly service that just makes you happy to be there. You get nice cold, beers that are perfectly bubbly. (That's what my dad thinks.)",

Towards the end, I prefer to order in pints and make it to-go, I think you get more meat per dollar that way.  Otherwise, service is great and I wouldn't mind eating at the restaurant.  I live around the area so if I am craving for some decent BBQ but not willing to drive more than 10 minutes, then here is what I would get from Dillon's:  Pork rib - This is probably one of their best BBQ meat, in my opinion of course.  Sausage - It's okay...it's really just okay.  Even Angry Crab has better sausage than this place but I wouldn't mind order it if I am already at Dillon's.  VEGGIE OF THE DAY - Let me put it this way, if they happen to serve stir-fried green beans with bacon and onion EVERYDAY, then I am more than happy to raise 1 more star on this review and go there twice as often.  On the flip side- the things I would consider avoid -   Beef rib - I have a picture here.  I know it looks tasty but I would stay away from it.  It's always kind of dried.  Pull Pork - This one is a hit and miss so I finally decide to avoid it.  Once a while it gets very wastery so it ruins the taste.  But when it's done right, then it's fine.  Just avoid it.",

As they were walking out I asked them what they thought of the ribs. They said they complained about them and were not charged. The mac and cheese was very good as was the coleslaw. My experience with Dillon's in the past is their sides are always good and their meats are not so good. They seem to have  a problem with service.

They recently started serving a macaroni and cheese, which was awesome.  It has corn and bread crumbs in it and just tastes fantastic.  Ribs are incredible.  Chicken club sandwich is sooo good.  It is a big fried chicken breast, with ham, bacon and cheese.  Holy crap it's good.....You must go to Dillon's right now.  You wont be sorry....",

    "text": "Well the thing that made me not want to come back the most was our terrible waitress. It took 5 minutes to get greeted and asked for our drinks. By that time I had figured out what I wanted to eat. So we order our drinks and say that we will be ready to order in a few minutes to give her time to get our drinks. It took another 5 minutes to get our drinks. She drops them off and then leaves right away to take another tables order. Then 5 minutes later she comes and takes our order. The food comes very fast and it tasted good. So she brings us out a little tiny cup of catsup,  my fiance asks the waitress for more catsup. I wait 5 minutes and walk to the kitchen area and ask for the manager and catsup. The manager comes and says she is sorry and what the problem was I said crappy service. So she gave us 3 five dollar coupons for next time. I dont think there ever will be a next time. Our bill came out to 30.00 for a brisket sand which, and a burger and one tea. Definitely not worth the price that we paid.",

I especially like fresh-fried mushrooms; these guys deliver, and add fresh onion rings and fried pickles to boot.  I'm not crazy about the pickles; I prefer hamburger dill slices in the southern style, but these guys deliver on the house made batter.  It's light, crispy, and their ancho dipping sauce is on point.  This is real barbecue, slow-smoked, and pulled by hand; with sauces as garnish.  Choose from sausage, pulled pork, brisket, St. Louis or baby back ribs, or chicken.  Full bar and good margaritas, and not very expensive at all.  Service:  These are among the cutest, most attentive, younger women in the valley.  Allow for a little youth, and be wowed by their dedication.  Love this place.",

It is a good BBQ restaurant, with a wide menu, friendly staff, and quick service (for the most part). Despite being overrun with white hairs, there is a good mix of families and often it gets really loud in their. The BBQ sauce is tasty and the brisket, pork, and baby back ribs are some of the best you will find over here. It is the type of place you can go to and know you will always have a quality meal- no surprises here. It has become a staple with my family and often a place we take out of town company. With locations in Surprise and 67th and the 101, it is convenient to most of the west-side.",

The stew is quite inexpensive and very tasty.  Not a huge meal but is sufficient as a meal itself.",

Nothing special about the decor, but what do you want? Top notch BBQ or fancy shamcy art? Put this place on your list of must try! They have a decent bar too, so enjoy an icy one with those tips!",

If you're looking for slow service, bad food and a good cleanse, head to Dillons on 87th and Thunderbird.  I had undercooked rubbery fish, my friend had a bland pulled chicken sandwich and deep fried mushrooms that came from a can, (not like the picture).  The temp manager confirmed this!  We waited almost an hour for our lunch, which was crazy considering there where like 8 tables full. This place was once the bomb but, over the years it  has turned from a 5 star to a no star. I'm typically not one to complain but the final insult was the $40.00 bill at the end. Considering both my friend I ended up in the bathroom, I would consider this experience a waist of money, literally!  One last thing, if you want to substitute a side for a salad, it's $1.50 extra. We ordered fish and pulled chicken sandwich, can fried mushrooms, two side salads, a ice tea and lemonade, $40.00. The manager said he wouldn't suggest the chicken and thought the fish didn't look right when it left the kitchen. MMMM?",

They also have deep fried pickles which are sooo soo good.  Addicting.  Their homemade ranch dressing is the bomb.  One other thing this place is known for is the Onion Rings! Get a half order they are humongous!  The prime rib is one of my favorites it has a slightly bacony taste to it.  Overall give dillions a shot.  Its good to take the wife and grandma too!   I  Love this place never had a bad meal.  The Dillons dip is the best french dip sandwich around.  I also love the Beef Ribs and the Chilli is OMG Awesome they put brisket in it! Good for kids too!",

    "text": "It's sad to have to give this place a bad review because for a few years we enjoyed it very much. This was me and my fiance favorite little place to go. Right by our home, beer was always cold and food was great. Until one day we popped into the establishment during the weekend to meet some friends for lunch. We were first to arrive so we grabbed a table in the bar and the waitress came up very sweet and we ordered two beers she asked for our IDs sure no problem! So we hand them to her and she said thank you and ill being those right out! Ya... 15 min later no drinks and mind you it was not busy. Then a lady with dark brown curly hair walks up to our table and literally says \" I need to see your IDs please\" not a hey I'm the manager anything. So a bit taken back we handed our IDs over again! She then proceeded to walk away yes! She walked away with OUR IDs in her hand. We sat that for 20 more minutes still no beer not even a glass of water! Then she comes back to tell my fiance that his ID was fake.... He is 25 years old. Nothing about his ID looked fake I worked myself in a bar and am certified for selling alcohol and I know what they teach you to ID fake cards. She then proceeded to tell us to leave. Not saying we can give you food but we can give you the beer. By this time me and my fiance were in shock and angry a place we have been visiting for so long and have been very loyal customers to. So my fiance told her 1) we are leaving this establishment but we attend to contact management 2) she should of never walked away with our IDs and left us sitting there for a Half hour 3) she needed to watch her attitude with especially for being a manager. She gave attitude to my fiance before he ever became upset. We left this establishment that day and went to another Mexican food restaurant and order a beer again, we proceeded to ask our waiter there if he thinks my fiancees ID was fake. He threw his head back and laughed and said \" who would think this is fake? \". YUP! So end the story we did call management spoke to a GM did the whole deal. We went back in again with a new ID I had my fiance get and this manager was still there. Then came to my table and proceeded to tell us \" Glad you got a new ID However you had a very bad attitude \" and she expected us to apologize to her and told us her hostess said that my fiance was in her class in High school and that's why she didn't serve us. So needless to say GM and owner I believe said it would be taken care of obviously it wasn't. I even tried writing them again and was ignored. I understand being a manager of a restaurant/ bar her behavior was completely out of line. So food is great however staff not so much.",

I didn't want to touch it.  I took a quick glance at the other tables and they all looked the same way.  Eww.  They had a special on onion rings and those were pretty tasty.  I'd score the food a 3 (I had the pulled pork sandwich and they must have put the meat in a bowl and then dumped it on the bun because it stayed in the shape of the bowl and looked like a giant serving of cat food.  That could easily be fixed.  And no one felt like they got enough BBQ sauce, and c'mon!  it is a BBQ restaurant! Someone in our party got a salad and it was garnished with canned peaches.  Looked gross.)  The place had an aura of an assisted living cafeteria.  No thanks.  I won't go back.",

We had the BBQ pulled pork and smoked brisket sandwiches (and split them between us). The brisket was outstanding with a great texture and a pleasing smoky taste, the best I've had. The pork was not spectacular, but not overly fatty and better than most. The BBQ sauce is sweet, not overly complex, but good for dipping the fries into. The servers are young, but friendly and efficient. Will be returning for sure.",

The red sauce that comes with it however is not even close to a good combination in my opinion with this dish. The food was ok. No flavor in anything that I could really taste. Mostly just spicy. The Mac n cheese tasted like velveeta cheese and shells with corn mixed in. He chicken quesadilla had hardly any flavor. Although this was my first time here doesn't mean I'm going to write it off completely. Maybe next time will be better.",

Last visit and this visit the food has been awful.  We both had the chicken fried chicken and both had soggy crust.  I sent mine back and when brought new one it was nice and crisp.  The coleslaw had no flavor, even when I added pepper and hot sauce.  My friend had mashed potatoes and they were cold.  We woukd have left after the poop incident but I had to use groupon before expiration.    I will not be back and the other groupon I will turn in for credit.

    "text": "I've been to this location before. Years ago I used to come to this location for fried pickles for my lunch when I worked at a local retail store. Tonight was not a great experience and honestly I probably won't be back to this particular one.  The girls up front were super friendly. Great start. We were seated in the back room. No issues there. I was waiting for the other person at my table, he was a few minutes away. I didn't have to wait long for someone to come to my table. I ordered a Diet Coke, a Dr. Pepper no ice, and an order of fried pickles with no hot sauce and extra ranch. I even told my server it was why I came there. I got our drinks quickly with ice in both drinks but hey he can live with ice.  Alex sat down and immediately our waiter asked if we were ready to order... no time for Alex to look. Luckily we knew what we wanted. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with sweet bbq sauce and potato salad. Alex ordered a cheeseburger only ketchup with fries. We then waited 20 minutes for food.  Our food came out and our pickles never came. Alex's burger came with just meat and cheese no bun. I told the person that brought it out that he needed a bun, a refill because he sat for 5 minutes without a drink, and we never got our pickles. She said she'd get them. She brought a bun & his drink right away. In the time we waited for the pickles I tried my pulled pork sandwich and they gave me spicy sauce. She brought the pickles and literally ran from our table. The pickles were quite literally skins of pickles fried. Either Dillons has really changed their pickles or I was purposefully given greasy pieces that had no pickles in it. Then our waiter came back and said sorry I didn't know you ordered pickles. I said I literally told you it was why I came here. He said sorry I'm new. I said I understand okay. I asked for sweet sauce to try to cover the hot sauce and because I didn't trust my sandwich to be fixed. We didn't take any of it home. Didn't even get to half of the pickles because the order didn't actually have pickles just fried bits. I didn't eat my sandwich, I just ate the potatoes. Alex are his burger not a fan of the fries. I had one and they weren't bad, nothing to write home about. My waiter brought the check and everything including the pickles, I didn't eat that took forever to get to the table, were on there. I gave him my card and the manager came back with the check and they had taken the pickles off. He didn't apologize just said because of what happened they took them off. I tipped him based on the order with pickles at 20% because he's new. He might be new but no one else tried to help him or make it better. The pickles were a horrible disappointment. I hope our waiter learns to listen because the only thing he got correct was my Diet Coke.",

It was a good-sized salad with plenty of meat and the chicken breast was fried perfectly. I ordered blue cheese dressing on the side but also some of their barbecue sauce because their sauce is wonderful. It came with a roll on the side along with their cinnamon butter that I love. The people I was with both ordered burgers with fries and they looked good as well. Service was very fast and we were out of there in no time at all. Our waitress was very nice and even asked us if we wanted iced teas to go. Great service, great food, what more can you ask for?!",

Our waitress did not try to deny that what she got was fish and not chicken. They offered to replace the dish, but we find it disturbing that two members of the waitstaff were unwilling to take our word for it when my wife said it was fish. The rest of my wife's meal had almost no flavor to it. The potato salad was good, but the french fries weren't fresh the first time and the second time they weren't cooked.",

    "text": "Like anyone else I appreciate locally owned and operated places, and I wish Dillons all the success in the world (I found their service both friendly and fast), but seriously, this BBQ sucks.   I had pork spare ribs and brisket because these are the two most difficult cuts to get right. Texturally, the brisket was fine, if a bit dry. The ribs were underdone (the bones did not come clean as they should when properly prepared, and they were tough because of this). The ribs and the brisket both had only the slightest hint of smoke flavor... they were seriously undersmoked.   To top it off, their sauces (mild and \"cajun\" - which is not hot at all, though I suspect they cater to the Sun City palate) were both savory sauces dominated by the flavor of mustard and vinegar. How anybody can judge either of these sauces delicious is a mystery to me. I found them both horrible.   One bite of each meat was all I could manage.   Sides were a mixed bag. The mac and cheese was delicious (thank you, thank you!) - but the baked beans were chili beans and were... gross. I suspect they were made using the sauce, so it's not terribly surprising I didn't like them. I had their chicken wings as an appetizer, they were pretty good. They are prepared like fried chicken and come with the sauce on the side. It was agreeably hot and delicious... but then again, it wasn't BBQ.",

Occasionally service may be a bit slower than usual, but unless I'm being completely ignored, I'm not too put off by it.  I first went here off of the recommendation of someone who told me I HAD to try the chicken fried steak. However, sitting down and looking at the menu, I realized that ordering a chicken fried steak in a BBQ joint would be akin to ordering a hamburger in a Mexican food restaurant. Not even going there!  Items I can say without a doubt are great: Pulled pork (moist and slightly smoky), turkey (thinly sliced but a great smoked flavor), smoked sausage (although it doesn't stand out above other smoked sausages elsewhere, it's still good), and ribs (I'm not a huge rib person, but they are tasty and flavorful).  My absolute favorite, must get is the burnt ends. I am a fan of huge smoke flavor and these tasty brisket ends don't disappoint! Strangely enough, the brisket itself is probably the one item on the menu I'm not a huge fan of.  The BBQ Sauce, you ask? I'm a fan of the cajun style (slightly kicky and not too sweet), which is Dillon's original sauce. The sweet and mild sauce was created for the Sun City crowd who requested a milder sauce, and the name describes it about perfectly.  The sides I've had are all pretty good, although I usually stick with a potato product and beans - why mess with something that works for you?  As others have mentioned, this is very near Sun City, expect early crowds.   And one other thing? I have yet to try the chicken fried steak.",

Plenty of sides, green beans and mashed potatoes. Not something I'd regularly eat - but it was really good! My hubby had a brisket sandwich with steak fries and beans. He loved it.  Our waiter was awesome, I think his name was Austin. There's a also a cute Bunny hutch out back that you can see while you are eating. I love animals, so I thought it was a cute touch.

Great spareribs, good baby backs, decent brisket although it has an overall tendency sometimes to be a bit dry/overcooked. Sauces are great!  BBQ beans side is very good, rich and has a fair amount of beef in it too. Cole slaw is good, although sometimes I have noticed it needed to be marinated a tad bit more. Even their sandwiches tend to be very good, big portions, great flavors, although a bit pricy.   Service at this location is very good also. Servers are pleasant, attentive, and seem happy to work here.   If someone thinks overall there is a better BBQ restaurant company in the valley, then I would like to know where it is, because Dillon's is very, very, good.",

    "text": "Called in a take out order for my first try here.  The are reasonably priced take out by the pound, but actually ended up getting my order wrong (even though it was correct on my receipt).  Because of this I only got to try the brisket, which I have to give 2 stars.  At a solid BBQ place, the brisket should be easy to eat and smokey good.  The issue here is that it was neither.  You have to cover the brisket in sauce to give it a good taste and on top of that it was hard and chewy.  Seems like in Sun City it would at least be critical to have meat that isn't hard, my grandmother really couldn't eat it as it was too hard to chew up.  I ended up cutting it up into small pieces to freeze and save for a stew or something at a later date.",

    "text": "I have been to this Dillon's location several times over the past 3 or 4 years and I have never been disappointed.  The food is great, the servers are nice and the price is reasonable.  Another factor is the beer is very affordable.  The selection at the Arrowhead location is a little better for those who enjoy craft beers, but if you are ok with the normal light beers and Amber Bock then this location will do.    I usually get the ribs or burnt ends.  The burnt ends are very tender, never dried out and big.  The BBQ sauces are great, you get a choice of three.  The ribs sometimes don't have enough smoke, but the meat falls of the bone and still has great flavor.  My wife goes for the half chicken and she has never complained.    The layout of the restaurant is awkward, they have added on and it doesn't flow the best and the decor is outdated, but it is definitely family friendly dining.  Our 8 month old fits right in and if he gets noisy, you cannot hear him as the place gets fairly loud when busy.    Check it out for the BBQ items, I haven't ventured to the sandwiches.",

    "text": "This is a meat place close to Sun City so dinner at 5 last night was quite appropriate.   Dillon's is decent fresh food in a casual environment. Good for groups, efficient wait staff and big portions. The man was on a brisket kick and since this was a BBQ joint, figured he would try it. It is Kansas style and it was nice and tender BBQ-though not quite \"smoked\" and definitely sliced on a meat slicer.  The daughter had a pulled pork sandwich that was tender and delicious. The Grandmother had a brisket sandwich, there are other offerings as well-fried chicken, chicken fried steak, fish, etc. Salads are good as are the onion rings they ordered for appetizers. This is no BBQ joint. This is a family restaurant with decent food and decent service.  I am giving 4 stars again mostly due to the great service we have. For some reason, AZ is still ass backwards when it comes to recognizing waitstaff. They are not paid minimum wage (though I am not sure how this is legal). They make about $3.25 per hour from the establishment (this is up from $2.12 two years ago) and the rest is supposed to come out of tips. Any young person willing to work in the Sun City area and depend on tips and actually works really hard to get them deserves a whole star to themselves (oh and an extra tip behind the chintzy tippers in my family here).  Reservations are only taken for a party of 8 or more.",

    "text": "Oh Dillon's.  I once, mistakenly took this guy that I was seeing to Dillon's.  See, we hadn't really talked much about our eating habits as it was our second or third date (and we'd just met for drinks before this date) but he had marked \"meat and potatoes\" in his on-line profile.  I'm not a meat and potatoes girl as I am Pakistani and these things are inherent to American culture but I was keen on satisfying his supposed love for meat and potatoes.  In order to truly grasp this situation, you have to know that this guy was from the East Valley and kind of a snob because of it- I know that the West Valley has a long way to go (but I live and work here and have to be positive so shut up!) and am not denying that.  We had only hung out in the East Valley, and it was my turn to try and let the West Valley shine.  Anyway, I was freaking out because I don't know Phoenix that well and don't eat meat and potatoes.  So, I called a good friend who is a Phoenix native and she instantly thought \"DILLONS!\" when I said meat and potatoes.  She was, of course right on, if one is really into meat and potatoes.  It turns out that the guy I was seeing wasn't really into meat and potatoes and hadn't thought much about his profile when he had filled it out.  I felt like a total freak, as he told me he enjoyed Thai and all kinds of stuff that I actually enjoy.  This led to a bit of an awkward albeit fun time at Dillon's.    We opted to sit outside as it was a nice evening.  Unfortunately, the patio area gives you clear view of some abandoned trailer and a large overgrown field.  Not exactly romantic or cool.   We ordered a bottle of red wine when we sat down and the waitress was clearly miffed by this.  I'm pretty positive she had been working there for years and no one had actually ordered a bottle of wine.  It also took a very long time for the wine to be delivered to us, so we were sure that someone had to run out to the local Circle K to get us our bottle of wine.    I ended up ordering the spinach enchiladas (I know, lame) and he ordered a salmon salad.  Although the food was decent, I'd probably only suggest this restaurant to a big meat eater.  Which apparently wasn't either of us.  I totally let the West side down by showcasing Dillon's to an East Valley snob.  Argh.",

The Waitress came by with our beverages, but completely disappeared as we waited and...and waited...and waited to give her our order....(by this time, we could had driven over to FAMOUS DAVE'S in the amount of time it took for her to reappear!) There were only 3 other customers in the whole place, so it wasn't crazy busy (and there was ANOTHER Food Server on duty too).  Anyhow....  I usually order their Pulled Pork, which is never disappointing. However, after seeing Adam Richman (Man Vs Food) eating some BBQ brisket on a recent episode, I suddenly wanted brisket too!  The brisket was nicely rolled on a bun (like a spiral lollipop) and looked quite pretty, but was NOT as moist as the Pulled Pork.  It was dry. The homemade potato salad is ALWAYS a winner! The overall portions seemed skimpy for the price ($8 or $9 bucks) for a sandwich and 1 side. (For less money, I could had gone to a Buffet to pig-out and not have to wait for a SLOW Food Server...)   Took awhile to get the check too...ugh! Not everyone who eats there has HOURS to sit there waiting and waiting.   If you want good portions for a good value...this is NOT the place to visit.  Slow service and dry brisket will remind me to chose someplace else for lunch next time. ..",

So we ventured over to Dillion' s on Saturday afternoon, since one of my favorite meals is Pulled Pork, and Dillon's was right down the street.    We only had to wait a few minutes and got a table right away.  The atmosphere is understated... not really a place to bring your first date as there is no romantic ambiance here, just rolls of paper towels on each table for those truly dedicated to making a mess.  If you come here, it's for the food.  And it's worth coming here for the food.  I love BBQ, and this is one of the best I have found in Phoenix so far.  My son commented that they had some of the best ribs he had ever eaten (and he's tried a lot). I also noticed that you could buy the pulled pork, chicken, or brisket by the pound to go... already thinking about it for the first week of football.  If you are on the west side and hankering for some BBQ, give it a shot!",

We ordered the Prime Beef Rib platter for $25 which came with a 10oz prime rib, and two sides of which we chose the mashed potatoes and mac'n'cheese. You can choose a larger cut, and there are plenty of other sides to choose from. I ordered it medium rare. Everything was decent but nothing spectacular. It was all cooked well, just lacked flavor.  But our server was fantastic! She took care of us right away, was very friendly, and always checked on us!  We sat in the same room as the bar and there was a jukebox. Every song is $1 which to me seems like a lot. 50c or 25c would be well worth it.  The onion rings were the best part as far as food goes. They fry thick rings. These are complimentary and given to 1st time customers, just let them know it's your 1st time in.  The dessert on the other hand tasted old or at least the cream did, it had a funny taste to it. It was the Salted Caramel Vanilla Crunch Cake slice and it was $7.",

That is why THIS LOCATION of Dillons hits the spot for us when I have a craving for GOOD barbeque and I don't have 12 hours to babysit the grill and my meat!! The other locations of Dillions might be newer and fancier, but they do NOT put the same love into their food as this particular location!! If you have been to the other locations of Dillons and have been disappointed, don't judge this location by that experience!!! There IS a difference!!

We have 3 kids with us that are starving, so it's not like we have a massive party. If we ever get to sit and eat I'll let you know how the food it.  The food was amazing but just the way the manager talked to my wife was completely unnecessary. Might go back. Sorry but customer service should be priority number one.",

As we were panicking and trying to figure out what to do, my husband called dillons because they were two miles away and he knew they catered.  When my husband told them what happened the girl on the phone was super nice and helped us figure out how we can feed 50 people in 1.5 hours. Great job dillons for saving our party!

Our pulled pork sandwiches were served very quickly and we soon found the reason why--the meat was not very hot and the bun had been microwaved and so was rather mushy (not crisp) and thus it was impossible to eat as a sandwich. (The flavor was fine, tho) The cole slaw also had an \"off\" taste, as if it was rather old and not at all fresh. Very disappointed!",

Her bra straps were showing in the back that revealed her huge tattoo on her left shoulder and a pierced lip too.  We were all distracted at our table.  Then she came to our table to remove our appetizer plates.  She leaned over right in front of my husband's face.  This isn't Hooters, at least I don't think it was.

I called on the phone. It was ready in 15 minutes.   The hosts were fantastic gals. They even checked my meal with me to make sure that I got the right order. However, I did have to come back to pick up my drinks, but they caught that I left my credit card so that makes us even.  2 kids meals for $17 and change. The meals came with 4 ribs, choice of barbecue sauce (mild, Cajun or spicy), Smiley Face fries and a small drink. When I got home, the kids were happy, and mom felt like a winner. Thanks, Dillon's BBQ!  p/s I was impressed that they had plenty of handicapped parking. They also had a nice curbside parking area. Cute decor, but it cannot beat the Wildlife Dillon's where you can dine with the sharks.",

Nice and crisp with a bowl of red hot sauce to dip them in.  The Devil sandwich was whack.  Some pulled pork with the SAME red hot sauce that came with the wings.  A guy can only eat so much Franks red hot sauce at one meal.  I must have misunderstood.  I thought it was some type of homemade hot bbq sauce.  I must have been thinking of Devil's spit from Famous Daves...speaking of famous daves I think next time I want bbq I will go there.  Dillons is just ok for me.  My wife had the catfish and liked it.  She also loved her potato salad.  My bbq beans were pretty tasty I must say.  I would say thumbs up to the wings and sides and just a meh to the rest.    The inside was extremely loud from the drunks in the karaoke bar next to us.  Not sure how they can be that drunk already seems how it wasn't even 7 pm yet.  Between the loud horrible singing and the fly that wouldn't leave our table the experience wasn't enjoyable.  Had I known it was that kind of a bbq I probably wouldn't have taken my one year old.  Guess you have to make money where you can and the bar was packed.  We just ate quickly and got out of there before the country songs came on.",

Back in the day when the menu was smaller and their meat platters came with garlic bread twists this was one of my favorites. Does anyone remember the bread twists? Oh those were awesome!   The BBQ here is alright.. not bad, not great.. just stuck somewhere in the middle.

I also added a house salad.I chose to have all 3 bbq sauces on the side and loved them all. The bread would have been better if it was warmed and the green beans were a little too cooked for  me, but it was still overall a great dish.   The salad came out quickly and comes with croutons, egg and bacon. I wish there was a Fat Free salad dressing option, but at least they gad low cal Italian. The salad was huge and very good.

Tip: If your pulled pork or chicken sandwich comes smothered in sauce it's because they are hiding something.    A True bbq place would put sauce on the side so you can taste the smokiness of the meat before drenching it in sauce.    Now the sauce was good and chicken was tender on my sandwich and the bbq beans were great but I just would like to try the smokey meat before to taste how good it is and how juicy it is prior to sauce.    Will I go back maybe but for sure I won't go out of my way there are too many other places in town that offer above average bbq.",

I tried the spinach enchiladas with chips and salsa.  I was hoping to be wowed and unfortunately wasn't.  I mean what was I thinking, a vegetarian in a BBQ establishment?  I found solace in that fact that even though Dillion's is known for their BBQ there were a variety of options for vegetarians.  Next time I will try the Prickly Peach Salad oh and the fried pickles.  With that said the rest of my party raved about the pork pulled sandwich :)",

They were tough and seemed undercooked. He had great difficulty in getting them off the bone. $25 for the ribs...a rip-off. The baby back pork ribs were good, and fell off the bone. I would go elsewhere for ribs.",

The pulls pork sandwich is my favorite, juicy and flavorful. You can pick your sauce to top it off with. The homemade style Mac and cheese is good. I felt as if I was at my grandmothers eating a hearty meal  The beer selection is poor, consisting of your typical bud light draft with a San tan beer or four peaks thrown in. Nothing out of the ordinary. What the bar does offer is live music on Fridays with no cover.",

We had a lovely dinner at Dillon's, they modified a salad I wanted and left off the \"simple green\" spray that preserves lettuce. and keeps it green longer. Found out most restaurants use it but I am allergic, so any fruit or veggie dish was off limits for me... Dillon's accommodated my issue and opened a new bag to make my salad and made sure no simple green was added to my plate.. thanks for making a special day even better.  I told my hubby we were going back....Thank  You for a wonderful dinner, and lunch tomorrow too.",

My husband and I were a little concerned that it was going to be a bad experience because of the latest posts...it was NOT!!  Though it is by far not \"elegant\", it is however, super country cute.  We were greeted and sat.  And immediately waited on by (I believe) Alyssa--she was charming and sweet.  I can understand some of the reviews saying that they cater to a \"certain crowd\".  Fine.  Alyssa did an AWESOME job taking care of my 65 year old parents, asking exact questions and making sure their orders were correct and catered to their needs!!  This really makes me happy.   And I can understand it takes a lot of patience, but she did it with ease!!    They have a FULL menu, but it's the BBQ that was our agenda.  Super succulent shredded pork, juicy pork ribs, ridiculously HUGE beef ribs, and the sides (I think between the 4 of us, we had them all) were very rich and tasty (mac-n-cheese and potato salad were off the hook!!). Their iced tea was FRESH and my mom's soda was perfectly bubbly!!  We were given take-out containers with bags and were allowed to sit a little while so we could catch up! We had such an excellent lunch and visit with one another.  Thanks Dillon's Thunderbird Crew!!  And THANK YOU ALYSSA!!!  Post Script: *Parking goes fast. *The prices were completely affordable. *The bar looks like a HUGE PLUS!! *They are wheel-chair friendly. *They have adorable \"bibs\" for the \"ribs.\"  *And the unheard of: the other customers were friendly and generous--the kind woman next to us picked up MY napkin and gave it to me!!!  Who does that???!!!  GOOD PEOPLE DO!!!",

Burnt ends were just chopped brisket plopped on plate with sauce dumped on top.  Where's the love.   Make an effort.  Ordered the sausage which was more like a hot dog in bbq sauce.  Yuck.  The brisket was the best thing at our table.  Mac n cheese creamy and comforting but tasteless.  Steak fries were good.  Cinnamon butter interesting but the roll was not.  Service/waitress was pretty good.  Coolest part was the large turtle or tortoise right outside our window.  Hope it was just a bad night in the kitchen, just sorry I paid for it with my family.

The potato salad was a disappointing blob of dressing/sour cream with another heavy dose of salt.  Neither one of us could eat it. The fish WAS cooked nicely in terms of done-ness - just couldn't handle the salty and peppery overdose.    Guess what was good? The broccoli!  Great job on the broccoli - but I didn't pay for a few spears of veggies!   Maybe I will try a different Dillon's.",

Finally figured out it was BBQ and after some random shopping adventures, the bff and I were ready for some BBQ.    We walked in and the place was pretty full!  The decor is...interesting...very \"grandma's living room\" but makes you feel at home.  I couldn't decide between the brisket sandwich or the pulled pork so I asked our server.  He immediately said the brisket was his top choice.  So I went for it.    I do not regret it.  I asked for 2 different sauces on the side.  Yes! Finally a place that just gives you the brisket sliced thinly and sauce on the side! Just like my dad does it!   Their cajun BBQ sauce is perfection! Not too spicy, but more than flavorful!  The brisket is very tender and flavorful...also VERY LEAN! The bun is soft and not at all too bready...sorry, but a bready bun just ruins the sandwich! I'm there for the meat, not for the bread ;-)  I really enjoyed dinner and will definitely be going back!  If you can, ask to sit by the window facing their little \"garden\"!  You might have a few of 3 of the cutest bunnies you've ever seen...might I add that they are HUGE bunnies!  So cute just hopping around! Was definitely a bonus! hehehe",

Yes, I know football season has been over for a while but diets, cash flow and life in general, on both sides, made this dinner wait.  Suffice it to say the company was worth the wait.  When we got there about 6:30 on Saturday the parking lot was packed and we were worried we would be stuck in the bar with our growling stomachs.  It turned out we were seated immediately although there were only a few tables open.  We started with a half order of onion rings.  These are hand made in house and served with a really good dipping sauce.  Both the rings and the sauce reminded me of Lenny's (which got rid of their sauce and started buying frozen onion rings) only one notch higher.  We were both thinking ribs in a BBQ joint and she got the baby backs and I got the St Louis style spare ribs.  She got the fall off the bone she wanted and I got the slightly chewy I wanted.  Of the sauces I preferred the cajun which was only mildly hot, however the ribs were good enough they really didn't need much sauce.  We both ordered different sides so we could try many of them.  We liked them all but my favorites were the cole slaw and the macaroni and cheese.  The only soso item was the dinner roll but even there they are smart enough to serve soft butter.  The service was attentive without being obtrusive the entire time.  Our waitress had the answers to all of our questions without having to go ask.  Sort of an anomaly in the North West valley, you can arrive here between 7:30 and 8:30 and the place will be sort of quiet between the Sun City folks and the later night crowd and be seated right away.",

I would say the decor was out of date. They seriously need a restaurant makeover. We finally got seated.  Our server, Miss Corona was great. She seemed tired, but still served us with genuine effort. Out party was of seven, and she got all of our orders right. She was not rude at all and did not pout when we asked for several things.  I ordered the beef brisket platter with a loaded potato and wedge salad for my side. My brisket was kind of dry. My loaded potato was delicious. The wedge salad was tasty. Overall, decent food.   After a good hour, our meal came to an end. She dropped off the check with no rush. We left the place, still being treated with good customer service all the way out the door.   Overall, Dillons BBQ was a cozy family atmosphere.",

I had no idea the bar servers are lacking in serving! After we finally get our drinks we ordered some onion rings extra ranch! The rings come no extra ranch and no small plates to eat! When she decides to come back and offer small plates we were already done! We ordered the pulled chicken bad mistake! She never did ask what sauce we wanted so when the plate comes I mention that and her reply is oh well I didn't offer and you didn't ask! We get our sweet heat sauce and the pulled chicken there has no comparison to the pulled pork! They should just take that off the menu! Didn't even finish it it's so gross! Not sure we will ever be back! If we ever go there again I will be sure that Latisha is not our server!",

    "text": "After seven years or more, we were in the area and decided to take my brother to check out AZ barbecue.   There is a problem with long delays between meals. It is still a decent place to eat but we remember it as better. My wife's 50/50 ribs were good but the ribs were low on meat.  I had a two meat combo: sausage and beef brisket.  The barbecue sauce was good. The beans, ok, and the cole slaw average.  The beer selection is much better.  We enjoyed Deschutes Fresh Hop IPA.   I wouldn't avoid this place but won't go out of my way.  I did hear back from someone in management after a couple of weeks. I appreciate the response. The suggestion regarding rib quality was that we  contact the manager but we aren't the customers that make an issue of everything.  Before my father-in-law passed away in 2009, we were here several times each year.  We liked the place.  There seems to be an issue but when we return (and we will) we hope it will be better.",

When our food came out, it was cold! Not just \"it sat in the window a little too long\" but actually cold in temperature like it was cooked yesterday and put right in the plate! Mashed potatoes cold - burnt ends cold - brisket cold, baked potato cold!!! We sent back one plate and asked for another potato on the side. Clearly it was just put in the microwave because when the potato came out it was so hot it scalded my mouth!  Anyways - flavor was just ok  But the drinks were good and Eileen did her best to make things right.",

They are not worthy!    I got the pick three with:   Burnt ends(dry and barely fit for dog food),   Turkey(tasted like a horrible thanksgiving bird or just thick sliced lunch meat.  Who serves BBQ with gravy for God's sake?)  Brisket(This is probably the same meat they serve on the roast beef subs at subway, only thicker sliced.  No smokey flavor whatsoever.)  The three sauces offered were either bitter, sweet, or bittersweet.  On a great positive, the sides that myself and my lovely companion enjoyed are most likely available at any Walmart deli, or the aisle with Bush's baked beans.  No, seriously,  the onion rings were amazing.  Good for one appetizer, happy hour drinks and get the hell out!  The server was awesome, and the manager tried to take care of me earlier in the meal.  I'm just not the type to make a scene in public over food.  When I did mention that the brisket and turkey were like lunch meat with no smokey flavor, I was told that they cater to an older clientele and can't add much smoke flavor.",
