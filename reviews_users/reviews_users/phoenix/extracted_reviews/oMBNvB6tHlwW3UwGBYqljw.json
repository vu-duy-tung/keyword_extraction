I ordered beef bowl teriyaki but the beef teriyaki is a lil bit over cooked and the smell of the burning beef just overwhelmed me. The Panko breaded fish plate is the one that I recommend to try. They also have the seaweed salad which I found good. And they also charged for the soda refill $.30",

    "text": "The Blue Fin is a place I have probably driven by 100 times, either coming/going to work or heading to the library. I didn't even realize it was actually open until I got onto Yelp and saw some reviews. So close to my office, I had to try it out.....on a Sunday when it was closed. Oops. Let's try this again, for lunch  The place ain't big, so make sure you get there early, especially if you have more than 4 people. I also noticed they had their iced tea and lemonade in massive buckets, which is the ONLY way to serve beverages in my humble opinion. Quite like a lot of places in the area, the Blue Fin has a massive amount of pictures of their food up on the wall, so it does make choosing a meal that much more easy. A quick moving line and a 5 minute wait later, I had my teriyaki chicken bowl and was back to the office.  First off, this is a pretty big meal for the price. It's a great lunch option for what you pay for. Having said that, it's not great. The rice was a little over-cooked, which I actually like, but some people may be put off by, especially with how sticky it was. The chicken itself was good, but also had been either cooked or sat under a heat lamp for too long. Damn the salmonella, I want my chicken cooked just enough to stop clucking!! The sauce was very good though, and really brought the meal together.  Overall, it's a solid place for the price. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there when I am not downtown, but I am sure to head back during a busy lunch hour. Worth the visit",

My fiancee at the time (whom I've been married to for 15 years now) took me to this place one afternoon. He worked in the downtown area so he was familiar with all the good eats. Surprisingly our food was great. As the years roll by, I take our kids and we sit at the same spot that my husband and I sat during our date 15 years ago. We order the same entree too, lol. This place has several entrees to choose from. My favorite is the Teriyaki Chicken. I know it sounds plain but don't judge a book by it's cover. It's a small hole in the wall but it's clean and not run down. The owners have maintained the business very well. Go to their website for a complete listing of their entrees. By the way, try the Mochi dessert. I don't know whats in it but I LIKE IT ALOT...",

    "text": "The Teriyaki Beef Bowl & the fried dumplings (Gyoza) are very good and very reasonably priced. The Panko Fish is also quite tasty, but I've had better fish at other nearby places (like Karim's) so I wouldn't bother to go to Blue Fin for fish. I've also had the Chicken Teriyaki Bowl before, but didn't find it too tasty. Coworkers have commented to me that the other chicken dishes are not to their liking, so perhaps this is a weak point for them.    Your best bet is to pick the food up to go as the inside is very small (and not aesthetically pleasing) and the place gets quite busy during lunch time. The food here is decent and the food reasonably cheap so we keep going back, but it's not really high on my list of preferred Asian places.   P.S. This place seems to attract a lot of Phoenix's redneck population (though I don't know why), so just be prepared if that sort of thing puts you off!",

Plus, they've got great food too.  My usual choice is either the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl or their eight piece California rolls and Miso Soup. All great, affordable and fast. It can get pretty busy there, so it is nice that you can call in your order ahead of time, and pick it up at walk-up/drive-through window.    The Blue Fin is a little out of the way from where I work, but it is always a treat when I order out. And of course, being greeted with a warm smile and a friendly \"hello\" is also a big plus in my book.",

    "text": "Since I love sushi and have been eating all varieties of Asian food since high school, I tend to avoid ordering teriyaki dishes when I go to Japanese restaurants. Not only do I find the teriyaki sauce that Japanese places typically use to be too sweet, but there is always so much - sushi, edamame, seaweed salads - at good Japanese places that I would rather spend my money on and fill my stomach with. Going forward, Blue Fin will be an exception to this no-teriyaki rule of mine. In fact, I may even go there *because* of the teriyaki.   My husband and I stopped in for lunch. We both ordered the teriyaki combos (served with salad and rice) - he got beef and I got the white-meat chicken. Both were priced around $6. The food took a while to come out, and there were no seats left inside, so we had to sit outside, but the owner/manager was super nice, offering to re-seat us inside when tables became available and to bring us our food when it was ready.   When she brought our plates, we were shocked at how huge the portions were. Yes, there was tons of salad (with a delicious sesame dressing) and white rice, but there was also a *lot* of meat. My husband and I believe ourselves to have larger-than-average appetites, but we could barely finish one plate and vowed to split one next time. So, the portions were huge, but the teriyaki flavor was also amazing. It was subtle and flavorful but not too sweet, serving to bring out the flavor of the meat and not just provide a sticky and overwhelming glaze. The black sesame seeds and spicy powder they put on the table were nice add-ons but weren't even necessary since the sauce was so flavorful. I am, however, docking The Blue Fin a star because the quality of my husband's beef wasn't as high as that of the chicken; it was fatty and hard to chew.   After years of avoiding teriyaki, The Blue Fin makes me actually crave it. Plus, it's affordable and has a super-friendly staff. I will definitely be back.",

Top that off with some majorly delicious Japanese food, and that's The Blue Fin.  I had the Katsu Pork and I have to tell ya, it's just like my mother's.  Their food is made fresh and their sushi is made daily.  It's made the old fashioned Japanese way, not like the kind you get at Fry's Grocery Store.  Their prices are also very reasonable.

With the light rail going down Central, if you are not on the right side of the road you have to go about a quarter of a mile to turn around. Traffic was light so no problem. Painted blue and white. Very bright colors shows up well. Gives you the welcome feel. It not really a sushi bar. They specialize in teriyaki but they do have two offerings of sushi on the menu. The place is small with seating inside and outside also. Since it is still warn in Phoenix this time of year I decided to eat inside. This place is maybe the cleanest place I have visited. It was so clean it almost hurt the eyes. No dust or dirt anywhere. Service was as good as it gets. I ordered a teriyaki rice bowel and since I wanted some sushi the spicy tuna roll and ice tea.  The cashier called over a employee and gave them my cup to be filled with ice tea. I could of gotten the tea but this is part of their service. My teriyaki bowel was delivered first. The food was good and really more there than one person needs to eat. My sushi came. It was also good. Then came more customer service. The lady that had filled my cup with tea was back asked if I needed more tea. I said yes and away she went with my cup. She refilled it with ice and then the tea. The owner then came up and asked if everything was ok. Nice touch.  A lot of the people coming in and out must eat there often as they were greeted with hello (their name).  So how was the food? The food was good and plentiful and inexpensive.  Would I go back? I have told many people about this place and if I was in the area, yes I would go back. The customer service was the best I have ever seen in a fast food establishment. Many places could learn a lot by going in and experiencing this good customer service.",

Well, not to overcrowd this little spot which is usually busy enough, but I have to sing their praises a little bit. Blue Fin serves very good, healthful Japanese food and is run by some of the sweetest people you'll ever meet (thanks Howard and Betsy!)  I've tried many things on the menu and it's all very tasty. However there's one dish that I always go back for and find myself craving - the white meat teriyaki chicken. Yes, I know, teriyaki is the most common Japanese dish in America, but Blue Fin's is simply awesome.   Most restaurants serve teriyaki as chicken with commercially-made sauce squeezed on top. But Blue Fin marinates their chicken in a homemade teriyaki that's just incredible. It's a big serving and I rarely leave any on the plate. Order it with the salad and it's even better - the best asian salad dressing beside's flo's asian kitchen. And sprinkle on some of the spicy seasoning that's on the table, too. hard to beat it.  Only drawback lately is all the construction around the area, but hey that's downtown these days. And we're lucky Blue Fin is still there - the city had planned to buy and demolish the building, but customers put up such a fuss they decided to let them stay. Hurray for democracy! And hurray for Blue Fin!",

One of the places that has been here for as long as I can remember, yes seriously that long! Is The Blue Fin. I remeber thinking 30 years ago ,I wonder how long this place will be here.  Yet here it stands in 2013 still going strong. Which makes me really happy.  I love when local business can do great!  They have always been great ,very friendly service and fresh food. The panko breaded items are light and feel healthy. All the vegetables I get here are  always crisp and fresh. I guess it is because, they take pride in the place. Something you do not always see. I believe that they have lunch specials every week day. However , they do charge extra for the little things. Like making it extra spicy is like .35 extra and brown rice is a little extra, I mean barley enough to where you would even notice.  They have soup, and sushi, salad,etc. Lots of nice cool drinks. If the weather is cooler(below 90) you can sit outside and enjoy the light rail going by. Which also means that you can take the light rail here as well. It is located in the same spot as always, right next to the Phoenix, Public Library. When in downtown Phoenix, give it a try.",

When I first walked in, I was a little disappointed, but after starring at the menu for a couple of seconds, I actually got excited. When I was in NY a couple of months ago, I went to this great Japanese curry place that was a hole in the wall and had the best Japanese curry I have ever tried.  I searched for something similar when I got back to Phoenix without success. So when I was standing there I saw Japanese curry on the menu and got super excited.  I ordered a bowl of that- the chicken wasn't the chicken katsu, but regular cooked chicken with carrots. It was pretty good but not what my taste buds searching for. I hate when I eat something great on vacation and cannot find it anywhere back home...  Nevertheless, I hope to be back to try  the teriyaki and other things on their menu.",

    "text": "I do find it ironic for a place named the blue fin to not have blue fin on the menu.  I went here today with my co worker for lunch. We found a spot in back with no issue, just make sure you head north on central to get here as the light rail makes entry from south bound impossible.  I ordered the vegetable yaki soba with tofu, and then took a seat at the front patio. Our food was borough to us only a few minutes later.   I tried a bit or two with out the addition of condiments, it was a bit bland and the tofu was much softer than I like. After adding copious amounts of black sesame seeds and red pepper the dish took on new life. The texture contrast of the seeds with the tofu worked and the spices stuck well to the noodles. The vegetables them self were plain, sliced carrots, cabbage, broccoli and celery.   My co worker had the panco chicken, which was just sliced fried chicken on rice, they were nice and gave him every sauce to try.   The food was decent, not the best, not the worst, the value was acceptable as well and the staff was friendly. I will be back, no huge rush however.",

But they use the same chopped up chicken they use for teriyaki I think. So if you expect a True Japanese Oyako, this isn't quite it. With that said - I'm being picky because I'm Japanese. Eggs should be somewhat runny and mine was completely scrambled dry like you get in Mexican burritos.   5 stars for service and 4 stars for food quality :-)",

I hope I see this restaraunt around when I send my kids to school downtown, because they are consistent, they are incredibly friendly, and clean. It's nice to still feel like you're getting a home cooked meal from a neighbor, and you get that here.  Also -- they have red bean paste Mochi, for any interested. Just ask. It's tasty!",

The chicken was decent, not really the best I've had but certainly not the worst. For the price I'm not complaining. 3 maybe 4 stars... but then the service. As we sat outside one of the owners came out to greet us, chatted a bit and took our large cup to refill it for us. Her smile was pleasant enough but her warm inviting attitude and complete joy to hear we tried her restaurant for the first time was wonderful.

Not what I was expecting. I did contact the manager, And explain my expectations versus what was delivered. She mentioned that her chef was from Japan and this is how he prepared it. I have never seen it this way ever! She did trade out both items for teriyaki dishes, but both of those were again, not so good.

I usually got the chicken teriyaki, but have started branching out into the Panko Fish and some kind of pork/egg bowl.  Both were very good.  You can get a bowl of your meat with rice, or upgrade to a plate that comes with rice and salad.  I like to chat with the daughter, who graduated from MIT and has a wit that is refreshing to experience.  They also have fresh sushi rolls that I've had upon occasion.",

What we found was one of the nicest people we have ever met and a great restaurant! My wife ordered the chicken katsu which is called panko chicken here which she enjoyed and got nice portions. I got the chicken curry which after the owner let me know that for $2 more she would double the size. Which i promptly did and got a nice helping of food. It's very comfy home style cooking. I can't say enough good things about thw owner she was very friendly and engaged in conversation with everyone. The prices are incredibly reasonable! Highly recommend it!",

For around $5 you can get a big bowl of rice and teriyaki chicken, for a dollar more, beef or fish. The panko chicken is excellent and comes with a choice of three sauces. My girlfriend's favourite is the vegetable bowl, which comes in under $5! She loves it. Appetizers are also inexpensive - 4 gyoza with pork or shrimp for under $1.79 and 3 spring rolls for $1.39. The sushi is a bit boring, although again, very inexpensive.  The service is amazing - personable, engaging and friendly. Decor is a bit dated, but that doesn't bother me. I'd rather the prices stay low than pay a premium for fancy booths and a mural of Mount Fuji.  I only wish they stayed open a little later than 6:30....",

I am a creature of habit so I get the same thing every week: A spicy all white meat teriyaki chicken bowl ($6). The portion is SO big. I have never been to any restaurant that actually over serves the meat portion. I typically find myself wanting a little more rice to finish all the chicken with. I love the way the chicken is cooked and the spicy teriyaki is just the right amount of spice.   I will also sometimes splurge and get some dumplings ($2 with tax) which always come out very hot and taste great with their soy based sauce. It's not a traditional dumpling sauce that I love but it's still pretty good with the dumplings.  The service at this restaurant though is what pushes me to give them a top notch rating. The people here are just such genuinely nice people. They are very helpful and they get your food out quick. I really do not have one con for this place. The prices are amazing for what they offer, the staff reminds me of my own family and they treat you like you are their family and the food is always fresh tasting and yummy.",

It could have easily fed two people, but if it is that good, why share? I love places like this. Simple restaurant specializing in something they do best, and this is the place to come for teriyaki. My food arrived at my patio table in less than 10 minutes. The salad had a delicious citrusy/sesame tasting dressing that mixed well with the rice and chicken. Chicken was so tender, and the teriyaki was neither too sweet or salty! Perfect taste. Since I like super spicy food, my only regret was not squirting Sriracha sauce all over it. However, I didn't realize that until AFTER I was half way done with my meal. It was so flavorful my spicy craving didn't even kick in I was way too full to continue on.   Good for lunch or early dinner since this place closes early. Drive-up window if you are in a rush!",

Though a nice size snack for me, but I find the bowl very unsatisfying.

I'm not too sure if this place deserves the famous red-sticker!  Maybe I'm spoiled, because I live in San Francisco/Bay Area and get better rice bowls from places like Kaz Teriyaki and Suruki Supermarket (both located in Downtown San Mateo). This is probably one of the better places Phoenix has to offer.",

Most of all, it looks welcoming.    Food: It's very good, but most of all, it's excellent bang for the buck! The teriyaki is not too sweet and it is well seasoned. I ordered the chicken fried rice with Iced tea. It was great. The iced tea comes with unlimited refills which the owner often reminds the customers while I was there.  Service: Although it is a \"self-service\" restaurant, the owner and staff was extremely helpful to a fault. She refilled my iced tea a couple of times.  I will return for sure. The owner did take her time to talk to most if not all her customers. If you are looking for a friendly place with good food, this would be it! It definitely does not hurt that the food is very affordable.",

This place is perhaps okay for the lunch crowd or related, but I do not think that it would be something worth trekking all the way to Central Phoenix for from where I live (Mesa AZ).  I can find comparable out in the East Valley.",

However for me, I will be \"waving bye\" as I frequently drive past Blue Fin.  The menu has some of my favorite common Japanese dishes (Teriyaki Chicken, Tonkatsu, etc.). I decided to roll with the White Chicken Katsu (Panko Breaded Chicken) and some Shrimp Tempura - relatively common, easy to make, usually tasty Japanese dishes. Well, I did not know they would use Arizona sand as the breading. The chicken was so over cooked and bland that it dried my mouth. Luckily there was enough grease to squeeze into my mouth from the Shrimp Tempura to combat the dryness.   The saving grace for Blue Fin are the portions and price point. One can chow down for a small price, but you will be sacrificing quality. Be sure to ask for extra water if ordering anything breaded!",

I was thrilled to not have to pay for parking, as they have a small area on the south end for parallel parking. Everything was incredibly clean and cared-for.   When I saw Japanese curry on the menu, I almost cried from happiness. With a small fountain drink, my total was under $8. Although it's not the best Japanese curry I've ever had, it was still delicious. I found the curry flavor itself to be a little...watered down. Japanese curry is more mild and savory than other curry styles, so a slightly higher concentration of the curry in the sauce would have knocked my lunch out of the park.  I didn't know this until after the fact, but you can request heat levels here, and they also have shakers on the table to customize the degree of spiciness.",

I got the coconut shrimp plate which has the shrimp, salad, and white rice.  Add a massively large drink (with free refills) and the total was just over $10.  More than filling.  If you don't want the drink and get a smaller rice bowl instead of a plate then you can probably grab a fresh lunch for under $7.  Everything just kind of works together.  I saw the salad on top of warm rice and my mind wasn't too excited, but there is something about the way they make it where it just mixes together well.  The dressing really makes it all come together.  The shrimp is hot, fresh, and isn't overly greasy; no oil splotches on the plate.  The dipping sauce is, like the dressing, a really good compliment to the shrimp.  Everything on the plate was good and a nice change of pace.  Really friendly workers, nice mix of guests, very convenient parking.  It looks small but it can handle a lot of people and there is even a drive-thru window.  One minor negative, and this is kind of strange, but it's the fork size.  It's a small plastic fork and you can't really get rice and lettuce on it.  I asked for a spoon after a few minutes of trying to balance everything.",

This casual  cafe is run by a Chinese family from Southern California. When we arrived for lunch, the place was packed with a lot of business workers looking for a cheap and quick lunch. Many people also ordered take out. The workers were fast and efficient. This place mainly serves teriyaki rice bowls and rice plates. The rice bowls were so delicious that we had to come back again later to order take out for our dinner. We highly recommend this place for you to try.",

It's probably not a good idea to order a hot yakisoba bowl  on a hot day and eat it on the patio. I try to always eat with chopsticks and i just kept getting hot  sauce on my face.  Oh only complaint is their tofu. It's just diced and sauteed. i would like it if maybe they marinated, baked and then sauteed. Panko fish is delicious!",

    "text": "I had very high expectations for this place after all the Yelp praise, expectations Blue Fin mostly lived up to. The place itself is nothing special, although they do have a big patio for when the weather is cooler. However, the food is very good and super cheap. Their daily special is quite the bargain - $6.75 gets you chicken teriyaki (all white meat, if you prefer, at no extra cost) over white rice with a side salad and two mini spring rolls. The spring rolls were very good, although a little greasy. The salad was good, although a little warm. The chicken teriyaki was great, but not your traditional teriyaki. Unlike most places, it seems like they cook the chicken in the sauce so that it's coated with the teriyaki flavor, rather tossing the chicken with the sauce or pouring sauce on top before serving it. That makes it a little more dry than I'm used to, but it also gives it a nice smokiness. Their sauce is a little less sweet than my Americanized Japanese palate is used to (Yoshi's, for instance, has a much sweeter sauce), but it's definitely more authentic. The best part of this place is the service - the people here are incredibly friendly, welcoming, and helpful.",

    "text": "I've actually dined in with the Blue Fin crew a number of times in the past.  Though tonight was the first time in awhile.  I remember generally liking the food at Blue Fin, but that it just wasn't memorable.  Admittedly I've dined at Asian fast food spots a bunch in my life so I guess after awhile some of them sort of blend together in my mind and on my palette.  I was actually on my way to the grocery store on this Friday evening.  But with traffic snarled thanks to rain (the thing that turns Phoenix drivers into horror movie co-conspirators), I pulled off and decided to grab a quick meal at Blue Fin.  Blue Fin is easy to spot on Central Avenue (just north of the main public library on Culver Street, two blocks south of McDowell).  A small relatively nondescript building with a small number of outside seats surrounded by nothing but asphalt for a whole block.  It quite literally sticks out.  The inside is equally free of fanciness with seating for maybe 20 and the menus are taped to different points all over the restaurant.  I was actually looking for the entree menu, but I failed to look around the corner to see the entree menu taped to the back of the soda machine.  Coming for the first time?  Keep your eyes open for the menu items taped to the back wall and elsewhere.      So I instead went with an item I could find on the menu in front of me.  I went with the White Chicken Panko plate.  White chicken fried in Japanese bread crumbs, with white rice and a salad and a side of tonkatsu sauce (basically a Japanese version of BBQ sauce).  Total cost for the plate including drink and tax came to about $9.  Came out in about 5 minutes.  The plate portion will definitely fill you up as there was plenty of meat and sides to satisfy pretty much any appetite.  The chicken itself was pretty solid and I liked the slightly sweet notes of the tonkatsu sauce.  The white rice was, well, white rice.  Though for me the big downer of this dish was the salad.  I'm not sure what type of dressing they put on, but they put on a ton (too much I thought).  The onion notes on the dressing were far too overpowering for me and ruined the texture of the lettuce for my taste.  I tried pairing the salad with the rice and chicken to make it more palatable, but no luck.  I've had other dishes here before without salad such as the teriyaki bowl and the sweet and sour chicken bowl and they're perfectly respectable.  Even after tonight though I have to say the food reminds me a great deal of other Japanese fast food standouts of yore such as Yoshi's and Shogun Express.  If you love that sort of food, Blue Fin will be right up your alley.  If I were in a lunch rush and needed some quick takeout, I'd certainly consider Blue Fin for that purpose.  But as a sit down option I'd take a friend or for a dinner stop, Blue Fin wouldn't be among my top choices.    But hey, judge for yourself.  The staff here is friendly, the prices are cheap and the food comes out quick.  Maybe you'll love this place moreso than I have, maybe you won't.  Might want to tell them to hold the salad dressing just to be on the safe side.",

When I was there, a fireman came in and, while he was waiting for his food, shared with the owner about a fire truck that visits once a year for an annual event, and for lunch, with their choice of anywhere in the valley, they chose to come here, to Blue Fin.  THE SERVICE The best part of my visit here was the service. Even if the food was only mediocre (again, it was delicious), I would go again just for the great service. The place is family owned. The staff was kind and patient. When I was seated, they came to check-in multiple times, offering extra sauces, a cover to keep my plate warm while I enjoyed my appetizers, extra cups of ice and water, and more. Mind you, this isn't a table service restaurant. This isn't a waiter earning a tip. This was grandma caring about the folks who chose to come to eat at her place. While I was here, I also observed a to-go order. They went through the receipt item by item with the customer, making sure that the customer knew what was what, and confirming that everything was right and present. So simple, but how many times have we all gotten wrong to-go orders elsewhere? All it takes is a little time and concern.  THE VERDICT I will be back. I do recommend. This is a gem of a place.

Her daughter Lynne was working as well and she was just as kind and hospitable as her mother. I didn't feel like I was at a restaurant, I felt as if I were at their home.

The sunomono (cucumber salad) teriyaki chicken, panko chicken, and tempura shrimp are all worth trying as you won't be disappointed.  The best part is the prices are affordable!",

Aside from that the service is fantastic even during a rush the wait is minimal! Honestly the staff here is some of the nicest people you'll ever meet!",

    "text": "This spot was always a regular drop for me when I was spent time studying for the GRE at the library. From what I've heard, this place has been around for quite a while which is a testament to the food they serve. It's important to know that this place isn't authentic Japanese, it's American Japanese, so prepare your taste buds accordingly. So far, this is the only place that I've found in Phoenix that serves Japanese curry. This isn't like hot sauce over a dish, this is the real deal.  As far as the food goes, it definitely hits the spot and is always sure to please. My usual tends to be the chicken curry. They really know how to pack in the flavor and make a portion that's not too big and not too small. My only complaint is that they tend to go a bit over on the onions. Another thing to pick up while you're there is their Japanese soda. I forget the name of it, but it comes in a glass bottle and it has a glass ball that rolls around inside. It's refreshing and fun to drink as well. The sushi here is kinda \"eh\", but it fills you up and chances are that if you're eating there you're not looking for top quality sushi.  My impression of the place is that it's family owned by the women that work there. The older one is really friendly and makes sure that you're enjoying your meal after she serves it to you. You can tell that they really appreciate your patronage and want you to come back. It's always a good thing to know that the owners of a restaurant are passionate and take pride in what they do and treat it as more than just a job.  It's been a while since I've been here, but I really need to swing by again. Some people would probably just brush this place off as some small food hut on a street corner. That would be a huge mistake. This place is like the Yoda of Phoenician restaurants in that it reminds you that, \"Size matters not.\"",

When delivered correctly, as Blue Fin does it, you realize that too many places are overdoing it by investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in appearances. This place is a good model for any restaurant owner/manager who is struggling with getting their troops to provide more than sub-par service...  Oh, and I almost forgot about the food. Priced right, tasted fresh, and worth a return trip.",

The service was quick and nice but I wouldn't recommend dining there as it seems to be heavy traffic for drunks and homeless people (unless people watching of sadness is your thing)so you would be best to pick up instead.  I doubt I go back since the place is only so so at best for two of my favorite things. The crab puffs were nice though.",

There are so many menu options here besides the tried and True teriyaki chicken! I'd recommend giving this place another try if you did not find the teriyaki to your liking (i personally don''t care for as much sauce on mine).  The panko fish dish could hold its own with the fish at any fish n chips or fried fish joint in town - beautifully textured and fried crispy outside, tender and moist inside.  Served on a bed of rice which to me is the perfect accompaniment to fried food in lieu of frenchfries.  All of the menu items are pictured on the wall to aid in your decision making.  Friendly affordable unpretentious Asian fast food, nothing more nothing less.  Located right across the street from the Central/McDowell Road light rail stop.  Would be the ideal place to get a bite to eat or a takeout order to go on your way to the ballpark for a weeknight game, or before hitting the streets for a First Friday artwalk.  Open till 6:30 pm Monday-Friday.",

    "text": "I was in the mood for chicken teriyaki so the BFF & I decided to give Blue Fin a try today before the Suns game. From the looks of it, one would expect a dingy little hole in the wall, but it's actually very clean inside. I secretly did a happy dance when I saw shakers of Japanese chili powder and black sesame seeds on each table.. two of my favorite condiments!   As we approached the counter, we were greeted by a cheerful and helpful lady, whom I later deduced is the owner's daughter. My friend asked which dishes were the most popular and she said, \"chicken teriyaki, panko chicken, pork katsu and chicken curry.\" I ordered the (dark meat) chicken teriyaki combo (comes w/ rice & salad) since that was my craving at the time and the BFF ordered 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef teriyaki combo (it's not on the menu, but the lady was nice enough to accomodate the request).   Our heaping plates arrived a few minutes later and we hungrily dug in. After the first bite, I realized I was kind of disappointed by the chicken teriyaki because the meat was very dry and it was heavily marinated in sauce. I think they gave me white meat, but we were short on time and the lady was busy serving others so I didn't bother asking. The BFF enjoyed his beef & chicken combo which doesn't surprise me since he's very easy to please when it comes to food.    I ate a few more bites so I wouldn't starve during the game and packed up the rest for the BFF to take home. Oh yeah, the salad was OK. Nothing special about it, but I should have figured it wouldn't be since it was only an additional $.80 from a regular teriyaki bowl.   The lady working was not only very nice & helpful when we ordered, but she also went above and beyond what one would expect from a fast food type place. She asked us once or twice if we're doing OK, asked if we needed more rice and as we were about to toss our plates, she offered to do it for us. I also noticed she was just as friendly to the other patrons.. even offered a guy a sample of the chicken teriyaki because he didn't know what to order.   I'd really rate the food at 3 stars, but added an extra for the super nice lady. I'd give something else a try the next time I'm in the area just because she was *that* nice.",

This place tops the charts in the speed category, you won't wait longer than 5 minutes for your order and they have a drive through....if you're in a hurry, it's a win-win situation.  Lastly, they package their \"to go\" orders in the typical plastic t-shirt bags that every other place uses HOWEVER, Blue Fin bags sport the nifty little 70's smiley face icon (which I am a big fan of)  along with the slogan \"Have A Nice Day!\"  Try Blue Fin!",

Wanted a light lunch, so ordered a veggie rice bowl. Veggies ended up having all the life cooked out of them(as if boiled for 30 mins), and the non-descript sauce just made this dish an unappetizing mush of heavily overcooked, flavorless veggies and soupy rice. Absolutely awful. I took the rice bowl back to the counter and told that it really was pretty bad, and they sweetly offered me another menu item of my choice even if the price was higher-  so I'll definitely give the counter ladies kudos for customer service. I chose to have the teriyaki chicken bowl as a replacement. The teriyaki bowl was brought out to me shortly after, but unfortunately after taking the first bite, I found that the chicken tasted like straight charcoal. Not like teriyaki, not like chicken, but straight acrid charcoal. I haven't tried any of their other dishes and they may be absolutely delicious, but after two strikes on two simple dishes in one visit, I can't see myself wasting time by visiting again.",

A asked if I could pick up my correct order with is just plain rice with vegetables and sauce, probably costs $0.50 to them to make. Instead of being told \"sure no problem \", I was told I need to be put on hold so the very young girl that couldn't have been more then 10 they had working could ask the manager.  Also there was not one but two children behind the counter operating the register and taking orders. All I wanted was the rite food. I said CURRY!!!!!  What I got was plain noodles and veggies. Hardly worth the money. I tried to make the best of it and eat it, but it was terrible.  All they gave me was ONE package told soy sauce.  It's not even the rite sauce for this \"food\". And it didn't help.",

The inside was very retro, and not very appealing.  They used styrofoam boxes and stuff even if you dined in, which was odd and not very environmentally friendly.  The place was a little dirty, bits and pieces of food could be found at all the vacant tables.  The service was also slow, their wasn't many people when I ordered, so I do not know what's the hold up.  The lady in the front was super friendly and helped me decide what I wanted since it was my first time.  I ordered this bowl of noodles with a bunch of veggies.  Kinda like lo-mein.    Overall a good place, the food is good as well.  This place would be great for taking out in my opinion.",

The value here is great, I got a super filling meal with a nice mix of protein and salad on my plate for less than $10, including even the veggie spring rolls that I added on. The family that runs this place was so nice as well. I'll definitely be back to try out the beef and the fish that everybody talks about.",

I ordered the panko fish plate, which comes with two pieces of fried, breaded fish served over rice with sauce on the side. The fish was a little dry, but the sauce helped with that. They definitely give a lot of rice, which was enough for me to take home for another meal. Overall, I'd say that the food wasn't my favourite, but I really enjoyed the friendly atmosphere.",

On this visit I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken.  It was nothing special.

In an area full of lunch only, counter order spaces, one would think this wouldn't be welcome. I love a rice bowl every now and then and this one is extremely high quality and stocks every type of rice bowl imaginable. I've had the Oyako and Teriyaki both multiple times and they are delcious. You definitely wait a few minutes for your food, and that is a good thing because it means they are not mass producing food and waiting for people to order it, like Tokyo Express does.   Good food alone though, won't garner a five-star review for a rice bowl. What pushes Blue Fin over the top is the ownership. The little old Japanese lady who owns and runs the restaurant during lunch time is one of the absolute nicest people I've ever encountered. She welcomes every customer, and speaks to you in a genuine family like manner. She does not come across as fake or ass-kissish. I just get a calm, warm, and welcome feeling from this woman when I come in here.  It's not even just her either. Her staff always looks happy, and has run of the soda fountain, water, lemonade, etc. Everyone just seems to be happy. It's True that if you take care of your staff, they make your customers happy as well.  Many other places make me feel so unwelcome around here at lunch time, but I can always count on Blue Fin to treat me like family and give me a solid rice bowl.",

Much like Grocery Store packaged sushi.  The edamame was the worst I have ever had. It was obviously just 'nuked' and some of the beans had white areas on them from frost burn in their freezer. Really, avoid these!  The teriyaki chicken bowls, which we were expecting based on the reviews here to be delicious, were only . . . \"so so\" at best. The meat was chewy, there was some gristle thrown in for good measure, and in general, it was a big disappointment. I went in on a Groupon type special and felt that we got our money's worth, but just barely.  On the positive side, the serving size was nice on the bowl, and the women serving/making the food were very sweet and friendly. I hope their business does well, but I assure Yelpers that it will require them to upgrade their quality or this place won't be there long.",

But then I saw the awesome looking teriyaki bowls on the wall and I grew much more optimistic. I should have been let down...but I most certainly wasn't.   The price was fantastic, and the portion size was fantastic. Not only that...but it tasted really really goooooood! I wish I could have had the time to go back to try more stuff as the beef teriyaki that I got was fantastic.",

    "text": "Maybe I went there on an off-day, or because I got there right before closing, my chicken teriyaki to-go was dry as a bone. The rice underneath was moist and I appreciate the huge helping of salad, but the star of the meal was not up to par.   ... I went back this week and I have to upgrade my review. I went during lunchtime (around 1pm) and got the chicken teriyaki bowl with salad again. A coworker had been telling me to give it another try because he's always had good meals there. This time the chicken was fresh and moist, very tender and delicious. Even though I'm petite and the portion was gigantic, I managed to finish all except 3 pieces. All of my coworkers were impressed.   My coworker got the yellow curry bowl, once with chicken and a second tme with beef. He really likes it, and I took a look and saw it's made similar to the way my parents make it, which means it might become a comfort food for me.  I also met the owner Betsy and her daughter while I was picking up the order. They were really nice, friendly people. That had nothing to do with my change in review, I should add.",

    "text": "I really wanted Asian food for lunch and to get out of the office on foot. Lucky for me, The Blue Fin met both requirements. (Sorry, I do not consider Pei Wei Asian food) I had heard about this place and always wondered about the dinky place with the blue awning.   First off, I was impressed for a mom-and-pop place with a drive-thru window, it was pretty immaculate. I noticed while sitting down to wait for my order, there wasn't a crumb on any empty table. The woman behind the counter was friendly and seemed to know a lot of the people coming through.   As for the food, I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted my chicken teriyaki vegetable bowl with brown rice. The chicken wasn't drenched in an overly sweet sauce like a lot of Japanese places. It had this smoky flavor like it had been on the grill, not something I'm used to with teriyaki. I certainly didn't mind it. Also, the cabbage, carrots, etc. had some flavor to them and they didn't taste like they had been overcooked or terribly greasy like at a Panda Express. I felt full afterward, but not in a gross \"I ate too many onion rings\" kind of way. The bowl cost about $6.50 which I consider reasonable. The place also has a watercooler where you are free to fill 'er up. When the cashier wasn't busy, she came around and grabbed my cup to refill it for me. Nice touch.   Now, I gave it four stars not because I'd call it a four-star restaurant but for what it offers considering it's \"fast food\" and for the good manners. I'll definitely come again. I could see meeting someone there for lunch or hogging a table just to read a book in between noshing on teriyaki.",

It just so happened that I was split between two offices today and Blue Fin was in the middle. So, I exited off McDowell and was treated to the amazing aromas of BF.   Upon entering, I'm greeted by the nicest lady I might have ever met. She admires my plaid jacket. (BTW, there's a Yelp sticker on the door!) After reviewing the menu--which has a good selection of choices--I decide on the panko fish over white rice. That wonderfully kind lady was sad to see me leave because she wouldn't get to see if I liked my food. Waiting at the LR station, I was glad I picked up an extra pair of chop sticks because some crazy-eyed man was looking at my bag. Although it had been about 10 minutes from the time I received my food to the time I walked back into my office, the food hadn't really cooled down all that much. Nice! The fish was super crispy on the outside yet marvelously moist inside. And the rice was good too.   I'll definitely be back, kind lady. And hopefully I'll be able to eat there with you so you know how much I appreciate great food and expectational service.",

So, don't be surprised if you show up and order one of these dishes and they tell you that they're sold out. Which goes to show how fresh their food really is!  Keep in mind that they're only open during the week and until about 6:30pm  And since the light rail was finished downtown, getting to Blue Fin is a little tricky, but it's worth the trip!",

I ordered the white meat Teriyaki Chicken bowl with brown rice, along with a pork egg roll and a large drink.  The meal arrived at my table quickly.  Upon first bite, I was taken aback because the teriyaki sauces I've tried are really, really sweet.  This sauce is not as sweet, but much more flavorful.  The egg roll was good, but the sweet/sour sauce it came with was better than I've ever had.  Simple, sweet, and not gooey or gloopy.    One of the owners (a wonderfully pleasant aging Japanese woman) came to my table and offered me chopsticks and hot mustard -- we had a delightful conversation wherein she explained that the chicken is hormone-free and char-grilled over pumice stones, and their sauces are home-made from family recipes.  They also offer many healthy options, including brown rice and vegetarian dishes, and NO MSG IS ADDED!!  She was a fantastic host.    Everyone seemed to be hurrying around, but they were all doing a great job keeping the customers happy by refilling drinks, delivering orders and making conversation with the people inside and outside the shop.  All in all, a great experience.  I told the owner I would be back with my son by the end of the week, and I plan to keep my promise!  Great job, Blue Fin!",

Her helpful tips made it extremely easy for me to order! Otherwise I get easily (and admittedly) overwhelmed and would've missed my train while trying to decide what to order.   3. The food was simple, yet good. Affordable as well.  It's the perfect \"train food\" as far as I'm concerned. Healthy, easy to travel with and very conveniently located right next to the platform.

I was on the phone in the lot for a bit and went in at 645. I didn't even realize they close at 630 but the staff person was still serving customers and pleasant as always. The Panko Chicken is my favorite but I have had many other things also. The Panko was freshly made and my order very quickly filled.  I recommend this place to anyone hungry for fresh Asian fare!",

    "text": "A few weeks ago, an old friend and I made plans to meet up for lunch. Problem is, I essentially live in North Scottsdale and she is in Buckeye. Using <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FMeetways.com&s=67be17fe6544647e2cb9dfb5cbf3e984cec606db583e58b1d2bfa8e24be76733\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Meetways.com</a> to find a halfway point, I then took the results to Yelp to see what restaurants are in the area (I prefer to find the good local places, rather than a chain, which I'm sure is True for most Yelpers). Anyways, saw the great reviews and decided to check this place out.  We both were unadventurous and ordered chicken teriyaki bowls which were of course delicious as others have said. Very nice portions too as neither of us downed the whole bowl. Where this place really shines, though is the service. An older woman, who I'm guessing must have been one of the owners as someone else mentioned, was walking around conversing with the patrons. It's a small place so she was able to check with everyone on multiple occasions during the time we were there.   Her service was absolutely delightful. When I received my food first (I had ordered a couple minutes before, so my friend had just finished ordering when I got my meal), she came over to the table and informed that the young lady would not think I was rude if I started eating before she was served. A moment later, she came back with my friend's food as she told us that she \"has pull around here\" lol. I'm guessing that teriyaki bowl was intended for another customer, so sorry about the added wait if that's the case, random stranger. A while later she came back to give us free refills of our large drinks.   I will definitely be going back when I'm in the area again, and might have to order something different. A wonderful experience that was truthfully what motivated me to actually sign up for Yelp and write a review after years of using the app as an \"outsider\"  The only negative was that the parking is very limited, but then again I did go during the lunch rush. My friend was able to get a spot in their lot but I wound up having to park in a different lot just north of it. It was maybe only 30 feet further away, I just wasn't sure if I would be towed or not.",

Quite frankly, this place impressed my socks right off. I had heard that it had some good items however I must say that is quite an understatement. Best Teriyaki in the city by far; their panko chicken is also to die for!  Bottom line: I live in south east Gilbert and have driven to eat here 3 times in the last month. Enough said.",

    "text": "I dig going to the Blue Fin for lunch to satisfy my occasional teriyaki fix. The service is friendly and prompt, and the location allows for some people watching, since it is across the street from a light rail station.  Last time I ate here I upgraded from the teriyaki chicken and vegetable bowl to the platter. This means that it comes with salad, which is fairly simple shredded iceberg lettuce and house dressing. Unfortunately, when it's \"to go\", everything gets packed in the same styrofoam container, so the lettuce gets warmed up on top of the entree and isn't all that palatable. I've said it before in other reviews, warm salad = bad, chilled salad = good. Despite my salad woes, I really like the food here and have never failed to enjoy what I've ordered. And since it's always been reasonably priced, the Blue Fin is a cool little Japanese lunch spot where you can get your Teriyaki on!",

However - after a friend of mine told me that I was crazy and that the food was delicious, I had to try it.  Now I've eaten there three times this week.    I should also probably mention that I usually hate all things teriyaki - it's disgustingly over sweet and I can't understand why people like it.  BUT this place has it right - it's fresh, not out of a jar, and made by the sweetest people you'll ever talk to.  Try a chicken bowl with extra veggies and brown rice - you won't be disappointed.  And don't forget to order an eggroll - they're amazing and they come with this ridiculous ginger sauce that'll leave you craving more.",

When ordering at Blue Fin keep in mind that when chicken cooks at high temperatures, dark meat retains moisture better and is more flavorful than breast meat. I highly recommend ordering the dark meat with their main dish. Many of the reviews below that complain about dryness or about shaved meat is commenting on the white meat teriyaki, which apparently isn't their niche. Order with dark meat and I promise you'll be back again very soon.",

    "text": "Bossman has been whining ever since Shogun Express on Camelback closed a few years ago. Yogi's and Yoshi's and wherever else we tried never really cut it. A Yelp search brought up Blue Fin, and although it's a little further than normal to fetch lunch, I mentioned it to him and he agreed to try it. And glad we were!   We had the daily special ($7.29), which consisted of teriyaki chicken, rice, salad, 2 spring rolls and drink, and an order of sunomono ($1.29). Opt for all white meat (+$0.75) and brown rice (+$0.30). It was a lot of food. The salad was meh, and in the same box as the teriyaki, so it was kinda warm by the time I got back to the office (at least the dressing was in a separate container). Probably won't order the special again, just to avoid the salad. The rice was perfect, the sauce was delicious and the chicken was fantastic. Thinly sliced (not in chunks like all the other joints) and no yucky gristle or fat hanging off. If anything, maybe a little too heavy on the soy sauce. The spring rolls were just a tad under cooked, but still good. The sweet & sour sauce looked kinda grainy, but tasted just fine. Sunomono was great. Overall, the best teriyaki bowl in the area!  I picked up our food in the middle of lunch time and was expecting parking to be terrible, based on other reviews. But there were only a couple other cars in their small lot. There were 25-30 people scattered around the inside & outside tables, so I'm guessing they either foot it, or take the light rail, which stops just out front. Also, they have a drive up window. I'm not sure if you can order it there or if it's just for pickup, but it'd be convenient with a phone-in order next time! The staff was SUPER friendly, to boot!   P.S. They accept Visa & Mastercard, but not AmEx or Discover.",
