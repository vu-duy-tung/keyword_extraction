    "text": "*Lunch. Noon. Wednesday. Empty save a few people at the bar and patio. *Nice build-out. Industrial. Open and airy. Seating outside if you want sun and traffic (it's right on Scottsdale Rd). *Staff looks to have been bought on the cheap - shabby, frumpy compared to the Old Town Scottsdale run-of-the-mill pretty people. Service was friendly. *Burger, fries, beer on draft. Burger ordered medium rare. Food came out 10-12 minutes after ordered.. Burger was medium-medium well. Sent back for medium rare, as ordered. Ranch watered down and tasted like tzatziki sauce. I had to ask if it was indeed ranch, and indeed it was. Beer was cool, not cold, and had to be sent back. Beer came back almost cold, 5 minutes later.  **Summary (and tips for the management): For a restaurant competing in Old Town Scottsdale, you better bring your A-game 100% of the time - ESPECIALLY so since you just opened your doors, and are charging $12 for a cheeseburger. In the age of Yelp you'd better come correct. I'm hoping that my experience was a witness to growing pains/learning curve and am currently undecided if I'll give it another shot.",

Service consistently outstanding. Does have a Chicago feel to the food, lots of great options. I'm no expert but seems like business isn't flowing like it should. My guess is the price point for a brewery. I might throw in a couple of specials.",

    "text": "First time here on a thursday after work for a happy hour and dinner with a friend. The location is awesome but the parking is not no where to be seen! Have to park around the corner or valet. Not a fan of that as its old town and its hard enough to find parking.  When you walk in the architect of the building is awesome. I love the high ceilings and the style they have placed with steal beams and the wood work. It looks almost like what a club should look like with the levels of seating. Had a drink at the bar while I waited and bartenders were good, friendly. I like how they made the experience intentional by getting my name and referring to me by it the whole time. It goes a long way to make you feel welcomed.  As I sat i realized this place was huge, but with no one inside made it feel too big.  Sat out on the patio for dinner, great food! Had the burger and it was just as good as any other one on the blvd. I liked the patio area but can use a little upgrade as it a big plain to look at. Needs more curb appeal! And they need to do something to get more people in the doors for the overall experiance.   For the Beer... as it is s brewery! Really happy with the taste of the IPA's. I am a big IPA fan and the Wabble was great! Highly recommend it and the other IPA they have. They carry their own selection of beer but also have bottles and cans of locals I think I saw.   Will be going back to see what else they offer. Bartender said the breakfast was good so that might need to be the next adventure for this location.",

    "text": "So this place is brand new! Hence the \"hot and new\" tag from Yelp. However, I didn't know it literally opened a week before I decided to have my birthday celebration there. I was just looking for a brewery close by my home that I had never been to and Yelp led me to their front door.   When I called to make a reservation, they were very nice and accommodating. I ended up reserving the \"private\" room they have near the back of the restaurant. I say \"private\" in quotations because it's a room with glass walls.   I didn't order much food because I had eaten prior but I stole a few bites of my boyfriends pretzel with beer cheese and YUM! You can never go wrong with a soft pretzel and beer cheese. As for beers, I'm a huge fan of their hefeweizen. It was really really tasty and right up my alley.   I'm excited to head back to try more of their food and experience the brewery!",

Old town is known for great restaurants and food. Recently microbreweries and tap houses are opening which in my opinion is long overdue.    They have a great location and the patio is awesome for relaxing and people watching. Decent beers, which alone would yield 3 to 4 starts.   Unfortunately this is where the positives end. The food and service are horrible at best. The ribs maybe the absolute worst I have eaten in my life.  The Cuban was just as bad and awful excuse of a sandwich. The remaining items ordered where absolutely unmemorable.   I honestly cannot condemn the food enough to do it justice. We have far too many options for good to great food in old town for this place to survive.  They need to seriously revamp the menu and learn how to make some decent food. I guarantee locals will not support inferior food no matter how good the beer or location.  If they do survive it will be due to the seasonal tourist and winter snowbirds not the locals.",

Im pleasantly surprised with the quality of the management evolution since the beginning and feel the vibe of the restaurant becoming more cohesive and welcoming. I most certainly recommend the mac & cheese (in an adult portion - for sure, bacon if you dare); and if you have to take kids for an excuse to eat it, i recommend borrowing one. When the Root Beer is on tap its another definite recommendation; oddly being at a brewery there are a million other things to try that are delicious; but the RB is by far one of the best ive ever had. I have to highly urge you sit on the patio should weather and sun permit, they have gone great lengths to make the seating comfortable and cool at all times, but never miss an opportunity to be outdoors and soak up the atmosphere; its a real treat...",

For an entree I had the grilled chicken sandwich which I didn't care for that much either, tasted a little burnt.   The atmosphere was nice however and I had a good time with my friends.

I was not overly impressed with the beer. 2 of our party were not beer drinkers, but they enjoyed their beer cocktails. I thought they tasted terrible.

The hostess seemed very under-trained, then our server was late greeting us and blamed the hostess. She never brought our waters, food arrival was out of order and sub-par (chips on the nachos were so stale they were unchewable).....and my hubby's Bloody Mary took foreeeeever and was watery. We brought friends here from out of town, and was very, very let down!!! Won't be returning!",

We didn't plan like we should have so our reservation was super last minute and our number was way off (21 turned into more like 30) BUT the staff here was able to not only accommodate our large party but they also put up with every little request we had. Granted, one of our waitress looked like she was going to kill us, ALL Night, she still rolled with everything we were throwing at her. The food was amazing and the drinks just kept on coming. We weren't the easiest crowd but this wedding reception was a huge hit and it couldn't have happened without Two Brothers. Thank you all so much!!!",

Service was good, vibe was good, even had a cool fireplace, but even the guacamole was bad. If you can't make good guacamole I don't know what you're doing in that kitchen. Nothing had salt NOT EVEN the French fries. I have had better french fries at McDonalds. Don't even get me started on the cheese curds. I seriously can not even get them out of my mind. The cheese was not melted and tasted funky. Once again one of the worst meals I have ever had.",

I came here with my son (he's 9) and they had a decent selection on the kids menu but he opted for the adults.  Our server was Rachel and she was great, and so was the girl following her  We ordered for appetizers a Greek salad and calamari.  My son loved the calamari, it was just standard to me, nothing to fancy.  And then I got a  Greek salad and it was probably my favorite thing I ate there.  They actually grill the cherry tomatoes and it makes such a difference!  For entrees we had a small pizza and the turkey chimi, as a recommendation from our server.  The turkey chimi was delicious! The pizza was kind of boring.    Overall it was a nice experience, next time I'm in town I'll probably sit on the patio with my pup!",

I usually get the Ebel Weiss, and it's honestly one of the best hef's I've had.   As far as food we usually split the nachos. It's HUGE & yummy & has BOTH melted cheese and cheese sauce (as well as a spicy green sauce that's just delicious). This is usually enough for the two of us (it's pretty gargantuan), but I have tried other things that I remember being really good (I think a couple of the pizzas & salads). Also, both kinds of fries they serve are yummy.   This is really good space in Old Town (It used to be that bar w/the mechanical bull). There's two levels w/tables & a large open bar. There's also fire pits on the patio for when it's cold outside. I can't remember ever having bad service here.",

Not to say that going half way is bad, but it has to be done correctly. Kinda like walking a tightrope, not a lot of room for error or improvisation. When it's done right it can reap its own rewards, but Two Brothers just doesn't pull it off.  it's a pretty safe choice if you are going out to eat. It has the traditional foods like hamburgers and such, and a pretty wide selection of drinks. But I always get the feeling the place is trying to balance the scales between appealing to a wide audience that just eats hamburgers, and that group of people who need a hard I.P.A.  I've been here quite often, and the staff is nice 100% of the time. However, sometimes they seem to drift off into what seems like the great beyond, and you're stuck wondering where you are. Your best bet if you're on a  schedule is ask for the check right after you order. Also, they've kinda dropped the metaphorical ball on the food at times. Gotten a grill cheese a few times that wasn't fully grilled, and you can't eat a cold cheese sandwich. It just ain't kosher.  But if you're in Scottsdale, hit it up. There is a 85% chance you're going to enjoy your meal. 95% if your'e not in a rush.",

The only thing I could taste was thick breading and tortilla. It was a task trying to swallow each bite. Not to mention there wasn't an ounce of flavor, and same with my boyfriends bacon wrapped meatloaf. I had a bite of his peas because I was still hungry after eating only one taco, and the peas were crunchy and had so much pepper it was insane. Seriously, how do you fail at peas??? I've never bashed a restaurant before, but I feel too tricked and genuinely pissed to hold back. Oh, and be sure to ask exactly what accompanies the dish because I got a pound and a half of pico on each taco (I HATE raw tomatoes and onions) but it doesnt inform you in the description on the menu.  Two stars for the optical illusion the building creates.",

I suppose I was hoping I'd encounter some consistency, but my most recent visit has soured me on the establishment as a whole.   Last Saturday I sat at the bar, ordered a $5 beer. After waiting over 15 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge me or my empty glass, I decided ordering another was more trouble than it was worth, and set my credit card on my glass to indicate my intent to close my tab should the bartender bother to attend her bar. Eventually another employee walked by, took my card, and delivered my bill. I was charged $75.56.   I spoke with the employee who charged my card and explained the situation. He told me he was the manager, reversed the charge, and kindly comped my singular $5 beer. I asked for a receipt of the reversal, he said he couldn't give me one, but that the pending authorization would be released the following morning, Sunday, and provided his name.   So now it's Wednesday and the charge is still pending in my bank account. I called Two Brothers yesterday, spoke to a different manager who said he'd call me back after investigating, conceding that the charge should have disappeared by that time. He never did call me back, still have a pending charge for $75.56.",

I'll keep this short and sweet...  *Good beer selection - some brewed on sight, others from their brewery in Chicago. Good amount of IPAs which are my favorite. I ordered an Outlaw - it was alright but I prefer something more bitter. *Had the Waffle BLT - it's one of their award winning sandwiches. Two types of cheeses, bacon, arugula, and tomato pressed in a waffle press. When I order a BLT, I expect a good amount of bacon...this one had two pieces. It was more or less a cheese sandwich, add bacon. I expected it to be great since it had beat out some of the other dishes from area restaurants...apparently those must have been reeeaaaallllly bad. *Salt and pepper fries were good  *Potato salad was good but has cumin in it. I hate cumin. *Excellent coffee  Sandwiches and sides are a la carte - $11 for cheese sandwich add bacon and $3 for fries. Meh. Had I ordered something else my rating might be different. Unfortunately, chances are I won't return since I don't find myself in Scottsdale often, and there are many other places I want to try in Old Town. If I do return, it will be for a coffee or a beer at the bar.",

The Domaine Dupage is a beer full of wonderful flavors that will take you on journey as if visiting Willy Wonka's factory.   We split the Tap House burger which hit every spectrum of tastiness to spiciness in every bite. I've been to this place number our times and I have never had a bad time  I don't think I saw Josh pull out a note pad the entire time. He's got a memory like an elephant and the jokes of a hyena. The fact that he could keep up with us on every level is enough to say he is a damn good server.",

My friend and I both had the pesto chicken sandwich,  which was good.  The chicken was tender and the pesto was flavorful.  Our boyfriend's both had burgers,  which they ordered medium rare but that came out medium well.  Even overcooked,  they both said they were still tasty. The service was a little lacking, it took at least 10 minutes before anyone even greeted us, and we weren't checked on much after the food came out.  We all would have ordered another beer,  but by the time we had the chance,  we were done eating. I'll be back,  if only for the delicious beer!",

The bar area is pretty large and has just enough TVs so that you can watch a game without being overwhelming.  Since they have been in the Chicago area for quite a while they have a broad selection of their own well-made beers already to go here in Scottsdale.  They hope to be brewing on the second level of the Scottsdale location very soon.  I liked their Wobble IPA and their Domaine Dupage ale quite a bit.  I also tried their mac and cheese with bacon which was great.  I wasn't wild about their salmon dip as it seemed more like something you'd smear on a bagel than dip pita or celery into due to it's firm texture.  All in all, it was a fun visit.  I'll be sure to come back soon!",

These two brothers know how to brew a beer!  The location is great, located near Old Town, and the bar/restaurant itself was modern, clean, and vibrant. They had a really nice patio with fire pits, that I could see packing up after dark.   I only had a couple of appetizers, but the food was fast, fresh, and good.   The beer though...come here for the beer!  They have their own IPA, German Style, American Ale, Amber, and many more. They even have a rotating season selection of their craft beers...served in a chilled glass. Wonderful.   Go sample the beers (they will let you!) and hang out at this fun, beer-centric spot near Old Town.",

You know two Brothers has been in business long enough and in the restaurant industry long enough that they should know how to make a chicken sandwich. They also should know when they have an awful chicken sandwich. It was one of the worst if not the worst chicken sandwich I have ever had. I probably would've stuck around and had another beer but the food was so bad that we moved on. I can go to any fast food restaurant and get a significantly better chicken sandwich and french fries. I didn't say anything to the manager because I didn't want my money back I wanted beer and something good to eat. The service and atmosphere deserved a 4-5 stars. If I return it'll only be for beer no food.",

I had the Sriracha honey chicken & biscuits which were good; a nice blend of spicy/sweet/savory but the sauce kind of soaked through the biscuits making them fall apart. I'd definitely be back for the beer! We loved the Ebel's Weiss! It takes me back to my days of living in Germany.",

We love RW & liked the idea of getting beer tastings with each course, so that is why we chose Two Brothers. Like the previous reviewer indicated the courses were disjointed & they were subbing ingredients, so the dishes weren't as described on the menu. My skirt steak was so tough / chewy it felt like the cook had never prepared that cut of meat before.   Additionally, even though the place wasn't busy & there appeared to be plenty of servers, our server was hard to locate & then seemed frazzled when she came to our table. I am disappointed because items on their regular menu sounded good, but we likely won't go back with so many other brew pubs in the valley that we enjoy consistently.",

You think they would give you water as courtesy before anything else, but not here.  I guess going to the back room or the front to talk to her coworkers were more important.

The nachos served with it were also ok, nothing special.  We then had the Cuban sandwich which was a bit of a disappointment. The bread was fair, and the sandwich was not made with love. The meats and cheese were something you would get at a grocery store, and it was put together with some pickles and run of the mill yellow mustard.   Not great, not terrible, but there are lots of other restaurants in the area with good food.",

I ordered a coffee like a White Russian with Chocolate, the first one was made by the bartender, it was really tasty and not to sweet. The second was made by the hostess, still not sure why, but it was way two sweet. When the bill came, they charged us for two coffees which were 8.00, two shots of vodka which was 14.00 and two shots of a similar liquor to Kaluha, 16.00. So each drink averaged to around 20.00. Considering that the second one was just bad, all that they were willing to do was remove a coffee. We also ate food so I was very surprised and disappointed that they didn't remove the second drink. Won't be the first place I recommend to anyone.",

I guess the waffle comes from the pattern left on the croissant from using a waffle iron as a panini press. It and the fries were pretty greasy. Didn't really taste the salt and pepper on the fries.

The pizza, pretzels, nachos, fries, veggie burger, hummus, coleslaw have all been delicious.  The beer is good two. I like wobble IPA.

    "text": "In town for work down the street and stumbled upon this awesomeness by walking by before the crazy dinner crowd. Very typical taphouse, micro brew decor with a trendy little twist with the glass walls and metal.   Even though it was early, staff was friendly and eager to help. Happy hour has half off all apps. They brew their own awesomeness, so if you havent been there before tell them and they can give you the run down.   Oh did i mention some home town props, this place is out of DuPage County Illinois, specifically Warrenville, right by where i grew up so it was awesome to see the Blackhawks flag flying since they just won the cup!!! They even have some omage in the beer names.  The menu was pretty diverse, with the usual burger and fry fare, along with some Arizona, green chili, smoky pepper treats to try. Give this place a try if you are in town and want to just hang out and relax.  Faves: cinnamon root beer, hummus, beer fries",

Wife wings were slightly better than average.  My Habanero wings were mediocre at best.  Very hot (which is my preference) but offered very little flavor.  In fairness, the Caesar Salad and Cole Slaw were sizable and tasty.  However, it took almost 30 minutes to get our food even though we sat down at the bar at just past 5:00pm.  Remarkably slow! .  If it weren't for the great service from our bartender (Mickey) this meal would have been a real disappointment.  We won't hurry back.....",

He said, \"four.\" I asked if any were a little citrusy. He said, \"not really.\" I said, \"OK give me a Wobble IPA.\" As I drank it I read their menu, which described their 20 year anniversary IPA as being brewed with Denali hop that features big juicy notes of pineapple, citrus and tropical fruit. Nice effort.",

Best thing was a fried chicken between biscuit (pictured). The falafel was awful. And the skirt steak was confusing. Dishes had disjoined ingredients and components that didn't work well together and was just like the service, slow and disconnected. In fairness it was probably because it was restaurant week and different service for them with pairings. Looking around the place there was also a coffee shop and they are trying marketing campaign with dogs and the beer and dining, etc. I feel like they suffer from shiny objects syndrome and they would be better off just doing a couple of those things really well.",

    "text": "With a prime location in Old Town, we thought we couldn't go wrong with this Illinois-based brewery. Although being able to sit out on the patio with temperatures pushing 70 was relaxing and allowed us to people watch, we weren't impressed with the beer or the food. We arrived on an early Sunday afternoon with the first of two NFL divisional playoff games coming to end. But looking inside, the open two level space was clean with a horseshoe bar on the lower level and large metal brewing tanks dominating the upper level.  There was about a ten minute greet after being sat and given menus and the seasonal beer list. We found it odd that our server had asked us if we were drinking beer and after we said yes, she said that she asks because she has a whole spiel about the brewery, then proceeded not to give it to us? I'm sure she would have informed us in addition to their brews, that they have a list of interesting beer cocktails, or that they roast their own coffee, or maybe that you can take a growler to go? We'll never know.  I ordered the Two Brother AZ Milk Stout which has IBU score of 12, which for some reason, I felt that score was way off, it should have been two to three times higher. It had a very dry, bitter finish for a stout which was too much for me and that's saying a lot. My brother had the Imperial Cane and Ebel which he thought was OK.  For food, we started off with some cheese curds and beef nachos. And for entrees, I had the Southwest Short rib Sandwich with other entrees including the Frizzle Dizzle Burger, Fish and Chips, Waffle BLT, and a Grilled Cheese. Not too get complicated in describing the food, but greasy and old would be good terms. All of the food looked like it had been sitting out a while and maybe the fryer oil needed changed. The fish and chips, cheese curds (which were over fried), and nachos were the only dishes that were finished and that I would consider ordering again. With only two beers ordered, our bill worked to $20/person which I thought was pretty high given the food quality.  With a strong history and following, I probably picked the wrong beer and should have ordered a flight. But if I were to come back, I would just stick to the beer and eat elsewhere. We started off on the wrong foot here and never really got on track.",

After my first and last visit today now I understand why.  I pass this place on a daily on my way to and from work and while the restaurants in the area can have a line out the door this brewery always seems to be begging for a piece of the action. Its a great location along Scottsdale road and in the middle of where everyone wants to be. At first glance the food menu while uneventful caters to a typical bar crowd. The beer selection is decent. The seating, layout and ambiance components are all there. The most important aspect however is where this place fails miserably. Bad service is and always will be the #1 reason a forgiving patron will never return. Having to wait an unreasonable time for another drink when the place is almost empty is really not cool. We ordered a MR burger, mayo on the side but instead had a burger slathered with mayo brought to us instead. After bringing this to the waitress's  attention she took it back, assured us it would be remade and after another 15 minute wait we were presented with what was obviously the same burger only this time it was so overcooked it was almost burnt and with an obvious mayo scrape off job. A major disrespect to a customer. I hope this place can spare a few burger patties without breaking the bank if another mistake like this should occur or I don't really see this place making it for too long.",

They had a very good variety of beers and the server (Alex) was knowledgeable, friendly, and spent time talking with us about beer. Our favorites were Ebel Weiss (Amazing), the dry stout, Domaine Dupage, and the milk stout.  The burgers (grass fed) and fries are delicious and the rest of the menu looks really good. They seem to take their food and beer seriously.",

The atmosphere is modern casual with a large open floor plan and upper balcony above the bar area. The food samplings were delicious I definitely will be back when I'm in the mood for a burger and a beer. However, I fear this place may not survive in the highly competitive restaurant and bar district of Old Town Scottsdale. I rarely see this place particularly busy.  However, that doesn't stop me from buying their Two Brothers beers and other restaurants in grocery stores in the valley. Maybe they will find a crowd during the football season.",

We sat on the patio with since it was a cool night.  They have craft beers of their own, but nothing really stood out to me as distinguishable that I can say -- wow!  I shot for the Outlaw; an India Pale Ale since I've been recently into IPAs.  Overall, I nice finish and bold taste with a slight hint of floral aroma.  For my food I went for the Oldtown Burger.  It came along with Chorizo, Pablano, Jack cheese, and onions on a Brioche bun.  The burger was cooked perfectly the way I wanted it; medium rare.  The chorizo and pablano really provided the heat while the onions made it a tad bit sweet.  Overall, a decent burger.  I don't really care for the Brioche bun for my burgers I guess.    In the end, I hope Two Brothers Tap House continues to strive.  I appreciate small breweries making it happen in the scene and giving the major beers a run for their money!  The place is super spacious and has many television screens for a great sports bar atmosphere. - Enjoy!",

Our waiter did an amazing job of getting our order and everyone else's orders in and our drinks to us in a timely fashion.   We started off with beer brezen and it was very tasty. The twenty-plus beer cheese sauce was so good I could have had a pint of it by itself. I also ordered the Wobble IPA which was decent.   We were wanting a light lunch so we both got salads. I got the Tap House with chicken which was extremely good. My wife got the Roundhouse chopped salad which was out of this world. The blackened chicken with the chile-lime vinaigrette paired so well with the greens and quinoa.   Judging by the appetizer and two salads we had as well as viewing what others around us ordered the food here is superb. I wasn't overly impressed with the beer but it's a great place to get some grub.",

The Wobble IPA was ok.    Why we more than likely won't return:    When we drove by, it looked closed because the patio was not set up and was a wreck, beer is just ok, the place was dirty and had a weird smell to it, the cushions in the booth were disgustingly dirty with stains all over them, the service was ok, but she really didn't show any personality, they still had bus tubs in the middle of the floor collecting water from a leaking ceiling from a storm a week earlier, at 6:30 PM on a Thursday, there were only (3) four tops and (6) people sitting at the bar.  I watched the floor manager guy with no hair hang out at the front host station and not approach a single one of the three tables in the place.  Ridiculous!  In summary:  My wife and I managed and bartended through college.  We have worked at several places including Fleming's Steakhouse.  The reasons we are not coming back which are stated above are things that the owners and the manager should have the common sense to address.  The lack of cleanliness is the main reason.  I couldn't see the kitchen and maybe I do not want to after seeing the dining area.  The three stars was for the food!",

We also joke that he eats a cheeseburger a day (ok, it's not really a joke, it's True), and this place fit that bill. We each ordered a different beer, and everyone loved the beer they chose. We started off with the Chimichurri nachos with beef. The portions were HUGE and I definitely spoiled my dinner on the nachos because they were so good that I couldn't stop eating them. Everyone but me ordered the Frizzle Dizzle burger, and they all enjoyed that. I had the muffaletta sandwich, which was really good but so large that I couldn't finish it. I also got it with a house salad, and it was much better than a standard house salad. It had feta cheese and green olives in it and was very fresh. Everyone else had fries, which they greatly enjoyed. My boyfriend's father is handicapped, and the place seemed very handicapped friendly, but we also went a bit early so it wasn't too crowded. The staff was nice and we were served quickly. If I lived there I'd definitely go back!",

The beergarita was too sweet with little tequila or beer taste.  The $5 soup, while tasty, was served in a thimble!  The grilled cheese panini, again tasty, was the size of a card deck!  So, if small, tasty, and overpriced are your thing; this place may be for you!",

The beer was tasty, the atmosphere was fun and welcoming. There was great outdoor seating too but I choose to sit at the bar. The bartender wasn't as attentive as I would have hoped. Overall great experience. Also the brewery is in Downtown Scottsdale so there is a lot to walk around and see. After I was done I headed to Creamistry! Definitely try Outlaw, by far my favorite beer of the night.",

The pulled pork was nice and smoky.  It was pretty big for an individual pizza with nice thin crust.  My wife had the grilled shrimp salad and she enjoyed that as well. I had the house IPA called Wobble.  Nice and hoppy without knocking you over.  Will definitely stop in my next time through.",

Nachos were inedible as the tortilla chips were so hard it hurt your jaw to get through it.  Give the manager props, he did take them off the bill and explained that they have been having serious problems with them.  They are nachos....no risotto.  There are nearly 1000 restaurants in Phoenix that consistently cook tortilla chips, how is this a \"serious problem\".  The beef sandwich was pitched as a favorite of the Two Brothers owners from Chicago and to get the giardineira like the True Italian beef.  This was not an Italian Beef (see picture).  This was a poor man's french dip.  They didn't understand what it even meant to \"dip\" the beef in the juice and just served it with a side of traditional au jus.  Ordered the salt & pepper fries, received fries with the truffle oil but no parmesan.  So I didn't get to try the truffle & parmesan fries or the salt & pepper fries...just a bad combination of neither.  I asked the server where the recipes came from and he said they were originally from the corporate store back home but some new guy from Cordon Bleu was changing everything.  Not sure how that is working out for them....",

We decided to check it out and were so pleased we came back the next day. I had the 2 organic eggs breakfast with applewood smoked bacon potatoes and toast. The potatoes were cooked perfectly and they were served with not just grilled onions but caramelized onions. The presentation was beautiful, the service was excellent.

Let's grab a seat on the patio. I was allowed to choose my table and they would follow with a menu.  Upon arriving at my table, I asked if they could put up the umbrella as it was sunny and warm. Yes. I was told. After a few minutes time, I put up the umbrella myself and carried it into a suitable position.   As I sat with patience waiting for my menu, I digested the wonderful view. It is a great spot to sit outdoors. I finally got up a and got my own menu and waited for my server.  I can't recall his name but he did a good job. It was funny because I ordered a Diet Coke and their wings. He said \"alright, something easy.\" The wings were wings and my simple meal was just that. It will be nicer when they finish the patio extension/remodel.  They might be shooting for retro in dress. My server had on jeans with both knees ripped out. I'm not sure but it seemed odd to me being 30 years in the business. I am getting to be an older cat now. Anyway, I'll try them again with friends once the patio is done. All in all, I give it an OK.  #irishcatv2 #vinosquared #vino2 #vino2ultimate #rebelfoodandwine #jimsboisset",

The value seems so affordable, but maybe that's because I'm comparing to Seattle where I lived most of my life.  What I tried so far, starting with my favorite:  *Cobb salad - not the standard cobb at all, it was soooooo good!!   *Salmon Veracruz - it was cooked perfectly, very moist. Love the Veracruz sauce. (Yes, I'm reading off their menu right now.)  *Wild Mushroom pizza - I'm not a huge pizza fan, but this was to die for. I kept going back for more slices.  *Truffle Parmesan fries - Delicious!  * Broccolini side dish - I thought there was a little too much olive oil but it was still good.  I'm not a big beer drinker, but my beer connoisseur daughter tells me that the quality of the beers at Two Brothers is right up there with the beers at a highly-rated brewery chain in Seattle.

Inside a large open area with many tall pub tables, a large u shaped bar, and then more tables around the room. We sat at the bar, greated by Russell, and enjoyed our beer & food. They have a large beer menu, which is made up of mostly house made beers. But I love it, the list was diverse and worthy of exploring. I started with Twenty Plus Pilsner, a smooth drinking beer that was perfect. My husband had the High Noon, a cream ale.  The bar menu has all you want, we ordered the Beer Brezen (soft pretzel) & Margherita pizza. Both were served hot and satisfyingly good in flavor. We then each enjoyed another beer each, Ancestral Recall & Dragon Eyes.  Overall we like Two Brothers Tap House, and plan to return. Especially since they are within walking distance of our hotel.

Super slow restaurant and still appetizers took over 30+ and I am not doing the \"this is taking forever timeline\".... literal 30+ minutes. Teach your staff to interact with patrons and create a fun atmosphere, not just to order take, run and hide. Dirty ambiance which shows there isn't much of a budget for cleanliness. Board games are a great idea and fun to play at a brewery, however, they are all so old and broken just throw them away or just buy new ones. It was an ongoing joke with other patrons and the \"stellar service\" so that's not good. I ran many restaurants so hopefully this is taken with a grain of salt if you want to improve and actually obtain repeat business. No bueno 2 brothers, we won't be back anymore as this wasn't our first experience. Oh p.s. food came out wrong after all that time",

    "text": "If you've read any of my spring training ballpark reviews, you already know I'm a die hard Cubs fan. And if you paid any attention to all the other reviews, you probably also know that I enjoy good beer. Put the two together and you've got a post season visit to Two Brothers Tap House and Brewery in Scottsdale.  One of my co-workers suggested we find a nearby bar with Chicago connections to watch the World Series. We decided on Two Brothers which is more than just a bar. They brew about half of the beers on the menu on site. The other locations in Illinois apparently brew the rest. I sampled five of the beers, the first four via a flight and the last in a pint.  There is something distinctive about the choices. Some of the varieties are not your usual beer styles. For example, they offer a French Country Ale named Domaine Dupage, which is a dark shade of caramel and incredibly smooth. In fact, with the exception of the Weisscracker (a tart, lemon unfiltered beer) all the beers I sampled were smooth. My final selection was a pint of Outlaw IPA which offered a new take on my favorite style. It's got that juniper aroma but the IBU's are kept in check by the smooth character. It's good!  I wish I could also rave about the menu, but we filled up on appetizers. The entrees must be amazing because the Beer Battered Cheese Curds and the Chimichurri Nachos (we added beef) were excellent! I was seriously full after sharing the huge portion of nachos. And thus, disappointed that I couldn't sample some coffee with desert.  This place has great atmosphere! And there was at least one television showing the Blackhawks game. Any Midwest transplant or visitor would feel right at home. Because I didn't get to fully experience the menu, Two Brothers is on my list for a return visit. Go Cubbies!",

I was allowed to take over and decorate the balcony area - and it was perfect! First, I am so glad you allowed me to lead a Paint Party - that, by itself, was brave! Even more, everyone was so patient as I arranged and rearranged the layout to figure out how to execute on my vision. The manager and staff helped me get the considerable amount of supplies to the party space and, even, helped set up easels! Keeping the early arrivers downstairs until I was ready and the set up support helped ease my stress so much! PLUS, they, even, helped cart all those supplies out in a timely manner afterwards - when I was tired and making a few less trips was even more appreciated. The food was FANTASTIC! It tasted great and it was beautifully presented. The chefs came out to meet us - which was a nice touch.  Two waitresses were assigned to our party of about 30 people. They were friendly and helpful. They tried to anticipate our needs and made sure there was never an empty mimosa glass!   Two Brothers made me look like a pro-party planner! I look forward to being able to celebrate with you again!",

Super cheesy, just the way it should be.   I love that they are dog friendly because that means we can bring our little brat. Our waiter was new, but he was extremely knowledgable and attentive.

They run a brewery and tap house and everything is based on beer, but yet at Happy Hour they do not offer any discounts on beverages, just half price on greasy appetizers. They are cocky because since they own a few places in Chicago already, they think they can swoop in and all of Scottsdale will follow like the pied piper. Chains fail here too and personally I'm fed up with the Chicagoization of the valley. Take your Windy City dogs and beef and lousy beers back to your cold and vanilla land of the midwest. I tried several beers and they really lacked the depth and taste of other breweries. Once all the midwest folks leave, here is hoping that Tap Brothers heads back home where they belong.",

    "text": "We recently hosted a rehearsal dinner and meet and mingle at Two Brothers.   We searched the area for several months for a place for this special occasion.   Choosing Two Brothers turned out to be the best possible decision we could make.  We initially spoke with one of the managers.  He showed us the different spaces and provided us with information and sample menus.   We decided to reserve the upstairs area which is great for private parties.   It's really nice because it has an open view of the entire place while still being private.   One of the reasons we reserved Two Brothers is that they are so easy to work with, flexible, and willing to listen and customize the menu and entire experience based on what we want.  Over the holidays, we (my family) stopped in for lunch one day and we all ordered something different so we could try many of their dishes.   I noted our favorites... and we also walked around the space upstairs and discussed how we wanted everything set up.  I worked with another manager on all the details for the event.  I met with her in person and gave her my thoughts on how I wanted the tables arranged and also went over the timing, food menu, drink choices, and all the details on how I pictured our events.  This was actually like two consecutive events in one night.    She was such a pleasure to work with.   She took notes on everything I said, answered any questions I had, provided follow up choices on things such as desserts and then sent me a typed document showing all the details we discussed with detailed pricing information.   She was able to incorporate all of my ideas and choices exactly how I described them to her.  I was really impressed!   She even had custom menu's printed just for our event.  They looked great!  Her attention to detail was so impressive.  Our rehearsal dinner and meet and mingle event at Two Brothers exceeded every expectation I had!   Everything was perfect!   She made every single detail a reality.  Even the timing of serving appetizers, food, desserts was exactly how I wanted.   I did not need to remind her or the servers of anything.   They have a remote bar upstairs which was staffed for our event.   There were three bartenders/servers dedicated to our event.   They were absolutely amazing!  The manager I worked with had briefed them on everything so they knew exactly what to do and when.   They took such great care of our group!   They were professional, happy, caring, efficient individuals who provided our party with unparalleled service!   Two Brothers sure knows something about hiring good people because they were truly the best of the best.   I am typically pretty good about noticing things that are less than perfect and with so many details I thought it would be difficult or even impossible not to have several things in which I might be even slightly critical about.  Let me just say ... there was not one single thing!  They exceeded my expectations in every single area.  I received so many positive comments from guests we had at our event on how much they enjoyed the food, the service, and literally everything about the evening.  It was really such an amazing night that we will never forget.   What a great way to kick off the wedding weekend!  Oh... I forgot to mention... we love Two Brothers beer as well!   A couple of weeks before the event, my son and I stopped by and tasted a number of their beer selections.  We had a great time at our tasting and really enjoyed experiencing all the different flavors.  Our guests at our event really enjoyed the beer and wine as well.  Thanks to everyone at Two Brothers for making our event so amazing and memorable!",

Ask to just nuke them quick. (We had to get her over since she never checked in) then our sloppy sandwich that looked like it was dropped on the floor and thrown on a plate came out. NASTY AND UNAPPEALING. We had to ask several times for the check. It was VERY unpleasant. There was never an apology we also waited a good 25 mins to get the cold pretzels back.

The menu looks good, what we tried wasn't great so we are hoping that as time goes on it improves. Our server was very nice, he seemed new and getting used to everything which wasn't any big deal to us - he let us know they just started brunch so we will be trying that out Sunday. Overall, we are all hoping for this places success, there's a lot of options in Old Town to go to but this place just had a good vibe and good people and we enjoyed it.

The reason for the missing two stars was mainly the service. Bar staff just stands around in the back and doesn't acknowledge newcomers that sit down. Due to large location, it tends to always feel empty, but gains stars for dog friendly patio.",

I liked the pizza a lot, and my brother said the burger was good too. The only thing that was really odd was that the restaurant was SO empty for a Saturday evening and we really weren't sure why.

Upon arriving with our dog, the waitress offered to bring over a water bowl with ice for our little guy, which is always appreciated.  Service was great. We were sat quickly and our waitress was very attentive to our needs. Also, loved our dog!  Food, also great. First dish was the Poke, which is Raw tuna, sesame seeds, mango, wonton chips, etc. Dish was excellent and flavorful. Second dish was the nachos with pork. Also very good, and filling!   Drinks were also quite enjoyable, with the white sangria full of flavor and the Wobble beer an enjoyable IPA.  Two meals plus two drinks around $40-$45.   We will definitely be back!",

I would recommend going with the beers brewed on site versus the ones that are shipped in from the main brewery. All of the beers are solid however, and are well made and drinkable! Service is friendly and efficient, and the BT's are educated about the beers they are pouring. I have not tried the food here, but the menu looks good, and some of the dishes I've seen coming out of the kitchen looked pretty tasty! So all in all it's worth a stop in if you're in the area!",

    "text": "We hit this place up before going down to Fox to smoke some cigars.  We got there around 1:30pm and were seated at a high top table right away.  My buddies ordered a couple flights of beers, and I went with a chocolate chip cookie skillet type dessert (It was cheap, only like $3.50!).    The cookie was pretty good...not as good as other places that do this type of dessert, but still hit the sweet tooth right in the gut!  It's a big chocolate chip cookie in a skillet, topped with ice cream.  The skillet was a tad too hot though, so it started to melt the ice cream right away. I got a few decent sized scoops of ice cream with my spoon, but after awhile, it became more like ice cream soup along with my cookie.  Still good, but could have been better.  My buddies loved the beer here.  They both got a flight (one buddy got 2 flights) and a pint each.  Said it was the best beer they had all weekend (we went to a few different spots).    Service was great...forgot the name of our server, but she had a Sasha Grey type look to her.  Very friendly and welcoming!    I will definitely be back to try out some of their food.  Everyone around us was ordering burgers, guacamole, cheese curds etc and everything looked fantastic!  They also have a California Burrito on the menu (I'm definitely ordering that next time!) which is rare, but awesome!  Good times!",

    "text": "I'll be honest, I was really disappointed in this visit. I'll also say, I've been here PLENTY of times before when I lived in Tempe and haven't been in awhile. It was always the place we'd meet up with friends a couple times a month. I'm giving it 3 stars to account for the great times and experiences in the past; but I'll say this most recent experience was not good and would probably be only 2 stars.   We came here right around lunch. It wasn't too busy when we arrived but as we left it was picking up.   We ordered two burgers, which we've had in the past and used to be flavorful and delicious - I was REALLY looking forward to lunch. This time, we really weren't impressed. They did not seem hand crafted and the flavors weren't bold and tasty as I remembered. It seemed pretty run of the mill. The fries were great as always though. My girlfriend got the tap house burger, which was supposed to have chorizo on it. She said in the past it had the chorizo on top of the burger and the menu sounded like it would, but this time it was not there. We asked the waitress and she said it 'might' be combined with the meat... but she seemed unsure. It did not look any different than my burger, which didn't have anything mixed into it. The flavor was off and we really didn't feel satisfied it was correct.   You can't beat the brunch drink menu prices though. $4 for a monster mimosa, sangria, Bloody Mary (and there was one more.) I got a Bloody Mary, which was good but just not my favorite drink in general (not a tomato juice fan). My girlfriend got a mimosa, which lived up to being monsterous and great. We'd come back here for these drinks! I was gonna get sangria but they were out, which was also disappointing.   The service was slow from beginning. After being seated the waitress took our drink order and walked away before we could give her our food order, which we knew from past visits. When she came back we ordered the food. After getting our meal she followed up briefly once and it was in passing when it appeared she had just remembered we were there. She asked if we were okay and began to walk away quickly before an answer was given. We stopped her as she was leaving to ask for additional sauces, which took awhile to get. Then she never came back until about 10 minutes after we finished to ask if we wanted our check...  Overall, I was really disappointed. The food wasn't that delicious and had no real flavor. The service was slow and we felt like we were just waiting around. As mentioned, we've been here before and loved the beer and all the food (we've tried a lot of it) but I don't think I'd get a burger again based off today. We gave it 3 stars hoping this was just a one time thing based on our past experiences; otherwise it would have been 2 stars.",

We stopped in about an hour before they closed.  The space is huge! Two floors and very open full of tables for dining.    I was pretty impressed with the number of beers they had.  I went with an IPA, wasn't terrible impressed with it.  It was hard put my finger on it, or tastebuds why I didn't like it. The beer tasted kind of skunky, and there could be other factors for it tasting like that.    My favorite part was the area of different board games including Nebraskanopoly (Monopoly but Nebraska focused?).  I schooled all of my friends in Connect Four and we still enjoyed ourselves.",

They have a huge dining room and a huge food menu -sandwiches, burgers, pizzas, appetizers, and salads. I did see one cool thing on the menu - Hoisin-Sriracha Glazed Brussels Sprouts !   After our beers, we checked out their cool souvenir store. We enjoyed our visit quite a bit, and agreed if we lived here, this would definitely be in our dinner rotation.",

You can only put your name on the list in person. I tried calling because we had our dog, but that was a no go.  They don't have much space to wait around for the table except a small bar area or you will have to wait on the sidewalk.  We were able to get something fast enough and our dog liked the lounge couch/fire pit. A lot of seating inside and good number of tv's for sports.",

The guacamole is really good and I love the pico de gallo sodalicious the pizza is good it's just regular pizza but I do like it. The cheesecake is to die for it does change flavors I've had the strawberry and I'll had the butterscotch it's so good. the staff is really friendly and they take good care of you. I love the beer.

We went to take some friends to the airport after visiting and we all decided to check out the tap house!  Located in the heart of an area of business and shopping trying to find street parking wasn't super easy but wasn't a challenge by any means either.  The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating for us with two small children.  The entire bar was clean and inviting and the waitress took the time to make recommendations on various beers when I ordered my flight.  The food was outstanding!  The cheese curds were extremely crispy but still light and not over the top.  The Brussels sprouts were very good with a great flavor profile but with the soy sauce on them they were a little on the salty side (definitely a dish to share!)  It was raining as we went so the beer garden wasn't open but it looks like a wonderful place to enjoy an evening after work drink as well!",

The menu is not your typical bar food it's loaded with a variety of items you would never think of as well as a twist to items you may not have thought of. I ordered the fried chicken.  Thought I was getting a typical half chicken pan fried with a side of gravy and potatoes.  Not here.  I got all white meat served in a tasty sauce with a huge side of Mac and cheese with a tasty green bean red pepper side.  Everyone at the table wanted a taste.  My wife had the tap house burger with the chorizo and it was amazing. Tasty but not hot with spice.  Not sure how they did it.  I washed it down with an Ebel's Wiese.  As authentic German beer as you can get.   We sat outside in the heated patio.   Great experience.  Here's a tip.  The restaurant next door offers valet.  I pulled up to drop off my wife and I just asked them if we could valet and they said no problem.  So valet parking, great food and the best beer in the world.  This place is great.",

The food was really good and well presented. The staff was very hit and miss. A few were engaged and excited about the place, but most were not. Both types were very transparent! Overall, we were very happy.   I noticed they had breakfast and were also a coffee roaster.Hmm... I was anxious to check that out and returned for coffee the next morning. Bottom line- It's a good idea, but skip the breakfast and go for beer and food. The coffee tasted like hot water, the service in the morning was terrible. 2.00, and 2 sips of 'coffee' later, I dumped it in a planter and took off looking for a good cup of coffee.",

Got seated right away, as it was pretty slow. Still - took close to 10 minutes for our server to show. Still, we ordered an app, food for the kids, and a beer sampler. All came out quick and we had no issues. The biggest issue we had was when our meals came. My wife ordered a Cuban panini. On the menu it was to come with pork loin, ham, provolone, and fixings. What we got had bacon, pork, a red pepper, avocado. We asked the waiter and he said \"no, that's turkey\" took it away but came back with the same sandwich swearing it was the Cuban. Odd... It was OK and we're not the type to fight so we said ok, no problem. The manager came by a few minutes later and swore the sandwich was what we ordered but offered to make something else for my wife.  LEARN YOUR MENU. It's not on us to tell you how to make the food on your menu, but if a Cuban is ordered, serve a Cuban. Good thing is --- their beer is available at other places. Places that know how to get an order right.  I am debating whether to chalk this up to new place learnings, or take it more seriously.  All said, the burger I ordered was great, the kids liked their meals, and the beer was good. Just wish we didn't have to deal with this. We know what we ordered, and what we got wasn't it.",

For food, I had the cheese curds, chips & guac, and the fish tacos and everything was very fresh and tasty. The place is very nice inside and out.

They also have an awesome patio that mirrors Scottsdale road which makes for some great people watching. Their food is great, and their beers that they brew themselves are amazing. It's located within walking distant of all the other bars in Old Town, which makes it ideal for a Saturday night randevu spot. But it always boils down to their great service, I will be back!",

Finally, after months we finally made our way over to the new brewery in old town Scottsdale. Big open floor plan, parking can be a little annoying though because they don't have their own parking lot. We parked across the street.   We ordered a ceasar salad, Cuban sandwich, truffle fries and sonoran cole slaw. Everything tasted great the Cuban came out nice and toasty. Fries were hand cut but crisp. I drank the Scottsdale shandy made with their EPA while my boyfriend enjoyed the domain dupage draft.  We will definitely come back. We'll make sure to come earlier next time because happy hour is only from 3-6 so we barely missed it",

    "text": "I should start by saying that there needs to be 1/2 star rating increments if possible. But \"Meh, I've experienced better.\" pretty much sums it up. Now, on with the review...  The great: The beer. I had the Domain Dupage which was lovely, amber, crisp and delicious. I was really happy with it. My husband had the Cougar Ale which he described as a \"Budweiser with good flavor\". He's not really great with words. The Back Home Burger that I ordered was spot on. Blackberry steak sauce, blue cheese and fried onions on a perfect medium beef patty that was hot and juicy and inside a delicious brioche bun. The salt and pepper fries were great, and just in case you aren't truffle-parmesan fried to death yet, they offer those too.  The good: The chorizo queso dip was tasty, if lacking in any real cheese flavor. The chorizo was nice. A little spicy, but not \"burn your mouth\" hot. The chorizo clumped together so we had to break it up, but still, nice and tasty.  The WTF moment: The ribs. Holy God, please send the chef a vision of how to properly cook ribs, or at least remind him that ketchup is not a rib sauce. From texture to temperature to taste, these were the worst ribs we've ever had. Super tough and rubbery to chew, cold in the middle with just the most god-awful sauce on them. My husband ate a few just to keep from being hungry, but it was pretty bad.  Don't order them!  The service:  Very sweet and non-intrusive without being slow or having to wait an absurd amount of time for anything. Our waitress had a good amount of personal knowledge about the beer and the food and was honest when she hadn't tried something. Always appreciated. She earned her tip.  Verdict:  Beer is top notch and they obviously take pride in it. Burgers appear to be their specialty, or at least what they know well, and are definitely worth it. Skip. The. Ribs.",

Our original plan fell through with another restaurant who had a 1+ hour wait and the patio outside Two Brothers was too inviting to pass up! We started with the cheese curds which could rival ones that I had fresh in Wisconsin. The Beertini was much stronger than you would assume and so tasty I think I finished it within 10 minutes...  I followed it with the dark flight (my favorite being the Northwind) and the glasses were very generous for their cost. (Ended up sharing with the guys) The shortrib sandwich was moist, delicious and the bread was amazing! The three of us could not stop raving and we all sampled each other's order. The truffle fries were perfectly seasoned and an portion large enough to fill you up! After getting drunk, we finished up with getting iced mocha's to go and explore the neighboring stores which also was great! Not too sweet or heavy and the roast on the coffee was perfect. We cannot wait to go back!",

I knew it was going to be a good experience.   The Kickin' Hound cocktail was a pleasant surprise. A mix of vodka, grapefruit juice and, wait for it, pale ale with orange, lemon and pineapple notes. Not a beer drinker and had to try the pale ale by itself to figure out why I was enjoying the cocktail.  It was the beer!  It's a tap house after all.   Then came the pork belly wraps. The pork belly slices in each wrap was generous. It was topped with a pineapple and mango salsa. So yummy I ordered another one to go for lunch. The manager was very thoughtful. He put the salsa in separate containers so it did not make it soggy.   We decided on the Ancho Skirt steak for our entree.    The chimichurri sauce was delightful. Steak cooked perfectly.  Trifecta :)  All the flavors melded together beautifully. But most importantly the service was superb. Definitely coming back.",

    "text": "Worst dining experience ever. After sitting at our table for 10 minutes and then asking if we even have a server, someone finally attended to us. We ordered drinks and an appetizer right away... The appetizers did not arrive until over 30 minutes from when we first arrived. The manager was the one to deliver them and seemed annoyed that I wasted his time expressing my concern with how slow the food and service was. I'm too annoyed to type out the full details of our visit so I will put it in point form.  - Nothing was cleared from our table from start to finish, including empty plates, glasses and even our menus  - They double charged me for my salad when the first one came out with meat. (In my servers defense, the meat thing was my error. I expected a traditional Greek salad which does not come with meat and I did not closely read the menu)  - They should stick with tradition on some things... My Greek salad tasted nothing like a Greek salad. It didn't even have a vinegarette  dressing or come with olives!  - Not sure if our server was given too many tables to manage or if he was just slow, but the service was unbelievably slow.  - Food was good, but took forever.  - Side sauce for our fries arrived 20 minutes after we ordered it. The fries were cold and soggy at that point.  I'm not sure where or why our dining experience fell apart, but every aspect of it was disappointing with the exception of our server being friendly. He was very nice and apologetic... I just wish the apology could have been delivered with better service.  Upon realizing I was double charged for my salad after paying the bill, I was too annoyed to wait another 20-30 minutes to have it adjusted so I left. The place is rarely busy and now I know why.   I will never return.",

We were never asked if we wanted refills on drinks either.  When we asked for the checks to be split, we were told yes but that it would take much longer.  Indeed, we waited a long time for those checks to come, as if we were being punished for a perceived misdeed.

Two servers walked by our table at least four times, so it's not like we were hiding in a corner invisible to the world. We overheard a woman at another table complain about waiting forever to place her drink order. After hearing that we set a one minute timer and agreed to leave if we didn't receive service before then. We sat for a total of 10 minutes and then we left. Super bummed about this because the beer and the food looked great.   Not sure what their deal was, but they definitely dropped the ball on this one. I said something to the hostess when we left, so hopefully the feedback makes its way back to management.",

I started off with the Revelry IPA and really enjoyed it. The Outlaw was good but more of a standard IPA...easy to drink.  For dessert, I went with the brewed in house oatmeal stout. It was excellent. Just the right amount of sweet and the added lactose gave it a great texture.    For food I just had the Scottsdale wings with the jerk dry rub.  They were good, but not mind blowing. I'll try one of the sauces next time.    The service was fine.  There were only 2 other people at the bar so I had no problems getting anything I needed.

We came around lunch and the place was completely empty. I liked the vibe of the place though and they had a good patio. The location of the restaurant is also nice.   The beer menu was pretty standard but I felt like multiple beers didn't add up to what they looked like or tasted like. The descriptions were definitely off or we got the wrong beers.   We ordered the chicken wings in medium sauce, the cheese curds, and a margarita pizza. The wings and the cheese curds were pretty average. The pizza was absolutely terrible and had absolutely no flavor. My cousin literally poured salt on hers to make it taste better, which also didn't help. In general, the pizza was overly bland and had no hope of being saved.   The service was average as well. She was a little over the top at first, then forgot about us for about 20 minutes. She also forgot a couple different things we asked for.   I definitely would be open to going back and trying something else, maybe a burger or something. It has great potential.",

The pretzels were some of the best pretzels I've ever had and the beer cheese was awesome. The cheese curds were lightly battered and fried, and the horseradish sauce gave it a nice kick.

I got a memosa with my meal for an additional 2.00 and friends Bloody Mary what a deal.      Food was great, I got the 2 egg and my applewood bacon was thick and crispy, hash browns skinny and perfectly seasoned, friend got pancakes with berries and other fruit, she really like it, plate was clean and other eggs Benedict with avacado and sauce on side she was the healthy one.    We enjoyed our meals and the fact we were not rushed through our meal.  Had we gone to the other place we would not have enjoyed or meals or each other's company.    Two brothers is large and not crowded and full at was open and had a few patrons around their large bar.  It was great to have good food, low noice so we could chat and nice music in background.  When we were leaving lunch crowd were arriving.   They have seating low and high tops inside and on a very nice patio with comfy seating.    Dog friendly patio  We will be back for breakfast again.

The smell of money I tell you!  I like to sit at the bar when I go out to lunch, you know really live a little. Jennifer, who's a great bartender, was quick to greet us with a friendly smile and an introduction to their locally made beers. By local I mean brewed above the bar. #ohyoufancy. She gave us a great walk through of each of the beers and asked if we would like one? One I said in shock?! I'll have one of each. By then my co worker was co(drunk)ughing giving me an evil stare.  I said Michelle it's called a flight, ok. I know how to keep it classy.  What's important about Jen is I really wanted to spend the rest of the day enjoying each of their fine hand crafted beers. She wouldn't allow it. With a stern yet pleasant tone she said one and back to work with you. It's good to have responsible people in your life otherwise it would have been me drunk in an uber several hours later. Side note - anyone else ever use an Uber kind of like a therapist? It's great you get into the car drunk get to talk about what ever/ whom ever you want and boom you are home. I love it!  After that I ordered the ham and cheese panini which was more then enough food. Really enjoyed my lunch and look forward to going back.",

    "text": "I'm always excited to try a new place, and in the case of Two Brothers, I'm really glad we did!! A few friends recommended we give it a shot, as they'd been there to try it recently and the food was supposedly really good... So, Super Bowl weekend when everything was swamped, we found a little refuge in this cool, new spot!  The location is great, on North Scottsdale across from Bungalow, and the building itself is very nice. It has a clean but industrial feel, as most breweries do, with awesome skylights that make the place feel fresh and bright. Seating extends up to the second floor, though we sat on the first, and there appear to be plans to put in some large fermentation vats up there, which will be cool.  The menu looked incredible and I wanted to try everything! To start, we shared some smoked salmon and the pretzels. The salmon was okay - not as much my thing, and there wasn't a whole lot of pita/veggies for the amount of dip you get. The pretzels were great, though, and I'd definitely get them again!! I had a hefeweizen that was great and had a strong banana/vanilla flavor.  For my main meal, I was struggling between the fish tacos or the chicken sandwhich, both of which sounded amazing. The waitress was helpful and recommended the fish tacos... I think they sat in front of me a solid 30 seconds before I inhaled them! They were great!!! The batter was light, and everything tasted fresh. The quinoa I got with it wasn't great. I guess I was expecting it to be hot, and when it was cold with a very seedy texture, I left most of that on my plate. I'd probably try the parm fries next time, as the waitress said that those are a big hit.  After we ate, we hung out for a while and I decided to try one of the beer cocktails. It was gin and an IPA, and boy, could those get me into trouble!! I'm not normally an IPA fan, but the hops with the gin made for a great combination! Definitely not something I would've thought to combine on my own, but I loved it!!!  Give this place a shot - I really hope it sticks around!",
