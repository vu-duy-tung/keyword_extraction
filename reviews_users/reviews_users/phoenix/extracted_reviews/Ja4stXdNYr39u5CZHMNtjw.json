The managers did everything to accommodate our needs before the event, including gluten free options for a few guests. Any questions that I emailed to them were answered promptly. And I have to say, this was not the case with other places. We had the upstairs and our own bar. The food was hot, abundant, and wonderful!! If you have a large party,this is the place to go. The price was great too!",

It was busy, had to give the hostess number of party and our number to call. So finally half hr later. Went back. The hostess had to find a table. She said \"ok we have a table upstairs\" mind you it's three adults and two kids. So we go upstairs. She literally seats us in a table of 4 ALL the way in the corner like we were on punishment. These tables are super small and good for 4 people. My husband  is a big guy there was no way we can all fit in. So finally we decided to just get up and leave. When we told the \"hostess\" how can she seat 5 people in a 4 seat table she said that was all they had. Are you kidding. You couldn't tell us this the moment we decided to be on the waiting list. The hostess are terrible. They need to change up whoever is in the front dealing and figure out a better communication with the customers. It was pretty disappointing that was her answer instead of helping and wanting to make us happy.",

The food was really good otherwise it probably get it one or two stars in fact I got the extra third start just because the churros Sunday was so amazing  Someone did say in Kylie's defense she was the only server in the whole restaurant I don't know but that shouldn't be my problem anyways.

Guacamole tasted like it was out of a salt-can.  Queso had lumps of cheese in it, not even melted.  Taco's were terrible - who puts cheddar cheese on taco's?  Really dry meats, not much of it on there.  Just a few frozen shrimp laying on a bed of dry rice?  Seriously?  The chicken tortilla soup tasted like chili.   It was a rough meal.  So, I guess if you just want a cheese crisp, come here.  I wouldn't touch anything else.",

The papas & chorizo taco was tasty too. I didn't care for the Diablo shrimp taco (which is odd because I LOVE guajillo chiles) but my husband thought it was great...to each their own! Fabulous & flavorful black beans.  The bad next...! I have never waited so long for chips & salsa at a Mexican restaurant ever in my life. In fact, I thought maybe we needed to order them but our waitress assured me they'd be right out. Ten minutes later we had to ask another waitress, who brought them out right away. Then we waited even longer for our appetizer guacamole. It was a little too tangy and topped with pomegranate seeds...just okay. Neither of my kids liked the food here. Both thought the Tinga chicken rolled tacos were too spicy. (I didn't think so.) They don't have any gringo items on the menu for kids or other picky eaters (& no ketchup). Of course, if everyone in your party digs Mexican food, this isn't a problem. We ordered 2 flour tortillas for the kids since they didn't eat any of their food. Then we had to wait 20 minutes for the tortillas to be delivered, but the waitress took them off the check due to the long wait. I don't know why she couldn't just call out the order instead of waiting for them behind big meal tickets, though. (I used to wait tables at a Mexican restaurant years ago.)  My husband and I will definitely be back. We'll just leave the kids at home next time!",

For those of you who don't want to read my rant, food is awful and made us physically sick.  My boyfriend and I split the chicken fajitas and his dad had the chili relleno, which he said was mediocre. There's no other way to say it, our fajitas were horrible! There were a total of 8 small pieces of tough non-delicious chicken. I kid you not, EIGHT PIECES! And I swear there must have been a whole large onion in it. That, paired with the canned beans and dry rice, had both me and my boyfriend sick all night and part of the following morning. And to wrap it all up, the waitress forgot my boyfriends drink which isn't a big deal but she also forgot she was at work and literally had to flag her down from playing on her phone. The only thing we liked there was my mango Margarita. Props for that I guess...",

You could tell the bartender was not too happy about us showing up.  He offered us drinks and I had to request a menu, then he stood there staring at us while we decided what to order.  We ended up ordering 3 different kinds of tacos.  He failed to ask us if we wanted flour or corn tortillas, and they came out with flour tortillas; I am not a fan of flour tortillas.  It was just not a pleasant dining experience aside from my company.    I can say they have a great taco Tuesday Happy Hour, but otherwise, I would never come here for anything else.",

That said, my husband, mom-in-law and I had lunch here last week and we thought the tacos and the margaritas were spot on!   I lived in Phoenix some 20+ years ago and the *good* Mexican restaurants in Phoenix became my benchmark for Mexican food.  Granted, all we ate here (at Cien Agaves) were the tacos, rice and beans but, it's surprising how easy it is to mess up a taco.  I sampled the grilled ono, shredded beef and I think the carne asado taco.  All were good but my favorite was the shredded beef... I had a moment with that one.. (picture the scene in Disney's Ratatouille when the food critic samples Remy's ratatatouille).  I was transported to 1986. The margaritas we had deserve their own paragraph.  They use fresh ingredients and it shows!  One look at the first page of the menu and you know THEY know their tequila.  Find out when happy hour is as we learned you can get some very good deals.",

Both are usually quite delicious, not this time.  The ceviche had absolutely no flavor to it. As if the chef tried to make it as flavorless as possible. I did not finish it as it was not enjoyable in the least. Now for the tacos. Stale taco shells, dried and overcooked chicken, slopped on guac and no pico de gallo. The tacos were so bad I tried to rescue them by asking for pico de gallo, since they did not put any on, and then I was charged $1.00 extra. Of course, no manager was anywhere in sight. This place simply doesn't care. On the bright side, the margaritas and salsa are still good, but the chips were stale.  Not only will I not return, but I can no longer recommend this place to businessmen from out of town. I see dozens of new business people every day who stay in Scottsdale and they always ask for Mexican food, and I've always said Cien Agaves. No more.",

I'm a big tequila fan and Cien Agaves offers over 100 tequilas! I was tempted to try them all but only had the house margarita which they claim is the best in town. I'd like to say it was the best house margarita I've ever had.   I also ordered the happy hour special tacos. They were well made and delicious. We were pleased with this pub and will return very soon.",

Food was less than mediocre. We only ordered veggies quesadillas. It was cut in four pieces and the two end pieces had cheese and no veggies. We asked for extra veggies on the next order and it was a tad improved but nothing special. Service was fair to bad. The server forgot silverware, forgot extras we asked for three times, forgot to ring our check had to ask twice to get the check and she said she wondered what was in her pocket. It was the clipboard with our credit card and cash.The worst part though was sitting on the patio two of the people in the party had to face the alley and the garbage cans which, well, smelled of garbage. Won't be back anytime soon. Very disappointing.",

So when you go on a day they have a special be prepared to wait a few minutes.  For it being my first time there, I would have enjoyed it more if the waiter was a little more kind to the customers.

My boyfriend pulled a long black hair out of his fajita, which, our waitress had her hair down, and had long black hair. We informed her about the hair, she said, I will be right back. Only to go see, that she put her hair up before speaking with her manager about it. He comes up to the table. Is completely rude to us. Asks us to show the hair after my boyfriend had flinged it to ground in disgust. Needless to say, after how rude they were about it, I will never be going again",

You can order anything off the menu and be assured it will be delicious.  We always start off with their perfectly fresh guacamole, Cien Agave's guacamole is soooooo delicious it has the perfect blend of fresh avocado, onion, cilantro and topped with refreshing pomegranate seeds, so mouthwatering.  But our \"go to\" is the 10 taco platter, you can mix and match any tacos off the menu and you can request your tacos be on soft flour tortillas, my favorites though are the DIABLA SHRIMP, Shrimp sauteed in Guajillo sauce on a bed of Mexican rice, ISLAND SHRIMP,  Beer battered shrimp tossed in their sweet and spicy island sauce on a bed of crispy cabbage. CARNE ASADA, Citrus marinated skirt steak mixed with pico de gallo and topped with homemade guacamole. Of course you wash it down with the perfect habanero margarita, this margarita is the perfect sweet with that kick of the habanero chili chasing, and this is incredibly refreshing.  Cien Agave's has the perfect vibe, a good looking restaurant.",

I'm sad to say it just wasn't good. We sat at the bar. We had margaritas, which weren't good. It's supposed to their thing, so I was surprised they haven't evolved over time. It's so easy to get quality, fresh lime margaritas, that I thought they'd be on par with other places in town. They aren't. I've had better at several places including Blanco & CRUjiente Tacos too.   Another odd thing is that the chips weren't good. I can't explain it, but they tasted off for tortilla chips. We also ordered the street corn, but service was spotty the whole time we were there, & we never got it. We finally gave up & asked for the check. It wasn't on there. Nothing says bad service like it even getting your food order. Like they just forgot to even put it in. It's just odd.   Overall, I guess this place appeals to someone, but it sure isn't me. There too many places in town with better margaritas & service.",

Anyone with a kid knows that won't work, so I asked for another table in which she rudely told me they didn't have any. And to top it off the high chair was covered in food and gross. Needless to say we left without eating, and went to our favorite place around the corner, Barrio Queen.  Beware, this place is obviously not kid friendly!",

They were awesome, but the experience was less than memorable. They had some issue where they did not have chicken tinga. Coincidentally a Happy Hour item. But then, it took 20 minuets to get guacamole. In the mean time my party ordered a quesadilla with grilled chicken. Guess what?  We had steak instead. I understand the sh** happens, but the management can't make substitutions?   Maybe try it again, but, maybe not",

I found this place and made reservations online, since one sister wanted Mexican and the other sister that came along loves tequila I figured it was already a homerun.   Walking in its a very cool little joint. Very colorful and vibrant which I liked, and super clean. We got seated right away and I ordered a Guacamole and our drinks to get us going while we figured out what we wanted. They brought out salsa and the guacamole and chips. I love Salsas and as long as you don't try to get too nuts you can make some of the best just with a few ingredients. Unfortunately, these 2 salsa mild and hot were neither hot nor good... They were very sweet and yugh! The Guacamole was very bland. I feel like they just mashed Avocado with some pomegranate drizzled on top, it needed some lime, cilantro, some salt.. You know the basics!   We got our tacos and yes!!! They were actually pretty damn good. I got 2 shredded beef and 2 carne asad and they were delightful. We asked if they had some salsa in the back that was HOT (which most Mexican restaurants do). They did bring some out and with the chips it was pretty weird tasting, but inside the tacos it was delish! It was super spicy just like I love it.   Last thing that surprised me was the Bill... I have never been charged for salsa... Like ever....... This place charges $1.50 for a small cup of Hot Hot salsa, and we had 2 of them. Its not that I cannot afford 3 dollars its just seriously.... $1.50 Each Salsa!!! I was just surprised by this. I would have gotten it anyway if they would have told me up front its just more that I have never been asked to pay for the chip salsa.... At least it made out Tacos complete.",

Love that touch!  I ordered the Hangover Burrito (even though I didn't have one). Was not disappointed! It weighed about 2.5 lbs (I swear) and looked like a toddler's leg. I pumped 3 solid meals out of the fried piece of heaven. Had everything AND MORE stuffed inside.  Service was ehhhhh. Maybe the gal was new, but just kind of felt she was bothered by our table and sort of \"sneery\" tude/vibe coming from her. Dunno but I still gave her decent tip.

Well, luckily I had the privilege to try out Cien Agave for a promo video we filmed and I was impressed!   First I was able to try out the shrimp ceviche...a-ma-zing. It was so fresh and very light in the citrus. Too many times you get a ceviche that is over-powering in the lime juice, but Cien Agaves' is perfectly refreshing.  Then we were able to try out the shredded beef taco, lobster taco, and the Taco Al Pastor. I'm not usually a shredded beef taco fan, but let me just say that I've been craving it ever since. And what's even better is you can get them for $1 every Tuesday! And the Taco Al Pastor (marinated pork and grilled pineapple) was to die for. Yum yum yum. Can I go now please???  And of course the margaritas...they have reeeeeeeaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyy good margaritas. I enjoyed the award winning house margarita...its a really great classic margarita, where they freshly squeeze the citrus, no pre-made crap in it at all. So good. And the cucumber margarita was amazing.   Cien Agaves is just a really great little treasure in Old Town Scottsdale. They have a great atmosphere and a great staff. Go check them out.",

    "text": "Average food, awesome alcohol.  I think my experience here is why I have yet to even attempt the food at bar/restaurant fixtures like Loco Patron or Salty Seniorita.  Maybe Cien Agaves tries to shoot for the restaurant aspect a little more - they might have to with their lack of a patio to rival their competitors.    One thing I've noticed about this place is that it's usually dead except on Taco Tuesday.  There's something charming about eating shredded beef tacos and drinking cans of $2 Tecate with a bunch of affluent white people.  That being said, for a buck the tacos aren't bad and there's live music sometimes which I'm a huge sucker for.  The margaritas are good and strong, which is another of my weak points.  If you don't have to work the next day, I'd also recommend the Tequila Flight, which is $18 for three shots of really good tequila.  Speaking of tequila, they have over 100 kinds!  The only place I've seen come close is El Zocalo in Chandler but I don't think they hit that and they certainly don't have an entire page of a menu devoted to the delicious, cactusy drink.  Skip the food, hit the tequila, and don't plan on making a night out of it because it's often dead.",

The tequila event was upstairs and was run well.  Nice to see Roger selling his own wares (Mexican Moonshine)!  Decided to hang out after event and have cigars on the downstairs patio.  I was initially vary of the service from earlier reviews, but our waitress was attentive and made out taco selections for us.  Tacos were fantastic.  The breaded fish was cooked well and not oily.  The carne asada was tender and the guacamole was fresh.  Even on regular hours the price was right.  Definitely a place to go back for during happy hour.  Only giving four starts since I have not tried more on the menu, but that extra star is around the corner!",

It wasn't a bad meal, it just wasn't a great one.  Drinks-house margaritas are half price until 7pm. We were able to take advantage of that which was a good thing since they were not very strong.  Food-chips and salsa (green and red) are complimentary, but are not brought to the table automatically, you have to ask. And you have to ask for refills on the salsa. Both salsas were very good, nice and fresh. The red salsa was spicy, which I love.  The chips were sub par in my opinion. Some crunchy, some chewy and tough.   Everyone at our table ordered a variation of the two taco meal. The variety of taco options was very good.  I had a carnitas one and a shredded beef one. Carnitas one was very taste, and I liked that I got the option of a soft corn tortilla instead of flour. The beef taco was served in a special shell, I did not care for it. It was a fried corn tortilla that was a little hard to bite into, and did not have a very good taste.    I love trying New Mexican places when traveling, this one unfortunately was a slight disappointment.",

So Saturday night we pull up to this little spot in Scottsdale to meet up with the rest of the crew and sit and have a drink - I ask the bartender give me your best 2 tacos - so I get the carne asada and the mahi mahi-   The carne asada was delicious, it was tender spicy and just melted in your mouth- i instantly gobbled that one up right away- The girl sitting next to me advised me that the mahi mahi was the best she has ever tried at the restaurant. So i drink my drink and talk with my friends, after about 10 min I decided to dive into this scrumptious mahi mahi taco.. only to be left disappointed- if i wanted to have dessert on top of my dinner i would eat it that way- to say the least i wash left unsatisfied with the taco.   My good friend said here try a little bite of this... it's the lobster taco... i said OK why not..   OMG! The flavors were amazing it was spicy, soft and succulent, and just melted on my tongue.. my tongue actually woke up and my mouth was exploding with flavor! This is what i was waiting for...   This is a good little spot - i would definitely come back again- the service was great! friendly and perfect.   my tummy was happy!",

And did I mention the $2 Tecates and Dos Equis and $4 house margaritas all night? If your regular happy hour spot is packed, I'd recommend visiting Cien Agaves.   And apparently, each night is devoted to a different taco, with specials all week long. With an entire page of delicious taco options (including some yummy veggie-friendly options), this is your one-stop taco shop.   The chips and salsa are also tasty and plentiful. They bring you both the chunky, mild red salsa, and a slightly spicier tomatillo version. And the chips are reminiscent of those served at Aunt Chiladas, fluffy and delicious!",

Realize most places like Cien Agave do not take reservations in AZ.  I won't be coming back to Cien Agave as I'm not one to make reservations for a restaurant like this.  Blanco has better food and atmosphere and therefore I'll drive the extra mile to avoid the reservation hassle and lack of tables available.",

I really love the salsa Verde, and everyone around me loved the salsa roja.  Despite my hunger, I wanted to have something a bit on the lighter and cheaper side. The fajita bowl fit the bill and was a great mix of vegetables, rice, beans and cheese. Nothing too fancy but still great.

Needs improvement:  Personal preference, I prefer my guacamole to have more texture.  It had the consistency of lumpy pudding.  But the flavor was okay.  Thank you for not over-salting it.  The pomegranate seeds were a nice touch.  To improve, I would recommend showcasing the ingredients with a medium dice of the avocado,  small dice of tomato, minced garlic, and chiffonade the cilantro.  Maybe a dash of Tajin Clasico seasoning or a light chipotle powder dusting to make it your own.  It can still be creamy by folding the aforementioned ingredients with a little dollop of what you have now.  Like...4:1 ratio.  For me texture helps make a dish like this.  The fried Fish taco needs something wet to balance the dry slaw and fish.  I recommend a lime tartar sauce.  At second look on the menu, I think the Baja sauce was accidentally left off my taco.  Too bad because that certainly would have helped.  The good:  I enjoyed the Skinny Margarita and the Shredded Beef taco.  There's nice variety on the menu so I probably won't order either again.  I want to try something new.  They have something for everyone here.",

    "text": "Cien Agaves is one of my favorite places to go in the Old Town Scottsdale area, and definitely stands out to me as one of the best spots to go to for Mexican food and tacos :) the service has always been great, and it's in a great location -- just a little bit off the main Scottsdale road.  As for the food, I can't say enough good things! They actually offer complimentary chips and salsa (I don't think enough places do anymore), and the salsa is delicious! Their Queso Verde appetizer is a must-have as well, my boyfriend and I tried it our first time here, and we have never not ordered it since. We love queso in general, but the slow roasted green chile pork they add is amazing :)   I will say that the tacos here are a bit expensive, most are $4-$5 each. They're much better quality here than most taco places though, and are served with a ton of meat and cheese, not just filled with lettuce. My boyfriend and I have tried a ton of different ones, and they've all been really good. I also really like to order the Fajita Bowl with Chicken, I think this is the best way to get a lot for your money. The bowl is only $7 and comes with a ton of rice and veggies, and it's only $2-$5 to add meat.   I definitely recommend trying this place if you're looking for Mexican food! Happy hour lasts till 7 which is nice for after work, and there's a ton of free parking. If you can't find a space right in front, there's a huge public lot not too far down the street.",

    "text": "Some friends and I came in wanting margaritas Friday late afternoon (7/19/19) and sat at the bar. The restaurant was not busy and there was only a handful of people at the bar. The bartender(didn't catch her name) literally was doing side work as we sat for a good 8 minutes before she finally acknowledged us from a distance saying \"I'll be with you soon.\" When guests sit at a bar, your first gesture as a bartender should be greeting them with a simple \"Hello, how are you?\" and if you're busy a simple \"I'll be with you in a minute but hey here's a menu to look at\". Maybe she was busy doing whatever she was doing, but you shouldn't leave customers sitting and waiting to be acknowledged while we clearly see her ignoring us. We didn't have the patience to wait for her any longer so we walked out. The hostess asked if we were leaving on the way out out and we said \"Yes\", and she asked \"Why?\" And we replied \"Your bartender sucks\". Well, she did so we got our cocktail fix across the way at Hula's Modern Tika and got greeted and served right away. What a concept! 2 stars, because the food looked good and at least the hostess greeted us. Thank you hostess.",

The BF ordered the Cadillac and I had the skinny margarita but added strawberries to it.  Both were delish.  We started with the chorizo cheese crisp and it was HUGE. So good though! I had a carne asada taco along with a side of rice for dinner and the BF had the pork tacos. We loved everything.  It was a little pricey but I guess that's what you get for having 3 margs on your bill! We'd come back though!",

I've seen cien agaves on my yelp a few times so after the crushbrew fest this spot was walking distance I figured it was the right time. The place is small and super cool with all the decorations and paintings on the walls it definitely catches your eyes so I was stoked to try the food and drinks. The salsas are bomb specially the Red ill give that 5 stars. The food I was disappointed big time. The carnitas were dry and were not carnitas they were more of a machaca dried shredded beef and was way salty. The beans and rice were ok. The drinks again disappointed the margaritas were very sour and watered down,no wayyyyy these are the best or even close. The service was good, amy was friendly and did a great job but, food wise and drinks they were below standards. I think just because they are in old town they have a good rep but there's a lot better and more authentic Mexican food and drinks in 90 percent of phx or scottsdale and cheaper. A lot of hype and not enough substance.",

I had to ask 3-4 times for water before I received it.  It would have helped it there were more servers assigned to our group.  The food was decent. I liked the chips and salsa. For an entree I had a fish taco on a flour tortilla, it was fried fish (just ok).  I asked for extra sauce and that made it better.  I also had an ahi tuna taco on a flour tortilla, that was also good once I added the extra sauce.  My husband and I both ordered a house margarita, it was good.  I think the entire meal from start to finish ended up taking about 3 hours.  I really wanted to try the flan but since it took so long to get the meal, I was sleepy and ready to leave. Even getting our bill took longer than expected.",

I kind of expected it to be good, but not amazing, but I was wrong.  The food was way better than I expected.    I tried 3 different taco's from the 13 they offered, and all 3 were incredibly good.  The free chips and salsa were very good.  They had 2 different salsa's as well, the red was very good, but the green salsa was just incredible.  The bartender said the red just recently won a \"Best Salsa in Phoenix\" award from someone, but I was way more impressed with the green salsa (which I almost didnt try, as just by looking at it, you wouldnt think it would be good).  Pretty friendly environment inside and great staff.    I went for lunch, but it seems like it would get pretty busy for the bar crowd after dinner on the weekends, especially being right next to Patty's 1st Avenue Lounge.  Definitely a cool hangout, and a little nicer on the inside than I expected at least in terms of the tables, but then the booths and the bar seemed like more chill areas and more casual for sure.    I hope this place makes it and stays a long time.  They could use another TV or two in the bar area (at least downstairs), but thats hardly a complaint.  I was very impressed overall.  Definitely worth your time to go check out.",

The atmosphere and seating offer something for everyone.  Indoors for the music and energy, outdoors for the wonderful desert air and a little more quiet while enjoying the warm heaters.

Both beef tacos were superb.  We wanted to try the spicy shrimp one, but decided to save room for the CHURRO sundae : ) YUM! and good thing we did - it was excellent! BF liked the green sauce more, it was sweeter.  On the flip side I preferred the red sauce - it was a bit spicier, and a real treat since I normally ALWAYS prefer green salsa. Also got the grilled corn which was a bit of a let down - it seemed boiled, not grilled, but oh well.  They have lots of specials and if it were later on the evening (as opposed to the early lunch when we were there) we probably would have sampled some of their tequilas/margaritas. Would definitely go back/recommend. Service was great too - no complaints!",

If they invested a little in some art/curtains/less bright lights, I think this place could be considered a fun date place, as opposed to a destination for a grande groups.  Maybe my time back on the East Coast has made me desperate for any kind of edible Mexican, but I did enjoy the food. The queso was a huge hit (turns out chorizo in melted cheese can change lives) and the dos tacos especial (2 tacos- you can mix and match any from the menu + rice + beans = $8.95) made the menu muy caliente to me.",

I found the interior very bar-like and pretty loud but that's fine for lunch.    I was really impressed by their tequila selection and we had two fabulous margaritas during lunch.  My wife absolutely loved the cucumber margarita.  I was a bit skeptical but I did enjoy it.  Especially considering it was 108 outside!     The ceviche was really tasty but the shrimp could have been cut up smaller.  It kept falling off our chips and was much larger than the rest of the ceviche.  We had three different tacos and all were really good and not your typical fare.  I'd say the Taco al Pastor was my favorite but my wife really enjoyed the veggie tacos with the sauteed veggies for the filling.  The other thing to note about the tacos was that there were at least 10 different types.  I wanted to try them all out (just like the margaritas) but that'll have to wait for another time.  Don't know how this place would do for dinner.  I'd highly recommend it for the margaritas and the tacos were good but it's more of a casual place.  The price also seemed okay considering how good the margaritas were but it's not cheap.  We spent $50 for 2 margaritas, 3 tacos and the ceviche.  We had good tequila in the margs so there were in the $9-11 range.  We would definitely come again.",

    "text": "My Husband and I were here a couple of weeks ago.  It was 8:00pm on a Friday night and the place was pretty empty, maybe two or three tables were occupied.    We were there with another couple and ordered several margaritas, their combination platter and a side of guajillo mashed potatoes.  We ordered several different tacos, but the ones I was interested were the Camarones a la Diabla and the Fresh Lobster tacos.  The shrimp was WAY too spicy to enjoy.  I like a lot of heat in my food, but not when it overwhelms everything else.  On the other hand, the lobster and jimaca was bland and lackluster.  I would have to say their selection of tequilas are nice.  I had their Cucumber Margarita and it was very cool and refreshing.  We may come back if I get a hankering for margaritas, if nothing else.  Also, I thought we would be in for an inexpensive night, but I guess with the combo platter, four margaritas and a couple of beers, it came out to be just over $80 a couple.",

After ordering drinks, we waiting what seemed to be a lifetime for the waitress to come back to ask questions about the menu and order. My bf ordered the shrimps tacos but got fish tacos. He ate what he continued to eat them because the waitress never came back to check on the food. He thought they were the worst tacos he had ever had. He did not finish them. Something had got to be pretty bad for him to leave food on his plate. The only time I would ever come back here would be for happy hour but even then probably not.",

    "text": "Hibiscus margaritas...oh how I love you!! Haha   So I was in Scottsdale last weekend, visiting friends and going to the Interpol concert Saturday night. My friend Chantage and I arrived in Scottsdale early afternoon and were immediately whisked away by our friends to Cien Agaves for margaritas and tacos. (I have the best friends in the world!) With so many margarita choices, yes, it was hard to narrow it down to one to start with. But the hibiscus is my favorite flower, so why not try a hibiscus margarita?? Yum, yum and more yum!! And they were in very generous glasses, too! I want one right now and it's only 11am! On the second margarita, we decided to order some tacos. Again, the choices...uh, I wanted them all! But I opted for the Dos Tacos Especial which was my choice of two tacos, beans and rice. I love mahi mahi, so that's what I ordered. Fabulousness, I tell ya! The mahi mahi was grilled to perfection, the beans were smoky and woody but the rice, eh, was okay. Not my favorite. The third hisbiscus margarita made up for it, though! My friends had seared ahi tuna tacos, lobster tacos and carnitas tacos which by the sounds of their 'mmm's and 'ohh's' I can tell you were just as awesome as my mahi mahi tacos!  Our bartender, Blair, was cute, friendly and funny. I hope he enjoyed serving us as much as we enjoyed him! We'll be back to see him (and try other tacos and margaritas) again soon...thanks, Blair! :)",

We ordered guac and chips and drinks to start, 5 mins later ordered dinner. The drinks & guac/chips (which were good) arrive 15 mins after we placed the order & our dinner (which was fair) arrived 2 mins after that. There was barely room on the table for the food, but what was more disappointing is we sensed the restaurant/server was more interested in quick table turnovers. She didn't even ask if we wanted dessert, but just brought out the bill. There are plenty of other Mex-themed restaurants in this city; the food here is not that special. This is not the place to chill and chat.",

We came during lunch on Saturday so no happy hour and no drinks to vouch for.   We ordered the Pollo Asada Burrito and Tres Tacos combo. The burrito was good, not spectacular in the marinade. They kinda went light on the cheese and guac, but the black beans were delicious. For the tacos- we ordered Lobster, Mahi mahi, and shrimp. The shrimp tacos were my favorite. Extremely flavorful, and cooked perfectly. This place can add a little more lobster to the taco, and the mahi mahi was okay.  The service was quick and all the ladies were very nice. Food was mediocre though.",

We live in Payson and the Mexican restaurants up here are pretty bad. Unfortunately, Cien Agaves was disappointing. The restaurant is kind of a Mexican Steampunk decor but we liked it well enough. We found a high-top table & server arrived in a minute or two &  asked what we wanted to drink. I asked for a minute to look at the menu. She walked away without a word. We placed our drink order....a house Margarita for me. She never asked, or provided,  any Chips & Salsa...so I had to ask for them. They have a great selection of Margaritas and tequilas as well as types of tacos. I ordered the 3 taco platter....Shredded Beef, Shrimp Taco and a Fried Fish Taco on corn tortillas...the Fish in the taco was flavorless...needed salt. The cabbage in the tacos was plain old cabbage,, not dressed with anything, bland but I liked the sauce on the Fish Taco. I couldn't eat the Shrimp Taco...just too spicy and the shrimp were just small, frozen shrimp...nothing spectular. The Shredded Beef on the taco was hard, dry and stringy...inedible. I think the Kahlua flan was old. It was way too firm...not creamy and light but I liked the flavor of it. The Green Salsa was enjoyable but the Red Salsa was too watery and too spicy for me. The House Margarita was good but needed just a bit more sweetness.. Our server was unfriendly and spent more time in the kitchen than tending to her customers. Twice I  had to ask another server to find our server...she seemed totally disinterested in providing a good experience to customers. Unlikely to return or refer anyone to Cien Agaves...",

The apps are half off also during happy hr which is till 6 pm.  The tortilla chips are A-Maz-Ing, delish.. the red salsa is pretty fab too. The guac is a NO WAY JOSE'. Doesn't taste like fresh avocados, tastes like processed green mush. the tacos were decent they come with shredded cabbage, cheese, sour cream and shredded beef for 1.50 each on Tues all night.

    "text": "I was introduced to this place by Groupon, and couldn't say no because I am such a big fan of Margaritas. It was a great place for lunch with some friends. It's probably great for dinner with a few friends, too. Service was okay, not spectacular but acceptable. I wouldn't recommend walking in with a large group unless you called ahead (if you can) because they don't seem like they could quickly get stuff situated for you.  I had a breaded lobster taco, shredded beef taco, and Prickly Pear Margarita. My friend had the same, but with a POM-rita instead of the Prickly Pear Margarita. All the Margaritas here are made with fresh ingredients (fresh-squeezed limes, etc.) and not some mixes that have been sitting in bottles in the fridge forever. I honestly like the POM-rita better than the Prickly Pear Margarita, but they were both very good and quite large. However, the Margaritas are really expensive. I would recommend coming during happy hour because they are all half-price during happy hour. Plus, appetizers are half-price then, too. And on Mondays, the house margarita is only $3.00 ALL DAY long. I'll definitely be back for some happy hour margaritas and on a Monday off. As for the Tacos, the breaded lobster taco was really disappointing. The sauce they put on it didn't pair that well with the fried lobster, and the pieces of lobster were overcooked and a bit too chewy/dry for my tastes. However, The shredded beef taco was AMAZING. After I started eating the shredded beef taco, I knew I would be coming back for more of them. It's just a classic shredded beef taco with the classic trimmings in a crunchy taco shell (the shell seemed like it was fried very close to when I ate it, yet wasn't oily and they didn't salt it), but they must be doing something a little different because it was just too damn good.   To sum up, I will be back and definitely recommend this place, but if you want to drink margaritas with some of those awesome shredded beef tacos, I would stick to Happy Hour, because the prices are pretty steep.  **Edit: Just found out from a fellow Yelper that they have $1.00 shredded beef tacos on tuesdays. That just moved it from 4 stars to 5 in my book and I will probably spend way too many tuesdays here. Thanks, Lindsey!",

I wasn't expecting much for $2 but they were fantastic!  They were also a good size (I was expecting them to be pretty small).  I also had a cup of their poblano soup.  Wow, it was so delicious.  It has a lot of heat (which is to be expected), but in my opinion was the perfect amount of heat.  It also had incredible flavor.  The salsas were also both very flavorful (my favorite was the green, although I wish it were a bit spicier).  I will definitely be back here!",

Nearly everywhere was a 30+ minute wait on a Thursday at 6PM, but thankfully they had bar seats, tables, outside seating and high tops available here.   The bartender was extremely nice and knowledgeable. I asked him if the beans were vegetarian, explaining that I eat fish but not any other meat product. He said that they both were, but was quick to let me know that some other items on my order were not vegetarian and then offer substitutions.   I have never had someone so kind and helpful after asking that question! Even my boyfriend, who has had to deal with my dietary questions at restaurants for years, said he was impressed by how cool he was.   I ended up with two salmon tacos and the street corn. It was one of the greatest, lightest, and freshest Mexican meals I've had in a very long time! This place is fantastic for an array of diners. If you're not that hungry, you can order a single taco or sides.   I can't forget about their extensive margarita and tequila menu! Their house marg is my go-to: perfectly tequila-strong with a splash of lime and sweetness.",

Our service was a little slow, or maybe I was just really hungry. LOL.  I also had a two taco plate that was delish, but seriously, that queso verde with the pork in it was to die for!!!!

    "text": "The bangin'est happy hour (3-7 EVERY day!!) in Old Town by miles, Cien Agaves is everything I thought I hated (the fratty old town crowd), but everything that speaks directly to my soul (cheap and delicious). Margs are never even my go to, but at 4 bucks a pop for a delightfully strong house margarita, how could I say no? Also on HH: half priced apps and $2.50 tinga tacos.   You can't really go wrong with any of their tacos, at least in my experience. Shredded beef and carne asada both excellent, and the island shrimp is a bit of a sleeper hit. But I always come crawling back to the tinga. God, it's just fantastic, especially on the hard shells--I'm not usually a hard-shelled taco kinda gal, but these are the perfect amount of crispy fried perfection.   My one small gripe about Cien is that while the food is all amazing, it's pretty hard to get in and out in a tight hour during lunch time. What we've ended up doing in the past is ordering, and then asking for our checks as our food comes out so we can bounce ASAP. Not the hugest deal, just a bit of a hassle gettin' back to that 9-5. That being said, I've always had amazing service; all of the hostesses, servers, and bartenders are super nice and helpful, and check in often to make sure things are still going swimmingly.  One oddball bonus point: their guac comes with pomegranate seeds! Yum!",

The atmosphere here is contagiously fun and with the skulls everywhere and mexican decor adding to the vibe, I felt I had been transported to Mexico minus being frisked by the border patrol.  The shrimp taco was full of zesty full-sized shrimps and was spicy. The shredded beef taco and the chicken one didn't disappoint either. Best of all the shells were fried and crunchy which added to the zesty tasty explosion going on in my mouth! I would definitely come back here if I were visiting Old Town Scottsdale again.  Edit: I believe the actual HOT salsa did cost $0.75 more... but definitely worth it if you're up to the challenge!",

The shrimp tacos are $3 each on Monday's and the Island Shrimp Taco's are bomb! the Diablo Shrimp not as good... the Ceviche is ok, I prefer more lime and salt. However the $5 house margaritas for happy hour are perfect! You can do on the rocks or frozen and I chose frozen. The appetizers were all half off so I got the guacamole too and they have pomegranates in their guacamole! Love it. Finally one of the best things EVER is the cheese bread with carnitas added! IT WAS AMAZING! it comes out like a flatBread pizza with all the right ingredients. I can't wait to bring my family and friends here for dinner and drinks! I'll be back again for sure.",

    "text": "Came to Cien Agaves as part of a group lunch recently. Since they market themselves as the best tacos + margs in AZ, I was super intrigued to try them out. Thank goodness for my friends who get us together to try all these new-to-us places in the Valley!   They're in a cute + festive building in Old Town that is definitely reminiscent of the Wild West. I give them props for that. I left wishing I could give them props to their food + margs... there was a lot desired from them. Perhaps another visit is in order? ::shrug::   The servers were super kind since they had our group to deal with. By the time I arrived mostly everyone had ordered so they went thru the menu, their suggestions with me. I went with the highly-recommended AZ Prickly Pear Marg. It's so pretty! But not that good. I didn't want to bother the servers so I just kind of sipped on it slowly until we left instead of ask for another. I went with a chicken fajita salad too. Really nice presentation in a full fried tortilla bowl, but there's nothing really worth the $13 for it as it's just a standard bland salad with chicken. I wasn't terribly impressed either with their chips and salsa. That's hard to come by for me... but they did.",

    "text": "1 + 1 + 1 = 4  Sometimes, like at Cien Agaves, the sum of the parts adds up to more than each individual part.    Mexican food was on the minds of my party of 4 and the first place we tried claimed an hour-plus wait despite appearing 10% full.  It was a blessing in disguise really, as Cien Agaves was much more what we sought:  a busy casual environment,  inexpensive fare, zero pretension, and no attitude.    During a brief wait at their upstairs bar, we learned it was Happy Hour and that theirs was voted \"best of\" by readers of Phoenix Magazine.  How could it not, with 1/2 price Margaritas, 1/2 off all appetizers, $3-$4 beers, and Tinga Tacos priced at $2.50 apiece?  The fact that it's every day from 3 - 7 p.m. just improves the value proposition.    Margaritas were in demand and many sat pre-made, at the ready.  Large but not refined (and made in advance without salted rims), I really wasn't going to complain loudly about a big $3 cocktail.  It was good enough, a category into which the rest of the offerings could also be said to fall.    At the table, chips and salsa were provided and an order of HH Tinga Tacos proved greasily satisfying.  The rest of the offerings followed suit.  During happy hour it's difficult to resist all those cheap appetizers so I can't really complain about them serving up fatty foods best designed to sop up alcohol.  It is, after all, what I ordered.    Cien Agaves doesn't serve the best Mexican fare but what they do serve - at happy hour in particular - is well priced, good at filling you up, and your server will throw no shade even when your whole party orders from that happy hour menu.  That counts for a lot, thus the new math, where 1+1+1 = 4.",

We were a party of 12 girls and they sat us in their back patio. It was so cute this place had a really great atmosphere perfect for our last night in Scottsdale.  They had an awesome list of margaritas... Half of us got margaritas and the other half shared a pitcher of sangria. BOTH were delicious!  The restaurant was nice enough to give me a free shot of tequila being that we were celebrating my bachelorette party.  You can't go wrong with a burrito. This is definitely a westernized Mexican restaurant if that's what you want then you've come to the right place.   The service was quick, our server was nice and the food was tasty.",

Stumbled upon this place while walking old town Scottsdale for the first time.  Saw a sign that they had happy hour on a Sunday evening, so we decided to stop by.  They were super friendly, even though we had two kids (and let's be honest, kids are messy), and seated us right away.  Their whole restaurant has happy hour, so you don't need to be seated in a particular section to get happy hour pricing, which is great!  We ordered the taquitos, the shrimp ceviche, and the 3 tacos plate, which comes with 3 tacos of your choosing, rice and beans.  Everything was good, and our meal also came with complimentary chips and salsa.  The blended margarita I ordered was refreshing as well.  Loved the super friendly atmosphere of this restaurant and the staff.",

    "text": "This restaurant has AMAZING tacos/food but HORRIBLE service. This disconnect makes it very hard for me to make up my mind about this place. I have been 4 times between mid April and mid June.   PROS: A big variety of tacos, a lot of them are unique and combine great flavors you don't see everywhere else. Love the shrimp and the carnitas/pork. Great chips and Salsa. The margs are really delicious and refreshing also - good portion size and no sugary syrup. Nice atmosphere and patio.   CONS: I have had a different server everytime so it isn't just one person bringing down my review. I feel like the servers have to be reminded of what there job is. It should be automatic to bring by chips and salsa or at least ask if the table wants it. I ALWAYS have to request this. The drinks take a while and often the waitress comes back a second time to double check the drink order. Mainly I feel that they are unattentive and just don't put a lot of effort into customer service which is really too bad because it is a great place.  I am not high maintenance and do not ask a lot, but I do like to be served. Whenever I bring someone new here I always add a disclaimer \"You will love the food, but just as a warning the service isn't great\" so that the person will want to stick around for the course to be served.   I will continue to come here and eat the delicious tacos that I love so much, but will also continue to get extremely annoyed with the staff. This place has amazing potential if they could just work that kink out - it would be perfect.  **UPDATE August 2012 - At the beginning of the month I took some friends here from out of the country. Our food was very good and I am very happy to say that we had great service. I didn't recognize our waitress and I wish I would have gotten her name. She did a great job, was attentive, and was very polite. Made the experience so much better!",

I assume this was their slow time as there was only a handful of patrons and at least 3 or 4 servers and 1 bartender. 3 female servers walked right by me without saying hello or acknowledging me. I hate that.  Makes you feel like they don't want you there. After 5 minutes a gentleman approached and asked if I had been helped. He took a drink order and returned with a menu. Nice guy but he had a dirty broom and dustpan in has hands the whole time....not very appetizing.  A few minutes later, the bartender took my order. I had the Tingo tacos. Tacos were very good as were the chips and salsa. They bring 2 salsas, red and green and both were very good. I really appreciate it when the person taking care of me comes back to see how my food tastes, promptly.  The female bartender did come back to my table but after I was halfway through. If I had had a problem she would have never known it. I asked for a to go box and she brought me one. As I was packing my food in the box I dropped a chip. I didn't feel like getting down at the moment to pick it up and I watched as all of the female servers walked by, more than once and never picked the chip up. Two mail servers did the same thing. There's no way they didn't notice it. It was right in the middle of the walkway and they just stared at it and did nothing. You can always tell when people don't like their job and that's the impression I got from this restaurant. None of the staff smiled at me and none of them seemed like they cared that I was there at all.  It's too bad, the food was very good. When I come to a restaurant I don't expect people to do cartwheels and shoot off fireworks when I come in. However I do expect to be greeted and treated with kindness and a smile. These people all walked around with frowns on their faces and with the attitude that they just didn't care.",

    "text": "3 Stars only because the house margarita and guacamole was so good.  The food was decent (fish tacos), however the patio atmosphere was a bit sad. I understand this is more of a bar than a fine dining restaurant but the patio tables had no place settings, condiments, etc... Just cheap metal tables and chairs. Also - there was no music out there, just this incessant humming of a back alley generator.    The service was a bit sporadic out on the patio as well. We were asked by three different servers if we have a server yet. Not much in the way of organization.   Maybe management just hasn't gotten around to fully organizing and furnishing the patio yet. I hope they do, because they are in a great location and the food and drinks give them lots of potential.",

My boyfriend & I started off with the habanero-lime margarita. Great fresh flavor but we weren't sure where the habanero disappeared to. There was no heat whatsoever. I ordered the 2 taco special--carnitas & shredded beef. Part of my order was wrong, there were only 2 pieces of carnitas, and the shredded beef taco was like a running faucet. My boyfriend ordered the carne asada burrito or should I say the 'rice burrito'...it had nothing but rice & was dry as hell. To top it all off, our waitress never even asked how we enjoyed our meal. Perhaps that was intentional on her part since our entire meal sucked!! Yelpers beware...don't waste your time or your $ on this place!",

After my last review, Katie reached out to me about the issue with my CC and promised to make things right on my next visit. I am not local to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and really had no plans to come back in the immediate future, so I thanked her for reaching out but didn't really expect much to happen.   Fortunately I got the chance to be in Phoenix for a couple days just a short month later and I knew I would be hitting up Cien Agaves for my tinga chicken quesadilla and house margarita. After sitting down and ordering I mentioned Katie and my server sent her right out - she was awesome and very accommodating and made True on her promise.  I can't speak for the full menu because I literally order the same thing every time (I know - how boring,) but I would expect nothing less than greatness from this place.  The only issues I have are: 1.) I can't go on a regular basis 2.) They don't sell the \"green salsa\" - seriously y'all need to allow me to order this or share the recipe with me because I am obsessed with it.   Thanks again Cien Agaves, I can't wait for my next impromptu Phoenix trip so I can come back!",

It did take forever to get chips and salsa but that's the only complaint that I have regarding the actual service at the table..... However, as one of the bartenders checked on us to see if we needed anything else, we ordered another round of drinks and were then informed that they had a private party coming in and they wanted to clear the area within 15 minutes. So, basically, hurry up and get out...   I mentioned the fact that it happened when we first got there and the bartender laughed it off and continued on....

    "text": "Happy hour on Tuesday was better than I expected. I sat upstairs at the high top because it was busy and too hot to sit on the patio. The service from the bartender was awesome considering she was waiting on 4 tables plus the bar by herself and making drinks for the other tables.  The crispy tacos are American style with light & crispy shells (they looked made in-house) with lettuce, tomato, & shredded cheddar cheese. Also comes with cute little flags. I just wished they had more flavor. The margaritas were appropriately strong. And when my boyfriends drink slid off the slanted table, the girls were quick to clean it up, tell is it was ok, and brought a fresh one right away. Needless to say I left a good tip because it was well deserved",

The guacamole has a delicious twist of pomegranate seeds and it goes perfectly with the chips & salsa. The location is great and there is plenty of parking around the restaurant. The service is great and attentive. We are excited to continue to explore more of the menu and we always take friends & family when they are in town! The restaurant has a great vibe and also has outdoor seating for the perfect Arizona weather. We love being able to make reservations when we know we are craving tacos & margaritas and it's very easy to do. This is a just see if you're in old town Scottsdale!",

During happy hour cien-a-ritas are $5...not the best margarita ever but a fantastic deal nonetheless. Last time my boyfriend got his frozen and added coconut flavoring to his ($1 extra) and that was delicious and how I plan on taking mine from now on. They also have half off all appetizers during happy hour!! We enjoyed their guacamole. My favorite food wise was their tinga tacos , which are $3 during happy hour. Overall we spent less than $40 on 4 drinks, 3 appetizers, and 2 tacos. How could you not enjoy that?!",

My rating was lowered because of an issue regarding seating. The hostess told us that there would be a twenty minute wait although there was a nearby empty table in plain site.  The reason given was that two large parties were being served nearby. We went in the bar area to wait but were not allowed to put a third chair at one of the empty two seat tables. We then went to the outside area where we were initially hassled about seating 3 at the table and what could be served outside at that time. Eventually someone was reasonable and allowed us to order both food and drinks. I lowered my rating because of the seating issue.",

Nothing super special but nice smiling faces to come to. The food was something else. I have never had a better taco shell. It was crispy, flavourful, and obviously incredibly fresh. Inside, more impressive flavours. The queso....... just go try it. It's probably the best Tex mex queso I've had.  GREAT experience. Will recommend to friends and come back ASAP.",

In the heat, all I wanted was a tall cool drink, maybe with alcohol. Ended up getting a Cien Agaves margarita for myself, which was quite good. If my girlfreinds drank alcohol , i would have ordered a pitcher they call  El Gigante.  Food was just very bland for me, and very pricey (but it is smack in the middle of a tourist area, so no surprise). ($4.95 for ONE taco - it better be Kobe asada, or Kurobota carnitas and premium Ahi tuna). Maybe that's the Arizona style for Mexican food, but it was not my thing.  Three stars for our very sweet-faced server, it would have gone higher if maybe we got our food and water sooner. Kitchen seemed really slow.",

When we got there we were seated and we waited about 15 minutes for our server to bring back our waters and chips and salsa. She at this time took our order we both got the old town burrito. It took 45 minutes just to get our food and during that time period I think the server came back to check on us once. My buddy said his chicken in his burrito had a rubbery texture. Both our burritos were dry with not much flavor. During this time the waitress came back to see if we needed anything we did not see her after that until we were finished eating. I had looked over and she was busy talking to some people in the bar area which I would assume were her friends. When we finished eating and asked for our check it took her another 20 minutes to bring it to us as she was back in the bar chatting with her friends again. I will sadly not be returning here again if I am in the area.",

The atmosphere is cool, the restaurant's decoration and patio are really neat, they have awesome artwork.   The reason I'm over it is because the service is pretty awful. The chips are stale, but they're free, so I'm not that critical and don't need to fill up on free chips anyway.  Girlfriend digs the margaritas because they don't taste as 'syrupy' (whatever that means) and because they are half price on happy hour. Tinga tacos ($1.50 each) are good too. We really prefer the other tacos they used to have on happy hour like 6 months ago...consider bringing those back, management.  The problem is really that most servers are clueless, irritated that you're in their section and get everything wrong. Pretty consistently, the waitresses seem to be in their first week of their first serving job - forgetting orders, messing stuff up and being awkward.  So if you have a lot of patience, are not in a rush and have a lot of great friends with you, this might be an okay choice for happy hour, but there are definitely a lot of better options nearby.",

The local margarita is made with a locally-made tequila, and this was one of the best margaritas I've ever had. And the tacos? Nom, nom, nom. We had beef, carnitas, and chicken - and they were all winners. The nachos were okay, and the beans and rice were pretty standard fare.  Our server, Meg, was awesome.

Good sangria, interesting patio area (felt more like an alley but cool), great chips and salsa, and good food at a good price.  No one, not even the kid complained about their food.

    "text": "We stumbled upon this place as we were looking for someplace to sit outside.  Being from NE, it seemed all the places in Scottsdale had on the heat--it was 70 degrees and too hot for heat for a NE girl.    We planned on just having a drink but were surprised by the incredible selection of tacos.  We started with the ceviche appetizer which was good.   Chips and salsa was also good, with two salsa selections.  We then had the cheese dip appetizer, which was awesome.  It was definately \"real\" cheese as opposed to some of the other \"cheese\"dips I have had where they are 1% cheese and 99% something else like cheese food.  The taco selection included lobster, shrimp, chicken, pork, salmon.  Quite impressive.  They were all great.    I'm no longer a tequila drinker but their selection is quite impressive and they make their margaritas all fresh with freshly squeezed lime juice.  I did take a sip of one, it was definately a winner!",

Here, the waitress recommended the shrimp and veggie tacos--both were great. And, I could even eat the refried beans (because there was no lard in it)! We all got Cadillac Margaritas and everybody was very pleased with their food. I also appreciated that they were so diligent about the reservation, a party of 8. They gave us a table upstairs that was private and spacious. For someone who doesn't typically consider getting Mexican food, it says a lot that I'm looking forward to going back here in the near future.",

I've been here numerous times, at various times of happy hour, and my sister (who LOVES this place) had her graduation party upstairs.  That was very nice.  Them margs will kick your ass.  Prickly Pear is nice, as is the Cadillac, and the organic marg is a treat as well.  Interior looks like it's off the set of The Peach Pit from Melrose Place in Mexico City.  Outside patio is nice, especially in spring/fall at the fire pit.  No matter what, I always seem to come back.  Waiting to get a glimpse of Tori Spelling lurking in the back...",

I ordered guacamole which was good, not great. Then I got three tacos, two shrimp and one veggie. The menu said the shrimp were hot. I interpreted this to mean spicy. But they were in no way spicy, not even medium. That was disappointing.   My other concern was the outdoor seating. To get a quick seating I agreed to sit outside--they said they had misters and I am really fine with the heat anyway as long as things are shaded. The misters however were pretty extreme. There was a fan blowing a cloud of mist on me the entire time. It was fine at first but got old after a while. Granted I could have requested another seat but I decided to tough it out. But by the end I was honestly a little chilly (yes, in 105 degree weather, amazing to me too).  People who came in after me refused to be seated in the area I was in--they likened it to a rain forest. Note the closer you are to the fan the worse it seems to be.    All in all I was ok with my meal but wonder if I shouldn't have chosen another option in Old Town.",

We want a good Mexican restaurant since we have family coming in from all over the world.  We have not inquired on the cost of renting their second floor, but that aside I would be very happy bringing out-of-towners here for dinner.  Unfortunately I work late, so I cannot partake in their happy hour, but we still wanted to try the place, so we came on a Tuesday at about 9 pm.  I got a house margarita and my fiancee got a strawberry mimosa.  I was very happy with the margarita, it was not overly sweet.  The mimosa on the other hand was not good.  It tasted watery and the strawberry seemed fake.  We let the manager know and he immediately took it off our bill.  We were there for taco Tuesday, so we ordered a bunch of the shredded beef tacos.  They were quite good and much bigger than I was expecting.  All in all it was a very good place, the service was great and the food was great.  We will be back to try a larger selection next time, and hopefully we will be bringing our friends and family here before our wedding!",

I informed the waitress, she appeared to be shocked and had no idea how it got there. She never apologized. I honestly dont think she meant to be rude, she sounded like she wasnt sure how to handle the situation.  I asked for the manager to express my concerns regarding cleanliness of the bar area. He seemed to preoccupied with the dinner rush coming in to address my concerns. He had one foot near my table and the other headed towards the incoming customers.  His lack of interest has most certainly lost my business and I will be sure to recant any positive recommendations I have made to friends, family, and coworkers.",

The quesedillas are good, but they're a bit too greasy, and the chicken is that shreddy texture that I don't really like.    I'd go back but for happy hour only, even though there's only one mixed drink that's half off and only appetizers are half off.",

If I lived here, I would be there every Monday for shrimp tacos (2 bucks!!!) and 6 dollar BEER-A-RITAS - they have taco Tuesdays as well... Both types of shrimp are amazing - one is just grilled shrimp and rice - simple but tasty - and the other is kinda of a fried Asian-y shrimp with cabbage, also killer.   I didn't like their other stuff as much, but still good. The carne asada was steam, just nothing to write home about,. I really liked their crispy chicken taco, and the chorizo and potato taco is a great idea but falls flat because the chorizo is sort of bland - which is strange for a place I found all their food to be sort of spicy.   Came back for lunch our last day before leaving, I will definitely be back! .",

Generally, it's easy to get a good margarita and chips, but the quality of the salsa and food varies drastically from one Mexican place to the next.  I'm happy to say, that despite this being in a touristy part of town, the Yelp reviews are spot on. This place is fantastic with the best salsa I've ever eaten (and I've had hundreds over my lifetime), great chips, awesome food and most importantly fantastic margaritas.  Best of all, the service was fast and friendly so I had zero complaints about this place. Well, I didn't care for the 30 minute wait, but it was worth it as I loved the everything about this place - especially the atmosphere.   I'm so glad I found this place and I'll definitely return the next time I'm in Arizona.",

But like most people I use filters to sort thru new food places that show up on my radar.  Cien Agaves has been one such place. The only reason it has taken me over 30 months to come and eat here has been my perception that this place being in the middle of Old Town is probably a tourist trap. Not really True! After lunching here two days ago, I am convinced of the quality of the food served here.  Also the whole ambiance is great. Fantastic, but funky, art on the walls. Great music.  So I am coming back.  I ordered the Tres Tacos! One each of shredded beef, diablo shrimp and carnitas.  OMG! Great flavor; outstanding texture; optional hot sauce to raise the temperature.  Gracias!",

I ordered a shredded beef taco with no sour cream and my husband ordered a TECATE fish  taco.  We each took one bite asked for the check paid and left.  Oh and my taco came out with sour cream on it.",

We had been to two other bars in old town and were fed up with unpleasant bartenders and bad service but Michael-Anne was awesome and treated us so well! She made us the best strawberry frozen margarita I've ever had and answered my questions! The nachos are on the appetizer list but big enough to split between three people and quite delicious. Would for sure go here again, thanks for ending our night on such a good note!",

    "text": "Comparable to my favorite Mexican restaurant back home, this authentic eatery features a wide selection of traditional favorites and a good selection of beer, cocktails, etc. We were seated outside in an alley way type setting which had a very nice feel to it. Though it was a chilly desert night, they had propane powered, heated lamps keeping guests warm. They also provided free chips and salsa with not one, but two distinct flavors - mild verde and a medium traditional salsa. The chimichanga I had was a new taste for me compared to the same dish I had back at home. The meat was rich and flavorful and not mushed like back home in NJ. Great presentation on it and two different sauces as well (server offer each one or both...both, duh).  My wife had a chicken quesadilla and she enjoyed it as well. We are only spending a weekend in Scottsdale and the restaurants we pick are somewhat of a hit or miss but this was definitely a nice hit. We enjoyed it and didn't find out until later the popularity of this place.   Recommended for any first time visitors to the area and of course the locals too. Good shopping in area as well. Easy access to dessert across the street at the infamous Sugar Bowl of Scottsdale.",

    "text": "Stopped in for a early dinner because this place had good reviews and was right down the street.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the atmosphere was very pleasantly bright and colorful, and the chips and salsa were decent.   Upon first sitting down, our waitress spilled salsa on our table which also splattered lightly on my belongings.  She was very quick and attentive to clean up.  I was also given a dirty napkin that had someone's leftover food pieces in it.  She also very quickly saw that I had a new one when I asked.   I ordered a steak burrito, enchilada style and my boyfriend ordered a shredded beef chimichanga.   My burrito was 95% rice and was very bland. When I did have flavor, it was that of over cooked burned steak. When a couple pieces would fall out of my burrito, they were completely black.   The enchilada sauce tasted like it was out of a can or very terribly seasoned.    My boyfriends chimichanga actually tasted somewhat pleasant. The meat was cooked well. However the chimichanga itself was over fried and the ends were burned. His also contained mostly rice.  I would say based on our experience, you are paying way too much for low quality \"Mexican\" food if you come here.  My burrito was 16 dollars and it contained mostly only rice, which is probably almost no expense to the restaurant.   If you drive down the street a little bit farther to Julio's, you can get a high quality, meat packed burrito at half the cost with soo much more flavor.    I only ended up eating a quarter of the burrito while the rest sadly when to waste.",

The place was maybe 2/3 full, and we were seated right away. Our server was unfortunately lackluster from the start. Only my son was ever brought a water. Two of us ordered alcoholic drinks and one friend ordered a soft drink, and we were never asked about getting refills. The server didn't check on us.  The actual food and drinks, though, were fantastic. They brought us out the standard gratis chips and salsa, and in addition to that we ordered the  queso verde. That was seriously good. Tons of melted cheese, meat, and pleasant spices. I had a strawberry margarita (also fantastic) while my husband had a bottle of beer.  Our server was right in praising the beet salad when I ordered it. The dish was exceptionally good and I've never had the like at any other restaurant. My husband paired two of the appetizer foods, a bowl of green chile pork and the tinga chicken quesadilla. He loved both. I had a sample of the quesadilla and I was impressed by the heavy load of meat. They don't skimp. Our son had a kid's quesadilla and didn't have much, but he's a picky eater. Our friend had the chimichanga, which was huge.  I would be open to coming here again because the kitchen and bar know what's going on.",

Fortunately for me, I have enough sobriety that I was able to breeze past the beckoning of my former friend the agave plant and head straight for the fresh shrimp ceviche with perfectly ripe avocado slices.  The fajita salad did not disappoint, featuring amazingly tender, smoky beef and fresh veggies in an addictively airy tortilla bowl. I ordered the creamy jalapeno dressing, which was a little bit. In retrospect, I would have also ordered the creamy cilantro and mixed the two.  Our server was friendly and appropriately attentive, and we overheard other servers delivering similarly great service.  Only reason for 4 stars was the outdoor dining area was a little plain and dirty, a busboy was smoking outside near the tables, and the inside was overstimulating. But for a tequila bar, maybe those are five-star conditions.",

I ordered the taco combo, one ahi taco which was good however the crispy chicken taco was very bland and tasteless. The rice tasted old and you can tell they put it on the grill to reheat because it had burnt patches ...yuk! Over all I wouldn't spend the $$ to eat here again.",

At $1 each, I order two, with a side of black or refried beans and I'm all set. They serve complimentary chips with two salsas--tomato fresca and spicy tomatillo (my personal favorite). Last night we tried the Street Corn for the first time. It comes topped with a smokey chili blend, crumbled cotija cheese and with the full-husk to use as a handle. It's just a bit spicy, full of flavor and highly recommended (and just fun to eat)! There are also $2 Tecates so you can have a few with your meal and still come out paying only about 10 bucks. Really?? The restaurant is always hoppin' with happy people of all ages. It's well worth the trip, and maybe it will become a Tuesday ritual of yours too!",

Still, two stars because neither my dinner-mate or I actually ordered a lobster taco at all. I knew we were in trouble when the server didn't write anything down and we both had a three taco combo. Talking to said waiter/bartender was impossible because he was in such a hurry and it was so loud anyway. I tried to catch his attention once as he ran by but that didn't work out...  So we ate what we got.  Why were we seated in the bar, you ask? We made a dinner reservation online at Cien Agaves' website but something was wrong with the system that day. Not sure if that was a technical or human fault but whatever. The only option was outside... At the end of June... Or in the bar. I actually saw another couple go spend some time outside and then leave, fanning themselves.  I'd like to try some of the other offerings but that's not likely to happen until it looks like they get their systems sorted out. That includes order taking, reservation taking, and uniform cooking.  Will check back in the future to see what other people have to say.",

We were delighted with the food. We started with the complimentary salsa - the tomato version was ok, but the green chile varietal was excellent and we ordered more - and a generous portion of guacamole.  My wife ordered the tinga taco, which is chicken in chipotle. The chicken was outstanding; I've never had chicken so tender. I had the lobster taco (lobster, fried, and servied with coleslaw) and the carne asada taco, with a hint of lime. Both were delicious.  Service was good and all of the staff were very friendly towards our sleeping baby.   Would definitely go there again. No complaints whatsoever.",

Although our waitress was nice, the service took FOREVER, and the place was not even full at lunch time. $10 for a regular margarita at lunch time seemed a little pricey to me too. We split the 3 taco plate and had a fish taco, lobster taco and carne asada taco. Both the fish and lobster tacos were fried, not lightly fried, but heavily battered and greasy. The carne asada did not have a lot of flavor. Probably OK to go here in a pinch, but there are probably hundreds of places better than this!",

Tip: you may order soft corn tortilla tacos instead of the hardshell for the shredded beef. I preferred the fish taco over all the dishes I tried. In the end, I just picked out the meat and veggies and did not eat the rest of the soggy tortilla.   We also ordered the house margarita. It was very satisfying! As it was a hot day, it did quench the thirst. Other than that, I'd say I would only come back for happy hour or if everything off the menu was half priced",

    "text": "Honest review of the food. BEWARE!  Fellow yelpers you really let me down. I have to assume that the ratings for this place are based on the drinks or pure bribery. I was in AZ so I thought it fitting to have Mexican food. This place had some of the best reviews as far as Mexican places went on yelp and I decided to check it out.  The waitress was very pleasant. and the place was pretty much empty. I showed up around 8:30PM on a Sunday in November.  ATMOSPHERE I give them kudos for the excellent music. A mix of current tunes and some 90s favorites. They also have some great TVs. Temperature wise, even with the door open, it was a tad chilly and I wore my coat. Be it known I mentioned to the hostess when I walked in it was chilly, and after no change, I let her know I was going to get my coat, which also led to no change in the temperature. Glad I had brought it.   FOOD It started out well. I had the chips and salsa (you get green and red) I am a sucker for green salsa, and this did not disappoint. You do need to ask for the chips and salsa if you want them. I'm not the first yelper to mention this. Would be good it the management got the hint and reminded their servers to offer it. I put a little of the red salsa (which is Hot) in with the green to give it a little more zing. The chips were excellent.  Since the Tacos seemed to be all the rave on yelp (maybe because they are $1 on Tuesdays) I got the platter of 2 which comes with rice and beans. Here is what I thought: -Rice - bland, (ok, i know its rice, it wasn't bad rice, just not knocking my socks off. I liked that it was soft and not dry.) -Refried beans- also pretty unexciting, but since they were the most edible thing on my plate much of it was eaten TACOS Part One -Grilled Ono Taco - this fish taco was very dry. even adding salsa/chalula couldn't save it.  I think this taco, with the fish cooked properly could be good. -Carnitas  Taco - This shredded pork taco was insanely greasy and unexciting. One bite was all I could manage. The cilantro and onions were barely discernible accompaniments.  So the waitress comes over and asks how everything is. I take a deep breath and let her know about the tacos. She sweetly asks if she can get me anything else. Still feeling optimistic I go for 2 other tacos that she recommends which are popular ones during their happy hour. She walks away.  A gentleman comes out and explains they are going to make me some replacement tacos and apologizes. I'm not sure who he actually was. No introduction was made. I told him I was optimistic and would definitely give it another shot. Just in the name of full disclosure, the waitress knew I was a yelper. I mentioned it a few times and I was taking photos of all the food she brought out.  TACOS Part Deux In general, so many toppings were piled onto these two replacement tacos I think the chef was honestly trying to mask the mediocrity of the meat. (cheese, lettuce, tomato, sour cream - Taco Bell special) -Shredded Beef Taco -  beef still a little dry, which can be expected. Didn't taste the green chiles it was allegedly marinated in. Unexciting -Tinga taco - this shredded chicken taco was ok. It was marinated in chipotle sauce but was definitely still lacking something.  I have to say there was not an onion in sight within this 2nd round of tacos. I wonder if that's what was missing from the flavor. Lack of seasoning. I can't imagine this is how Southwesterners like this food.   Also, these two replacement tacos (which didn't come out with rice and beans because I said I did not require another serving) came out on a tiny plate. I need to mention that another Yelper has also complained that squeezing two tacos on a small plate is extremely unwieldy. I looked like a little kid spilling tomato and cheese all over the table. Chef - Please just plate the two tacos on a large plate.  I will probably go back one more time and try a few more just to make certain I didn't just have bad luck. It seems some of the other reviewers had tacos which I did not try. If my opinion does change I will make sure to update the review.  $12 with tax/tip. I had a water.",

I get 2 or 3 of them on the side with every salad and that works so well for me. I get to taste a range of amazing flavors, appreciate the talent of their chef, while moderating the amount of extra calories I'm eating.  Another plus? The steak on it is amazing. Lean, pink in the center and tender! I really have to give it to them for producing such an amazing salad. Puts everyone else in PHX to shame.",

Aside from the pretty but grumpy hostess, I have nothing but praise and accolades. The tacos have been amazing each time, the fajitas had that smell that just makes you inhale and savor, and the tequila collection is probably the best I've seen - over 100, mostly high end blancos, repos, anejos and even some of the best (still in production) XAs around. 100 tequilas in a year and you're considered royalty with a picture on the bar and happy hour pricing for life - if you're from Phoenix why aren't you already there? Heck, I only come into town now and then but I'm aiming high. Like I said, the best shelf around.   The servers have been super friendly and attentive, the 'tenders each time have stopped mixing just long enough to say \"hey\" when we walked in. I'm giving the service 4.9 stars (just that hostess that one time...)  Parking is easy, the place is fun. If you haven't come for a tequila pour yet, you're missing out.  \"DJ 1942 neat, please?\"",

When four of us arrived at 4:30pm the hostess told us there was a 15-20 minute wait as we stood in an empty restaurant. They told us the kitchen was backed up and they couldn't seat any more people. We were fine with that and just wanted to sit down and enjoy a couple drinks. After some back and fourth one of them reluctantly took us to the island just past the bar threw down our menus and left. We could hear them griping about the situation from our table. It was just such a strange and awkward encounter I had a hard time enjoying my meal. After this however we had great service from our server and the food was delicious and incredibly fast considering the kitchen was backed up when we walked in. My favorite from the meal was the guacamole with pomegranate seeds on top. I would love to give this place another try in the future.",

My husband and I were excited to enjoy a well-crafted margarita with some upscale tacos, and we left satisfied with our experience. Yet, when my husband wound up with an awful bout of food poisoning that kept him in bed for the entire next day, we instantly regretted our experience.  Being on vacation, this wound up costing us expensive tickets to two spring training games and time with our friends that we hadn't seen in years. When I called the restaurant to alert them of the issue in their kitchen, the manager was rude and accusatorial.   The manager said it was impossible that the food poisoning came from them, because it takes 24 hours for food poisoning to occur. When I mentioned that the Mayo Clinic disagrees and that it only takes hours, she went as far as arguing the Mayo Clinic's research.  She said that the restaurant requires customers to get a doctor's note verifying that the food poisoning came from their food. Well, since it was 7:00 on a Friday night and we were trying to salvage what was left of our shortened vacation, we weren't trying to pay $500 for an unnecessary ER visit.   Food poisoning is bad, yet Cien Agaves' customer service is worse.",

The salsa was amazing!!!  It was so good, my whole family liked it, we polished off the basket in no time.  I ordered the chicken fajita bowl, it was really good and inexpensive, only $9.  The rice especially was delish, authentic with a bit of kick.  The kids burritos were a good size for the price and milk for them was only $1.  All and all a great stop for dinner.  Kid friendly but still adult and fun atmosphere, good food and good service.  They also had TVs everywhere, so we were able to watch basketball.  Great location and in an easy to walk area.

These are without a doubt the most flavorful tacos I've ever had. It's like a taste explosion! I think some of that comes from the fresh guacamole they put on the tacos.

We went during the afternoon, and it had a very laid back vibe, which I really enjoyed. I only had a beer and some tacos (which were AMAZING!) so my overall experience was somewhat limited. But in the short time i spent there I was definitely impressed, and will be back very soon.",

    "text": "This place is a True hidden gem in Scottsdale!! I have dinner here probably once if not twice a week! The grilled Ono fish tacos are my all time favorite! I get the dinner which comes with 2 fish tacos, rice and beans. Not only are the tacos amazing but the rice is one of the best I've ever had! I wish they would bottle and sell their salsa verde as I've never had better. The price is def. reasonable especially for the generous amounts of food they give you not to mention the yummy chips & salsa you get when you first sit down.  You can't go wrong with any of the wait staff as they all are amazing & super friendly! I've never had a waitress/waiter that I didn't like! I will have to say that Shelby, Niki, Heidi & Kaitlyn are extremely awesome waitresses as I usually have one of them when I come in. The service is always great, the food comes out quick & I have to say I absolutely love the decor of the restaurant!!  If you're looking for a casual fun Mexican place to eat with a friendly staff and awesome food this is def. the place to go. The menu has several choices & they always have happy hour specials.  I am def. a customer for life & would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone! Anyone I've ever brought here for the first time has always come back..:)  Thanks Cien Agaves for having such a great wait staff & serving such amazing food always!",

    "text": "Visiting from New York we wanted something 'authentic' to Arizona while walking around Old Town Scottsdale and this place seemed to fit the bill.  I ordered the Fajita Bowl.  On 'paper' it didn't seem like anything amazing - rice, beans, citrus marinade grilled veggies and guacamole on top - but it was vegetarian and seemed filling so I went for it.  This is an example of where a humble meal, prepared well, ends up besting something else that's got a sexier name or more exotic ingredients.  It was perfectly seasoned, with just enough 'heat', everything tasted fresh, the rice and black beans were soft, the grilled veggies REALLY did have a marvelous citrusy lemon-lime flavor and the guac provided a lovely counterbalance to the heat of the dish.  Healthy, tasty,with a texture that was both chewy and soft.  Perfect and at $7, it seemed like the best deal in town.  You can order it with some protein on top for a bit more too.  The services was friendly and atmosphere very SouthWestern.  If I was local, this would become a regular thing.",

We started with the margaritas and I have to say they were about the best I've ever had. Definitely enjoyed the cucumber one, very refreshing! For those who can tolerate spicy, I also loved the Habanero margarita. For an appetizer don't miss the cerviche. All the food was delicious and good size portions. Leave room for dessert because the flan was the best I've ever had.  Service was personable and attentive while laid back. This place is a definite thumbs up!",

The crispy corn shell was the best I've ever had. We put on a little chalula sauce and it was perfection.  The margaritas are pretty good too. I like how they make the sweet and sour mix and use fresh lime juice.  We sat outside and we really enjoyed the atmosphere, laid back and casual. We had our dog with us and it was a good time.  Only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 is because the waiter knew it was our first time there and he didn't ask us if we wanted the complimentary chips and salsa. I only found out after coming on yelp that we had to ask for it.",

In many cases they are only places to get drunk or they are super gimmicky.   Cien Agaves had perfect food and drinks while staying reasonably priced.   We were there for happy hour and sat up at the bar. The bartender was completely cool.   I had the tostadas which was an enormous serving and a potato cheese taco. Tostadas were loaded with beans, cheese, lettuce, cabbage and I topped it off with their delicious salsa. When I had their potato taco I thought I had died and went to heaven. My husband had the ceviche and tinga tacos, which he said was excellent.  Their house margarita was on special for happy hour... I'm usually weary of house margaritas. They are either too sweet or not strong enough. But these were great!  We will definitely be back! I want to try their veggie tacos....",

Usually I sit at the bar, but I recently had the pleasure of being served by Mimi when out with some friends. Mimi was especially courteous, checking up on us many times to make sure we were all set. She had a great sense of humor, too. 5 Stars for Mimi!!  The happy hour deals are decent. Personally, I think it should be extended to more than just the house margarita.  As a tip, the avocado margartia is to die for! It sounds weird, but it's creamy and delicious. I think it milds the flavor of the margarita a bit, which is nice.",

The birthday boy made a reservation for 8pm, and when we arrived fashionably late (thanks to my husband), the rest of our group (approximately 15 people) were already seated, eating chips and salsa, and drinking margaritas.  We caught up pretty quickly thanks to Lindsay, our waitress - I had a margarita made with Vodka and J went with a beer.    The food was decent.  I think the 3.5 star average is right on... I split shrimp fajitas with J and shared in the guacamole, nachos, and a few other apps that the table had.  The guys that ordered the special ahi tacos really enjoyed them.    I have yet to try the ceviche and I may even go for the tequila margarita next visit, but I'd for sure return to Cien Agaves in the future.  Two drinks was all I needed and I was done for the night.

Both their red sauce and their tomato sauce, as well as both salsa, both beans and their rice, are all 100% vegetarian. That's incredibly hard to find here in Arizona.  I love the basics; the cheese enchiladas are what bring me back. I've deviated twice; once for the fajitas, and once for the chilie relleno.  Both were ok, but nothing to write home about. My partner devours the chimichanga, and says it's one of the best she's had. Oddly enough, neither of us have tried the tacos, which is what they're known for. Perhaps next time!",

We went upstairs to the bar area, where two elongated utility tables were out. There were two representatives offering (approximately) two ounce shots in small, plastic \"sauce\" cups. Which, by the way, we never did experience.  We gave up and left after waiting (standing) in line for fifteen minutes. It was more aligned with a keg party.  Not that we were upset, since instead of a sipping and a True tequila experience, we were really in the middle of a \"free shot\" until you get really, really drunk experience.  We left and headed over to the grapevine instead. Excellent patio, decent cocktails, (unfortunately a poor tequila selection, but that's not what they are known for).   I do have to say, the manager was kind in an email, but we won't be visiting here again.  I can't comment on the food. 1 star for misrepresenting what they are offering, 4 stars for management. 5 stars to Google Offers for giving me a full refund without any issues.",

The rest of us came over in huge groups from the dinner and the staff was ready for us.  Upstairs, we had two bartenders and the manager informed me that she had chips and salsa out for everyone to snack on...even though we just ate, everyone appreciated the thought and they were gobbled up! The bartenders were bad ass! They handled the massive wave of people like pros and had smiles on their faces the whole time. Thank you guys so much for doing such a great job with our party!  I had actually been here 3 years ago when I first moved and remember really enjoying the food as well, but the decor and service is what reminded me of how great this place is both for just hanging out and having a huge get together. I would highly recommend the top floor for a group like ours as long as you plan ahead and coordinate with their team because they are happy to accommodate and I would recommend stopping in even for a drink since they have some killer margaritas!",

    "text": "Me and a group of 9 friends decided to come check this place out before our movie! It took about 10 minutes to get our drinks that we were never ID'd for after ordering and our waitress mixed all of our margaritas up. I didn't catch her name as she never introduced herself. It was a young black girl serving upstairs. By the time the food came out some of us were missing tacos, shrimp, sides, etc and all of our waters were empty!! We asked the bartender to grab us water and he did promptly.  the food was absolutely delicious!! I was very impressed. I wish we had more time to enjoy but the service was so slow that we were late for the movie.  Our server was standing at the POS for 10-15 minutes trying to get our checks but my friends grew so frustrated that they lined up in efforts to pay so she would stop getting distracted. I then watched her whisper to the bartender how \"annoying\" we were. What's really annoying is having poor service ruin an entire meal that was so promising. Keep up the good work, chefs!",

The food has NEVER let me down. One of the owners is usually on site and you can tell they care about their product. I have recommended this place to numerous out of town friends, and they have always enjoyed the experience.   They have an upstairs area that you can rent out for special events. The atmosphere is perfect for larger parties and fun occasions like graduation parties, work events, wedding showers, etc.  We have rented the space and utilized their catering menu a few times and they have always been very helpful with each event. Very accommodating! Warm staff! You will not be disappointed.",

Located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, it's near all of the Western Shops and knicknack stores....a great place to grab a bite if you're walking around and doing some shopping.  Highlight of some items we've ordered here:  Los Nachos (Chips, Black Beans, Cheese, Pico de Gallo, Jalapenos, Crema Mexicana, Grilled Chicken), $9.95 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ja4stXdNYr39u5CZHMNtjw?select=O-yvBcKbgwf9Do-vpgr5xQ#O-yvBcKbgwf9Do-vpgr5xQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Ja4s...</a>  Chicken Tortilla Soup (Bowl), $5.50  Steak Fajitas, $15.95  3 Taco Special (any 3 Tacos), $12.95 I've ordered this several times.  Some of the Tacos I've tried are: - Taco al Pastor - Shredded Beef Taco - Carne Asada Taco - Carnitas Taco - Pollo Asado Taco  My 2 favs on that list are the Carne Asada & the Taco al Pastor Tacos.  Overall, the food is pretty good and the Margaritas are excellent.  We've only come here during lunchtime and the service is so/so.  Sometimes we get an experienced server and they're good.  Other times we get a young, inexperienced college student that has no clue and forgets to serve us our complimentary Chips & Salsa....that's happened on 2 visits.  The inconsistent service is what knocks them down from a 4 to a 3 Star for me.  Return Factor - 60%",

    "text": "I don't know about you, but the one person I would trust most in the field of tacos would be a luchador. If a Mexican wrestler can vouch for an establishments tacos, then really, they've just got to be good. And due to the number of luchador paintings in Cien Agaves, I think it's just a fact that these are some of the most delicious tacos in Old Scottsdale.  These wee little tacos can be ordered a la carte, or in a combo of 2 or 3 plus rice and beans. Go for three. Sure, two would fill you up, but why would you waste an opportunity to try yet another variety of taco? THAT would be ridiculous. I opted for an all seafood night, chowing down on a beer battered ono taco, the island shrimp taco (served with an awesome tangy and sweet sauce), and an ahi tuna taco. The first two were glorious, some of the best i'd ever had. They weren't huge, but they were stuffed liberally. This is especially True of the plump shrimp, which didn't taste remotely Mexican to me, but were delicious nonetheless. I unfortunately didn't care for the ahi tacos, and I love ahi tuna. They weren't bad, just very average. And average looks bad when next to glory.   OH and did I mention habanero-lime margaritas? Sure they have plenty of different, unique flavors (hibiscus, blood-orange, prickly pear, cucumber) but that habero-lime is the perfect mix of refreshing and a kick. I would have had a dozen, if they'd had let me.   Who knows when I'll be back in Scottsdale, but when I am, I'll be sure to chow down at Cien Agaves. And maybe even steal one of those luchador paintings!",

There was a 30 minute wait since we didn't have a reservation, but we decided to sit in the bar instead. At first the service was a little slow, but as dinner went on it was much better.   We both just ordered soda, so I cannot comment on the margaritas, but the bartender was cranking them out and they all looked delicious! Such a variety of tequila and drinks on their menu.   We started with the guacamole which was very fresh and topped with pomegranate seeds. It's the perfect combination! Their salsas were a little too watery, but good flavor.   There were so many things on the menu that we wanted to try, but decided on the Steak Burrito with refried beans and the Combo #5. The burrito was huge and covered with red enchilada sauce. The steak was cooked well and the beans were definitely homemade which is a huge plus for me. The Combo #5 was a Tinga taco, cheese enchilada, beans and rice. Everything was a hit!  Will definitely return to try some of the tacos and the happy hour which is every day from 3-7pm!",

I had a super hard time deciding on which 3 to choose as they all sounded better than the last. I finally decided on a carne asada, pollo asado, and the tecate fish taco. The fish was by far my fave with the carne asada a close second. The waitress was friendly, attentive and helpful in giving me the low down on the tacos. Next time I will order al la carte since there was waaaaay too much food for me to eat.

Our servers took such great care of our big table on monday night, that I have to give the place 5 stars before even one plate of food was served.  About the food we planned the visit around Cien Agaves terrific Happy hour, so there were lots of tico tacos $1.50 ea and half price appitizers on the table, rounded out by a few entrees. Everything I tasted was delicious, especially the Chicken Quesidilla. Normally I would skip a chicken Quesidill on almost any menu, but I am so glad I didnt this time. Just the right mix of seasoned Chipotle Chicken and Cheese in a huge folded and grilled tortilla, with sour cream. This is by far the very best restaurant quesidilla in town. Everything served was great, and raves about the food came frome everyone.  They have great drink specials during happy hour as well, including 1/2 price margaritas and special priced beers. It's the tequilla selection that is special though. It's an amazing selection of some of the best tequillas in the world. You can even try some tequilla flights!  Inside the place is funky/cool, super clean, with some really cool art and lighting. In Old Town There are some real GEMS and a few DUDS when it comes to mexican food, but Cien Agaves might just be the very best choice for Mexican food in Scottsdale.  I MUST SAY TO MY FELLOW YELPERS---GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

We saw it's reviews, and decided to give it a shot.  It was busy downstairs, and but slow upstairs where we were. At first we had trouble getting water refills and chip refills, but I'll give it to the servers, it got packed quick upstairs (I think the Giant's spring training game got rained out). They eventually took a good chunk off of our bill, which was cool.  As far as food goes, we all ordered the different taco assortments. Mine were fantastic! A shredded beef taco, carne asada, and a fish. It was the perfect amount of food. We were all happy with our food.  Although this place is a tad on the divy side (no problem to me...dives are not necessarily bad), the food was great! I'd like to try some of their tequilas some day....I'll be back.",

Hottie and I decided to take a seat on the patio during Sunday happy hour to enjoy the Arizona sunshine.  We weren't planning on eating, but after seeing the food being served we decided to give their tacos and some guacamole a try.  I had a veggie taco on a flour tortilla.  It was excellent; they actually grilled up the veggies and the tortilla, giving it the nice crunch of a taco without the frying.  The guacamole was just okay; I've had better and can definitely make a better batch at home.   A good Mexican food restaurant typically has a solid chips and salsa presentation, but their salsa was weak and had gringo written all over it! I'm glad I ended up ordering a taco, because it gave me a better peek into their menu.  We will definitely be back for Happy hour; you can't get a rockin' $3.50 margarita and $2 taco anywhere else in Old Town!",

No, it's not \"quiet\" like your typical Scottsdale restaurant but I don't think it's meant to be. It's more like a restaurant/bar/cantina kind of place. Fun.

Go quickly though, we made sure the local ABC office received the video of the over-serving.",

We stepped in to this vividly colored restaurant thinking it would be touristy and the food would be just meh. I hate syrupy sweet margaritas that taste more like a Otter pop and less like a adult drink. These people take margaritas seriously!! It was obvious that other people felt the same because they were all posing with their drinks in their hands for selfies, and big grins on their faces. They had three pages of different margaritas all hand squeezed. My husband had their beerarita that was smooth and not overly sweet. I ask the waiter if they could make me a grapefruit margarita, and  he pointed out a fantastic one that didn't have added syrup or sweet and sour in it but very stiff. The perfect drink to cool you down. After a drink and a appetizer of the Chile verda with queso we decided to try some of their street tacos and their roasted beat with chimchurri salad. Wow! I found my self dissecting the salad trying to figure what all was in the mixture so I could make this at home. Needless to say this will be our new date night/happy hour stop when we are in Old Town Scottsdale.",

    "text": "Wife and I tried Cien Agaves for lunch. We do not recommend them in anyway.  My wife tried the trio of tacos: tinga chicken, carna asada and el pollo asada. I had the Combo # 5.  We were in midweek at 11:30 am. Restaurant was not busy. Two guys eating lunch at the bar and three small tables in the restaurant.  We sat in the bar at a table. A server was cutting was cutting limes at the bar.  Service was slow. Chips were flat tasting and unsalted. Refried beans were runny. Mexican rice was bland.   My cheese enchilada and beef taco were good. My wife enjoyed the tinga taco. The meat in the other two tacos tasted burnt. The meat wasn't burnt but tasted like it had been cooked on a grill where something had burnt and they cooked her meat on the same surface.   My wife saw the server in the ladies room place her hands on the wall and then go back to cutting fruit without washing her hands. The bartender repeatedly rubbed his nose with his hands and went back to making drinks.",

For $19, this is what my friend and I got: A margarita, a dos equis, nachos, and a quesadilla.  The nachos were huge and they used real cheddar cheese (not the soupy sauce).  The quesadilla was equally large, and tasted great.  Their complimentary chips and salsa had a great salsa verde, although I didn't much care for the red salsa.  Service was outstanding.  Non happy hour prices were on par with other Mexican joints, but I rarely see too much on happy hour at other Mexican restaurants.    I will definitely be back when I can get off work and make it down here before 7!",

I'm pretty picky about Mexican food and really enjoyed the whole experience here. We stopped in on Monday night when the house margarita was half off and tacos were 2.50. I got a margarita and two tacos for 9.00!  It's also located in old town Scottsdale which is a fun area to check out. If you are looking for a more casual, comfortable spot in Scottsdale, stop here.",

I had friends in town and they wanted good authentic Mexican so I decided to take them here for a guaranteed great meal but we were all very disappointed.    The atmosphere is pretty good, casual always busy but they seat you pretty quickly. I wasn't super hungry so decided to just pick from everyone else plate.  The table had an assortment of dishes...tacos, tostadas, burritos, beans & rice but nothing was that great. However the guacamole is some of the best that I've ever had.  I was very disappointed that I didn't deliver great authentic Mexican for my friends on their last night in Phoenix.   Based on some other reviews I guess this place is hit or miss.  I'll try again on a taco Tuesday when they have specials and hope it's a HIT. I've had better Mexican from local taco trucks so wouldn't feel the need to come here.  It wasn't horrible just a disappointment.",

The margarita was still pretty solid just taco was completely dry. Staff was not very good in checking on guests although you would expect it when your seating at the bar.

We enjoyed the lights outside and walked around after our meal was done. The patio is dog friendly as well :) Highly recommend this place. They have two locations but this one is by far the best one.

Among the 5 of us, we had: fajita salad (me), green chile cheese crisp, chicken fajitas, shredded beef taco, and a taco combo meal. For beverages, the cien-a-rita house margarita (me), blackberry mojito, habanero+lime rita, and pom-berry. The menu claims the house marg is the best in town, so obviously I had to try it! Everyone was very happy with their meals and even happier with the drinks.   Service was friendly, and the complimentary chips and two salsas were perfect while waiting for our orders. Unfortunately, my salad arrived with chicken, though I ordered it with veggies only (or you can also get grilled steak, salmon, or shrimp for a few extra dollars). However, after bringing it to the server's attention, he was fast to apologize and bring back a new veggie-only salad very quickly from the kitchen. I loved that it was loaded with black beans and corn, not just a mound of lettuce and tomatoes like many places. Also, the creamy cilantro dressing was awesome, and I also tried the roasted tomato chipotle pepper vinaigrette (extra 50).  We all left very pleased with our meals, and I only wish I'd be around to come back for happy hour!",

    "text": "When in Scottsdale I crave Mexican, and Cien Agaves is - surprisingly - one of the few Mexican places that popped up in the immediate area of Old Town. I was looking for a quick to-go option and they delivered my meal in a hurry despite it being more of a sit-down establishment. The meat of my review comes down to the burrito, which was pretty underwhelming considering the size, lack of ingredients and fact that I paid $18 for it when you throw in tip and the additional charge for red sauce.   The burrito is supposed to be a \"giant\" flour tortilla filled with a combo of rice, cheese, pico de gallo and meat. Black beans and guac, which are usually included in such a creation, come on the side in small containers. The burrito was smaller than what I'd usually get at a place like Chipotle and essentially all meat and rice. The rice was a little undercooked as well. It was only after I returned to my hotel that I discovered there was next to no cheese or pico.   I think it comes down to burritos just not being their thing. After all, there was only one burrito option on the menu. I will say the bartender was sweet and chatty and made things fun during my short wait.",

We finally gave up on maps and walked through the rain and found it on our own.  We were seated near the bar, and the friendly bartender came out to take our order. We ordered guac and chips. As a special touch, the guac had pomegranates seeds   It really added a nice touch.  I told her I wanted enchiladas, but I could not have cheese , milk or butter.  She said she would order mine ala carte, since their rice had butter & I didnt want beans.  My wife had a taco with potato, queso, and chili.  Everything was delicious.  Shout out to the bartender who doubled as a server while keeping the bar moving",

We weren't sure where we were going to eat, but we had a pretty good idea we should eat in the vicinity before anyone got hangry.  :-)     While shopping at an area jewelry store she solicited their suggestions.   Without hesitation the sales clerks recommended CIen Agaves as their first choice.     The atmosphere was casual and comfy.  The food was top notch.   The chips and salsa was great.  (We both thought the mild salsa was a bit oily.  The spicier red salsa was not too spicy in my estimation.)    My wife had the hard shell chicken taco and I had the soft shell pork taco meal.  We both enjoyed our meals.  The shells were tasty with a good texture.  The rice didn't do much for me...but the refried beans were good in both taste and quantity.    We will be back!",

    "text": "Loved it! The best part? Their hours! My family took so long trying to figure out where to go on a weeknight for tacos that the majority of places were closed. So Cien Agaves it was! Even better that it was Margarita Monday! They're open until 11pm or midnight depending on the day.   Their chips come with two salsas - a mild and medium (at least according to my tastebuds) which is something I always appreciate. Still, I was \"that guy\" who asked if they had something hotter so they brought out a third salsa which appropriately tickled my tastebuds.   We started with the cheese crisp which was pretty darn good. The only problem was there wasn't much room for it on the table given the plethora of salsa bowls and margaritas. Quite tasty and a good choice to share and split with anyone, even the picky eaters.   I had the tacos (duh!) They have something like 12 different varieties - you can get one (a la carte), two or three and mix it up. I chose the Tecate fish, tinga, and carne asada. I couldn't possibly eat them all but I wanted to go all out since we don't have places like this on the East Coast (some people try and most of them epically fail). My favorite was the Tecate fish but you can't go wrong with the tinga. It's a good all around taco. As for the carne asada, it had more guac than carne, but still it was good.   The cherry on top and what gave them a full five stars was their decor and music. Social D was on which is always a plus in my book. I'll be sure to come back next time I'm in town!",

It was 10 PM by the time we got there and the kitchen was closing up but they stayed open long enough to serve what may be the best chimichanga I've ever had.  It was carnitas served in a nice flaky tortilla shell, just absolutely delicious.  My wife's beef enchilada's were tasty as well and she especially raved about the rice and black beans.  By the time we finished the place was empty, (Scottsdale in summer is a little warm) but we never felt rushed, the server treated us as if he had all night.   Will definitely be back.",

Four of us cousins went out to celebrate a birthday. We made a reservation and were seated just fine. It took about 15 minutes for anyone to come ask for our drink orders. We ordered and then waited literally an hour for our food. We were told they were backed up in the kitchen so we weren't freaking out too much... However, my cousin and I both ordered the Ahi Poke Bowl, and they were BOTH brought out with hard rice that had barely been cooked. Apparently the whole batch had been undercooked and no one had noticed before sending it out. We kept having to flag people down because all of the servers were frantically moving about the restaurant. We expected to have been compensated in some way, but NOTHING was taken off of the bill. It was ridiculous. The only saving grace was that our waiter was nice and tried his best to make up for the kitchen staff being behind. But for a restaurant old town Scottsdale I was NOT impressed. I will definitely not be going back.",

Ambience - ok  Service - meh Margarita - meh Food - meh Price- ok, but for bad quality they offer it's high  We had a bad waitress, I think her name was naomi, never introduced herself, found it on the check, which was the only time she actually smiled, bcs ofc she needs tips, but for what? She never made me feel welcome, didn't make my day any better, screwed up my order & never spent an extra second with me? In fact towards the end I asked the helper boy for everything and gave him a few $ tip.   I got a cucumber margarita after reading recommendations, which was just meh. Probably would hav been better if frozen. The price doesn't justify it. Macayos or ze tejas has Better ones.  I am a vegetarian, so decided to get veggie fajitas with black beans and corn tortillas. Fajitas were so bland and had no flavor whatsoever. I could stir fry these veggies in my home to taste better. Even a sports bar like Gallaghers has better fajitas than here. Black beans was a disaster, it was just cooked bland beans, no flavor, no salt, nothing at all. Is this supposed to b a joke, or they don't care much about vegetarians? Bcs my gf loves her meat tacos. I am defntly hoping to hear from the owner/manager about this!!   And ofc the corn tortillas never arrived, instead came the flour tortillas, down went my calorie count. Thanks cien agaves, not sure why u r trying to copy tortilla factory? Not coming back soon, unless forced to!!  Check the posted pics along with review",

Service is usually good, I'd say 90% of the time it's great.    What can I really complain about?  Well, the floor is a little difficult to navigate in heels; it always seems slippery for some reason. (I'm actually surprised I haven't fallen down  yet.)  And the bathrooms.....they have black fixtures.  I know it's weird, but black bathroom fixtures give me the heebies.  Neither one is enough to keep me from returning on a regular basis.    I've been hesitant to write this review, only because I don't want to see you all there taking up my space and making me wait for a table.  I'm an impatient girl when it comes to my tequila.  ;)",

They seated us on their great shaded patio, which gave the kids a little room to be kids, had a cool breeze, and kept us out of the sun.  We ordered a few different appetizers to split between three adults: guacamole, queso verde, a delicious creamy poblano soup, and the green chili cheese crisp.  Everything was delicious and the portions were huge.  I'm used to getting a relatively small bowl of guac or queso at most restaurants, not here.  We had leftovers of everything and were all stuffed. Our waiter was super nice, gave great recommendations, was patient with our kids, and helped make it a great experience.",

I travel for a living and make it a point to find taco stands, taco trucks, or anything taco related wherever I go.    I was disappointed here.  I read several reviews about the service been so-so to lousy, and that was my experience today.  The hostess was slow to recognize me when I walked up, took some menus and said she would be right back. She did not say hi or welcome me, just turned around and left.  I went to go sit at the bar and was also slow to be recognized as far as a greeting.  I also had to ask for chips and salsa just like several other yelpers have complained about, because I sat there for five minutes after ordering my tacos, and I still didn't have chips or salsa.    I ordered the tacos al pastor and ahi tuna combo with rice and beans.  There was plenty of tuna on the one taco, but the taco Al Pastor was the smallest most pathetic taco I think I have ever seen.  I think it had more pineapple than pork.   In fact I'm not even sure there was any meat in it.  Way less tasty than they should have been.    As for the chips and salsa, the chips were stout, not the flimsy kind and were good enough.  The salsa was thin and runny but the green and red both had good flavor.  Sad to say, then chips and salsa were the best part.",

Not only was the taste perfect but they didn't wimp out on the tequila. The color was spot on.   3. The carne asada taco. One word, delicious. I think this might be the best taco is the valley. Everywhere I go I try their carne asada taco, and this place was by far the best. I am just unhappy it took me this long to find Cien!!!  I will return.",

I went to Cien Agaves for the second time, the very next day, because this place is so good!  Coming from Upstate NY, I put all my hopes for a good mexican meal during my short trip to AZ in this place. It is loud in here, with the latest top 40 music playing throughout its two floors. There is an outside patio where you can eat tacos outside enjoying the desert air and a $2 taco tuesday.  The shredded beef tacos were completely addicting and I loved that they dotted the guacamole with little pomegranate seeds (so much healthier!). The tortillas were those homemade corn tortillas that you yearn for in the Eastern states. For my friend's rehearsal dinner, they made mini churros that they turned into a fine display. I'm a sucker for mini churros.  This place is great for a quick mexican platter while passing through Scottsdale. If you are interested in using it for a party, it was definitely one of the best mexican buffet style experiences that I have ever tried. I would definitely come back during my next visit.",

I was really excited because I love good tequila and they had an awesome bar. I opted to sit at a bar table. They offered a drink menu, I advised that I didn't need a drink menu- I am a sipper- I immediately ordered the Clase Azul, and the Ambrosso Anejo, which I could see from my seat. I never got it. My hiking buddy went to the bar tender to ask questions because she is not a drinker and wanted some tall margarita drink because the class looked cool. ....well.... (I am still waiting on my Tequila- how long does it take to pour it neat?)  she and the Manager had  some not so friendly words about her asking him questions and not walking away after she got the answer because we had a waiter who was not present at the time. This behavior was not good toward a consumer. We get to choose where to spend our money. We opted for a more friendly place-hole in the Wall- home made excellent food. It is right behind Tony's leather shop by Aveda.",

We were taken up stairs to a 4 top. As we were being seated the hostess informed us there was a reservation for our table in 1-1/2 hours \"Would that be enough time?\" Uummm....that will depend on your service!! We've never been here....Just Wow!! She should've just said \"Heads up ladies, in an hour and a half we're going to be asking you to leave this table.\" It really put a bad taste in our mouth from minute one. The food was good, the drinks were OK,  but the policy of informing guest that they're going to have to leave in a certain timeframe doesn't sit well with most people. It didn't with us. So if you decide to dine here, make a reservation....",

Quite frankly, we were all shocked at how high the reviews were since we were disappointed in almost everything.  The happy hour rock margaritas were probably the best thing we ordered. The prickly pear margarita was just super sweet and none of us wanted it. For our appetizer, we got the green chile cheese crisp, which was okay, but could have used a lot more toppings and it was mostly just crispy tortilla. The three of us ordered tacos: Tinga chicken (I liked this one, but the others didn't); pollo asado (boring); fish (okay); and pappas con queso (the saddest of the bunch). And the beans and rice also went untouched as they were both very plain and dry.   Also, our server never cleared anything from our table. Fortunately there were 3 of us at a 4 top so we were able to stack things in one spot, but she routinely left our table empty handed. Even a busser came by, took a couple plates, then never came back for the rest. We had appetizer plates still at our table while finishing dinner.  This was our last dinner in Scottsdale and super disappointing.",

We were a party of five and none of us were super impressed. The restaurant is also super loud with people talking and loud music (we couldn't even hear the music it was just more noise).. we did visit on a Tuesday? Our waitress didn't check on us after our food came (drinks were often empty), we weren't able to order more drinks, and the people seated behind us ended up leaving, because the waitress never returned. If the food was terrific, I'd not have minded the rest, but it's just not.",

For anyone going out to eat, if you walk in and the place is empty just walk right out. It's that way for a reason! I don't have enough characters to go into detail about everything wrong with this experience!  For my grading scale, if I can't find ANYTHING good to say that's a one star. This place squeaked out 2 stars because the queso was awesome and I did love the salsa as well! But this is a 1.2 star restaurant at best!  My buddies burrito came with 2 rips in it and it was dry. My tacos were dry and didn't automatically come with a sauce. We ordered the nicest tequila and they ran out. Our waitress was terrible. Didn't care at all honestly. No one enjoyed the food and we left pissed.  This place is hyped up because its close to old town, but when you have an experience like this, and another friend says he hated it too, you know its not good! Find another Mexican place like DIEGO POPS!!",

The old building is colorful and inviting with a bustle of people coming and going.  We chose to sit outside on the patio.  Service was fast and friendly.  We started with drinks and some appetizers.  I chose the habanero margarita, my friends had the Pom margarita and coconut frozen margarita.  For appetizers, we had chips with 3 different salsas, fresh guacamole, and green chili queso dip.  My margarita was refreshing and finished with a nice spice.  I didn't try the Pom, but the coconut was delicious as well.  The homemade chips were wonderful and thick enough to scoop up our dips.  All of the dips were perfectly delicious.  Three of us ordered the 2 taco combo with our choice of tacos (carne asada, brisket, ground beef, pork, fish, shrimp,...).  There is also an option for 3.  Our other friend opted for a huge burrito.   All food was very good and was delivered timely.  Very reasonably priced and a great lunch stop.  This will definitely be on my list of places to visit again.",

The wait was an hour and 15 minutes which held to be True. Once we were finally seated around 6:15 we had a little bit left to order before the happy hour ended at 6:30pm.  Our waiter finally came and left about as quickly. He was rude and constantly seemed annoyed. We were warned up front that the kitchen was behind and it would take longer for our food. I asked if he recommended tacos or fajita bowl and his response was \"either.\" Then I asked how hot the shrimp tacos were and he said \"depends on your tolerance.\" I was so displeased with the service. Ended up with what I thought would be a safe choice of tacos and they were ok.  Also, ordered the happy hour special of a tinga taco and got charged full price. If you have the option -- GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Overcharged and underdelivered.",

We walked in at 7:30 and it's quite the stimulating atmosphere. An hour long wait for a table, or seat yourself at the bar. With that demand, I was eagerly awaiting the amazing food that warranted such a wait. There is two floors, the first floor more sprawling and spacious with an upstairs area with a second bar and connected tables for larger parties. We were lucky to grab a table at the bar seating area from a departing party of 2. The place is called Casa Agave tacos and tequila... so in True fashion we ordered tacos and tequila. The Cadillac margaritas were ok, a little on the syrupy side and heavy on the ice. It took two to get a buzz on.   Per recommendation of the waitress I ordered the mahi mahi taco and diablo taco with rice and beans. The diablo was nothing special and while the mahi was well seasoned with a sweet tangy taco sauce the tortillas weren't fresh at all. The rice was clumpy. I soon realized this was a place that thrives off its social atmosphere and not so much the food quality.   Good news is there's free chips and salsa, though the chips aren't salted enough and the salsa verde and roja lacks balance and/or kick. To rage with a group or drinking and to watch a game this place is ideal, in the heart of old town Scottsdale. If you're looking for a quality meal, go elsewhere.",

I also had a house margarita.  The margarita was good and not too sweet. Both tacos were delicious - but I truly did love the carnitas one the best which was the recommended!

Briana was our server, and she was fast and gave great tips to me as a new comer. I was craving cheese enchiladas, and I thought they turned out okay. I should have got red sauce, but I was worried it was going to be too spicy. I really loved the beans. Like I want to eat an entire burrito of those beans.  The guacamole app was good and uniquely had pomegranate seeds in it. The margaritas were great, and the service was fast and thorough.   I see why this is a regular place for my family, and I loved the intimate and fun vibe.",

But you really can't go wrong with anything. When I am back in Scottsdale, I will definitely be back At Cien Agave!",

A major part of our delightful dinner was attributed to the bartender named Sierra who seemed to single-handedly serve all alcoholic orders at the bar and entire restaurant while attending us at our separate high table seats nearby.    Our Monday's margarita drinks were just right - thanks in part to Sierra's enthusiasm in describing the drinks for us. Although the tortilla chips were not the best we ever had, we did enjoy our shared Beef Fajitas order - especially the tasty black beans. We ended our meal with a delightful Churros on Vanilla Ice Cream with Whipped Cream. All in all the service by various waiters/waitresses who also took care of us were very good. The atmosphere was lively for a sports bar with plenty of TV's all around. A good stop for our evening.",

At 645 other people who arrived after I placed my order receive their food. I said something to the person who brought their food about how long it was taking for my tacos and he respond in a rude tone \"the kitchen is very busy\". I explained that I had ordered 15 minutes before the food that had just arrived and he just walked away. A while later (655) my tacos came out and the ingredients inside the tortilla were cold. The margarita was watered down and the cold congealing tacos were mushy and salty. Very very disappointed.",

Ask to sit in the courtyard, it is a sliver between two buildings with a great atmosphere, heaters and a fire pit. It is a great place to bring friends which we plan to do next week.

The guacamole sprinkled with pomegranate seeds is excellent. The island shrimp tacos are good, although the diabla shrimp taco is my favorite! (I am also going to try the tinga taco before leaving Cien Agaves.)  Also, I moved to the patio where I could smoke, and Olivia provided a great experience there as well, by turning on the \"misters\" for a cooler Happy Hour.

    "text": "Had a fun dinner with coworkers on their Taco Tuesday, which can be a great deal with $2 chicken tinga tacos, half off their house margs and half off appetizers. Now, none of us partook in those deals (hello, expense account), but we still loved our dinners! Most of us did their two taco plate with beans (refried or black) and Spanish rice, but you could do three tacos, 10 or even 30 for $38, or something like that. You can also pick flour or corn tortillas. They had 20 or so funky taco choices so it was hard to narrow down, but I tried their seared ahi taco with chipotle jicama slaw and avocado as well as their spicy shrimp taco with rice and guajillo sauce ($4.95 each). Guajillo peppers are my jam and though the rice sounded weird on the menu, it worked, but maybe needed an additional sauce to jazz it up and make it less dry. I had an amazing habanero lime marg ($12), okay two margs, but they had a ton of options including cucumber, other fruits, beer margs with a bottle out the top and even skinny versions. Other meals on the menu included fajitas, enchiladas, salads, quesadillas and some yummy sounding bowls like the \"beets by Cien\" which, in addition to two colors of beets, also has shaved Brussels sprouts, chimichurri sauce and dried cranberries I think (could add proteins like chicken, steak, shrimp or salmon). Lively joint with two floors and lots of color inside. Great service that handled our large party spread across two tables and got us out in time for our next activity. Fun area in cute Old Town!",

She also sold us on the $2 shredded beef taco and then we had the burrito, both were excellent. We had the guacamole for an appetizer and I was hesitant about the pomegranate seeds but I trusted the recommendation and it was one of the best guacamoles I've had.  We never had to ask for chips and salsa and waters were given to us when we were greeted which was very pleasing.

It's seriously one of the best things I have ever eaten. I don't just throw that around, either. It's perfectly balanced and I crave it like I do sushi.  But thank the Lord it DOES have a liquor license, otherwise it would just be called \"Tacos.\" They hand-squeeze fresh limes for every single margarita. It makes for sore hands and more work for the bartender, but it is certainly worth it. It is honestly the best margarita I have ever had (aside from my own homemade ones, of course). The best thing about it is it's $3.50 during happy hour (3-7pm everyday), and happy hour lasts ALL DAY on Sunday during football season. Pretty awesome. I'm pretty in love with this place.  Also on Tuesdays, tinga tacos (chicken) are $1.50 and shredded beef tacos are $1.00 (if I remember correctly, don't quote me on that). Regardless, they're cheap. Also some cheap $2-3 beer deals, but beer is the same everywhere unless you're at a brewery, so whatever about that.  All in all, I love this place. OPEN A TEMPE LOCATION PLEASETHANKS!",

The guac was good.  Definitely take the staff's recommendation. They know what they're talking about. The staff gave us great recommendations on beverages and food.   And the t-shirts are great!!!",

LOL, you can tell I was impressed.  This place has a nice menu with many choices, its a little high end as far as pricing, but the quality is very good with so many combinations of tacos that you can get.  The particular visit, I had one fish taco only because I ate before, but I have been here before and the food is excellent.  If in the area, definitely give it a try.",

The hostess was prompt with finding us a table but if you could make reservations, I would because there aren't too many tables. The house margarita is really delicious...packs a nice punch too. Guacamole and green salsa stand out as fresh with great seasonings. I got the fajita bowl with carnitas, others at the table got the steak burrito ( not recommended) and steak salad. The house roasted Mexican street corn was delicious. What stands out as a real bummer is the service. The waitress really could have cared less if we were there, offered no recommendations (she doesn't eat here), and her attitude seemed kind of \"college bar annoyed.\" If they could step up the service game, this place would be four stars.",

    "text": "I dislike reviews that mention partial stars...until I have to write one that hits a gray area, so there I am with Cien Agaves. Guilty with indecision and admission that I have to clarify my selection with a more accurate rating of 2.5 stars. Really, I have had better. And it's also ok. For the price and location in Old Town, it's not too bad.  The food is just ok (that is...rounding up to \"just ok\"). The chips and salsa are pretty good with the cumin-strong tomatillo standing out over the red. The guac is also nice and a bit too addicting. The tacos are nothing to rave about, and actually I'm not likely to order them ever again, but I've enjoyed a salad or two with grilled fish. While most people rave about the happy hour, the food options are meat-centric so not much to choose from on those deals for a veg/fish eater. But at least the margaritas are cheap.  The atmosphere on a weekend night is pretty energetic and the margaritas have a nice, fresh (aka no mix) quality. Not much by way of beer selection though. For diners that aren't super picky about Mexican food and don't mind the grease, this is a solid option. If you're more akin to the taste of say Gallo Blanco, meet your unpicky friends here and stick with the booze with some chips and salsa to tide you over.",

But let's just get real here....this place is THE <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBOMB.COM&s=922b00e6ee5202c95e27b97f5b810dde60b61b547af64d68b87db899b0b4839c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BOMB.COM</a>!  It's a tiny little spot tucked away in Old Town in a strip mall so it's pretty random.    From the moment that Cucumber Marg touched my lips...it was over.  Right now they also have the Cantaloupe Marg that is new for the summer and it is also glorious.  I mean, the only one I haven't liked was jalapeno and that's only because I don't like a hot kick to my beverages, I like them to refresh me not kick me! ;)  They also have the tequila challenge which I have yet to begin, but one day I will start !  You can get on the plaque as well as a t-shirt.  Legend says, if you go one step further you get happy hour (or half price, I can't remember) drinks for life!    Their street tacos are also D'LISH!  My favorite is the Tinga, shredded yummy chicken with their sauce and cabbage! Amaze.  I have tried the majority of them and have not been dissapointed.   When it's nice out the patio is cute and quaint, not a bad spot to post up having some margs.  Otherwise, the vibe inside is also pretty great.  Bright and vibrant plus you can actually see the crowd rather than the alley outside where it's a bit more intimate.   Overall, this place is BOMB - TRY IT !",

We reviewed the menu and decided to get the chicken taquitos and the nachos to start. The water finally arrives, the chips and salsa had to be requested and was served after the appetizers were sent over? The nachos were fantastic but the taquitos seemed too plain for what it was advertised.

We ordered chips and guac, their complementary salsa and a friend got the nachos. We each had a Frozen House Margarita and the bill was only $28 between the three of us.   The guacamole was really well made, nice and chunky with a good hint of lime and chopped up cilantro and tomato. The portions are massive for only paying half price! You can't go wrong with their specials with the amount of food and the strength of the booze you get.   I've only been here one other time and again had a great experience. They have various taco options that are very good--not crazily adventurous but they will hit the spot and keep you satisfied.

I questioned the rush and found out the kitchen wasn't closing until 10:45 (why before 11?).    Upon taking a table our waitress also hurried us to order.  When our food arrived at 10:35, the meat in my tacos was room temperature, while my Fiance's meal was cooked well.  The waitress was just a step down from jogging everywhere and rushed every part of the service.  At one point her hurry to clear our table, she knocked over my beer which was thankfully 90% empty by then.    I don't think I'd like return, especially within an hour of closing.

Husband and I stopped in for lunch, had the prickly pear and watermelon margaritas, queso, and tacos and an enchilada.  Everything was amazing...margaritas were perfectly mixed, fresh, not too strong or too sour.  Queso was excellent, as were the salsas, and my husband had a side of guac and said it was excellent as well.  Now the tacos...the shredded beef taco was maybe the best thing I've ever eaten.  I didn't even share a bite with my husband.  I think it ruined tacos for me forever.  Hubby had a couple of other tacos as well and loved both of them, I also had a cheese enchilada and it was very good...but overshadowed by the taco.  Very reasonably priced for the quality of the food.  Service was great as well, but we were there for an early lunch on a Friday and the restaurant was not busy at all.  Looking forward to coming back next time we're in town!",

    "text": "Taco Tuesday is my one of my main reasons for living. They have an amazing happy hour on Tuesday where tacos are $2 and house margaritas are $3.50. If you need a good place to be obnoxious and talk shit, this is the place as it is LOUD. During their rush, service can be kind of slow and you have to ask for free chips and salsa to be delivered to your table. (I am of the mind that all restaurants, Mexican food or no Mexican food, should serve free chips and salsa. But I digress.)   For the price and the location, you can't beat it. Thank you Cien Agaves for helping me tolerate the rest of  my work week after getting drunk on your extremely cheap and tasty margaritas on Tuesdays.",

    "text": "Only okay.  On a visit to Old Scottsdale, I visited Cien Agaves based on Yelp reviews. The waitress was friendly - if not particularly knowledgeable. I asked for an old-fashioned \"not too sweet\" margarita - made with lime juice and simple syrup rather than sour mix. She had no idea what I was talking about.    I got the Two Taco plate  - a 'tinga' and a 'carne asada'.  The 'tinga' tasted like the oil in the deep fryer hadn't been changed in a while. kinda stale. The meat in the carne was both fatty and gristly. Maybe I just got a bad piece, but there were several inedible chunks in a fairly small taco. The rice and beans were bland.  After I finished up my meal, the waitress asked if I'd like any more chips. I mentioned that I hadn't  had any to start with, so I couldn't exactly have 'more'. She gasped \"didn't I bring you any chips?\" Nope.  She got them, but needn't have bothered. They - like the tinga taco - were too oily and  stale tasting. The salsas were just not all that interesting.  Nothing here was bad, but nothing was all that good either. I wouldn't go back.",

This place is kind of tucked away on one of the many side streets in Old Town Scottsdale but it's worth the trip.  I love that they have happy hour DAILY from 3p-7p. You can literally have a few margaritas ($3.50) and half price appetizers or ($1.50) tacos by yourself for about $25. I went there on a Sunday afternoon with 2 other ppl and we ordered about 7 appetizers, 9 margaritas, a dessert and coffee for a little over $60 and we were all full. All in all, the food was pretty decent as were the drinks. I'd come here again to just hang out with a few ppl, watch sports on the many TV's and have a few drinks.",

    "text": "Cien Agaves is a funky little joint located right in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale. They are known for their tacos and tequilas... 15 different tacos and 100 varieties of tequila to be exact. It's casual, open late, and their menu was calling our name when my husband and I arrived in Scottsdale one recent evening.  We started with the tasty chips served with two salsas (one a mild red and the other a sweet verde) and chose a large margarita to split. There were also 16 different margaritas on the menu, and we went with The Local. The concoction of Cruz Silver Tequila, fresh squeezed lime juice, and triple sec was a hit with both of us. This place was beginning to feel like a \"choose your own adventure book\" meal and I was feeling adventurous!     Carrying on with our adventure, it was time to pick the entree. Being that they are known for their tacos, I went with... pasta! Just kidding. I got the tacos, silly. There are three options to choose from depending on how hungry you are. You can go with a two taco or three taco meal (served with rice and black or refried beans) or a ten taco platter. With any of the three, you can mix and match your taco selections. I picked the Tinga Taco (shredded chicken breast braised in chipotle sauce, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mexican crema in crispy corn tortilla), Pollo Asado Taco (grilled chicken breast mixed with pico de gallo, topped with guacamole in a soft flour tortilla), and Tecate Fish Taco (beer battered ono, cabbage, mango salsa, and baja sauce in a soft flour tortilla). I can't even choose a favorite, as all three were equally delicious! My husband opted for a chicken chimichanga that was filled with shredded breast meat, rice, and cheddar then topped with even more cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. It was roughly the size of a brick. I kid you not. I believe I even saw a neighboring building built out of these monsters.  After my meal, I totally feel like I chose all the right paths in my adventure book. It was so much fun, I hope to go down a few different paths sometime in the future and see where they might lead.",

    "text": "The fiance and I went here not too long ago and the place was dead, which typically is not a bad thing.  Cien Agaves  is the typical Scottsdale restaurant trying too hard to be hip, cool, and gilded.  If you wear a tapout shirt, a trucker hat, own a purse that has Coach or Louis Vuitton logos plastered all over it, or support your millionaire-like partying lifestyle with a $30k a year job, then this is the place for you.  It comes off as an insincere/non-genuine attempt to produce quality southwestern food and the forced atmosphere comes off as tacky.  And a large tequila selection does not legitimize a restaurant - what a large tequila selection is to a restaurant is what a corvette is to a 50 tear old man in a mid-life crisis, they are trying to compensate for something.  Meal: I took full advantage of the pork and chicken tacos.  The fiance had three or four vegetarian tacos.  We both had a margarita.  I had the house margarita and she went for a fruitier (I want to say raspberry, but I could be totally off . . . SAMSONITE) style of margarita.  Taste:  Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh, these tacos didn't leave a good, lasting impression.  The key to an outstanding taco is an outstanding tortilla.  That doesn't mean they have to be homemade, but it does certainly help.  These tortillas were no where close to being outstanding.  The tortillas were incredibly dry and cold.  They lacked the structural integrity to keep all the guts of a the taco in tact so you can eat it.  It turned into a complete hot mess when the fiance and I went to dig in.  The fillings were significantly lacking any real seasoning.  For example, one of the tacos I picked was supposed to include green chiles.  I saw stuff on the taco that looked like green chiles but it sure as hell didn't taste like it.  To top it off, the margaritas weren't that good either.  5 out of 10.  Value:  Like the margaritas, the value was nothing to brag about.  Not bad, not great . . .   I didn't feel ripped off after I paid for the bill, but it felt like the meal was missing something else given the price we paid.  2 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  The waitress really seemed like she was pissed off to be at work that day.  We constantly had empty water glasses.  She would swing by to pick up empty glasses, plates, and other things but wouldn't ask us if we needed anything else.  And she would always run to the bar to talk to the bartender and another server.  We were the only people in the place.  There was no excuse for the poor service.  3 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  See above opening statement.  I guess I jumped the gun and couldn't put my thoughts in the right location in my review. 1 out of 5.  Overall:  There are so many better places to go to in the valley, why bother coming here?  11 out of 30 points, 1 out of 5 stars.",

By the time the other end of the table had gotten their food, we were done eating.. even though we all ordered at the same time.  -My order was not correct. I was hungry and ate it anyway. When I told the waitress, she brought out the correct food for me and didn't charge me for it (which I insisted otherwise).. I thought that was really nice.  -The food itself was just mediocre. Living in AZ, you know good mexican food. This place misses the mark.  Just an ok place. Maybe I would have had a different experience if it weren't a group venture.",

When my tacos arrived I was very disappointed.  Each flour tortilla had about two tablespoons of meat in it and nothing else. No guacamole or salsa fresca. The rice was kind of just glopped on the plate and the beans were very bland, they tasted like they had no salt or seasonings at all.  The plate presentation was one of the worst I have ever seen and I just felt that whoever made the plate had no love of cooking.  I will not go back.

However, I'd usually prefer to dine at a place that does just a few items well. Cien Agaves is an example of this. They do tacos and tequila. Yes, they have a couple of other standard-fare mexican items, but they're all about the tacos and tequila.  I had been there once before, and last night I went there again for a birthday party. Off the top, their tequila selection is solid - plenty of sippers available, and the prices are reasonable.  I did the 3-taco platter. Based on a friend's suggestion, I tried the Tinga taco, and that was the only one I didn't love. It wasn't bad or anything, but just not my thing. The Camarones a la diabla taco was delicious and had the bite as advertised, and the Ahi tuna taco was fantastic.  I look forward to returning sometime to enjoy their happy hour.",

Hostess told us the only 2 top table was upstairs and \"feel free to go up there.\" We sit at an open table. 5 min later a server asks us if we were seated there, we told her hostess said pick a table. She said we need to go back downstairs to tell the hostess we sat there? So we did. Hostess said \"ok great.\" Didn't give us menus or any further direction. No more acknowledgment from the server back upstairs. So we moved to a high top (it was dirty but only one available) thinking the bartender would serve us there. A busser got the dishes from the table and we were still not acknowledged by any server. At this point it was 8:55 and we decided to leave. No waters, no menus, no acknowledgment. Honestly pretty unbelievable.",

The interior design of the place is pleasing and makes you feel like you're in a Mexican saloon featuring sugar skulls and luchadora mask paintings/murals.   Our server Adam was friendly and attentive. We took his recommendation to order the pulled pork queso appetizer, which is half off during happy hour along with all of the other apps. I have been recently dissatisfied with queso dips at various Mexican joints such as Diego Pops and Illegal Pete's to name two but I could not stop eating this queso... it was perfectly balanced, flavorful, and fresh. For entrees, we ordered tacos. They have a great selection all served a la carte and you can mix and match if you do a plate with rice & beans. I substituted the rice & beans for their elote (Mexican street corn). Many restaurants attempt to recreate elote, and by no means was Cien Agaves traditional, but it was DELICIOUS. The tacos I tried were grilled mahi mahi, carne asada, and shrimp diablo. The shrimp diablo was less spicy than anticipated - I found the beer battered shrimp taco my friend ordered to be more spicy actually.  Overall great experience, looking forward to returning and trying more delicious food!",

The homemade margarita mix was delicious, but how about being able to recognize that there is some tequila in them - must have been the smallest shot glass on earth.

The mahi mahi was bitter and flat out inedible; I'm not sure if the fish had gone bad but I wouldn't have eaten it either way.  The beer battered fish was a tiny sliver of fish over an overly sweet garnish/filling.  The spicy shrimp were cloyingly sweet and tasted like someone had put a scoop of cheap Chinese food in a corn tortilla.  We brought this to the waitress's attention and they credited $2 to our bill.   My husband's salad was decent but quite pricy by the time he had some extra vegetables and guacamole added.  The guacamole and queso we had to start with were both fine, as were the rice and beans served as sides.  I vacillated between a 1 and a 2 on this rating and decided to be generous with a 2.  If street tacos and tequila are what you're craving I'd recommend Joyride Taco House which is a 4 or 5 star experience for the same concept.",

    "text": "Our overall review based soley on today's dining experience is 3.5 stars. However, we have visited Cien Agaves probably a dozen times over the past year and those experiences average 4 stars. I think today was just a slightly \"off\" day for the kitchen.  To start, we visited during a very busy spring training game lunch, and the place was packed with a nice variety of tourists and locals alike. We were impressed that we were able to be seated quickly and got our drinks and order in before several large groups. The salsas and chips arrived rapidly after our request for them, and we were happy to have them to enjoy while we waited for our lunch. The green salsa was tart and tasty; the red salsa with a large pieces of onion and tomato (I love a chunky salsa) was even better. The chips were fresh and warm.  We had a very good waitress who kept our refills coming and did a great job keeping in touch with us throughout the course of our time at the restaurant. Like I said, this was very impressive service in spite of the crowd in the restaurant.   My hubby and I ordered our two favorite meals at Cien Agaves for lunch. He got the chorizo cheese crisp; I got the green chili pork soup. My soup was GREAT! It had wonderful tender chunks of pork, plus the vegetables were cooked perfectly to the way I like them, gently pliable but not mush. It also had the right amount of spice, just enough to make me sweat ever so slightly.  The problem with our meal occured with the cheese crisp. First, the amount of chorizo was stingy. Secondly, and more importantly, it was burned on the bottom to the point that is all we could taste was BURNT. When the waitress stopped by to check on us shortly after the meals were delivered, we explained this problem and she immediately sent this flawed cheese crisp packing, back to the kitchen.  Before too long, we were greeted with another crisp. The amount of chorizo was increased, which was good. This time, however, the crisp was slightly undercooked and slimy, making it more difficult to eat. On the other hand, the flavors this time, of the cheese and onions and sausage, came through nicely so we proceeded to eat this second cheese crisp even though it wasn't CRISP. Better than too CRISP, I guess.  All in all, I was sorry to give today's experience 3.5 stars instead of the 4 our meals usually deserve. But like I said, something was \"off\" in the kitchen today, which lowered the rating for us. However, it will not keep us from visiting Cien Agaves again.",

The chips and salsa were so-so (but gratis thankfully) and the carne asada tacos were very good.  Little Lady had the vegetarian tacos (zuchinni, yuck!) which she enjoyed (did I mention they were filled with zuchinni? yuck!).  We didn't have full dinner service as this was just an afternoon pit stop, but I would love to return.  The patio is nice and tucked away on the side, and we had a great afternoon snack and cocktail.  If I can find a couple solid go-to dishes, this place promises to be my go-to Mexican spot in the 'dale--and the 'dale needs some good Mexican food desperately!",

The decor is great and the music is always perfect for the atmosphere.  The cucumber margarita is a must try and you can easily fill up on the chips and salsa.  I don't eat meat but my friends love the tinga tacos and I am a fan of the veggie tacos and fajitas. The guacamole and nachos are also great! They have a vast selection of tequilas and a tequila hall of fame.  If you want to make the hall of fame just ask the bartender how and they'll give you all the details. It's a great way to explore and find your favorite tequila.  They also have lots of events and specials like taco tuesdays and margarita mondays.  I take all friends and family from out of town here and if/when I move, this will be the place I miss and crave the most! :)",

I ordered their Al Pastor tacos, wife had their beef tacos. Al Pastor was just OK, if you ever had Al Pastor, you know what kind of explosive flavor it should have! This one didn't!! Wife's taco was actually better then mine! It had shredded beef that was soaked in its juice, in a fried shell. Very good taco. Tacos come with beans and rice. Rice wasn't that good, tasted like it came out of the box. Beans had no flavor, NOTE!! Black beans were a lot better!!! We also shared a prickly pear margarita, very strong! (glad we shared it!!) I have had better. We had a good time, service was great all away around! If I was back in the area, I could see myself going there again.",

We dropped by last spring during a gigantic street fest and even though we were wedged in a corner on their top floor, we still received food and drinks with prompt service.  BUT, what gave me pause on our most recent trip is a new addition to their menu: BOWLS. (\"bowls, bowls, all types of bowls...chips and mints and seashell bowls\")   More specifically: The Beats by Cien (cute) bowl. You guys, this is a freaking treat, and one you wouldn't expect to stumble upon in a little taco shack in Old Town: roasted red and gold beets, grape tomatoes, grilled corn and chimichurri are all mashed around in some avocado and served upon a bed of shaved sauteed-warm Brussels and dried cranberries. The flavors and textures are outstanding. I think my beloved papas con queso tacos have competition in my heart, and it's this meal.",

The previous nights events vaguely present in my memory like a faintly visible lighthouse from a sea bound schooner on a cold and foggy morning. I was desperately in need of a beverage and food to soften the impact the previous night's events had on my body and soul. It was Michal Ann who first greeted me upon entering the comfortable and welcoming establishment. Candy skulls and vibrant colors adorn the walls of the tequila bar which many have said is the only place Chuck Norris will sip his favorite Mezcal. After being served my favorite beverage, made to perfection by the legendary Michal Ann, I was quickly served some of the best tacos I've had north of Oaxaca by Alison, who placed them in front of me with a smile and friendly greeting which made me feel right at home. After I drank away my sorrows and ate enough food to calm stomach, I enjoyed the culturally unique and soothing music which plays daily at the best taco&tequila bar in the southwest. On the way out I completed my ritual of grabbing a toothpick and throwing \"deuces\" to the staff. Until next time Cien Agaves. Until next time...",

It was a large plate of a bunch of salad leafs and about 6 strips of ahi. The ahi was not pink at all... and was mushy ewww!  Obviously it was previously frozen.

The salsas and chips were great, and we tried the cucumber margarita, prickly pear margarita, and the habanero marg, and they were all good, made with the veg/fruit/pepper FRESH.  We just had nachos but they were plentiful and mighty tasty. Big fat slices of jalapenos on top and visually appealing.   The ambience isn't uniform in places (mixing early 90's modern furniture with homestyle Mexican decor and art), but it's just subtle enough to not be incredibly annoying. The male staff were very cool and relaxed, but the females were a little bit \"in the way\"... eavesdropping, it seems. We were one of 2 couples in the bar, though...  Regardless, this place deserves 5 stars. It's a very delicious, very easy Mexican choice in downtown Scottsdale.",

House margarita was pretty good, but  overpriced ($7) considering the glass was filled to the rim with ice, resulting in a rather small drink.  Both salsas were tasty (red tomato-based and green tomatillo), both spicy but the heat was not overpowering.  I love the ala carte idea for the taco menu as there are many to try, but found the food to be less than impressive.  I had a chicken taco (pollo asado) and beef (carne asada).  The chicken was bland and at room temperature.  The beef was a little more flavorful, but still only mildly warm.  My husband tried the lobster and fish tacos.  Both were overcooked and he complained there was not enough fish and too much cabbage.  He also ordered grilled street corn, but they apparently forgot to grill it.  Cien Agaves definitely has a fun atmosphere, cool decor, and a great idea with focusing on tequila and tacos, but the experience is lost with average food at best.  Reserve this place for happy hour, but look elsewhere for a good meal.",

Cien Agaves has a cool, open building and has some neat art hanging on the walls.  The margaritas I had here were head and shoulders above the ones I've had at nearly every other Valley establishment (especially at places like Dos Gringos or Salty Senorita).  I came here after work with friends and we ordered a house margarita for $4 (happy hour special). It had a lot of ice in it, but tasted really fresh and packed a punch. Then I tried one of their more expensive prickly pear margaritas -- yum! Delicious, without being cloyingly sweet. We didn't get any food, but the chips were great and the two salsas included a pico de gallo and a really amazing green salsa that included tomatillos and, I think, cumin. Great!  The only downside was the service. Our waiter was really nice, but the poor guy seemed completely overworked -- I think they only had one waiter for the entire restaurant and patio. If they hired another one or two servers, the experience would be more enjoyable AND they'd probably move a lot more margaritas! But I definitely plan on coming back here and seeing if maybe that aspect was just an off-night for them.  Try the patio if you can -- it's lovely and it gets you away from the rather loud music that could be playing inside.",

One would think that Cien Agaves would be 33 1/3 times better, but sadly, it was not the case.  Walking down First Avenue, we saw Cien Agaves and decided to try it.  We asked for a table on the patio, and they gladly accommodated our request.  We were lucky to get a table on the actual patio, not in the driveway next to it.  The driveway was home to 6-8 tables and a few heating lamps.  We sat down and enjoyed the potpourri of smell sensations: fresh spring Arizona air, grilled onions and second-hand smoke.  The couple next to us sure did enjoy those Marlboro lights.  Our server was quick, efficient and friendly.  She managed to keep up with our indecisive party of six, while refilling our drinks, waters and chips and salsa.  The food here, however, just wasn't very good.  I ordered a steak fajita, which may have been a mistake.  The giant skillet had a lot of onions and bell peppers on it, but not too much in the steak department.  It may have been a blessing in disguise, because the few morsels of steak I did find were not particularly tasty.  They were overcooked, rough and flavorless.    I did like the atmosphere and the service here, but the food wasn't even of Chevy's quality.  It's definitely more of a place to get a drink with your friends and maybe have a taco or two (or ten - the whole taco combination platter).    2.5 stars.",

My husband had a burrito with red and green sauce and it was a hit. I had their Tinga taco and carne asada taco, and I wasn't in love with the tinga taco but the carne asada was good! I also had one of their Prickly Pear margaritas (I was most excited for this as you can't find these anywhere in Milwaukee) but I was a tad disappointed. It wasn't as good as ones I've had elsewhere and it was pretty pricey at $12. Their chips and salsa were great though as they have a few different salsa choices they give you instead of just the typical one. All in all, it was a good experience and I'm glad we stopped in!",

I ordered the Lean Green Machine (made vegan by excluding the yogurt) and, aside from it not tasting like Mexican food, the dish was executed poorly. Everyone at the table oohed and aahed at how pretty my dish looked, and commented on how it looked like it must have tasted so good...but was boring. Even more boring was the small amount of alcohol they put in their margaritas.  Come on guys, I can only fit so much in my stomach, I don't want to drink 10 margaritas in order to get a tiny buzz.  Meh overall!",

The food: To be honest there food was ok - it was decent sized for the price but the island shrimp taco tastes more like sweet and sour chicken balls with shrimp, and the diablo shrimp taco was definitely not hot. It was standard fare that felt tasted like any other big chain Tex mex resto in North America.   But our service today (along with our instable appetite at the moment) made it a  good experience.",

By the time my girlfriends arrived we weren't greeted for about 15 minutes and finally got to the point to ask for menus. The bartender during the evening didn't even acknowledge us until we told him we were ready to order (I think it's because we weren't heavy drinking during the evening). All we ordered for the evening were al la carte tacos. My friend places in a last minute order of a salmon taco and this taco came out within 5 minutes. Wow! That was quick. 10 minutes go by and our other tacos are still not at the bar; additional 10 minutes go by and we asked if our tacos were coming by, and he mentions \"they should be.\" 5-7 minutes later we asked if he could check on our order. He then goes to the kitchen slamming the kitchen doors, as if we were bothering his \"evening.\" We then realized he never checked on our food, because when the food came out it was ice cold. The bartender never came by to check on our food, so at this point we were starving and just wanted to eat. So we ate the ice cold tacos for the evening and we're very disappointed with our visit. I don't know if the bartender was having a bad evening, but from experience working in a restaurant, please leave your business behind the door and do not let your attitude affect your evening and especially the guests.",

We were told we could only sit where we got seated if we could be done by 6...ok. We were seated and did not get a waitress until we were there almost 10 minutes... and the place was closer to empty then not. During those 10 minutes we had no contact with anyone, nobody brought chips and salsa like everyone else had, no water, nothing. When our waitress showed she got our drink order and guacamole order. She brought out the drinks and asked if we were ready to order dinner. We ordered then the guacamole came out. It said the guacamole had pomegranate seeds on it, so we decided to try it. The bowl looked like it was an entire bowl of pomegranate seeds, almost no green visible. There were only about half the chips needed to eat what was in the bowl and after 3 minutes we were out of chips. Our waitress checked on us after we sat chipless for several minutes, and I had to ask for chips and salsa as she didn't even look at our table. I'll admit I was beginning to be irritated. Our drinks were ok, my beer was not cold, just cooler, and my wife and sons mango margaritas looked good, but were average in flavor so they said. When our food arrived, the new food runner served 3 meals then dropped the serving tray. My wifes and my plate went down. I felt bad for the guy, it happens to us all. So my wife got a whole new order, done very hurriedly, and looking at it she would've been better off with what he dropped. My enchilada plate kinda spilled out over the side, and I thought I'd get a new one as well. Nope, it was just scooped up and re-served. It was messy with refried beans spilled all on the inside and outside of the plate. So we all ate, the quality was fair, but certainly uninspired to say the least, reminded me of Mexican food in the school lunch line honestly. The rest of my family said the same thing. All and all we were very disappointed. For 1 beer, 2 margaritas, and 5 less than average meals we paid $100. It was mostly a waste of money. One of my sons got severe stomach cramps 10 minutes after we left that lasted all night and took him out of first night of vacation. Our first meal on vacation was no bueno and will probably ruin our chances of any more Mexican food on this trip...a shame in Arizona...",

We had a reservation and they were great at checking in with us earlier in the day to make sure we were planning on coming and if we had any special request. We got there 15 mins early and BOOM, our table was ready! This gave them the 2 stars.  Unfortunately the food was the downfall. We all had tacos and they came out incredibly dry and flavorless, I am assuming they were left under a heat lamp a little too long. Probably the saving grace of our meal was the pork queso appetizer which was excellent. Maybe a couple extra margaritas before the food would of made it all taste better.",

I really enjoyed the artwork and Spanish themed baseball jerseys in the wall, such a fun vibe. We had an assortment of chips, salsa, guacamole but what really stood out was the queso verde with the pork. Simply fantastic! The house margarita seemed average to me, not too different than any other bar but I didn't try any of the specialized kinds (which I regret). Though everyone else got tacos, I stuck with a steak burrito. Very filling and tasty. For the amount of people our server had to deal with he was fantastic! Easily the best service we received on the trip. I'll be back for spring training at the end of the month and will come back for some lunch before the going to the game.",

Topped off by it being #MargaritaMonday made it a delicious spot for a meal. The only negative was the noise level, but that's typical of most popular two-level open restaurants. Good points?

Took FOREVER to get our margaritas and we saw them just sitting at the bar waiting to be picked up.   The server forgot our appetizers of chips and guacamole. The food came out pretty quick but my order was wrong. My boyfriend really wanted the guacamole for his main meal as well so when it never came he was disappointed and waited to start his meal hoping we could stop the server when she checked on us and ask about the guacamole. SHE NEVER CAME!!! We waited several minutes and she never came to check to see how our meal was. I finally walked up the the hostess and asked if they could grab our server. She comes rolling over from the bar and says \"you wanted to see me?\". Umm yaaaa......   The food even though it was wrong and cold by the time we got to eat it was good but the service is TERRIBLE!!!!",

Unfortunately, our group came here AFTER trying HH someplace else first where we were less than impressed, yet had a couple drinks and a little food in us, so I didn't try as much as I would have liked to.   The only food I had was the queso dip and it was SO GOOD! We ordered two servings for 6 people and I'm pretty sure I ate almost an entire order myself. Oops. The green chile pork added into it was delicious!  One of the girls I was with had a couple tacos and she said they were very good. I hear the guac hear is delicious, and I'd like to come back for it.   I obviously had a margarita as well. It was good, and tasted even better half price during HH :)  The restaurant itself is nice. It's two stories and I believe there's a bar on both stories. Lot's of seating and our service was great.   I'll come back.",

They have over a dozen kinds of tacos so if you can't find something you like, the problem is you, not them.    Service was below average. All the girls look alike and I kept mistaking a different one for my server.  Not really my fault since she really just went MIA.  I almost went back to the kitchen to look for her but then again, I wasn't really sure which one was her.  2 good things about this place: ample free parking and copious drink specials.  The tequila flow keeps the place lively and loud which leads to great people watching as well.",

I opted in for the nachos since all of the apps are half off during happy hour and they were Great! Salsas were also fabulous. Can't wait to continue to try more food and margaritas!!

The complementary chips and salsa were sooo good (not only saying that because I was hungry), you get a salsa verde as well as a red salsa. They were very willing to substitute parts of the dishes to our preference.

We wanted to come back at happy hour. Instead of telling us there was an hour wait already at 2pm, she let us leave. We came back at 3 only for her to tell us 2 hour wait when she could've put our name down over an hour before when we were all very sad we couldn't make a reservation! Came back 1 hour later to check on our spot and our name wasn't WRITTEN DOWN. Came back again. NUMBER WAS WRONG AND NO TEXT. She was eating at the stand! We left and went elsewhere. Never returning.

The guacamole was beyond the normal limitations of your everyday guacamole. This is the guacamole we need in our world.

It was busy, so the wait time was totally acceptable, but having my food be wrong, our table forgotten so we could check out and a completely rude server makes me never want to come back again.

There is a great happy hour menu and a large selection of margaritas. Chips and salsa, guacamole, and queso are really good. The salad I had was only so so, but my party ordered tacos for the most part which looked amazing!

It's good!  They have a smaller bar and that can fill up quickly, however you can eat at the bar (full menu) or at a table.

    "text": "My first response to parking in front of Cien Agaves was \"what in the hell am I doing in tourist land?\" Old Town is such a piece of shit. Unless you like fake western hokey crap stores and indian flute music, you'll want to barf. Of course, when you walk into Cien Agaves, you're transported to a different type of atmosphere instantaneously.   They score with Moises' art on the walls, with the industrial looking staircase in the middle of the restaurant, and the generally good soundtrack. There are parts of the restaurant that feel like the divey little places you'd find in Guadalupe, and other parts feel like a Tempe college kid bar. None of it, however, feels like a nice restaurant. The diamond plating in the restrooms is oddly reminiscent of a shotty strip club.   The food here was about what I would expect. Not as good as The Mission, Barrio Cafe, Los Sombreros, etc. But much more interesting than a place like Los Olivos. They offer about a dozen different tacos with all sorts of seafood, meat, and bird. Service on my visit was a little slow. We waited about 15 minutes for our check and finally asked for it. Who knows how long we would have waited otherwise.   My main observation while here was the crowd. Even though the restaurant feels like the divey Tempe college kid restaurant, the crowd it draws is a little different. There were quite a few roided up douchebags with spider web tattoos, affliction shirts, and stupid gay shit eating grins with some fake tittied blonde with a nosejob hanging on them. It kind of seemed like a bar for Scottsdale douchebags when they want to \"slum it\" and have \"mexican\" food.  I'll probably go back eventually, but if you're looking for a place to have good Mexican food, skip Cien Agaves. If you want to sip a few Coronas and have some tacos and salsa, you'll be happy as a clam here.",

Service was good and the place is nice inside. The chips and salsa were okay. I wasn't blown away by the salsa, but I enjoyed it. That's more than I can say for most places. The house margarita was merely okay as well. Nothing special. It was served in a stupid shaped glass which was annoying, but I drank it and can't complain.  I'll return sometime soon for a full meal, but I'm not going to bank on this place topping my list of great Mexican food. The search continues.",

I honestly could have had three more it was so tasty, but my childlike tolerance for boozin did not allow it.    The bartender was super nice and friendly, we had many refills of the chips and salsa (damn you, I can never resist), and it was all in a southwestern chill environment.

I can usually find a few vegetarian items at most restaurants but they're usually just OK.  What I had at this place was phenomenal!  For example their Pappas Con Queso (seasoned potatoes and cheese) and their grilled veggie tacos were can you say mouthwateringly awesome?! Also, they have the most deliciously fresh and exotic salad dressing made of a prickly pear vinaigrette.  But, my fave of all was their creamy poblano soup, was just the perfect amount of spicy mixed with creamy that has your mouth saying \"ahhhh\" and \"mmmmm\" after each spoonful.  Looking forward to trying some of their other tasty food creations and drinks at my fabulously new food crush place!",

He recommended the Ahi tacos, which the bf chose and said were good. I had the Tinga and Polla Asado tacos and was very pleased. The Tinga was probably my fave cuz of the spicyness but the Asado was great and lighter feeling in my belly.  Their chips and salsas are great... and Free!  =)   The bf had the Prickly Pear marg, which he wasn't big on... He likes fruity things, so prob just a taste preference thing.  I have a few friends who rave about the Cucumber marg, which i've tasted and is very good. The Chambord marg is also quite tasty! With a name like Cien Agave, i don't see how you can go wrong.",

No syrups or mixes, this is straight tequila and lime juice baby, very refreshing and delicious! And for 4 bucks on a Monday evening, how can you go wrong?  Their specials are all very good: Margarita Monday (as mentioned) with half price Apps, and Taco Tuesday with their dollar tacos and $2 tecate's...HELL YA.   They have a great range of tacos here and all are pretty delicious. Try the nachos with Al Pastor on them too, delicioso! Their chips and salsas also kick ass.   If youre looking for a low key place to hang out, snack, and drink then you'll enjoy this place and if you love margarita's then you'll REALLY enjoy this place",

My chicken was super spicy, my carnitas was too mild - but together they worked well.  My husband didn't particularly care for his lobster (skimpy, more breading than lobster) and thought his pork (not carnitas) was dry.  I really wish we tried harder to find a better place.      A few days later we did - heaven lies just down the street at Frank and Lupes.  We visited on a Sunday or Monday in September for dinner and were the only patrons.    The economy sucks man!",

Its a happy hour that won't break you. Don't propose here or anything. Well, unless you want to.  And service was great, nice decor. It is kind of like El Hefe without the craziness.

We could have gone anywhere..Came in and got seated by the host immediately who was very friendly. Looked at the menu as we wanted to check out everything so after a time of watching our waitress Nikki standing and socializing and talking with some guys we were ready to order and waited. Ok fine. Food was delicious, so that's good. shrimp tacos and Ono fish tacos were great.  So I notice that Nikki didn't give us chips and salsa or ever bring it to our table! When I see every other table have them! And the other waitress was offering it the table behind us! Um really? Why didn't we get them? It's just showing how you could give a crap to bother. So lazy! I was pretty irked by that, then another person brings our food to the table while Nikki is still gabbing away with her co workers. Ok. We wait for a long time to get our check, until Nikki says she is going to get our checks out to the table. Then I see Nikki Run out the door to her friends on the street saying \"I'm off!!!\" Um, I'm still sitting and waiting for our check over 15 mins later.. I got up after Nikki was talking away with her friends outside and completely forgets about us. Hello??? I went to the front and asked the hostess to get her and give us our checks so we can leave! Does Nikki not take her job seriously?! To top it off her attitude was so obvious and rude I cannot believe it. Nikki in a huff ran to the back to get our checks. Gave them to our table so fast then ran off again without taking my money even! I am sorry I even needed to break change because she gave me about 5 effing nickels instead of a quarter. Why?! Give me nickels cuz you're mad I asked you to do your damn job?!! Idiot.  The hostess told me our waitress \"mother was in town.\" Um what? She should have said I'm sorry I will get her right away! No Nikki you were not off work! and you should be fired for how you treated me and walking outside like we didn't exist! I wish we had the waitress behind us because she seemed very nice. If it's the end of your shift don't blame that on guests! Some people are not meant to be in the service industry and Nikki is one. Regret getting her as a waitress. And I want yelp to know. Fire her!!",

Nevertheless, the manager was able to set us up outside and actually I preferred that - coming from Oregon we will take outside seating whenever we can get it!  The salsa was so good the chips were mainly just a disguise for me drinking it.  We got a pitcher of sangria and a bunch of margaritas, all very good.  I really liked the flavor of the margarita with the habanero in it.  It was VERY spicy, but the flavor was better than some I've had with a jalapeno.    Our server was really nice and attentive and everyone enjoyed their meals.  The only thing I didn't care for was the pico on the tacos.  It was so onion-heavy it made the tacos a bit bitter.",

I had the burrito smothered in red enchilada sauce. Had a nice kick, and the burrito itself was huge. The black beans it came with on the side were very tasty. Tortilla chips appear to be make in house. Patio is very nice and somewhat intimate. Would visit again.",

BUT this was wasn't bad. Only thing was I wish I had more of it. I ordered a 12oz bowl, and got 2 small, less than half filled containers of soup. I spoke with the Manager, Bob, he seemed distracted while speaking to me and almost like I was a bother. He said he would credit me a soup for next time. Thankfully the soup was good enough to go back and have again. Overall bad first impression, and mediocre customer service",

From the time we walked in until we left we were pleasantly surprised at every turn.  We just happened to have arrived on taco Tuesday to enjoy $2 shredded beef tacos and $2 Tecate but we also had tequila, margaritas and other dishes from the regular menu.  Our party shared the food and everyone was impressed.  When next we visit Arizona we WILL make this a mandatory stop.  Highly recommended!!!",

    "text": "I frequent this place a lot.  Its a great Mexican restaurant in the middle of Old Town, where there is a daily happy hour deal.  I'm not a fan of tequila, but if you are, this place is a must visit.  They have it all...  As for the food, I enjoy the fish tacos, as well as the baja lobster tacos.  Absolutely delicious!  I always tell myself I'm just getting 2 tacos, but end up getting 3 or sometimes, even four!  The guacamole is pretty good here as well. It always seems to sneak its way on our table as well.    As for the service:  My fiance and I come here a lot, so we've had our share of good and bad servers.  Some are very friendly and are more than happy to please you, however, we've had a server or two who never checks up on you and takes 20 minutes to bring a beer even when its not busy.  Service is kind of hit-or-miss, but the food definitely makes up for it, and the prices are more than fair.  We've even used Cien Agaves to cater for a baby shower.  They allowed us to rent out the upstairs area.  It was out of the way and private, and the food was very satisfying.  They did a great job.",

While I didn't come on Taco Tuesday (which I should have for their $1 tacos and $2 Tecates), I did come for Margarita Monday (ok, I made that up - margaritas here are a must every day of the week). We came in before their daily happy hour ended at 7pm and enjoyed some awesome house margies for half price - $3.50! And these suckers were pretty big too.   Food was delicioso. I had a carnitas burrito and went with our server's rec to get it enchilada style and got the spicy red sauce. I'm glad I did, because it was so good wet (hmm, TWHS). Their signature chicken fajitas were really tasty as well. Entrees were so big that I couldn't imagine getting any appetizers or dessert - although an after dinner shot of tequila? Si, senor! Obviously, they had a list of cien tequilas on their menu. As much as I love Clase Azul, we decided to get shots of Milagro Anejo and saved ourselves $400.  All in all, a fun spot in Old Town Scottsdale to get your Mex fix!",

I've been here 6 times for happy hours and decided to use my Living Social deal for a dinner last weekend.   Bad decision, my happy hour memories are ruined. Stale chips, slow and awful service and I found a hair in the free salsa and had an overall horrible experience. I used a Living Social deal for $10 for $20 and the visit solidified my decision to not go back again, not even for happy hour.  The service is awful, the hostess doesn't greet people as they enter or say goodbye as they leave...I never thought I'd notice a hostess so much until I saw how little this one did. She spent most the time picking at her nails while at the front.   We had a party of 5 total and 3 of them came after we had already ordered our drinks. Our server never took drink orders for them and we had to grab her to order more food.   Our food wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good. Service was horrible, but they didn't even seem that busy.  We would have ended up spending a lot more $ here on food and drinks but decided to go other places in old town to get good service.  Management...please take the helpful hints, because I know you can be a good restaurant.",
