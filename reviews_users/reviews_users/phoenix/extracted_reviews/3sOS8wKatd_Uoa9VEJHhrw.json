    "text": "Just updating to mention that Miracle Mile has made me some great catering trays as well over the years.  Today was no different. I got a couple of large catering trays (a dessert sampler and a fruit salad) to go for a lunchtime work function.  They do offer delivery for large orders, but today I just grabbed them myself.  They were a huge hit (particularly the cheesecake and brownies).  As soon as I mentioned where I got them from my coworkers immediately talked about how much they missed Miracle Mile's old location at Arrowhead Mall.  Needless to say, both the fruit salad and desserts were polished off in record time.  Josh, you've been put on notice.  The west side wants their Miracle Mile back.",

You can choose any bread but marble rye is so good it comes with turkey, coleslaw, and dressing like a thousand island. You also receive French fries but there are other side choices and a dill pickle. Portions are a good size and they do not skimp on the meat.  Service is quick you order at the counter and your food is on a tray when you reach the register. Everyone is friendly and smiling.   They also have salads,hot dogs, soup, and entree choices such as a turkey plate or stuffed cabbage or fish if you are not in a sandwich mood. Come hungry and enjoy.",

The space is a lot smaller, but the look and the feel are just the same.  It's cafeteria style and we were able to get a table.   I've never been here for dinner, but have eaten here for lunch plenty of times.  Even though I always want to try something different, I always go to..... my go to sandwich.  I usually get the straw or just pastrami with sauerkraut.  I ordered the straw and mac and cheese.  The sandwich wasn't as big as I remembered but the mac and cheese was on point!  The food was good and probably one of the better delicatessen's in the valley.  I would recommend for a good lunch, but expect to spend 10 to 15 including drink.",

    "text": "Visiting PHX from NYC, I was looking forward to testing the mettle of this pretty popular lunch spot. I drove passed the restaurant multiple times during my stay to find the parking lot full - that's pretty impressive for any place that labels itself a \"Deli\". It had to be awesome, no?   No. The \"New Yorker\" - Pastrami and Cole Slaw on Rye - was bland, boring, and bogus. It had no flavor, except for the tang of the slaw, and the bread was stiff, like it had been stored away in a fridge all night. It was disappointing, Kind of like when you wanted that bike for Christmas but then got two little rubber balls instead - one for each hand. But I'm not unreasonable or naive; I know it's difficult to make a pastrami sandwich that can stand next to the greats like Katz's or Langer's (2nd Ave Deli, Carnegie Deli, etc). I don't walk into a Deli in Phoenix expecting the Pastrami Gods to rain down on me a storm of deliciously irresistible and perfectly sliced pieces of cured meats; I don't have unrealistic expectations. I just wanted a decent pastrami sandwich but I didn't get it. It fell flat, completely flat.  Having said all that negative stuff, though, I must admit that the restaurant itself is well-run, overwhelmingly clean, and their service is top-notch - everyone was pleasant and helpful. Also, I can't deny that all the food looked appetizing and fresh. My sandwich fell flat but I can't speak to anything else. My son had the kid's hot dog and he loved it. I would suggest try the food. The food on the menu and behind the deli case looks good. Give it a shot. I might if I had to but I wouldn't order the pastrami sandwich (or \"New Yorker\") again.",

So many options to choose from. It's similar to a long cafeteria line but with amazing food choices and sides. I literally wanted every one of those sides! We needed up getting a turkey club and the Asian salad. Our son got the matzo ball soup & Mac & cheese. It was all amazing. You will not be disappointed with all they have to offer.   Try the lox plate! I saw it after I had ordered my salad and was bummed I didn't get that. It looks SO yummy!",

The couple in front of us and ourselves both left to eat elsewhere!   How stupid to turn away customers!  Hi Joshua,  Thank you for your reply.... before we went today, I checked the website, NOTHING is listed about you can't order lunch until after 11:15 am on the weekends! It says breakfast is served until 11 am. We were there at 11:05 am, back in car and leaving at 11:06 am. Per your website, we should have been able to order lunch.",

    "text": "Following a recent trip to New York City, I had found myself craving a solid pastrami sandwich. A coworker raved about Miracle Mile when I told her, so I had it in the back of my mind going into the weekend.  I went in around 5 p.m. on a Saturday and it was pretty mellow, which was a good thing because it took more than five minutes to narrow down which sandwich I wanted to order! Come ready to make some tough decisions -- or to eat two sandwiches!  Based on a few recommendations from behind the counter, I went with The Straw -- a 6-inch-tall pile of pastrami, swiss and sauerkraut between an onion roll. Holy brined brisket -- it was delicious.  I washed it all down with a Grand Canyon Brewing Co. lager -- one of three local taps (they also had Huss from Tempe!). I lucked out, too, because I was there during \"tappy hour\" (3 to 6 p.m. every day), so my beer was only $3!  The staff were incredibly attentive. It brought the typical deli experience up a notch. Rafael, who appeared to be one of the managers, stopped by our table twice to check in. Once he found out it was our first time, he convinced us to make some room in our bulging bellies for their famous bread pudding.  Best. Gluttonous. Choice. Ever.  My date and I decided to split it, but I'll admit now that I could have totally eaten his portion once I got started! Dripping with caramel, the bread pudding managed to temporarily bump the sandwich off its tastebud pedestal. It was so, so creamy and not too sweet.  I guess as one craving was fulfilled, I won't be able to stop thinking about my newly acquired one.  In a nutshell, though: Miracle Mile definitely put me in an \"Empire State of Mind.\"",

There is no getting around the fact that the food is good. but the prices are high for having to stand in line and order your food like you were back in grade school. For these prices there should be a wait person taking my order.      I had the Stuff Cabbage Roll and it is by far the best I've had anywhere. Mostly because it was stuffed and huge. Not some small pathetic thing, but actually worth the money. The sauce was good but typical and went along way to improving my side of steamed veg that didn't really taste so great until I dipped them in the sweet sauce that was left over.     My friends sandwich was good but a disappointment in size for the price. Any other real deli would have put on 3 time the meat.      To be honest the best side was my friends chili. I would drive across town just for a bowl of it and saw no thanks to the rest of the food, except my stuffed cabbage. It was just right. Lots of rich flavor with out being to spicy.       If you want a seat down deli experience try a better place. If your looking for a slightly over priced cafeteria meal that acts like a deli, spend your money here.",

The server brought the coffee and was barely even warm. We asked for hot coffee and the server brought 2 more cups of coffee no warmer than the firsts that came previously. When the breakfast came the eggs were over cooked and the Lox was a smaller than usual amount. Overall we both agreed that these were poor breakfasts were not enjoyable. We agreed that the food at Chompies was far superior. It is sad because I have been a constant customer for over 35 years.",

I was positive that Costco had options and ended up waiting until 24 hrs beforehand until learning that they do not.   I literally had no idea what I was going to do or where to even look. I ended up searching Google for places that had fruit platters. I was directed to Miracle Mile but at this point, about 6 pm, I figured I messed up. I believe when I called they were already closed, however, someone was still there and answered the phone. I explained the situation and explained my understanding if it was impossible to grab an order at before they even opened the next dy. The gent on the phone said \"no problem, give me a call when you're at the window and we will have your order\".  I was shocked and ecstatic! I went the following day to grab the order, I believe it was the same guy I spoke to on the phone. He was pleasant and kind and even gave me plates and napkins which I should have known to ask for but was too distracted to do so. Honestly, he made it all worthwhile and left me with the best impression of the place.  The fruit was delicious and fresh, what more could I have asked for?  Super cool.

The pretzel buns are moist and perfect compliment to the pastrami, which isn't overly fatty. Pickle, mac n cheese and potato salad rounded out my meal. It's actually enough for two people, each person half a sandwich and one side per. Save money by sharing a meal here and adding extra sides as needed. Unlock yelp code for free mac n cheese",

He would frequent it when he worked downtown and on and off over the years he would take our family there for lunch whenever we were in the neighborhood. I was pretty bummed when it closed down and figured that was kind of it for the place. When I was out driving a few weeks back I passed by the new location and wondered if it was the same family or someone else who just took the name. I was happy to see it's still the same owners and I finally was able to get in yesterday to try it out.   After staring at the menu for far too long I went with what I used to order years ago, the Jax (beef brisket). It's honestly too much food, but it's worth hating yourself after. The new location is clean and constantly being tended to by the various staff members. It was also as good as I remember and I wanted to try about 50 different things. I will definitely be back now that I know it's there.",

If you want to read something long read about valence electrons and the relationship with electricity.  Now time for the food.  It is St Patties day, so we wanted corned beef and cabbage.  I got the corned beef with potatoes only and two slices of bread.  The corned beef was really yummy too.  The potatoes were good and had a different flavour.  Plus the best part a pickle too.  I did want to have a slice of pie, but passed. The corned beef, potatoes and pickle were enough.  I like this place and recommend it to anyone.  Remember food is subjective.

Wait I'm the line with a nicely lit up menu board above so all can see. This place still reminds me of a cafeteria style eatery.   Oh well so be it. I ordered my usual which is the New Yorker on a Kaiser roll. They slap thousand island dressing on the roll with hot pastrami and coleslaw. It comes with fries. Cause I Yelp checked in, you get a free side of Mac and Cheese too.   So I would have to say the hot pastrami was good. Not great. Didn't stand out to me. It's a good portion sandwich. The Mac and cheese was ok. Nothing special. Actually thought it was a little bland.   So we find our own table and when you done their people are really good at cleaning up your table and taking your finished tray.   To be honest with you, lots of people come here. Good food. Not great. Nothing to write home about. My personal feeling is that they get a lot of people cause there really isn't a good deli around. This is a $$ place for a sandwich. Little pricy for a sandwich. Like I said it's good. Not great. Will I be back? Maybe. Maybe not.",

The \"straw\" sandwich is very tasty, with the excellent pastrami, Swiss cheese and sauerkraut--I love it on the onion bun! Their Reuben's are consistently good. A lot of the times, I just get a hot pastrami sandwich, on rye bread, and put yellow mustard on with each bite, goodness I just love it so much! Other menu items that are consistently good are their dinner specials. I love the turkey dinner which they have daily--so if you wanted, you could have a full thanksgiving dinner, nightly, and the taste is great. Just as delicious as grandmas cooking! Excellent portion size, fair price. My husband loves the stuffed cabbage dinner and gets it often. I've tried it and that's delicious as well. This place is worth your time and money! Consistently great, friendly service too!",

Miracle Mile can make you just about any sandwich (hot or cold) your heart desires, but where they really shine is in their pastrami and roast beef cuts. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. You choose whatever bread you'd like (I go with marble rye most of the time); they have plenty of options and they are always fresh and delicious. Once you've chosen your base you can put whatever you want between your slices and make your sandwich as simple or complex as you want. Along with bread, meats, and toppings you also have side options that include potatoes in various forms (mashed, fried, salad), macaroni salad, mac and cheese, coleslaw, salad, veggies etc. If you have a sweet tooth grab a cookie or piece of cake at the end of the line and enjoy!   Most delis aren't exactly inviting to eat in, but Miracle Mile is a great place to pop a squat and chow down. It is clean, comfortable, and a good place to relax and enjoy. If you don't want to eat in or are in a rush you are in luck, they have a go go window...yes a to go window! Call in your order to pick up or walk up and order to have it ready in a jiffy. You just can't go wrong with this yummy deli!",

My husband ordered the bbq chicken sandwich and said the chicken was very dry.  We got two free sides of Mac and cheese for checking in and it wasn't bad!

The concept Miracle Mile uses isn't that great if you want great quality food put out. How can there be with a busy assembly line? There is no real quality control here.   I love deli food and have to many around town and in other states. This one just doesn't compare.   Sorry Miracle Mile, but you won't make the cut when I want my next deli fix.",

The people working there are sooo nice. We dined in, at least 2 different people came by to ask \"How is everything\" our mouths were completely full both times so we were only able to nod and give them a thumbs up lol  Unfortunately I checked in on Yelp after I sat down and places my order so I didn't get the free side order of Mac and cheese.

Because they had good coverage on Channel 3, on Veteran's Day of 2015, I stopped at their new location and was very, very, disappointed. I ordered the Hot Pastrami on Rye and it was nothing like the one I used to get at their previous location on 20th & Camelback/Highland. They skimped on the pastrami considerably. I guess to help pay for the new building they built. The old Miracle Mile sandwich was damn near 3 inches tall and the sandwich at the current location barely came to a little (very little) over an inch and a half. And that is including the bread. I can get more for my money at Segal's on 7th street or other places. they might be out of my way but definitely worth doing. Parking seems ample, but since it's on the east side of 16th street, and if you're trying to exit south on 16th street, you'll have to wait for a pause in north and south bound traffic unless you want to cruise the neighborhood and get back on Campbell then make a left.

My husband had surveyed the assortment of desserts before we sat down and even though our meal was very filling we couldn't resist the chocolate cake and cherry cheesecake.

It is obvious from the tone of your words (some misspelled) that you are angry and misinformed.  My choice to not be a customer is based on my treatment at your operation and nothing more, I have no agenda and am insulted that you would insinuate that I do.  If you had 7 managers on duty that day...where were they? I saw 4 employees and nothing more, where to you hide your managers? Also, if employees are trained correctly, you would never need 7 managers at one time...EVER. The fact remains that I was lured in with False information, laughed at when I requested an item and then given excuses by you for all the so called \"misunderstandings\" and you continue to do so now.  George would be ashamed! and believe me that I am sad that my experience was so terrible, but I just cannot waste my time and energy on establishments that don't meet my expectations.  Phoenix is FULL of great restaurants, and many have been around longer than yours, and have been functioning without 7 managers on duty, rude employees and misinformation. Those are the restaurants I will frequent.  Thank you again (I thanked you already) for your offer, but no thank you.",

The meat was a good serving and the cabbage done just right.  Will absolutely return.",

The macaroni & cheese was average at best. Definitely not homemade tasting at all. All in all NOT worth 11 bucks! I will say that the kosher hot dogs are very good. I guess people come here for the sandwiches but that's not my thing. I wanted to try the bread pudding but it's supposed to be served warm with vanilla sauce or ice cream so theirs is obviously not fresh as it's sitting there sliced behind the glass like cake. I won't be back as to me all the hype ended up being just a tad bit better than cafeteria food",

The food tastes as if they only use good quality ingredients which makes this trip much healthier for lunch than the average fast food joint. L I recommend getting the miracle mile sandwich combo which was half of a sandwich hot or cold (I got the TurkeyCran which was yummy) and two sides. I tried their fries (which were also super yummy) and the Mac and cheese. The Mac and Cheese was DELISH. It was so much food and didn't get close to finishing it all. I also took a chocolate shake to go and I was quite surprised how great that was. It wasn't too sweet so I didn't feel like I was slurping chocolate syrup. I think I'll be craving those shakes! The only negative was the parking. Show up EARLY or LATE during lunch hour or be prepared to wait for a parking spot.",

LOTS of turkey and super thinly sliced onions made this Sammy \"hit the spot\" for lunch.  Get the Mac n cheese for a side... creamy, cheesy and yummy!!! My kiddo is a Matzo Ball Soup afficianado, so he ordered that and a strawberry milkshake. They serve a traditional Matzo Ball Soup, but if you like the more chicken noodle soup style, just ask and they'll do it for you. My hubby got the Mile burger and it was seriously some of the best pastrami I've ever had. It came on a super fresh Kaiser roll and with a generous 1/3 lb. beef patty. The BEST part of my visit...BREAD PUDDING!!!!!! My son took one bite and began singing an angelic version of \"HALLELUJAH\".  The.

Personally it wasn't bad, nothing compared to the famous pastrami sandwich at Katz Deli in NYC. But hey who am I to argue as the sandwich was savory but a little on the dry side with the Rye bread. Overall will come by and pay another visit to try there other listed sandwiches such as I am a fan of corned beef.",

I crave the New Yorker sandwich and when nothing else will satisfy, this is the place I head to. The ambiance is basic, though clean. The food is good but not great. I probably go for more nostalgic reasons than anything, but it is decent. Though it has become a lot pricier over the years. We got five sandwiches and it was $67!!",

Stand in line to order at the counter and take a number.  Once the food is ready they will bring it out to you.  This is not a full service restaurant but the food does comes out incredibly fast.    The Matzo Ball soup was delicious and a value item at $3 a bowl.  The Reuben was pretty good, they were able to substitute coleslaw instead of sauerkraut for me, but at $12 it is priced on the higher end.  All in all I'd love to come back to the Miracle Mile again.  Great neighborhood deli.",

It was good food, just wasn't enough to satisfy me unfortunately. I was kinda disappointed in that left me wanted more!   Please don't let the photo fool you, it's not a lot of meat.

    "text": "Best New York style deli outside of New York. Fresh and hot pastrami and corned beef. Order your food from the hot counter and watch the cooks prep your sandwich and sides right in front of you. My only issue was during the ordering process the guys behind the counter assume everyone wants fries... Which is natural with a sandwich but they overlooked my request for two other sides and I ended up waiting for one of the guys to notice me again so that I could order them. Once they get your order the cooks move fast. So you get your meal very quickly.  The food. Okay seriously... It's all good. I ordered 'The Straw' which is freshly cut hot pastrami on an onion roll with Coleslaw and \"Miracle Mile\" sauce which roughly translates to thousand island dressing. This sandwich was BIG. Not stage deli insane big, but a really good sized sandwich. The meat was REALLY tasty. Best pastrami I've ever had outside of New York.  I used the Yelp coupon for a free mac&cheese. It was good not great. I also got a side of boiled potatoes that was actually quite good. The fries are above average.   My wife had the Turkey Club. The bread wasn't toasted, but otherwise the sandwich was very good. On the whole it was a very good dining experience.   Here's something worth noting if you expect a dingy New York style diner. This place is CLEAN. It's very well kept and modern looking. It almost feels like Epcot center... If Disney chose to have a New York Deli section in Epcot. The food is great, but the cleanliness and modern flairs threw me for a loop. I just expect New York delis to be loud and dingy. This place was quite lovely. That's both a compliment and a bit of a dig. It'd almost too nice... But I still enjoyed eating there quite a bit. The food was solidly good.   If you miss the east coast hot pastrami deli food this is the place to go in Phoenix. If you're looking for a hole in the wall deli... This is NOT that kind of place. It's very nice, well kept, and new. They also have numerous options for dessert including pies: apple, pecan, lemon meringue, chocolate moose, bread pudding, etc. Good stuff.",

Which is a pastrami sandwhich topped with Cole slaw and their famous miracle like dressing. I must say it did NOT disappoint! The meat was so savory and the sandwhich as a whole was intense. It's a large entree so don't come here with a small appetite, or at least be prepared to share. I loved the flavoring and enjoyed that it came with a side (I chose fries) and a pickle.  I also really likes how quick and easy the service was. They passed the food down the line and all employees got a chance to quickly interact with me, which definitely gave it a friendly touch.  Although it was busy and full of people talking, the restaurant seemed relatively quiet and peaceful, which was very nice. I think they may have some sort of sound absorbent ceilings to help with the noise level, which I really enjoyed.  All in all, it's a great simple restaurant to come check out!",

Not having eaten since breakfast, I was pretty hungry, and they're known for their pastrami sandwiches so I ordered the New Yorker on sourdough with ice tea to drink. Let me tell you, they do not skimp on the meat -- this is one delicious but intense sandwich. Also I'm not usually one to seek out coleslaw but it worked really well with the savory hot pastrami. I would certainly order this again ... if I can split it with someone! The mac & cheese I got as my side with the sandwich was also super tasty. Either way I'll definitely be back to try out some of their other menu items.",

The rye is toasty, the corned beef is thing and juicy, the sauerkraut is tangy, the sauce isn't overpowering, and the cheese is nice and melty. Is it the best deli in Phoenix? Absolutely not. Probably not even the best deli within two square miles. But, the portions are outrageously huge at a reasonable price.  I do caution that the sides have each left something to be desired. The mac and cheese is reminiscent of the stuff I used to get in my public school cafeteria. The potato salad tastes like the stuff my aunt brings to the family barbecue that she forgot about until the last minute, and then it sits out for a while. Not great, but you eat it anyways. Even the fries typically come out a little on the soggy and sad side of things. At the end of the day, I'll go back regularly because the sandwiches make it worth it. I've yet to be disappointed by that, and that's what really counts here.",

    "text": "Just got done saying how fresh and terrific Chompies PV was, is, and now: better.   Interesting, The Corner Bakery, a Brinker (Chili's) concept replaced Miracle Mile Deli in this location. Corner Bakery lasted less than a year, Miracle Mile built their business there for 10 years. lasted at least 10 years (by Fry's, 20th St. and Camelback).  Now, Miracle Mile is located 16th St, south of Highland Ave., went there tonight, 1/17/2018 and it was FABULOUS!!                                                         THE BEST!!!!!     They've got a deal, 1/2 sandwich and cup of soup, $10. Sheesh. Big fat Kaiser roll, corned beef, sauerkraut...AND A SIDE!! I got fries and they were good, hot, crisp...next time, either slaw or both.  The rye bread is so fresh!!!!  Miracle Mile knows enough to fry the sauerkraut ~ takes just enough unnecessary \"sour\" moisture out, and you don't need it.  (Because If anything should be dripping down your chin it's Gulden's mustard, not sauerkraut juice. God...so good, hot, moist, fresh, so good!  Real turkey. Not pressed turkey. Not shiny turkey.   You know, as I've gotten older I realized that it could be Boarshead or Subway, but shiny turkey is still shiny turkey. Again, this is REAL off-the-bone turkey.   Better than Chompies. Better, better deals, better attitude, a more family-owed presence.   Now, I know you're going to tell me that Chompies IS family-owned but I don't see the family visiting their restaurants...and...Lou and Lovey...???  By the way, let me ask you a question: have you EVER been to Chompies and noticed the manager, any manager that WASN'T filled with anxiety?   Because I never have. Every person of authority I've ever met ANY Chompies locations has been VISIBLY FILLED WITH ANXIETY.  Why?}  When you eat a meal that's so good you can't wait to eat it again, that's a good restaurant, a great meal!  {By the way, Miracle Mile Deli has excellent mac & cheese!  No excess. Excellent!}  Next deli fix?  Miracle Mile!",

I've been a loyal Chompies patron but decided to try this place out, being in the neighborhood.  First off, very clean and a very friendly staff. Organized like a Cafeteria. We ordered The New Yorker which is a Hot Pastrami on Rye Sandwich and a Reuben Sandwich, both come with a side choice which we chose French Fries.   Onto the food, what Deli doesn't have Chopped Liver and Bagels? The meat itself in both sandwiches was good, a little too lean for our liking though. The Rye Bread very OK. The French Fries very OK too. Its like cafeteria deli. Sorry going back to my Chompies traditional New York style Deli.   I finally glad I tried this place though.",

Today I had the opportunity to be physically close by at the lunch hour.  My bubble burst!  We had the \"Combo (combination of our two most popular meats, hot Pastrami and hot Corned Beef, stacked together)\" and the \"New Yorker (Hot Pastrami topped with homemade cole slaw and Miracle Mile Dressing)\". The sandwiches were both on onion rolls but I couldn't see any onions or taste them. The meats were lean and tender, and appeared dry and with very little flavor.  The accompanying french fries were dry and tepid.  My wife loves fries but left over 3/4 of them and I managed to eat half.  The portion of fries was small as well. The kosher dill pickle was excellent! Our iced tea was good and the bill was high for what you had.  Parking in their lot was very difficult, had to wait for someone to leave. Two stars is about right unfortunately.",

Though the sandwiches were good, they not delicious like they used to be. The manager was very, very welcoming and nice so I felt bad telling him what i really felt and told him they were good. Clearly, he was really hoping we liked it! We got our usual; Ruben on onion roll and Pastromi on Onion roll. We never went back. One of the things that they need to do is slice the meat paper thin, like it used to be. It made for a delicious, tender sandwich. The meat is just to thick.",

When you visit for the first time, unless you're a crazy person who dislikes pastrami, you order \"The Straw.\"  There's a thousand photos of it here, and, trust all of us, it's incredibly delicious.  For my other visits, I ordered their Times Square Cheesesteak.  I thought The Stack was going to be their best sandwich, but, for my money, their cheesesteak was heaven.  It comes piping hot with gooey cheese and peppers.  Try it for yourself and enjoy the bliss.  What surprised me the most about Miracle Mile is how kind and attentive the staff is.  Every time I visited, the bussers offered to refill my soda.  It took me by complete surprise.  That great service put them over the top in my book.  Next time I'm back in town, I'm going back just to explore more of the menu.  I'm sure there's tons that I'd love and didn't have the opportunity to try.",

    "text": "The Miracle Mile Deli between Camelback and Indian School on 16th Street is an attempt to bring a proper east coast Deli to the Phoenix area. They have been in business for a long time, but recently moved to their new and spacious location.  Food is served cafeteria style with a standard Deli menu. Pastrami is made in house and is a specialty. I love pastrami so I had to sample some on Rye of course. Mustard is available on the tables, so no need to request it on the sandwich.  The pastrami was very good and is probably the best available in the area. It's not quite NYC level, but good anyway. I also opted for a generous scoop of delicious potato salad and their tasty pickle spear. Everything was very good and served fast.  Miracle Mile Deli is everything you are looking for in an east coast style Deli in the middle of the desert.",

Right across from Camelview Elementary is the famous Miracle Mile that I grew up with. I went in and was happy to see my old above mentioned favorites as well as some new items added to the menu. My family and friends were so happy when I told them the news and we all went out and had a family dinner and I almost forgot how bomb the French fries were!!!",

    "text": "Make this your next brunch stop. Lunch and dinner at Miracle Mile deli are great, and other reviewers here do a nice job covering the details of the sandwiches that stack almost as high as a solo cup. Breakfast, though? You are in for a great surprise.  First, make sure to bring friends with you. This is going to be for selfish reasons. Try to plant some ideas in their heads of what they should order, because you want to diversify the plates that come to the table so you can broaden your sampling horizons. It's going to help you decide what to get the next time you come back because you will already be planning your next time. The breakfast is *that* good.   I've had breakfast at MMD 3 times now. I went with the super nova lox and found the bagel to be just right, the lox were delicious, and the veggies on the plate were all very fresh. That made it my go-to order 2 times, but I switched it up after hearing from my dad and my husband about the Empire State burrito. Not everyone can nail chorizo, but this was spot on. The chorizo is flavorful and balances very well with the eggs and potatoes. I could have eaten it on its own, but the salsa they have on the side is clearly (and fabulously) made on the premises by someone who knows what they're doing. Often you can tell how good a restaurant is by how well they pay attention to details like this.   My son had the cinnamon roll pancakes which are pretty much dessert masquerading as breakfast. (Not that I blame him). The frosting as fantastic and the  pancakes are tasty, but that dish is jussssst edged out by the glazed banana walnut pancakes. Every bit of flavor there is fantastic, and like the salsa, the candied walnuts are another sign of that consistent attention to detail.  I should probably go for the pastrami hash next time since that's pretty much MMD's wheelhouse. At least that gives me an excuse to get back soon.",

I ordered the bread pudding, I have never had it so don't have anything to compare it to but it was big and not bad.

From what we understand, the other location was larger, but this was just perfect for a quick quality early Saturday lunch. Why now after 20 years?  Truthfully, we've largely given up on restaurants after many disappointments.  We are also fortunate that one of us is a terrific cook, and usually prefer home-cooked meals. But everyone wants to have a go-to place or two, and now we have one.    Parking was no problem.  The food was fresh and high quality, everyone was professional and pleasant, and as others have mentioned, the place was clean. Pretty much everything Chompies claims to be, Miracle Mile really is!",

Also have had delicious brisket, cheese steak, and awesome potato pancakes. The fries were very fresh and tasty. All in all it seems my first not so good experience was only a one time thing and the food quality has been very good since then. Also love the variety of sides. The Mac and cheese was very good as well. This can be a busy place and it can be tough for the service people but they are working hard to provide good service.",

In fact their service is miles ahead of most full service restraints - miracle miles ahead! We love you guys! Then there's the food... The pastrami \"straw\" sandwich is gorgeous! Get that! Their barbecue pastrami is wonderful too. Some days they have turkey dinners with mashed potatoes and stuffing - awesome. I often enjoy a cup of their Matzo ball soup. Yummy. The kids meals come with a ticket. When your kid brings the ticket back to the counter they are given a cookie and are treated with a trinket of choice out of their toy box - fun!

    "text": "I came across this place by accident and been eating there weekly since January 2015 and can say the following things about the place.  Staff-the nicest staff in any food service establishment in the Valley. Staff takes time out to talk with the customers. They know customers by name and always smiling.  Atmosphere-Nice and welcoming atmosphere. The 19th street location was almost like a cafeteria atmosphere with all the colors and white. It reminded me of the 1980s but can say it was so clean that I would have ate my food off the floor. The new location on 16th street is awesome. Complete opposite of the previous. I really like the take out window!!!  Food-I have tried almost everything on the menu and can say hands down that I have not had a bad meal yet. The food is ALWAYS fresh and delicious. It appears to be very high quality food at a very reasonable price. I would rather drive the extra 15 minutes and get a quality meal at Miracle Mile than a fast food establishment next to my house. I like the rewards card that they offer with the free meal after the tenth visit. Embarrassed to say that I have already gone through five cards. I may have a problem. LOL!!!!!!  Recent Visit- Went in for breakfast on 06/21/2015 for the second time and decided to order the Asparagus French Toast but  was told they were out of asparagus after selling eight in a couple hours compared to a few a week.. Instead, I got omelet  which was great. I like that I can pick what I want in the omelet, which I usually only like vegetables. Management gave me a $15.00 gift card because of the inconvenience, apologized and asked if they could make me a side of french toast. I told him it was okay and will wait until next time.   Overall Thought-This is one of the only places I will eat at in the valley besides one other establishment in Tempe Marketplace. I noticed that there increased some of the prices by $0.50 with the new location. I really didn't mind the increase because you get a lot for your money and it is really good quality. You can tell a lot about a place by the condition of their restrooms and the kitchen. Both are extremely clean and smell fresh, which is a huge thing for me when eating out. .Plus, staff are always washing their hands, which is another use plus about this place. I will continue to eat at this establishment weekly as long as they continue to provide the same quality of food and friendly atmosphere.",

Herded through a cafeteria line where they dish out food like im in grade school simply doesn't do it for me.  That alone would have me giving them 4 stars but when you consider that they are a little pricey.... That gives you 3 stars.  Maybe I am not cool enough to get it.  Ok I beyond laughed at the response to my review.  Well played!  I love a place that doesn't take themselves too serious and can have a little fun.  I'm giving you a star back because you made me laugh days after my meal.",

    "text": "Nice new building and location for Miracle Mile. I had a light appetite so I ordered the chili. I know chili in July. Who does that in Arizona when its over 100 degres outside! However the chili was good. Miracle has a variety of foods to order. Like cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, salads, soups, and deserts. They even have cabbage. I was shocked to see beer and wine offered.   Funny thing though; I looked around to get a good look at the place. And I noticed it was filled with senior citizens. So I'm not sure if Miracle Mile on 16th Street and Campbell is a senior citizen hangout. Or if it was senior citizen day.   Perhaps there was a senior citizen party. Don't get me wrong I love seniors. However it was just odd to see so many in one place, at one time... On the positive side it was nice to see all types of people get out and enjoy theirself at Miracle Mile.  Recommendation: The chili I ordered was good;  however nothing to brag about. I did notice they have hefty portions of cakes:-). A decent and clean place to go if u have a light or no appeitite in particular. Since there is a variety of different foods to order.",

My recommendation: if it's your first time try not to go at 12:00 because the staff is busy and rushed. I had not been here before and 1 of the staff out of the 5 I encountered actually listened to what I wanted to order. I ordered a custom turkey sandwich (bacon, turkey, chipotle mayo, cheddar cheese) when the guy just started to put lettuce and mayo on my sandwich and I had to cut him off and tell him (again) what I wanted. He put regular mayo and then one of the other staff stepped in and told him I wanted chipotle mayo. I was going to let it slide and not say anything, so he ended up putting both on (which I said was fine).   The Mac and cheese was very good and fresh. The wheat bread for my sandwich was very good also. Everything tastes fabulous!   This place just needs to work on listening to their customers and not making them feel as rushed.",

I would give it 1 star but their employees are very nice and their food is fresh, a bit too pricey for what it's worth.  Update in reply to Miracle Mile's response: Please change the cleaning solution you use, the smell is too strong and it smells like a nursing home. Many people have shared this with me and I'm sure you will get more business when you do. I've been there many times and gave it many chances and it was always someone mopping the floor while I'm eating there and the smell is horrible! Horrible!!!!! Yes you all take great pride in cleaning but the cleaning solution smells too strong and not pleasant almost to the point that I don't think it's healthy to be around that strong scent. I will update my review when you let us know that has changed.",

We went in on a Saturday morning around 10:30 a.m. and there was a decent crowd but lucky for us the line was short. It took us a while to figure out what we wanted (everything sounded so good) but I decided on the omelette and my friends ordered the bagel and lox. We both ordered coffee. The staff was extremely friendly and I thought it was great that it was an open kitchen. We grabbed out coffee and our number and found a comfy booth. The entire restaurant was extremely clean.   Our food came pretty quickly and we were excited to dig in. Everything was delicious, the coffee was freshly brewed and the omelette was perfection. You could tell that everything had been prepared fresh and again the entire staff was so friendly, my coffee never got half empty without someone offering to refill it and the plates were quickly taken away once we were all finished. I absolutely recommend this place for breakfast, and I will have to try it out for lunch!",

Some things u see through the glass but it's not clear how to order or what comes with a side item or which side items are an upgrade.  They rush u through the line and don't really give u time to ask questions.  Or the person to ask doesn't speak clear English.  I guess u just have to become a regular and figure it all out.  I love the straw sandwich which is pastrami with hot cheese and sauerkraut.  Also their salads are huge and delicious.  The price u pay is a bit more than the typical lunch spot but the speed of service and quantity of options is unbeatable.  Oh and if u check in on yelp u get a free mac and cheese!!!!",

This family owned and operated local gem is a MUST when in Phoenix. In the last few years, they've moved to a more modern space on 16th Street and Campbell. It has been in the family for generations and you can tell by the warm service and friendly faces.   They serve typical Jewish Deli fare and the portions DO NOT disappoint. You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches and i'm a HUGE fan of their mac and cheese! I love their pastrami and corned beef. Both are so lean and flavorful. But the star of the show is their corned beef platter over St. Patty's Day! It comes with thinly sliced lean corned beef, cabbage, boiled potatoes, and 2 slices of rye bread with butter. SO YUM! EVERYTHING here is amazing and the food comes so quickly!   Their desserts are also delish if you have a sweet tooth. I can't wait for our next visit. Thank you Josh and team for being so hospitable and always ensuring a 5-star experience.",

Because I checked in on Yelp and it is my first visit, I received an instant coupon for a small side of macaroni and cheese, which I passed to my husband after sampling a bite :) The food was hot, fresh and delicious.

The prices are fair for the portions, the staff is very nice, and everything is kept extremely clean.  My only small compliant is the matzah ball soup. The matzah balls themselves are nice, but the broth lacks flavor and it could use some more veggies. This is the one suggestion I have for their menu.

We were amazed at how long some of the employees have been working here.   My wife ordered \"the straw\", a classic hot pastrami with melted swiss and kraut on an onion roll. I'm not a pastrami guy but, wow that was great -- lean, juicy and packed full of smoky flavor.  I went with my favorite deli sandwich - the reuben - again a fantastic version of a classic - grilled rye, heaps of lean corned beef, swiss, kraut and just overall yummy goodness!  One knock - fries were okay nothing special but, slaw was awesome!  Sandwiches are plenty big enough to share, but you may not want too. The menu has breakfast/brunch, lunch to dinner items.

I had just moved to the Phoenix area from New Mexico and made friends with a very special co worker.  She introduced me to the Miracle Mike Deli and what an experience.  New York style deli food, lots of choices, great atmosphere and very, very reasonable prices. I have to admit, outside of the Pastrami on rye, cole slaw, fries and lemon meringue  pie, I'm kinda at a loss.  Tried the meat loaf, roasted turkey, cabbage rolls but always go back to the Pastrami on rye. This is a must go to place. Not open late so dinner needs to be a bit early, but damn if it's not the best lunch deal out there. Located near the Biltmore area, it's  literally off the 51 freeway and the lines go ultra quick. Don't take my word for it. Go get some great deli food at Miracle Mile.",

My family has been dining at miracle mile at their original location since I was just a toddler, I am now 21, and come at least twice a month, and I live 40 minutes away. Nothing beats the atmosphere, standing in line for your sandwich like you do in New York. The staff remembers regulars orders, they're always friendly, and the food is always fabulous. The pastrami and corned beef are their best. Like both but can't decide ? Than my favorite, \"the combo\" is for you. Both meats on one glorious bun. I recommend the onion roll. The New Yorker is my favorite as far as pastrami goes, it's topped with coleslaw and dressing. And on that note, one final thought, their honey mustard i assume is homemade. I wish I could bottle it up and take it home.",

Their new location on 16th Street is very clean & contemporary, but their BBQ pastrami sandwich was the worse I've ever eaten in my life.  I was so hungry that I ate half & took the rest home to feed to my dogs & chickens.  It was so over-cooked that it almost tasted burnt, and the sauce had no moisture left, making the over-cooked pastrami dry and chewy.  It also had a lot of gristle that was not edible.  I must have hit them on a really bad day.  I was so disappointed that I may not return & start going to Jason's Deli.",

This place has an interesting vibe to it and I like it. It's basically a cafeteria style deli. You order at the counter and a lot of the hot dishes are already made/displayed and plated in front of you. There's a wide variety of items to choose from.   Honestly, I wish I would have been more hungry when I came in and gotten a hot sandwich or specialty item, but the BLT I had was still delicious. I did the deal where you get a half with two sides. There was plenty of b & t on my sandwich and it tasted fresh. The sourdough bread was good as well. The pasta salad was tangy and the potato salad was creamy. I also got a small mac & cheese because it was free w/a Yelp check-in and it delicious. Very cheesy.    There's a lots of seating at Miracle Mile and they do serve beer and wine. Also, the kids meals come w/a cookie and prize but they give you a coupon to claim these AFTER your kid eats their meal. My nephew barely eats at restaurants, but knowing he wasn't going to get that cookie right away made him eat a little more than usual. I appreciated that :)  When I'm in this part of town I'll come back.",

In my opinion, one of the best around. You can choose from around 10 different breads to house all the juicy, tender meat. I usually take some home since the options are big.",

Now that I think about it, I didn't even realized I went there with my mom until I typed this. Hahaha.  Anyway! I love pastrami, and when I saw that there was one nearby during lunch, I had to stop by. The pastrami sandwich was amazing. The meat was tender and full of flavor. It looked so good just piled on top of the bread.  The fries were surprisingly good too. I was NOT expecting that. I ate everything and the mac and cheese too. If you check into Yelp, you get a free mac and cheese. Otherwise, they charge you $4 for so make sure you show them at the register!  Good sandwich! A little pricier than what I would like. It was over $15 with tax! And the mac and cheese was free! Well, it was a good experience so I'm ok with it.",

Everyone working here literally is ultra friendly!  Everything is super clean!  The food is amazing, at least everything I've had.  I love the stuffed cabbage which surprised me! I get it almost every time because it's amazingly fresh and flavor filled in a way that surprises me every time!  The pastrami sandwich is super awesome too!  Bread pudding as mentioned is a super great treat afterwards!  Stop by and feed your inner animal some food worth getting excited about!

There was always a line so I knew they were making $$ but now that the only location is here I rarely get to treat myself to the most filling meal ever. BBQ PASTRAMI!  Yes that's right. BBQ and pastrami are brought together into what I feel is the perfect hot sandwich. Pastrami is salty and the BBQ sauce is sweet. The mixture of those flavors is heavenly! Leaves you wanting for nothing! You got sweet, salty AND insanely filling all in 1 sandwich. It's messy so I usually fork and knife it. Onion roll is my favorite bread here. VERY soft and slightly sweet.   Instead of fries I usually opt for their delicious home made apple sauce. Remember yelp checkins get you a free side of mac and cheese. I usually get that to go for my kids.   In conclusion I never had a bad meal here and the line always seems to move quickly. I'll be back soon,  but really miss the Scottsdale location!",

My son has Down syndrome and is non verbal the gentleman helping my son was so polite .. he asked him what he wanted and walked my son down the line and let him basically create his own meal by pointing to what he wanted .. he even help him pick a drink .. so many people are rude or get frustrated with my son but this kind hearted gentleman went above and beyond to help my son .",

If you loved school lunch, military food, or ever did a stint in jail where they tried to serve a \"hot\" meal then this is the place for you!!  My wife wanted to try it so I thought I would play it safe and get a ham sandwich. I have no idea how they rang it up, but for basic ham sandwich with really high fat on the sliced cold \"holiday\" style ham, it came out to like 9 dollars.  Don't be in a hurry during lunch or dinner since it's confusing to order, and their typical customers move slow and get confused easily.",

Thought I would give them a try after moving , big mistake. Never again.  In addition to very high prices with the food line staff you have to repeat yourself as they seem not to understand you.  Over 9 minutes wait for a knish that was microwaved and was ready after our meal.  The brisket for there Broadway sandwich had no taste (unless you add mustard (i didn't but my sister did)  and i shouldn't forget the meat was dryer than the dust bowl of years ago.  I see now why there is only one location it should take a hint like it's former stores and CLOSE.  I will go back when Phoenix has its next blizzard.  Save your money and do your self a favor go to Scotts Generations.",

Since the downfall of the locations I grew up with at Park Central, and ChrisTown Malls, the closing of the locations at both Arrowhead and what used to be The Colonade Mall (turned into some kind of strip mall place), I was thinking I would never again get to have a hot pastrami sandwich from a place that has been in my life since I moved to Phoenix at the age of 4 and that had been in my maternal families life since before then.  We came on a Sunday around noon after we were at the cemetery for the unveiling of my Grandmother's headstone. It was had/has been an emotional time and going to a place that had an historical place in my memory and in our family seemed somewhat appropriate. The ONLY thing that was missing was the Karsha's rye bread (Karsha's closed) and the rye bread they are using isn't quite as tasty, with the right kind of pull. The pastrami was just like all of my memories.   MM used to be a Jewish Deli and has been Jewish \"Style\" for years and years now. My husband loved his turkeyBLTA and his side knish and everyone else enjoyed what they had.   Private parking lot- and perfectly planned thick covered door handle coverings so you don't burn your hands opening the door.  Looking forward to coming back.",

I ordered fries which were nicely cooked. The sandwich was delicious. The meat was tender and I had a very happy stomach. It was my first time having a matzo ball soup and I thought it was okay. It didn't have too much flavor and was a little bland which was fine because everything else was so heavy.   I probably would come again if I was craving some deli food.",

Not very fatty but full of flavor and goodness. He was a happy man.  He asked for additional meat on the sandwich and got quite a bit for a nominal fee.  The mac and cheese side was free because I signed into Yelp.  I tried to take a photo, but it seems to be gone.  I ordered the crispy Asian salad which came with breaded chicken and a sliced Mandarin Orange.  Very fresh and delicious. A huge portion with a wonderful plum sauce.  So friends, I would recommend that you go there soon and often.  Not much atmosphere, but very clean, great service and really wonderful, fresh food",

The mac n' cheese is a must try!  The eating area is very clean for a cafeteria style eating arrangement.  I had the pastrami and fries with the Yelp free side of mac n' cheese along with a large Dr. Pepper.  My total was $15.20 which seems a little pricey, but it doesn't break the bank.  Since there is no table service, I do wish they would offer a free refill on the large drink since it's packed with ice and priced at $2.50.  Overall, it's good food with ample seating, and best of all, it's very clean!  I won't wait another 30 years!",

The line to order is usually 5-15 groups deep, which provides just enough time to scope the menu, listen to other guests, and debate amongst your party what to get.  The menu consists of 7 adjacent 40\" televisions floating above the serving line and offers a typical, albeit, varied and delicious selection for a deli. These televisions also scroll through different pictures of popular dishes. If you didn't bring your appetite, that's okay, after a few pictures it will be sure to find you.  The food is incredible. High quality cuts of meat, hefty portions, and an appropriate price. Pictures just can't do it justice.  The serving staff, cashiers, and bussers are exceedingly friendly and very accommodating.  Tips for lunch time:   1. Carpool. Carpool. Carpool. The place is deceivingly large and can hold an impressive number of people. 2. Get a seat/table for your group when you walk in. (Or don't - staff seem try to find you a place or make a place for you - did I mention they were accommodating?) 3. Unless you have a 2 hour nap scheduled after lunch, get a box. You can eat the entire meal in one sitting and be completely satisfied, but don't say I didnt warn you about the impending food coma.  This place is everything and more than what I'm looking for in a place to eat.",

The coleslaw is runny and sweet. The mixed fruit was just melon. So, the pastrami itself is delicious I just think they need to fix their side options.   The staff and customer service is awesome. They're all nice and they all picked up my dirty dishes right away. I love that!  I love Miracle Mile's pastrami sandwich.

The promotion said i would get to pick a bonus gift card with a value of $20 to $100.  I didn't get to pick anything, the cashier gave me a gift card card $20 and said \"congratulations.\"  Was there really any different values? Maybe they even gave those out to people they knew? I felt cheated. They should have just said you get an extra $20 gift card, totally wasn't worth the additional effort i went through. I wouldn't have bought $100 worth either.",

    "text": "I will tell you that I have always been fond of Delicatessen food, but only in larger cities such as New York and Chicago.  I never really wanted to venture in here as my taste buds have rarely been satisfied with Miracle Mile's menu, regardless of whichever location I visited.  So, here we were driving north on 16th street, and my wife sees the new location, and asks if we could give the new place a try.  Reluctantly, I pulled in. The parking lot was fairly empty, especially for being this late on a Sunday Morning. A sparse parking lot, when there should be a myriad of cars present during a normal bustling period, is indicative of either bad food, bad service or perhaps even both.  Needless to say, we were both pleasantly surprised as to the overall cleanliness of the place, the wonderful servers, and the selection of the food. My wife had the Reuben, which she said was delicious, and I had the Cod. I thought it was a little on the bland side, but it really wasn't that bad at all; especially for Deli food.  Overall, it was a good dining experience, and was further validated by the fact that 15 minutes later, the lunch crowd finally arrived and filled the place up in a hurry.  There was nothing negative about our experience at this place with the food or the staff. The only negative experience we had was having to endure the rude woman customer in front of us who went off on the server for giving her the bread that came with her meal! She yells at him stating \"Why are you giving me bread? Don't you know that I can't eat that?\"  No duh! It comes with your meal, and he doesn't know that you have food allergies as he can't read your microcephalic mind! I felt sorry for him as he looked flabbergasted as if someone high-fived his face.   I did say something in his defense, and yet she proceeded on down the line without even apologizing.  Aside from that, it was a great brunch overall!",

After a recent posting on yelp about my dining experience at Miracle Mile I was contacted by Josh,  Business Manager at Miracle Mile.  Josh and I spoke about my dining experience and at the end of our conversation I felt great. After my convesation with Josh I now know why Miracle Mile has been in the valley for over sixty years. A philosophy of tradition, pride, excellent customer service,and great food is why Miracle Mile stands out.  Customer Service, in my opinion, means exceeding  expectations. All of us  expect a certain level of service, and some expect more than others. However,  when a business EXCEEDS those expectations, it should be acknowledged and that is exactly what Miracle Mile has done, they exceeded my expectations.     In my oponion,  that is what I call the  \"WOW\" factor.  It's not often that I find myself saying \"WOW, I didn't expect that\" or \"that was beyond what I expected\" but thanks to Josh that is exactly what happened.    THANKS, again  Josh for caring about the experience your customers have at your restaurant and a special thanks for the gift card!",

Irish potato's and 2 slices of original rye bread. The portions are huge, the taste completely satisfied my craving for this little Irish lovely!!! They were in the Fox 10 Kitchen this week on AZAM.

This new location seems alot smaller than the previous one at Collenade Mall and certainly less parking.   The same staff is there to help out and serve you the best deli food in Phoenix.

I ordered the combo which is half corned beef half pastrami with Swiss cheese on a kaiser roll. The sandwich was huge and it came with a side of your choice. Meat was flavorful and I really loved the kaiser roll, soft and a little sweet. The fries were decent and I used the Yelp check in offer for a free side of mac n cheese which was just okay. My wife got their cranberry turkey sandwich that I was not a big fan of. Way too much cranberry sauce on the sandwich and overall didn't have much flavor. We also got their bread pudding which isn't really your standard bread pudding, the texture was almost like a flan, very custard like which I wasn't mad about, it was just different. This restaurant is huge, I wasn't really expecting it to be so big so I can imagine that this place gets packed during their peak hours but was almost empty when we went on a late Saturday night. If your looking for a good pastrami sandwich I would recommend it this place. Just not sure if I would recommend much else on the menu.",

    "text": "I enjoy eating in delis; I guess living in NYC and the surrounding areas for two decades has made me develop an appreciation for this genre of food. I'm glad that this deli does not disappoint. The dishes are deli staples, the servings are generous, and the prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity of food that you get - and you get the food fast because you make your choices from the already-prepared offerings in the large trays as you move through the queue.  The convenient location, bright and spacious interior, modern vibe, and friendly service all contribute to an overall pleasant and relaxed dining experience.",
