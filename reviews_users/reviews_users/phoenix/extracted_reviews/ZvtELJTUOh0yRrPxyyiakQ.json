Oregano's has solid food & friendly service. This is probably like the fourth or fifth location I've been to over the years (the other ones were in Scottsdale & Phoenix). Honestly, the one thing about Oregano's I remember not liking as much in the past was their pizza (they have really good pasta & salads), but pizza was what I ordered this time and it was really good! It was a veggie pizza with sun-dried tomatoes, feta, and I can't remember what else but it was really good. Everything tasted fresh. We opted for thin crust, which I had never had from Oregano's before (maybe that's why I liked it better?).  I like Oregano's. I like this location. I like the fact that the Phoenix area has a local chain like this that's successful.",

They actually give you two slices and it was delicious.  Very fresh ingredients and they stick with that.  No need to fancy it up.  Took a cool pic of the decor, an homage to The Godfather.

They have a pretty extensive menu, offering pizza, pasta, and salads. My wife loves the basic \"bowl-o-pasta\"- choose your pasta type and the sauce that covers it (meat sauce is great). I've always been fond of the Pablo Picasso salad. This time I ordered it seems as though it had changed a bit- they added diced (fresh) jalapenos so that adds a lot of extra heat (I don't remember that from previous versions of the salad). The portions are huge so bring an appetite- even the \"junior\" that I ordered was massive and basically unfinishable (new word).   There's a great menu for the kids, lots to choose from and a decent price. Oregano's always has great beers on tap and a decent wine menu. Our server was attentive but not stalking, and knew the menu well. We did order to baked ravioli and they were not very good. It tasted like it was all breading with a little bit of spicy cheese baked into the middle. I would skip those next time around.   With 2 adult meals, a glass of wine, a pint of beer, the app, a kids meal & a 20% tip we walked away $60 lighter. The restaurant is a little on the noisy side so be prepared to shout or simply stare at each other (they play Sinatra-themed music over the loudspeakers).   Good food, great service, full menu, and a decent drink menu keeps me coming back to Oregano's. They do offer good lunch menus, and can get them out to you quickly if you're in a rush. The lunch crowds are large here...",

The location on Elliott does not provide the same experience! On three occasions now the salads have had way too much dressing, even when one of the people I was dining with asked for less dressing on her main course chicken cesar salad after seeing what we got on our salads there was two maybe three times the amount of dressing that is on any other salad from other locations! So, you need to work on that big time! Now the second problem, the pizza at this location is not the same! The dough on the pizza does not taste the same and there for the pizza does not taste the same! And to top it if they undercook the pizza! So what you end up with is a pizza that tastes like something I tried to make at home! Doh! That's why I go out for pizza!  Please please! Get some upper management in this location, fast! If not, Oregano's is going down hill!",

I know it is a chain and you should only expect so much, however this was quite the let down. Here are my points: 1) service was very slow. It took 30 min. for a cheese pizza to come to the table 2) the cheese pizza we ordered looked as if it was made on a tortilla or possibly some sort of flat bread.  A big salad and 12 inch pizza should have filled my family of four up, however I found self scavenging for pizza bones. I almost asked the guy in the booth just next to me if I could share some of his meal.  Long and short of it is that the appeal is most likely to Chicago \"Transients\" who like deep dish pizza and I swore off \"Pizza Hut\" years ago.  I knew I should not have passed up a slice of pepperoni from Costco for the crackers and cheese from here.",

All of the Oreganos have a great patios and this one in particular actually has a very large indoor dining room as well for those of you who prefer the inside. My personal favorite here is the Italian gold wings, the honey mustard BBQ sauce is so delicious that I almost always order these as the main dish. Oh and lets not forget the oh so cheesy garlic bread that is about the length of my who arm it is so tasty... We also love the meatball sandwich and if you like chicken caesar salads you have to try theirs it is topped with shaved chicken that has such great flavor its definitely better than your typical grilled chicken most restaurants have. Overall this is one of my favorite spots for an afternoon lunch when the weather is nice so we can enjoy the patio and don't forget to try their peach bellini !!!",

    "text": "I have been to other locations and have had good experiences, but lunch today was not a good experience.  The hostess did not seem to be very skilled at managing the seating and we ended up having to wait for a table much longer than we should have.  The food was good but when our waitress refilled my drink, it tasted like a diet drink, so i asked her if I could get the regular soda that I had originally.  Immediately after I asked her, I heard the guy at the next table tell her that his re-filled diet drink tasted like regular soda.  She had taken the sodas to be refilled at the same time and had obviously mixed them up.  It is bad enough that I drank from the straw that another person had been using (gross), but then the waitress rushed back with new drinks and told us that the syrup was out and that is why my drink tasted funny, not because she had given me the wrong drink.  I have tasted drinks before when the syrup is low, and it doesn't make it taste like diet soda.  She lied to me.  I wish I had spoken to the manager, but I just wanted to go because I was grossed out.  I will never go to this restaurant again  Update: Customer service from the restaurant contacted me after my posting and apologized and offered to send me something to make up for my experience and encourage me to try them again.  Well, I sent my address but never got anything from them, so another BIG FAIL from Oreganos.  Hard to believe that they treat their customers this way.",

    "text": "As a native Chicagoan, I can safely say that Oregano's is the best pizza in AZ - on-par with or better than most Chicago offerings.  Having been to (and impressed by) the University - Tempe restaurant, we thought we'd give this location a try.  Arrived at about 1 PM on a Saturday and there was a line . . . so we opted for the \"sit at the bar\" alternative.  The bartender was extremely pleasant - and that's what made up for her \"just OK\" service.  Food took a while to arrive - but, again, they were packed to the gills.  Meatballs with cheese and sauce were better than those at the University location.  Italian Gold wings were huge and delicious.  BBQ Chicken pizza (thin crust) was PHENOMENAL . . . better than any equivalents I've had in Chicago.  Sauce is top-notch and cheese is not greasy at all!  And the Chocolate Chip Cookie Pizza was delicious without question.  We had a very pleasant, delicious experience and will definitely be back.  One point:  the pizzas are not cheap.  $18 for a12\" thin-crust with just one topping.  Which would be a bit of crime in Chicago.  We took it in-stride based on the ambiance, taste, and experience.  I will echo other reviews when I say, \"don't expect white-glove service\" from the wait staff, but this was definitely not a deal-breaker.  PS:  the parking situation is a head-and-shoulders improvement above their other locations!",

It took about 35 minutes to reach our table, but the wait was definitely worth it. (The waitress advised that it may take up to an hour so the early arrival was a huge bonus!) Everything from the cheese, the sauce, and the crust was absolutely wonderful. During the wait, we had some of their meatballs as an appetizer. They weren't just your average meatballs either. These meatballs were so good that I could have had an entire meal off of them alone and have walked out fully satisfied. Whenever we eat pizza (at other places), I can usually polish off a few slices, but one slice of Oregano's deep dish pizza was certainly filling enough.  We ended up with a few days of leftover pizza, but that was of course a very good thing. Every employee here was very nice too (even the ones who weren't serving us.) For instance, on my way to the men's room, several employees said \"hello.\"  I will definitely be back!",

I asked for an extra side of marina sauce because the meatball sub has none on it. I was not told that I would be charged for it. This is really tacky in my opinion. At least tell people they will be charged. Perhaps if you put some sauce on the sandwich I wouldn't have to ask for it! Anyhow, I did end up getting a free pizza cookie for signing up for their loyalty program. We thoroughly enjoyed that.  So, the cheesiness (no pun intended) is what is stopping a 5 star rating. That and the slow service. I guess that's just how they roll at Oregano's. We didn't even order pizza! The Queen Creek location is slow too. I did make my opinion known to the manager to which she apologized and blamed the minimum wage increase. Really? Excuses? Most employees in restaurants don't even make minimum wage so that excuse doesn't fly with me.  I'll end up going back because I like the food, but tell me ahead of time if you're going to charge me extra. It's the point of the matter. It's not the cost.",

    "text": "Opting in to the Deep Dish Pizza with the 1 hour wait- DISCLAIMER was definitely the biggest let-down ever. For such an extensive  wait, it's fair to assume that you are ordering something made-to-order and done to perfection... Not in this case. For starters, the appropriate description for this failure should be \"would you like a doughy crust with your cheese explosion\". There was easily over 36 ounces of cheese mixed with uncooked peppers and onions and a small portion of protein tucked under the cheese bed, then tomato paste slathered over the top.   My family made the decision to go to dinner because we were hungry. The bar was raised a notch when we opted in to the hour pizza. It was such a bust that 2 bites in, we began brainstorming on how we could put it in our new-wave oven at home and cook it till the doughy crust was done, but would that mean the raw peppers and onions mixed in with the cheese would be done too? Wait a second here, that's why we came out to dinner... for the Oreganos chefs to do that part.   Result: Manager confirmed that the pizza was definitely undercooked (as he slipped the spatula under the pizza and played with the floppy crust). He then apologized and offered dessert on the house. The peanut butter cookie topped with ice-cream was a tasty dinner replacement.",

    "text": "This review is for the location on Elliot Rd in Tempe, however a lot of my comments apply to the entire chain.  I've been to Oregano's many times since moving to the Phoenix area, and up until recently it was my favorite pizza place in the valley.  However since they have changed their menu things have really seemed to go downhill.    The menu variety has been reduced drastically, many of the items that were my favorites are not even available any more (Chipotle Chicken Club Pizza, I'm looking at you).  No doubt this was to cut down on food cost, but the result is that a lot of the things that made Oregano's great no longer exist.    The execution of the menu items that they do have has been inconsistent for me the last three or four visits.  Today at the Elliot location the stuffed pizza that we ordered came out way overdone, the crust was pretty burnt.  Anybody that has ordered one of these pizzas before knows that they take nearly an hour to prepare.  There was no way we were going to send it back and wait another hour for a replacement.  Unfortunately issues like this seem to be becoming common for the chain.    I could go on with issues seen during previous recent visits, but the bottom line is that there are too many good pizza places around to spend any more time with this one.  I no longer recommend the chain, and probably will not return.",

Have to admit, I usually don't trust the recommendations of people I don't know directly, but they were right about Oreganos.  -The place was absolutely packed on Thursday night, one sign of how popular the place must be, especially with the locals.  -The service was prompt and courteous.  We were never left too long without being checked upon.  Their \"Legalize Marinara\" t-shirts also helped keep my wife entertained because she thought they were taking a stance and legalizing MARIJAUNA... which was highly entertaining  -Now to the best part, the food. Our friends got the Chicago stuffed pizza, which had a wait time of 45 minutes, but was so worth the wait.  One of the best pizza's I have ever seen, tasted, smelled, etc.  My wife and I split one of their salads, which was huge!  It was also very good, not quite CPK good, but close.  -In summary, if you are looking for good food in a casual atmosphere give Oreganos a try!",

I ordered hot wings and didn't like them. The place is nice enough that. They didn't charge me for the wings so hospitality and service wise this place is amazing. Atmosphere is great and have had great wait-staff.   Now this time around I came back because a friend had just started working there and told me to come in for a 2nd try. Told me to get something other than the wings. So this time I tried the brechetta (didn't spell that right huh?) and that was pretty good. Nothing special but good. Got the margarita pizza pan style and it was good but again nothing special. Then we got dessert. The highlight of the evening was that freakin cookie. It was so delicious. The cookie was baked fresh so it was still warm and soft yet crispy with ice cream on top. The combination of the fresh warm cookie with cold ice cream was amazing. I thought I was full with the food I had ate but once I had a bite of the cookie I was digging in like I hadn't eaten a thing.   So overall I don't understand what the big hype about the food is because its \"ok\" food for me. Its good but does not live up to what other people have told me about this place. On the other hand I will be returning for a drink and that cookie again.",

They've got some okay pasta and some nice sandwiches, but if anything, you want to hit this place up for the Pizza Cookie dessert, which IS a party in your mouth: half-baked cookie dough with a dollop of ice cream on top in a pizza deep dish. It's fantastic.   I'm also partial to some of their salads. Great theme and ambiance, and the college-aged staff makes an effort not to seem too much like college-aged staff.   However, it's crowded and loud, which is a nice environment if you're just hanging with friends or on a date with the wife. Bringing kids is a bit of a nightmare because of the long wait times and the claustrophobic rage it puts my kids into. They do give the kids a coloring thing and a lob of pizza dough to play with. Great touches, but just touches. It's like trying to put out a forest fire with a truckload of water. It'll help for all of a minute, and in the end you still have to clean up the truck wreckage.",

    "text": "In my absence on Yelp for a couple months, I went traveling. So here is Oregano's Pizza Bistro. It's one of quite a few in Arizona, and I very honestly wish I could take it back to California with me.  The portions here are huuuge. Actually, probably huge for a person like me, but pretty normal when you think about restaurant portions. The water glasses here are like a third larger than regular water glasses!  The Boom Dip: Really delicious piping hot spinach and artichoke dip, served with \"Italian chips\". This is definitely something to share with your friends! The Italian chips were HUGE and crisp on the outside but soft enough on the inside. It made a great pair.  Bistro Sweet Po's: I have a soft spot in my heart for sweet potato fries. I will try them anywhere! Oregano's served them with a sprinkling of cinnamon and a tangy aioli. A good sweet and salty combination.  My first time at Oregano's, I got the Big Rig Pasta. That thing was huge! But also delicious. The cream sauce paired well with the fresh diced tomatoes and I loved the spice. My second time, I got the Alfredo The Dark. It took my favorite sauce and added a twist - this shit is spicy, dude. Spicy seems to be something they favor here as a few pasta items on their menu have spice. If you get the Bollo Pasta, they say it's \"spicy\", but it isn't really. The sauce is very different than your run of the mill marinara though, in a good way. I would recommend it if you're going for something simple for lunch.  Others might find the decor and environment very kitschy - commercials from decades past play on the televisions inside, the menu covers are old album covers, and everything is styled to be very retro. The backs of the staff t-shirts will make you laugh. I find it all amusing. What I didn't find amusing was how long it took for food to come out - they were always busy when we went. Other than that though, my experience with Oregano's was very pleasant.",

This makes this place amazing for groups. The service is also pretty great with the waiters on top of refills and any needs we had.",

Now I'm stuck with a pizza we didn't order and they wanted me to stay an extra 30 minutes to get the pizza we ordered. No thanks. Why not just listen to what people order instead of taking the liberty to add things to pizzas when people don't order it that way. Save yourself some dang tomatoes.",

    "text": "I was told about this place by some friends and so I had to check it out for myself. I had high expectations since everybody at my work told me about how great this Oregano's was. It was my first time there and service was real slow, my family and I ordered pizza, pasta and wings (that took like 40 min to arrive).  I walked in, was greeted and got seated right away. So I asked the waiter about a few thing on the menu that I could eat and I settled on the spaghetti with a Caesar salad. There was a bunch of fun, young servers. My server was Colin, who was efficient and friendly. This location of Oregano's was very clean and the servers were polite; it seems to be run by management that keeps a tight ship. The location was decorated in a fun and modern way, with multiple decorations hanging from the walls and ceiling. I was seated about a half hour before they were closing, and the staff was happy to serve my group past 10 pm, when the doors are normally shut.   I would have preferred more dressing on the salad, but I should have asked for some more at the time. The spaghetti was delicious and came smothered in a spicy red sauce and grilled chicken. The pasta bowl was somewhat small, but filled me up with my salad and an order of cheesy bread. The menu contained a variety of build-your-own pasta choices, which looked delicious, along with a section of pizzas. My friend ordered a personal pepperoni and sausage pizza that looked delicious. I did not look at the dessert options on their menu but was told that they offer desserts. Their drink menu was expansive and offered many options of beer, wine, and cocktails. I ordered a soda and received it nearly immediately.   The food was a bit pricey for my budget as it wasn't a huge upgrade over a less expensive option like Olive Garden or Chompies. I spent almost thirty dollars on my meal, splitting one appetizer and ordering a pasta and side salad. However, if I had only got a pasta and drink, my meal would have been almost half the price, making Oreganos a good option for individuals with varying budgets.  This Oregano's has the best service and the food was delicious! Our server was great and provided refills as needed.  I would say out of all the locations, this one is probably the best one! I would recommend over and over and find myself coming  back several times a week for the ambiance and servers who treat you like friends and not just customers! Oregano's is a really good alternative to other chains. It is not really a destination restaurant, but the food is good and not having to wait to eat on a Sunday afternoon is priceless. Oreganos is a good sit down experience for people like myself who usually eat out at chains.",

The manager offered to discount the pizza, which I thought was odd - so I asked for it to be comped, which in my mind is correct in principle, and she obliged. Considering I was bringing out of town guests this was a lackluster experience and we're a little too grossed out to come back for quite some time. That's a bummer because I love their stuffed pizzas and our usual server is really nice.",

The lunch specials are awesome and you can get a cheap slice of pizza and a salad with quick service. I would come in on a weekend night and have dinner and drinks with my gf and have a blast. We would usually order parmesan lime wings for appetizer with wine and beer to start. Then we would split an order of Alfredo the Dark with chicken.",

    "text": "I heard a joke once before ... they're not mad, they're just hot! And I use this to describe the customer service we received at lunch the other week. Our waitress didn't smile once while we were there. Just zero pizzazz. And it wasn't even 11:30 am yet for her to have a bad day, at least I don't think so. But at least she was nice? When our drink orders came, my co-worker ordered a sierra mist, only to find some black crud in his cup. Our waitress did apologize and came back with a new one for him.  Other than that, the food is good there. Good enough that my co-workers come to this restaurant all the time.  I ordered the O'zone Special of the day which was the Especial. But if we wanted to know what's in it, per the waitress, look it up under the hot sandwiches...hahaha.  I ain't making this up. That's exactly what she told us. Although it was the o'zone special of the day, it seemed it was their regular sized calzone. I could only eat half of the calzone! And it tasted pretty good. And honestly, I have had better calzone and far better customer service.   As always, I'm happy to change my rating with an improved experience.",

I think only two times we had issues.    Now for this trip to this location.  We spent most of the afternoon purchasing a new car. We were hungry and this place was on the way home.  Knowing the good reputation for Oreganos we stopped by for some solid pizza.  This is how it went good for me and bad for the better half.  We got there and there was a wait of about 10 - 20 minutes.  We ordered a deep dish sausage and peperoni.  I asked if would be okay to have a stuff tonight.  She said no because she does not like stuffed.  I said okay put the order in.  We sit down order some yummy meatballs while we wait.  Then the pizza comes and it looks different.  She said this is different here.  They brought us a stuffed pizza and I am like hell yea.  She was like hell no.  Something happen and the hostess did a stuffed.  I did not care what happen because I prefer stuffed over deep.  I was in heaven.  The pizza was really good and yummy.  I ate just 1 1/2 slices and took the rest home.  It was good.  I will have the other slices tonight.    Like I said this place is really good.  You should try it.",

We usually go for special occasions like birthdays, graduations, etc. The workers always have a smile on their face and have great customer service. The portions are quite large but its always great to take home some left overs which the waiter/waitress do themselves. The atmosphere is always friendly and pleasant. It is always clean and they play music throughout the restaurant. Also the servers are always communicative and interact with the customers well.  The food is astounding. Every time I go I get the Alfredo the Dark which is delicious. It is a spiral pasta with creamy sauce and diced tomatoes topped with a jalapeno. it also comes with their 'south of the border' bread. For dessert I get the pizza cookie with ice cream on top. All in all, I think that Oregano's is just amazing and the best place to eat.",

I inquired about a to-go order this morning for the next day, lunch time. They requested I place the order the day before but did not say it was required. Later that day, I called to place my order to pick up the next day and I was told they couldn't accommodate my request because they had \"too many orders\" for that time and could not take my to-go order because it was \"too large\". I was never told during my inquiry phone call that there was a certain number of to-go slots and that I risked not being able to place a to-go order if I waited too long. The manager, Alicia, stated it \"didn't happen that often\" so their staff wasn't instructed to disclose that on the phone. Additionally, no one was able to tell me what designated a to-go order as \"large\" making it impossible to know in the future what is considered a large or a small order. I am disappointed with the complete lack of customer service and total disorganization of this establishment. If I were placing a catering order, I could understand. But not a to-go order because it was \"too large,\" which apparently is an undefinable term at this Oregano's location.",

    "text": "I have been to many Oregano's around town but this one is by far the worst one yet.  Took the family to eat lunch on a weekday.  We ordered the calamari, order of hot wings, and a stuffed pizza.  When the drink order came, our waitress (some big chested short blonde lady) forgot the lemons to the water.  When one of us asked if we could get lemons for the passion fruit tea, the waitress curtly replied, \"We don't put lemons in passion fruit tea.\"  When asked to get some any way, she begrudgingly went and got some for the tea.   The calamari... disappointment.  The calamari itself was okay, but I didn't expect the best.  The problem was the lack of portion.  There wasn't enough to even cover the plastic plate it was served on.  Just some scattered about on a large plastic plate.  If the portions are going to be this small, at least put it on a smaller plate to make it LOOK LIKE the portions are larger.  Just try a little bit harder.  The hot wings... good.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The stuffed pizza... first, if you are a regular at Oregano's you know that stuffed pizza take a long time, but generally they are worth it.  Not this time.  When we got our pizza, the pizza crust was thin as paper.  Worst of all, the ENTIRE bottom was burnt!  Not just spots of burnt crust... THE ENTIRE BOTTOM CRUST was BURNT.  The time we were there, we saw our original waitress (big chested short haired blonde) twice.  Then I saw her leave and not say bye or let us know she was leaving.  So we did not get to see another waiter for awhile.  When we finally got our bill, I was very surprised.  They charged $2 for some jalapenos we had asked for.  It was billed as extra toppings for the pizza, but the jalapenos weren't enough to cover a large stuffed pizza.  That was my last straw, I hate getting nickeled and dimed out of little things like extra condiments or pickles.  I really wanted to like this place since it is the closet to our home, but I will not be going back.",

Why would a manager go down the row to greet the first table next to us, skip our table, then go to the third table next to us? Is it company policy to only greet white guests? I asked him about it and he seemed surprised that he had done that. Perhaps it's so ingrained that he ignore certain customers that he didn't realize it. Luckily, our waiter was more attentive.",

    "text": "Pretty upset with the service we received the other day around 3pm at this specific Oregano's.(We go to different Oregano's often.) We walked in and sat at the bar, waited 5MIN just for the bar tender to say \"you guys want to go and sit at a table?\" We were both confused but went and sat at a table in the other room from the bar. We thought maybe she was behind on work, so We waited about 10 more MIN for our new server to ask what we would like to drink, waited another 15MIN for our drinks and at this point we were ready to order. My boyfriend got \"The Big Rig\" pasta and I got a slice of cheese pizza. The waitress finally brought out my bfs pasta after 30MIN, she didn't offer any fresh Parmesan cheese for his pasta, and just told me she will be right back with my slice of pizza and walked away. We sat there for another 25MIN!! My bf was pretty much finished with his pasta (which he said was great) but we had no idea where our waitress was. My bf looked around the room and saw her taking a order for a 15 top-table.. I didn't receive my pizza for another 15MIN. She finally brought my slice of cheese pizza to the table but my bf was finished with his pasta and we were both ready to leave at this point. I advised our waitress in a polite way that I no longer wanted the slice of cheese pizza and that I had waited over an hour for that slice. She grunted, walked away, didn't care to apologize for the 1 hour wait for a slice of pizza, didn't even care to try to accommodate and leave the slice and say \"it's on the house\" or anything apologetic and just brought us the check. We then paid with cash, she didn't bring us our change for another 20MIN, we were unsure if she knew how to count money. This was the worst service I've ever had. My boyfriend and I agreed to never go to this Oregano's again.",

Today the vote was for Oregano's, I personally had not tried them up until now, but I always see that the place is pack!   I looked at the menu we had floating around here at the office and I saw they have Midday Rush Menu items from 11am to 3pm Mon to Friday, and I have to say they have a nice variety to pick from.   I went with the Bollo Pasta; it was a bowl of pasta, crazy right??  It was angel hair pasta cooked perfectly paried with a spicy marinara sauce, and it came with a slice of garlic bread.  It was a perfectly delish lunch, guess I now have Oregano's to add to my lunch time list!",

I do enjoy it as well, but it IS spicy.  I typically can't have a biteful without burning up.  My favorite go to is the Big Rig pasta.  We also love their pizzas and their thin crust.  This location is very convenient for us and has great parking space, unlike the location in Tempe and Mesa. I do wish that they had more dry towels for cleaning up.  Every time we go in, they will clean off a table for us, and leave it wet and sticky.  We always have to get someone to come back and wipe it dry for us.  I would be nice to have it dry as a regular thing to do when cleaning off a table.  But other than that, I really have nothing bad to say!",

It was my first time there and service was real slow, my family and I ordered pizza, pasta and wings (that took like 40 min to arrive).   The staff was friendly and corteous, they would check on us every now and then, but when my plate came in (Alfredo the Dark) which I ordered without meat, it came with 2 meatballs, I told my server and she took cake of it, I was really hungry by that time and when i tasted my pasta it was so flavorless and plain, apart from being cold. It was dissapointing because I read this delicious description on the menu.  Pizza and wings where delicious tho, and so the cookie pizza my niece got for her Bday! Might try again someday.",

As much as I would like to review this place a bit more thoroughly (customer service, dine-in experience, facilities, etc). My overly satisfied taste buds wanted to go ahead and rate them now!  Their pizza is really, really good. I'm a die hard pizza lover, and I have had my fair share of assorted pizzas, from frozen to fast food chains, to actual gourmet pizzas at restaurants.  All I can say is, Oregano's pizza is on a class of it's own. And for me, that's very important with pizza; to have their own distinct flavor. It's so good in fact, that even if someone gave me pizza in an unmarked box, I would be able to tell it's Oregano's.  Now, I am no food critic. But their pizza makes me want to be one; Just for the moment at least.  Their bread and crust is nice, thin, crunchy, and flaky at just the right level. You can also taste the creaminess of the mozzarella cheese, with the impact of that deli-licious pepperoni slices. And the best part is, the marinara sauce isn't drenched and is \" volume\"d out perfectly.  If it comes to the pizza I have no complaints. I would really look forward to getting a chance to dine-in and try their pastas.  Kudos Oregano's",

Since I really have no idea where to go I Yelp eating joints the vicinity and Oregano's pops up. We pull up at dinner time and are expecting chaos or at least a really busy place but it wasn't, we were seated right away. Our waitress comes over right away and starts our drinks, I order a pint of beer which she hurriedly brings and it's ice cold and delicious. Because we've never been here we can't really decide what to order, it all sounds great. We wanted to try the wedding soup and our waitress brought us a sample and it was amazing. We finally decide on our dinner order and we try the Italian wedding soup, the Chicago Italian Sausage sandwich with sweet potato fries and the Big Rig Pasta with chicken, As we wait for our order we check out the place and it's amazing, there's a lot of decor all over the place which makes it cozy and interesting, there's old school tunes playing (Sinatra, Rat pack) making the place seem cool and relaxing. The noise level is relatively low considering how many people were in there and how much is going on around you.",

    "text": "We ordered from here through DoorDash last night. It was so awful. We used to LOVE Oregano's, but it was just so bad the last few times we've tried, so last night will be our last time. It took over TWO HOURS for us to get our food. We saw the original wait time was 70 minutes, so we definitely expected a wait... just not a two hour wait. Not DoorDash's fault at all... 100% Oregano's fault. When we finally received our order, they forgot my husband's potatoes, our Garlic Cheese bread, and marinara sauce. Just straight up not included at all. The food was not cooked well. The Big Rig with chicken which is my favorite was so bad! It had no flavor and no sauce. We ordered the Boom Dip and the bowl was swimming in about an inch of oil, and the bread they provided wasn't cooked. They used to be a great restaurant. Now they are trash. Eat ANYWHERE else besides here.",

Those small two seater booths are ridiculous. The hostess should know better than to sit bigger people there. I hosted for many years and there were always those tables you knew about. The waitress was friendly but nothing spectacular. We right away ordered the boom dip because we were starving after a 45 minute wait and it came with the rest of our food instead of first. The food was good but the boom dip was so oily and the chicken parm was barely seasoned with little sauce. The noodles had no sauce on them so it was like eating butter noodles with no butter... The wings were not completely cooked and the Mac and cheese was so hot it burned my husband's mouth. I don't know. I love this restaurant and will be back but likely not this location. I hope it was just an off night for you tonight.",

This location is more spacious than the University location and the wait wasn't too long only ten minutes.   We learned last time that deep dish can take 40 min to make fresh in their ovens. When waiting in line you can put in your order.  Our 12\" deep dish we decided to top with sausage, green pepper and mushrooms.  When our Deep dish pizza in the pan was served to us it had plenty of cheese and marinara. I really enjoyed the crust in the pan (you don't  have to be shy about dipping the crust in your sauce because this pizza place is that good!) Our server was also very nice and attentive. They deserve all the stars for great food memories! We will be back to visit this location.",

First off I order tea he doesnt ask if we want black or the other kind, then It all started when I ordered a Pablo picazzo salad without contijo cheese (unpasteurized cheese is a NO NO for pregnant people), his demeanor changed and was a bit pissed off! So he brought the salad and i could see small white crumbled cheese so then I asked again, if he is sure there is no unpasteurized cheese he was visibly pissed took the plate and went to kitchen and drop the food says YOUR GOOD! Then NOT EVEN ONCE did he ask us if everything came out ok , he just brought our food as it came which i ordered (large pablo picasso salad, italian gold wings, kids pizza, calamari and to go pan pizza numero uno).. NO REFILLS ON DRINKS(we asked for a to go tea that was my refill). He also didnt ask us if we want ranch or blue cheese just assumed that we want ranch.. my husband was livid and he wanted to not give him a tip which i refuse our total was 69.67  dollars i gave him 12 bucks since the pizza was to go anyway and I didnt want to be an asshle even though we received the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE!! i told the Manager and the front desk ... I just hope they use it as a learning opportunity!!!I hope they remember that people dont ask for no reason, its a safety concern and if lets say something happened to my unborn child ? it will come back to the company .",

The pizza was excellent and the only thing we'd have changed if possible, was to leave room for one of the great desserts!

Just make sure you have more than two people in your group before trying this appetizer otherwise you won't be able to eat anything else.

So I leave feeling guilty for the calories and bummed I didn't just get the Zany Ziti, Big Ol Ravioli or the Penne Pasta Bake.    Great service, always very quick during the lunch hour, clean establishment, the ambiance isn't as nice as the one in Gilbert but it's still a nice place to eat.",

    "text": "Since our daughter moved to Tempe, wife and I will take the hour drive to see her once in awhile! So, the wife, our two foster daughters and I packed up and hauled to Tempe. One of the reason why I moved out of SoCal, was traffic. One of the reason why I hate Tempe, is traffic. Anyway, the main reason why we took the trip. So our daughter could meet the foster kids for the first time.  We have been wanting to try Oregano's, so we decided to try this location out. One thing I have noticed since we have had our foster kid's are trying to find a place where they like the food. They are not use to restaurants, they love fast foods. So we were seated, ordered our drinks quickly, and a cheese bread appetizer. Their cheese bread was amazing if you like garlic! Our six yr old had the kids meal cheese pizza, our seven yr old was the tough one. She was acting like she didn't want to eat there. Knowing that she like spicy food, I ordered hot wings and a large pepperoni pizza half with jalapenos. Our daughter had the chicken Parmesan, and wife had the penne pesto. I can tell the six year old enjoyed the food, WHY! She ate her whole personal pizza, had two hot wings,sampled the wife's penne, and daughters parmesan!  The seven year old did like the pizza, and hot wings. I myself thought the food was good. I did request the pizza to be well done, like the crust crispy. However the waiter advised not to since their crust is extra thin and will burn the crust. After getting the pizza, wished they would have cooked it longer.  We had a great time, the girls loved our daughter, food was good. Now for the cons! We felt the waiter was rushing us through out our time there? We were not ever half way done with our food and he was already asking us about dessert, and boxes for our food? And prices, I,m OK with shelling out hundred dollars for dinner. This place just doesn't seem to be a place I would enjoy spending that kind of money. This is why I almost gave this place a 3-star review. But the overall experience we had, was well worth it. We had fun, girls enjoyed the dinner.",

If you submit feedback, in my case I literally asked if there was something else I should've done regarding the food I barely ate due to it being drowned in dressing and why I was still charged, no one cares. If you're gonna put on big boy pants and run a legitimate business, chances are, your guests actually matter as does their satisfaction. If that's something that you are incapable or unwilling to do, maybe look into another profession. Until then, this concept is just another entitled Mom and Pop shop. I'll happily give my money to another establishment. And to think, all you had to do was reply to one of my emails. It's sad that this is how you operate and that you're ok with it.",

    "text": "10/14/16 Yelp Review Oregano's Pizza Bistro 1475 W Elliot Rd Tempe, AZ 85284 (480) 966-0401 My fiance and a few friends of ours were getting together for dinner and decided to go to Oregano's. This was not the first time I've ever been to Oregano's but it was my first time at this particular location. Our friends got there a bit early and were already seated by the time we got there, which is always a plus. The staff, from the front door to the server to our waiter were kind and welcoming, making our experience overall very pleasant. Our waiter checked on us periodically, but not too much where it felt like a bother. He made sure that we all had what we needed, our drinks were full, and our food was to our liking.  The best part of our experience though had to be the food! Our friends ordered wings for an appetizer, which arrived quickly and looked delicious. Our friends proceeded to rave about how good they were. I am not a wings person myself, but have heard that the way they grill their wings and the rub they use is superior to many other wings. Our waiter then took our entree orders and checked on us regularly until they arrived. I myself ordered the Big Rig pasta, which I have never tried before. It might have been the best pasta I have ever tasted. The dish had rigatoni noodles in a creamy tomato sauce with shredded chicken. It also had a little kick of spices which I wasn't expecting, but was pleasantly surprised. Overall, the food was absolutely divine! My fiance, who always orders the Vino Bambino salad, tried my dish and even tried to convince me to trade dishes because the Big Rig was so good! Not to say that his Vino Bambino wasn't delicious, it most certainly was, but the Big Rig was simply top notch and definitely a dish I plan to order again in the future. Our friends ordered a pizza to share and were also very satisfied with their meal.  The ambiance of Oregano's makes it a fun environment to sit and chat without being too loud, so even after our meals to done we stayed for a bit just to chat. The music played throughout the restaurant is upbeat music, seemingly from the 1950s era which transports you back to a simpler time. Our waiter was very courteous and didn't rush us to leave or pay our bill. Speaking of the bill, we had excellent food, excellent service, and even some food to take home for a reasonable price. I believe our total came to around $30 and we had no problem tipping 20% because the wait staff was very kind and helpful. Overall, I'm a loyal Oregano's fan. It is one of our families go-to restaurant for family events. But I have to say that this location might be my favorite simply because of the staff and wonderful experience we had there. We will without a doubt be back to this location and many other Oregano's throughout the valley soon.",

The service was OK, the meatball sub wasn't as good as the hubs remembered it being at other places and my veggie sub was quite nice.  I'd never had it before so I can't compare but I enjoyed - just not lovvvved it.  I do thoroughly enjoy going to Oregano's but if there's another location you can go to, I would.  We were in the area for our staycation so that's why we went here.",

    "text": "I came in for the first time with my parents for a late lunch a couple weeks ago and it struck me as odd that the only seating options inside were booths or high-top tables. No regular tables?? What if I don't want to be jammed inside a booth, or have to sit with my ass raised four feet in the air with a dress on? Right. Okay, should have gone somewhere else if I wanted a normal table-chair set up.   Anyway, after I scooted 10 feet across the booth, we were greeted by a waitress with a terrible artificial red short hair color job who seemed nice, but really dense..kind of like the pizza! We decided to share some toasted ravioli, a salad, and a pan style numero-whatever they call it pizza. I originally asked for the stuffed version, but she indicated that particular pizza takes approximately 45 minutes to bake.   Who has 45 minutes to sit around in a booth waiting for a pizza? Lesson: We would have appreciated that information right off that bat upon receiving menus.   Anyway, the toasted ravioli was a great starter, something savory-crunchy-cheesy to set the tone for the pizza- I definitely recommend it. And then out came this ENORMOUS FREAKING salad. The three of us just stared at it, and then attempted, with zero success, to portion it out without making a mess. By the time we each finished, there was salad debris all over the table, and half remaining on the plate. And looking back, it really wasn't that great.  Mom: Is this the smallest size they have??? Me: I think so, I didn't ask for the big one.  -Enter waitress from stage left with pizza: How's the salad guys? Me: Um, we're going to need a box, I'm surprised this is the smaller size. Waitress (with deer in headlights stare): Oh! Uhum... this is the larger size, I'm sorry I didn't know you wanted to smaller one!  Me (annoyed): Why would you just assume that we wanted the larger one?  At that point it had been 30 minutes since we ordered and I just wanted some mf'ing pizza. And it was good...great actually...but not the best. The toppings were fresh, sauce portion was just right, and cheese was everywhere.   Aside from the assuming service, I would come back again for the pizza, or just order ahead. I didn't cover the bill so I don't know if we got charged the large salad price, but if we did, and I ever see that waitress again, I would bluntly ask for someone else and state why. Obviously the waitress put a huge damper on my first experience here, so hopefully it will improve in the future.",

The fried calamari was pleasurable and held me over in the wait for the pizza. My biggest complaint is that it does take a considerable amount of time to prepare the pizza (not something you can get around, so come when you have time). The pizza was fantastically delicious. They use a great quality cheese, the marinara sauce was good, and the quantity is definitely appropriate to price. Would recommend and will come again.",

Our drinks tasted watered down, and for $6.99 a piece, we expect a little more. The serving size, which is usually really large (at least at the Gilbert location) was much smaller. Our server, Taylor, was not very attentive and asked my obviously NOT under aged husband for his ID. It took quite a while just to get our drinks be we were not asked at all if we wanted dessert. We felt very rushed. Over-all, not the best experience.",

    "text": "BACKGROUND   My trainer told me that I need to eat more fresh veggies. I told him that I don't hate veggies, I just hate how they taste when I cook them. I always wind up cooking them via steamer and they're always too bland. So my trainer took me to Oregano's.   THE STORY  My trainer couldn't stop praising Oregano's salads, so we went. When we walked in, it looked and felt like a corporate restaurant chain, with heavy \"flair\" decor, like a TGI Friday's or Chili's.   There were two hostesses who said it was fine to sit at the bar.   My trainer ordered us a chef's salad with a side skillet of fresh broccoli. Both were DELICIOUS!!  I had no idea this place existed, and apparently, Oregano's is known for their huge salads!   Since then, I have been back and have tried their Cesar salad, mixed salad with chicken on top and the beefstro.  Each salad is HUGE (see pics). Heaps of lettuce and meat all seasoned to perfection. The farm skillets are AMAZING! I love the sauteed mixed veggies skillet and the broccoli skillet.  I usually just pop in for the salads. But I do like to glance at everyone else's food, which looks fantastic!  Today I tried dessert: The original pizza cookie, which is more than a 1/2 pound of white chocolate and macadamia nut cookie dough, half baked in a 6\" pizza pan with vanilla ice cream on top. SUPER YUMMY!! (see pic)  ABOUT OREGANO's  According to their website, Oregano's says it's a family restaurant from Chicago, based on grandma's own recipes. I'm not sure if that's the truth. It looks like a chain, similar to TGI Fridays, or Chili's. It seems that grandma hasn't been in the picture in years and years, assuming there was a grandma.  SERVICE EXPERIENCE  There is always a bunch of fun, young servers. Today, my server was Colin, who was efficient and friendly. This location of Oregano's is always clean and the servers are always polite; it seems to be run by management that keeps a tight ship.  CONCLUSION  Oregano's salads are legendary. Oregano's is always clean and well kept. The staff is hip but not overly talkative.   I'm definitely coming back!  It's 4/5 \"Phoenix Stars\" equivalent to 3/5 International.  4/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Hours: Monday-Sunday 11am-10pm  *The is plenty of parking.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Foreganos.com&s=fb8fa92840f354f17b5cd27d2cfd72efbfb9504f91ec388cc20ed13fe9b523ff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">oreganos.com</a>",

Then it took 50 minutes for our food to even get here in the first place.   Our food was cold and the waitress wasn't even remotely sorry about it when we told her. Literally didn't even say sorry.  When asked to speak to the manager, the manager came to us and offered to make us new entrees. By that time, our appetites were gone.  I am disgusted with how we were treated. It is unacceptable to treat paying customers- or people In general- this way. Will not be returning.",

I was so delighted and impressed today when our waitress brought out pizza dough for the kids to play with while they waited. Whoever thought of this is a genius. My three-year-old is often challenging to eat out with but he was captivated today. Crayons are old news but the dough was so cool to him. He also gobbled up more spaghetti than I have ever gotten him to eat at home. You have won us again oregano's!",

    "text": "This Oregano's location is like the Anti-Oregano's of the Phoenix area.  It is very spacious, there's a lot of available parking, and when I was here there wasn't a long wait for seating.  The food is like any other Oregano's location: Tasty with large portions.  I'm still a bit dubious of the notion of \"Chicago thin-crust pizza,\" when I'm so used to Chicago deep dish, and also the fact that the pizza looks like a St. Louis style Imo's Pizza with different cheese.  But, no matter what you get, rest assured you won't leave starving!    I've had pizzas, pizookies, various appetizers, and sandwiches here, and for the most part I've been pretty satisfied with the food.  My latest order was the veggie sandwich, which came with large slices of marinated portabella mushroom, cheese, tomatoes, basil, and lettuce.  Even though I ordered the junior size, it was still a hefty portion and I could only finish half of it!  The sweet potato fries were interesting in that they were dusted with cinnamon, adding a sweet dessert-like element to them.  Our server was great and provided refills as needed.  I would say out of all the locations, this one is probably the best one!",

    "text": "I thought I'd written a review for Oregano's.  We like Oregano's, normally, the Bellini is my favorite drink ever. Tonight our experience wasn't that good. I've emailed the corporate office, a copy of that email is below.   Tonight my husband and I went to the Oregano's located on Priest and Elliott in Tempe, AZ.   We go to that location a couple times a month.   Tonight we ordered our regular order of Belini, Pepsi, Boom dip, Bollo Pasta, and Italian Stuffed sandwich. On the way through the dining area the wings smelled really good. At first I didn't want to wait for them, then I decided, I'd order them and take them home.   We were out on the patio. As the waitress was packing up our left overs, she kept taking them inside.We heard a commotion just inside the door and I turned around to see a box on the floor with the familiar checked paper sticking out. Four of the wait staff gathered to discuss what to do. I told my husband \"they are going to give me the wings like nothing happened\".   And that is exactly what they did. They put the wing box on the bottom, my leftover Bollo on top in the bag and set it down. She took my husbands sandwich to box and when she came back. I asked: \"was that my wings that just dropped\" and the waitress replied \"oh but we're getting you a new order\".   I'm irritated by this point, the manager came out and said \"we've taken the charge off your bill, and we are getting you a FULL order of wings\". Well, it was 12 of 14 wings, I had left, so this wasn't much of huge difference for me. I returned the dropped wings. We decided to leave before receiving the wings.   I'm not upset that my wings dropped. I'm upset that they weren't upfront about it, and I'm upset that the manager was acting like she was doing me a favor. What I believe should have happened was; The server should have came to me, said \"hey the box dropped, but nothing fell out, we can give you these wings, and take them off your tab, or we can make you new wings but it will take 20 mins\". This leaves the options up to me while maintaining the honesty in the relationship.   Please do not make this about the server, this is obviously the influence of bad management as there was more than one server involved.  We won't be back for a while. We're not sure if we should even eat the left overs, who knows what happened out of our eye sight?",

Sat at a table with the high/bar chairs which are uncomfortable for me but seems to be the newest decor in most restaurants. Had the Boom Dip and The Sproccoli with Sausage. The Boom Dip was very good and impressed the other in our party. Asked for extra chips and made for a good appetizer. The wait time for the appetizer was approx. 30 minutes. Would have this again when visiting.   The pizza was very good and freshly made. I would like to think that the reason why it takes so long for your order is because everything is prepared after you order, but I am not sure. In any event, as the previous reviews indicate, you will have to wait before having a meal. Wait times for all of the meals was different. Perhaps a light snack or even a Snickers before going? Also not sure if they take reservations but the food is tasty and good portions. Floridino's, Spinato's, and Nello's are good competitors.",

My only complaint is that they switched the soda provider about 1.5 years ago and they went from these super fun giant cups to regular sized cups for drinks about 9-10 months ago.

I've been getting the same order here ever since I can remember: A small Cesar salad, Aunt Margarita Pizza with extra marinara, and of course the wonderful pizza cookie.  I LOVE the dressing on the salad I usually always ask for extra because I can't get enough of it, and I have found that the Margarita pizza is a little on the dry side so I have recently started ordering it with extra marinara and its as good as ever. But my absolute favorite part of the meal is the pizza cookie. They undercook it just right so its nice and doughy in the middle but crispy on the outside, topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate chips on top! Sometimes I just come in for the pizza cookie alone because its probably one of my favorite desserts!  The place is family owned and has expanded to several locations around the valley and I always get great service no matter what location I choose.",

I ordered the hot wings.  EEEEEE-gads!  Those things were spicy!  I had ordered wings from Oregano's before, but I must have ordered the Medium wings because I don't remember them having chunks of chili peppers all over them like these did.  They were pretty good in an uncomfortable sort of way.  :)  The service was adequate, but I would not call it friendly service.    The pizza got rave reviews by all the adults who tried it.   The garlic bread was pretty tasty.   The kiddo's meal of cheese pizza was not well-received.  She thought it was terrible and ignored it in favor of the garlic bread.  I didn't try it, but it looked like ultra thin crust with extra greasy cheese on it.  In other words, kids should love it.  Of course, my kiddo tried the Margherita pizza at Pizzeria Bianco (which I was prepared for her to hate) and she called it \"the best pizza ever.\"  Yes, I am raising a little foodie.  Oregano's is a really good alternative to other chains.  I eat there about once every year or so.  It is not really a destination restaurant, but the food is good and not having to wait to eat on a Sunday afternoon is priceless.",

    "text": "When we walked into Oregano's,  the first thing I noticed was the music. Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Harry James, big band jazz. All music I LOVE, but when we came in it was so loud that we couldn't have a conversation over it. We asked our waiter, Kevin, to have the volume lowered just a bit, and he complied cheerfully. Then I heard Count Basie's \"April in Paris\" and I suspected I was in the right place. With our pizza, the \"Bistro Classic\" we got a salad so big we split it. And the salad only costs six bucks. I ordered a Zinfandel (Seven Deadly Zins, which I had drunk before) from their limited wine list, and Kevin responded, \"Right. White Zinfandel.\" I said, \"No, not white Zinfandel, but regular Zinfandel. It's a red wine. Double check and make sure it's not white Zinfandel.\" He checked and, indeed it was an excellent Zin.  Except for that little hiccup, his service was faultless. He was attentive and the food was brought in a timely fashion. Then came the pizza. It might as well have come floating down from heaven on little angel wings. The crust was angelically thin and crisp. Instead of a tomato base, this pizza features an olive oil-garlic base topped with Wisconsin mozzarella. Over this lies a layer of fresh basil and sliced Roma tomatoes. Ingredients and seasoning were proportioned perfectly. It is one of the best pizzas we have ever tasted. As we were enjoying our meal, I happened to see the story about the owner's father, Lawrence Gibbilini, born in north Chicago in 1918. The manager very graciously printed a copy of the story for me to keep. Gibbilini's family started what may be the first pizza delivery service. Gradually Lawrence took over the cooking responsibilities from his wife. Until his death, he loved to invite friends over to eat pizza and listen to the big band jazz that he adored. When he died, his family found in storage hundreds of disparate pieces of chinaware and silverware that they never knew he was collecting. Apparently he had always dreamed of opening a restaurant that featured the food and the music he loved. Now his son has amply fulfilled his father's dream by offering us this wonderful package: Oregano's, the restaurant, the music, and some of the finest pizza in the world.",

AS for the salad.... On their website it states:  \"The Flagstaff Spinach Salad We start with fresh spinach, add lots of sauteed portobello mushrooms, red onions, roasted red peppers, diced tomatoes and mix with a tasty potion of lemon and avocado. It's all topped with a little Gorgonzola cheese. Backpack and tent sold separately.\"  I got no mushrooms and very little onions and peppers. Mushrooms are my favorite too! I do have to say that the lemon and avocado dressing was amazing...  I probably won't go back though, due to the fact that a salad is the easiest thing to make and they still couldn't get it down.",

Great vibe, very nice decoration (if you've never been inside, it's actually pretty cool) plenty of indoor and outdoor seating for your dining experiences. They have pretty much a full menu focusing on Italian based food. Well instead of getting my go to Pasta this time around I decided to get the stuffed pizza, MANNNNN THATS THE LAST TIME I DO THAT.   I ordered a stuffed pizza which I was told would take 25-30mins because of how it's made, sure no problem I'm not stressed right? WRONG, 45mins later it's not 945 and they are closing in 15mins and I still haven't gotten my pizza yet, when asked they said \"it should be coming right out, don't stress\".. don't stress? It's been an hour and you're about to close. Now shame on me for going into a establishment an hour before closing and ordering this, but I honestly at this point just wanted my food so I could get a to go box and leave. Just felt unwelcome to stay once it go there so I left.   I didn't tip because I did not feel that anyone deserved over the top performance.   But the pizza was good",

We arrived before 5 p.m. and it was fairly empty so we were seated immediately.   Our server, Jordan, appeared quickly and took our drink orders. From the start we knew it was going to be a good dining experience. Jordan has a great big smile and a happy tone in his voice.   Our drinks were brought out quickly and we ordered our salads. He brought drink refills too. I ordered the THE BIG BEEFSTRO SALAD and it was so, so good. I had not had it before and it really hit the spot. It was loaded with delicious shaved rib eye and really had a kick because it has tiny pieces of jalapenos mixed in. The dressing also has a kick and it was  also very good. It just might be my new favorite salad.   Service at this location is impeccable. Jordan was a delight and event spent a few quick minutes talking to us about his time living in Austin. This is the kind of dining experience I love...great food, outstanding service in a fun environment.   By the time we left at a bit before 6 p.m., it was getting crowded which is to be expected when the food is this good. Go and get yourself some food and ask to sit in Jordan's area!",

Those items were not in our order. There was an additional charge for each of the 2 additional items which I paid for. I called Oregano's and initially spoke with a woman who insisted I had not ordered from that location which I have proof that my order originated from their location. I then spoke with a Manager who coldly informed me she couldn't assist as I had no monetary exchange with Oregano's\". From a customer service perspective Oregano's absolutely could have done something but chose not to. For clarification purposes I asked who prepared and packed the order, response \"Oregano's. So I understand I have to deal with Door Dash for the monetary part of this but does Oregano's really think they can't do anything? Or am I being too harsh? Could the driver have taken the items? This was the Tempe location at Priest/Elliott. So now I'm trying to deal with Door Dash who wants to credit me for a future Door Dash order (which I will never use) so that is useless to me. Fortunately I paid with my credit card so will be disputing the charges. Hopefully someone will respond to me from Door Dash and I do plan to speak with the Store Manager of Oregano's. This was very disappointing experience. Shame on Oregano's for not even trying to provide any level of customer.",

It took no less than 30 mns to get our orders.  Actually we were about to walk out when it finally made it to our table.  Meanwhile another table of four left discouraged by the waiting time.  My Dark Alfredo and Ron' s pasta bowl and meat balls were then quick to follow.  We noticed a 25% off on our check for the inconvenience.

    "text": "As a past Chicagoan, I'm a sucker for Chicago stuffed pizza.  I'm talking the kind that is a layer of crust on the bottom and the top with a pound of melted Wisconsin cheese and savory toppings in the middle. I've been impressed by the number of pizzerias in the Phoenix area that serve it up.  Thus far, I've not been disappointed.  My family and I have vacationed in Phoenix for years during Spring Training.  Oregano's was the one pizza joint that we would always go-to for a taste of Chicago.  It's the kind of pizza that you crave.  In fact, when I would get their emails while living far from AZ I would pause and salivate.  It's surreal to live here now and know it's in my own backyard.    Today, the family took my Dad to Birthday lunch.  Mallory was a fantastic server and ensured by Dad's special day was special!  She was timely and on top of everything.  Our beers and wine were never empty.  The Guac a Tony was incredible served with pizza slices with a heaping scoop of creamy guacamole in the middle.  The boom dip was a first for us and one I would recommend to those that love artichokes and garlic.  But, the pizzas remained the star of the show.  Stuffed with Wisconsin cheese (the only real cheese in the US) along with cloves of garlic, black olives, and spinach, this pizza is unreal.  There was a great balance of crust and cheese topped with bright robust red sauce on top. Why the four stars? The kids chicken tenders were over cooked in the fryer.  But, Mallory removed the charge without question.  There are several locations in the Valley, but this one by far has offered the best service to-date.",

This was the first time I tried the Margaretta pizza and it was so good!! I loved how many tomatoes were sliced on top and that the crust was crispy and thin. It's one that I'll definitely be back to try again! I also enjoyed the bbq chicken; it's been great every time I've had it. Also, if it's your birthday you get a free pazookie! My favorite is the chocolate chip cookie, but my friends both love the white chocolate macadamia nut :)",

We've been to all the locations - and have been fans since the first restaurant opened in Scottsdale- but this one is now closest. The staff is great!   On this particular trip, we ran in to get a 2-go order - I love the separate entrance for us. However, I was devastated to learn our favorite salad - the All-Hail Caesar- is no longer on the menu! The staff really worked hard to help find a solution and made some great recommendations.    No one makes a better pizza! And the wings - amazing!   The food is really great, so we are still loyal fans - but dang, I'm going to miss that salad.",

    "text": "We had Daniel as a waiter tonight and I am highly upset with the service he provided us. We sat in the middle section and we ordered a chicken Lasagna.  Less then three minutes later he came out with the chef and brought us a chicken salad.   I ask him did this come with our order and he told us this is what we ordered. When I told him that we did not order this but we ordered the chicken Lasagna the chef apologies for his mistake and told us to keep it. They both walk away and my wife started to eat in the salad. Less then two minutes later Daniel came back and snatch the plates from our table while my wife was eating in the salad and had her fork in the salad. He pretended to act like he was going to the back and brought the same plates to the customer behind us. Then I told him why did he give them the same plates we had and he tried to lie and said that he did not when it takes at least 10 to 15 minutes to make their food. He did not know that I talk to the customer and look at the plates he gave them and it was the exact same food. So he had to give them the plates we had. Then he did not even try to compensate them for his mistake and try to cover it up. That is why I am highly upset. If this is the type of service I am going to receive I will take my business else where.",

When family comes to visit I always bring them here, it is close to home, has a large menu and you always leave stuffed plus enough for lunch the next day. MUST GET THE GARLIC BREAD. It is addicting and wonderful. The pizza cookie is also worth it, sign up with your email and get a free one on your birthday and first visit. Personal favorite is Mamas sausage and peppers pasta. Be aware of long wait on weekend nights and if you decide to order the deep dish that it will take 30-45 minites. Go and order BEFORE you're starving or you'll get super cranky. It is worth the wait though. Will be back :)",

This last trip though was not the case!! We arrived a little later around 9:15 so of course they were upset that we came into eat around closing time, but deal with it. Your restaurant says open until 10pm. I am sorry I got hungry at 9.   The host sat us with a younger girl and she just was so unsure of her own capabilities it made us uncomfortable. We ordered the calamari and a couple sides of sauce that I have been doing for years and she looked at me like I was crazy. I repeated what I wanted and she scampered off to figure it out. After that I ordered a Pablo Picasso salad which has also been my favorite for 5+ years. The salad came and I had a few bites and was really not impressed! It seems as if Mark expanded his chain and forgot to hire people to carry the quality of the founding restaurants to the new locations he has opened. The chicken was watery, the salad dressing was sparse, the tomatoes were not fresh and I was disappointed.   I don't live in AZ anymore, but was born and raised here, and when I come back to visit like this last time, I actually take my time to seek this restaurant out it used to be that good. Needless to say I will not seek it out again and am really sad that I have to mark it off my favorites list.   The gilbert and university locations have always proven flawless, and it could just be this location, but I was really bummed with the outcome.",

Fortunately, the closest to us is on Elliott Road, and have frequented it the most, though not the quaintest of the locations, it is fantastically terrific.  Oregano's has become our 'go-to' Italian in the Valley!  To date of all the menu items we've been able to enjoy have included: their 10\" Stuffed Deep Dish with Caramelized Onions, Meatballs, Spiced Feta; the fabulous Italian Wedding Soup; the Zany Ziti with Sausage which is soooooo good, and I know a great Ziti when I taste it; Oregano's supremely delish Boom Dip; Numero One-O 12\" Pizza; the decadent Chicken Parma Pasta; the incredible super Stuffed Riga Tony - superb; their incredibly fresh Big Dinner Salad with Ranch Dressing; Boom Dip; 10\" Whole Stuffed Pizza with Sausage, Mushrooms & Onions; the stupendous Flag Lasagna with Meatballs & Sausage; and the Clark Street 16\" Pizza; just to mention a few dishes.  Their beer and wine selections are terrific, from the Biggie Dos Equis; Canyon Chardonnay; Candoni Pinot Grigio Wine; ice cold Lagunitas Beer Pint Draft; Canyon Cabernet; Dos XX Pint; to the Sangria Blanco.  When in the mood for Italian, nothing fancy mind you, Oregano's is where we go, quaint and whimsical decor, great service, attention and reasonably priced, delicious food.  Ottimo cibo!",

Our server was Ramundo and he was excellent. This time my wife ordered the Bistro Calamari @ $6.99 and I did a repeat of the meatball hero @ $9.29. Additionally, we had two soft drinks at $2.49 each with refills.  Since the lunch hour had peaked, our meals arrived fast but we were in no big hurry. The meatball hero is big containing four meatballs. I only ate one complete side and the meatballs from the remaining side. It's enough for two, so maybe next time we'll split it and get a different appetizer. My wife reported that her calamari was very good. Both items arrived HOT temperature wise. The cost was $23.23 + tip. very reasonable for what we ordered.",

As we took a seat the waiter came a little after and she was very rushed she asked us what we wanted to drink and she spoke very fast and didn't even let us properly choose. Little after the waiter switch tables and the 2nd waiter was very pleasant. Not very pleased on what we order which was a Puerto Pensaco deep dish Nasty nasty Nasty nasty didn't even have carne on it also it was full of cilantro.",

I also liked the fact that they serve sodas in huge cups so you don't have to ask for so many refills. The ice cream cookie dessert was also really good. For the price, we were really impressed with the service and food quality. Will definitely add this to one of my faves. Only thing was that it seemed to take a long time for the food to come out.",

    "text": "This review is for the location on Elliot only.  My husband and I visited and ordered the root beer float (there is alcohol in this) and a Diet Pepsi (seriously, Pepsi?  Get it together and put some Coke on the menu).  Root Beer Float was good, tasted like a root beer float, but managed to look like a glass of dirty milk.  Pepsi tasted like the fountain used water from the toilet.    Dinner!  Yay!  Wait, noooooo.  Husband ordered the Chicken Parm and I ordered the stuffed rigatoni.  Both of these dishes came out with about a cup of fresh parsley sprinkled all over them.  Like the garnish, and literally a whole cup of it.  They also cut the stems up on it, but I'll get to that in a minute.  Lets start with the CHICKEN PARM.  First of all, it was a big breast of chicken, not a formed and processed patty of chicken asslips and beak.  The pasta with it was cooked only to the point of not crunchy.  And after the first bite my husband looked at me and said \"this tastes like they boiled the pasta in dirty water\".  I have to say, I don't think it was the pasta, I think it is their sauce.  My rigatoni tasted funny.  The ricotta inside was creamy and tasted good, but I couldn't put my finger on what tasted funny.  Then, just as I had figured it out, I felt something hard and crunchy in my mouth. A HARD AND CRUNCHYTHING IN MY RIGATONI?  Did I lose a tooth?  Was it a bug?  Oh, it was just a huge chunk of parsly stem.  There was so much of this crunchy parsley stem in the dish and the taste of the sauce was horrible, I couldn't eat it.  The manager came out (I hate when this happens, I'm not trying to get a free meal, I just don't like the food.  Get over it).  She offered to make us a pizza.  The Chicago Style I saw at the next table looked good, but I was told that takes 40-50 mintues to bake.  SIgh, we got a small cheese and pepperoni thin crust.    The pizza came out and it was just cheese.  The server that brought it informed us that the pepperoni was under the cheese.  I ate a piece and again, their sauce tastes like it was made with dirty tomatos from the garden, not good.  My husband choked down a few pieces of this and managed to find a piece of pepperoni under all that cheese.  Needless to say, I was upset as this location was not even close to the location in Tempe, or Camelback.  We won't go back and urge you to drive the extra 10 minutes eat at another one of their locations.",

We started with the garlic bread and marinara, very yummy but I really wish it came out cut.  I ordered the Bistro Classic pizza which was amazing, the tomatoes were plentiful and delicious. The rest of the family ordered the lasagna and the Italian sausage sandwich (Jr size), both were raved about.  Serving sizes are huge, we'll do more sharing next time without a doubt.  Also prices are very reasonable.  I was shocked to see our bill come out to under $50, I hadn't really paid attention to the prices when ordering and just expected it to be around $60.  Service left a bit to be desired but it was alright, and it's really loud in there, which I didn't love.",

Everything here is served family style while you listen to the vintage tunes linger in the air and garlic waft about your nose.   Pazookie.  That word alone is enough to get you there, right?  It's a cookie half-baked in a skillet and served with mounds of ice cream - all melty, ooey, gooey goodness brought right to your table.  Mmm. I tend to get a little...hmm...well...you've seen those Snickers commercials right?  That's me...I'm some lunatic when my blood sugar is low and then my friends have been known to say \"She's back\" once I've been fed.  Our poor waitress had to be so patient and kind with me while I ordered because I wasn't making a whole lot of sense and then she was perceptive enough to tell me one of the dishes I was considering would take substantially longer to cook than the other.  Bless her!   The drink glasses are also HUUUUGE!  This may have been the one time I regretted not ordering a soda - big always looks more delicious to me.   We thought the prices were a little steep when we were looking over the menu, but then all five of us ate until we were going to pop and we still got two more meals out of the leftovers.  Can I get an Amen?  Seriously.  Loved it.  Some of the pasta could have used more sauce, but that was really the only complaint.  The ranch dressing is Kick-A.    Our friend took us here during our Phoenix vacation and said it was a local favorite.  Yes, indeed!  If I ever hit up Phoenix again I am absolutely making sure Oregano's is on the agenda!",

But in this case I had to put this out.  We had lunch there and the food was okay, but not as it had been in the past.  The server was very good but it took a little while for the food to come to the table.  While it was lunch, I noticed that they were not as busy as they usually are.  I had the stuffed pizza and my friend had a few big slices.  The food was served hot and was acceptable, however, several hours later we were both not feeling well.  I'll spare you the gross details but lets just say, it was to much of a coincidence to not believe it was something we ate.  I think Oregano's is generally a great place and have had some good experiences there in the past, but currently there is something going on there ... I'll stay away for a little while until they get it all sorted out.  Please let me know if your experience is different, would love to give them another try in the future. Sorry Oregano's, you made one of very rare 'bad' posts list.  :-(",

The standard size salad would be perfect to share between 2 people and for $10, it's well worth it!  Not even 2 salads at Walmart/Safeway/Frys will cost you $10 and doesn't compare in quality.  Their waitress was excellent, she was professional, had great humor.  All around it was an awesome, experience.  I'm not giving it a 5 star only because I am super critical and 5 start would mean that they went the extra mile to come greet me at my door as I was pulling in and opened the car door for me.  lol",

They do everything they can to ensure your visit there is pleasant. Their food is also a good reason to go back because everything you try is a great option. The types of dishes I get their are usually the pasta or the wings and they are delicious every time. The best thing about Oregano's is their giant portion sizes. Every dish they have can definitely be shared with multiple people because that's literally how much food you are getting. I like to end my meal at Oregano's with a pazookie (cookie shaped like pizza with ice cream) because they are literally the best thing ever especially if you have a sweet tooth.",

I LOVE their Caesar salad, mostly because they use anchovies in their dressing making it a True Caesar.  Their menu is not my jam, too much peppers and SW spice so I tend to stick to the same things on their menu which is the Caesar salad and pizza.  Their pizza cookie is a fav as well and it is a nice touch that they offer a complimentary one on your birthday.  The frequent and consistent problem I have is the freshness of the romaine lettuce.  Each time I get a salad there, I get old lettuce that is either so old it dried out and is crispy, or is so old it is on the verge of turning into slime.  They have a giant bin of lettuce that you can see in their kitchen so they are either not doing a good job of cleaning it, or are using old lettuce with the new.  I now go through my salad and pick out the old pieces so I don't get a surprise while I am eating.",

It's still busy, but its bigger than many locations and doesn't feel claustrophobic. You will also be treated with a friendly staff and great food!",

Your employees don't get paid to tell me what I want to eat. And to top it all off your \"hot\" is medium at best. P.S the rest of the United States recognizes wings sold by the dozen. What's the deal with only 10 per serving. Thats over a $1 a wing. Pretty steep if you ask me. I will not be back.",

Among our party we had the stuffed mushrooms (delicious spicy Italian sausage, basil, cilantro, and marinara sauce), spinach artichoke dip, big beef sandwich, Italian wedding soup, and old fashioned sangria. We also had a birthday among us and they provided the BEST birthday dessert I've ever had - it was a HUGE warm chocolate chip cookie with several scoops of ice cream on top. AMAZING!  Alexa even included enough spoons for us all to try/share the dessert! SO impressive! The service was prompt, friendly, and professional. The environment was clean, the temperature comfortable, and the jazz music was a great compliment to the enjoyable ambiance of the restaurant. I'm sure that if I lived local, this would be a place we would frequently visit!",

It had that rubbery texture while biting and chewing it. I feel 3 stars is appropriate.  The bartender Kassandra was great. It was busy and I was a single person eating but she was very attentive and awesome. I would give Kassandra 5 stars.",

I went to bar to get a drink while waiting and we decided to camp there.  Really though, the hostess may tell you it's gonna be 25 minute wait but more often than not it's gonna be closer to 10-15 minutes.  I rather not wait if there's a seat at the bar. Sydney was on top of things, as always.  She provides great customer service, pours a good drink and knows the menu well.   I recommend the Anita Margartia, but she makes a refreshing Mojito that's pretty darn perfect too. I like the veggies sides, a LOT.  Don't know if anywhere else I can get Brussel Sprouts year 'round.  Yummy. Like and recommend the Bowl o' Pasta if you're really hungry.  I think it's bargain-priced up until 4 p.m.  you can get meatballs meat sauce or sausage with that bowl of pasta for an additional charge too.  Had a salad with steak in it to that I thought was great. Ziti is in a bowl made from pizza crust.  l wasn't too impressed with it because it's such a hard bowl, not really an edible unless it's meant to feed my dogs or chickens.  I suppose you could eat it but it's just kind of hard because they don't make it fresh. Pizza I've had only once and it just took so long I'll probably never want to order a pizza at Oreganos ever again. Good good, casual atmosphere, great servers too and a wait that's not typically as long as they quote.",

Our server, Kacy, took great care of us and her recommendations proved to be spot on. In fact, we were so happy with our meal and service, we took a group of friends there tonight, just so they could try it too. Our group had a Chicago pan pizza, a giant meatball sandwich, pasta and wings. Everyone enjoyed everything. (Oh and I also got a pizza to take home for tomorrow.)  We will happily drive every one of the 365 miles from Southern California to eat at this Oregano's again.",

    "text": "The place is not very large and should be larger.   We arrived before 6 and were told they get busy about 630.  We had a twenty five minute wait to sit inside.  The menu has all kind of options.   The sign warns you to order stuffed or Chicago style early while you are in line.  They take 45 minutes to cook a stuffed pizza!  It's worth it.  I was really wanting to try the big rig rigatoni with the chipotle sauce.  But we tried the zucchini sticks, and the long wait for stuffed crust would mean taking a pizza home.  The zucchini sticks are really good served with ranch, I think I would try to get marinara sauce too next time.  So they bring this chuck of pizza in a deep 10\" pan.  The sauce and cheese are nice and toasty.  With pepperoni, sausage, and extra cheese, they can't put it on the pizza stand for fear of collapse!   The sausage has a nice little bite.  The pepperoni is good but not as good as sausage.  The cheese spews out after you cut the pizza apart.   Great sauce with a nice sweet and spicy mix.  Plenty of real mozzarella cheese.  And the crust was prefect.    They have great Long Island Ice Tea!  At $9, it's not cheap but excellent",

That means no Gorgonzola vinaigrette... it also meant no Gorgonzola on the salad. Actually the fancy mixed green salad was ditched for its predecessor, the old style salad.  So the menu prices keep going up, but the food quality investment is going down. I understand how supply and demand works, but it shouldn't work that way for a \"mom and pop\" shop.  I am a salad lover, I want to start my meal the right way. Then last night I was offered balsamic dressing which actually translated to olive oil and balsamic reduction for my circa 1999 old style salad.   If you want to keep the regulars who helped you build your roots, please stop raising your prices and changing the menu. Committing to a 20 minute wait on a weekday starts to seem silly when your favorite menu items go missing (hahem ... peanut butter pizzuci).",

Oregano's has a great menu, good value, and friendly staff....and it's in my neighborhood!  Portions are large and the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting, as evidenced by the long queue each time I visit.  On my last visit (last night), the spouse and I shared a deep dish pizza and wondered why we didn't order that before.  Since a deep dish pizza takes about 40 minutes to bake, we lingered over our drinks and relaxed after a VERY busy work week.  We were fully primed to inhale our pizza when it arrived and wow, it was delicious.  Piping hot from the oven, we were hard-pressed not to gobble that pizza down, for fear of burning our mouths....lots of cheese but not too much that the crust and dough were swimming in it, tangy sauce, and yummy toppings (choose your own; we selected onions and mushrooms) all made for a wonderful taste experience.  Visit an Oregano's near you and support a home-grown business!",

I had the italian grinder and the boy that tagged along had the big rig-atoni. Can't decide which one I liked better, his or mine! I really like the spicy sauce on the rigatoni and my grinder was really good. We sat outside on the patio right by the fire which was really great and reminded me of why I love Arizona, after Thanksgiving and we have all these fantastic restaurants with patio's to enjoy! My grinder had cappicola ham which made me very happy! The waffle fries are good but not fantastic, a litle more batter than anything and way to crispy. For dessert we had to try the pizza cookie and it was warm, yummy, gooey goodness! We had the chocolate chip and it is huge, plenty for 2 with lots of ice cream. Service was great and we ended up getting their special buy $100 in gift cards and get $20 free since we will be back!",

    "text": "I have lived in the valley for almost 8 years now, and I have always avoided going to this place.  You see, I am Italian, and I am very picky about my Italian food, and how I like it.  Luckily my Oregano's-obsessed boyfriend made me go with him to the first time ever at this location.     Now, I'm not quite sure what I thought Oregano's was (::cough:: Olive Garden ::cough::) but it id diametrically different from my assumptions.  I have heard that they have taken a ton of stuff off of the menu and for that, they have lost a star.  But in all honesty, what I had was great.  Our waiter Shawn/Sean was attentive, nice (and pretty) and laughed when we decided we wanted a deep dish pizza with 10 toppings on it.  He began to realize we were serious with all of the toppings when we didn't laugh and looked him square in the eye... He took out his pencil and paper and asked us to resume.  (That part was funnier than I've made it out to be.)  They had an okay selection of beer, but luckily a good one. He was on point with our order and let us know well in advance how long it would take to cook our monstrosity.  I appreciated the heads up as  our pizza took all of 30 minutes but for fresh, custom, deep dish pizza, it was well worth the wait.  As a woman that revels in her pizza making skills and her cooking abilities, Oregano's made a damn good pizza that day, and for that I commend them.  Just make sure to not remove anything else off the menu and we'll be good.   P.S. Th Bruschetta was ridiculous. It was so tasty, I'll probably go back to copy the recipe... YUM!",

We came in late last night, around 10 pm. We we're greeted right away, he was super friendly, he kept up on the refills, boxed our food up, offered us to go cups for our drinks, and he even assisted me in getting the wristband off me from an event we just went to! Great service! Here's the issue though...we didn't catch his name and my bf couldn't find the receipt. So if a manager is reading this he has close cropped dark hair and black glasses, young handsome guy, and he was working the little covey to the far right on 10/25. We actually tried to find a manager after we left but we were one of the last tables and I think everyone was in the back. He deserves a raise!",

When I first heard about them I knew everyone raved about how good they were. I check out the menu and was unsure of the southwestern meets Italian cuisine but the more I try it the more I like it. The flavors are great and work really well together. The Big Rig Pasta is my favorite but I also like their pizza. For lunch you can get a huge slice for like $3. Their stuffed pizza is really good but since it is baked it takes awhile. About 45 minutes to an hour but you know it is fresh and it is so worth the wait. Only thing is it isn't too good cold. I love cold left over pizza but this just turns into a big congealed mess. So bring enough people to finish it off or heat it up if you take left overs home. I took my girlfriend here the other day for lunch. She had never been before. I was nervous because she is a really good Italian cook and therefore has high standards when it comes to Italian food. She was questioning the southwestern/Italian mix like I did. I was hoping she would like it and she did. Whew. She got the Italian grinder which she was glad was called a grinder and had real cappicola ham on it. She also had a few bites of my Big Rig Pasta and liked that as well. Good we can come back and try other things. We told the waiter that it was her first time there and had never had one of their pizza cookies so he gave us one for free. That was really cool. It was also really good. Nice and soft and warm with really good vanilla ice cream on top. I didn't know they had 3 different kinds but we got the regular chocolate chip. I will definitely be bringing her back here and tagging along with her.",

Even though we've never lived close to any of the locations, we've had so many great moments (and honestly, in 13 years, only ONE bad experience) at this local chain. We had our first date on University in Tempe and we had our wedding celebration party (after eloping to Australia) at the Scottsdale location. The front patio at the Mesa restaurant was the choice for my husband's 40th birthday party.   Always great service! Great atmosphere (friendly, fun) and great food. Our two boys now love to come with us to the newest location (near our home in Ahwatukee--thank heaven!) on Elliot Rd in Tempe which will surely be our new local hot spot, as it is near my husband's work as well. WE ARE SO EXCITED!  My favorite items on the menu (although I admit, I'm finally steering away from my usuals so that I can try the rest of their extensive menu):  Kick BUTT Garlic Bread (be sure to order it with cheese and a side of marinara)--YUM! Guaca Tony (I only recently tried this and am sorry that I've been missing out all these years)  Chicken Ceasar Salad (dressing is SO good, and there's never too much of it)   The Sproccoli Deep Dish or Stuffed Pizza - have a little salad, which comes out quick; then wait another 20 minutes or so for the Chicago-style pie--SO worth the wait! (and so filling, you'll have leftovers for lunch the next day!)",

    "text": "For three years I have been eating at different Oreganos restaurants around the valley. Bi go approximately 3 days a week to be exact.  Well today is the first time I have ever had to cancel an order.  It took them over 30minutes to make an antipasto salad.  Which I asked to be made without the cheese tons. Been they brought it out it in fact had them.  They said they would remove them and 15 minutes went buy and still no salad.  Being I had to return to work j asked to cancel the salad.  As we were getting ready to leave one hour after arriving they showed up with the salad that had been canceled and yes it still had the cheese tons on it.  I said no thank you to the gentleman and he in turn was very rude and stated loudly that all he wanted to do was take care of us and threw The salad across the bar to the trash.  I would have returned if he was not such an ass. Bee will not return to this establishment and I will tell our friends not to return as well!!!!",

The BBQ wings are so good. They are crispy, hot, and bathed in sauce. Service at Oregano's has never failed me. In Tucson, AZ and in Phoenix, AZ service is great :)",

    "text": "I love pizza, especially Chicago Stuffed Pizza that you can find in the middle of Arizona. If you haven't been to Chicago, or if you have and have been to Girodano's Pizza while visiting there, then you may know that their stuffed pizza is among the best there is. Who knew that a restaurant in Arizona served the same style pizza that actually comes so close to the real thing! Now you must know that the stuffed crust pizza is a work of art, that it HUGE, and thus will take about 30-45 minutes to make perfect. But if you have to be anywhere to wait that long for a pizza, Oregano's is the place to be. Every single one of the waiters and managers will say hi to you as you pass them, even if they aren't the one's helping you. There's great music playing throughout the restaurant, and the outside back patio has a great mural on the wall. You must must MUST check out Oregano's if you are visiting AZ. DO IT!",

    "text": "Good food, terrible service.  My wife and I took our two grandsons, age 5 and 1 for pizza and pasta. Restaurant made an accommodation and seated us quickly.  After that, the experience went downhill.  We ordered a pizza and kid's meal.  Our server came by 3 times to tell us the food would be out soon.  After telling the same story 3 times, you think he would come up with a new story, as the old one became more unbelievable as time went on.   Pizza finally came, but no kid's pasta meal.  Had to request that 2 more times as well as the kid's milk refill.  Finally had enough and asked for the manager.  He finally showed up (a recurring theme here, slow as turtles).  I told him the pizza was good but the service was poor.  He didn't appear to much care what I thought but did take the kid's meal ($2.99) and the .69 milk refill off the bill.  Didn't much offer anything else.  Table next to us had some issues as well.  We have eaten at other Oregano's in the past and always found both food and service to be good.  This is a newer location but has been here longer enough that they should have the customer service piece down.  Apparently not.    I'll drive by this location, there are too many other choices locally that know how to treat the customer. Would not recommend.",

I work nights so usually take my one hour lunch break about 9 P.M. and I decided to try the Oregano's near my work for the first time. Since it was my first time going to Oregano's I had high hopes because of all the wonderful reviews from my friends that were accompanying me. We arrived around 9:15 and were seated quickly and immediately received our drinks. After we ordered the \"Boom\" dip which turned out decent enough, we ordered the Pablo Picasso salad, The Lady is a scamp, and the Pesto Penne Bowl at around 9:30. After about 20 minutes of waiting and only one drink refill we started noticing the waitress doing her closing duties. About 40 minutes after putting in our order we still hadn't received our food and were constantly checking the time wondering if we would have enough time to eat or if we would just need to get it to go. At about 10:10 we still hadn't received our food or assurance it was coming out soon. We quickly decided to pay for appetizer and head back to work. After walking around searching for our inattentive waitress I quickly paid the bill and left.",

    "text": "Several years ago my Father and Stepmom used to take my sisters, brother and I out to Oregano's Pizza Bistro, the location off of Mill Ave. and University.  We would often walk to that location because it was just a few short miles through our old neighborhood.  Sadly after moving from Tempe to Mesa, our outings to the good ol' pizza joint happened less and less often.  It was soon just a comforting memory of sharing time, music and good food with my loved ones.  Recently Oregano's had been reintroduced into my life. I was meeting with my older sister for a bite, wanting to meet somewhere in the middle that night, my sister mentioned that an Oregano's had recently been built near her house, the Priest and Elliot location.  All of the old memories of going out with my family sharing the good food, music and company came dancing back in my head, I couldn't have imagined a better place to go!  I pulled up, the parking lot packed, which was no surprise (I vividly remember always waiting impatiently as a child to get a seat at the old location.)  My sister and niece had arrived first and had been seated on the patio.  Walking into Oregano's is like walking into a family member's house, warm cheery welcomes from everyone!  The hostesses were helpful and pointed me in the right direction to the patio.  The ambiance of the place had instantaneously put me in a great mood, lively music, outgoing personalities found in every employee, it felt like home!  Our waiter came up moments after I had gotten seated, suggesting and appetizer and offering me a beverage.  He was friendly and laid back, not talking to me as a customer he was serving, but rather a guest, a friend, in his own home.  I took his recommendations on the \"Dirty Monkey\" and \"Kick-butt Garlic Bread.\"  Both arriving promptly and were delicious.  The \"Dirty Monkey\" is an adult beverage which consists of sweet liquors and juices, it was definitely a tasty treat!  The \"Kick-butt Garlic Bread\" was huge!  Definitely a fair bargain for what you get!  My sister and I split the \"Big Rig Pasta\" which was the same thing we had always gotten in the past.  It was comforting to see it was still on the menu after all those years.  Once it had arrived we indulged in the creamy chipotle covered rigatoni noodles.  Topped with fresh basil and tomatoes, it was better than I remembered!  After over indulging I mentioned to my sister how it made me so happy to be there, and admiring everything about the restaurant.  Working in the food industry myself I confessed this wasn't like a normal restaurant, though I love where I work, this was different.  I felt as if I was among all friends and family, I felt at home.  A server must have over heard my statement and had dropped off an application at my table.  He was smiling and friendly and simply said \"You should work here if you're unhappy there.\"  This man wasn't the same waiter that had been helping us out that night, he had just been serving the other half of the patio.  I was caught off guard, and sort of laughed it off and the man walked away.  I couldn't help but play with the idea, though I knew it was almost impossible, I already had a job tending bar and serving at another restaurant, between that and school my availability was next to nothing.  Although the thought of working at a place like this was an entrancing one.  Overall the experience was just what I needed!  I am very pleased that Oregano's had come back into mine and my families lives.  Even more so pleased that they have stayed True to their roots, Lawrence Gibbilini's philosophy of life, which he was known to live by everday, \"The key to happiness is friends, good food and music.\"",

We always come with plenty of time on our hands because we know things take time, I'm cool with it and so is my family. But, the last time we were here it was my birthday and our waitress made it so special. I wish I could remember her name, but she was so cool with a pixi blonde hair 'do. She helped my vegetarian mom modify a dish that my mom really ended up liking. I got the Margherita Pizza well done and my god it was so, so, so good. I can't remember what my dad got, but he really liked it. And my guy got Lasagna and he loved it. Of course, I got the free birthday cookie thing and shared it with everyone, and THEN our SUPER COOL waitress brought us a mini Bellini for us all to share! My mom had never had one and she loved it! (It was STRONG too!). Anyway, I really love Oregano's, they go above and beyond and I've never had a bad experience there.",
