As a vegetarian I was pleased to see a bunch of options. Soon enough though I learned almost all of their vegetarian options contain meat included. You can just ask for no meat but its a hassle imo.  The food was ok.  It had a unique taste but  was pretty plain. I ordered the homestyle tofu minus the meat and all it came with was tofu and 3-4 mushrooms. Nothing else. Normally this dish comes with a bunch of different veggies at other places.  The portion size was the smallest I have ever seen. I left hungry.  I will not be back. There are just too many other places to eat around here that are better value.",

My wife is asian and I eat a lot of Asian food.  Chinese food has always been at the bottom of my list for my asian food preferences.  Thai, Korean, Vietnamese and Japanese food are preferred before Chinese food.  However, this restaurant has literally moved the entire genre chinese food up my list!  Wow!!!    - Fish Fillet with Hot Chilli Peppers  (SPICY & delicious).    I only had one dish, but I may never have another when I eat here.  This dish is soooooo good, if you like spicy.  There is something in it that I haven't tasted since I ate spiced Jako while I was in Japan.  There isn't an english word for this ingredient, but it is a small herb about the size of a peppercorn, that causes a tingle in your mouth.  (My mouth is watering while I type).    This little herb mixed with the hot chili peppers and light tender white fish.  What a delight!.....almost sensual!  If there were 6 six stars on Yelp's rating system, I would give them to this dish.  An epicurean delight.      Oh and the prices really good too!",

Seafood items, I tried sauteed shrimp and salt & pepper calamari, are good with just the right amount of spicy and crunch.   Service is where this restaurant needs much improvement.  The first time I came at 11:30 am and were able to get out in 45 minutes.  The second time I came at 12:30 and spent 2 hours for lunch with most of the time waiting for the waiter to take order and do miscellaneous service like getting bows, spoon or cheque (I ended up getting the to-go box myself).",

Came here today with some friends and I was thinking perhaps I should have warned them. We got seated right away and were handed menus. These were the regular menus and they had stuff like pig intestines, frog, kidneys, lungs. Also on the wall were specials written out in chinese characters. There were probably 40 people in there for late lunch/early dinner and we were the only table speaking to our servers in English. I was expecting one of my friends to say something along the lines of: \"Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Panda Express/Pei Wei/PF Chang's anymore.\" But no - everybody was totally into it. We got the Crispy Sesame Duck - fried and salted with juicy crispy skin. That one was a winner. We also got Mapo Tofu - always a winner with me since I love the soft tofu in black bean sauce and Szechwan spices and oil. We also got the Shredded Pork In Hot Garlic Onion - which was also delicious. Service was great. We had an unruly kid in our midst but the servers were VERY patient with him. Once the food came he calmed down and dug into it. Needless to say we all left full and happy. My goto place for Szechwan has been both Szechwan Garden and Szechwan Palace ever since Miu's closed. This one is the closest to where I live so I know I will be back again. It's in a strip mall in a corner by itself so there's always lots of parking. Check it out.",

I would love to give this place 4 or 5 stars, but they need to improve on many things before that happens.  Here is what happened. We ordered two beef noodle dishes, but when the order came out, there was only 1. Isn't it a bit obvious that there are X amount of people and there is 1 less entree ordered? It took 3 different waiters/waitresses to get it fixed and by the time I got my bowl, my friends were already done eating.  Shaolin bao's are tasty, but they are a bit overpriced at 8 bao's for $8. We asked the server how many bao's per order, but he didnt know so another server came and said \"8, but am not sure.\" Shouldn't the server know these things?   They shouldn't be so stingy with the ice, our cups literally had like 3 cubes per cup, and when they refilled our water, there was no ice in it at all. When we sat down, when they poured our water, the waiter guy overfilled our cups resulting in water spilled on the floor and splashing onto my feet. It's just water, but still annoying.   In all, the food is pretty good, worth 4 stars. Their service was a 2. Give them a few weeks to work out the kinks and improve their service and I will visit this place again.",

Telling a customer no you can't do it will ensure one thing: the customer goes somewhere they will. Try visiting other restaurants and see how they do it.  So I got my lunch they way they wanted me to have it. Result? Loss of additional revenue and an unhappy customer. I guess not all business owners actually have business sense.

Most of their menu (that I've tried) is characterized by lots of peppers, oil, a good amount of vegetables, and well-balanced, unique flavor combinations. I'd highly recommend Hot and Spicy anything (especially Hot and Spicy Fish), Salt and Pepper Calamari, Lamb with Cumin, and the Eggplant dish (can't remember the exact name, but I think there's only one).

    "text": "Permit me to use this space to digress before proceeding to the review. In my short time here in PHX, I have observed two kinds of reviews of Chinese restaurants, often written for the same restaurant, but seemingly as if people had eaten at two completely different restaurants.  There is the sweet-and-sour pork/fried rice/egg roll crowd-type of review, where the patrons expect old school Cantonese American food. I am sad to report that style of cooking, if not already dead in most places, is but a shadow of its former self. Younger people think it is inauthentic or fake; I grew up around the people who cooked it in chop suey restaurants and served it mostly to non-Chinese, and thought it was delicious. It is now cooked by generally non-Cantonese folks, since the bosses and cooks have all largely retired if not passed on at this point, their children mostly having become professionals. The secrets of their cooking were taken with that generation to the grave, and subsequently, these writers are uniformly disappointed, as reflected in their reviews.  The other kind of review generally is written by the natives and the cognoscenti, who go to that same restaurant to eat from the so-called \"secret\" or \"Chinese menu\", and they have an entirely different, generally positive experience. Their experience reflects the reality that Chinese cuisine in the US became quite diverse after 1965. That year, American legal barriers that prevented Chinese from immigrating since 1882 were finally torn down, and as economic and migration changes occurred, many different regional Chinese cuisines started to appear here.   This is one of those reviews. Szechuan Garden, AKA , is one of those regional Chinese stars in the East Valley, and we're very lucky to have them here, along with several other great Sichuanese restaurants in Chandler. I hear you ask, if we should not expect Cantonese American food at a Sichuanese restaurant, then what should we eat?  Reader, let me finally put before you our typical Sichuan Thursdays menu: there is an amazing , kung pao chicken, at least as good as the storied memories of my childhood favorite, the Moon Palace/ restaurant in Chicago, properly cooked here as a lightly sauced chicken and peanuts dish. , the lamb skewers, spiced with cumin, salt, and chili, are very good, but, an even better version of that is the , cumin lamb, which is a big plate of dry, stir-fried lamb with the same seasonings. , mapo tofu, is excellent here: the tofu is soft, sauced with Sichuan peppercorns and chili, producing the unusual signature \"ma la\" numbing heat feeling of Sichuanese food. , boiled dumplings, are good, but benefit from a dunk in , zhenjiang black rice vinegar, and some ginger slivers wouldn't hurt either. We also have had the , water-boiled fish, which is good, but, I think it is actually better elsewhere. All of this goes over rice. And you'll want a vegetable, which for us is usually , dry-fried string beans, or the garlic spinach, both excellent. Service has been always very responsive and friendly despite my horrible, freshman-year level Putonghua spoken with a heavy Cantonese accent.   And now you know.",

That changed drastically as by the time I left, it was about 3/4 full and everybody but me was speaking Mandarin. You know a place is good when the nationals are in there eating. The place is very clean (although I didn't visit the restroom) and right off the bat, the service was very good, and remained that way throughout my stay. My meal was very simple. I was battling a cold at the time so I figured a good, spicy soup type dish was in order. I ordered the seafood soup with dan dan noodles and asked them to make it spicy. The bowl was enormous and I thought, \"I'll never eat all this,\" but boy was it good! I polished that bowl off and even surprised myself. The bowl was $10 and I had water, so most definitely well worth it. 2 thumbs up and I can't wait to go back.",

I like their hotpot which has a lot of Hua Jiao (Sichuan pepper) in it and when I accidently bit it, my mouth gets numb and it was not a great feeling at all. The dan dan mian was tasty and very juicy too, will try this one again if I come back. My friend had the order of the dumplings swimming in hot oil which to me, not a fan, but to my friend, he ordered it every time he came in so I basically had chance to try his \"real Sichuan dish\". I also order the Vegetable Egg Foo Young and it was unexpectedly so good, but we were too full to finish it so i asked for a togo box to have it for my lunch the next day.  Service is great, very attentive!!",

If you're looking for authentic and flavorful Chinese food, you found your place.  Being Chinese, I can honestly say, I know the difference between good Chinese food and Americanized Chinese food. Moreover, both of my parents loved this place. After my mom passed, my father came here nearly every other day to get food. If that's not a vote of authenticity, I'm not sure what else is.   Onto the food! It's flavorful, filling and if you're willing to try new things, you may find your new favorite dish. I personally can't start a real Chinese restaurant experience without a bowl of hot and sour soup. Their  has the right amount of heat and tartness. I always add in a dash of white pepper to kick it up a bit.  The eggplant is a hit if you're eating with Chinese food newbies. I believe they have two kinds. Ask for the one with wood ear... trust me.   Service! If you don't speak Chinese, please, for all that is good and holy, BE POLITE AND PATIENT. Don't get your panties in a bunch of the Chinese (and very sweet) servers take awhile to understand that you really can't have anything with gluten. You think they were taught \"gluten\" in their night classes? Hell, do YOU even know what gluten is? But I digress...   This place is awesome and again, authentic. So please take it for what it is. Enjoy the Chinese TV and trust me, loud slurping is a total compliment.",

    "text": "Your taste buds will tingle at Szechuan Garden, both from the great flavors, and from the spiciness of the food!  We attempted to eat here on a Friday night, but it was packed to the gills, with several people waiting outside for a table to open up.  We decided to eat somewhere else, and come back again for lunch.  The lunch specials are a very good deal.  They come with a very good portion of main dish, with rice and soup.  Prices will range from $5-7 depending on what \"tier\" you order from.  I had #19, the \"Fish fillet with hot chili peppers).  Although I've had spicier and bolder tasting versions of this dish, this version wasn't so spicy that it left a weird aftertaste as I ate more, which I appreciated.  Also, the lowered heat level allowed more of the flavor of the spicy peppercorns and chilies to show through, and occasionally I'd get a hit of some fragrant whole peppercorn as I chewed.  The spicy bold broth was a good contrast to the delicate texture and mild flavor of the fish.  In addition to fish, there were bean sprouts and napa cabbage in the dish, with a sprig of cilantro on top.  The only slight negative, which is probably more of a syndrome regarding the dish itself rather than the kitchen's preparation, is that it is a very unctuous broth, layered with a copious amount of chili oil.  I also tried some \"Shredded pork with hot garlic onion\".  It was also a good portion, with tender pork and a salty, slightly pungent flavor.  Service was good, and drinks were refilled as needed.  It helps if you speak Mandarin here, and they do have specials on the wall, but they are written in Chinese.  This is definitely a new favorite for spicy authentic Chinese food!",

Family style dining with a big lazy susan in the middle to make sharing easy. Loved the orange chicken - lightly breaded with no chewy fat pieces like I'm so used to getting at other places. My brother got the sweet and sour ribs and they were also delicious.   Would highly recommend - its even cheap, under $10 a plate (big enough for 2-3 people to eat from with complimentary rice)",

Four of us enjoyed an appetizer plate.  You select from about 10 items at a little bar.  We chose pickled Lotus root, Marinated Cucumber, and Tofu thread.  I loved them - I really really loved them!  The lotus root was fascinating - it tested my chop-stick skills - but I was able to put away my fair share, thank you very much!  We had a pot of hot/sour soup.  It was very good - not too spicy (I would love a bit more) but it was loaded and very fresh.    Main courses - Walnut shrimp - was amazing.  Not over cooked - the shrimp were perfect.  Chong Qing Spicy Chicken (or Chong Qing La Zi Ji) It was a little different than I expected (no sauce) - but easy to eat - very tasty.  Lots of chilies but it's not overwhelming!  It left me with a little \"tingle\" in my mouth!  Next was a pork dish was called Hong Shao Rou or Mao Braized Pork.  Little chunks of fatty pork in an amazing sauce.  Loved in on my rice and scoop up a bit of sauce, rice and a bite of pork.  Fantastic.  If you're not a fan of the fat - you can easily pull the thicker parts off and enjoy ... either way - it's awesome!  (After everyone finished the pot - I grabbed a spoon and pulled out as much of the sauce as I could and ladled it over the rice... O M G...) We also enjoyed a potato dish - Potato and Garlic Oil.  The potato was in threads similar to spaghetti - not raw but not over cooked - you could easily pick it up with your chopsticks.  I loved the flavor and crunch!    The very best thing was the fried green beans.  O M G ... I couldn't get enough of them - cooked perfectly - enough to not be raw - but still leave a bite.  The thin layer of flavored coating was incredible.  We ordered two plates of beans... and two of the shrimp... and two of the chicken.    Don't judge!  It was awesome - and I skipped lunch that day so I deserved it.  Don't miss this place!  Some of the menu items can be a bit off-putting for us that don't have the experience or fortitude to try them - I'm sure they are just as great as the things we did try - but rest assured - you'll find LOTS of items on the menu you'll love!  I'll be back!",

    "text": "I'll start with the worst part... We saw they had xiao long bao  which is a soup filled dumpling, and were so excited to order and eat them. When made correctly, it's delicious and juicy and amazing. The server said that they take longer to make and we were ok with that. About half an hour later they came out and they looked so sad and flat. All of the soup had spilled out before they even cooked it and it tasted like day old dumplings that were just reheated (look at the picture I posted of the sad and unappetizing xiao long bao). We also ordered the twice cooked pork which was pretty good, we would definitely order it again. We also ordered mapo tofu which was not good. It didn't taste like the mapo tofu you would normally find at a Chinese restaurant. We ordered the chongquin chicken which was like battered popcorn chicken sauteed in peppers and it definitely didn't taste like the delicious chongquin chicken we've had at Szechuan palace on 44th and McDowell. The server was really nice, she was an older lady and helped us order the popular tasty dishes she recommended. We did have to wait for a really long time to get someone's attention to get our check and pay.",

Thank goodness for the menu covered in photos as we could not read all the hand written little banners with their dishes hanging on all the walls.  There were 4 tables for 2, 6 tables for 4, and 3 very large round tables.  I noticed my wife and I plus one older gentleman were the only non orientals in the restaurant, and for Sunday noon most of the tables were filled.  All the staff was smiling, friendly and helpful, with the majority speaking very little English, as I initially said \"transported\"! We actually had 2 non spicy dishes out of 3: Steamed Juicy Pork Dumplings.  8 splendid round pockets of dough filled with meat and soup, 6.98;  Honey Walnut Shrimp, with 11 or 12 succulent jumbo shrimp and lots of half walnuts, 11.98; Salt and Pepper Calamari, a huge portion of fried Calamari with dried hot red peppers and slices of very hot green peppers mixed in.  Crunchy salted pieces of tender squid perfectly cooked with delicious heat!  This was a lot of memorable excellent food and we just had no room for anything else :)  Service +++++, environment +++++, staff +++++, value +++++, and taste +++++!

We ordered the sauteed green beans, the spicy pork lunch special, the chow fun, Xiao long bao, and scallion pancakes. I wanted to come here specifically for XLB, and they did not disappoint. They were a little on the big side, but not too big to eat all in one bite. My only issue with them were that they didn't bring any sauce for them and then kinda disappeared so we couldn't get any..... I think this may have been more of a product of their busy -ness than what is typical. Anyway, the xlb were juicy and delicious. I would come back for that alone. The rest of the food was also tasty, with the green beans being the best item - they were spicy and garlicky and delicious. The chow fun was good, but forgettable, the pork was also tasty. We ate a ton of food and still only paid abut 10$ per person. I will definitely be back!",

Again Superior. I think the beans were Chinese long beans  as they were crisp and without any large beans as so often is the case.  Overall the service was superior, attentive but not intrusive. The meal came quickly. And the bill came without having to chase down a waiter.

Sichuan cuisine is known for its numbing pepper corns and spicy chili oil, both of which were prominent in the spicy chicken dish.   Authentic Chinese restaurants aren't really known for their ambiance and service, so if you're looking for a nice night out, you might want to go somewhere else.

It's a little on the $$ end, but hey, it's soft shell crab. I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had, but for what we can get around here, I was satisfied.   I'll just mention the things we got during the dine in since it was more recent and I remember it better... ;)  The cold appetizers - tofu, white - not spicy, greenish (not sure if that was tofu, but hey, I don't really mind. If it tastes good I'll try it!)  - little spicy, pig ear - spicy. All were delish!  There's a hot oil & spicy fish dish. They're known for it. That was super good! We did ask for it not to be as spicy and they accommodated us, which was nice. It was just enough kick for us. TRY THAT! She also recommended the equivalent dish, but with lamb. Next time I'd like to taste test that one.   The fried pork ribs were just normal. Nothing special or out of the ordinary. We also got a veggie dish. We always ask what kind of veggies they have. Sometimes they have ones that aren't on the menu.   All this filled the 6 of us and was pretty reasonable in price.   I liked the service. I mean really, I never go to a Chinese restaurant expecting good service. I just look forward to the food. But the lady gave us her recommendations. We were hesitant on the fish dish (bc we weren't sure if it'd be too spicy), and she told us to get the lunch portion vs the dinner since it was smaller and if we didn't like it, we wouldn't have as much. That was cool.   If you like spicy, I'm sure this place would fill your tank. If you aren't total spicy fans, there's still enough stuff and ways for them to accommodate to your liking, like they did for us.",

    "text": "My daughter tells me, next time I'm in her area for lunch I should call her and she'll meet us. My wife is Chinese and we spent time in Sichuan and both love Sichuan and Hunan cooking.  So we meet at Szechuan Garden. My wife is certain to get her favorite Hunan frog legs which of course my daughter won't touch. But my wife drags my daughter over to the cold 'deli' counter and when they return, my daughter has a sickened look on her face and basically is telling me that she can't believe the things they eat. Anyway, the deal is like 3 selections from the cold deli for $6. The cold chicken is very tasty, the tofu strips were a concession for my daughter and the pigs ear skin in Sichuan pepper oil were one of the things that my daughter was struggling with - but rather tasty. Those with less of a sense of adventure should definitely get the beef tendon in the pepper oil since it is one of the things that truly reminds me of being in Chengdu.  My daughter gets a rather bland, Cantonese lunch and of course is unimpressed. Wife suggests that this probably isn't the place to bring my daughter who pretty much has issues with eating anything that reminds her that it once walked/flew/swam on earth.  But of course that leads me to the second phase of this review... the next time I go there.  I'm to meet my wife there and I am running late. She orders without me. Frog legs and pigs ears were not on today's table... Now I pride myself on being able to eat pretty much anything and I certainly recognize that the only thing Chinese won't eat is the oink itself but today is a struggle.  Wife has already ordered and already gracing the table is another Hunan inspiration but instead of frog legs, it's pork intestines. I pause a moment and say, what the heck and I'm almost embarrassed to admit that it was outstanding. Next up was the cold deli mix which contained my favorite oil/pepper mix but instead of beef tendon (my #1 choice) or pigs ear (eh), my wife suggests that this is cow lung. That Sichuan peppery oil has a chocolate quality to it... enough of it could probably make shit taste good. I'm really struggling though with the psychology of eating pigs intestines and cow lungs. Thankfully, we had the lamb ribs dry rubbed with cumin which although was rather sparse in the available meat category, the flavor was rather exceptional.  So this is the bottom line here. If you want to eat Szechuan (and the real Chinese pinyin spelling is Sichuan), you have to:  - do as good as you can to suspend your beliefs on what is edible and be willing to try something out of ordinary to find the real live food tastes available here.  - don't order Cantonese items... go to a Cantonese restaurant for Cantonese food. Cantonese is sweet, plain, bland. Egg Foo Young, Fried Rice, Orange Chicken, Sweet and Sour anything... go somewhere else. This is the Szechuan Garden.  - definitely do a plate from the cold deli counter and make sure you get something with the Sichuan peppery oil whether it's beef tendon or even just the cold chicken with the oil... it's a True slice of Sichuan  - Water boiled (fish / beef / chicken) etc. is incredible and most highly recommended.  - Hunan cuisine is quire rare in the valley and while I won't say that Szechuan Garden is great Hunan cuisine, it's certainly quite good, definitely different.  I'm hoping that there's laws on the books that prevent restaurants from selling dog because my wife would definitely order it. As it is, she is under instructions never to let me eat dog when I am with her in China and as insurance, a secondary promise to not tell me that I am eating dog.   As for the pork intestine... I admit it was extremely good and while I would have a difficult time ordering it myself, if it's put in front of me, I'm sure I would eat it again.  Restaurant... don't know about Szechuan Palace now that they changed ownership but this is one of the real gems in the valley",

    "text": "I tried asking some other Yelpers one morning if they liked this place more than Tao Garden.  I've always liked Tao Garden the most in Chandler area, but the Long John Silvers decore of old was a little too much to handle after a while.  I came to Szechwan Garden with a friend, and I saw the noticeable change in the decor.  It was previously iKitchen (korean/ramen).  iKitchen didn't do much to change the look from the TOGO that was there before them.  Szechwan Garden added touches of red with lanterns.  They changed the tables into the classic round table with red cloth we see at most asian restaurants.  Though there were plenty of free tables, we somehow got stuck with the two seater next to the bathroom.  I wish we could've sat elsewhere, but I assumed they were expecting a massive lunch crowd and didn't want to have wasted seating.. I could deal with that.  Prices were in three tiers: 4.98, 5.98, and 6.98 for their lunch specials that included the entree, soup, and a mini tub of rice.  The distinction between Szechwan Garden and other places is that lunch comes out family style.  You have your own place, there are the entrees in the middle, and you pass around a tub of rice.  It allows sharing of others dishes which you usually wouldn't do.    I was really happy with this too.  I ordered the fillet in black bean sauce with tofu, and my friend ordered the orange chicken.  The orange chicken was tangy, crispy, and not overly deepfriend with a nice underlying orange taste from the zest.  The fillet was hot, tender, not dry, and hot (i know its sad when \"hot\" is a criteria).  My dish also had a nice spice to it from the black pepper, but it wasn't too bad that my friend couldn't eat it.  Service was fast.  Water was refilled often.  I liked this, but then I also thought it was too fast.  By the time our entree was on the table, she already laid the check next to my arm.  They kept repeatedly coming by asking if everything was okay and turning and leaving before I could really answer.  I felt like they wanted us to leave as quickly as possible so they could turn the table.  I don't get it, since there were still plenty of tables open.  Service aside, I would've given the place 5 stars, but the food is too good.  It's definitely my go to spot in Chandler for Chinese from now on.",

The best dishes I like is water boiling fish. It's not spicy at all. People can not take spicy food like me can actually fall in love with this dish! Tons of dishes that I haven't try yet.

Or I thought I did.  I usually order it, they go in the back, talk to the chef and I get my beef chow fun.  Tonight,, we came across a very rude, short bald guy.  He assured me they never had chow fun and that I must've went somewhere else.  He even went as far as showing me the menu.  I told him I knew it wasn't on the menu but they made it before.  I asked him to ask the chef, he refused.  Whatever.  I let it go and tried to order our other dishes but this guy kept talking about the beef chow fun.  At one point, I asked him to drop it.  Instead of dropping it, he proceeded to tell my mom that he could make it at home, but he can't bring it from home.  Really?  WTF?  Drop it dude.  We tried to continue to order but he kept talking about the beef chow fun and laughing at us.  News flash: We were there to eat and pay for our food.  Not be degraded and harassed by a lazy waiter.  We wound up leaving.    I will never go back.   I hope it was worth losing a family of 6 that has been loyal customers for 3 years.",

I think it depends on which waiter you get.  Nonetheless, the food is good.  Szechwan Palace over in Phoenix used to be one of my favorite restaurants.  I love spicy foods!  However, the past couple of times the food has been overly salty or not as tasty.  My parents informed me of Szechwan Garden and said I HAD to try it.  Rumor has it that the chef from Szechwan Palace left and opened up Szechwan Garden, but I have no idea whether this is actually True or not.  I must say I definitely was not disappointed.  Excellent flavors and it is much closer too.  I can't say that it tastes exactly like Szechwan Place used to, but it is up to par.  If you go you must order the 'cold platter' trio combo.  Go up to the front display and you can visually pick what you want.  My favorite is the spicy beef tendon.  As for dishes, I recommend the Kung Pao Chicken, very flavorful.  If u can, go for lunch, the dishes are cheaper than dinner and they are still very decently sized.  My parents go here like 3-4X a week and say the hot pot is amazing too, but I have yet to try it.",

    "text": "!!!Three strikes and Roach Motel!!! My husband and I came here yesterday for lunch. We were offered a table for 2 against the server's station with 1 chair clearly encroaching onto the server's mat. There were at least 3 other open tables, but when I asked to be seated there, the manager told me those were for parties of 4 or more people and that we would have to share the table with other guests if the restaurant got crowded. STRIKE 1! We have only had that happen once on a dinner cruise on Lake Michigan,  never in a restaurant any where else in the world.  Then, I ordered a Diet Coke. What I got did not taste anything like Diet Coke, and believe me, my dscerning taste can tell the difference between a Diet Coke and a Diet Pepsi. When I asked the manager if she had served me a Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi, she told me it was Diet Pepsi. STRIKE 2.  I would think it is common restaurant etiquette to notify customers that they don't carry Coke products and to ask the customer if substitute products are acceptable. The final blow was when, halfway through our lunch, a ROACH crawled into the center of our table. STRIKE 3. I immediately got our waitress to show her the ROACH . She simply stood there staring at the ROACH with her gaping mouth and made no move to do anything. I also went over to the front desk to notify the manager of the ROACH, but she refused to leave the front desk. There was no attempt made by the restaurant staff to address the ROACH, or our discomfort. We were quite distraught by the experience and the staffs' response that we did not have the presence of mind to take a picture of the ROACH. It may have been a good addition to this review and for lodging a complaint at the county Food Sanitation office.  Save yourself from the risk of unsanitary conditions and poor customer service!",

The waitress was very kind and checked on us periodically through the meal. Just enough! Their lunch is a pretty good deal. Plates are categorized by $5, $6, $7 categories. About 10 per category. And the meal comes with rice and hot n sour soup which was some of the best I've had. I asked for medium spice since I know this kind of Chinese food is known for the spice but when the dishes came they were very mild. But the flavor was extremely good. Now I know next time I can handle the regular spice. We got the ginger scallion beef ($7), fish fillet with hot chili peppers($7), and the eggplant in garlic sauce($5). We had PLENTY of leftovers between the two of us. All were great but surprisingly the eggplant was our favorite. Can't wait to go back to try more dishes!! :)",

    "text": "I'm a Sichuanese native who is very picky about spicy food. However, I was still impressed by their Chongqing hotpot (after I asked them to add extra spices).   The quantity was very generous, with a big pot of shrimp, meat, tofu, blood tofu, sprouts, fish fillet, tropes, and Chinese cabbage. It is more than enough for two people with good appetite.   Their soup may not be completely original (it tastes similar to those sauce packets you get from Asian markets), but the flavors and tastes are definitely there, way better than those fake hotpots served in Asian-fusion restaurants.   Their menu comes with great varieties of sichuanese food. I'd definitely like to explore other dishes next time.   One little suggestion for their  (cold chicken fish soaked in chili oil): maybe you can serve the sesame paste on the side as an optional sauce, since the original sichuanese recipe doesn't come with sesame paste, but only sesame seeds. The paste itself makes the chicken look more creamy and adds this thick flavor to it that might defeat the purpose of 'cold dish' served for hot summer weather. Plus, sesame paste, to my knowledge, comes from northern China and is not commonly used in authentic Sichuanese dishes. Just a thought.   Overall, I was very happy about my first encounter with this restaurant. Thanks!",

I love their spicy chicken/fish in chilli sauce. Probably they can replace the name with chilli oil instead of sauce. Sichuan peppers and chili oil just entice your taste buds. Perfect for a person with nose congestion ;) Another item which is irresistible is qong qi boneless chicken. It's like spicy popcorn chicken with Sichuan peppers and red chillies. You can't stop with just one. Spicy fantastic delicious guilty food :D",

Then we got the popcorn spicy fried chicken. Which is basically like a big popcorn chicken looking dish but with an absolute TON of dried peppers cut and put on top. The problem with this dish is the peppers are the dry type. So they don't let them sit in ice water for awhile before tossing them in so it's like biting into a piece of plastic. Not fun. Also NOT spicy. There was a ton of them. Makes the dish unenjoyable.  We will definitely go back and try other things. Skip the fried chicken.  Also skip the Spring rolls. Frozen little gross ones.",

One waiter pretends not to speak English well, but she does. She refused to take our order twice. Service is very slow and may take awhile.  The food is ok. I feel super thirsty after having a meal here so that only proves msg is in their food. Try the beef chow fun noodles. Very good and not filled with onions. The other dishes I tried were nothing to rave about.",

The chicken was neither spicy nor cooked well. Had a ton of red pepper thrown on it but when it is not cooked with it, you cannot get the flavor of red chilli into the chicken.. I re-tossed the chicken at home with a little Sichuan sauce(home made) with little oil and drops of water and the kids loved it. If you want spicy, I dont think this is the place..but if you want southern china or hongkong mild food, yes this may fit.",

Some dishes I always get at szchewan places are spicy water boiled fish(shui zhu yu pian), yu xiang eggplant, fu qi fei pian (it's a plate of three different items you can choose from the front counter and I'd recommend the pig ear, the beef, and kidney), and usually get the garlic string beans as well. For those of you who feel numbness or tingling in your mouth, that would be due to Chinese peppercorn which is what szchewan cuisine is known for!   The food is consistently very good but the service can be lacking at times. (Went for lunch and had to fill the water ourselves). If you're looking for authentic szchewan food though, stop on by!",

I would recommend the Eggplant in garlic sauce and a shredded pork with green onions. However, I have had almost the whole menu and loved most everything. For those that want even more authentic foods, they have a cold dish area where you can pick some prepared foods.",

The walls are red, the place is decorated with peppers, the food is full of peppers... etc.  There is no safe place here - virtually every single dish will nuke the unprepared from orbit with absolutely delicious heat.  I had a variety of dishes and unfortunately forgot the names of the vast majority of them, but I will say everything was good and spicy.  Only one dish - a shrimp dish - didn't have huge chili peppers added.  Everything was amazingly savory and spicy, which basically made it hard to stop eating.  The only negative from this food was the aftermath on my stomach - I literally ate myself until it hurt!  Service is good, but I can tell they are easily overwhelmed.  I suppose this is normal for places with only 5-8 tables.  That being said, be seriously warned - your entire dining party must like spicy food for this place to be a good choice.  If not, you'll be in trouble!",

Service: The kitchen was super busy cooking food for customers who were dining in as well as keeping up with the to-go order. Servers were trying their best to serve food as quickly as they could, checked up on orders and super polite to all customers. All of them speak little to no English, but I admire their hard working ethnic and politeness. If you don't speak any Chinese, please be patience with them.   Food: oh boy oh boy oh boy. I haven't had steamed dumpling and fried pork this good for a very long time. As soon as the dumpling came out of the kitchen, all 4 of us cleaned it in less than 5 minutes. The fried pork was so tender that the meat falls off as soon as you chew on it. The boiled fish was spicy as advertised, but unfortunately the fish has lost a bit of its flavor. We also ordered the hot & sour soup and it was absolutely delicious. You can tell that they aren't cheap on their ingredience neither.   Orange and kuo pao chicken isnt chinese food. If you want to know how authentic Chinese food really tastes like, this place is it! I cannot wait to come back here again",

Myself being Chinese American; the food options and variety was great even though we stuck to the basics. We ordered the beef chow fun, beef with broccoli, pork and cabbage dumplings, and another dish I cannot remember the name of.   The food came out promptly, steaming and served with white rice family style. The large portions were plenty for the three of us with leftovers to spare.  The only downside was it took quite a bit for the check. We didn't mind too much as we were enjoying each other's company but service could be better.   Overall it was a great experience with great food.",

    "text": "Who knew little ol' Phoenix - let alone a suburb of Chandler - would have more than all encompassing \"Chinese\" restaurants. As one to love spicy Asian foods, I was thrilled to find a Sichuan restaurant just right in the midst our neighborhood.  For my first time here, I decided to go with the staples: water boiled fish, Chongquing chicken, mapo tofu and threw in some scallion pancakes.  The food came out fast, yet freshly cooked and bubbling. All dishes were fairly flavorful...I wouldn't say the best Sichuan food I've ever eaten, but it still imparts your palate with that familiar, pleasant citrus tingly taste that I crave. I enjoyed both the fish and chicken, but the mapo tofu was very lacking uniqueness. And you can't go wrong with fresh scallion pancakes.  Service here is what I would expect. Flag the server down for anything you need, don't be surprised if you're reminding them a few times to refill water, but overall it's not the worst. When the food is good enough, service is only secondary. Overall, not bad Sichuan restaurant, and I definitely look forward to exploring more dishes here!",

The texture of the tofu is perfect and the sauce is powerful but not overwhelming.   The pan fried green beans are crispy and flavorful but are cooked with ground meat so if you're a vegetarian, ask for the green beans without the ground meat.   I wasn't a fan of the hot and sour soup nor the tomato egg flower soup which is why I deducted one star.   Their fried rice is flavorful and addictive.   Service is prompt and efficient though not overly friendly. I've dined in and taken out and the quality is the same. One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the area.",

My wife had the green onion ginger beef and I the spicy fish filet each from the lunch menu. The beef was among the best ever, and the fish, while delicious,, was somewhat too salty. The servers were welcoming and attentive acknowledging my halting Chinese with broad smiles. All of the restaurant staff were engaging and gracious throughout the entire meal. Large portions and good value for the price.",

I had the orange chicken which was overly wangy with a cloying citrus sauce and large chunks of orange peel that I accidentally chewed on (and spit out) a couple times. yuck. 10 bucks (including tax and tip) for chicken, white rice, diet coke, and a headache.

We have never been to a chinese restaurant that will make me wait for one hour for two dishes. I was so pissed I left before they make my food. I was there for 1 and half hour and we left hungry!!!

The place was clean and the kitchen is in a open kind of setting. I don't know how I missed It when I work so close to this place.  Anyways we were seated within 5 min and I went with the water boiled fish with chili paste. It definitely took some time to arrive and when it did, the dish looked totally fresh off the stove. I loved how colorful and yummy the dish looked. I took a bite with the rice and it was delicious. If you get over the spice from the dish, it can really be a great experience. However I felt it did miss few ingredients. I have tried this dish in few other Chinese restaurants and it had that tickling sensation on my tongue and this one missed that.   Overall I would definitely come back again. The quantity was a lot for lunch, when it costed about $9. I would highly recommend this place and definitely want to try other dishes.",

What we ordered (sorted by preference) -Eggplant with garlic sauce (91) was fantastic. The eggplant meat was really tender, but the eggplant skin was pretty tough but chewable. The sauce wasn't greasy, and it was the perfect balance of salty/sweet/spicy. There were pieces of ground pork in this as well. -Home style tofu (80) was tasty!! Tofu was super fresh, and I liked how they were smaller pieces of tofu so there was more fried surface area. Came with some veggies here and there; also contained some ground pork. -Hot and spicy shrimp (72) included flash fried, unpeeled, whole (with head) shrimp. The light breading on the outside was good, and the legs were super crunchy. Comes with veggies and some mushrooms. -Boiled fish w hot sauce (23) was alright - it wasn't as spicy as I hoped it would be. There was an adequate amount of fish for the $13 price tag, but it was a little limp and could have been a little fresher and firmer. The bed of napa cabbage it was on had bitter bits, which wasn't very pleasant.  I'm kinda sad the spicy dishes didn't shine because it's a Szechwan place (???), but I guess it's offset by the tasty veggie + ground pork dishes. Also, the quality of the ingredients used seemed kinda meh throughout. Will prob do takeout of the first two dishes in the future, but there's a better place for boiled fish w hot sauce (Szechwan Noodle)!!",

They had a decent variety in the vegetarian section so I wasn't hesitant to try it out.  Service - the welcome was warm and we could pick our own seat as it wasn't too crowded. They took our order within a minutes of us being seated but took forever to get our food. My order arrived and my husband's order took 15mins more to arrive. Pretty slow service on a non crowded Sunday eve. But around closing time they are quick uk get your bill (without you asking to have it) and a box (asking you to wrap up and leave even if you are not done): found it extremely unprofessional!   I read a lot of reviews raving about the spicy Ma Po tofu and do I decided to order it. I asked them to make it spicy and they said it's already spicy. When I took my first bite I tasted only salty soy sauce and no other flavor - definitely not spicy nor flavorful. The texture of the tofu was amazing though -melt in the mouth. But overall the dish was just inedible and they thankfully replaced it with vegetable lo mein with tofu.  The lo mein was the usual but definitely overpriced as I have paid half the amount at other places for the same but I atleast had something to eat. My husband ordered the Singapore style rice noodles with chicken, shrimp & egg which was bland again - even he couldn't manage to finish it.  They didn't even even have sauces, ketchup or hot sauce that we could have -plain weird. Not returning for sure!",

    "text": "Food came out fast and hot. I really wanted to try the mapo tofu when I saw the pictures on yelp. Happy it came out exactly like the pictures and the flavor was good. We also ordered the garlic eggplant and spicy frog legs. The eggplant was not overcooked or mushy. We wanted to be daring so we chose frog legs because you don't see it often on menus. Thankfully, the frog legs were cut up into little bite sizes so they look like chicken and taste like chicken. Probably more tender than chicken. It's not gamey either. You know it wasn't chicken because the bones are very small. Kind of cute lol but I didn't want to picture the frog in my head as I was eating lol. Also, I really liked the pickled bean sprouts in the dish. Very simple thing but added flavor to the dish. Definitely give it a try. It wasn't very spicy to me though. I should have asked for a side of hot chili.   What I think is most important to take away is that the dishes were not salty. Many times, restaurants add too much salt. Plus, Asian food usually have a lot of sauces that tend to be high in sodium. The dishes all had different flavors and none were too salty and I didn't leave feeling bloated.   One last thing. Some reviews said the staff weren't too friendly. If you're going to eat at an authentic Asian restaurant, know that most Asians have RBF. I noticed during dinner that one of the staff engaged in conversation with another patron and she seemed very pleasant. Also note that Asians are efficient, not corporate kiss a$$es. If the latter is what you're looking for, go to an Asian fusion place. It's not  authentic but if you're just going to order orange chicken or sweet and sour chicken anyway, authenticity is not the main focus.  Oh, seriously one more thing. It wasn't dirty like some reviews said. Maybe those ppl go to Asian fusion expecting authentic food and they majored in drama. Where we sat was clean. The decor is simple, nothing flashy. The table wasn't sticky. No bad smell. I didn't see any issues. I didn't use the restroom so I can't speak about that.",

The prices of their lunch menu have slightly increased over the past couple years, but still a good value. This is a great spot for lunch we always like to get a bunch of different things to try and then we have leftovers for dinner or the next day. The water boil fish is probably my favorite dish. It is very spicy with a lot of dry chili's and chili oil, but tastes really similar to the hot pot I've tried in the Szechuan province of China. Also a great place for vegetarian diners with really tasty veggie options including the fried salt and pepper tofu which is amazing! Will definitely be back soon",

The food is awesome. Our favorites include, the orange chicken, kung pao chicken, beef chow fun, and moogoo chicken.   The workers are all very friendly. The service is great. We have been there or did take out over 50 times since finding this place. If you haven't tried it, give it a whirl. You will not be disappointed.",

Both very spicy dishes.  Generous lunch size portions and great price. I think they must have a lunch price different than dinner price.  Total cost of both was $22. Was spicy with tingly tongue feeling from Szechuan peppercorns. Really good flavor.  Not a big fan of all the tiny little bones in the chicken but good amount of chicken to chili ratio. Will be back if I'm ever back in this area again.   Service was fine, nothing fancy but fancy is not needed with me as long as the food is good.  Enough room for larger parties of 6-8 as well.",

I think relatively speaking the dishes came out \"ok\" however they definitely weren't that great. I think the thing that irked me the most was that they have boba milk tea on the menu and I tried to order it during lunch. The waitress looked at me like I was crazy and abruptly said all they have right now is hot tea. I'm totally ok with someone stating that they are out of something, however to look at me with an angry distasteful look doesn't really create a good customer service atmosphere.   I would say given their price and speed of service they're ok, however I will likely not return due to the customer service and the fact that the food wasn't that great (plenty of other places nearby that are just as good if not better).",

I had a hankering for orange chicken so that's exactly what I ordered. The portion was large and the flavor was great! Just wish the chicken was a little fluffier, like Panda's but without all the chemical junk. Aside from the slight dryness/skinniness of the chicken strips though, the meal was spot on! And plus the large portion kinda compensates so it works out. I will definitely consider returning when I'm in the mood for Chinese again.",

I have eaten chicken all of my life and I know for sure 1000000000% that's not real chicken.

Sure, it's better than Wangs, and the place over in the Kyrene and Ray strip mall but it's not better than Gold Chef.   For one thing, the spring rolls are reheated frozen spring rolls; it's obvious! Pretty bush league if you ask me...especially for a restaurant that people are giving 5 stars to; they were mushy and cold as if they were reheated. There are no egg rolls on the menu and while some of you may respond by saying it's not a Cantonese restaurant...my response to that is...they offer other Cantonese items so why didn't you offer egg rolls too. I know a frozen spring roll like the back of my hand. The food also lacks seasoning. The flavors are good but it could be better. For a Szechwan restaurant, the food was lacking in heat and flavor. While it's good, it's also underseasoned. The fried rice is lacking flavor. When my wife had to apply Sriracha to her Szechwan style Chinese food...that's a bad sign!  But I will say this dishes are prepared well. You don't see any of the pale watery chicken dishes that you observe at most other \"good Chinese restaurants\" that you witness in the Valley. If you live in the immediate area, you will not be disappointed getting carry out but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",

All of the more \"exotic\" or authentic Chinese food is really fantastic food, and those are my favourite. Even though the service is a little slow (I attribute this to the servers not being able to hear because it's a very bustling, rowdy, restaurant), the food is so good that Szechwan Garden deserves its five stars!",

And after we ate she didn't come back with check so we went up to pay. We ate $18 of food and I was trying to write the tip down. And she showed us how many tips we should give: 20% 25%  Well I know we should appreciate the service but none was provided. But we still gave 10% tip. She said 'what the' and gave us the attitude... Seriously. She is sooooo RUDE!!!!! Horrible customer service!! Never going back and I recommend never going there again",

The shrimps must have been toxic and the eggs were not fresh at all. He was throwing up the night after eating this crap here, and then continuously puking and suffering from severe diarrhea day after day, night after night, even fainted a few times. This lasted a few days. He had never been this violently sick in his whole life.   The reviews are so inflated here... I'd say that the level of hygiene in this restaurant is highly questionable, if not downright appalling. I'd recommend that you go elsewhere for your meals unless you want to risk being poisoned by unknown toxins hidden in their dishes. Stay away!!!",

We ordered the Mapo Tofu, Fried Green beans, some sort of fried rice noodles that was dipped in a brown sauce (I didn't order this one my friend did so I don't know what it's called haha) Finally, my favorite fried Frog Legs in a medley of vegetables - Yum!  It was my favorite of them all.  Frog Legs are small but very meaty.  Plus, the spice they cooked it in was delicious!   Service was pretty good since my friend was a regular and I think they know her by name.  Oh the perks!  What I like about this place is that it reminds me of those old Chinese restaurants back in LA.  No uniforms and the staff ate their lunch next to us :)  The decors could use a modern touch, but the tackier the better I guess - Enjoy!",

I usually get the \"Fuqi Feipian\" and the beef tenders and any other dish. This with some rice is  good for lunch and some.   Finally a place to get my \"Ma La\" fix.",

    "text": "I've passed by this restaurant a couple times, and it has always been packed full of Chinese families, which is always a good sign.  So, I decided to try it out.    Overall the dishes were pretty good and lean towards the salty side.  Tonight, I had the \"three cold side dishes\" of pork stomach, pig ears, and tofu which were FANTASTIC.  The seasoning was perfect and the pig ears were sliced extra thin.  The second course was no.6 - live fish with peppered bean curd.  This dish was a bit on the fishy side, and while it is definitely cheap for a whole fish ($13), I would not recommend it.  Instead, try the beef noodle soup.  It is very flavorful and the meat is part fatty and part lean, just the way I like it.  It also went well with the pig ear side dish.  Finally I ended the night with the xiao long bao.  The skin was good but the meat filling was average.    Overall the service was good and the waiters were all very nice, especially considering how busy the restaurant was.  It was also a bit loud and cramped inside, but definitely worth a visit for the food.",

I ordered the lamb skewers to go, and was not disappointed! The lamb was cooked perfectly, and was spiced extra spicy like I requested :) My only suggestion is, do not walk in to order take out on a busy night (the weekends). They were backed up on to go orders and the wait was pretty long, but definitely worth it!!! I will be eating there again tomorrow!",

The guests are very demanding. I speak some chinese so I was able to pick up on a conversation when a group of 5 arrived who were also impatient to wait for a seat. They had asked the boss if people could be moved (who were already eating)  so they could occupy a group table. The managers gave in and asked people to move to another table. Some of the guests here can be real arrogant from time to time. I just wanted to smack those guests in the face.",

I generally like their food, though I had their beef noodles and was horribly disappointed.  It tasted nothing like the  I know and love.  Other downsides is that their restaurant is kind of cramped, especially when it gets busy.  Service isn't particularly great either: not mean but not keeping up with business and not proactive.  Also outside is a little stinky.  On the whole though, their food keeps us coming back.",

I am so glad that unlike place in San Francisco they don't nickle and dime you by charging for rice per serving.  We ordered Hot and Spicy Tofu, Fried Chicken cubes with hot pepper and hot and spicy pork kidney. All the dishes were amazing and the waiting staff was super friendly... as with all the good food places, it's pretty packed at lunch so plan accordingly.",
