    "text": "This place has amazing street tacos! Anyone who says different has never been to Mexico and ordered \"taquitos\" from a cart on the street and so they don't know what they are supposed to taste like.   + Yes, they are supposed to be small.  + No, they are not supposed to be crunchy  + No, they are not supposed to have sour cream or cheese on them  + If you think they are dry or need more flavor, that is when you add hot sauce, squeeze some lime on there, or add in some spicy carrots or garnish with cilantro, cabbage or radishes. Just like when you get a hot dog off the street in New York City, you can add toppings to your liking...   However, I believe that the way they serve these tacos here is perfect and they should be eaten as is. I have tried each kind and depending on the type of meat they have it marinated/cooked with different seasonings and topped with a different salsa that compliments the meat perfectly.   The rice and beans that come with the combo plate are also very authentic Mexican home-style cooking. I sampled the flan and I can say that it is definitely homemade though I didn't think it was that good. It is also a big plus that they serve Menudo and Posole all day long, even on weekdays. I have not tried the soup but my hubby says the Menudo is as good as his mom's so that is saying something.   Prices are also very reasonable. And the service was pretty good for an order-at-the-counter type place. The only reason I am not giving the restaurant 5 stars is b/c of the location itself. It is extremely small, to the point that while ordering and getting drinks from soda fountain you are bumping into people. Also, there are not many tables so you will have to wait if you dine in. The place looks like a dump, anyway, so I would recommend just getting your food to go. There are a couple of tables outside but you are right on the sidewalk of the shopping center, facing the parking lot. I wish I could take the food from this place and put it into a nicer location. Then, it would be perfection!",

They have the best Chile Reno Burrito I have had in the area. I order it enchilada style since they have great sauce.  The tortilla is soft and fresh made wrapped around a chile reno, rice, and potatoes. It is fantastic.  They have red and green sauce for all their food get extra green sauce, it's spicy and addictive.  The tostadas are really good as well if you want something crunchy to go with your tacos.  The staff are always friendly and the food comes out pretty quick for how busy they always are.  It's a pretty small place so it can fill up at busier times, but you can always get it to go and it's still just as good.  Try - Chile Reno Burrito - Green Sauce - Tostadas - Veggie Tacos - Ask for the habanero Salsa",

Maybe subconsciously I wanted to keep it to myself. Of course, with over 200 Reviews here they do NOT need mine, unless you want to know a secret.  THE SECRET: Having fallen in love with Tacos Pastor (and Mexican Coca Cola) at Asadero Norte De Sonora   (See my Previous Review) three visits ago I asked if they served Tacos Pastor (they are NOT on the menu) and one of the beautiful sisters advised that they did indeed. Oh my word! Nirvana, so close to home (Asadero Norte De Sonora is ten miles away). I knew I would be in trouble.  They are little (The Tacos) here, but have three or four and you will think you are in Heaven. The morsels of Pork are just right spicy and absolutely delicious! Wash them down with Coca Cola from Mexico and call it FABULOUS!   Prior to discovering Tacos Pastor I hade been VERY happy with the Carne Asada Tacos and as good as they are, NOT close to Tacos Pastor!  Do NOT miss this wonderful treat!",

We are constantly on the hunt for great tacos in any city, this was definitely one for our list.  We ate here for dinner both nights we were in town. The majority of the meals ordered were the 3 taco plates. One carne asada, marinated pork, and carnitas, served with yummy rice and beans- the tortillas were very good too. This is definitely the plate to get here. I think that the carne asada ones were the best.  Normally we order all of our food medium spiced, but beware of the red hot sauce that they put on the tacos. My daughter somehow got an extra dose on her tacos and was having a hard time getting through the burn. This somehow justified the obscene amount of Fresca's ordered. :) If you are remotely sensitive to heat, order your sauce on the side.",

I had up until this point settled on Fili B's because every taco shop in AZ I have tried has disappointed me. Until Los Taquitos!    I have now eaten at Los Taquitos 3 times! First time I tried Carne Asada tacos and Carnitas tacos, both were really good! The Carnitas tacos were moist and flavorful! WOW! We also had a quesadilla, and it was creamy buttery deliciousness. Have had both items a second time and I am still SOLD! Oh and their Salsa's are really good, too!   I also tried their Pozole, which was a good size portion and very flavorful, a little too salty for my tastes, but I would order it again for my Pozole fix!   If you are looking for a new taco shop...maybe you should find a different one because this one is mine now and I don't want to share! Just Kidding!   Oh and here's an important tip if you like Mexican food...Don't order Tamales at restaurants or taco shops, if you have had a real tamale made at home. They are always too dry and disappointing! And I don't think you can judge a TACO SHOP by an enchilada/tamale...try a taco or burrito...I truly believe that not everything at one restaurant can be great! In my opinion!",

    "text": "Food:  I've tried: chicken tacos, pork tacos, carne asada tacos, chicken burrito, guacamole, chips, & green salsa.  Los Taquitos has the best tacos I've ever had; their chicken tacos are my favorite.  I've lived in the Phoenix area for 21 years and eaten at many a Mexican restaurant.  Los Taquitos uses chopped chicken rather than shredded chicken in their taco & burrito (which is A+ in my book).  Many restaurants confuse heat with flavor, but not Los Taquitos!  The seasoning on their meat is so delicious, I can't describe it appropriately.  The tacos have your choice of meat cooked with the most excellent combination of herbs & spices; plus, fresh cilantro leaves, and diced red onion.  They are served in two small (street taco size) corn tortillas.  When I eat the average taco, I like cabbage or lettuce, cheese, sour cream & salsa.  But not at Los Taquitos!  Their tacos are so simple yet so flavorful.  I've been thinking about how good it was for the last week, and wondering how it would do if I used their food for a party?  The only downfall is I live about 30 min away and I'm not sure how it would be if not eaten right away.  I thought the guac had too many onions.  The chips were over cooked and bland (you couldn't taste the corn flavor which is so delicious in fresh tortilla chips).  I liked the chicken burrito, I probably wont have it again just because I don't really enjoy beans, I can take them or leave them.  I did like how the burrito did not have rice in it.  Price: Very affordable.  I did notice that online they have prices listed and the Phoenix location is more expensive and has a little different menu options.    Ambiance:  I've never been to the location.  My office brought food in for us on two different occasions.  (I must qualify my opinion of the tacos by saying that I do not care for shredded chicken.  Typically it has no flavor of it's own and has a slimy texture.   I prefer shredded chicken over shredded beef, so I usually end up with shredded chicken dishes at the average Mexican restaurant)",

It's basically ketchup with lots of spice, but wow is it good.  They should package this stuff and sell it!    I order the carne asada, but I'll warn you it isn't the best carne asada I've ever had.  It's above average, but sometimes overcooked.  It lacks sufficient marination and seasoning to be considered among the elite carne asada in the valley, but it's fresh and grilled to order, so you can't complain.  Their fish tacos are above average as well as their other tacos.  Their rice and beans are average as well, but nothing spectacular.  It's a bit over hyped, but I would recommend it just for the bomberro burrito and decent prices.",

    "text": "I'm all about the local haunt, and this one being literally down the street from me, I had to give it a try.  The one thing that I LOVE about Los Taquitos is that in Arizona (where people mistakenly assume that the Mexican food is good no matter where you go), they are proving that a delicious plate of food doesn't have to come at a premium.  You could go down the street to Macayo's and get a meal for twice the price and half the flavor.  More than price, value is king these days, and Los Taquitos knows the drill.  I tend to judge the quality of a restaurant on the goodness of their machaca, and Los Taquitos does an excellent job for the low price point.  In their burritos, quesadillas and tamales, the meat is flavorful and moist.  I second the vote of others on the rice and beans being tasty - I particularly enjoyed the rice in its fluffy, flavorful goodness.  It didn't taste like an afterthought.  Spring for the side of guacamole - it's a welcome addition to the plate, particularly if you're sopping up the whole mess with a bag of chips.  My husband and I ate like kings and didn't even manage to kill a $20.  That's some real majesty.  We'll be back for seconds, I promise.",

There is nothing glamorous at all about this place. Strip mall location, plastic tables and silverware, whole nine yards.  That said, the food really is fantastic and the price is right. I usually get out of there at lunch somewhere between $6-$8 and I aint mad at that.

Tried all four of their rolled tacos [chicken, steak, two diff types of pork] which were exactly what you'd expect from your prototypical place. There was very friendly service and they were quite prompt.  Luckily we missed out on the lunch rush, as it was Tuesday Taco Day [rolled tacos for $1] when we happened to arrive. The chicken chimi was the hero for the day, far surpassing the four different tacos we tried. Two house salsas available [green and red] that were good but not great. I'd definitely eat here again, but it isn't memorable enough to bring me in from out of the city",

One time while I was here, one of the customers was asking the waitress about the tacos after he had finished his lunch.  He was interested in ordering them some way that he used to order them, but that they had taken off the menu for some reason.  She told him that they still made them that way if you asked, and he got a little disappointed that he hadn't ordered those for lunch that day.  She ended up giving him a couple of them to go for free because he didn't know they still made them the way he was asking.  Nice service.",

    "text": "Tried Los Taquitos for the first time the other night and really enjoyed it. Definitely fast food Mexican but it was tasty.   I tried the sopas, one chicken one beef, with rice and beans. I've never had sopas before so I wasn't sure what to expect. They were kinda like tostadas but they're not on a hard shell, it's a softer, thicker base if you will. Each one was loaded with meat, beans, lettuce and cheese. They were very filling. Between the two of them and the rice and beans I couldn't finish. The beans were fine, simple refried beans. the rice was just okay. Not bad but I've had better.   The boyfriend ordered soft shell tacos. They were tiny. We've seen this before, there must be a certain region of Mexico that does tiny tacos? I dunno, it's kinda weird. They're like taco sliders. But he said they were good. So order several if you're hungry.  We went on a weeknight and the place was very busy. A constant line at the counter. The best was the guy who came in and asked if the order his wife called in was ready. The girl at the counter said \"what was it?\" and the guy answers condescendingly \"I don't know, give me a hint.\" Why would they know what your wife ordered dude? But they actually handled the guy well considering what a douchebag he was being.  I would go back to Los Taquitos but I don't know if it would be first on my list.",

The line apparently wraps around the building.  Located in a strip mall, the restaurant itself is very clean and modern.  Awesome paintings and decor throughout.  It took about 10 minute for 2 breakfast burritos to be made and served, but it was well worth the wait.  Upon unwrapping the steamy beast, it just looked like a regular burrito.  Biting into the flour tortilla released a perfect blend of cheese, chorizo, egg, and potatoes that sent the taste buds into a wild Jarabe Tapatio.  The heat from the chorizo lingered long enough to warrant another few bites.  Within three minutes, the burrito vanished into the neglected pits of my stomach.  This place warrants a pit stop if you're cruising into or out of Phoenix.",

My date got three of the street tacos - asada, pollo, & carnitas with rice & beans. He enjoyed them but said they were not spectacular. The shrimp taco had potential to be really good as it had the well-seasoned shrimp, rice, and sour cream, but there were way too many jalapenos in it. I like food that has a kick but this was almost inedible. I did my best to pick them out and added the beans to tone down the heat.

When we arrived the place was not busy at 6:30 dinner time.  The girl at the register was very new. She didn't know what some of the menu items were even. My wife ordered 3 chicken tacos,  and she got 3 shrimp tacos instead.  I tried the Carna Asada Taco combo, and a bowl of Passole. That was $23 with one Ice Tea. Not on the cheap side,  that's for sure.    Well after waiting about 15 minutes for our food, and the order being wrong,  my wife was not happy.  I have to say that the food was very simple,  and very traditional Mexican recipes, I found the Carna Asada tacos to be dry and lacking in flavor. The Passole was just homany, and pork in a thin red broth.  That's how the peasants make it.  The refried beans where not over mashed,  like most places make them,   but they put to much water in them to make them cheaper.  The Spanish rice was again very simple,  but good.   IMHO For the money there are lots of better places.",

They were pretty good! I got chicken tacos and they were seasoned very well. It had a nice kick to it. The only complaint I had about the tacos was that they were dry. I'm the kind of person who likes to eat their tacos with just cilantro but this definitely needed salsa. The salsa, by the way, was good! It complimented the chicken. I enjoyed it. The service was a bit mediocre. The lady at the register seemed to be rude to me. She was not having it when I couldn't decide what to get. I kinda wanted enchiladas but I wasn't sure. She seemed annoyed so I just went with the tacos to save myself from getting annoyed that she was annoyed lol but the service could have been better. Would I go back? Sure. They were good. I hope to stop by when I go back to Arizona.",

The chicken is good too but is grilled and not really marinated that much but I haven't tried it a lot.   The tortas are another goto item for me as well. The carne asada is my favorite.

    "text": "This is my go to place for a really good beef enchilada. The red sauce is always flavorful, and the combo with rice and beans will surely satisfy your cravings. Even the rice and beans are delicious, and remind me of home. I'm never afraid to just order a good ol' bean & cheese burrito. With their salsa verde, it is the perfect choice if you just want something simple. Of course, they do have carne asada, a typical staple for any Mexican food joint, and theirs is pretty darn good. I always get it as a quesadilla, and I'm always happy with the decision. Don't let their old school tables fool you, this place is full of good food!",

Meat:  Carne asada is great, chicken is great, marinated pork is nice and spicy, carnitas are awesome.  Burritos:  Basic but tasted good.  Bombero: Wow, what an experience.  It is spicy enough you don't really want the marinated pork as it's filler, but it is wonderful no matter what you fill it with, the spicy sauce that is poured over it is what maked it.  Tacos: $1 tacos on Tuesdays!! (except they do charge 30 cents extra for flour tortillas instead of corn)  Tastes like what I fell in love with in Rocky Point street vendors.  Enchiladas: Excellent, nothing fancy but made right and is so good.  Will update as I change up my choices.",

Love the flavor of the beans, but the consistency is too thin and watery. The service you get will entirely depend on who is working at the counter -- one girl in particular is amazing, the others average, and one is always terrible. The horchata tastes like red hot candies (cloyingly sweet with artificial flavor) so I never bother, but I like both their red and green salsas.

Los Taquitos is located in a strip mall, I know there many of those strip mall cafes that don't always work out, but Los Taquitos isn't one of those. Los Taquitos takes taco making to the next level. The decor inside Los Taquitos is reminiscent of a Dia del Muerte pageant. Once inside, you know immediately by the incredible aroma that you are in the right place for great tasting Mexican food.   On this visit I  tried each of the three tacos and a chille relleno.  Everything was delicious; the tacos pastor was incredible. The meat in these tacos was tender, flavorful, and practically melted in my mouth. The Carne Asada Taco is stuffed with bubbling, juicy bits of lightly marinated skirt steak, nestled in a warm homemade tortilla, delicious doesn't begin to describe the Carne Asada Taco. However, I couldn't possibly overlook the Al Pastor with its sweet meat, topped with onions and cilantro, so flavorful, moist, and delicious, I could have ate a dozen, and on Taco Tuesday at $1.00 a taco, I just might.  I would highly recommend a stop at Los Taquitos for lunch or dinner.  Nothing fancy; but really delicious food,great service, and wallet friendly pricing.",

Upon opening the doors I was welcomed with renovated and modern restaurant.   I ordered four tacos (asada, pastor, carnitas, pollo). Their tacos are typical street style tacos, served with two tortillas, meat, cilantro, onions, and salsa. Their tortillas are freshly made every day. Their flour tortillas are warm and crispy on the outside with buttery goodness on the inside (the corn tortillas are served with the tacos while the flour tortillas are served the burritos). Every single taco there was spectacular. The strongest tacos were the asada and the pastor. When I come back I will be trying the lengua.",

I could get faster service at a sitdown restaurant. The chorizo burrito was OK. I give it three out of five stars. It didn't have to much flavor to it. I did enjoy the quesadilla.

It burns, but I just can't stop eating it.  The sauce is delicious.  My other favorite item, is the pozole.  It's so amazing and the big chunks of pork are super tender and flavorful.  The last time I ate there, I had the bombero burrito and the pozole, the spice from the burrito combined with the heat of the soup had me sweating like a mad man, but it was totally worth it.  I'm glad I was able to introduce this place to some of my friends before I moved away, and I'm happy that they were able to expand this location and make it larger as well as open another location on the east side.

I then started getting busy and would order through Postmates and they would get my order wrong every single time. When I called to tell them about it they stated it's postmates problem not theirs. No apology no nothing. I then decided I was done with them. 3-4 months later I really wanted some tacos and came in to eat today on my lunch! I have no idea what has happened but the meat is sooooo gross now. It wasn't charbroiled like usual and it tasted like the meat was cooked in boiling water with hella fat. Low key reminded me of lengua and I HATE the texture of that meat. This time I didn't complain because I felt like what's the point?! They messed up my order with me even coming in. I can't find a good taco place that has bomb tacos like California and this used to be the closest thing to it. I guess I'll have to go to Charlie's on the weekends and eat at their food truck if I want better food cause this place sucks!",

I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream and my roommate ordered the bean nachos to go tonight.  Everything else in the order was correct, so I do not think this was a mix up with someone else's order.  My burrito had hardly any beans and a ridiculous amount of fried egg whites.  I found some egg whites within the first few bites and pulled it out thinking maybe they cooked egg whites near my burrito and it slipped in.  I was wrong.  The amount of egg whites in my burrito equaled the amount of about 4-5 eggs.  I placed my order via phone about 15 minutes before closing, so possibly they didn't have any beans left but this was not okay.  It was disgusting in flavor and texture.  If this is a new menu feature, please warn people because many are allergic to egg whites.  Taco Bell has better bean and cheese burritos.  Disgusting.",

    "text": "Let me say that I love their street tacos. The seating here was very limited, and people was always a line waiting to get their food. They were very good about getting people in and out fast to clear out the tables. The good news is they just re-opened after expanding, so there is twice as much seating. It also looks a lot less than a hole in the wall (which is one part that I liked before btw). Now there is still a long line. I don't know if it's because they have a lot more customers than they are used to serving, but we waited today for 40 minutes to get our tacos, and then we just ran out of time and had to get back to work. We asked for our money back and left hungry. No taco is worth waiting 40 minutes for, so I'm still giving this place 3 stars for old time sake. I'll give it another shot once a little more time passes and maybe they get used to serving more people. I will update this review if wait times improve",

They  have a great burrito, street tacos are delish and the salsa is super hot red or green. Every Tuesday is $1 tacos so that's a must.

    "text": "I don't know if Los Taquitos qualifies as a \"dive\". It's more like a fast food joint for authentic Mexican food. I mean, is in Ahwatukee, in the middle of a suburb, between a Safeway and a Walgreen's. Maybe compared to other restaurants in the area it is a dive I guess.....It's just that to me, a dive is kind of sleazy, maybe not in the best part of town and you feel a little dirty when you get out of there, and that can be good or bad (depending on what good of a time you had) Anyway, went there to try it as is 5 minutes away from me. Like others mentioned, it's a small place. I went Saturday night, people were coming in and out picking their food and some were eating there. I was too hungry to do take out so I ate in. Ordered a chicken hard taco, pork soft taco and carne asada sopes. Food took a while, which surprised me as they weren't really busy, but it was probably because it's made to order. My food was hot and steamy when I got it and it was goooooood!! Should have ordered more, my favorite was the sopes and carne asada. The salsas were flavorful and while I usually prefer red, I liked their green salsa better.  Service was prompt, the young women that worked that night were very nice.  I'm glad they're close to us, as we'll visit often.",

They give you like 4 choices of salsa in squeeze bottles for whatever your palette or mood which was great as I could combine a couple to get exactly what I wanted.

Dinner isn't so bad during week- busy wise. Now the food...my hispanic husband loves the place, as does my son...it's not that I don't...but honestly we eat there so often that I'm getting a little burnt out right now! That's a good thing - if you've never tried it before... YUMMY. Love the nacho's...messy- they are so high! Love the green chili - not hot, flavorful but not hot. My son tried the green sauce on his tacos once and they were so hot they were kicking his butt, so the kind gal that works there gave him a whole plate of cheese to tone it down. It helped a little...but how kind was that. Anyway--- please stay away...or if you have to go...save us a spot for 3! :) e",

My boyfriend and I went and as soon as we walked in it smelled amazing. There were quite a few people there but the service was fast and friendly. There seemed to be a lot of people coming in from the bike shop next door which is always a good sign.  I ordered the carne asada torta and a marinated pork taco and my boyfriend ordered 3 carne asada tacos and we shared a soda and it came to about $13. The food came out quickly and was hot and fresh. I do not like very spicy food and I thought that the spice was perfect. The hot sauce was great; it had a slight after kick and a great sweetness too. I personally thought that the carne asada torta was the best part. The bread was absolutely delicious. The tacos were great too, although I think the carne asada ones were better than the pork. I was not a HUGE fan of the tortillas, but they were certainly authentic. I just prefer flour tortillas I guess and should have ordered them instead of the corn.   I would definitely return to Los Taquitos and I am looking forward to trying other menu items!",

The room mate and I made the drive down one afternoon for some lunch hoping that the experience would make the 30 minute drive worth it. I was kind of surprised when we pulled up. From the outside it wasn't quite what I was expecting. The place is located in a strip mall and nothing really makes it stand out from the road...but figured maybe all the awesome was on the inside.   We get inside and there are quite a few people. There aren't too many tables and almost all of them were taken. I grabbed the only one available that someone had been recently sitting at and just cleared some of the mess left on the table away. I stepped up to the counter and placed my order for a chicken chimi. It ended up taking a bit longer than I would have expected, but when the food came out it was pretty good. Let me say this now, I'm comparing this place to the Filabertos and Rudolphos and etc. With that in mind, this place is great. The flavor of the chicken is unlike any you would find at those other locations I mentioned. If you compare it to that of items found at other diamonds in the rough, I think it falls short. It is for that reason I give this place 3 stars. If I lived closer to this place I'd eat here on a regular basis I'm sure since the food is not at all bad and the prices are worth it, however I'm not sure why this place ended up getting a spot on triple d.",

I found it a little odd that the counter where you order is so small and the drink lids, napkins, condiments and plasticware are right next to it.  If there had been a line it would have been very awkward.  I ordered a chicken burrito, enchilada style with rice and beans and a drink.  When I went to get my drink they were out of Diet Coke, it came out as just water.  Ok, I thought maybe they had been super busy as it was about 1pm on a weekday.  Lunch rush perhaps.  I took a seat and waited for my number to be called.  The burrito was good, nothing that knocked my socks off but a decent burrito.  The rice was nice and fluffly but the beans just lacked flavor.  They were blah.  Will I come back?  Sure but I will try the tacos next time and hope that they can rearrange that counter a bit.",

It may be a but mushy for some.  Carne asade was good.  Pork wasn't as good.  Arizona Burrito was hearty... lots of potatos cheese and steak.  The green sauce was tasty, the red was not.  Minuto was interesting, but I wouldn't get it again.  Just fill up with delicious tacos for under $1.50 each!",

    "text": "Our family ate dinner at Los Taquitos tonight after watching the great review it got on Food Network's program, \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.\"  The review by Guy Fierri was right on point. We had quite a variety from the menu starting with the Shrimp burrito that my youngest pronounced \"Oh, yummy!\" to the delicious red menudo thick with honeycomb tripas and a side of red onions, lime slices, and cilantro. My older daughter stated \"I'm just a menudo kind of girl,\" as she slurped down every last bit from the huge bowl she ordered. There was even  a  hot fresh tortilla to nibble on the side as well as home made pickled hot carrot slivers, jalapenos, and fresh cut lime quarters.  I ordered the Chimichanga dinner made with the succulant pork ala Pastor. The chimi was huge, very crunchy to the last bite, and loaded with fork tender chunks of pork and spices. Hubby had the three enchilada  dinner made with beef. The rice and beans were fairly typical Mexican restraunt fare, but the red and green sauces (which I believe were home made) and the special care that our server gave us more than made up for the so-so sides. And anyway, who cares about sides when the meats were all done with such care and tasted so wonderful? The only thing lacking at Los Taquitos is about 10 more tables as they are going to be so busy!!!!",

Yes, it is Taco Tuesday and the place is hopping, but the cashiers were quick, efficient and friendly.  Next time I'll make sure to call in my order!  Ever on the hunt for a good al pastor, I ordered a trio of the taco specials - pollo, pastor and carne asada.  Each came with a lovely sauce, onion and cilantro (of course) on some nicely cooked corn tortillas. The pastor rocked - leaning toward the savory side with just that bit of sweet to offset the heat.  Lovely flavor. All of the meats are flavorful and tender - the sauces have some kick! (I think I'm sporting a \"sweat moustache\" as I type.)  I also ordered chips and salsa for that nice crunch - just a very slight disappointment here.  The pico de gallo is on point - fresh, spicy and flavorful.  The chips were moderately thin and very crisp - too crisp today.  They were unfortunately overdone (and I'm not that chip-picky!).    All in all - HIGHLY RECOMMEND (but do yourself a favor and call in your order.  You'll get in and out quicker.)",

    "text": "Okay so, this is my first actual Yelp review. I usually just give things a 4 / 5 and keep it moving along. However enough is enough, we just couldn't let this one go.  Let me start off by saying that the review has NOTHING to do with the food and EVERYTHING to do with the (nonexistent / terrible ) customer service.  My husband and I have been calling-in the SAME order almost every single week for nearly a whole year, you do the math. Even though our orders were messed up almost every single time -- we kept going back for the food. And even though we always do take-out, we nearly always tipped an additional $2 / $3.   Today my husband placed our usual order. He goes to pick up the food and when he's checking it over, he realizes that one of the food items is wrong / not something he ordered. So he tells the girl that the order is wrong -- she ARGUES with him and tells him well that's what you ordered. My husband says well no it isn't -- I've been placing the same order nearly every single week for almost a year, why would I order something different?   The server gives him more attitude and places a new order -- verifying it 2 / 3 times with my husband before placing it.   When we get home, we realize that the order they had to re-do, the one we specifically told her NOT to put beans and cheese in -- HAS beans and cheese put into it... great. Since I'm intolerant, now I can't eat the damn food that took them two tries to give us and they still couldn't get it right.   We are have officially reached our limit and are so over this place - the food was tasty but your service is TERRIBLE. You've just lost some very loyal customers.",

I still think the tacos here can be the some of the best I've had in Phoenix, but last year the meat went from being the mouth-watering best you've ever tasted, to a little unreliable, like someone else here observed. It's the quality of the meat that really sets street tacos apart. I used to eat here once or twice a week, but the crowds and long lines, especially on taco Tuesday, sort of dampened my enthusiasm. I would recommend the carnitas street taco combo, with the beans and rice that are notably good, but also almost too salty and rich. The bowls are a bit healthier and fresher.",

I tried three different types of meat and my favorite meat is their red chili beef.   My complaints, when your order is ready, the hostess/cashier stands at the end of the counter and screams out the order number in a very screechy annoying voice which takes away from the ambience. In my opinion, the music type isn't suitable for the style or cuisine of restaurant.",

Everything has been excellent, and the red sauce ties it all together.    The only distraction I had was the service.  Maybe they were too busy, maybe the place is too small for people over 6 feet tall... i'm not sure what it was, but all the employees I've seen are cold, impersonal, and stiff.  It could also be a first-impression thing, because of an incident that happened during my first visit.  I had ordered and paid for my food, then I backed away from the counter so the next group in line could order (remember, this place is too small).  The employee yells out my number for pickup, and when I raised my hand, the cashier hands the tray to me over the heads of shorter customers at the counter.  I didn't mind since I'm a little taller than most, but I felt for the ladies under my tray.  If food is your thing, then you need to try this place.  If service is your thing, then you should keep searching for another place.",

The restaurant is a bit cramped during the lunch hour with the people in line to order tripping over the people waiting for their orders and all being elbowed by the people trying to either pick up their food when it's ready or fill their drinks (\"bit cramped\" was an understatement).

They don't overcomplicate anything. It's the tortilla, the carnitas, and the usual onions, cilantro, and hot sauce. Just enjoy.

Once I walked in I realized I had been here before a few years ago with a friend that lived in the neighborhood.  He really liked the place.    I ordered tacos, chicken, pork and carne asada.   I got an enchillada for the girls.   The girls didn't like the enchilada and the sauce seemed pretty boring and kind of sweet.  The rice was about as plain as could be, but the beens were kind of special.  They were closer to straight pinto beans then refried beans.  The were lightly mashed with plenty of bean chunks in a light sauce.  The bean flavor was strong.  The girls liked the beans mixed with rice and I enjoyed the beans and mexican cheese.  The chicken taquito was the best of the bunch.  The marinated pork took second but was a little dry.  The carne asada brought up the bottom.  It had a bit of a gassy taste and was far behind the great carne asada at El Sol.    The tacos here are small as the name suggests but three of them are plenty for a lunch.    I would like to go back for a Diablo burro and to try the fish tacos.  Overall this is an above average fast food place and the best place I have found for street tacos.",

First, I did only try their tacos and only 3 kind, I can not review the whole restaurant, but I figure these are basic foods so if it is a good restaurant, they would get it right. Again I had the carne asada, carnitas, and marianted pork. They actually only use 1 thick tortilla soft shell instead of the two, made it a little drier, different texture, I have had these before and like before, I felt they were inferior to the two thin tortilla. The meat I could not taste because they were covered up in their sauce. I don't know if this was the norm, I definitely did not ask for it. Anyway, when you smother something with sauce, everything usually comes out tasting the same. So they all tasted similar and bleh. I gave it a two star instead of a one was for the service, very fast, food tasted like it too and two the prices were a little less than the other place.   So I think for now I will stick to Sorenos grill in Chandler because it seems like the best around the area. Phoenix is another quest, too far though, maybe some times later.",

I also recommend ordering a torta with the refried beans in the sandwich.  They also have great soft tacos with carne asada or marinated pork. You will also find a few exotic plates like lengua (tongue) and barbacoa (beef from the cow's head).  Other pluses ... the two sisters that run the place are absolutely gorgeous. And it has a great atmosphere with Latin music playing in the background (not too loud either).  They will be featured on the Food Network in Diners, Drive-ins and Dives this upcoming season.  The only complaint I have is that their chile rellenos are average at best. Not a five star, but I have yet to rate a Mexican restaurant five stars in the Phoenix area.",

I'd been craving some better mexican foods because everything I've tasted was... sad. I was pleasantly surprised that this family owned shop was delicious. I love the bombero burrito because the sauce is spicy but still yummy! A lot of hot sauces are just spicy with no yummy.   This has officially become my mex spot. :D",

    "text": "Los Taquitos is apparently quite successful. I know this before I take one bite of food, because their children are running in and out of the kitchen and around the customers' seating area playing tag and sounding like what I imagine a pack of rabid chimps might sound like. Only people completely unconcerned about where their next paycheck is coming from have the luxury of being as oblivious to their customers as this. The stories I've read on Yelp back me up on this - lines out the door? The food must be stunning.  Guy Fieri certainly seemed to think so, but then again, doesn't he always. Me, not so much. I got the taco/enchilada/tamale combo plate, and nothing on the plate was more complex or interesting than anything I could get at Taco Hell for half the price. The enchilada was bland and boring. The tamale was dry, but at least there was bottled taco sauce to put on it, how nice. The beans and rice tasted like... nothing. Wet porridge and dry porridge? Cutting edge stuff - if you live in a nursing home.   The sole exception to this crap parade was the beef taco, which was extremely tasty. Too bad that even that was ruined by its size (just North of a silver dollar in circumference) and the fact that it had been unceremoniously dumped on top of the enchilada, rendering it too slippery to hold.  So if your idea of a great taco shack experience is eating two tablespoons of great taco meat with a fork surrounded by formica and fail, then you're in luck. For my part, I think I'll chalk this up as another Fieri fiasco. I doubt anyone at Los Taquitos will care - why should they? They've obviously got all the customers they need.",

Today walking into the place the tables were dirty and there was a smell in the place that said \" i need a good cleaning\". I ordered a Carne Asada burrito and when I opened it to add green sauce all I saw was a tablespoon of Carne meat. I took it up and showed the cashier girl. Her response was of bewilderment when she pointed with her pen at the tablespoon of Carne meat. I then explained to her that in a Carne Asada burrito the Carne is the main ingredient not the beans and salsa. They remedied the situation by adding more meat but I should have to go up and show them proper portioning. Another person in the party got nachos with beef. To me nachos mean the chips topped with lots of cheese and whatever else you add as a topping. Well needless to say the nacho chips barely had a tablespoon of cheese on them. Inconsistent food, dirty environment, rude staff and not a positive experience. Many a time I vowed not to return but this was my last visit. Too many places in the area that care about quality of food and customer service. I also worked in the industry so I'm familiar with what a customer wants and expects when they walk into a food esyablishment.",

I've tried all of the options and I think the adoboda is by far the best. For only a dollar, they are an amazing deal. I normally get 3 to 4 of them and I'm stuffed so 3 is probably the magic number. Here is my only knock on the place. It isn't fast food, which I know it doesn't claim to be but for an order at the counter type place, they take awhile to get you your food. I've been the only one there and it's taken 25 minutes for a few tacos. If it's packed, you might wait longer. I know this is a DDD spot so naturally you get people wanting to try it but I'm not totally sure it lives up to that long of a wait. I much prefer Carolinas when in the mood for a quick taco or burrito.",

The phone was raining with call in orders and the line grew. This was a good sign.  There is the over head menu full of the usual Mexican taco burrito total fare, and s small black board with specials.   I overheard the lady in front of me asking for a veggie burrito $.3.50 (a black board special) and to get it toasted.  I decided to do the exact same and added some chips for $1.    The burrito was great filled with beans, peppers onions and more. The toasting made it quite hot and added a extra crunch to the tortilla I could have lived without.   The hot sauce was still hot from cooking, a decent Smokey spice note and very thin, I really liked it. The chips came in a small paper  tray not much for $1 but they were good and thick.  Despite the crowd seating was decent with many 4 and 2 person tables in the long narrow setup.  There is a small soda fountain with the usual. And a free spiced carrots that were great, mostly spice not vinegar!   I will be going back to try other items.  Casual fast and decent quality.",

Really?  Food - I have been looking for a great shredded beef taco, and this is definitely not the place.  Cheap hard taco shells that are not cooked to order (think Taco Bell) - no wonder she had no idea of what a crispy taco is.  The meat essentially had no flavor at all.  This was my first time going to this place, so, in fairness, maybe they have better tasting food on the menu.  But I came to a place called Los Taquitos, looking for a great tasting taco.  I left very disappointed, and without any desire to return.  I guess my quest for the perfect taco will just have to continue.",

Both were so frikin good. My mouth was watering. And the green and red sauce they give you really take things to the next level. The tacos are pretty small so my boyfriend had to order some more food to fill him up and he got one of his personal favorites, tamales. He said they were some of the best he ever had. The prices are great too. Very inexpensive for such good quality.  We moved here two weeks ago and this is the one of two places that we have loved. Other places we have tried out lack flavor and seem to love to pile on the cheese and sour cream to make up for it.

I did not have any because the extra taco I had ordered for myself... was not actually in my order, so disappointment number one.  Service was OK but not particularly friendly.  2 - We ordered, sat to wait for our number, and people were coming and going... they seem to pay more attention to people with to go orders than to the customers in their dining room, which is a big turn off for me as a customer. Even a person in a neighboring table made conversation and asked what we had ordered, because he thought we were waiting for a while.  Hubby got impatient and went to ask (they were like 10 numbers over our ticket number) and he was told the delay was because of our 'big' order... yeah, 3 tacos, a bowl of menudo and a drink.  Well, the menudo was super hot... (are there any regulations about food temperature?  hehe) and in fact very tasty, but super stingy with the meat, I think they were leftovers and honestly they should have said 'we run out' instead of selling me a bowl of hominy. Well, I would have taken it at a discount, but not for regular price.  So, it would have been great if it was a regular portion, but it was like 90% hominy, 10% pancita, so that is a big no-no in my book.  We don't live anywhere close to this place, so I do not see ourselves coming back. Unless hubby really craves those awesome tacos one of these days.",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Ignore the fact that Guy Fieri showed up here and gave it a thumbs up.  The quality of the food here stands on its own and in my opinion, for the best food experience, you go for the restaurant's namesake and stick with the street tacos.  I kind of miss the old hole-in-the-wall feel this place used to have when it was half the size and really ragged around the edges.  Not that I dislike the update and the ample seating, but I miss the old mural on the wall too.  Anyway, on to the food.  Typically, I only get tacos here.  I will say that I've had the enchiladas and chile rellenos here once before.  The enchiladas were fine, a 3 out of 5.  Nothing special.  I was not a fan of the chile rellenos, they were under fried and kind of a soggy mess.  But the tacos redeem this place.  They stand up to very good tacos in LA and are a solid example of the great Mexican in the Valley.  The lengua, I believe, is the single best meat option there is.  Always flavorful, always moist and tender after it's long braising, yet you still get that slight chew from the meat.  It is almost perfect.  I also have a soft spot for the carnitas.  There are better carne asada and al pastor out there, but these iterations are just fine.  They keep it simple (onions and cilantro), as they should.  Thus, the goodness of the meat really shines.  My wife loves the shrimp taco, which I've never had.    The staff is always awesome and I will always come back here so long as the lengua never changes.",

It was perfectly seasoned, with a slightly tropical twist of pineapple added to the meat and marinade. It was a sizable portion, especially since I ordered it enchilada style, smothered with some deep, rich tasting red chile sauce.  Service was fast and friendly. Unfortunately, the soda fountain was out of order as the Diet Coke fountain only spurted out soda water.   Overall, this is a great choice if you want filling and reasonably priced Mexican food.",

    "text": "The two of us came here for lunch yesterday and found this taquitos place serving up some really delicious food. Now how did Mr Flavortown find it first?  As disappointing as our trip to The Dump was, coming here was a major plus.   While I was sitting in one of the chairs searching Yelp for lunch, I found my bookmark of Los Taquitos. Thank you, Lord. I promise to stay out of places like TD. Promise.   I vaguely remember an episode on DDD where Mr Flavortown recommended this place. What I do remember was Guy Fieri visiting a Mexican taquitos place that had five sisters making some great food from a family recipe.  I hadn't put it together until I was standing inline next to the spray painted \"Guy Ate Here\" smiling face (photo).  Here's a challenge. I dare anyone to find a place like Los Taquitos serving up as delicious food for the prices that you can find here. My Street a Tacos (see photo of their el pastor, el pollo and carne asada) were only $1.29 each and were outstanding with just the right amount of heat. And, my friend's el pollo burrito meal for only $6.99, which included rice and beans, was equally delicious.   So we enjoyed this trip to Flavortown and yes, Los Taquitos is a Four Star Bomb. Now do you think they'll miss a couple of squirt bottles of their red and green sauce?  Yes, Lord I'll put them back. Ugh.   Enjoy!",

They've definitely expanded and they added a ton more seating.  I love that they kept the murals on the walls, cause to be honest, that was the best part of their decor.  Their menu is a little hard to read and that might hold up the line, so guys and ladies of Los Taquitos, if you're reading this,  laminated menus at the start of the line might be a nice touch?  Customer service, once again, wasn't great, but I've lowered my expectations since my last visit.  However, I was pretty taken aback when a very cheery and polite lady handed us our food to go.  I almost wanted to thank her for actually smiling but that probably crosses some sort of line between normal and creepy so I kept my mouth shut.  Food, food, food.  My boyfriend got the burrito bowl, which was a little smaller than expected, but still tasted great.  Was expecting beans and rice on the side, but since you already get beans and rice in the bowl, I guess you don't get more (yes, I'm greedy).  I need to read that menu again.  The tamales with beans and rice were good, tamales a little dry and crumbly and needed some reheating by the time I got home (probably takes us 10 minutes to get home).  I am in love with their red salsa though.  It has a little bit of a kick, and everyone needs a little spice in their life.  Word of advice, don't do takeout.  It's still good, but from my experience, it tastes a ton better fresh.  Plus, soak up the atmosphere - it's a much livelier place than the hole in the wall it was before.  Though I kinda liked that hole in the wall...dammit, nostalgia!",

Some say the tacos are small but that is actually normal size in Mexico for \"street\" tacos (in Mexico they just call them tacos), and the price is pretty reasonable. It should take about 4 for a decent meal but I usually end up getting 6 or more just because they are so good. I've tried the carne asada, pastor, carnitas, and chicken tacos and they are all very good, with carne asada being my fave. Each taco consists of your choice of meat on double corn tortillas, topped with fresh onions and cilantro. I like that they keep it simple like it should be. They have bottles of green and red salsa made in-house, and some delicious marinated/pickled carrots, for you to self-serve.  I should note that they literally just increased their prices as of today (Tuesday 5/24/15). I went in for Taco Tuesday expecting to get them at $1 each, but they were increased to $1.25. Regular (non Taco Tuesday) prices went from $1.50 to $1.75 each (excluding seafood). Taco Tuesday applies to chicken, pastor and carnitas but not carne asada nor seafood items.",

Don't feel guilty buying multiple, that's normal.  The carne asada torta was also divine. I would recommend buying things al la carte rather than a combo. The combos tack on a couple dollars and you just get small portions of rice and beans. Instead, just buy more off the al la carte, it will be tastier and more value.",

You can mix and match meats-carne, pollo, pork etc.  I could have probably eaten about 10 tacos.  On my taco combo place (3 tacos, rice and beans) i chose 2 carne and one marinated pork. Both flavors were excellent. I think I may have preferred the pork slightly over the carne. Both meats had a little bit of a bite, which is nice.  I really liked the taste and texture of the rice. The beans were good, not my favorite refried beans I've had.   Coke products are served out  of the fountain. There is also bottled Coke and Orange Crush (personal favorites) among some other sodas..  The menu is pretty diverse and has all the standard fare-tacos, burritos, tamales, tortas, enchiladas etc.  Overall a great meal at a very reasonable price per dish.  Can't wait to head back and try other items!",

It's terribly crowded up by the counter, not a lot of room to order and pick up your food.  I do question how a place can call itself \"Los Taquitos\" and then not have taquitos on the menu, but I went for the flautas instead.  They were good, but what set the meal apart were the beans.  The most flavorful beans I have ever had.  If you told me these were magical beans, I would have believed it, but I wouldn't have stopped eating them to plant one and see.  Service was quick and friendly and there was plenty of seating, even during the lunch rush.  Looked like a lot of people get orders to go.  I'd like to go back and try a few other items on their menu, if they come with beans of course.",

Since Pozole can be made in so many ways I told the lady at the front desk that it was my 1st time there (she didn't even say welcome or glad you are here) and wanted to try the Pozole before ordering it, if she was able to give me a sample of it in a small cup (the ones they use for the salsas to go)  she said NO, we can't do that. It started off bad, so I decided not to order that and went for the \"safe side\" 5 different tacos (Carne Asada, Chicken, Pastor, Shrimp and Tongue) the only one that was pretty good was the Tongue one (it had the traditional flavor). Salsas are less than o.k. Carne Asada was dry, Shrimp didn't have ANY flavor at all. It didn't come with limes my plate so I needed to ask for that. They need to step up their Customer Service and maybe their flavor profiles. Not coming back, if the tacos weren't good probably pozole wasn't either BUT can't say since they couldn't even give me a sip of it :( sad so sad...",

Cheese enchilada was bland and cheese not melted at all. I can get that at any Filibertos. Salsas are good and a few varieties. They put a red hot sauce on everything which makes each dish taste pretty much the same. Pastor and carnitas (although they really aren't carnitas - fried) are your best meat choices. Chicken to dry.

You can pay upwards of $7 for a street taco in Scottsdale that will be overly complicated and not as good as these which 1/3 the price. The carne asada, carnitas and marinated pork tacos are both flavorful and tender, I suggest using some of the green and red sauce they provide to add flavor with a squeeze of lemon. If you haven't ever tried Lengua (cow tongue) this is the place to try it but I prefer the others mentioned above. The homemade tortillas are always soft yet don't fall apart.

But if you are a fan of spicy food - this is what to order (with your choice of meat of course).  It is a pretty good sized burro - I couldn't finish it all - and trust me, I tried.

It's in a mall (isn't everything anymore) and there's always plenty of parking. You might want to come before noon, though, if you are in a big group and want to sit inside. The place seems to be pretty popular after being featured in dumpsters, divers, and douchebags or whatever that program is called. I don't like going anywhere just because some TV program hyped it up. Might as well eat at McDonald's because you've seen their commercials so many times. Anyway, I've tried most of their street tacos and I'm partial to the marinated pork (Carnitas). Not sure why they have Spanish for most of their menu but instead of Carnitas it's \"marinated pork.\" It is an interesting recipe - includes condensed milk and coca-cola. That's the secret recipe. Well, either the secret's been let out of the bag or it wasn't ever that secret because when I googled Carnitas recipes there were hundreds with  those same two ingredients. Whatever the case, I love that flavor and I'm addicted to it. Is it really the kind of coke you drink or the other kind? Whatever the case, I like it and will keep coming back.",

I get the same thing almost every time...3 little carne asada tacos. OMG they are heavenly. I don't usually get a taste for beef but when I do I am headed here. The meat is tender and the seasoning is perfect. The rice and beans are great too. My only complaint is they don't give you enough rice and beans on those little plates.  One day I come into to get my usual and I see that Guy from DDD is coming to do a piece on Los Taquitos. I think great. The family works hard and the service is always great, friendly and fast. I come in months later after the show aired and I waited in a line practically out the door. The place was a wreck. However, the food was the same delicious Mexican food I was use to. I still go there regularly although I moved 15 mins away. As a matter of fact I have a taste for some taquitios now. Might be lunch. Anyway I have been back after my not so stellar encounter after the show aired. It appears my favorite Mexican spot is back to what I consider normal. Now a heads up this is a little whole in the wall place. So be prepared. I tend to find these places are the best.  If you are in the area definitely check out Los Taquitos and try my 3 little carne asada tacos. They are the best.",

I always go with a carne asada taco and a tostada.  The tostada was awesome.  It was literally like six inches tall with lettuce, delicious meat, beans, and cheesy goodness.    The taco was good too, but as I mentioned, there are a few places out there that are tough to beat.  The shop is definitely nice, and it's in a really nice area too which is a rare plus for me.

If you want fast \"Mexican\" food, go to Taco Hell.  This is a hole-in-the wall place in a strip mall that serves great food, according to the people who go there. Most of the lunch crowd were laborers and working types, waiting patiently for big orders of take out. The young woman at the cash register (wearing a tank top declaring, \"boobies rock,\" with a pink breast cancer ribbon logo) is pleasant and efficient. When she bellows out your order number you wonder where the sound came from. She just grins.  I've only eaten here once, I admit, but the marinated pork burrito was to die for.

    "text": "My 3rd review of a Guy Fiero-visited joint.. 2 here in Phoenix metro and one in Flagstaff.  This is TRULY a little strip mall dive.  Walk up and order, industrial-strength seating (i.e. hard/indestructible), etc.  None of that is a bad thing at all.. just trying to be sure everyone's expectations are set properly.  I wasn't sure if this was a sit-down joint or not, based on all I'd seen/read.  Now I know.  Frankly, I prefer it this way.  The tacos looked mighty good and I HAD to try them.  But I was also lured by the cheese crisp, with carne asada.  $6 for a combo with no steak, only $6.75 with.  Holy cow, there was a TON of steak in this thing, and it was humangous!  But it wasn't what I'd call a cheese crisp, it was really a quesadilla, at least by all of my past Mexican food experiences.  Nonetheless, it was pretty tasty, and a BIG meal by the time you threw in the beans & rice (which were very average).  I also got a chicken taco, on corn tortillas.  The tortillas are tiny, but they load the thing up with a lot of meat and fixins, so at $1.15 (!), they're an awesome deal, and VERY tasty.  On the Brak-o-meter, the taco rates a solid 5 stars, the cheese crisp a good 3.5 stars, and value rates 5.. for a composite average of 4 or thereabouts.  I wouldn't necessarly advise you to drive way across town for this place, but if you're anywhere in the immediate area or passing through, it's definitely worth a bite.",

My impression was not great, but I'll see if he liked it. $6 for a simple chix burrito is way overpriced. One of the reasons was I asked for cheese, which is an extra .50 charge. But that's all it was, just chix and cheese on a flour tortilla. I had them leave everything else off, so I was surprised to get charged  .50 for cheese. The girl who took my order didn't inform me when I placed order but I wondered why it was so much. After receiving my order I asked. If the burrito would have been a good size I probably wouldn't be complaining, but it was only average size. Seriously doubt I'll return since I can get more food for the same price elsewhere.

The Carne Asada Torta is one of the best sandwiches I've had. The Bombero Chicken Burrito is a chicken burrito that's covered in \"Bombero Sauce\". The Bombero sauce has an amazing flavor to it; it's kind of sweet and spicy at the same time, and unlike any sauce you've ever had.

I was disappointed, but after making a quick complaint regarding this, we ordered food and sat down. when our food was ready, I noticed that the tostada I ordered had a good deal of watery substance on the plate under the tostada. I ended up returning it for a refund, and decided not to order anything else. My wife's food was ok, but overall the trip there ended up being a mistake. the manager was not friendly (never smiles. ever.), and was not receiving their guests in a courteous way. and the staff is somewhat inept, if friendly. proficient and friendly customer service is getting harder and harder to find in this town, you really have to wonder at the choices that some of the establishments make for management. are they purposefully picking the stodgiest, unfriendliest, coldest people available?",

It was a tough call between two and three stars but, after the carne asada I just couldn't give it the third.",

I usually don't write bad reviews like this one, but in this case I need too because I was sick for nearly two days and had to call out work (which I hate doing) and btw ruined my perfect attendance. There must've been something going on with their cheese that made us get sick. I probably will never go to this place again or recommend it. It ruined my weekend and I felt really bad.",

Here's a little tip: if you order a margarita, order atop shelf margarita with the 1800 coconut tequila. It's a few dollars more but they have to make it by hand so it's not that premixed margarita mix. Sooooo worth the few extra dollars and the tostada is under $2!!! Like any taco place they have taco tuesdays but unlike other places Los Taquitos has the best pastor tacos!",

My brother, who lives in California, saw an old episode of DDD that featured Los Taquitos. He texted me saying we should check this place out when he's in town again. So I beat him to the punch and took my girlfriend to the Elliott Road location for dinner last week.  Having not seen the actual DDD episode, I previewed the restaurant's website and was impressed. And when we arrived, I was even more impressed. Los Taquitos is a modern, bright and cheerful fast-casual Mexican restaurant. Their specialty is street tacos and they have Margaritas y Cervezas to complement them! Oh, and burritos, tortas, tamales... I could go on. And the artwork is brilliant!  My girlfriend and I each enjoyed our selections. Hers was in a bowl and I tried a combination of the various taco fillings. There are home made salsas available, but you really won't need them. Everything is fresh and seasoned well. But grab a bunch of limes! You can't go wrong there.  And of course, I had to tease my brother about the fact that we tried his suggestion without him. But, happily, I confirmed that he knew a good thing when he saw it. We will be back! With or without my brother.",

I was awoken at 4 am that night in the hotel to the sound of my 18-year old throwing up the Chicken Burrito he had eaten that night at La Taquito and my wife trying to clean it up off the bathroom floor.

    "text": "We have been coming here for many years, and I think since it has gotten bigger it has gone a bit downhill as far as customer service. We almost always modify our orders, and although they have no problem charging us for it, I don't believe they have gotten the order right once in the past two years. If we ask for the food to be redone, it can be another half hour because they don't make a priority for what they screw up. The food is not consistent in quality, either.  The new, larger seating area is nice.  Some of the staff/owners who work the front are nice, and some are downright rude. They rarely clean the tables all day so bring extra napkins.  The restaurant is very close to where we live, but we have recently been discussing that we need to start going somewhere else.",

From the outside you wouldn't be tempted to go in, but I heard some very good recommendations, including the fact that a national tv show went there and gave it high praise. Trying it out however, I was BLOWN AWAY. First thing I noticed walking in is that the place was packed. All the booths were filled, and a fairly long line led up to the register. The next thing I noticed was the nice ambiance. Real latin music and a VERY NICE mural on the right side of the restaurant gave the place a nice feel. Check out the mural if you go in, IMHO it is something special (I was surprised that noone who worked there could tell me the name of the artist-I would like to see more of his work). Then there was the food. IMHO, every thing was both high quality-and authentic (no caucasian [I am caucasian] wimp down). Excellent beans and rice, and wonderful main dishes. I particularly liked the chilaquiles for breakfast, and want to try some of their other breakfast fare, which I believe will be amazing. I True Mexican (no caucasian wimp down) food lover, I will be back to this place many times and give it my highest recommendation.",

Let me start by saying that I love Guy's suggestions for the most part.  Salsa Brava in Flagstaff is excellent.  Everything Guy described and more.  The same goes for Chino Bandido in Phoenix, it's just as he described.  I tried Roberto's at the gas station that was also highlighted on DDD.  It's slightly better than Los Taquitos.  First off, Los Taquitos had no fountain soda, it was out of order. I ordered the 3 taco plate because the atmosphere was questionable.  The place wasn't as clean as I would like so I wanted to order safe.  My husband ordered the relleno plate.  My taco shells were burnt.  His relleno was soggy.  The only good part was the rice and beans.  I didn't see any chips and salsa on the menu either.  The bathroom was pretty bad too.  The floor was filthy and there was a hole in the wall that was stuffed with t.p. Don't get me wrong, I can slum it for some great authentic food but I don't see the appeal of Los Taquitos.  I felt ripped off and regret going.",

Then we saw the soda machine. It was dirty and looked to be backed up. Cloudy water filled up the bottom tray and was pouring out the side onto the floor where we had to stand in line. The caution sign was a nice touch.  We ordered the Carne asada burritos which is our barometer for checking out new Mexican restaurants. It came with a side of rice and beans. The food was bland and mediocre at best. The burrito supposedly had Pico inside but I think they forgot to add it or only put a tiny bit. The tortilla was powdery and tore as soon as I took it out of the foil. It's never good when a burrito had to be eaten with fork and knife. Lastly, the Carne asada was not appetizing at all. It tasted burnt and was full of gristle. We'll stick with the Original Burrito Co across the road. Their food has always been excellent!",

    "text": "My fiance and family went to Los Taquitos the weekend after Thanksgiving this year.  This place is literally down the street from me and for some reason or another, I have never stopped on by.    Meal:  Our group had the chimichanga, ranchero eggs, enchiladas with eggs, and the chiliquetes.  We also added had the chips with salsa.  Taste:   The seasoning was nearly perfect unlike other Mexican places nearby (like the Original Burrito Company), the food was both spicy and tasty.  It seems like too often that places confuse \"spicy hot\" as being tasty and well seasoned, but these places don't have the expertise in making something incredibly hot and delicious . . . but Los Taquitos does have that expertise.  Their salsa, in my humble opinion, is the best I have had to date and its by no means typical.  It appears they take real pride in making their salsa special.  The only dig is that the chips were overcooked.  8 out of 10.  Value:  Portions were more than fair and reasonable.  In fact, I would describe it that if you ate til you were full, you have a some left over for a small snack left over.  4 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  There is no waiter service, just a walk up counter.  The staff was mediocre.  They weren't rude or inept, but they sure weren't friendly.  It was sort of like a robot was taking our order.  7 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  The atmosphere is spot on of what you expect from a nice walk up taco and burrito place.  Nothing fancy, easy going, and great music.  The scenery is going to \"wow\" you but shouldn't district you from the entire experience.  3 out of 5.  Overall:  I have been to a handful of walk up taco and burrito places in the valley and Los Taquitos takes top prize.  This is the perfect place if you want some authentic, simple,  and fast Mexican food for lunch or after a night of drinking!  Its one of those places where you sneak away to treat yourself with an awesome plate of Mexican food.  22 out of 30 points, 3 out of 5 stars.",

Definitely do the carnitas on whatever you get. The Asada had a nice grill flavor. The Asada could have been slightly juicier but it wasn't dry. The pastor was good. Had a hint of spice and overall pretty good. The Asada and the pastor would tie for my second favorite. The chicken was nothing special and my least favorite. It didn't really have much flavor and was on the drier side. All in all pretty good but if you are willing to drive about 20 minutes there are a number of places that I would choose first. The price was right for the tacos at $1.50 each. You can fit 8 adults at the booths and there was plenty of seating otherwise.",

They have amazing rice and beans, and their red and green sauce is pretty decent as well. 10/10, would eat here 7 days a week if that wasn't extremely fattening.",

We walked in - total noobs to this place and checked the menu while in line.  We sat down for about 5 minutes before we heard our number come up and it was BUSY. Busy as in 5-6 people were ahead of us but we were ordering within 2 minutes.  The food is served on styrofoam plants that are cheap but the food... man I'm glad I found this place. I put this on par with Si Senor and Rosa's Taco Shop but... more casual if you can get more casual without losing clothing.  My favorite was the tacos - the street carne tacos are so well seasoned. And the refried beans - unique taste and very flavorful. And for $6 I got a plate of food that filled me for two meals easy.  I actually didn't see the Diners drive in's thing until we sat down and saw the painted stamp that Guy put on the wall. I had seen this in a few other places in town which was a good sign. I'm positive we will be back here several more times.",

I don't think it would be able to compete in San Diego, but in Phoenix, you have to take what you can get. I think I'd give this place a higher rating if 1.) The service was faster and if the people who worked there were nicer, more service-oriented and friendlier. and 2.) If they had salsa instead of just taco sauce. and 3.) If they had rice and beans or if they served free chips and salsa with their meals. Oh, and stay away from the carnitas. It was very dry. The carne asada taco is good, and the el pastor was decent.",

It seems like there's just a little twist to everything they do, like using red onions with the carne asada--atypical, but what a great combo.  They have special salsas for each dish, and you generally don't need to add anything, as the food is packed with balanced flavors.  The burritos and tacos are kick-ass, and the horchata is awesome.

Took it home and mowed, I repeat, MOWED it down! I got one chicken taco and two carne asada and they were equally delicious. The refried beans and rice were fresh and authentic and, lucky for me, served together in a separate container, which made mixing them extremely easy.   My only complaint is that I loathe all varieties of onions, especially finely chopped red onions. So I specifically requested no onions, then I made the mistake of not checking before bolting out the door. Of course, since I got my tacos to go, once I got home I found finely chopped onions on 'em. The kind that would take 3 days to pick out, so I just ate 'em. Still amazing!   There are a lot of cool little local eateries in this area and this one definitely ranks at the top for me. I'll be planning many return trips to sample some of the other things on their menu.",

The real gem at this little place though are the Carne Asada Street Tacos ($1.15 each!) . Perfectly marinated meat, not greasy, high quality, and served on the most delightful little corn tortillas.  I've eaten a lot of BAD Carne Asada in my life, and I'm thrilled to finally find a place that makes it so well! My co-diners had Shrimp Tacos, and a combo plate that had a tamale, enchilada, rice and beans.. both of those were under $7.... they were good, but I'll say again, Carne Asada is the *star* at Los Taquitos. I even had a few more Tacos for dessert. :P   Bright, joyful, warm staff... seats are tiny, and so is the dining room.. but I'd sit on the side of the freeway to eat food from here, if I had to. :) IT IS SO AMAZING.",

If you are a follower of mine, you have probably learned by now that I have an obsessive personality, especially when it comes to food. The problem is, it is SO good here I JUST CANNOT STOP.  I cannot eat the a-la-carte Chile Relleno anymore (not vegan), but it is so freaking good and I really wish I could. My friend recently got it in burrito form and I think it was True love.  Dallas G. loves the bean burrito with a little guac on the side. There is something about their beans that make you salivate just thinking about them.  But, here is what just makes my soul sing: The three hard taco combo. I get it with beans (no meat) and no cheese, and add pico. I get all beans with no cheese on the side. I lather that ish up with the green sauce, and suddenly all is right in the world.  The clock just struck 8:30am... guess what that means? That's Right! TACO TIME!",

I've been 3 or 4 times and have taken out of town guests here as well.    I LOVE the tacos. They are incredible.  Prices are very reasonable.  My husband generally orders a burrito of some sort and the quesadillas are way bigger than my kids can eat.  I have two kids (1 and 3) and I'm glad I don't have to worry they are going to break anything (there's nothing to break..) - plus they do have high chairs!  We found it by looking at the Diners Drive-in's and Dives website. We have yet to be led astray by Guy Fieri!",

It had a good portion of meat, beans, and rice (except no cheese..arrrgggghhhh HULK SMASSSHHH!!!!!) and the cilantro and onions complimented the burrito.   They could do with a bit less salt on their meat  and perhaps the burritos could be a bit bigger (then again I eat like a 400 pound man so I can't judge small portions.)  I will definitely be returning there again in hopes of getting cheese to go into my burrito. Would recommend this place as a good lunch spot :)",

The street tacos at Los Taquitos are more like the type that you would expect to get in Mexico. The carne asada is fabulous, and the pastor (marinated pork) is awesome as well. On Tuesdays many of the taco selections are dirt cheap. I'm also a big fan of their pazole. Some of the other menu items seem run of the mill to me though. To sum up, it's all about the tacos!",

I saw the piece on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives where they made a big deal about their variety of salsas and how people came from miles around to buy them.  Seriously?  They had exactly two salsas.  Again, they were fine, but nothing special and nothing at all like what we saw on TV.  We ordered chips and salsa and got a small little french fry tray of chips with no salsa.  I asked the girl at the counter for salsa and she pointed to the same two bottles. Ah, ok.  Woo hoo.

    "text": "My boyfriend recently moved to Ahwatukee and we'd been on the lookout for another dive-y Mexican joint to replace our beloved El Bravo in Sunnyslope. After hitting two pizza places on a Monday night, both of which were closed, we made our way over to Los Taquitos. It's a bit easy to miss, tucked between the Safeway and Walgreens on Elliot and 48th st.  Right away, the place showed promise. Total dive-y interior, but without being dirty or unwelcoming. Counter service, formica tables/booths, fluorescent lighting, etc. We ordered and sat down to await our hopefully-tasty dinner.  While this place is no El Bravo, it was very, very tasty. We both ordered the #31, a Chimichanga combo plate (he got the steak and I got the grilled chicken), and fountain drinks. All total, the bill was under $19! I was pleasantly surprised to notice that the chimis were served with sides of sour cream and guac at no extra charge. Tasty guac, too, if not a little salty. Excellent rice and refried beans. So many Mexican places seem to serve the rice as an afterthought, but here it was very flavorful.  The chicken in my chimi was very tasty and cooked well. My bf's steak chimi was very good, the meat had a great grilled taste. Two kinds of bottled salsa on the table, one green and one red. I only tried the green and it wasn't that flavorful really. Just sort of spicy.  We were really glad we finally made it to Los Taquitos and hope to come back soon :)",

A lot of people love that, I'm not one of them. I just order it without cilantro and problem solved! They have delicious enchilada sauce, so I get enchilada style!  We rarely eat there, it's usually pretty packed and there is not a lot of seating.   They are always courteous and have only gotten my order wrong one time. They made it right and apologized.

There are colorful murals on the walls, actually pretty cute.   The employees were friendly and helpful, and my co-eater and I both got a combo and a sope. I would say the tacos were the best draw, followed by the enchiladas, then the tamales. The rice and beans were tasty too. The sauce on the enchilada and tamale was delicious. I really wish I was able to try more. This place is on my to-do list for the next time I'm in the area!   I hear they're putting a Los Taquitos outpost in PHX airport.

And neither can the order takers or kitchen staff because on both of my recent visits I received the wrong orders. The staff is so befuddled they agree the business is in meltdown mode.  Plus...let me mention the quality of the food has dropped considerably.    This long-time patron WON'T be coming back!  I've put up with the dirty, worn, decrepit interior for these years because Ahwatukee lacks a quality mexican food place near my home but I won't tolerate a menu that's incomprehensible and food that's worse than Taco Bell.    To top it all off, the staff has become rude, probably due to frustration over how management has let this business go to ruin.",

We came here on a slow night and didn't really get much since we ate a big lunch. Thank goodness we got the tacos because they are arguably the best tacos we have tasted. Carne Asada and Al Pastor tacos hit the spot! Crunchy, juicy and small enough to devour in a few minutes. By my description you can only imagine how much we dream about this place.  There isn't really more to say but to try this place. Food was top notch, service was friendly and the place isn't too pricey. My only regret was not ordering more tacos to take with us home.",

Then, a few bites later, more eggshell. Then it happened a third time. I cut open the burrito and found another piece of shell that would have covered most of a dime. So I went to the counter and asked for a manager. There isn't one, I was told. An owner? Nope. So I described the problem to three women who were up front and showed them the shell. They stared at me like I had a second head. So I gave up and rejoined my wife. But then I got annoyed and went back and said I wanted a refund -- after all, I'd given back most of the burrito. The clerk said, \"Let me call the manager.\" Yeah. I waited there to talk to this mystery manager but heard that she was too busy to talk to me. That's the kind of people who work there and who run the place.",

I ordered the 3 taco combo plate with rice & beans, along with a fountain drink--price came to just over $9. My friend ordered essentially the same but with chips, his order came to $11. This place feels like a fast food place to me, not a restaurant. $11 bucks is too much for fast food IMO. For me, prices get a  thumbs down.  There was a large group of people near the register waiting for their orders, we found a seat & waited too. No kidding we waited for about 40 min for 6 tiny tacos, chips, beans & rice. We had a gig at Cactus Jacks, which shares the same strip mall so we actually were trying to kill time but under normal circumstances--I would have asked to be refunded. A few people complained about why things were taking so long. I don't know if that is typical service, but I'm gonna have to give it a thumbs down.   The food was actually pretty good, but Not worth a 20 min drive for me. If I happened to be around that area, I might stop in & try a few more menu items. Maybe.",

The posole was good not as spicy as I like but that was fixed with some Tapatio sauce and then it was great.

    "text": "My co-worker and I stopped in on the recommendation of other co-workers for Taco Tuesday. We arrived shortly after noon and there was a line out the door. We had a debate on sticking it out since we only have 45 minutes but the line appeared to move quickly so we stayed. Our mistake. While the line did move fairly quickly that was about it. We both placed our orders. I ordered 3 carnitas tacos (at $1.00 apiece on Tuesday it's a great deal!) and chips and guacamole. We both placed our orders to go. Time on my receipt was 12:23. Ok- we can do this. We have a small window now but it was doable with a to-go order. Or so we thought! We did not get our order until 1:11. While we waited there was plenty of time to observe. Orders sat ready to be packaged to go for many minutes while the in restaurant guests received their orders first. Typically someone who places a to-go order is in more of a rush than a dine in customer yet they received priority. Talking with other customers it was discovered Tuesday's are normally busy. Heck we even tried to call in our order from the line to speed it up and they declined. The gentleman in front of us left. He returned later and saw us still waiting for food so he left AGAIN! His business was lost twice on one day! There must be a better and more efficient way to handle Taco Tuesday when your business is tacos. Finally 30 min late returning from lunch (thank GOD for an understanding boss), I sat at my desk to eat my tacos and chips/guacamole.  The tacos were really good. The carnitas was tender and had a good flavor. A bit more spice then I was expecting but it wasn't over powering. The onion and cilantro on top helped add to the flavor. Very good tacos. I don't know about worthy of a 45 min wait from order to receiving good but they were good. The chips were nice and warm and lightly salted. The guacamole was decent. Not spectacular but not horrible. I'd like to return on a day other then Tuesday and see if service is quicker and try some other flavors of street tacos. There's room for improvement however it wasn't completely a disaster. The tacos made up for some of it.",

    "text": "I may have had too high of an expectation for this place due to the reviews & recommendations from the hotel. I felt this place was average nothing spatular about it.  I tried the carne asada, chicken & pastor street tacos. They all tasted great, but no better than any other place that serves street tacos. The beans had great flavor, but were so runny I had to eat them with a spoon because a fork made a big mess.  Rice was average.    I have been to several of Guy's stops & must say I have never been impressed & this place was no different.  I actually thought the ladies were rude who took my order & gave me my food.  There was no line when I got there around 1125, but by 1130 the line was out the door.  I noticed almost everyone ordered either soup or a burrito, so maybe I just order the wrong thing. If I lived here I would try it again and get a burrito next time, but I don't so my first impression is all I have.  It's worth a try if you are in the area, but I didn't think it was quite 4 stars.",

    "text": "I feel rather pathetic that I don't write more reviews, but I have no choice on this one.  I was looking to try a new Mexican food restaurant and someone had referred me to this place.  I came in (interior is nice/well setup -- I would assume renovated over the last year or so -- sort of reminds me of a modern-style Chipotle) and ordered a Carnitas Burrito with beans and rice.  Upon ordering, I looked up to find an AC vent covered (more like caked) in dirt.  That grossed me out (shockingly, I still placed an order).  While I waited, I noticed another AC vent near the soda machine that was caked in dirt/dust/who knows.  I felt bad and didn't want to embarrass the 18-year olds at the front, so I called once I got into my car to let them know and was rather shocked the owner(s) haven't noticed their vents or any employees.  Hmm...hopefully they take my advice and seriously clean the vents or if it's too late for that, take them off and spray paint them white or BUY a brand new vent.  The food:  The burrito was weak -- only comes with onions and pico (odd because if you get one, say at Chipotle, you can get guac, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, black beans, etc).  Seems a bit odd for $5 not to allow additions.  The carnitas alone were fairly fatty, so not good at all.  The rice was good.  The beans were watery and a bit too salty -- I believe someone else that left a review for Los Taquitos said the same thing.    Overall, not good.  I'm shocked based on the fact that these recipes came from Mexico (owners are apparently from there and brought family recipes to their restaurant via the website).  You get more lettuce, tomatoes, cheese at Taco Bell.  Now, that's pretty sad isn't it?  I won't be back.",

    "text": "While visiting Arizona some co-workers of mine were recommending places to eat when the name Los Taquitos came up. With Mexican food being one of my favorite types of ethnic eats I knew while in the area I would definitely have to give this place a try and I'm glad I did.  Situated in a safe and standard strip mall sits this spectacular site sure to satisfy your stomach. I walked in to see some very nice art of what appeared to be Santa Muerte or some other skeletons on the wall and placed my order. Per a recommendation from a co-worker I ordered the \"bombero pollo\".  Once my order was ready it was time to head back to my office and consume this.  The bombero pollo was a chicken burrito with some hot sauce and cheese on the outside, I also got beans and rice with it. To start with the entree the hot sauce on the outside really gives this a lot of its flavor. It's fairly hot and I was warned ahead of time, but I'm no chicken, I merely eat chickens, on a burrito. The chicken and other ingridients were good, a little watery. Overall I was very impressed with the bombero pollo as the hot sauce was a great compliment.  The rice and beans left a little to be desired. These tasted worse than the ones I get at my local Mexican restaurant in suburban Chicago. I'm willing to take a stab in the dark and guess they were frozen and thawed out due to the somewhat bunchy and odd consistency of bean dip. That's not to say they were bad, just not ideal or on par with what I've had other places.  Overall, I really liked the Bombero Pollo, the hot sauce gives it a fantastic flavor. I'm a big fan of Mexican food and this place was fantastic and I would highly recommend it if you happen to be in Phoenix looking for some caliente lunch or dinner. Cinco stars for Los Taquitos.",

A friend had an event catered by los taquitos and the food was great. When we had a going away party for my son heading off to college, I was looking for Mexican food that could be catered. I called Los Taquitos and they were super flexible, helpful and friendly. I decided to order and went to pick the food up as scheduled.  We were a few minutes early, so we grabbed a breakfast burrito. We were blown away! It was phenomenal! Fresh, flavorful, big, hot, absolutely delicious! The homemade salsa's were the same, fantastic! We knew we were in for a treat with our catered food and so were our party guests. We were not disappointed!  The atmosphere is open and clean and comfortable, casual, easy. Feels very homey.  Our catering order included Carnitas, Carne Asada, rice, beans, chips and salsa. They were all second to none. The meats were incredible, fresh, flavorful, the beans were super tasty and authentic, the salsas were fantastic! Several of our Mexican friends commented how authentic and fantastic the food was. We had quite a bit of leftovers and ate it nonstop for several days after the party and never grew tired of it.  I understand this restaurant is owned by several sisters and it was incredibly clear they care greatly about the quality of their food and the satisfaction of their customers. They were friendly and helpful and personable, made for an outstanding experience all around!  I do have one regret. It's that I waited so long to eat here!  What I eat here again? Absolutely, unequivocally! Do I recommend that you try it? Same answer!",

It's similar to other set-ups where you walk-in and order at the counter, snag your number, and pick-up your food to-go or grab a table or booth to dine in-house. I found this restaurant based on my fellow Yelpers' reviews. Gotta say they hit this one right on the mark. I'm a huge salsa nut and when I saw squeeze tubes of their red and green salsa I knew the food had to compliment the heat. I haven't had a bad meal yet. They're shrimp burrito is stuffed with sour cream, spices and Mexican rice. It has a kick of fire, but manageable for those that waver on the medium to mild side of the scale. They're enchiladas are covered in sauce and paired with a healthy side of rice and beans.  The Bombero burrito with pollo is rockin' along with the chicken tamales.  The refried beans are awesome, too.   The interior is decorated in bright colors and is a Day of the Dead wall theme. Not to mention an industrial atmosphere. There isn't table service, but the food makes up for it.  It gets busy during the lunch hour, but they put out the orders pretty quickly. I've ordered ahead by calling and found it to be the fastest way if you're in a hurry. My only wish? I would love to see them on Grubhub, Doordash, etc. They're missing out!",

    "text": "UM HELLO. Where have I been all this time?!! Tacos here were great! Had lunch here during the week (12pm) and the parking lot was crazy full. I wasn't sure if everyone was at this place or somewhere else.   We ventured in and we quickly realized that the full parking situation was because everyone was in here getting some food! We got in line and started looking over the menu. The line was about 9 people long so we had time to look over it.   They have bowls, tortas, burritos, tacos, a three taco plate that comes with rice and beans, and I also saw that they the have menudo and posole, YUM.   I decided on four chicken tacos and my husband decided on the three chicken taco plate. The plate runs about $7 and each taco individual runs about $1.50. We each got our own drinks and those were, one soft drink and one agua fresca (Jamaica) We spent about $18.   This place was chaotic inside. Finding a table was a challenge as there were a ton of other customers looking for somewhere to sit as well. Luckily, we found one right when someone else was leaving so we sat down quickly.   We waited about 15 minutes for our food and they called it out by number. Our food was nice and hot so we quickly dug in. My chicken tacos were delicious. They were already dressed when I got them (cilantro, onion, and a green salsa) and so if you don't want any of the toppings make sure to let them know.   My husbands beans were really dry so we didn't eat them. The rice was a little bit over cooked so it was a bit soggy. The flavor was good though so we ended up eating it all.   They don't have a salsa bar but I did see red and green salsa bottles on the front counter. The inside of the restaurant is nicely kept and they had several tvs on as well as music. It was very loud on this day as there were a ton of people dining in.   Don't come during lunch time if your in a hurry but do make it out to try the yummy tacos!",

    "text": "After consuming too many leftovers of turkey post-thanksgiving, I had a hankering for some Mexican food and decided to give this place a try.  Location & Aesthetics -- located on East Elliot Road in the same compound with Safeway.   There was good signage from the East Elliot Road and even within the parking lot area as well so not difficult to miss.  The area outside of the restaurant was clean though there wasn't any outdoor seating.  Within the restaurant, it was also clean, including tables and booths. As you enter, you will have to walk through the seating areas in order to proceed to the ordering area/checkout. The restaurant was well lit, with adequate noise levels.  There were flat-screen TV's on the walls but they were on mute. Seating area was large with the center of the restaurant with tables and seats and the periphery with booths, and plenty of space in between.  Service -- as we approached the ordering area/checkout, we were greeted and were given enough time to take a gander at the menu and mull over our choices, and thankfully there weren't any patrons behind us.  Staff was also friendly enough to answer any questions we had about the menu.  Menu -- very easy to understand unless you may not be familiar with the cuisine itself and some of the terminology, in which case, the staff was very helpful in answering.   The menu was large and conveniently placed on the wall, above the cashier.  Food -- I had the street tacos -- asada, carnitas, pollo, and an extra taco - lengua.  The three street tacos either come by themselves or as a meal served with rice and refried beans. The tacos themselves were the average size for a street taco however it seemed as if the ingredients that was supposed to be within the taco was lacking, e.g. the minced onions and/or cilantro.  For some reason, I didn't taste too much of it at all. In addition, the meats like the asada didn't have that charred flavor that's supposed to accompany it from the searing that is done.  The carnitas was supposed to be soft and tender, but to me, didn't taste as such.  The pollo, in my opinion, needed some more seasonings; and the lengua was dry and needed more seasoning. The rice was bit on the dry side.  The refried beans was not too watery or too dry and had the right consistency though a bit on the salty side. Finally, for drinks, I didn't see horchata or jamaica on the menu.  Sadly, food loss a point here (-1).  If I am to return, I may possibly try their quesadilla or burritos.",

    "text": "Growing up Mexican, I have pretty high standards for Mexican food, and this place delivers.   Food: Absolutely delicious. I recommend the al pastor burrito. It's so good that within the first bite, I instantly wished that I had fifty more. You could taste the pineapple in the meat, which is so tender and not lacking in flavor at all. The burritos are a good size, big enough to leave you full but not Chipotle-sized. Both the red and green salsas are incredible. The horchata is delicious; I usually find that a lot of horchatas have the problem of being super sweet, but this one has just the right amount of sweetness and cinnamon flavor.  Service: Many people are complaining about the wait time, but every time that I have come, I have never waited for longer than a few minutes. I've never thought that the employees were particularly rude, just as polite as they needed to be.   Decor/Cleanliness: They have recently remodeled and I must say that it's a nice upgrade. Before, the place was tiny, a very hole-in-the-wall establishment with not much room for seating. However, now they expanded into the business next door and it looks a lot more open and airy. They also upgraded their signs and menu board to look a lot more sleek and refined. The only thing is that in their old place, they used to have a huge mural that I really loved, but with the remodel, they had to tear down that wall. There are still murals of La Catrina and such, but I really loved the last one. Very clean, never once questioned how hygienic the place was.",

We found this place and yelp and expected it to be your traditional mom and pop type mexican cuisine store.  We obviously didn't want to go to any nice sit down place looking the way we did after running around town for 24 hours.  We got into the restaurant and realized how nice it was!  WHOOPS!  But we were also so tired and hungry that we just didn't care at that point.  The motif inside the restaurant is very hip, colorful, and inviting.  They had some sort of hispanic edm type music playing which was definitely a first to my ears! I ended up ordering the carne asada burrito (minus the beans inside the burrito) and a side a rice and beans.   Also with a horchata to drink,  First I must say the horchata is probably the best I've had in town!  If you're ever in the area, it is a MUST! I'm normally not a fan of beans, but I've been trying to increase my whole grains recently so I decided to just attempt to eat a small portion.  I ATE THEM ALL!  They were so good and savoury I just couldn't stop.  By the time I got to my burrito and rice I was almost full.  I took one bite of the burrito and was greeted with such amazing flavors of meat!  Top it off with their salsas and you've got one of the best carne asada burriots I've ever had!  I unfortunately had to put it down because I just couldn't eat anymore.  I ended up saving it until the next day, where it tasted just as good!  I cannot wait to come back and try their other menu items :)",

Everybody in Ahwatukee raves about how this place is the best & most authentic mexican food in the valley but they obviously have not ventured out much. I'm giving this place 1 star due to the number of people who ride or die for their food & me being disappointed when I tried it. The menudo is under seasoned, I had to add a lot of salt & crushed red chili to make it some what descent. (We also found an eyelash or eyebrow hair in the menudo) The chicken in the taco was dry, the carne asada tacos are under seasoned & the carnitas tacos were just basic. The carne asada burrito includes dried beef & all you can taste is red onion. The salsas do all the heavy lifting but even then the tomatillo (green) salsa taste only like lime & the red lacks flavor as well. It's sad that this is what people who live in Arizona call authentic. If you live near Ahwatukee & crave tacos, at least try Salazar brothers which isn't far in Tempe, but if you want amazing tacos & willing to get out of Ahwatukee for the real deal I highly recommend Tacos Sahuaro in Phoenix.",

I got their tacos and some chips and salsa and guacamole. Omg, so delicious. I can't wait for the chandler location to open so I can try them for lunch when I'm working, yay!! Also I absolutely love the art work they did to the inside, it's very SoCal and makes me feel like I'm back in San Diego. Very very good, I will keep coming back!",

The beans and rice are authentic and although the rice tastes the same as other Mexican eateries, the beans are on their own level. The carnitas are my favorite taco item as the meat is seasoned and cooked very well. The el pastor and grilled fish options are also delicious. Employees are friendly and the the restaurant is kept well organized.",

The chicken was a little overly spicy and inconsistent (and I like heat) but the carnitas tacos were perfect.  Served on soft tortillas, rice and beans each cost $1.69 + tax extra.  Would return for the tasty tacos but would call ahead next time and skip the line OR order a ($4) margarita for while i wait for my order.",

The rice and beans with the meal are pretty yummy too.  My only complaint is that they often run out of flan and agua de horchata... But I call before making the trip.",

I went with an order of super nachos with carnitas, a carne asada taco, and an al pastor taco.  Total was right around $12.00.  You order at the counter, get your receipt with your number on it, and then grab a seat.  They call your number, you pick up your food and devour it.  Here is how everything was...............  Super Nachos w/Carnitas-  This was the main reason I had this place bookmarked.  Their nachos looked bomb, and had great reviews.  Everything was spot on!  They give you a HUGE container full of chips, refried beans, carnitas, cheese and then guacamole and sour cream on the side in little containers.  This beast of a dish was only $7.50.  The nachos were fantastic!  Probably the second best pile of nachos I have found in AZ (Cafe Rio is still my number 1!)  Their beans are delicious!  They look weird, almost pink in color, but they were tasty as F!  The carnitas was moist yet had the crisp edges on it.  I will definitely come back specifically for just these!  Carne Asada Taco-  Small, double tortilla street taco.  Carne asada was pretty tasty.  Comes topped with onions, cilantro, and a red hot sauce.  Could have ate about 5 of these.  Legit!  Al Pastor Taco-  Same layering as the carne asada one.  Didn't like this one quite as much as the carne asada, but it was still good!  Overall, a great meal!  One of, if not the best \"taco shops\" I have had in AZ.  The nachos were incredible, and the tacos were delicious.  I will definitely be back, soon!",

I think my favorite part about this restaurant was the artwork on the walls. The restaurant was pretty empty when I visited and from what I can tell, it appeared spotless. Service was decent.

I love their asada and pollo street tacos, perfectly spiced with the green Chile and lime. I'm not a fan of the beans, they've never had much of a taste so I just stopped paying for the combo meal and opt to buy another taco or two instead. Also not a big fan of their asada quesadilla, mainly because the meat tasted like a Burger King hamburger, which isn't a bad thing, just more a disppointment when you had a craving for good asada. Can't drink margaritas right now, but when I could, I loved the prickly pear margarita. Went with everything so wonderfully.",

We tried the fish tacos, shrimp tacos and carne asada tacos. They were all very good and the shrimp and fish were especially fresh! The rice and beans were authentic tasting like we make at home! Also, I ordered a cheese enchilada, I got hit red sauce half green and it was really good too. They have beer and margs which is a bonus too! We will be back for sure again!",

I had the three carne Asada street tacos with rice and beans. And one fish taco. The flavor was amazing from the first bite to the last. There's a flavor I can't identify that makes their tacos different, and better, than a lot of other places that make similar food. They also have about six different margaritas to choose from at reasonable prices. Also, I got my food to go so the picture is after the to go container was openedI'll definitely be back again.",

    "text": "Let me first say that I spent hours looking for chimichangas in Phoenix at 730pm on a Friday.  Locating the lost City of Dorado may be an easier task, so I jumped for joy when I came across the menu for Los Taquitos.  They service chimis with various fillings, enchilada style upon request.    The restaurant is easy to find from the freeway, and there is plenty of parking.  The walls are full of colorful murals, and the menu is extensive.  The cleanliness was questionable, but it didn't turn off our party from the chimichanga goodness that awaited us.  Orders are taken at the register, and the women we spoke to was helpful and pleasant.  I ordered the shrimp cocktail, my boyfriend ordered the chimi with sauce, guac, and sour cream. We shared the chips and salsa.  The red salsa is full of smokey chipotle deliciousness, but we were unable to secure a bottle of the green salsa.  The pico de gallo was bland, a solid 2/5.  My boyfriend enjoyed his carne asada chimi, but I thought the meat was burnt and could have used more oomph.  My shrimp cocktail was weird.  The shrimp were hot, the sauce was cold, it was a mess.  I don't recommend it. Overall I'd say it is asi-asi.",

They are pretty small, even for street taco style, but I don't give a crap. I could pound 9 of those things in one sitting no problem and not have any issues. I also had a carnitas taco, which was good too but the carne asada is hands down the way to go. I also had a carne asada burrito, which was okay, but the flour tortilla was kinda bootsy. Stick with the tacos! Also, the staff here is SUPER friendly and the food comes out in a timely manner.   Here's the kicker... I'm from California and was just in town for biz. I know Mexican food obviously so this stands up to any of the joints around here as well. I ACTUALLY ORDERED 6 TACOS TO GO AND TOOK THEM HOME WITH ME ON THE FLIGHT BACK TO CA. That's right, the tacos are that good. My girlfriend tried them, even a few hours old, and said they were delicious. Of course, getting them right off the grill with the tortillas with a light crisp is the best way to go!",

Anyway, tried the rolled tacos and they were actually superior to all other rolled tacos I've had. I don't know if they put sauce inside, but it tasted like they did. Very good flavor. Howard had the carne asada burrito, also had a very different and spicy, smoky flavor than any other carne asada we've tried, but small for what he likes. Although, the price was like $3.95. There were people standing waiting for tables, but it worked out perfectly and we were able to sit and get served quickly. Would definitely go back.

    "text": "Service 5 Food 3 Cleanliness 3 Atmosphere 3 Value 4  Pros: Good value Quick Service  Cons: Little Greasy  Was trying to find somewhere close to eat and landed here. I had seen it on DDD before but have learned that doesn't mean great food.. just.. interesting food. I have no real complaints. The service was quick, the prices were low, the food was decent. The whole experience was just above average. With so many other great places in the valley I an unlikely to make a return visit anytime soon.  Onto the food:  Chile Relleno: The sauce was great, the breading held up pretty well. It was slightly undercooked so the pepper was still very stiff. Had to hack away at it with a plastic knife to cut a piece. As usual it was filled with cheese.. and unusually filled with diced potato. This was a new one and I'm not sure what it really added to the dish. Initially I thought maybe just extra filler to cut down on the cheese needed, but there was plenty of cheese. Good but far from the best.  Hard Shell Tacos: This place is known for its street tacos. So just stay away from the hardshells. You'll be glad you did.  Street Tacos: Carne Asada: There was a lot of bold seasoning going on here. Street tacos are notoriously two/three bite'ers so I didn't really get to break it apart. If I went back I think I might get a burrito to really get a good amount of the carne. I sometimes worry when things are so obviously heavy seasoned that they may be covering something up.  Al Pastor: Very strong citrus flavor. Almost like the marinade was made with fresh juice that had been cooked down and condensed. It was very salty and pretty greasy.  Carnitas: Not to bad.. Had a decent flavor but again was a little over salty/greasy.  Rice: Decent  Beans: Really liked these. They were very rich and creamy but still with some whole bean texture. I'm not sure they can taste that good without lard but I suppose its possible. I've never been afraid of lard anyway ;)  Cheese Quesadilla: Flour tortilla filled with mexican white queso. Was decent but nothing to super special.  Green Salsa: Bold, spicy, and very heavy tomatillo flavor.  Red Salsa: I liked this one. It was a good combo of smokey, spicy, and a hint of sweetness. The smokiness I'm sure came from a heavy dose of chipotle.",

I think to my self Guy was ranting about this spot... So I head over for lunch and it's really busy so I get to the counter and order the # 1 all Carne Asada tacos I go find a table and drink my drink my number is called I get my food and look at comment bar there is no salsa so I have to ask... I ask for both she seemed kind of bothered. Let me tell you these are no write home about tacos the salsa on the other hand I could drink both kinds it's really good. So I am not sure if I will be back anytime soon with all the other options out there... DDD just lets me down every time.",

    "text": "Made out to Phoenix again last month and again, managed to hit up Los Taquitos on our last day there. This time I had a shredded beef chimichanga, and of the three I had while in town (also went to Valle Luna and Filibertos), it was the best. It was also the smallest but that isn't necessarily a bad thing since most Mexican food place have such huge portions. And at $6.99, it was a bargain. The young lady at the counter was friendly and helpful.   I have to get my fill of chimichangas when I am in Arizona because here in Texas, they tend to put all sorts of stuff in them and smother everything in queso and red sauce. i also have to get my fill of green sauce because what we have here isn't as good. What impressed me is that when I bought some green sauce to bring back, both the young lady who took my order plus the lady who was on the Triple D program took the time to make sure that what I bought would retain its freshness and how to properly freeze (then bring to a boil before cooling) it to store what might be left over after a week. I appreciate the extra effort given since they both knew that due to my location I can't be a regular customer.",

    "text": "Another winner for Ahwatukee!    This morning I had to run to the grocery store to pick a few things and decided to get some major points with the BF by bringing home a breakfast burrito!  I got there around 8:20 and saw on the door that Los Taquitos doesn't open until 9 on Sunday.  No biggie, I thought.  It should be around 9 by the time I'm done at the store.  So I take my time browsing the grocery aisles to ensure a 9 am departure.  Walk in the door of Los Taquitos at 9:00 exactly and am successful in getting order #1 for the day!  Chorizo and potato for him, tacos for me.  As much as I love the breakfast burritos, I find them a little too heavy for me first thing in the morning.  So I started getting two tacos instead.  Usually, I get one carne asada and one chicken, on corn tortillas, of course!  The meat is delicious, the taco is tasty, and it's a perfect way to indulge in the goodness of Los Taquitos without feeling like I need a nap right after breakfast.  The service is quick and friendly, the place is clean, and the salsa is good (I prefer the green over the red, or both)!  As Guy says \"winner, winner, chicken dinner!\"  Well, I know he isn't the only one that says that . . . but he does work it in quite often!  Ok, and this isn't exactly a chicken dinner . . . but, you get the point, right?  Just go to Los Taquitos! =)",

I appreciate that they have taken their time to grow slowly and maintain the integrity of the food and the original concept. I get the same quality of food whether I'm at the Ahwatukee location or the 16th street location. I'm loving the newly remodeled Ahwatukee location!  It's so much larger, has great character, and some of the artwork has been carried over. My only negative, and it's small, are the prices. They're a little more expensive than I'd like and that means more time between visits but I totally support this place!",

The other day, they mixed up my order with someone else's & that person left with my food. Accidents happen but I was annoyed to be waiting for all my food to be remade & I wasn't told outright about what was going on- I had to hear the other person calling back saying they had the wrong order. Ultimately when I brought up my annoyance I was met with apologies, prompt service & a refund. I'm so used to apathy at a food counter & I was pleasantly surprised with their willingness to rectify the situation as best they could in a timely manner & I really appreciate that kind of service.",

    "text": "To be fair, I have not been here since the renovation, so this review is solely based on their food and customer service. I noticed that they changed their sign outside about a month ago I think, so I guess that's what ya'll are referring to. Moreover, ambiance and size don't make a difference to me unless they greatly impede or considerably improve the enjoyment of my meal. When I went, the location did neither, so my opinion on the matter is neutral.   So unless their food changed with the renovation, this review will be helpful. On second thought, I would like to add that the floors did not look very clean. Not in a nit-picky sort or way, but in the way that the edges of the furniture and some of the walls looked grimy and dark. Hopefully that was improved by the renovation.   Let me begin by saying that I know what truly good Mexican food is. This is NOT truly good, authentic Mexican food. It's not gross or anything, but it's definitely nothing special. Honestly, the biggest turn-off for me was that the meat didn't have a good, grilled taste. It almost tasted like they had used liquid smoke to give it a grilled flavor. My husband thought the same.   However, thumbs up for customer service. I asked for a slight change in one of the orders and they fulfilled my request without a fuss or even an extra charge, which I was willing to pay but was told would be unnecessary.",

Works better on a chimi than a burrito, I think, because the sauce makes the burrito tortilla \"wet\" and does not have the same soggy effect on the fried shell of the chimi.  The carne asada last night was smokey and awesome.  It has not been this good on my prior visits.  It was pure, smokey goodness this trip.  The chicken hard-shell tacos held together better too....after falling apart last trip.  I wonder if they changed their shell a little?  Anyway, they were delicious.  A word about the \"salad\" too - it is that micro-shredded lettuce and a few tomatoes and a little white Mexican cheese sprinkled on top.  And it was all perfectly fresh and delicious.  The beans again were better than your average refried beans - something about them I can't place for sure, but they are delish.  The staff was great and friendly.  I'm gonna spend more time eating here.  It's pretty darn outstanding....",

    "text": "What started as a food truck back in the 80s, has now evolved to two successful restaurants in the valley.  Using traditional recipes passed down through generations in Mexico - LT delivers the flavors that reminisce of street tacos in Mexico.  Using ingredients made from scratch, the marinades used for the various meats are outstanding!  Being first timers there, the service staff was very friendly and suggested what menu items we should try - to experience the best they had to offer.  Our number one dish was the #1 (about $6 or $7) - an assortment of three street tacos with chicken, pork, and beef.  All of them had unique and bold flavors - you could taste that the marinade had really absorbed into the meats.  They were served with cotija, pico, and cilantro - adding that truly authentic flavor to the tacos.  We also sampled the fish tacos and burritos.    Why this wonderful little place does not receive four stars or more?  Despite what Guy Fieri said, despite the wonderful flavor of these tacos, everything we ate was lukewarm or less.  From the refried beans to the rice, to the taco meat, and burrito.  It gave us the sense that despite being made from scratch, these wonderful ingredients had been sitting there for a while.  Albeit the flavor and texture of the meats was grand, it did not taste fresh.",

After the 4th time they gave me the wrong thing, I called them to express my dissatisfaction with their inconsistency. They offered to give me a credit for my order and told me to just mention my name when I came in the next time.

Los Taquitos has to be my favorite of all from top to bottom.  Walking in, I got the feeling I was in San Luis RC or Rocky point joint.  There's enough seating for a lunch crowd and a few outdoor seats when it gets crowded (or too cold inside).    I ordered the Combo plate which came with three meats, beans, and rice.  I also got a side salsa, and I made a quick grab for the usual red salsa in a bottle.    The three meats were flavorful and distinct.  I liked the beef which had a nice char to it.  The beans were the usual, but the rice was amazing.  It looks normal, but it was buttery, soft, and melted in your mouth.  The side salsa they give you is also a standout.  It was very fresh with a hint of sweetness to it which I'm wondering if it could be a pickled melon?  Hands down it's the place to go when I get a craving for Mexican food in the East Valley.",

    "text": "We were looking for a place to go have dinner since we had gone to Arizona for the Dodgers spring training for the weekend. We were all craving Mexican food. One of our friends who lives out here recommended this place to us so we googled it to get the address.   We got there and took at look at their menu, it was a hard choice. Everything sounded too good!! But I guess cause we were super hungry. Well we ordered not knowing what to expect.  It didn't take to long to get our food either wit it being kind of busy and only 2 people working the front floor. We sat down took one bite of our food. And let me just tell u! It was beyond bomb!!!! for it being our first time we were impressed. They meat has a delicious taste to it. We would definitely go back when we're out in Arizona.",

Beans were creamy, salsa was a fresh pico de gallo, chips were crispy, and the pastor was succulent and a little hint of spice. My mom ordered the steak fajitas and they were well worth the wait. The meat was tender and flavorful and the onions and peppers were caramelized and perfectly seasoned. The rice had such a great texture and hint of flavor that I loved. My sister had a veggie street taco which I had a bite of and it was surprisingly good. It was beans, peppers, onions, potatoes and avocado. The only negative was the ladies bathroom was in disrepair and a little dirty. However the food and quick service was outstanding. I will definitely be back.",

My most recent experience was the worst, I had simply ordered four tacos and two orders of chips and salsa. Need I say, I called to order for pick up. I arrive and pay for my food, I then wait 30 minutes for such a small order. I see several orders, dine in and take out get there food prior to mine. I ask not only once but three times on the status of my order and how much longer it would take. I got the response \"it's coming up, it's next\" and \"just a few minutes more\" finally I ask one last time and my order was sitting on the counter bagged up with the receipt taped with my name clearly on the tab. The response I got was a little chuckle and a small \"sorry\". No sincere apology whatsoever, really crappy service overall. Really disappointed with the service.",

There carne asada is fresh, well seasoned and flavorful.  Also try their supreme breakfast burrito, it is to die for!  It is high quality and really inexpensive.  It's not a sit down restaurant type of place so you may not want to take a date here.  The drawbacks is the sitting place within the restaurant, you don't have many places to sit and when you order to go, make sure to check your food before you leave.  They have a tendency of missing things in your order or not giving you the things your ordered.",

There was food on the floor that I had to step over to get to a seat.  The burrito though pretty much hit the spot. The meat had a texture I expect from good quality meat and the tortilla was perfect. To improve the experience, I'd like to see salsa bottles at the tables, and I'd want the green salsa to taste a little greener - some extra cilantro in there would be good but also some extra heat. I also prefer whole beans over re-fried beans.",

Family owned, and operated by the \"sisters\" -Watch the Diners Drive ins and Dives Food network show, it ROCKS! Peek through the pick up window and watch everyone feverishly chopping, stewing, and griddle-ing EVERYTHING. Carnitas-Bomb! Carne Asada-Wicked good. Chicken-Superb. Homemade Habanero sauce is on FIRE! So are their other sauces(red or green in your own squirt bottle). Only complaint is layout of the place, when it's busy you'll see. 50%  of the restaurant's seating area are for separate boys/girls restrooms. They need a remodel, but that won't stop me from becoming the Duke here.",

The positives: the food was good, the price was good for the quantity, the salsas were delicious The not so positives: I've had better horchata, the food was not freshly warm when it came out and ended up getting cold by the middle of the meal!  More on the dishes I tried:   The bombero burrito had a special smokey tasting spicy sauce on top, if you're not a fan of smokey flavors, don't get it. The grilled veggie burrito had spicy potatoes inside along with other veggies, maybe it could use less potatoes though...overall pretty tasty! Chicken and cheese enchilladas: the chicken is not a shredded chicken, so it was not the classic taste for an enchilada, but it was still pretty good. The cheese enchilada was solid.  Hard shell chicken taco: again, the chicken is not shredded, it's cut into smaller pieces and is cooked with spices, but the lack of juiciness in the meat leads to a little less enjoyment of the items that have chicken in them. Otherwise, the taco shell was super crispy and delicious.  Fish burrito: made with tilapia that has a nice char to the pieces of tilapia, the burrito was delicious with rice, lettuce, and tomatoes in it too. overall it was a great choice of my fiance's Horchata: as I mentioned above, it was a little on the watered down side, so nothing great. But I still love having some to cool down the spicy, oniony, garlicky flavors that can be in the food!",

    "text": "Just got back from Los Taquitos. Picked up the 3 tacos combo. I got two fish and one shrimp with rice and beans for $6.75 plus tax and I also got a horchata. There are a couple thing I want to address. First off, the horchata was overwhelmingly sweet and grainy and this is because it is sitting in a container with spout on the bottom, so all the sugar and everything settles there and gets poured into the drink. It tasted almost like bubble gum. Easy solution, get a circulating fountain like most mexican restaurants have or even a container and ladle it out so it can be stirred, like I had in Mexico. Ok Food, The tacos I had were really good, I just hate that they are only 3 bites each, I could eat like 10 and I'm a small girl. The street tacos in Mexico are bigger for sure. The shrimp was so tiny, like the smallest salad shrimp and there was 3 on my taco, so that just shows how small they are. The fish is good, but it is chopped up so it looks like chicken and kinda tastes like chicken and doesnt have much flavor on its own. It comes with just lettuce and pico which is fine, I would have preferred cabbage like in Mexico. I was offered one of each sauce. A spicy chipotle and a really spicy green. Both are good, the green a lil better. Rice and beans are good, nothing spectacular. I was a lil disappointed that i didn't get lime and napkins and a fork. I could have easily grabbed it myself but I was in a hurry. I should also mention that the first time I went, my partner did not like the bombero burrito at all because it was drenched in the chipotle sauce, so if yo don't like chipotle I wouldn't recommend it. As for the place itself, it has a good ambience. The counter girl is friendly. The mural on the wall is pretty badass. No table service so expect to wait for a number to be called. Overall it's not a bad spot, probably the only lil mexican taco shop in Tuke. Please take my suggestions about the horchata and putting napkins, silverware and limes in the to go orders and consider upping the size of your tacos, I need more than 3 bites each!",

All was very good but the tamale was dry (?) as it had already been unwrapped and had a chance to dry out before I received my meal.  The counter help was real nice.  The meals are served on black plastic plates.  The plastic utensils are long handled.  They offer Coke products and tea.  They were out of Mr Pibb during my visit.  It was good enough that I will stop back in.  And I would recommend the place to others.",

Following that they did not even meet the minimum bar of getting my order right. It was nowhere close.  I have previously been to Taquitos and had decidely mediocre service but excellent food.  Unfortunately they could not even meet that standard this time.  Spend your money somewhere where it will be appreciated.",

Story goes a little something like started as a food truck got popular. And was even featured by Guy Ferri (white hair dude on food network). I always order a variety of street tacos. Sometimes my friends will ask someone at the counter what they're favorite thing on the menu is. They've always been awesome suggestions. They were extremely satisfied (surprising bc neither of them are huge on Mexican food). I live this place and dine here regularly. As a matter a fact I'll prob go down for lunch today. 1$ taco Tuesday!!!",

He'd never been, despite living on this side of town for years, and now he's hooked too along with his best friend. The seafood burrito is really good. The wait isn't too bad, it's usually just a couple minutes, and the staff is friendly.  Funny story - I was talking about some Mexican restaurants with my dad, and he mentioned a place he loves \"near Tempe\" that has the best tacos he's had, and I mentioned my favorite is Los Taquitos, and he exclaimed, \"That's it!\"",

We ordered two prickly pear cocktails and they arrived when we were almost done with our food. Apparently they make them scratch to order and only one person can make it.

It was busy, but nothing out of the ordinary. There were plenty of tables open. This is a walk-up and order so it boggles my mind how they weren't prepared.   So, poor experience there and then I just checked my credit card statement and they charged me twice for 2 different amounts, totaling $50. Our total order was $22. Not only did I waste a ton of time waiting for my food, but now I have to call them back to fix this. Maybe it was a one-off, but I can't give them the benefit of doubt with 2 big screw-ups.",

I came her a few years ago, and they have expanded the size of the place significantly, which is a nice change because they used to be pretty cramped, but not anymore! I ordered the nachos for the first time, and wow was it a lot of food. As for the flavor, they are great and highly recomended! They use fresh xhips and layer the ingredients which is a very nice touch. I chose the Asada and Pastor as the meat for them, and it was a nice xombination. Their asada is very smooth and tender, while their Pastor is slightly sweet. All very tasty. I have also had several other menu items and never been dissapointed. Their tacos are my personal fave because they are just the right size and you can order a three-pack of tacos, each being a different kind. In all, I would highly recomend this place and will definitely be back......many many many many more times!",

The food tries to be authentic-ish but doesn't quite reach it. I'll say this- their breakfast burritos are bomb. Hot and fresh hits the spot. However when I came to try their bowls (they looked delicious) I wasn't as blown away. The rice was really soggy- like mushy soggy and it just wasn't that flavorful taste-wise. My friend got chicken tacos and she said they were dry. I'm torn- I want to come back for the breakfast burritos but I think I'll skip the other stuff for now.  A couple of pros- their chips were good and they have beer and margaritas there.",

Their happy hour started at 4 pm so we ordered a beer and a house margarita. The margarita was strong and very tasty.   Apparently they have a good taco tuesday, I think $1 tacos or something.  Definitely coming back to check it out.",

The problem with this is that I can't eat onions or cilantro... at all... I hate them.  So, I went with tostadas.  I had 1 chicken and 1 carne asada.  I enjoyed both very much!  The tostadas are very simple; layered bottom to top are: tostada shell, beans, meat, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes.  Both the chicken and carne asada were very flavorful, and while the beans were a bit watery, they tasted really good as well.  The place is tiny and crowded, but the service is very friendly and I think the quality of the food makes up for the downfalls.  This is probably my favorite Triple D place so far.",

Service was nice and the people were nice, but the food was a bit...\"eh.\"  Nothing to write home about. Prices were nice and cheap.  I'll shell out a few more bucks and hit Rosa's. It's more flavorful. While LT has a decent kick, the flavor is a bit ho hum.  The tortillas were nice and fresh...that was the best part of the meal. I had ordered the carne asada burrito. It wasn't spiced as much as I thought it would be. Maybe they were hoping the sauce that was in it would make up for the bland spicing.  The sauce had a small bit of kick and was all right. The carnitas tacos were a bit of a let down...the meat was dry, but the salsa was all right.  If you're looking for fast and easy, this is it. If you want food brought to you and you can relax, I'd suggest going to a sit down restaurant.  This had too much of a fast food feel for my taste.",

Most of their food is fairly customizable in terms of spicy-ness, which I find awesome.  My poor tummy can't handle spicy anymore, and that's made finding good Mexican food that I can actually eat a bit difficult down here.  Any requests to alter food (no/little salsa, no cheese, etc) have always been happily accomodated.    Their burritos, while not the biggest I've seen (that title goes to either Picante in Berkeley, CA or High Tech Burrito, also in the Bay Area), they're pretty damned tasty.    All of the meats I've had are very good.  Granted, I've not tried the ground beef, but I tend to steer away from that unless I'm having a burger.

This Family owned Mexican Restaurant has been serving some of the best Mexican food in Phoenix since 1981. Run by five sisters and one brother, they have passed down recipes from their families generations, and serve them up with large portions. Unlike the standard Sonaran style restaurants in the Phoenix area, they have brought flavors from Mexico that will thrill your taste buds. Not too hot but flavorful extraordinaire.  If your in the south east side of Phoenix, you have to try this place, be ready for the wait though, I had a 25 min wait for food, but it is 100% worth it...

I wish I had the chance to try one of their margs but alas, I had work to get done at my job. I got the AZ Style burrito meal and also a chicken taco. The chicken taco was free because I checked in on Foursquare. Love Foursquare deals. The tortilla was amazing, super soft and chewy and not hard/stale or thin/transparent. The potatoes were thick cube cut and the pollo was seasoned with something not too spicy. I should have asked for it without onions, they were tiny but I'm not a fan in general. They have an array of salsas to choose from, but the bottles weren't labeled so I was a little hesitant on what I was getting myself into so I stayed clear.  It is certainly a hole in the wall but the food is just fabulous!",

Like I said, I've been there quite a bit lateley and I've gotten the same girl at the counter on every occasion but once....and she is unfriendly to say the least. I've tried to be overly nice to her, say the order real slow, and repeat...and I barely get a smile from her and she has messed up my order twice (this is out of 6 times, so not a good average). She makes me feel like she's doing me a favor by allowing me to eat there...and it's made my wife not want to go back - the only problem...  ...I can't stay away! In the sea of chain restarants in Ahwatukee and East Valley, its a nice discovery.   So in short. Food good. Al Pastor burrito and tacos and tortas are killer. Green hot sauce in money.

I had the grilled shrimp street tacos.  I was surprised that they do not have cabbage on hand, but other than that the taco's were flavorful and good.  We have a place here in So Cal called Chronic Taco that does them better, but I would still order again.  My son and spouse had carne asada street taco's and they both enjoyed.  Again, tho, they were both able to say that other places we go to are better, but that they were still good.  My spouse also had a carne asada burrito which he enjoyed. Overall, not a beautiful place, but we usually find that to be the case with really good Mexican food.  Go where the food is good, not the decor.  We also went to Roberto's while in Phoenix and we would choose Los Taquito's to go back to again.  Prices were pretty consistent with what we would pay at other places.",

It was an exit away from the Arizona Grand Resort where we were staying.

The taquitos were ok, nothing spectacular and it came with a side of beans and rice which were luke warm and not the satisfying warm/hot home cooked beans and rice.  The chile relleno were definitely very good and should probably be the more \"popular\" item. The filling was nice and cheesy with potato and the sauce had a lot of flavor. Worth ordering!  Not sure what the hype is about but I did like the restaurant wall artwork.",

You can choose the type of meat you want in them. You can even get all three in the combo different. The Torta is awesome and the burritos are mouth watering. Service is great. It gets a little cramped waiting for your order because the place is really that small. The prices are good too. Sure there isn't a dollar menu but who needs one when the food is this good. Dollar menus are for places with horrible food. It can get packed around lunch time so be warned. Calling you order in will save on time if you only have an hour for lunch.

I grew up on some good stuff, so I know when rice is made good or too overlooked/undercooked. This place does it good   The decor in here is super cute, love the big Mexican skeleton drawing.

Not that this has anything to do with the food, but the woman who is always up at the register looks like she rolled out of bed and didn't shower. Her bra straps are always showing and it looks really unprofessional. It's kind of gross actually.

For starters, the place is easy to miss. It's a hole in the wall. It's very small inside, only a few tables; definitely consider takeout.     That said, if it's not busy, don't be afraid to stay. We ate in; when there was a significant lull in the crowd, the girl behind the counter came both to clear our tables and to deliver a second item I ordered a bit later in the evening. I wish I'd been carrying cash, there is a tip jar by the register, and I would have loved to have left something for that.     The food...ah, the food. Great bang for the buck. Have I had better tacos? Yes. Once, handmade by a Mexican immigrant my mother was good friends with, as we joined her for a family dinner. In restaurants? No. This is good Mexican street food, small hand made corn tortillas with flavorful, moist meat on them, and some warm salsa on top. Lovely. They even offer lengua, for those that like it, a very nice touch.     As others have said, the rice is very good; I wasn't actually that fond of the beans though.     Is this place worth going 20 minutes out of your way? Unfortunately, no, hence the 4 star. But is it worth going to if you're already nearby? Yes, very much yes.",

We went at 3:00 P.M. and I was expecting more people to be there. It was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives so I wanted to go. I got a carneasada burrito with no beans. It's not that beans make me gassy, I just don't like them. At the first few bites, it was flavorless. I could barely taste the cheese, the meat was dry, plus the burrito wrap (bread) was the most flavorful thing in the burrito believe it or not. The burrito got better on each bite, but it wasn't the best Mexican meal I've ever had. I enjoyed my burrito. You know that cliche saying \"The first bite's always the best.\" It was the other way around with the burrito. The other people that were with me were happy, except for one. She had a  shrimp taco, a fish taco, carnitas burrito and she said it was a little bland. The other person with me is the only one out of us 3 who really enjoyed his meal beginning to end but, he also gave it 3 stars. The place is a little dirty. There was a piece of tomato    on the seat at the booth we sat at. The service was friendly. What confused me was that on the menu, it said that they have Mr. Pibb but, on the soda machine it said Dr. Pepper so that confused me. We drove home with a full belly and an o.k. meal.",

Walked in and the women at the cash register was quick to help me with the menu being I never been there. I asked what's the most popular and she said ..everything. .but if you like spicy. .then you can try the bombero burrito. So I ordered the bombero burrito with Carne asada. The Carne Asada melts in your mouth and the diced raw jalapenos in the burrito was a nice touch too. Beans and rice were great. However,  wasn't a big fan of the sauce on top..spicy I liked,  but not the sweetness.  Oh and the women at the register helping me; was as Hot as the burrito! Gorgeous!!!",

    "text": "I dropped in here 3-4 years ago and had some nice tacos.  Although good, I guess they weren't spectacular enough to bring me back.  I got takeout for 6 people Sunday (this place open later than the superior Burrito Co.).  This was not a good experience, but I perhaps will give them another try some day.  I arrived at the restaurant estimated ready time stated during our phone order.  They are busy.  There was just a single funnel line and I had to stand at the end behind numerous people placing their orders, rather than walk up for the phone order I expected to be ready.  Over 10 minutes later I got to the front -- order not ready and I hear a shout to the kitchen to get the phone order ready.  I pay and wait.  At least another 10 minutes pass and I am motioned back to the counter.  Looking at my notes, I see a couple of identical burrito orders and I have the foresight to ask if there are two of those in the bags.  The woman checks -- there is one.  She shouts back to the kitchen to get another one ready and apologizes.  I resume waiting.  When she calls me back she says all is ready and she threw in something else for my wait.  My destination is 5 minutes from this location.  I drive back to my wating guests.  When the food is all laid out, there is an order of 3 tacos (mine) also missing.  The beans are all cold.  I also had ordered a chile relleno with beans only.  It is good, but not enough, and it's got rice.    I'm sure everyone has had their takeout order messed up.  That's 3 strikes on the same order, though.  Since I didn't get any tacos this time, which is what seems to be the signature item here, I can't comment on those, but the chile relleno, cold beans, and taste I got of a burrito, were merely good.  Maybe I'll drop in again within the next 3 years.",

I like their carne asada and the way they season it, I like their beans, pretty wonderful and light, I like their salsa though it has a little too much cilantro for me, and the chorizo is pretty dynamite. The problem is that aside from the carne asada being a little more consistently good, I don't think it's any better than Filibertos. And Filibertos has the advantage of drive-thrus, quick service and basically no waiting in line. I would never discourage anyone from eating here, I totally support Los Taquitos and will eat here a bunch more times without question, I just think it's a little hyped up. Stop by if you're in the area, but don't make it a trek just because it was on TV.",

Make sure you get the marinated pork tacos. They are selicious  (seriously delicious). All the meat is cooked amazingly so I can't imagine anything being disappointing.

The girl at the counter was pointing fingers at the kitchen and acting like she had no clue what was going on. We told her we changed our mind about eating there, and then left.

I get food from here at least once a week, the quesadillas, tacos, burritos and bowls are all amazing and decently prices. always get the meal/plate, they add in beans and rice for only a couple bucks extra. they also have fresh horchata which might be my favorite part! the service is always quick and they have never messed up an order for me. if you're looking for great Mexican food, you need to go to Los Taquitos!",

    "text": "Top-notch Mexican food from an unassuming storefront in an otherwise generic shopping center.  I was turned on to Los Taquitos by a friend who, despite certain dietary restrictions, will indulge in the tacos here when she needs her street food fix.  Coming from California, I have been mystified and befuddled by the lack of good, cheap Mom-and-Pop Mexican food joints in the Phoenix Metro Area.  It seems that when I have gone out exploring, I have been completely disappointed with bland, underseasoned, cafteria-style Mexican food that seems to be de rigeur in these parts.  This is not the case with Los Taquitos.  The food here is a tremendous value.  You spend no more than you would at any other Mexican food hole-in-the-wall, but the flavor and attention to texture and food preparation is exceptional.  The hard-shell tacos have the proper jaw-rattling crunch, and the meat is well-seasoned and tasty.  They don't require too much hot sauce because they are so savory on their own, but the house-made green and red sauce condiments, add the perfect amount of heat and brightness.  I have also sampled the carne asada burrito, served enchilada-style (i.e., smothered in red simmer sauce), and found it to be spot-on as far as texture and taste.  The flour tortilla is soft and sturdy, whereas the beef is toothsome and appropriately salty and spicy.  I fear that I have been ruined for all other quick-and-dirty Mexican food joints after eating here.  Los Taquitos sets the bar very high for this niche of restaurant, and the service is prompt despite the crowds of loyal patrons that jam-pack themselves into this small little place for a taste of spicy, savory, satisfying Mexican food heaven.",

I also shared an order of chips and guacamole and have to point out that their avocado is fantastic - very clean and \"refreshing\" tasting, something that is often promised but not delivered in guacamole.  I'm only subtracting one point as the restaurant was a bit disorganized. They do a pretty good takeout business here, and while I was planning on dining in, the majority of the tables were occupied by guests waiting for their food (and not eating). This isn't the restaurant's fault necessarily, but worth being aware of if you are planning on dining in.",

The she says actually it'll $.50 is that okay?  So I said well, yes I guess as long as it's a nice sized side of sauce (the enchilada is only $1.80!) and she says \"no, it will be in a 2 oz. container... the same container that they give away with their hot sauces.   Who does that?  .50 for a side of red sauce that is free at Taco Bell. Great customer service there Los Taquitos, well done, NOT!!!!!",

    "text": "I wanted to try something new, and didn't want to see my high-school sweetheart on the other corner. Now I'm coming back to review LT, and I see \"update review\". Wait, have I met this one before? Definitely a lot has changed since then and I didn't even recognize it.  The breakfast burrito with carne asada was piping hot, the cheese was properly melted and the potatoes stayed warm down to the last bite. I'd say solid work on everything everything except the carne asada. A few too many pieces of meat were either too chewy or too fatty. Both salsas were fantastic. Red: smoky, balanced chipotle peppers, plenty of heat; Green: much more subtle in heat and flavor, but still worth putting a few splashes of it on parts of your burrito. I only wish they kept the salsas on ice, but having individual bottles to take to your table is also nice. At $4-4.50 for just eggs+potatoes and $6.50ish for eggs+steak, I think the portion size is just a hair too small. Don't get me wrong, it tastes fantastic and it was definitely filling, but other places don't mess around with portions.   I'd say its a solid 4/5. I haven't had as much Tex Mex due to living in NE, so I might be overinflating, but I also think the carne asada could use some work. It all balances.",

Sometimes beans can make the shell soggy, and I want it perfectly crispy. On the inside you have the chicken, rice, cheese, and lettuce. They also give you sides of sour cream and guac.

Now I was there for lunch time so as much as I wanted to plop right down at the bar, that's apparently not socially acceptable. I got a carne asada burrito and a couple tacos.   The tacos were pretty great. Full of meat with onions, cilantro and salsa like they should be. The al pastor was particularly flavorful. The burrito itself was very good, the meat was tender and delicious.   The rice however was bad. It was old and crunchy. Fairly disappointing.  Be warned, even small amounts of people tend to jam up the flow of the restaurant. When I was there there was a single cashier who not only took order but also received them from the window. Be aware if you want to go at peak hours.",

    "text": "I used to love coming here for a bean burrito. Years later, I come here for tacos: El pastor - seasoned with only hot heat yet the meat is dry like a Sahara desert and lacking any actual flavor to entice my taste buds. Carne asada - absolutely no seasonings recognizable other than salt, and yet again very DRY meat. I'm already sad and dissapointed. Corn tortilla shell is dry as well and soggy/rubbery - reminds me of the Mission tortillas you can purchase at Fry's or Basha's or Albertson's or Safeway. No good toppings to make up for this mishap. If I had a lime wedge I'd have drenched the shit outta these tacos to offset the dry and saltiness. Paired it with rice and beans which were overall salty and disappointing. SMH. How do us Arizonans pass this as 5 stars??? Seriously? Have you no standards anymore?? Food came out within minutes, and it was during lunch, so I expected the meat to be NOT dry..... and to think Guy Fieri passed this place off years ago.",

They appeared in a watery sauce with zero flavor, The cheese taste was not discernable, there was almost no cheese surrounded by a light pink tortilla. Easily the worst cheese enchilada ever for me.     The beef enchilada was worse. Almost no meat, certainly not the typical ground picadillo you expect in a beef enchilada. The tortilla was like rubber, it could not be cut with a fork.      The chicken taco (Street) was a tiny piece of corn tortilla covered wth rabbit turd size pieces of overdone chicken.    The chicken bowl was full of rice and black beans, chicken pieces, pico de gallo, cheese, and cilantro and for $8 was a decent meal.    There were not enough seats for everybody so lots of patrons had to stand. It took 20 minutes to pick up our order.    The curse of DDD is alive and well in Phoenix.",

They used to be more of a dive restaurant, but have since cleaned up and expanded to make it an attractive restaurant.   Everything on their menu is incredible. I don't think I've ever been disappointed. My personal favorites are the carne asada tacos or burritos. I have yet to find another place that makes asada as tasty as Los Taquitos. Their chicken burrito enchilada style is also excellent.   About the only negative thing I can think of -- recently their asada burritos have been way overdone on the spicy side to the point where it's overpowering. Hopefully this was a fluke, because their burritos have been perfection for the past decade.",

The Carne asada was by far the best meat. Tender and flavorful..I still think about it. The pastor was decent and spiced well.. I still prefer a bit of a crisp to them. The chicken was my least favorite. It wasn't bad but it just tasted like chopped white meat chicken. But oh my, the refried beans were probably the best I have had.

Taco Tuesday provides $1 street tacos on 4 different varieties (Pastor, carnitas, chicken, and marinated chicken when I was there).",

Most of the time you don't bother to go back because by the time you get home everything is cold or soggy. You call and complain and they say they're sorry and they don't offer you a thing. They do allow you to come back and get the missing piece but even then with gas prices you can cost you 30 or 40% of that item plus your food is ruined. They don't offer you a voucher for the next time you're in route going to give you a discount on your meals nothing just I'm sorry and that supposed to be good enough. They need to suffer some consequences or they won't get better. This is been happening a long time.  But when everything is right the food is very good. I love the tortas.",

You order at the counter and sit down until they call your number.   Although it may not be impressive in appearance or from the outside, the food is absolutely amazing. Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had.  I had their signature Bombero burrito. It had carne asada, beans, and veggies, with a nice hot sauce on the outside. The carne asada was so lean and melted in my mouth. It was extremely spicy, which I love. The tortillas are homemade, and you can certainly taste the quality they put into their product. I also had homemade chips and their excellent salad with my burrito. And it's also served with some of the best refried beans north of the border.  Guy Fieri definitely nailed it by featuring this place on his show!!!",

It's got a totally different vibe since the remodel and I love it!Food still has the authentic homemade taste you just couldn't call it a dive anymore. The service staff is always friendly and helpful. They did keep the original yellow benches but when they expanded they added quite a few tables in between. One wall now has flat screen tvs, new lighting and modern music. Food wise I like the AL pastor the best then the Carne asada or chicken. Depending on how hungry I am either getting tacos or burritos. It's rare I dont leave here without getting a horchata. It's fun to munch on the pickled veggies while waiting and both homemade salsa have unique flavors. I get my burritos with the spicy bombero sauce but it's not for everybody.... (at least be able to do Chipotle hot salsa if you gonna try this)",

I ordered one burrito to go and sat down. During the course of my 35 minute wait, yes 35 minutes, I overhear complaint after complaint, people getting the wrong order. One guy had waited 50 minutes for 4 burritos and had still not gotten them. The couple in front of me hadn't gotten their food. When i finally asked about my food, another woman came up asking for her money back because they had been there an hour. There were 3 girls working the counter and none of them knew what the hell was going on and there excuse was that \"they had a received a large order and were backed up\". Not my problem or any other patrons problem. Serve the customers who are in your restaurant or you may not have any come back. I love the food but the service would definitely make me not come back.  Long story short, i waited 35 minutes for my food, got home, and it was the wrong burrito. Threw it in the trash because i don't like sour cream. Highly disappointed. Probably won't go back.",

Both of those items are good (if you want \"authentic\" then you'll need to buy a plane ticket).  The tacos are also tasty, and I appreciate that they make their own red and green salsa.  What I can't quite understand is why they serve the esoteric lengua meat, but don't serve the more common chorizo meat.  (Perhaps it's because of the raunchy \"chorizo\" that passes for food north of the border?)  At any rate, my three stars are because of the high price (the \"Guy Fieri tax\"), the forgettable side dishes (an afterthought), and the long wait time (read every other Yelp review).",

I ordered 3 hard chicken tacos and a chile relleno - food was definitely solid. The chile was very large, and actually a chile, not a poblano.  It was crowded but our group of 9 had no problem getting a few tables together as previous diners left.",

I was really curious about their carnitas that they cook with sweetened condensed milk (or maybe it's evaporated) and I was surprised how tender and flavorful they were.   The carne asada was super good. I don't know what it was marinated in, but it seemed to have way more flavor than I am used to in carne asada, and I mean that in a good way. I loved it. I loved it more than the carnitas that I was looking forward to!   Their horchata is also really good. Rich and creamy with visible spices. Definitely not the typical fountain drink style horchata.   I would go back in a heartbeat and look forward to returning to Phoenix to do so =)",

I had the meal with rice and beans which was good to soak up all that heavenly sauce.  I will definitely be going there again.",

    "text": "I'm from California where there is a Mexican food joint on every corner and when I first moved to Phoenix a year ago I've been on the hunt for a legit Mexican food place, not a Filiberto's or Macaios :P. Living in Ahwatukee, the only legit places I was able to find up until a month ago was in central/downtown Phoenix (Rosito's and La Canasta). As much as I love those two places, the drive sucks! After all this is Phoenix, there has to be a good place right by me!  Finally, I was advised to go to Los Taquitos from a friend of mine saying they have BOMB carne asada so I had to go see for myself as Elliot Rd is down the street from me (YES!). When I entered this place, it felt like home as it reminded me of one of my favorite places I used to go to back in Cali. It's clean, the staff is very friendly and their salsa is awesome! I personally like the green over the the red but they're both good! You can choose a la carte or a meal plate and they have a breakfast menu to boot! Now was the carne asada BOMB? YES! The carne asada was to die for, it was juicy and cooked just right. The tacos are small-ish but hit the right spot without putting you in a food coma afterwards. I usually have 2 or 3 (if im starving) and I'm in heaven. I go here about once a week for the tacos and I am never dissapointed. The burritos are excellent as well and are medium in size, again they don't serve the super XXXL burritos here which is fine with me because I don't like the food baby feeling I get after eating one of those bad boys! Oh and I forgot to add that the tacos are CHEAP, $1.15 a piece. If you want a 3 tacos plate, its 6 bucks, comes with rice and beans. So for the south phoenix/ahwatukee/chandler peeps, I recommend this place, its delicious, cheap, and clean as well!",

This place is rather small which makes it perfect if you're there with some friends or a special someone! My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself.

I had carnitas tacos and the carnitas was probably the best I have ever had! The red salsa complemented the tacos without taking away from the flavor of the meat! I also had a cheese enchilada and the enchilada was just as good as the tacos...very authentic!!!!

The kids had two $1.15 taco's each which was the right amount for them (if you're an adult, I would probably get 4). The place is tiny, not the best setup, but the line moved fairly quickly.  I'll certainly be back, it ranks up there with Carolina's as one of my ATF for Mexican in the valley.",

When we arrived, we were underwhelmed by the boxy feel of the interior -- the restaurant is essentially a box with tables around the perimeter and down the middle -- but the place was clean and everything smelled great.  What we DID appreciate was our food.  Really nice flavors, very filling, and fresh.  My husband got a veggie burrito and it was huge.  I ordered the veggie bowl and really liked the hashbrown-style potatoes (and the beans...and rice... and veggies...and sauce...).

This place was kind of dry and not a great selection of salsa. Typical Mexican fare , little pricey for average quality, but I'd rather go to Polibertos on Baseline and hardy in Tempe. The biggest disappointment was the music selection. IT WAS TERRIBLE AND NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY MUSIC. I was annoyed because I was there with my wife, 11yr and 3yr old daughters, and the music was TOO promiscuous for my taste. Better suited for clubbers. Not family friendly environment when music is blaring about sexual content. AND YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR TORTILLA CHIPS AND SALSA. POLIBERTOS IS FREE SALSA AND TORTILLA CHIPS. MANY OTHER PLACES THAT ARE BETTER, NOT WORTH THE EXTRA DRIVE.",

    "text": "While visiting Phoenix, I couldn't wait to get my hands on some tasty authentic Mexican food.  (I lived in the southwest for almost 10 years and miss the Mexican food the most.)  So since I didn't know where to go, I relied on Yelp reviews and also I saw that Guy Fieri visited this place, so though it was worth a try.   The food was good and the prices were decent for what you got, but in the end I walked away wishing my only chance to get great Mexican had been some place better.  We started off with chips and salsa.  The chips seemed like they were homemade, they were crunchy and warm.  The salsa was great. I could've eaten more than the little cup they provided.  Also I am not used to having to pay for salsa and chips at Mexican restaurants so that was a little off putting. But for $2.50...salsa was good.  We then had a couple of margaritas (regular and prickly pear).  I am not a fan of regular margarita's so I thought that one was okay.  But mine was delicious.  Prickly Pear was another thing you don't see much of on the East Coast, so delighted to have it.  And it tasted great, would have ordered more if I wasn't driving.  For dinner I ordered the Burrito Bombero and my boyfriend ordered the 3 chicken enchiladas.  The burrito was good, and if you like spice, and I mean a lot of spice, then you might love it.  I am a spicy food fanatic, but this was just a bit too much.  I felt like I couldn't enjoy any of the other tastes of the burrito because my mouth was burning too much.  I think if they took the spice down just a tad, it would have been a lot better.  My boyfriend thought his enchiladas were a bit salty.  Not very impressed.  I thought they were just okay as well.  I have definitely had better.  We probably should have gone with the (street) tacos since that seems to be where all the great reviews come from.  If I lived in Phoenix I would give it another chance. However since I don't when I am back I will have to find another place in search of the authentic Mexican food that I miss so much.",

This is not where most people would go for authentic Mexican food.  Los Taquitos is just about perfect for what it is.  The food is delicious and the prices are on par with Filibertos, without tasting like Filibertos.  It makes complete sense Food Network featured this restaurant once you take a bite.  Cons: It's in a strip mall between a Safeway and haircut place and a Walgreens and dive bar (Cactus Jacks), service is rushed, and condiments and hot sauce are available only if the restaurant isn't packed (usually isn't) and they're at the stand up front.  Pros: Everything that matters.  Food is authentic and tasty, you can come here anytime for a hangover \"breakfast\" or lunch or dinner, and you can expect that whatever you order off the menu will come exactly as you'd hope (or better).   Highly recommended.",

Lady responds with a sour face and hard tone \"good, how are you?\" I would think that with business being as good as it is and their stellar reputation that this is absolutely unacceptable!

We are open for anything.   I checked out this place on Yelp for reviews and all of them were great.   I was looking forward to finding a \"gem\" of a Mexican restaurant.  We all agreed that the dishes were mediocre.  It wasn't the cleanest place either.  I ordered my usual chicken enchilladas  with green sauce.  Very tasty and a little different.  They marinate the chicken, pork, and beef which makes the chicken, pork and beef a little bit mushy.  The rice was tasty though.  My other half ordered the chille relleno which was also a little bit different from what we are used to.  It was served in a brown sauce with cheese, onions, and diced potatoes.  Pretty tasty. He also had a lengua (tongue) taco. Small but also very tasty. There is no waiter service.  You go up to the counter and order.  I'm not crazy about the plastic plates, but no tipping is a good plus.  We went for lunch about 2.00PM and the place was crowded.  So obviously lots of people enjoy this place.  The menu was plentiful with lots of choices.   I understand the place was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins-and Dives.  I guess you could label this place in the Dive category.  Prices were quite reasonable.  All and all, if you like Mexican Street food, Los Taquitos might fit the bill. I'm not sure if we will return or not.  We will still try other places to finally find Mexican Food Heaven.  Even if nothing is perfect, the journey to get to it is the best part.",

After seeing it on the Food Network my expectations were a little high.  First of all, the camera angles made me think the restaurant was big when it was about the size of a Subway restaurant.  We almost had to leave because there were no seats available.  There were about 8 of us and we did not want to have to take our food to go.  Fortunately, two tables ended up leaving and we were able to sit down.    I got the three taco meal. I guess I should have realized that \"hot sauce\" meant hot but I was just thinking \"oh it'll be a little spicy\" NO! I took maybe two bites and couldn't finish.  I had to trade food with my niece, I ate her quesadillas which were pretty good and she didn't seem to be phased by the hot tacos.  I definitely was not satisfied when I left, I basically ate off of everyone else's plates.  If I ever return to Phoenix, I probably won't be back here.  There are several restaurants in Atlanta that are Food Network worthy, in my opinion this was not.  The customer service was very good, the ladies were very nice and excited that we mentioned the food network.",

    "text": "(Edited 12/6/2012 to 5 stars from 4, because I have to compare how good these guys are to the 2 years of Mexican food shenaniganery that we have been subjected to in, of all places, L.A. Alright, back to the original review.)  Being from San Diego as well, taco shops are hard to like in Phoenix.  This one isn't.  We went there because of Guy Fieri.  But the carnitas is why we go back...4 times since November.  And we live in Queen Creek.    It's a taco shop.  Taco shop = street food, not fast food.  Street tacos are small.  Thankfully, so is the price.  $1.25 each.  That means I walk out full with authentic Mexican food cravings satiated for $5.    My wife's favorite - carne asada and carnitas tacos.  While the carne asada is good to great, the carnitas is excellent.  Both have the typical onion/cilantro accouterments with red hot sauce added..  The carne asada has tasty guacamole added also.  I'd prefer they leave the sauce off and give me the option.  They have a green sauce also.  Both are delicious.    The carnitas burrito is what I want, though.  First time I ordered it I asked for no beans (a burrito with beans is a strike against them) and got a flour tortilla packed with melty, juicy, glorious carnitas meat.  If you're looking for pure, concentrated, braised pork flavor get the burrito sans beans.    Other notables:  the chili relleno, the sopa (topped with any meat you'd like.  We, of course, tried the carnitas).  I waffled between 4 and 5 stars because of the aforementioned bean faux pas, and their signature burrito, the Bombero, just didn't cut it for us( consider this a 4.5 star review?).  The sauce was a hybrid between enchilada and american barbecue sauce.  Weird.  But the insides were still great.  Try them.",

    "text": "What I was thinking on the way to los taquitos:  \"I hate that Guy Fieri.  What a jerk.  First of all, he pronounces his last name all Italian, and I am 100% certain that he pronounced it like a full on american all his life until he made it on Food Network.  Then, he gets to drive around and taste greasy food all day.  Plus, he looks high as a kite sometimes on air, which probably makes the food even better.  Anywhere from 1-4 reasons to be jealous/annoyed with the guy, depending on who you are.\"  Also: \"I wish God would smite Beyonce.  Her songs are the most annoying songs I've ever heard.  If there were a way for her to get smacked into permanent silence, I'd be all for it.\"  And: \"I can't wait to eat at this place.  Street tacos sound delish.  Where is it?  Wait--this looks like a residential neighborhood.  Where the hell am I?\"  Ultimately I find the place and go in.  There's some floozy outside with a huge rack--only pertinent because she ended up being an employee.  Well I guess it isn't really pertinent then, either.  Anyway, I'm *wanting* to like this place.  I long to be able to say that I went to a place today and ate food that tasted like pureed happiness.  I want to give this place five stars and brag right and left that this is the place to be.  But I don't.  The service was good--the girl was nice (bc of an earlier review I was expecting the worst) and she told me the street tacos were the way to go.  I got the three tacos, one chicken, one carnitas, one steak (asada).  Plus rice and beans.  On corn tortillas.  And I got a sexy-looking bottle of coke.  When the food came out, I was devastated.  Where my three tacos should have been, I had three walniut-sized excuses for tacos.  Where my beans covered in mexican cheese should have been, I got beans covered in an afterthought of some white cheese (which isn't what I wanted.  Sue me).  Where my rice should have been there was rice.  1 for 3.  The street tacos all tasted ostensibly the same.  That punk Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on Food Network made it sound like I'd wet myself with glee upon eating the carnitas, and the lady making the batch acted like they'd be good enough to keep part of the recipe a secret.  They aren't.  That recipe should be open source for sure, so that maybe someone can come along and improve it.  I certainly could.  Anyway--maybe it was because he was high as a f*&^ing kite but the food did not taste like magic, it tasted like hot sauce.  And I am all for hot sauce--I'll bitchslap a habanero or two, no problem.  But the issue is that whatever I ate, it tasted like only the hot sauce.  I added green sauce--still the same flavor.  I wanted to be wowed, but instead I thought, \"Meh.  I've experienced better.\"  Which is why you see two stars here.  In fact, I don't blame Los Taquitos for doing what they do.  Whatever is fine by me.  But now I kinda wanna slew-foot Guy Fieri just that little bit more for telling me that this place was so good.  If you're gonna tell the world what's delicious, don't smoke out first, because I've been there and eaten a piece of my cat's litter and it tasted pretty decent to me at the time.  Hardly a reliable indicator of a culinary masterpiece.  A couple of disclaimers: I don't hate Guy, I have no idea if he smokes out, I'm not judging him or you, stoner.  But I am judging that very average set of tacos.",

Not everything is amazing, but their best items can't be beat.  In my opinion, here are their items, in order of awesomeness:  1) Marinated Pork Burrito 1a) Shrimp Taco (Fish is great too) 2) Bombero Burrito  (very spicy, so watch out)  After those, it's all about personal taste.  Great place, high recommended.",
