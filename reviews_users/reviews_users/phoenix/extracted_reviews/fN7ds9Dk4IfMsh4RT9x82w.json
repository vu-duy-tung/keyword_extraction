So with this place I will say this... the location is great, the way that they remodeled the place is spot on (not too trendy but not cheap looking), the staff was very friendly, but the food just didn't do it for me.  With what my guest and I had, the tastes were either too bland, too over powering, or just not quite right.  Don't know if it is because I grew up around traditional Japanese food or that I have become too accustomed to scottsdale Asian cuisine, this place just didn't do it for me.  The Kirin Light was good though :)",

When we walked in and it looked rather dead but the hostess told us there was no tables available Beyond a 45-minute wait for food if we sat at the empty bar. So we decided to take our chances sitting at the empty bar. My food came out first my friends food came out 15 minutes later. Only half of my order came out when I checked after it after being given no information 15 minutes later I was told that the kitchen was backed up even though there was only two other tables in there besides us and 20 minutes later my food came out. We ask to speak to the manager who started screaming at my friend. I would have to say in my 37 years this is my worst restaurant experience ever and if I could give negative Stars I would give this restaurant a -10 Stars and the food was bad as well as the service. If you have a chance do not ever go to wok-n-roll and please tell all your friends to not ever go as well.",

We were seated by a staff member at the sushi bar and waited 7 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. Then a few more minutes for them to offer us menus, and then it took 10 more minutes to get water. The wings were okay, but very chewy and tough. They said there was fresh blue fin in but the nigiri did not taste fresh, had very strong odor. If the overall experience had been better I might consider going back, but I just don't have any desire to and wouldn't recommend.",

I have to honestly say, especially after living in LA after 12 years being near somenof the most authentic Asian food in America, the Chow Mein at Wok n Roll is HANDS DOWN THE BEST CHOW MEIN I've ever had. Better than Chinatown in Los Angeles. Yep, I crossed that line and I challenge anyone to put another restaurants chow mein against Wok n Roll. If you're in the mood for noodles, you need to come to this place ASAP. I had the chicken. Perfectly tender meat, vegetables still slightly crunchy, noodles soft but not over cooked, and the sauce right on the money. I will DEFINITELY be back.",

Look how often I review, hardly ever. So this place must be pretty bad to encourage me to log in and actually give a review.   The sushi is 1 very small grade above grocery store sushi that sits out all day in plastic.   Worse wasabi I've ever had. How can they screw up wasabi?  I live across the street. I was wanting to like this place.  Why I didn't just go to sushi J (next door which is great) is a mistake I regret.   Just don't.  (Now an Update to my review a week later because the owner responded to me) wow. The owner is delusional. I'm no way associated to a better restaurant nearby. Yet he accuses me of smoking with people from a nearby restaurant. I don't smoke, and I haven't been to sushi J in months. Look at his review, how off is he???   But hey yelpers. Go visit this place and make up your own mind in a mediocre subpar restaurant that is using high yelp reviews from a previous restaurant to up his credibility.",

He forgot to put in our sushi roll orders and when we asked about them half an hour later, he kinda laughed and was like \"oops I knew I forgot something.\" The manager did come over to apologize but his table side manner was more tweeker than professional...constantly messing with his clothes, chewing on his tongue, no eye contact. He said that he would comp half of the food and rush our dinner. The rolls arrive but we're somewhat lackluster. When we had to ask the server for the check rather than having it delivered...less than 20% was comped. Had the manager said he was only going to comp 20% that would have been fine, however, he said that he would comp half and after spending 10 years in the restaurant industry myself, it's the principle of the matter. The issue was resolved eventually but over all the experience left a lot to be desired. Pity since we'd heard good things about the place and had high hopes.",

    "text": "Whoever wrote that there is a Saturday \"happy hour\" is wrong. There is also no liquor license as of 5/28. Nevertheless, the fish was fresh-but not spectacular-though the roll combos were very interesting and good. We tried three. The food is good- it isn't \"OMG !!!\" great. There is not the scope of nigiri offerings I was expecting-there are maybe 8 nigiri options at dinner. The highest priced sushi rolls were good but for $17 I'm expecting more food and higher quality fish or they need to lower prices on their most expensive rolls by about 10% This restaurant gets five star reviews. It wouldn't get 4.5 stars in a large city where there's an international airport. The sushi in Phoenix can be good. I've yet to experience \"great\" and I've been to about 4 of the highest reviewed places. I also found it odd that this place wants to sell you 5 pieces of Nigiri and 2 pieces of sushi of a particular fish. Do people really want 5 pieces of the same thing or do they want to mix and match? I like to mix and match so I found that really odd. Id think most people want orders of 2 per order-nigiri or sushi-it doesn't matter- so you can try several types of nigiri. Takeaway- if you're from NYC, LA, Chicago, Miami- you're just not going to find the highest quality flavorful raw fish in Phoenix that you're used to where there are large international airports. So, be honest with yourself and If you live here part of the year you need to decide if you're willing to settle for what passes for \"great\" sushi in Phoenix, which so far, for me is, is just pleasant or fine. If you're a Phoenix native then yes- this is close to the best- and I'd suggest that you don't eat sushi at the best places in one of the largest cities in the US on the coasts or you'll understand what I mean. It's all a point of reference.",

My friend got the Kitana rolls and you can tell by the taste that they really put so much thought in how they wanted it to taste. It has a very high quality taste to it. I ordered their Philly rolls which is made with smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado and cucumber. I loved how the flavors just came together and it just melts in your mouth. The smoky flavor of the salmon is just right, nothing too overpowering so it could give way to the avocado and cream cheese flavors of the rolls. We also tried their Spicy edamame. The spicyness was about right. Just a little sting but nothing too crazy. And for the price of just $6, the serving was plentiful. Good for at least 2-3 people. The people were amazing too! They looked all happy and friendly and the vibe is just amazing even if there weren't alot of people earlier. I won't be too surprised if this place starts popping in the next 3-6 months.",

    "text": "Overview: first and last time.   Food: we came during happy hour. Reasonable prices. The sushi on happy hour menu is comparable to prepackaged sushi. Sushi rice isn't soft. More hard texture like slightly uncooked rice. Happy hour quality I guess. I love toro tuna so we ordered the hand rolls-specialty menu. Sushi chef served us the happy hour sushi, them stopped to watch tv behind him. He forgot the hand rolls. He then asked if we wanted to order anymore sushi so we had to remind him we were still waiting for the remaining order. The result was also disappointing. The tuna they provided was not toro. It was not fatty, melt in your mouth, tuna. It was like ahi, raw tuna. I do not recommend it.   Service: so they provided a menu, when we got the bill, it was higher. Apparently we somehow got last year's happy hour pricing, informed them kindly. They apologize and took it off but said just \"letting you know that's not the right price\". Well, that was provided, it wasn't our fault as the customer that they provided the wrong menu. Overall service was so so.   Environment: newer look. Newer restaurant.   Parking: private and spacious.   Overall.. it's cheap low quality sushi. I recommend going up a little north to Hiro where you get high quality service AND quality food.",

    "text": "We frequent Hiro, Kodo, Harumi... This place is not even in the same ballpark. It's like going from a prime filet to a McDonald's hamburger.  We go on a Thursday around 5pm. We were the only people there. Waitress was friendly. We tell her to just give us a \"feed me\". She looks confused, and asked how many pieces, and we said we would just play it by ear and see how we feel. This is what we do at every sushi restaurant we go to. She said she would just put us down for the chef special, and we say OK.  About 20 minutes passes... The sushi chef who was there when we walked in had disappeared to the back before we placed our order. We thought maybe they were making our sushi in the back? Finally he comes out, and he confirms our order, and we say yes. He then STARTED to make our food.   Another 20 minutes passes... Finally our food arrives. We get 5 pieces. Regular tuna, salmon belly, mackerel, yellowtail, and one more that I can't remember. These were BASIC pieces of fish. Dry, not juicy, not flavorful, just thin dry pieces. The toppings were creative, I will give them that. But putting lipstick on a pig doesn't change anything.  We get the bill... It was over $100 with tip! Our 5 pieces were $25?! So basically that's $5 per piece. So for 2 order of tuna nigiri, was $10?! That is the most insane thing I have ever heard. One, the sushi was NOT anything speciak. Two, even if it were delicious, it's overpriced for regular tuna... Not bluefin, not Toro, regular old tuna. Three, it was 5pm... I can go to any other sushi restaurant in Scottsdale and get 2 pieces of tuna for way less at happy hour! And it would have tasted better! Two beers, at $7 a piece, what kind of happy hour is that? Also, their CO2 was not working so they only had bottled!   By the time we ate and paid, we had missed our movie. So much for a date night! We came here because of an awesome pic on Facebook, and I assure you that what we got was nothing like this. Literally the only positive was a friendly server... But waiting a ridiculously long time in an EMPTY restaurant for mediocre, overpriced sushi during happy hour... We will keep going to Hiro and get high quality food, double the pieces, for the same price! No wonder this place is on Groupon... You've got a lot of stuff to work out, guys!",

Our order was messed up a few times, Appetizer potstickers came out not cooked right and cold in the center and hard. Noodles came out wrong and we tried to just keep it to not waste food but the noodles had no taste at all and never came with the vegetables that the waitress said it came with so we had to send it back. We never got asked or offered if we wanted refills for our drinks. When we asked for our bill she got upset that we asked to split it into 3 bills which I have never experienced that being an issue in any other restaurant. She brought our split bills and gave them out with an attitude and even slammed one on the table. We told her how her service was and she did not apologize at all but made excuses that her ONLY other table of 13 people did not complain( they didnt complain cause she gave all her attention to them). If you cant work more than one table then being a waitress might not be for you. We asked to speak to the owner scott and he was not much help also, he didnt even introduce himself. We had to ask over 3 times for boxes and he also didnt apologize until we mentioned that niki couldnt even say sorry. Very rude and disrespectful establishment. The food was okay, not worth going back with that negative environment. We live in the neighborhood and have been here and decided to bring my family thats in town visiting to eat and sucks to have such a horrible experience. Definitely wont be back there again.",

When we said we ordered soup for appetizers the waitress indicated the soups are hand made one bowl at the time and will come out when ready...seriously??? Hot and sour soup and dumpling soup?? Really??? The portions were a good size but the food had no taste. The pad thai was very sour, I love thai food and this did not resemble pad thai. But by far the worse was the hot and sour soup. The smell was nausiating I dared to taste it and the taste matched the smell. I returned the soup, which I never do, but honestly couldn't stand the smell. I have never given a one star but honestly this is the worst Asian food I have ever had.",

I didn't know what was meant by \"korean bowl\" other than the description, but I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised.   It has the sushi rice at the bottom, flavored with rice vinegar, sugar, etc.   The rice was topped with an assortment of leaf lettuce and other mixed greens, sashimi -- is that rice threads? -- seaweed, etc.  It was accompanied by a very tasty sauce that I used to dip the sashimi and lettuce.   It just needed a tiny bit since the sauce was \"strong.\"   I liked it.   I would say it is a \"light\" and healthy meal.  My daughter said her chirashi was good.   It almost looked the same as my bowl.      J's new place is very light, airy and open.  It has a sushi bar and a seating area in the front and along the side.  Very welcoming.  The server Rachel was very friendly and efficient.  There is a patio as well for those cool days.  I would go again to try other items on the menu.",

    "text": "I checked out J's Kaiyo sushi recently on a Friday evening with a few friends. Our experience overall was a bit disappointing to say the least. Mind you, we drove about 20 miles to dine here specifically as we were all in a sushi mood that night & this place was highly rated. The restaurant is nicely decorated and has a cool vibe yet on a Friday night around 7ish it wasn't really busy (maybe 4 tables besides us?). We placed our order for a few appetizers and about 15 min later it still wasn't on the table. We had ordered the Shishito peppers and garlic edamame. I asked our server and he went to check with the kitchen then came back and said \"just a few more minutes\". OK, np we were starving but patient. 10 minutes later we still didn't have our appetizers but they did eventually come out (once we received our entrees). This was not OK but we didn't say anything to our server as I said, we were really hungry. The food looked amazing but the shishito peppers were exceptionally salty, the garlic edamame was just eh because the garlic got burned (you know when you can taste that burnt garlic flavor). The Vegetable Udon was very spicy, too spicy for a few of us at the table. My roll (can't remember the name) was pretty good but my veggie roll was just ok, very small. Our server wasn't as attentive as I expected, waiting around for water after eating spicy food is not ok. I get it, especially on a busy weekend but if it's not that busy I feel attentiveness is important. Overall, for the price I don't feel we received a good value for the experience. Will we be back? Not likely. Too many other sushi restaurants to try closer to home.",

Decor is fresh and clean, Great cocktails wine and beer to choose from.    Now to more The Ramen Bowl, no doubt these guys make their own Ramen and aren't throwing it together overnight.

It rivals the best sushi restaurants in LA and Japan!! Very fresh seafood and creative dishes.  The owner greeted us with a positive happy hello which is rare in sometimes \"snobby\" Scottsdale.  Music playing in background was refreshing(not techno!). Our server(kaylee?) was very knowledgeable with menu items and gave excellent recommendations.  She was also very friendly and made our date night a 5 star experience!  DO NOT confuse J's Kaiyo with the other sushi restaurant next door also with a \"J\"!!!  J's Kaiyo is the only sushi restaurant to go to in Scottsdale!!!  We will be back!",

I like the feel you get, where it can be like your favorite episode of Cheers where everyone knows your name, if you go there long enough. I like finding gems in old town Scottsdale just like this place. Good food, good environments and a present owner. I went the first time with my husband just to check out a new local spot, and it didn't disappoint. Great food, great HH, friendly owner, nice staff. I returned today for a 2nd time, after finding mixed reviews and them not making sense. I like to see for myself and make my own opinions so I returned in need of a good glass of wine and some good food.  I sat at the bar, and the owner was very friendly and attentive. And not in a \"I'm supposed to way,\" but in a genuine way. And aren't genuine people tough to come across these days? I ordered a glass of Kung Fu girl wine, my sister bought me a bottle one time. I kickbox and she thought it was funny. It's also not a bad Riesling. The owner asked if I had had it before, not many order it but it is so delicious, so I told him the story.  I settled on the black pepper beef, and it came out promptly and sizzling hot. The owner even mentioned that they have brown rice now so in my working out self if i wanted that, it's been added to the menu. WOW, so he listened to me too and my story. Sometimes you never know. LOL. The food was wonderful and hit the spot. The owner sent me home with a magnet, in case I need delivery and a card for some edamame. I overheard him talking to another table about Sunday brunch and free wing tuesdays with the purchase of a beverage. I like this place, I like the owner and his staff. This business is tough and I like supporting local. I think I may take my husband to brunch this Sunday, sake bombs and good food sounds delicious.",

    "text": "If you think you are about to eat a normal Chinese takeout meal be prepared to be unbelievably disappointed.  Not sure how this place could have 151 4+ star reviews.   Ordered the crab Rangoons/wontons. They were neatly arranged in the tray but then I looked at the sauce and was dismayed to find some raspberry concoction. Sadly, the wontons were not cooked well and were chewy, probably because they tried to shape it like a tortellini.  Fried rice has a sunny side up fried egg with black sesame seeds? Never have seen that before. I will say the way the shrimp was wok seared gave it a good flavor.   Walnut shrimp dish, not very common to find this dish in town done well. In this case, it may be the worst interpretation I have had the displeasure of trying. No tempura, just a wok seared shrimp. Candied walnuts are normally on the dish, these were some wok seared walnuts.  I have no idea what kind of runny brown sauce was in the tray but it was not mayo and karo.   Lastly we had the orange beef. Cubed beef was the start of this poorly executed dish. I did taste the orange in the dish but only after gnawing on the beef jerky like cubes of beef.   Unless you really want to subject yourself to a poor interpretation of whatever panasian dining is, skip this restaurant.  Maybe their Japanese options are better but I cannot opine on the subject as I only attempted their version of Chinese. I know the restaurant industry is tough and making poorly executed dishes as the ones here is only going to make it a tougher go for this establishment for the future. Dear Chef, at a minimum, please taste the dishes you are putting out for consumption; if panasian means no salt, you nailed it.",

Love the decor, staff was friendly enough, but the food was well...  - Cucumber salad- was beautiful, but awkward to eat with large, irregularly shaped chunks. The miso dressing was tasty when you got some, but overall the dish tasted flat. Maybe cut the cukes smaller and marinate a bit longer? - Edamame- good size bowl, nice and steamy, but a bit too much salt even more me (and that's saying somethin') - Avocado stuffed with crab- this seems to be the darling of food critics, but I just didn't dig it. Lovely presentation, but the crab in the middle tasted more like tuna. I avoided the mango (allergy), but B said it was too sweet; better with a dip in soy. - Loli roll- sans rice and nori was fresh tasty, but ours didn't look like the lollipops I saw on earlier Yelp pics.  - King of Persia- this was the best of the three we tried, loved the tempura green onion - Citrus salmon- had potential, but it had a fishy taste that is never good when eating sushi  - Octopus- this was amazing!! One of the best octo-dishes I've ever had. Perfectly cooked, served over a yummy squash puree. If everything we ordered tasted this good, I'd be 5 star-ing.   Would return for the octopus, and to try a few more of their small plates and salad, but not a sushi destination.",

The dipping sauce for the crab puffs was nasty. I don't even know what it was but it tasted musty and sour.    And don't ask me how the green tea tres leches didn't taste like tea and was DRY! How the heck do you make a dry tres leches?! It was $8, too! And like the chicken, was almost too sweet to eat.  For $8 I don't expect a lot of cake but at least make it good.   In the end this place was a complete disappointment.  If the food was cheap I'd be more forgiving, but it was relatively pricey.   Definitely not ordering from here again",

It has enough sitting to be private and a large sushi bar in the middle. Tvs are on most of the walls so if you want to watch anything I'm sure you will be just fine!   Food: happy hour was great!! I had 2 rolls that were super fresh (spicy salmon and yellowtail) which were $5 each on happy hour. Also had the chicken fried rice, and quite honestly that was some of the best rice I have ever had. It was mixed well and the chicken was great!   Customer service: Scott was walking around the restaurant and greeted us while we were sitting and eating. Very friendly guy and will make sure your visit is up to standards. We had a messup on our check and he fixed it right away for us and even have us some free spring rolls prior to that. Thanks for having a great variety in the menu and providing us all with a local sushi restaurant.",

My first time in I ordered 2 spicy salmon hand rolls and a 2pc yellowtail nigiri for myself, and it was only $11 on happy hour before tip. I went in a second time with my boyfriend and we ordered 5 hand rolls, 4pc nigiri (salmon and yellowtail), and a mixed seafood poke bowl, all for about $35(?).   The fish is fresh and delicious. The first time I had the spicy salmon hand rolls, the fish was cut in larger chunks and absolutely melted in your mouth. I like that consistency a lot more than the super-chopped spicy salmon mix that most sushi restaurants serve.   We also really liked the ambiance. The servers were so friendly and Mallory - the sushi chef - was very kind and answered all of our questions.   I can't wait to come back and explore the rest of the menu! I have my eye on a certain specialty roll...  Edited to mention that the prices above are before tip.",

I also like the way you can ask for a chefs special touch on all your eats and make special each meal. The atmosphere is beautiful and price is good you cant go wrong with \"j's kaiyo\" its the best place to get your fresh sushi in the north downtown scottsdale. It beats the joint across the parking lot by far must try it out.",

Our server was absolutely wonderful, and so was our sushi chef who ensured that we had a great dinner. For appetizers, I had a seaweed salad. It was good. I did wish that it came in a bigger serving. I also had the soft shell crab which I loved. It was cooked perfectly, and surprisingly had a lot of crab meat in it. The pork gyoza was good, nothing special but gyoza is gyoza. We had some of the salmon toro and our chef gave us a free pieces so we can pick between raw or torched salmon toro. Both tasted amazing. I had the King of Persia roll. It was okay; I thought it was very spicy. The spicy salmon roll was delicious. My boyfriend was not a fan of the sushi rice - he thought it was too cold which I agreed. We usually prefer room temperature sushi rice. Between us, we spent about $100. It was pricy but for a sushi place in old town, kind of expected. I will definitely be back when they open for happy hour!",

I hate it when I go to a sushi restaurant and they slice the fish too thin or give you fish that is not his rash. This is not a problem at this place. The service is pretty good and it is not super upscale but the prices are very reasonable and the sushi is fantastic. The happy hour is awesome.",

It was then purchased by a new owner who changed everything including the menu but managed to keep J's Kaiyo's Yelp account ratings, which is why I felt the need to update this review.   I went there before the name change and was unaware of the new ownership, but could tell something was off. The roll I always ordered didn't taste as fresh and there was an obnoxious man in a Tommy Bahama shirt managing the place. It's now completely different and no longer has the magic of J's Kaiyo. Thank goodness Sushi J stayed open.  I decided to stop in for a quick lunch and ordered the pad thai option with chicken... Meh. It tastes like one of those \"pad thai\" bowls or packets you can get in the Asian food aisle at Fry's. The only saving grace was the one server/hostess who was busting her hump during the lunch rush. (There were maybe 5 tables occupied but plenty of people coming and going with takeout orders.) She is the only reason I gave this place 2 stars.",

The place was clean, and had cute decor and furniture. They have a nice patio area and is also dog friendly! Prices were very reasonable -- especially for scottsdale and the food was tasty. We got vegetable spring rolls, crave-able crab puffs, fried rice, orange chicken and a few sushi rolls.  Service was prompt, glasses were always full and the owner even came around to say good evening and chat! We will definitely come back again. They are open for lunch as well and have great happy hour prices!",

I also tried a special roll, which I thought was a little too saucy and overpowered the fish. I considered 4 stars for this but, to be fair, I'm the one who ordered a special roll. Next time, I'll stick with the fresh nigiri sushi and basic maki rolls. 5 stars for those and the service.",

The owner was super friendly, and the server was awesome. I will definitely bring my friends and coworkers back for happy hour.

He even let us put our food in to go when they were at full capacity and under staffed. He was worried that we might wait too long. In reality, I was expecting this at any restaurant open on Christmas. My first impression when we came in: fun decor, great variety in the menu, plenty of seating... The food was great! Mongolian beef and orange chicken. Both our dishes had tender meat, good flavor, and excellent entree to rice ratio. Highly recommend if you are looking for a bistro atmosphere that serves those classic Chinese American dishes we all love.   Merry Christmas Scott and staff!",

They brought the whole staff from the old restaurant so service is great- very attentive and it seems like they make extra effort to get to know you. We had a couple appetizers like the garlic edamame which is new to the menu. We also had the fried rice which is the absolute best. I don't know what they do to make it so good but it is BOMB. Then we had our usual sushi rolls our favorites are the king of Persia, the heatstroke, and the fire dragon.

    "text": "My 4th time at Wok and Roll.  It was promoted heavily on Next-door so I wanted to support a local restaurant.  The first time I came with a friend since owner was giving a free edamame with our order.  We sat on the patio. Food was ok.  Service horrible.  The bartender, female long hair never came out to wait on us and I actually went inside a couple times to order. The place was empty.   My friend didn't want to leave much of a tip because of bad service.  I came in a couple more times and sat at bar.  Tons of waiters standing around, including owner, no customers and again no one waits on you.  The only reason I came back is the prices were decent for wine and owner comped a glass.  Tonight, a Friday night at 7pm, the restaurant was again empty.  I sat at bar 5 minutes and no one came. People, including owner standing around.  I don't get it. I told the same bartender who was running around the restaurant I wanted to order.  She started putting plates on tables instead of taking my order.  The guy next to me said she had a horrible attitude.  Owners daughter came by and I told her I wanted to order.   She on the other hand is actually the only one in the place that cares,  but I was already so irritated by the other waitress/ bartender and owner it didn't matter.  My wine went from $6.00 from last 2 visits (not happy hour) to $9.00 so unfortunately not interested in coming back for just ok food and horrible service, owners daughter excluded.  Take it for what you will but I cannot support a restaurant that doesn't understand that when you have no customers in the place, you don't drive away the ones you have by not waiting on them.  I'm sorry to say,  this place won't make it 3 more months.  Again when a Friday and Saturday night are completely empty, there is something seriously wrong.  Note:  This is a new owner and only recent reviews are for Wok and Roll. Yelp needs to take down the reviews for the previous Restaurant.",

With the delays, I would have expected them to have more time to reach for the stars. Unfortunately, that doesn't appear to have been the case.  When we arrived, the music was so loud, we couldn't sit in the main section of the restaurant. The servers were friendly enough, but I didn't come looking for companionship; I came in hopes of being wowed with professionalism. They fell short. Training is sorely lacking. The food showed flashes of creativity and potential, but it generally fell short of the level I had expected. It was mediocre at best.  There's still time to move it up the ladder, but there's work to be done. For me, I'll be waiting until someone tells me they've upped their game.",

The steamed rice came in a separate container and was fluffy and very good.  Chicken fried rice had large pieces of chicken in it and was also fresh and tasty.  Next visit, i went for the shrimp again and an order of fried potstickers.  First off, the order came out within a very few minutes which meant the food was sitting there waiting to be served.  The potstickers were hard, tasteless and not at all fresh.  The shrimp dish was not nearly as good as my previous order and the rice was in the same container as the rest of the food.  It was clumped together, dry and had a hard crust. it may have been old sushi rice... i couldn't tell. I'm not sure I want to try a third time.   *****11/10/18 Despite what the owner has written about this review, it is not False...it is absolutely real and True.  The rice I got on my first visit ( which was within the past few weeks) was in a separate container and everything i wrote was fact.  I wasn't about to make a special trip back to the restaurant to complain....that's what yelp is for!  I am  not a competitor nor do I know any of Scott's competitors. If I were a competitor I wouldn't have said my first experience was a very good one..I am a customer with a legitimate complaint. I picked up the food myself and went directly home.  I also know what consistency potstickers and steamed rice should be - this was not my first encounter with Chinese food. Scott needs to attach himself to reality and get rid of his paranoia!",

She was very friendly and was very patient with the time it took for us to order because it was our first time there. We ordered the pork rolls, Mongolian beef and the General Tsao chicken (one with white rice and the other with fried) and all three were excellent! There was not a long wait for the food at all, which was great because we were way past our hungry phase. The atmosphere was very pleasant with the music playing at just the right volume to still carry a conversation over dinner. The decor had a bit of a relaxing but fun aspect to it, very good for our once weekly date night. They have a very cute patio area which is going to be perfect for those beautiful spring days and nights. The owner is very pleasant and quite fun to chat with and he saw us out as we were leaving. Overall, this place is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood with great food and service to match. Strongly recommend, especially for a low key date night.",

Now I had never even heard of this place, was just in the mood for sushi but I must say everyone should know about this place! The decor, the happy hour, the food, and the staff! Had an awesome rosemary infused Japanese whisky drink that was fun to see/help  make!  Our sushi was brought out beautifully portioned and had the right amount of everything in each.. some places add too much cream cheese to the philly rolls. But to each their own. I will definitely be coming back soon to try more!!",

    "text": "Get ready for a doozy of a review.   This was probably the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. My friends and I sat down and were not spoken to for about 10 minutes, despite being told we could place our order before happy hour expired.   We finally get to order and it all seemed rushed. Nicole came, took our paper, and was practically running away before I could tell her the additional things we wanted. The only saving grace is we were charged happy hour prices. Or, so we thought.   Over the course of the next hour and a half, things started to take a turn for the worst. We were brought out some rolls, one of which we did not order. When we told our waitress, she said she was positive it was what we marked. Fine, we wanted to eat and get on with our night.   Our next part of the meal came out forty five minutes later. I ordered the Mongolian chicken, which was supposed to include \"wok seared mushrooms.\" My mushrooms were raw and hard as a rock. Fine, I'm not going to complain.   While we were waiting for our nigiri, we overheard our waitress tell staff that she had forgotten to put in our order. Okay, we move on.   The real kicker came when we had already been there for an hour and a half, with no attention from our waitress, we waited around to ask for our bill. When it came, we noticed the rolls we thought we ordered were what we were charged for. Upon telling our waitress this, she replied with, \"Well, what do you want now? Do you want the rolls or not?\" We had already spent so much time there, we just wanted out.   When Nicole came to give us our check, she slammed it on the table, causing some things to knock down, and said nothing. We left, only to realize she overcharged us for one of the happy hour items.   We walked back and asked to speak to a manager about our experience. She told us that she was the manager and asked, \"Why, what do you need?\" She took money from her own pocket and gave us the difference in balance back, which I actually did appreciate.   Overall, if you have a ton of time on your hands for someone to give you something you didn't order cooked/prepared in a way that you didn't ask for, this might be the spot for you.",

The menu is extensive and covers all Asian tastes. And...more importantly, the food is really good.  I highly recommend the Mongolian beef - the meat was tender and the sauce very tasty.  The black pepper chicken was also very tasty and vegetables cooked to perfection.  And I can't leave out the eggplant, one of my favorite dishes. I love eggplant.  Another big plus is that the restaurant is on Miller near Indian School (by Old Town) - a very convenient location with lots of parking!  I will be back soon.",

The new restaurant, called Wok and Roll (at least that's what the banner says over the JsKaiyo sign, is nothing like the original. I am appealing to Yelp to erase the reviews done prior to the opening in September of this year. The sushi at Wok and Roll was not very good. The rice was hard and the salmon was fishy. The other dishes had the same thick (too much cornstarch) dark sauce. Edible but not great.  The service was inexperienced but really friendly and probably the best thing about the place. So please , Yelp, delete my other review which was for JsKaiyo, which I really miss.",

They have plenty of seating and you are allowed to pick the table of your choice. We sat down and the server quickly dropped off our menu.   The menu has a different array of sushi and they have various Chinese dishes as well. We ended up ordering from the Chinese side of the menu.   We ordered a chicken fried rice, a shrimp with broccoli dish, and we ordered a side of egg rolls with crab puffs. They have complimentary cucumber water and it actually tastes really good.   Our food came out some time after and it all looked and smelled pretty good. We dug into the shrimp dish and let me tell you... it was delicious!! The shrimp was cooked perfectly and had such a great charred flavor to it. It also had broccoli pieces and it came with white rice.   The chicken fried rice was a definite no. It was suppppppper salty. We ended up mixing some of our white rice into it to fix the salty situation, and it helped just a tiny bit. The crab puffs were a little too hard and dry for me, but the egg rolls were great! The only downside with the egg rolls was the weird sauce that came with them. It didn't taste so well and it was a weird pairing.   The server again was great but the food was ok. We  did love the shrimp dish though so that's what will bring me back again if I'm in the area.   5 stars because the server was friendly but minus two because our fried rice was too salty. Does the cook not sample what he puts out?",

We decided to order Hung Pao chicken, pot stickers and spring rolls. The Hung Pao was super tasty only wish we had ordered with more heat( our fault) the pot sticker had this thick outer wrap which was delicious and the sauce was . The spring rolls had great flavor and the sweet and sour sauce was perfect for them.  Thanks Scott for your lovely restaurant we look forward to coming back and trying 2-3 more items.

It is SUPER expensive for how little you get and how it's just ehh. We spent a little under 50$. Our beers were 7$ each, and they were so small! Some of the rolls were already falling apart once they came to our table. The Gyoza were really good, a little over fried but tasty. The sashimi my husband got was pretty good as well, but the rolls were just okay. Almost equivalent to buying it at the store (no offense).   After we sat down, it took about ten minutes to have our waiter come back to take our order. A couple at the bar who sat down after us got their food and such way before we did.   My husband and I play HQ, and it came on while we were waiting. The owner (I'm assuming), came to drop our gyoza off and saw the count down and said \"are you timing us?\".... Awkward, even if we were why be concerned...",

We had already ordered drinks and decided that would be it but the glasses tasted soapy and the drinks were soapy as well. We left quickly and decided not to go back. Felt bad for the waitress. Found out this place is only here to spite the owners ex-wife at the other sushi place across the parking lot (Sushi J).",

When you offer to pay for a Birthday drink don't pay half of it pay the whole thing like you say - greed will get ya in the end. It's not worth losing clientele for a few more extra dollars. We shall take our business elsewhere- like RA Sushi on Scottsdale Rd or Totties Asian Fusion in South Scottsdale.",

The rolls were nice, they did have a mixed menu. I ordered the Las Vegas roll, my friends ordered the spicy tuna roll and the Hot wings. The hot wings were good they were not too spicy, they actually had a pretty good taste. The food was decent, the bill was decent as well. I didn't see any out of sight happy hour deals, but I would venture to say I go back again. I wasn't totally wowed, but I absolutely wasn't disappointed either.",

I placed my order to go and 25 mins later I'm still waiting for 2 order of salmon sushi and 1 roll.  When I ask the girl up front where my food is I was told it would be 2 more mins.  Than comes the amazing part.!!!!  The manager comes up and basically bitches as me for not being more understanding since a party of 10 and 6 came in right before me.  So 16 people put the whole restaurant behind 30 to 40 mins.   After waiting another 10 mins a little bag comes out with sushi that looks like I picked it up in the deli section at Frys.  Why can't I give a zero star rating. Wow is all I can say.  Oh and it was $27 bucks.",

The house salad is amazing the dressing is the best I've ever had (and I've been to plenty of sushi places). We got the lunch special and the teriyaki beef special and it was delicious. The sushi rolls were so good, including the California roll (no stick crab here, thank you!) So fresh and delicious. My son is Vegan and they went out of their way to accommodate him with the veggie roll and veggie fried rice, he loved it! I wish this place was in ALBUQUERQUE. BEST SUSHI PLACE IN PHOENIX. You won't be disappointed! Great customer service....enjoyed talking to the owner, he's great! All around great experience and delicious food",

    "text": "Worst experience ever! We are out-of-towners and encountered the worse service from manager/waitress, Nicky and also the owner, Scott. We decided Wok N Roll because it was closest to where we were staying with family. We ordered our drinks, proceeded with appetizers that took 20-30 minutes to get. We ordered steamed gyoza, it was cold and tasted uncooked. We also ordered from the Wok menu, requested noodles with veggies as well as chicken, and the choice of protein was orange chicken but only received plain noodles topped with orange chicken. It was so bland! Very dissatisfying. The service from Nicky just topped it off! She didn't check with us not once. No refills. Finished plates were not removed from the table. We had to ask another server to refill our drinks. She comes to our table, smacking the receipt on the table. It was asked to be split in three-ways and we kindly remonstrated to her about her service. She gives the excuse that she had another party she was attending and felt the need to say \"that they did not complain\" -- excuses!!! To make matters worst, we get the receipts divided incorrectly. We request for the owner after we asked for the manager, until then it was revealed she was and she failed completely to control the situation with her disgusting attitude. Should you be in the restaurant industry, customer service is your top priority! Owner, Scott, comes to our table (didn't introduce himself by the way) and fails to provide a proper apology. Terrible! I recommend if you are visiting from out of town, DO NOT GO HERE! -- the SERVICE was appalling.",

We were down to get some good luck!   Rolls were delicious! We had a few specialty rolls and one veggie roll that was not on the menu, but chef made just for us.

    "text": "In the past I have enjoyed my meals at Wok N Roll but today I had a bad customer service experience which will most likely kept me from returning.  I came in and placed an order to go and paid for the tab with cash. The bill was $42.25 and I paid with $45. Anticipating that I most likely will leave the remaining amount as a tip I still like waiting for the change back and an itemized bill just to make sure everything is accurate. The hostess up front at the register handed me two dollars change back when clearly my receipt said my change was $2.75.  I inquired about the $.75 and she said oh we don't give out change here.  I re-asked for my additional change since my receipt clearly shows that I was supposed to get $2.75 in change. She examined two cast registers and shrugged her shoulders and said sorry there's no change in here. I made it clear that I expected what my receipt showed and she eventually (begrudgingly) came out and gave me my change. So beware of your receipt and your change as there seems to be some skimming happening.",

It wasn't busy but sometimes that means lackluster service and that wasn't the case.  We enjoyed sitting at the sushi bar and had fun meeting some of the other customers which was encouraged by the staff.  The food was tasty. Fish fresh. There was a little something missing in the signature roll selection that we ordered though. They were abundant with variety, but didn't seem to create a cohesive taste.  I am a long time sushi lover and I order different items every where I go to try them out. I wasn't a total fan here, but I'd be willing to come back and try some other options and see if I can hit it better.",

The fish was incredibly fresh, cut well, and served at the perfect temperature so that you could really taste the tuna and the salmon. The rice was properly done - none of that overly sweet Americanized nonsense you get at some places. They had a happy hour (until 6:30pm) so I tried an excellently executed salmon and avocado roll, as well as the pork gyoza. I was surprised the gyoza were deep fried but it actually went really with the yuzu miso sauce, which I could have easily poured over a bowl of rice and guzzled up. My banana whiskey cocktail was just the right amount of sweetness to go well with the gyoza too. I also tried the fresh uni nigiri (SO GOOD) and the King of Persia roll which was very nice with the garlic ponzu and fried green onion. Overall, just everything was good and the miso sauce made me want to try more of the kitchen menu as well as the sushi. Definitely recommend checking this place out!",

Our server, Sande, was outstanding and friendly. We started with appetizers of egg rolls and fried dumplings, which were excellent, and hot. Our entree's of beef Chow Mein and chicken Pad Thai followed and were very plentiful (if it's not spicy enough for you simply ask for chili oil). Both were made from fresh quality ingredients, tender meat, and were hot as well.  If you're into sports TV, they have plenty of televisions and will tune to what you want. There are plenty of options in Scottsdale but, this is one we'll be coming back to. We really liked it!  Don't hesitate to stop, you won't be disappointed!",

Not only is the presentation of food plating unique, colorful & beautiful but is extremely delicious as well! The daily specials at this restaurant never disappoint! They help keep the menu interesting and help me to expand my palette by constantly trying new things. To compliment the amazing food here are specialty cocktails & a large variety of yummie cold sake! (My favorite is the Sayuri then Hakasuru!)-these are a must try! The vibe here is chill yet fun and the owner is always around the restaurant which gives this place a more homey & intimate feel. Plus, who doesn't think it's cool to meet the owner when you go out to dinner?! If you haven't been here then you're missing out! I would recommend this hidden gem to anyone & everyone!!  Oops! Almost forgot to mention the great deals on happy hour! Everyday 430-6pm. So check it out if you're ballin' on a budget! It will be worth every penny plus some",

The interior is so much more beautiful. Very modern and chic. They didn't have a liquor license  when we went, so hopefull that has gone through.  I ordered what I normally ordered....the Marilyn Monroll, and the other \"low carb\" rolls. All are very big yet equally delicious.  I'm sure there's more to come from this sushi chef!",

She handed us food over the counter without a word...  Which is weird and almost rude.  Didn't say, \"Here is your Loli roll,\" (which the Loli is amazing!) or anything.  Just held it over the counter, looked the other way, and waited for us to take it.  Maybe she was having a bad day??? No need to provide bad customer service though.

The head chef is AMAZING and you can tell he really knows his art! The management team and servers were all very helpful and friendly, which made for the fun/hip vibe. The atmosphere is very open and inviting and the perfect spot for dinner with a group of friends! They also have a great patio which will be perfect for those AZ summer nights!! (Just crossing my fingers they make it dog friendly )  The food is incredible! Super fresh and great quality! If you have a spicy side do yourself a favor and try the fire in the mouth roll! Health nut? The lollipop is for you! I'm also a huge fan of the chirashi bowl and the sashimi style dishes like the yellowtail carpaccio! Speaking of yellowtail... order the Hamachi Kama (aka yellowtail collarbone) it's broiled and takes a little time to cook, but it's well worth the wait!!!   Yes, the star of this place really is the sushi but they also have a ton of other non-sushi style options on the menu! Try the chicken katsu and udon noodles... both are delish!!!  Needless to say this is my new favorite sushi spot in Scottsdale!! I'm looking forward to checking out the happy hour in the near future! Yum yummmmm keep up the great work!! #getinmybelly",

It took over an hour to get all the food we ordered and the restaurant wasn't even busy. Our server was very unprofessional (yelling at coworkers in front of us, never checking up on our table, shouting from the bar, mistakenly giving us another roll we did not order and when we told her it was incorrect she told us that WE were incorrect, forgetting our nigiri, slammed our check down on the table, and overcharged us). When asked to speak to a manager, Nicole said she was the manager. Luckily she gave us the difference of the incorrectly charged item back but we just wanted to get out of there at that point. My food was okay, but one of my friends plates had raw mushrooms on it. The terrible service isn't worth the mediocrity of the food, for me at least, but it could be for you! Also, if you need some entertainment, look for the owner's petty responses of some of the bad reviews.",

Slightly spicy!and some sushi rolls which were presented beautifully and tasted fresh...we met Scott the owner who was extremely welcoming...it was so good I wanted to go back the next day! I will be back with some friends and try some more items on the menu.",

Food was good, I ordered vegetable Udon! I added Tofu on top of it which was the star of the dish.  Why one star less because the dish was bit too much sweet for my taste! Soup was sweet! Now that might be my taste and may be broader audience like this taste, so I would recommend go to this place and try there wide variety of dishes!",

You can tell the food is great quality. It's nice to have such a wonderful option close to old town that isn't a tourist trap. Scott the owner is a very nice guy and we're looking forward to supporting this place!",

I never got the green tea. The sushi chef was nice. They seem to have trouble checking out my order with their computers and I got a little flustered and forgot to mention that she never brought me the green tea. It was expensive and not really that amazing. Besides that,  the experience of the service was flustering. I don't think I will be back. Reading the other reviews I don't think I'm missing anything with the Chinese food.",

(You know how that is with sushi) Of course we over ordered and ate it all! Thank you Chef Todd for making us our amazing meal and impeccable service!   Super fresh fish and great selection of special rolls that aren't trendy and lame. Definitely more of an old school meets modern version of sushi at an affordable price for what you get.   The restaurant is crazy CUTE! I do not know how they converted this place from an Arby's to what it's transformed to now. It's tucked away in the Sprouts center near Zipp's off of Camelback and Miller Rd. So a nice quieter departure from the Old Town scene.   Go here now! You won't regret it!",

The staff was a little confused about what is vegan and what is not, and there was a lot of checking with the chefs, which resulted in actually less options than we usually have at other places.  That being said, there were some nice vegan options and we enjoyed what we had.",
