Food was fantastic - I had the brisket which was so tender and succulent (yum) with grilled veggies; my friend had the pulled pork which she said was tangy sweet and smokey - very nice find!",

We have some good restaurants back in Chicago and we enjoy many of them but I have to tell you that we did not expect this restaurant to have such a good food.   We had full size fire roasted baby back ribs, roasted vegetables, baked potato and house salad.  Those ribs were so soft and BBQ sauce was amazing!!! Even vegetables had a scent of the real fire and had a perfect tenderness. Our fully loaded potato was exquisite.  Just a perfect taste.  Salad- was a house salad. Good tasting but Nothing special about it.   If they had mixed greens or spinach- It would be my favorite place.  Nevertheless I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Andrew and Elwira",

    "text": "By far the best BBQ brisket I have ever had. To begin, the staff welcoming us was super friendly then the waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the pulled chicken sandwich, top sirloin. And brisket. Everything was fantastic except the sirloin...it had an amazing smoke flavor and was cooked to my preference however, the texture was very chewy. We told our waitress just so she knew however, she brought out her Manager Laura who was absolutely amazing. They brought out their kitchen manager Jack who gave us the grand tour in the kitchen. He showed us the smoker and explained the process of how everythijng was ran. When we arrived back to our table a brand new plate with an exact replica of my meal was sitting there. The new steak texture was amazing with the same great flavor. I'm positive it was just a bad cut and they went over and beyond to make sure we were pleased. It was a great experience and we can't wait to go back and taste everything. Thanks Bobby Q",

Now whatever pork I managed to find with a search party was in fact tender and has flavor. On to the potato salad I got to say it's good hearty chunks of potato. Finally the calamari ummm pass don't get it if you so tell them \"I'll have and order of disappointment please.\" This was my first time ordering from here and after this letdown it's hard to determine whether or not I'll come back.",

The best still holds as Smoque in Chicago, followed by Bogarts in St Louis, Jack Stacks in Kansas City, and now Bobby Q's in Phoenix. Great ambiance seated outdoors. Great free cinnamon dessert doughnuts. Best damn Peach vodka drink I've ever had, too. The only thing that needs work is the mac n cheese n baked beans. I like the sweet kind of beans over the chili kind.... and real cheese sauce over Velveeta style cheese sauce. Sides are a big deal to me. Their babyback ribs were off the hook as was the beef ribs and beef brisket. Excellent free cornbread, too! Would totally eat here again!",

I will bring my family here when we return. I ordered the pork ribs, which were tender and not too much sauce on them. Our table opted to try all three sauces, all were good, but my personal favorite was the spicy one. The fries were a little too salty for my liking, which was probably a good thing since I didn't stuff myself with them. Unbeknownst to us, the meal ended with hot mini donuts rolled in cinnamon and sugar, all packed in to-go bags.",

    "text": "As a Phoenix native, how the hell have I not been here before? Honestly, I skipped this place because I heard it was a club. And a BBQ place. But I've never heard of friends coming here for BBQ, only drinking. It's on a rough-ish side of town. WHY THE F*CK ARE THEY TELLING ME ABOUT DRINKING HERE AND NOT EATING? Skipped this place for years. Mistake. I recently started back up at school and had to drive down the i17 for many miles a couple times a week. I ride a motorcycle and never had to look at the signs when I passed this place. IT SMELLS SO F*UCKING GOOD!! I always knew when I was passing Peoria/Dunlap. I decided to have my birthday dinner here despite having never been before. I call the day-of my dinner and make a reservation for 20. No problem. They ask if I want separate checks while making reservations. Being in the industry, this is a good sign. They greeted us all with waters and we had two servers. We all get served basically at the same time. Impressive.  Best ribs I HAVE EVER EATEN, EVER. Dope. At this point I'm pretty hammered and totally feeling myself. They bring me a fuggin complementary  dessert with a candle and now I am vaguely remembering my friends signing to me...BUT I AM SO FULL. What the actual F*CK am I supposed to do with this ice cream? I take a bite and all of the sudden there are these little baggies of the best donut things I've ever put in my mouth. So hot and perfect and mushy and yum. I need to go back. Seems like a perfect place to grub and then party on. Next time I'll get less drunk at dinner and try to venture into the club scene they have. Hopefully it isn't too hood!! Lol",

It was very moist, and delicious I enjoyed the meat entrees very much. What I didn't care for was the Mac n cheese it was a little too velvetta for my taste. It resembled the Mac n cheese from KFC. The coleslaw was delicious as well as the baked beans. I would probably eat here again but keep in mind for peeps from Los Angeles it's comparable to claim jumper IMO. But the service was A+++ and family friendly atmosphere. But this is coming from a person who frequents Bludso's BBQ in Compton so I feel like I have higher standards. Lol but definetely worth a try.",

The food was very good (brisket sandwich and pulled pork sandwich), but not the best I have ever had. BUT the whole experience was probably the best I have ever had in a restaurant. Started out getting 4 corn \"muffins\" (I don't know what these hockey puck shaped things were called but they were delicious.) We did not expect this since we were getting sandwiches.  Awesome server (Vince) was genuinely nice as well as efficient. Two managers came by in the short time we were there, enthusiastically encouraging us to get drink refills (after already getting several without asking) and wanting opinions about food and service. Then, not getting dessert and ready to leave, we were presented with a bag of fresh warm donut holes...a LOT of donuts.  The whole experience was outstanding and was right up there with all our memories of our week in Arizona.",

    "text": "When I saw quite a few of my Yelp friends checked in at Bobby Q, I definitely couldn't pass up a chance to go. We went on a Friday night and the wait for a table was about an hour and a half. This was a little bit longer than expected, however we figured we would grab a drink and wait. After seeing how large the drinks were that others around us had ordered, we decided on just one cocktail called Shipwrecked. It was large and pretty sweet with a blue raspberry-coconut flavor. Since this was the type of fruity drink I typically gravitate towards, I was satisfied and would get it again.  Their estimate on the wait time was fairly accurate so about an hour & a half later, we were seated at a table on their outside patio. Our waiter was friendly and came by our table immediately. He went over the menu items and suggested some of the meat plates and sides. I ended up getting a Pulled BBQ Chicken Sandwich with a side of Mac & Cheese (which multiple servers seemed to be recommending) and my fiance got a three meat plate with the baked potato and mashed potatoes. While we waited, we were brought out some warm cornbread and butter to enjoy, and a short while later, our food arrived.  After tasting a little bit of everything that we got, I wish I would have ordered one of the red meats instead of the chicken sandwich only because it was so plain compared to the other items. I'm not a huge fan of red meat which I was pleased to see chicken on the menu, but the red meat had the actual BBQ flavor I was hoping to find. All the side items were good; I personally liked the mashed potatoes the most but my fiance liked the mac and cheese the most. The chicken sandwich plate and side was small enough for one to finish entirely but we had some leftovers from the three meat plate.  After we were done with our meals, we were brought a small bag with some cinnamon sugar covered donuts. I had seen a couple of people making them fresh at the front of the restaurant when we walked in, so this was definitely a nice & unique treat.  Overall, I would definitely be up for coming back here and giving some of the other menu items a try ... 4.5 stars, just not quite 5.",

It's a spacious restaurant with plenty of room for large parties and there's also a full bar so you can order from their drink menu or have them make whatever you want.   Our table ordered baby back and St. Louis ribs, brisket and sausage. Entrees come with sides so we got a few of them. The sides were ok, nothing special. The BBQ was pretty good. The brisket was almost too soft though, crumbling into smaller pieces as we picked at it. But it tasted good, smokey and flavorful. My favorite, surprisingly, was the sausage. And it was perfect with their tangy Carolina BBQ sauce. We also ordered appetizers, spinach dip and these brisket-filled egg rolls. Spinach dip was good that came with really garlicky garlic breads, so that was good. And the brisket rolls are their most popular appetizer for a reason.   The food was good but it was really the service that impressed me. Even with how busy they seemed the food came out very fast. Our server, Julie, took the time to explain things to us and was very attentive and patient. The icing on the cake is that they bring out donuts for dessert! Warm, sugared donuts. So good and that was such a nice surprise. Good eats that was reasonably priced and we were treated very well. I'm coming back for sure.",

The Mac and cheese was basically velveeta, the baked potatoes were super dry and did have anything special about them except they were huge, and the ranch baked beans. Don't let the staff fool you into how special they sound. Had what hey call Q Tips, brisket or pulled pork wrapped in tortilla and deep fried, with a chipotle ranch or bbq sauce, those were special. I'd eat nothing but those and corn bread if I ever come back.  PS:  water is absolutely disgusting but I'm finding that's everywhere in Vegas.",

This is my first time to come and eat at this restaurant. And now I understand why this business spot got so many excellent and high reviews on Yelp.   Going to a restaurant does not simply means putting your butt on the chairs and eating what ever they give you. It also means enjoying your meal and satisfying your taste.   Bobby Q just has everything it need to be the best Phoenix steakhouse. The price is not too bad if I compare to what I enjoy when eating here. My friend and I ordered the Two Rib Combo which includes two sides. We want to share, so the staff put on two different plates for us. We finish our lunch with ice cream. We decided to pick Death by chocolate, but the guy recommend me to pick Miss Mcgee's Mud Pie. That was delicious.  We came there pretty early, only three tables have people. But when we left, they were all full. Such a popular and crowded business.  My dad is a steak lover, so next time I will bring my family here. I know he will love it.",

Excellent! The rolls were plump not skimpy. It's actually big enough for a entree. They bring out cornbread as well and let me tell you best corn bread I have ever had.   Now for the entree. I ordered the BBQ brisket with mac and cheese and shoestring fries (the best kind of fries). It was such a big plate. I probably could have shared it. Needless to say I took about have Home.

    "text": "Had a great birthday dinner at Bobby Q's with my parents. We ordered the whole hog platter (~$49), which was perfect for the three of us with a small box of leftovers--St Louis ribs, Baby back ribs, brisket, sausage, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and baked beans. The meat fell off the bones with ease and the mac and cheese was my favorite of the side dishes. Everything had lots of flavor!  Besides the delicious food, the customer service was wonderful and went above and beyond our expectations, which made our meal and experience even better. Our appetizer plates had some dried food on it so we asked for a new set. So the manager, who was very personable, came over and apologized and gave us, which we didn't expect. Our servers were great at giving us recommendations on the menu and helped us decide on mud pie for dessert, which was the perfect choice for us--be sure to leave room because it's a big slice!  Legit BBQ spot. Will be back again if I'm ever in town again!",

The chicken was fantastic. The beef ribs were not very meaty but were sweet and tasty.  My real complaint was the ribs. The baby back ribs were good, but a little overdone. I couldn't pick them up without them falling apart. Personally, I think they should be firm enough to hold together when you cut them and pick them up. But if I give the bone a firm tug, it should come out. It's a fine line and easy to cross. Bobby Q crosses the line, but all in all it's a very good BBQ joint. Given the competition in Arizona, it's easy to see why they are so successful.",

Since we had never been to Bobby Q's, our server explained how they handled their meat, the BBQ process, their original drink menu, and even helped us decide on our meal choices.   When the meal came we were floored. The ribs were moist, tender (falling off the bone), and well seasoned. The steak was perfectly cooked , flavorful, and tender. We enjoyed the meat so much we merely sampled our sides!   I would definitely suggest this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal!",

Very busy with a young to middle age crowd.  Dance floor opens at 8PM on certain nights and that may (or may not) change the demographics.  Bobby McGees was great...this place is doing pretty good too!   But, let's keep this place a secret for now, OK?    Highly recommended (shhhh, quiet...)  3.75 stars if I could swing it.

We had the Whole Hog dish with beef ribs, briquet, and rotisserie chicken. Our sides were coleslaw, baked potato, Mac and cheese, and vegetables. It fed three people and we still brought some home.   Everything was exceptional!   My only qualm, and it's a small one, not enough good vegetables. A few squash and mushrooms but mostly onion and bell pepper filler.

    "text": "Bobby Q is an amazing BBQ joint. Highly recommend it! The ambience is warm and fun. The service was exceptional. It was my first time and the waitress was very well versed about the food and how it is prepared. She made great recommendations. The cornbread was so good and rib meat slip off the bone. Sides were okay. I enjoyed the grilled veggies, but the Mac n Cheese not my favorite. Dessert, Banana pie, is a must! We were approached several times by two managers and our waitress definitely checked in a few times. It was very nice, but our conversations were interrupted several times throughout the evening. Less interruptions ideal. If I am ever back in Phoenix, AZ I would definitely return.",

You walk in and it doesn't look like a typical BBQ place. Looks more like an upscale fine dining place. We got seated and was greater by the server who had to tell how good the restaurant is and all the awards and everything it's won.. I really don't care let the food do the talking.. I ordered the Texas ribs and they were huge and very good. The biggest down fall of this place is the prices. Seems liken your paying for the big huge fancy restaurant more then u are the food. That being said food was amazing there corn bread was very very good and the whole experience was very good just a little high priced IMO.",

I had originally ordered the brisket, but due to an error from the kitchen I ended up with ribs. The only regret I have now is I live so far from Phoenix. Nothing will compare. And I consider myself a rib aficionado. \"Hunter\" our server was knowledgeable, efficient and attentive. He told us the brisket  meat was cooked 22 hours. I tried my friends, and it was delicious. Even the side dishes were noteworthy. My favorite was the potato salad. A bit on the creamy side, but just the way I like it. Not an inexpensive dinner, but one that you won't soon forget. I can taste it now.l as I write this.",

The crowd was right - best tasting ribs we have had in a long time! The meat was not greasy but fell off the bone and the sauce just the right combination or sweet and vinegar.  When you sit down they bring you complimentary hot cornbread and butter which melts in your mouth. Baked potato comes loaded with sour cream, butter, bacon, cheese and chives - it was amazing. We had the ice box banana cream pie for desert and one was big enough to share. They also bring piping hot fresh mini cinnamon sugar  donuts in a brown sack at the end of the meal.  Service was excellent too! Food was brought out very fast and piping hot. The visit by the manager after our food was served to check to see if we needed anything was a nice touch.  We cannot wait to come back - the chicken also looked fabulous!",

    "text": "Since we loved Bobby Q in Mesa, we decided to see what the \"Original\" location in Phoenix had to offer. I don't know who runs this place or the other, but I'd LOVE to meet him/her or them. The service at this place it top notch and far surpasses that of any 5 star, fine dining establishments I've ever been to. I am a firm believer that food may come up short from time to time. Maybe a recipe wasn't followed. Maybe there's a new cook in the kitchen. Maybe they are so slammed the kitchen cant keep up, etc.. It's a bummer when that happens but most often people will return to try it again. But... a server is on stage, in front of their guests, until the last curtain call. They really have no room for error without getting scrutinized and skinned alive. And they tend to take the hit for the entire restaurant. If the food is bad, for some reason it's easier for people to take it out on the server. If it took an hour to get a table, somehow it's the servers fault. If an entree was missed and didn't make it out to the table...yep it's the server's fault. Am I wrong?  Well here is where I'm going with this. The service at Bobby Q is so cream of the crop, that  in the unfortunate event of any one of the above mentioned scenarios, I can't foresee it ever being an issue.  Our server Donald, was more than just an order taker. He was a True experience maker, and we had the best time with him. I asked him about a couple of cocktails I was torn on. He was honest about one of them, the Watermelon Cooler, and let me know it's not for everyone and it gets sent back quite a bit. I ordered it and LOVED it. It tasted like a Jalapeno infused, Watermelon Margarita. I love spicy margaritas and this cocktail was right up my alley!  The food was also superb. I had beef ribs as well as 1/2 rack baby backs, accompanied with Mashed Potatoes and Mac N CHeese!  PSA: There is absolutely no dainty way to eat the beef ribs. Just accept the facts, get in touch with your inner Caveman, and go to town! Nom, Nom, Nom... while you're feasting, try to remember you are in public, people may be watching, so keep the growling to a minimum.  At the end of our meal, we were so full, we regretfully declined dessert. We did however find a tiny bit of room for the complimentary mini donuts. I actually asked if we could order some to go. To my pleasant surprise, they sell them by the dozen! And, to my ultimate surprise our server brought us a few extra donuts, told us not to leave, and came back with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!! Whhaaaaaaat?? Omg... mind blown and super yummy! All in all Bobby Q. has it together from start to finish and you will not be disappointed! Be sure to ask for Donald, he's one of the best!",

Our first waiter before moving to the bar area (happy hour only in the bar area) asked had we ever been here, we have not. He gave us a nice rundown. Asked about happy hour and moved us to the bar so we could partake.  Our next waitress, Jessica, came over and explained to us similarly after we told her we've never been. She gave me a drink rec, the princess peach. It was so good I ordered it twice. She brought complimentary corn bread. PHENOMENAL. Some of the best if not THEE best cornbread I've ever had. We ordered our food, it came faster than we anticipated. We both ordered the brisket sandwich and Mac and cheese. The brisket was sooo tender. The Mac was sooo creamy and cheesy. If you're ever in the area of a Bobby Q please come. You don't regret it. We haven't left yet but they give mini donuts to go. Looking forward to those as well!",

The food was fantastic.  I was with a party of 8 and everyone raved about the food.   Our server was Christopher and he was an outstanding server.  He made what was a great experience with our meal even that much better.    We were an 8-top which I am sure can be a pain for any server especially splitting a check 3 ways but you would never know that given how professional and attentive Christopher was.    Thank you Bobby Q's and Christopher for making a normal Sunday night dinner into a memorable one.",

He helped us pick some great menu items and it came out quick!   Meat was perfect, my baby back rips fell right off the bone and their bbq sauces are quite flavorful.

    "text": "I'll be honest, this place has excellent BBQ. Although, couldn't say the same about their customer service. My daughter is graduating from college (first our family so BIG accomplishment) and she wanted to go to this restaurant afterwards for lunch. I called a week in advance to place a reservation on Thursday, April 25th at approximately 1 pm. (Mistakenly, I did not write down the name of the woman I spoken.) After I gave her the details pertaining the reservation, she asked me for a credit card. Quite shocked, I asked if there would be a cancellation fee or anything like that. She told me no and I was boggled. I kept asking why my credit card information was needed and she danced around the subject for a while. Finally, she told me there was a \"no call no show\" fee (basically a cancellation fee).   After a lot of prodding, she finally explained that my credit card would be charged $10 each person if my party failed to show up. A PARTY OF 14 PEOPLE. Once again, boggled.   In conclusion, I will not be taking my business back to this establishment as they have tried to scam me and my family. The women on the phone was VERY reluctant to tell me the full picture and I had to pry for an answer.   Just wanted to share my experience so no one else gets scammed by Bobby Q's and this ridiculous policy.",

We were told the meat was smoked for 14 -18 hours by one waiter and 6 hours by the bar tender which we were a little confused by. We ordered the family meal so we could taste multiple items from the menu......we were not impressed at all. The meat did not have a smoked taste to it at all. It tasted like the meat was boiled and maybe  smoked for an hour. Very disappointing. The bbq sauce takes like a cheap sauce you can got at the grocery store. The mac & cheese tasted like they made it with the kraft cheese that comes in the plastic. Yuck.....The best part of the whole meal was the donuts at the very end. I do not  recommend this restaurant if you are look for some bbq. We will not be returning.",

    "text": "(4 stars for my overall smokehouse favorites, 5 stars for PHX up to this point)  On my continual quest for savory smoked, grilled and BBQ goodness, I decided to stop in. I initially entered the \"Q Lounge\" to check out the Happy Hour which obviously has a huge following and offered a HH buffet and numerous drink specials. While interesting and entertaining, I wasn't feelin' it so after about an hour, I wandered back into the main restaurant. Taking a seat at the bar I ordered up a rather potent and tasty Margarita and looked over the menu.   Decisions....this looked promising. The wonderful smoke aroma mildly permeating the restaurant gave me further hope that I was getting into something good. Opting for the 2 meat combo with brisket and sausage with roasted corn and mac n cheese on the side, I was looking forward to the meal.   Served relatively quickly, I stuck my fork into the mac n cheese. I was told it had 5 cheeses. It was quite rich with a very Velveeta like palate and a slight tang of cheddar. The corn was truly roasted, cut off the cob and served up neatly in a bowl. The brisket was tender, smokey and amazing. Well marbled, not too lean and not too fatty. The smoked sausage was not overly smoked, well seasoned and with just enough bite (I will have to try the jalapeno variety next time to compare).  The serving size was plentiful. And I had enough left over for the next day!  [Still not Rudy's....my quest continues.]",

Ordered baby back and spare ribs and sausage- their ribs were so tender and tasty. Highly recommend spare ribs, aka St Louis style ribs. Meatier and juicier cut of the two. Highly recommend it. Their sausages were great also- it wasn't fatty at all. Their corn bread was like eating a price of a sweet cake: sweet and a ton of flavor. No need to order a dessert- just ask for extra corn bread. :) highly recommend this place to anyone!",

So my friend and I had dinner tonight and we were seated by the lovely manager Rennie who was just so delightfully cheerful. Then we got the best server in the place Jack. I decided to change it up and get something other than the ribs so I chose the two meat combo. OMG the  pork and brisket was to die for and I was not disappointed at all. My food was full of flavor and the meat was tender and juicy you could cut it with a fork. I had chose this plate because my friend ordered the same and she made it sound so good and I was not sorry for not ordering the ribs which are oh so delicious as well. Jack was quick and on top of keeping our drinks filled and making sure we were taken care of so if you decide to dine here ask for him. When we had finished our meal we were pretty full and had opted not to have dessert but Jack was such a sweetie and came out with this heavenly chocolate ice cream cake. I was so full but this cake was just so darn good. I am home now happy and full with my puppy who is licking my bbq scented face lol. I had an extraordinary dining experience and will undoubtedly be back very soon. Sorry no pics were taken because the food was too good I forgot :) next time though.",

The place was packed and we had to wait about 25 mins, this was a good sign. Our server Michael was amazing, personable, warm, friendly and very helpful with our ordering and everything else.  We told Michael we were not going to have a fridge in our hotel room, so did not want leftovers.  He suggested we share a plate since the portions are large.  We ordered the beef ribs with mac and cheese and bar b q beans and an extra side of mac and cheese.  The mac n cheese was generous and creamy and cheesy, there was a cheddar flavor in there that just made you want to sing. The bar b q beans was so flavorful and plentiful and the beef ribs were smoky and tender and the bar b q sauce was to die for.    Renie came by as we were eating to make sure we were happy with our meal.  Nice classy touch, we were emphatic fans by then.  She also told us to save room for the complimentary fresh doughnuts to be delivered at the end of our meal.  Wow!  And they did not disappoint.  The doughnuts where so hot we had to be careful, this should be the ONLY way doughnuts ought to be served. Do not walk, run to this place, you will not be disappointed.",

It surprised the hell out of me to find out they averaged 4.5 stars. Now, me and Kathy are huge BBQ fans and wanted to balance out our weekend with a meat splurge. We decided dinner was going to be how it was going down...  Again, the stoopid Google Maps app fails us again and has us feeling our way to Bobby Q. We finally get there and got sat down immediately. We got served a basket of cornbread that looked like hockey pucks. There was a crunchy texture on the outside, while the inside was moist and fluffy. It was spectacular, but don't fill up on them, unless you are on a diet and weren't ordering anything else. I'm usually skeptical of ordering brisket, unless I know there was some Texas affiliation. Lots of the Yelpers raved about the brisket and when the waitress recommended it, it was a no brainer. What was difficult was what else to order.  We settled on the the Whole Hog Heaven, after much debate between me and Kathy and interrogation of the waitress. The Whole Hog Heaven is their best feast where you can choose 2 BBQ meats and 2 pit ribs types, plus 3 sides. We went with brisket, smoked sausage for the meats and St Louis ribs and Texas beef ribs. For the sides, we ordered the mac n cheese, roasted corn and shoestring fries.  First off the bat, the brisket was as good as advertised by Yelpers (thanks, y'all) and our waitress. Juicy, moist and tender with a smoke crust gives the brisket an unforgettable experience. Another winner was the St. Louis ribs. It literally fell off the bone and was oh so tender. The sausage was good, but not outstanding and the beef rib was also just acceptable. Against the waitress' suggestion for their \"smoasted\" chicken, I do think I will try the smoked roasted chicken and the baby backs next time. All of the sides were tasty, but the stars were the brisket and St. Louis ribs.  To top off a grand BBQ evening, we were given a brown paper sack of mini donuts that were sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. That's a nice touch. Overall, I give Bobby Q a solid 4 stars on the basis of the brisket. You can have a brisket sandwich and die happily, and yes, its that good! The service was good and the food came out fast.   I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu. There was a couple next to me,  who ordered enough for a small army. The guy raved about how the Southern Fried Chicken was the best he had ever had. The dude looked like a food heavyweight, so he must have had a few country fried chicken in his lifetime, so I'm adding that to the list.  Until next time, BBQ compadres...",

    "text": "came to bobby q's and split the lunch platter with a friend. we got the brisket, ribs, BBQ chicken and mac & cheese and added a side of mashed potatoes. i appreciated that they split everything for us in the kitchen and then sent out our order on separate plates at no extra cost; nice touch! everything was freaking DELICIOUS and i highly recommend the brisket. my only sort of issue was that the side we added was $4 and it wasn't a large portion at all. BUT for $10 a person including tip, we were able to try a couple different things and leave full but not too full so i'll call that a win. i will definitely be back to try dinner and to sit on their gorgeous patio when phoenix doesn't feel like the surface of the sun. it also looked like they had a good HH!",

The food (I had the sirloin, she had brisket and chicken, we had mash, baked potato, mac and cheese, and vegetables, all of which were tasty), the locale (more upscale than I would ve expected for a bbq place), and the service (ask for Dana, she was the dot on the i in my opinion with good recommendations, excellent attention to our needs, and a generally extremely pleasant disposition) all combined to make this place the highlight of our weekend in terms of a food experience.  Would absolutely recommend going to Bobby Q if you're in the mood for bbq and find yourself nearby.",

The outside was rustic and country which I absolutely love for bbq places but then wen u go inside its fancy! Haha which gives u the feeling that ur in for a different kind of experience. Love it. And there is an outdoor patio. The cornbread is phenomenal and they give u free cinnamon sugar donuts as a thank u, no need to order dessert! And the BBQ, great smoked wings app and the Q rolls are great. The brisket sandwich is great also. We will definitely be coming back here. The manger Ashley was very sweet and helpful around the restaurant. Brodie was our waiter and he was very personable and professional he was great. Donny (not sure of spelling) the manager was very nice and smiley which was cute. They made us feel like we can just shoot the shit. So thank you Bobby Q, we will most definitely be back. Oh yea! And weird add but their napkins are elite!",

Their sauce ranks up there with some of the best and you can order mild, a little hot or both to try. We haven't tried the ribs but intend to do so at some future visit. Our waitress tonight was Emily and she made sure we were fully enjoying our meal. Prior to serving the main course, we were served warm cornbread with butter, Yum. After finishing the entree with cole slaw, we were then treated to warm mini-donuts fresh out of the oven. We give Bobby Q five out of five stars. Oh, if you plan to give them a try, you might consider making a reservation as they tend to stay busy. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.  Michael Wright",

From Meagan B.'s thread: <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/topic/phoenix-yelp-phoenixs-10-firsts-of-2016\">yelp.com/topic/phoenix-y...</a>  Bobby Q's was on our way back from our weekend trip up north and it was around lunchtime so we figured we'd get something from there to go so we could eat it back at home. The menu was easy to browse through online. I called and placed an order for the three meat combo which would be ready in 15 minutes.  There are two areas in this restaurant. The front is for dining in while there is a separate back parking lot and take out entrance. Service at the counter was friendly and they even offered me a drink while my order was being put together.   The smell of BBQ in the car was mouth watering as we drove back home. I ordered the combo with baby back ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. For sides I had the roasted corn and coleslaw. The meal also included 2 pieces of cornbread and they gave me some extra BBQ sauce.  All the meats were very tender with smoky flavor. My favorite of the three was probably the pulled pork, followed by the baby back ribs. The brisket was good and they included fatty and lean pieces, but the memory of the superb brisket from Little Miss BBQ still lingers in my memory as one of the best I've had.  The sides were excellent. The roasted corn also had some smoked flavor and the coleslaw was crisp, tangy and refreshing.  Overall it was a good meal and I do like how they have more convenient hours and better atmosphere than Little Miss BBQ. I will be back for more BBQ!",

The restaurant is a little hidden off the free way but it's very pretty inside and has a big lot light up patio that is pretty at night time.  Food was super good, service was great, and a very  modern/fun atmosphere. This would be a great place for date night, family dinner, and even late night drinks. They serve cornbread to start which is delicious and then end the meal with complimentary fresh cinnamon sugar donuts with your bill. I got the loaded BBQ brisket baked potatoe which was very good and large portion. It came with a side of the mac n cheese which was the best I have ever had. My fiance got the ribs which he said were amazing and the meat just fell off the bone. They serve the meals with home made hot BBQ sauce which is delicious.   Price is moderate to high depending on what you get. You could get a big platter to share with a few people for a good price. I will definitely be back and continue to use them for catering .

Luckily, my friend yelped and found this place nearby. We sat ourselves at the bar. The food was outstanding! Not only did we LOVE our food, we met a regular that was hilarious and had schtick with our bartender/waiter. She was very funny! Oh.. and that was some quick service indeed!  There is a nightclub attached to Bobby Q. My friend and I did venture on over to check it out, but it was definitely NOT our scene or music. Very Vegasy. So, maybe skip that.. unless you are 23 and like Vegas clubs.. Or are like us.. and blog about traveling and check out things we would not normally visit. Or - if you want to dance off your meal, maybe? No.. wait.. I don't think you should do that. The food is really fantastic and should get to stay cozily in your stomach until it's good and ready to part ways.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.DartandMap.com&s=cb305c8689263c2ac2a42962ef2a29d956b493e0e7f1289aa2625980666bbab1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">DartandMap.com</a>",

It's far and away better than anything to be had in southern California and comparable to the mid-range places in more BBQ-centric parts of the U.S.  In Phoenix, that puts it at 4 stars and I'd give it 5 if I didn't have such a great experience at another BBQ joint a month before in another state.  Bottom line: if you desperately need a BBQ fix, you could do a lot worse in Phoenix and if you are a little less desperate and just looking for some good BBQ, you will still leave satisfied.",

Beer chose was good, quantity was good but lacked on quality for the price. I ordered the 3 meat planning on leftovers work well. But one of the friends at the table ordered the 1 meat meal for $18.00 and chose brisket. He had less brisket than I had (assuming I got a 3rd portion) and it was grizzly.

As none of us were in a state to drive but desperately needed dinner we decided to check out Bobby Q. We were definitely worried about what we were getting ourselves into given the neighborhood surroundings but once we walked through the doors of Bobby Q we were pleasantly surprised.  The menu was incredible. Every BBQ option under the sun. All meals started with some great corn bread. The beer selection was phenomenal! We ordered a bunch of different things on the menu and loved every single one. Personally I had the rib combo plate and enjoyed every bite. My one regret was ordering the baked beans as one of my sides. It wasn't bad but just seemed average in comparison to everything else. Definitely get the mac and cheese!  This was definitely the best surprise of our trip and we will definitely be heading back next year!",

I ordered Bob's Salad and wasn't very impressed, but that's what I get for ordering a salad at a barbecue place. My mom ordered the sampler from the lunch menu with brisket, chicken and ribs and THAT was amazing. The brisket was perfectly tender and fell apart as soon as I stuck my fork in it. The ribs fell right off the bone, and something about the flavor set it a notch above. We were a little disappointed that we weren't offered dessert, because we had planned on ordering it, but the server (who was still in training) didn't give us an opportunity to ask and disappeared after dropping the check. Everyone there is very friendly, the management is very attentive and the atmosphere is unequaled. I would love to host my next event there!",

I took 1 bite and sent it back! The manager came over dressed in pajamas and UGH BOOTS on. The table where I sat was right in front of the kitchen and I saw her giving the staff as well as the guests dirty looks. She is was so unprofessionally dressed for a manager. The food was so over rated as well as our waitress who apparently feels it is acceptable to dress crappy too just like the example being set by her Manager. I got ONE re fill the entire time I was there and I had WATER !!! ugh, my bill for 5 people was $142.00 including gratuity. I would never go back !!   WAY OVER RATED !!",

They certainly deserve their top 100 rating! While the food was positively spectacular (the ribs are worth dying for); Dylan, our server, made our experience 100% complete!!! Dylan was a shining example of hospitality and service, a star amongst the staff. He had a massive impact on our stay in Pheonix, and was a supremely positive representative for not only Bobby Q's, but also for this beautiful city! We highly recommend this restaurant as a worthy stop for any traveler passing through the Pheonix area, and we will most definitely be returning on our next trip!",

We both ordered adult beverages and both were great. We started with the spinach and artichoke dip, awesome choice! My wife ordered the salmon which is a good size portion and she really enjoyed the flavors! I stuck with my favorite pulled pork, one of the best I've had. The food is great and Bailyee, our server is awesome!  Chef Mark, your staff redeemed themselves this time around. Please let Bailyee know we truly enjoyed her and wish she could be our server each and every time!

Its in a bit of a lonely area and can be hard to miss if you're not sure what you're looking for. But once you make it, you will not be disappointed. This place definitely gets 5 stars for its service; everyone from the host, the bartenders, our server and even the manager were super friendly! We were seated very fast, despite being initially told we'd have an 1 hour plus wait (not complaining). Now, let me tell you about the food: AMAZING and food porn worthy! I had the prime rib and BBQ chicken combo with roasted corn, mac and cheese and a baked potato *drool* The prime rib was sooo tender and had a nice smokey taste to it (I wish I had the 14 oz instead of the 8oz). The bbq chicken was great. The roasted corn and mac and cheese, wow. Even our complimentary corn bread was mouthgasmic. Extra stars for the food coming out at lightning speed.

Tonight I tried the smokehouse burger and was extremely impressed with the flavor and quality. Portion size is it generous and the staff is top notch. I always look forward to my next visit to Phoenix!",

They're like flautas made with brisket, accompanied by two dipping sauces.  Simply Amazing!  Ray also recommended the whole hog entree with brisket, pulled-pork and baby backs.  It was large enough for my wife and I to share.  Delicious and filling.  My daughter ordered the half chicken plate, and their fries are superb.  We finished it off with a peach cobbler, and to our surprise, we were presented with a bag of Thank-Q's (accompanying our check), which were freshly made dough balls coated in cinnamon & sugar.  Very good!  If we lived closer, we'd be a fixture in this place.",

Turns out on the other side of the restaurant you have a lounge area where it's blasting with music. Such a big restaurant!!  Our waitress was super nice, gave us some delicious cornbread first thing, and then gave us more. My boyfriend and I shared the two meat combo, with brisket and roasted chicken, and we chose mashed potatoes and mac and cheese for our two sides. It was delicious.  **^ this was written a while back and I never finished writing it. I've been back since and the food is still delicious!

Our service was weird, it was multiple people but no one around when we actually needed anything. Our food took a very long time too. The table who sat next to us were seated and got their food before we received our 2 orders. Although it took what felt like forever for our food it was great like I expected.  By the time we were able to leave it took quite some time to get our bill, pay and even ask for a box all while servers were rushing around past us to help other people but no one to really help us. Once we were finally leaving I realized that we had waited so long that 3 couples had already been seated, eaten, paid and left at the same table next to us all in the time it took us to order an appetizer and a meal for 2.   If it wasn't for the great food I may have given less stars. I most likely will be back, but to the new location in Mesa. Driving 30 miles for dinner to wait that long is not ideal.",

The drinks a very delicious and there is a pretty good selection of mixed drinks, some wine and a small selection of local, I believe rotating beers. I had a Old Fashioned which was very good, not the best I have ever had but I'm pretty picky. Also a Mile High which was interesting but not sure if I would order again.  Make sure to come with an appetite as with most BBQ places it is going to be a good amount of food.   The CORN SIDE WAS DELICIOUS!!!   The rest was very good, I had a steak and some grilled veggies. Delicious.  The group I was with loved their meals as well and very little was left on the plates.   All in all great place! Give it a try!",

I've never had a problem in all of my visits here.   -The Service My first time at Bobby Q, the Server greeted us (My Girlfriend and I) with an awesome attitude. She explained that their signature ribs are smoked for 22 hours, and a brief history about the company. There's usually a Manager circling around to make sure everyone is satisfied.  -The Food My Girlfriend and I always order the 2 Rib Combo, I get the St. Louis Style, She gets the Baby Back. Believe me when I say, the meat literally and I mean literally falls off the bone with no effort at all! The sauce tastes amazing and they're not stingy with it. One of the highlights is the cornbread. Now, if you know me at all, I used to hate cornbread. But Bobby Q has changed my mind. The cornbread is very tasty and you can actually taste the real corn.  -Atmosphere Kinda gives you a feel of an indoor picnic. They have unique seating. I personally like seating in the booths facing the TVs at the Bar. They usually have sports games on (NFL, MLB, NBA etc...) I believe at a certain time, it changes into a Night Club, which I have yet to try. I haven't tried their drinks yet, but I'm looking forward to it.  I would recommend Bobby Q to anyone I know. No matter how busy they are, they make sure their customers are happy. And they do get pretty busy. That's expected with the amazing food and service they have. Kudos to the Owner and Managers. And thank you to the wonderful staff! I'll definitely be back! - Gabriel Salazar",

    "text": "I came here because it was on Yelp's 100 reviewed restaurants in USA. I feel this place does not deserve the hype it receives and the food comes off as glorified food truck distributor food.   I was pretty hungry being on the plane all day, so I figured I would order a ton of food. For starters, I ordered the Q Rolls and Cajun Shrimp. Of course I had to try their cornbread they give out for free. I went with two orders of the three meat combo which includes pulled pork, brisket, ribs, sausage, and chicken. The Q Rolls are definitely the few highlights of the meal. They were meaty, greasy, and a satisfying crunch on the outside. The queso dip that comes with it makes it even better. The cajun shrimp were Ok, but Im a dummy thinking arizona is going to have good shrimp. The cornbread was really moist. I was only going to have one bite, but ended up having half of the entire piece. Now for the meats. Dont get me wrong as I highly critisize the meal. This is much better than Rudy's or Dickey's (gross). But I was expecting something on the same line as Lockhart, TX (which I foolishly continue to expect when going to so claimed 'amazing' barbecue joints.) THe ribs were fall of the bone (not my favorite style, although some people like that). The pulled pork was soggy. The brisket had some good points, but the bark was soggy (they probably use foil to speed up the cooking process). The sausage was OK, but nothing special. It certainly could have been spicier. The chicken totally took me by surprise. It was moist, tender, and had a nice smoke to it. Normally I wouldnt order chicken over the usual trinity, but they do a good job. All the meats had this sweet taste to it, and didnt have much of a strong smoke flavor (besides the chicken). The BBQ sauce on the table just added to the sweetness.   The sides were all crap, expect the mac and cheese. That was actually pretty good. Everything else lacks any real flavor or craft. For dessert, they gave us some in house donuts. I like the idea of this, but they are arent that spectacular. My friend wanted coffee, even after the waiter said it as horrible. It was probably the most watery coffee Id ever tasted. I know coffee is not something someone should order at a BBQ joint, but at least you know ahead of time.  I imagine people who think this place is amazing either eat bbq from dickeys or have never visited Texas. Either way, I wouldnt come back here again on my own time and would advise anyone you can to go to Little Miss BBQ instead. Thats how BBQ should be.",

THE MAC N CHEESE IS AWESOME!!  (I know there's Velveeta in there!)  It isn't some food-servicey lumpy, watery crap.  So creamy and just melted in my mouth.

All the sides I've tried are tasty, the Mac and cheese is out of this world. They start with fresh cornbread that is also amazing. I grew up hating cornbread, but somehow decided to try it here, and now I'm hooked! The fresh mini donut things at the end of your meal are great too. It's great for lunch or dinner. I haven't been to their night club but I have eaten in the restaurant while the club was open. The club has a dress code which I did not meet, but I figured it didn't matter since I wanted eat. The bouncer gave me a funny look when I approached, obviously I can't wear jeans here! But then I explained that we just wanted to dine in the restaurant and he was more than happy to let us in. They also have a full bar, some good craft local beers on tap and decent cocktails. The atmosphere is really cool, inside and out in the outdoor seating area. You can't go wrong with this pace!",

    "text": "I tried Bobby Q's on the reccomendation of Yelp.  You guys know your stuff and I do trust Yelp when it comes to searching out new places.  As I've said before, I am no bbq afficianado, I just know what I like.  It was a weeknight when we went so it was not super busy.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  I noted that there was a large bar area and thought that this place was probably a hoppin joint on a Friday or Saturday night.    Our server was very pleasant and helpful.  I asked what she liked on the menu and she told me her favorite was the brisket but she recommended I try a combo.  I got brisket and ribs.  I started wih a salad which was tasty and fresh.  My meal arrived shortly after and our server was correct, the brisket was so tender it just melted in my mouth.  It had a nice flavor.  Now, on to the ribs....yet again, melt in your mouth, tender and flavorful.  My daughter was happy as a clam with her chicken strips.  So, why only three stars?  Well, I don't usually disclose things like this but about an hour after we got home, I made several trips to the comode.  I never have issues when I eat, ever.  Something did not sit right with me or something was not good.  Was it the salad?  Don't really know but it lasted for two days.   Suffice it to say that, if that happend to you, would you be leary to give a stellar review and go back soon after?    Bobby Q's has a nice atmosphere, cozy and warm.  I loved the music that was playing......blues and old soul.  The service was great too.  The other issue that I had was the location.  If I did not have a GPS, I never would have found the place.  It's set back off the road and the signage is very small.    Maybe I'll give it another try in a year or so.....when the two days on the comode is a faint memory.",

Lindsay was our server and she was fantastic. So incredibly good, anytime I am in Phoenix I will def go to Bobby Q's. I am not leaving for a few days and intend on eating there one more time before I leave. Yum!! We also got 10% off our bill for saying yelp!!

We went on a weeknight, and, True to my review, I went whole hog, (no pun intended), and ordered a 2 Meat Barbecue Combo plate - the sausage link, and beef brisket. My boyfriend, ever steady, ordered the Prime Rib.   Now, I don't really eat red meat. I mention this in a lot of reviews, and that mention is usually followed by \"...but this time, I did, and I loved it.\" So, I guess I do actually eat red meat now. Wacky. Thanks, Yelp, for contributing to the decay of my health and the fatty deposits inside my arteries. Do you even get fatty deposits in your arteries? Don't mind me, I'm just flaunting my lack of basic anatomical knowledge on the internet. Anyway, the beef brisket was awesome, and the sausage link was truly one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. Really! I loved it. Tasty and smokey and sweetly tinged with barbecue sauce. The corn and the shoestring fries are still hanging out in the \"delicious\" zone, and my boyfriend once again wolfed down his prime rib like a champ. He also tossed out a compliment to his side of macaroni and cheese, saying that it was \"really good.\" From him, that is a ringing endorsement.  Our server was sweet and efficient, and not at all obnoxious. A+, Sawyer! You were great.  The little bag of Thank-Q doughnuts was adorable...we didn't get those on our first visit, and, even though we were completely stuffed, we appreciated the gesture and somehow found the digestive strength to scarf them down on the way home.  Thanks for a wonderful night, Jason. Your customer service is out of this world.",

For dinner my wife ordered the 12oz steak with mashed potatoes and Mac n' cheese. The steak was cooked EXACTLY how she likes just the right amount of pink, juicy, and melt in your mouth amazing. The mashed potatoes were seasoned to perfection and she couldn't get enough of the Mac n cheese. I ordered the half rack of ribs and fries however when they brought our food they had accidentally brought out a crusted cod. I politely voiced the mistake and our server handled everything professionally and immediately corrected the order and even let us keep the cod and brought my ribs out. The ribs...I cannot stress how perfect my ribs were. I consider myself a rib lover. I order ribs at almost every restaurant that serves them and these ribs were hands down best ribs Iv ever had in my life! The meat would literally fall off the bone when you picked it up. The perfect amount of fat, no chewy parts at all, and the BBQ sauce was smothered all over. The meat just melted in your mouth. After dinner the manager came out to make sure we were taken care of and gave us free dessert for the mistake that was made. At no point in time was I disappointed in the service. Everything was spot on. This place is my new favorite place to eat in all of phoenix! I will most definitely be back again and again and again!",

This place is actually a lot hipper and nicer than the...umm....kinda crap neighborhood would make you think it would be...the entrance is not really well marked, we thought they were closed because we couldn't get in!!  We could be dumb though... The brisket rolls were deep fried goodness, nothing wrong with that.  Chicken/rib combo was solid very moist, though I would have appreciated more smoke flavor.  And the spare ribs had that gristly-mini-bones-fatty-section action (though not unusual for untrimmed spare ribs)  The sauce and the sides (mashed potato and mac-n-cheese) were good and the portions are absolutely ENORMOUS!  I'm still eating their Q!!",

With a name so simple yet perplexing, it must either be the greatest or worst barbecue to have ever existed in this Quadrant. Like a gift from a god, their smoked ribs and brisket are tender to the touch and have the tendency to fall onto the table before reaching your plate. Such tragedy. Minus 1. Their sauce oomph is somewhat mild along with its sweetness and to me that is a blessing. Being a victim of the great-bbq-but-bad-sides or the so-so-bbq-but-good-sides, Bobby Q has made a believer in me that there is a higher power out there that watches over us and to those that do great things, rewards us.

We went at about 6pm on a Sunday and were shocked by the Awesome Happy Hour Deals they had!!! $3 beer specials, $3 Fireball Shots, $0.99/6 wings, and they had a grill set up in the outdoor lounge area where they were serving up $1 Burgers, Dogs, Steak Tacos!  Our server Amethyst was great! So attentive, made sure we were never thirsty. My dad had a Bacon Wrapped Hot Dog and loved it! I went for the Steak Tacos that were hot off the grill and amazing. Seriously the best steak taco I have had in Phoenix! Simple and delicious made with great steak! Fresh toppings bar set up next to the grill. My Mom went for the BBQ Wings, and of course I stole a couple from her!  I can't speak for their Full Restaurant Menu packed with Meat Goodies, but after our great experience here we will for sure go back!  I personally can't wait to try the Smoked Prime Rib! I have never seen that done before, it has to be amazing!  Great job! Thanks for the awesome service Amethyst! I wish I had asked about your schedule as I'd like to go back when you're working!",

Dessert was apple cobbler, which was also well done. Overall, a good experience. Portions are ample, but so are the prices. Dinner for two with drinks and tip was $85.",

    "text": "After a Sunday afternoon of sun and fun at a Spring Training game, my friend and I were kind-of, sort-of, well not really anywhere near Bobby Q.  OK, we were west of the 17 freeway, so I suppose that counts as \"near\".  In any event, since missing out on the UYE the previous week, I was happy to visit this new-to-me BBQ spot for a very late lunch/early dinner.  We were seated immediately, and started off with a couple of Blue Moons while perusing the menu.  It was extensive, with almost any type of BBQ combination you can imagine.  I did not take the time to review it all, because I only had eyes for one thing.  Brisket.  To sandwich, or not to sandwich, that was the only question.  We ended up selecting two BBQ platters - one with smoked BBQ brisket and the other with smoked pulled pork.  Each came with two sides - we chose mac n cheese, pecan cole slaw and potato salad.  Hey, wait, that is only three sides.  That is because we got two, count 'em TWO orders of mac & cheese.  Enable my bad habits!  Look!  Corn bread!  Warm, moist and topped with a healthy ball of butter.  It was probably a good thing we were only given two pieces.  I could have eaten a LOT of that...  Our meals arrived quickly, along with a carafe of spicy BBQ sauce (that went very well on the mac n cheese, I might add).  While the portion sizes weren't huge, they were still impressive.  It was immediately obvious that my friend liked my brisket better than the pulled pork.  How did I know this?  1) because it was OhSoVery good and 2) It was quickly disappearing from my plate without any effort from me!  Of the sides, of course I liked the mac n cheese the most - while it was not the oh so decadent Fleming's version, or the gooey cheesy version from Scottsdale BBQ, it still hit the spot.    * We did make one strategic error.  While writing this review I noticed the Yelp Review Discount offer of 10% off the bill.  Too late to help us - but not too late to help you!  Go, eat, and ask for your discount!",

    "text": "WOW, DELICIOUS!!! First I would like to compliment the host and our server Autumn, they were very polite and helpful and service was very attentive and in a timely manner. The wife and I decided to have lunch before our long drive home back to SO-CAL, she spotted the restaurant sign from the freeway and liked the clever lil Bobby Q name. So I yelped it and saw good reviews, so we gave it a try. The restaurant is not hard to find, it has nice size parking lot with lots of trees and shade. When you step out of the car you instantly get hit with the delicious smell of smoking BBQ! The building has that roadhouse feeling but a more family atmosphere,  the inside is very nice and clean, dim lit and once again very nice atmosphere.  I ordered my favorite BBQ dish, the pulled pork sandwich w/ mac n cheese as my side with a lemonade.  The wife had the beef brisket and the BBQ chicken with the pecan coleslaw and mashed potatoes as her side. While we waited for our meals they brought us some delicious corn bread that must have been freshly made, it was warm and sweet. So moist you could cut it with your fork and eat it like a pastry, leaving you wanting more after the last bite. Our food came shortly after we finished the cornbread so it had to be between 5-10mins from when we gave Autumn our orders. The smell was devine and the food presentation was very nice, not like your typical BBQ joints, it seemed a lil more fine dining, the quantities are more controlled , not just slapped on the plate in mass amounts. I first dipped into the mac n cheese and I'll tell you I could have stopped right there and not have tasted another thing and I would have left a happy customer, best mac n cheese I've ever had!!! Next I took a bite of my pulled pork sandwich and it did not disappoint. The bun it was served on was fresh and warm, the pork was succulent and smokey,  sauce was sweet and tangy which complimented the smoked pork.  The wife and i sampled eachothers food and every single bite was fresh, succulent, savory and absolutely delicious.  Hands down the best BBQ I have ever eaten!!! The only thing I can complain about is we don't have a Bobby Q's over here where I live in Diamond bar, California. P.S.  My wife says, she thinks there should be a Barbie Q in California, we will have to make Phoenix a regular trip until then though.",

We ordered appetizers- the rolled ones with BRISKET in them!  Perfect with a cold Blue Moon beer.  Finally, got a table and a cool waiter who brought us warm cornbread- great start!  We ordered baby back ribs, catfish, fried chicken with baked potato, coleslaw (with pecans!) and, my favorite, the creamy mac & cheese.  Fantastic find.  Only wish we'd had room for the cobbler of the day!",

The ribs are fall-of-the-bone moist, but almost entirely lacking in flavor save for whatever sauce you slather them in. No smokiness, no meatiness, just sauce.   The mac-and-cheese is average, not good, not bad, and the coleslaw is mayo based, which I hate. Fortunately it's priced right, heck, it's downright cheap for decent BBQ, and our server was awesome.   Not a bad BBQ spot by any stretch of the imagination.",

Food - The Sunday family feast included 1/2 St. Louis ribs, 1/2 pound of brisket, 1/2 pound of pork and 1/2 of a chicken +2 sides and cornbread! All for $20 a person.  Things that REALLY stood out: 1) Q rolls were perfectly crispy rolls of yummy brisket! 2) Cornbread was unlike any other cornbread I've had 3) Chicken wasn't dry at all and had really good flavor!",

The service was great, the waiters were friendly, thoughtful and very knowledgeable, and really went the extra mile in providing my large group with great customer service.   The food was spectacular, made to order, served hot, and good portions. The ambiance was good as well, exhibiting warmth within a family-friendly atmosphere.   The only downside to our experience was that we live in California, so we could only visit Bobby Q's when we travel to AZ.

    "text": "Great cornbread. Everyone's reviews about the q rolls were spot on. Those were great. The sauce that comes with was great too. I ordered the country fried chicken. I'm going to be honest, I only ate about a quarter of it. The portion I tried tasted decent, just not much flavor to the gravy or breading. When I would try to break a piece off with my fork the breading was just falling off. It wouldn't stay on the chicken what so ever. It was a full chicken breast and was a bit chewy. Fully cooked but maybe over cooked or frozen? I'm truly not sure. The batter had more of a fish fry consistency then a country fried consistency in my opinion. Fiance agreed something was off about the chicken. On the side I got roasted corn. To die for. Absouletly delicious and the mashed potatoes were good as well. My fiance ordered a pulled pork sandwhich. I tried it and it was delicious. I wish I ordered that instead. Her mac n cheese was great too. I would have told the server about the my food not being up to par but she was doing a very good job and all the other food was great.  I had a beer and it was a nice and cold. Fiance ordered the qlada. Had a good amount of alcohol. These drinks are huge, I'm serious. Also the donuts they bring with the check are great!  Overall we will be back for more. Im going to stay away from the country fried chicken though",

It was so good I ate two of them straight out of the fridge the next morning for breakfast. The side dishes are awesome, especially the mac and cheese and roasted corn. The barbecue is juicy and flavorful. I didn't even add barbecue sauce to my meat because it was just fine without it. You can even finish off your meal with free, yes FREE, donuts.

The outside bar area patio seating was soaked because of leaking misters. And inside the bar was insanely loud.  Food was good. I had the roasted chicken and I wouldn't order it again...I'd try something else. It wasn't cold, but it wasn't fresh off the grill hot either. Baked potato was delicious, and roasted veggies were great. Corn bread was great. The food definitely tasted home-cooked. Not too greasy, and not too fatty. My meal was $13, almost the cheapest main course option. Nor sure it's worth the price.  I would have only given Bobby Q's 2 stars, but the servers were awesome - they were attentive and fast, and they gave our table an extra bag of mini-donuts for free. I give an extra star for that.  If I'm not paying, I'll gladly visit Bobby Q's again one day.",

    "text": "BOBBY Q's - I never knew how much I loved BBQ until I ate here. Now I will crave it.  Ended up here for a friend's birthday. The restaurant is big and airy and laid out well. They can pack them in but not like sardines. The tables are nicely spaced out and for such a big place, it has charm and is comfortable. The hostess desk rocks - friendly and efficient. We had a reservation for 7pm on a Wednesday, in the summer. I can only imagine how busy it gets on a weekend in prime season...so plan ahead and make a reservation. And GPS how to get there, if you've never been or are new to the valley. Running on the frontage road near I-17, it's easy to end up on a wrong street. Then again, once you've been here once, you'll never forget how to get back. Follow your gut instincts...   The prime rib looked so delicious that I had to order it (great prime rib is harder to find than you'd think). But everything I tasted was out of this world:  House Salad (I love this kind of classic salad! For a perfect dressing - combine the dijon and herb vinaigrettes)  Corn bread (ask for honey with the butter) Prime Rib (medium rare, naturally) Brisket Mac and Cheese BBQ pulled chicken (I have never liked BBQ chicken before eating Bobby Q's - DELISH!)  It was a taste bud bonanza.  **They were out of the Mississippi mud pie (which I am such a fan that not getting to sample theirs could plummet a rating but everything was too good for anything other than 5 stars). So we sampled the cobbler - yum.  The service was friendly, cheerful, competent and pretty much perfect.  **I will mention that as a group of adults, our meal came a little quicker than was ideal. But Bobby Q's is popular for a reason and the service is so competent that knowing that, I will just order a little slower/staggered, when I return with adult friends.   Families with kids - you will not have any problem feeding your kids in a timely manner. I imagine the service is perfectly paced for families.  And as if all that isn't wonderful enough, they give you a bag of the best cinnamon dusted mini donuts to take with you!!!  They are as good of donuts as Cafe du Monde serves beignets. Only problem, I couldn't eat another bite.  So diners - here's my final tip - store the bag of donuts in your fridge, overnight and then reheat in the microwave (still in the paper bag) for 30 seconds. Have with your morning coffee. You're welcome.  Bobby Q does everything so well that I can not wait to go back. I'll starve myself for a day or two, before I do. Go hungry. It's amazing.",

Even after I ate the burnt end my mouth was watering for more. The mac & cheese was extremely creamy and delicious. The mash potatoes were also extremely creamy and delicious. It's very rare that I like mash potatoes without gravy but this was amazing! There wasn't even bacon bits on the mash potatoes and it was still delicious! Pulled pork was so soft it almost had the consistency of the mash potatoes. Ribs fell off the bones and were delicious. Fried chicken fillet was very crispy and juicy and was covered is delicious gravy. The only thing that wasn't for me was the BBQ chicken. The Sunday family feast could feed more like 2 normal people. The free mini doughnuts at the end were hot, fresh, and delicious as they fall apart between your fingers as you pick up the super fresh sucker that was fried probably 10 seconds before it got to you. Simply put, food here is amazing and was worth the $40 taxi ride there from the JW Marriott Dessert Ridge and the $40 taxi ride back.   _____  Overall Experience 5/5 Stars   _____  Last Words BEST BBQ I'VE EVER HAD!",

Start off with the onion block and then enjoy some cornbread as well prior to your entree. The portions are large and the side dishes (2) come with each entree. So be careful how much you order- maybe one entree and some apps. Sit inside or outside and use Open Table for no waiting!   A win win for all the family!!!",

    "text": "I had to really think about this place for it's review. This was my first time visiting this place after smelling the BBQ every time I pass it on the freeway. I was so excited to try the food so I checked out there menu online and notice that it was expensive but within reason for bbq. A friend and I arrived at the place, got the menus and I notice the prices were more then the online price. Anyway I ordered the brisket sandwich and mashed potatoes and my friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and Mac and cheese.  We also order there Q Rolls which is brisket wrapped in flour tortillas and deep fried.  The Q Rolls were good, they gave us 6 rolls that were about 3 inches long $12, my brisket sandwich $14 with one side had more bread then meat. I was very disappointed in the serving size for the price. Not even a 1/2 pound of brisket. They gave me more mashed potatoes then sandwich.  As for the taste, it was ok. No real flavor on the brisket and the spicy bbq sauce was not even spicy and was too sweet. I wished I've taken a picture of my food but it wasn't even photo worthy.  Our total bill for the Q Rolls, brisket sandwich, pulled pork sandwich with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes came out to be $47. I would not recommend this place if your looking for bang for your buck and awesome bbq. This place was just ok. I won't be back.",

    "text": "I'm getting pretty close to not setting foot in here again.  Here's why: As a regular, I not only go there for the food, but because of the people.  I have known these servers and bartenders for years, right up until they get shopped and fired.  That's right folks, my meals are usually almost ALWAYS ruined by some idiot shopping a beloved server or bartender of mine and I have to sit there and listen to Joe Shmo ask moronic questions like (no joke) \"can my daughter have a beer?  She's sixteen....what's the legal age to consume alcohol?\"  Now as a former secret shopper myself for a LARGE company, here's a few words of advice, train your shoppers, a want ad in the newspaper is ridiculous.  If you care THAT much about customer service, let your customers be your shoppers, because I can spot these idiots when they walk in, and most of them LOVE the idea of judging a young person and making them sweat for their job.  Shame on you.  Secondly as a loyal customer, the way I was treated by your shoddy excuse of management when having an allergic reaction to peanuts in your dessert was appalling.  Here's my assessment as a former shopper:  1.) When I asked the wait staff if the chocolate dessert had peanuts in it, they seemed sure it did not, but nobody could be sure because it wasn't printed on the menu.  Upon having two bites of the dessert my mouth immediately swelled up and I had an allergic reaction.  Ciara and Toni were very concerned and attentive, offering water and even a concoction to help me purge the food if needed.  They both kept a watchful eye on me while making sure to not neglect other patrons. 2.) I asked to speak to a manager to merely suggest for the second time (this happened before with their banana dessert) that as an establishment, they should protect themselves by listing peanut ingredients on the menu.  The manager replied that usually when someone has an allergy they tell the server and then the server tells the kitchen, thus making me the customer feel like it was a failure on my part to notify and announce my allergy to the entire restaurant upon my arrival.  Sitting there astounded, I asked if I was indeed hearing what I was hearing, and she glossed over it, thanked me for the feedback, said they were going to reprint their menus at some point, offered to call \"someone\"I'm assuming an ambulance, and pat me on the back and left.  Really?  So here's the deal, the food is good, the servers and bartenders are the best.  Pretty much everyday they work in fear of losing their job, and I can't support that.  They remember what you drink, how you like your food prepared, your name, and that's not something you get in chain restaurants, but the regulars, the ones who you could count on to support the place, they've slowly disappeared, and I'm headed that way myself.  Unless you've been sitting at your spot, enjoying your meal only to have it RUINED by some jerk shopping your friend and one of many favorite bartenders or servers, you don't know what sick is.  Getting a job in today's economy is difficult enough, but these people treat the mostly 20 something employees like slave  workers who are fortunate to be breathing the bobby q air.  I can't fathom going in to work everyday wondering if it's my last.  Finally, when a regular has a concern like PUT PEANUTS ON YOUR MENU, it's not just for the patrons benefit, but your own, and you failed to see that, instead you shrugged me off and couldn't get out of my presence fast enough; I know when I'm being patronized, don't forget, I can shop you too, and you failed big time, as in you'd be fired.  Good customer service is what Pita Jungle did where they asked me for my phone number or email address to discuss further (turned out to be pine nuts that were most likely cross contaminated).  So in conclusion, when you look around and wonder where all the regular money was that you could always count on coming in every dY at the same time, it's probably at the Black Angus, one of your former regulars is now a regular there, people can go there and grab some food and a drink or two without witnessing the torture you inflict on you're employees.  Shame on you.",

    "text": "I went here with a large group for a friend's birthday. This place is great for large groups! The atmosphere is casual with slightly higher-than-normal ambient noise/sound level. Dishes are large and can be shared.   Cornbread is served prior to appetizers and entries are brought out. The bread is fresh baked, but in my opinion, slightly dry. It's okay if you're using butter though. I had the Smoked Sliced Beef Brisket with Mac & Cheese and Shoestring Fries for my two side dishes. The brisket was probably one of the best I've ever had. Piping hot, super juicy, and tender (fell apart on my fork as I was picking it up)... With just enough sauce so that the meat wasn't swimming. I liked how they served both mild and hot bbq sauces on the side so you could have more sauce as needed and to the spice level you prefer. The Mac & Cheese was very creamy, but nothing extraordinary. It felt very heavy. The shoestring fries were your typical thinly cut fries that are crunchy, but could use a little more salt. Towards the end of the meal, \"donuts\" are given in brown lunch sacks. They resembled beignets in the shape of donut holes. These donuts were very sweet and oily, but had a nice crunchy outside and soft inside.  Over all, I was most excited about the brisket (next time I come back I'll definitely reorder this dish). The donuts were a nice surprise, but overly oily for my tastes. I would recommend a reservation, since when I went the restaurant seemed quite busy. Not too shabby for a bbq joint in the southwest!",

I highly suggest making a reservation because it can get busy in there. I've gone with friends and we share the \"Whole Hog Heaven\" which gives you the opportunity to try 4 different meats on their menu plus 3 sides. But the best part is defitnitely their bbq sauce so make sure to ask for extra because they will gladly give it to you! Their roasted corn is my favorite side dish and the mac and cheese is really good too.   Also, try the Q-rolls as a starter. The chipotle dip is delicious! And make sure to get an order of the cornbread too..you won't regret it!",

Both were very tender and tasty. The third member had the baby back ribs and was not very impressed. We ordered a mix of sides so we could taste several. The baked potato and roasted corn were also nothing impressive. The pecan cole slaw is just slaw with pecan bits on top. Nice flavor. The grilled veg was a nice mix and grilled till tender. The mashed potatoes and mac & cheese were yummy! One of us had the Bobby-Q amber ale. It was very good and served in a very frosty glass. Desserts were good but not outstanding. All in all, a nice place to eat with good food for typical prices. Would definitely go back again and try something else.",

The building and atmosphere was True to the BBQ tradition.  SUNDAYS at Bobby Q!!  $28 got us a family feast of Smoked Chicken, Smoked Brisket, Smoked Ribs(St. Louis style), Smoked Pulled Pork, 2 sides (We chose Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes), Cornbread.  The cornbread was slightly sweet, buttery and very moist!  All the meat was very tender.. but I am partial to brisket which really impressed me the most...  My boyfriend loves ribs and said on the ride home that they are better than his favorite.  The spicy BBQ sauce was a little too tangy for me and needed more kick.  The server Jon was very informative about the menu and knowledgable about BBQ.   We left very full and happy with alot of food to take home!  It was worth the drive across town!",

I'm kind of spoiled with good BBQ and a bit of a snob because where I'm from, Texas, BBQ is a religion; much like chili and football.  But alas!  I have found BBQ, very good BBQ here in AZ, at Bobby Q's.  We ordered a platter of beef ribs, brisket and pulled pork.  It was properly 'Texas' sized too!  I can't even tell you how tender the beef was because my description will not justify it.  I will tell you, the VERY thick, juicy and tasty meat literally fell off the VERY large bone when simply picked up from the plate.  The pulled pork was just as good but that's not hard to mess up.  The real BBQ gauge for me was in the brisket.   And again, I must confess, no description of mine will get even remotely close to how heavenly it truly was.  It far exceeded my expectation and I'll just say, the bar I set was very high!  So, I'm a fan of this BBQ as long as it stays as is, where is.  I'll close by saying the mac-n-cheese rocked and my incredible dinner finale of peach cobbler would have made my Granny proud!   This is truly a \"don't miss\" eatery!",

I can tell you, we were not disappointed. The portions were huge (enough for lunch tomorrow) and our waiter, Alonso, was incredibly knowledgeable about not just the food but the history of Bobby-Q as well. When we first saw the prices, they seemed a little steep, but after we saw how much food we got, it was perfect. And, at the end, we got a bag of donuts that are made fresh in-house, and WOW, they were reminiscent of a delicious churro! Overall, it was really superb, and we will definitely be coming back AND recommending it to our friends!",

My wife preferred the Baby Back Ribs over the Beef Ribs, but they were both excellent.    Since we were celebrating a birthday, our waitress brought us a desert.

I wish I could remember the waiters name the first time I went because he was amazing. This last time we went our waiters name was Austin, he was just as amazing as our first waiter. Austin seemed to just go out of his way to ensure our dining experience was top notch. Not only did Austin make sure we were taken care of but so did the runners and the manager Whose name is Jack. I digress a bit raving about the wait staff, it's just I can't remember a time that I have had such service at this high of caliber. Austin and Jack as well as the rest, you guys rock!!! Now on to the food. We had the ribs, my wife had the beef ribs and I had the pork ribs. We both had the wedge salad. This was some of the best bbq I have had. My wife loved it and raves about it as well. The meat was so tender it practically fell off the bone. The sauces were so tasty and I was able to try different ones. Whenever we go down to Phoenix from Prescott Valley we want to make Bobby Qs a stop along the way. It's just to good to pass up.",

Those suggestions don't affect the rating I gave 'cause the food was just too good! As for the service, our waitress was fast friendly and very informative!

Often times restaurants will use the crumbs or shavings for their sandwiches. My food was good but the 4 slices of beef were very very thin. I estimate it to have been a quarter of a pound of meat. For $21 I would think the portions would be a bit more. Brisket is better when cut greater than 1/4 inch. So this is why I am not giving it 5 Stars. The Mac and cheese was very good as well as the beans and corn bread.",

Ribs were tender and moist, and the brisket was fall-apart good.  My only complaint would be the sweetness of the BBQ sauce, but then they provide you with a spicy option at your table when the food comes out, so problem solved!  Bonus, when you check in on Yelp you get a 10% discount off your bill.  And props to our server Emmy, who did a great job dealing with 6 wise-ass baseball fans and kept our whole meal running smoothly.

At Bobby Q's, its more formal; there's a nice ambience, there's a full bar, and you eat with forks and knives.   The Pros: The great service The 10% off by checking in on yelp - yay! The complimentary cinnimon sugar donuts at the end which are HOME MADE - dayum, those things were awesome The pineapple drink - its a real pineapple filled with a ton of alcohol but guess what? It tastes like juice...which means its dangerous. Drink at your caution.  Cons Their sides could be better - The mac and cheese was way too thick and unfortunately, didn't match the rave reviews.   Another interesting fact - there's a club next door so you can get your grub and then dance it off",

I prefer ribs that still cling to the bone, but can be pulled off easily as well. To each their own. were amazing and the portions are ridiculously small .

Most places smother meats in crappy bbq sauce but they were really light on it and I got to enjoy the meat. I had the brisket and pulled pork. I have to say the brisket was hands done great!! The beans weren't anything special personally. But the corn was good as was the mac and chz and dear god how could I forget!!?? The corn bread! I'm super picky on corn bread but it was awesome! No honey needed! Def a cute set up as well. The little booths around the bar was great. And they have a dance floor at night on the weekends. Awesome place! Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Here in Cali, we call it barbecue, or BBQ! In Arizona, they call it Bobby Q.  Well, maybe not all Arizonians call it that, but a good number of them do. When I reached out to some AZ Yelpers to find out where I can find some serious BBQ in Phoenix, almost every person mentioned Bobby's name.   Bobby Q is a huge place that looks more like an upscale steakhouse rather than a BBQ joint. The inside is dimly lit and has a fancy, upscale decor. They also have two big bars and a banquet room.   Right when our party of four was seated we received some delicious house made cornbread with sweet butter. After devouring the yummy cornbread we ordered two appetizers, their Q-Rolls and their Fire Pie Pizza topped with beef brisket. The Q-Rolls were similar to those pigs in a blanket everyone loves as a child.  Instead of mini hot dogs, Bobby stuffs the little flaky pastries with juicy beef brisket. The Q-Rolls were incredible alone but when dipped in the chipotle sauce that comes with the app, it gave the rolls an even more fabulous taste.  The beef brisket pizza was good but not great. They put lots of cheese on the pizza but not enough Bobby Q sauce or beef brisket.   For dinner I ordered their three meat combo with pulled pork, beef brisket and St. Louis spare ribs. My fiance ordered the Prime Rib with Chimichuri shrimp dinner. My dinner was big enough to feed at least two people. Every meat was phenomenal. The pulled pork and beef brisket were both juicy, tender and incredibly flavorful. The St. Louis spare ribs were falling-off- the-bone tender and had a nice smoky flavor. My girls Prime Rib was also really good but her shrimp were burnt, rubbery, and had almost no Chimichuri sauce on them, which upset her a little bit. Once your dinners are brought to your table, they also bring out two big containers filled with warm sweet Bobby Q sauce and spicy Bobby Q sauce. Both of these Bobby Q sauces were great but since I'm a huge fan of spicy I preferred the spicy sauce over the sweet one. My dinner came with three sides while my girls came with two. These are the sides we got. Mac and cheese (we both got this)  Pecan Coleslaw Loaded Baked Potato Roasted Corn All of these sides were great but my favorite of the bunch was the Mac and Cheese. I don't remember what my other dinner companions ordered but I do remember they all said they loved what they had. To wash down all this great Bobby Q, we all had huge glasses of their house made sweet tea, which was super sweet and delicious.  Even though everyone was full, we all decided to share a slice of their Sub Zero Banana Cream Pie for dessert. This pie was served ice cold and was more like a piece of banana cheese cake than a regular banana cream pie. This pie had an amazing banana flavor and was topped with lots of caramel sauce. To our surprise, after we finished the pie, our server brought us some home made complimentary cinnamon sugar donuts. These little things were wonderful, I just wish I would have been a little less full so I could have enjoyed them more.   The service and prices here were both great. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. Since it was our first time there he really helped us out by making suggestions and telling us what their most popular dishes are. The prices were very reasonable seeing that you get so much food.    If your a fan of BBQ then I guarantee you will be a fan of Bobby Q. If you ever visit Phoenix you have to check this place out.",

    "text": "Looking for some good BBQ?  You won't be disappointed with Bobby Q's.  As soon as we were seated, our server came over with a friendly greeting and a basket of warm cornbread.  She recommended the Q Rolls which are flour tortillas stuffed with smoked brisket and deep fried.  5 rolls per order - served with chipotle ranch dressing and bbq sauce.  The perfect combination, moist brisket inside a crispy tortilla shell.  Hubby prefers the St. Louis ribs and I had the baby back ribs.  The ribs had a nice smokey flavor and the meat practically fell off the bone.  Each bite was a a mouthful of heaven.  We chose the mac and cheese and the pecan salad as our sides,  The mac and cheese was nice and creamy.  The pecan cole slaw was okay.  Basically coleslaw sprinkled with chopped pecans.  Service was great!  Our server was very attentive.  Although we didn't have room for dessert, our server brought us a little bag of donuts to take with us.  YUM...what more is there to say?!?  Too busy licking the sauce off the fingers.",

As tender as the ribs are, they still don't have that great smoky bbq taste within the meat that makes bbq REAL bbq.  We got the hog heaven meal so we had the baby back ribs, st louis, pulled pork and chicken with the potato salad and pecan slaw sides.  THe pecan cole slaw was good.   Roasted corn side was not quite what I expected as I thought it was just that.  It was roasted some but was more like small slivers of corn on the cob on top of a bunch of corn kernals.  But the sauce was tasty - probably pure butter. We also got the fish fry special.  The fish I have to say was done pretty well.  It was a crispy batter so it wasn't overly soggy with oil.  The fish (cod) was pretty fresh tasting. This time the cornbread wasn't as soft which I liked better. Tried their banana pudding dessert.  It was different than what I was expecting.  The pudding was a lot thicker than I would have liked but still tasty.  The crust though was yummy.  It was a walnut-like crumble.  Very similar tasting to the inside of baklava. Still have yet to try their peach cobbler.  Will next time.",

I would roll around naked in their cornbread and ask to be buried with the mac & cheese. The meat preparation of the ribs and the pulled pork was really nice. However. The sauce sucks. Both the regular and the spicy are thin and lack flavor. You can taste the ketchup in the sauce and little else. The onion brick was cold and greasy and the shoestring fries were limp and flavorless. This is the first time my husband has been to a bbq place and not basically licked his plate clean. He left over half of his brisket sandwich. Unheard of.  The meal was pricey and mediocre. This is far from the best bbq.",

I can't get enough of them, the sauce they are in is sooooooo good. The whole hog, we normally get ribs and double brisket. The brisket is amazing, ribs are delish and even the pulled pork is awesome. We love the cornbread and the 'to go' donuts as well. If you haven't been here before you MUST try.

We split an 8 oz steak & 1/2 rack of ribs. Came with loaded baked & mac n cheese & grilled veggies. Ribs were so good and sauce was perfect. Steak was a tad red but still enjoyed it. Can I get a moment of silence for the mac and cheese??? Get you some. Super creamy & great flavor. Complimentary cornbread was so good...glad I chose this place for my pre birthday dinner.",

It was so good in fact that hubs wants to inquire about holding a private event there for work.  So yeah, not bad at all!  We shared a 3 meat plate with brisket, baby back ribs and pulled pork.  Out of the 3, the brisket was my least favorite because I thought it was a bit dry but hubs didn't seem to think so.  He thought they were all pretty dang good.  My 3 year old devoured his mac and cheese.  It was pretty creamy and delicious.  We ordered the cornbread as an after thought so I was pretty full by the time it got to our table but it was so delicious I ate a whole one plus some.  It tastes almost like a desert because of the sweetness.  Perfection.  The decor is nice - very casual and bbq-like.  Service was good, too.  If you like bbq, you definitely need to check this place out!",

Baby back ribs were good. Sausage and brisket great as well. Cole slaw has nuts on top (weird). It was way too much meat but great quality. Pace yourselves.

I've had my fair share of great BBQ experiences from all four corners of the US, including states and cities traditionally known for this great American dish.  I have to say that what I had at Bobby Q knocked it out of the park.  I had the two-meat combo comprising of baby backs and brisket.  According to my server, these two are \"the ones that keeps the lights on\" for the restaurant.  I totally see why.  Their meals are smoked in house for about a full day.  Combined with their special rubs, not only does this impart a great taste but the meats were some of the most tender and moist I've had.  The brisket was melt in your mouth tender while the pork ribs fell off the bone with little effort.  The BBQ sauce used was just right - not too overpowering the taste of the meat, not too sweet or \"ketchupy\".  Even the sides of broccolini and roasted brussel sprouts were spot on and complimented the entrees well..  I lucked out and came just before Happy Hour was done so I took advantage and ordered a couple of appys.  The buffalo cauliflower was exceptional (gotta try making this at home!) as was the beef brisket tacos.  I have to say that the service was great.  All of the staff, from the hostess, to my server, to the manager, Joanne, were friendly and helpful.   Easily one of the best for BBQ I've had.",

Its basically an off the highway stop for grub. The outdoor eating area looked more appealing than inside. The service was great but i just wasnt crazy about the bbq or drinks unfortunately. We shared the Q rolls and a both ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The Q rolls tasted like they were from Applebees and the pulled pork just wasnt juicy at all.  The mac n cheese was actually pretty good. Portions are pretty large also.   The drinks were 95% mixer. They give you unlimited cornbread which was different than your average. It was a circle of  soft and buttery goodness. They also give you free donuts at the end of your meal. These were the winner for me. THEY WERE SO GOOOOD!   However, the service was great! Our waiter was very attentive and offered if we wanted more cornbread and whatever else we needed.   I unfortunately would not return here again. It just seems like people like it cause its a convenient \"real food\" stop on the highway. Its definitely not the best bbq iv ever had and it is certainty not worth the hype. If i do return,  itll be for those damn donuts!",

For my meal I had the beef brisket sandwich and although our waiter asked if I needed more BBQ sauce I initially said no.  Biting into it I definitely needed it so if you're asked just say YES TO THE SAUCE.   It's so good and more is better anyway. The corn muffin before the meal is so good.   This place was recommended to me by an elderly man I was sitting next to on a flight home. When we got to talking what are plans were in Phoenix upon landing he raved about this place and he was headed here with his wife for dinner.  It was enough info to put it on my to do list and you needed to also. GO!  Get the brisket, or anything on the menu you won't regret.",

    "text": "My little brother and I are on a long road trip from Los Angeles to New Orleans and we had to go past Phoenix. As I was driving my little brother searched up a place to eat and he wanted to try some barbeque.   We opted to try Bobby Q because another place was closed on Monday, and we thought the name + the numerous reviews was appealing.   We made a reservation online for 2pm but when we arrived, it wasn't packed so we were just able to get seated easily for 2. They also have an outdoor patio area where you can sit and enjoy a waterfall, we almost sat there but we decided to let the host sit us wherever was most convenient for them.   We were sat and asked what we wanted to drink by our waiter Chris(topher). He's got his greeting and mantra down, \"Have you been here before?\"  Us: No we're just passing by. Chris: \"Where are you all from?\"  Us: Los Angeles area Chris: \"Very cool, I'm from California, San Bernardino myself!\"  I heard this repeated to other customers who sat down. He's a very personable waiter.   We wanted to try a variety of things so my brother and I opted for the Whole Hog's Variety. It was about $54 but we already dented it. It came with a choice of a variety of different things but we chose: sausage, beef brisket, beef ribs, and St. Louis ribs.  Sausage: I thought it was good but nothing too special. Perhaps I'm just not a fan of sausages done this way, but by no means was it bad.   Beef brisket: This was probably the star of the dish. It was amazingly delicious. It was very juicy and tender and the sauce didn't overpower the meat taste. This is something I highly recommend.  Beef Ribs: I'm a sucker for beef ribs, and these were so good the meat came off the bones easily. The flavor was a little bland but that was perfect, because the sauce provided the needed salt.  St Louis Pork Ribs: They were also really good and they melted off their bones, but the St. Louis pork ribs were too salty. I was only able to eat 2 because I couldn't keep eating it, but the flavors were good.   For the sides we got the: Mac and cheese, corn, and pecan cole slaw.  I originally wanted more vegetables as a side because vegetables help compliment meat, but my little brother wanted the mac and cheese, and the corn. So I chose the cole slaw as a means to cut the richness of the different barbeque meats.   The mac and cheese was very rich, and I couldn't eat too much of it because of how rich both the entree and the side was.   I was also so-so with the corn, but as a disclaimer, I'm very impartial to corn to begin with. To me, unless it's naturally very sweet they're almost wasted calories. This was just a personal preference, but my brother wanted it.  The pecan cole slaw was perfect. If anything I would have liked a little more acidity in it, but it was such a good addition to the meal. After a bite of the rich pork ribs, the cole slaw really helps cleanse the palette. It was very refreshing.   Overall we were very pleased by this restaurant. Our bill came out to be about $39 per person (tax and a hefty tip) but we probably had enough food to last 3 meals.",

    "text": "Went here for a meetup group event.   First off, I would like to say, if I was grading the cornbread, the mac and cheese and the mashed potato sides, I would give them a resounding five stars.   The service, I would give five stars as well.   It's the BBQ that I would give more like a two or three stars, hence, the three stars since that's probably what the place is known for.  There was probably about 20 of us.   We had two servers, which they were organized and kept things moving along.   Drinks came out in a timely fashion as well as the warm cornbread and butter, which I could have just made a meal from that!  I love pork ribs, as you can probably tell from my prior BBQ reviews.   We could either order a half or a full.   I figured, since I was filling up on the cornbread anyway, I could take most of it home and ordered the full rack.   I asked which was leaner, which our server stated it was the baby back.   I don't want all that pork fat.    The ribs were, mehhhhh, okay.   A bit on the dry side; yes, falling off the bone, but it just lacked that bbq, smoky flavor that I am used to.   The sauce wasn't all that tantalizing either.  Now, the mac and cheese and the mashed taters, that was another thing.   I don't know what kind of cheese it is, but it was creamy and plenty of cheese.   The mashed taters had the skin, which I like, and was quite tasty as well.  I ordered a manhattan, which was good.   It's just that I think someone drank half of it before I got it since the glass was partially filled.   I was wondering what happened to the rest of it.  Would I return?   I would for everything except the Q.    I didn't care for the dryness of the meat and the blandness of the flavoring.",

The server was very positive and professional. Our beef ribs, cornbread, onion loaf, rotisserie chicken, St. Louis ribs, cheeseburger, and kid's meals were all awesome. Portions were hefty, and pricing was very reasonable. This is definitely one of the best barbecue restaurants I've been to in a long time. Best beef ribs and cornbread; hands down. I'll definitely be returning to this great restaurant with my wife and children for another extraordinary experience.",

The night I visited there was a college graduation and a football team in the house.  The line wa backed well into the parking lot and the entire scene was a ballet of highly organized chaos.  They said it was a typical Friday night and took it all in stride. They have a few \"Reserved\" high tops on the bar area...if you are a party of one, ask if you can sit there. The thing to get is the Beef Brisket...so tender it melts in your mouth.  I also wanted to try the Texas Beef Ribs.  This is where the staff shined.  I found the rub to be a bit heavy on the salt and the pepper.  Travis asked how things tasted and I was honest.  He offerd to bring me something else.  In general, I live with my choices so I stuck with the ribs - despite his three tries to bring me an alternative.  The were still good and entirely edible...I chalked it up to my palate.  Blake brought me a side of their delicious Mac and Cheese.   This is a solid 4.5 to 5 experience and I went high because of the service. Oh BTW, 10% discount for Yelp checkin.   I will be back and bring my foodie boss. 9:30 and still a line.",

We had to pick family up at the airport on a Friday night at 5:20 so we had to guess at a time we would be there.  When we got to Bobby Q's a little early there were many people waiting outside and we expected to have a little wait since we were early.  We gave our name and were immediately shown to our table which was great because we had a hungry six year old with us.   Our server was right there to take drink orders and we were able to order for the child so that was nice.   The food was wonderful.  Two of us ordered the Sliced Brisket sandwich and the brisket was moist, smokey , tender just like it should be.  We had someone order the catfish sandwich and they are from the midwest so they know their catfish, it disappeared fast.   The last person ordered the pulled pork tacos and they loved them.   The green chili sauce on the side was a big hit, even with the catfish sandwich person.  The out of towners were delighted with the cornbread before the dinner and the cinnamon sugar donuts at the end.   They loved the atmosphere and especially the lighted patio when we left.  They have already requested to go back next time they come.",

To summarize, the hype is real. This is a must try.  The food was amazing. Ordered the top sirloin cooked medium and ribs, with Mac and cheese, baked potato, and roasted corn for sides. They give you cornbread to start.   Sirloin steak- perfectly aged, cooked, seasoned, and tender. FWIW, it rivals a lot of high end steakhouses.   Ribs- right amount of sauce, balanced, not too tangy or sweet and it's slow cooked. The meat falls right off the bone.  Special mention on the Roasted corn and cornbread - the roasted corn was my favorite side. It came precut in a bowl,  not on the cob. But you could tell the corn was roasted from the appearance. naturally sweet and savory with minimal seasoning. The corn bread is out of this world. I have never had cornbread like this ever.  it's different in a very good way!  What had really made our visit special however was our server, Travis. We told him it was our first time and despite how busy it was he was extremely helpful, patient and friendly.  Travis really demonstrated his passion for his restaurant. He gave us a brief history on the Bobby Qs, made  great recommendations and even convinced us to try the dessert even though we were full. We would've regretted missing the out on the banana pie because it was amazing!  Will be back for sure. Might even have to move to Phoenix.",

The barbecue sauce was both sweet and tangy but not too much of either; my mouth is watering just talking about it again! Tonight I had the two meat dinner which included the prime beef sliced brisket and smoked pulled pork. Again the dish was absolutely perfect, with the pulled pork being just as good as the sliced beef! The service on both nights was equally good, the waiters were friendly and courteous. We didn't make reservations either night but the three of us were seated within 20 minutes on both visits. The place has a surprisingly nice ambience for a barbecue restaurant. You definitely don't want to miss this place if you're in Phoenix and really enjoy BBQ.",

We ordered the baby back and st.louis ribs with brisket, pecan cole slaw, mac and cheese and corn. They started off the meal with their complimentary corn bread, which was pretty good! Their brisket and ribs were tender and you didn't need a knife because it fell off the bone. We asked for their spicy BBQ sauce but I wish it was spicier. For their sides, I really enjoyed their mac and cheese and corn, which I recommend. Their cole slaw was just okay. The portion was perfect for 3 people and we even had some left overs.   To finish off the meal, they bring you fresh mini donuts that they fry and shake with cinnamon sugar. Such a sweet treat!",

Among 5 girls, we ordered a family meal and an additional rack of ribs. -Cornbread: buttery and delicious, but save your appetite! -Meat: enjoyed the baby back ribs over the st. louis; for both types of ribs, the meat falls off the bone; didn't enjoy the pulled pork or beef brisket  -Sides: recommend the cole slaw and mac & cheese; potato salad is decent.  -BBQ sauce: enjoyed the spicy BBQ sauce and used lots of it; regular sauce is too sweet. -Complimentary donuts: just fried dough - nice gesture, but we passed on it.   Bobby Q was super affordable for a hearty, calorie-heavy meal. Good service, ample seating and delicious BBQ.",

And it was the best service and food we've had in AZ, again. We had beef ribs, baby back ribs, pulled pork nachos, loaded potato with pulled pork, mac and cheese, and pecan cole slaw. Each bite more delicious than the last. The kicker was the service. I hate to forget a name of a great server but he had a trimmed beard and said he was born in '88 in a conversation we kicked up. I got a great beer recommendation for a great price during happy hour. He knew the menu and selections by heart. The server gent checked in multiple times but in a very tactful way- never intrusive. The manager, Jason, stopped by, too. They all seemed genuinely interested in the quality of our experience. I hope the kitchen staff and our server get major kudos. We'll absolutely be back and continue to recommend Bobby Qs!",

Ordered hog heaven, thinking it would be sufficient for 2 people - - easily could've fed 4. The meat separated from the bone so well that we skipped the knives. We might even have skipped the fork too because it was quite delicious. The most memorable part was the corn bread. I normally hate corn bread because it's like rolled up dust balls sprinkle with corn essence. Not the ones here. This page turned me into a believer of corn bread and the Arizona charm.   Baby back, St Louis, pulled pork and chicken ranked from favourite to least favorite. Chicken was bland and feels similar to what I would get at Costco. Pulled pork was soft and moist, but the essence came from the BBQ sauce. The ribs though. You can't go wrong with the ribs.",

Our waiter, Christopher, was knowledgeable and attentive, without being overbearing. He explained how several menu items were smoked in house, including the broccoli, which we decided to order. In a word, fantastic. I ended up having the pulled pork sandwich and my daughter decided on the hot wings. Everything was delicious.

Plus, the service couldn't be much better.   Ambience was great and a tad dark with a bit of a rustic feel to it. Too bad it was cold outside that night or we would have eaten out on the patio. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of potato salad. Before that came, we started with a complimentary corn bread which was one of the best corn breads I've ever had. It was warm, sweet, and almost cake-like in texture. Pork from the sandwich was moist and not stringy at all (which is often the case in a lot of BBQ places). The flavor itself was smoky and there was just enough sauce so that the taste of the meat still took center stage. Potato salad was great too and had just the right amount of mayo.   Once we had finished our meal, we were given a bag of complimentary mini donuts to take home. Wow, free cornbread AND donuts? I'm completely sold! I've tried a good amount of restaurants since moving to Arizona about 2 months ago, and Bobby Q is definitely in my top 3.",

I don't know what could have gone any better about this visit. We will be back for sure.",

Our group was large, so we called for reservations (recommended since they are busy, especially over the holidays). We had lunch both times and the food was delicious and the portions were generous.   You would expect the main entrees to be tasty, but the extras were also great. My sister-in-law was still talking about their cornbread a week later, but personally I'm a bigger fan of their free cinnamon donuts. We had the combo platters with a full range from the pulled chicken, brisket, pork, ribs and smoked sausage. Everyone enjoyed their food.   The service was excellent and a great example of how a well run restaurant should operate. Everyone from the server to the manager were focused on ensuring we had a great time.  We've continue to enjoy our visits to Bobby Q's. This is now a mandatory stop whenever we are in the Phoenix area!",

The ranch beans were on the sweeter side but some good beans all together. When the receipt was brought to me for payment I received complementary donuts which I thought was so awesome.

By far the best thing on the menus is their beef brisket. It is so mouth watering good that I crave it as soon as I finish eating it. Today I went to Bobby Qs at the 27th Ave and Dunlap location with my boyfriend for lunch and we were wowed by their service. We were greeted and seated promptly by a sweet hostess and a nice girl who just so happened to be training for her first day. Our server, Gary, was phenomenal and did not hesitate to check up on us at the appropriate times throughout our time there. Our food arrived quickly and as expected tasted great overall. My brisket was a little dry but I decided not to say anything because I still enjoyed it. My boyfriend did however and as we were boxing up our food and the manager gave us a brand new rack immediately without question or charge. As someone who works at a great restaurant too, I was blown away by how professionally and kindly we were treated. I even forgot my purse in the booth and Gary left the restaurant to come running to our car before we drove away to give it back to me. All in all, Bobby Q has surpassed our expectation of great quality and service not just by the food but by the staff and ambiance and we shall continue to enjoy many great memories there. Came back on Valentines Day and once again received nothing but exceptional service  Thank you to the manager Cam for being so accommodating to us and making our little date 10 times better! Will always be a fan of this place and this location they do an amazing job at everything",

The chicken and brisket were fantastic.   BBQ sauce was ok.  Decor and atmosphere were cool!   Nothing special or super cool on the cocktail list.   Definitely make a reservation on the weekends. They are crazy busy and the wait is long if you just walk in.   Honestly, just about any BBQ place in Texas is comparable or better than Bobby Q's. If you want BBQ it is good but nothing special.",

My issue is he grabbed my ID and moved to the other side of the table holding my ID down and very close to the person across the table in clear view. IDs contain personal info, such as an ADDRESS!!!!!!!! He held my ID so long that this person I was out with could have taken down my address. Need training on proper measurements and safety precautions when checking IDs.   Moving on, the drinks weren't good to me.. I tried 3 different drinks, The Hammer (or whatever), that drink that comes in a pineapple, and some sangria type drink in a jar with blueberries.. yeah, just no! All three?! Come on.. a better drink menu please.   Lastly, we move into my meal. It was pretty good. Had the salmon dinner.  Now, the lady Alicia ( not sure if I spelled it right) I'm assuming she's the manager, was great came over twice to ask if the drinks were better and make sure the food was tasting good. Very nice lady",

I had a brisket sandwich with a baked potato and my husband had the salmon dinner with fries and mac & cheese.

The I-10 shooter couldn't even stop me from getting to my barbecue beef ribs and buying chef Mark H. a drink.  I was greeted by a lovely hostess and waitress named Jessica.  I got seated at a large booth, ordered a drink, and my beef ribs.  The drink and food appeared quickly.  The Bobby Q experience is simply the best.  The whole staff is just plain awesome.  Various people came by to bus plates, ask how I was doing, and see if there was anything they could help me with.  It was a great meal with some serious cornbread and mini-doughnut dessert.  I LOVE PEOPLE FROM PHOENIX AND I LOVE COMING TO BOBBY Q!  Unfortunately, chef Mark was not there, but I did make my flight home.  Chef Mark, if you read this, \"I owe you a drink.\"",

    "text": "So I just recently moved to Phoenix from Indy and after a day of shopping a friend suggested that we go get some BBQ, I'm not one that usually seeks out BBQ so I gave her a meh, but went along anyway and I'm glad I did.  If I were a bride at the altar and I was told I could never have Bobby Q ever again if I married the man in front of him I'd have to think twice before saying those vows as I'd question the sanity and ill intent of the Benedict Arnold standing before me. In short THIS PLACE IS FRIGGEN AWESOME!!!   I was able to get a 3 meat platter for $25.00 and stingy is not something that resides in this place's vocabulary. I got more on one plate than I could for $25.00 at the grocery store and when they sat the behemoth of a plate before me I was full before I took a bite. The meat slides off the bone so you will need a fork...and a bib...and a belt extender. The flavor was fantastic from the sauce, to the meat, to the macaroni, to the corn bread, to the napkins, and to the free doughnuts after. The staff is super quick and friendly! I took food home and was really sad when the last of it was gone... So here I am here again on my second of what will be a lifetime of trips leaving a review as I wait to be seated, question is why are you still reading this and not here yet?  :-)",

Our server was CJ and he was attentive and quick to give suggestions and answer all questions.   Very happy we tried it and we will be back on our next trip to Phoenix!",

    "text": "Great BBQ joint in Phoenix! Such a good experience!  This place seemed like it was in a random location/nothing around the area, but maybe that's just because it was dark out and we were just trying to find the restaurant. The parking lot is large to accommodate all the people they likely have every night.    We were greeted and seated immediately. Inside the ambiance was pretty loud and fun. Lots of space and seating, so groups are great here. When you walk in, you also might notice the doughnut making machine on the right. Try to save some room for those at the end! They're pretty good, and you get them complimentary!   The service overall was good, fast and friendly. No complaints at all.  The food was really good as well! We got the Whole Hog Heaven. For two people, we really didn't come close to finishing this, so this might be good for three people, or four with smaller appetites. The meat was all delicious! I thought the brisket and pulled pork was a touch on the dry side, but I just threw some more sauce on and all was good. The cornbread is lite and fluffy, and the sides were great. Of all the meats, I actually thought the St Louis Ribs had the most flavor. And then, there was the doughnuts! Cinnamon Sugar I think. I don't think I have ever seen something like this given out complimentary before! What a nice touch!  Overall, great bbq spot in Phoenix! Highly recommend this place!",

We ordered a combo platter with two types of ribs and two types of meet... DELICIOUS.

The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The cornbread was warm and tender and sweet. The mac and cheese was flavorful, not pasty. The fries were thin cut and crispy. What a great meal. We took some of it home and it was just as great the next day. The only thing I was disappointed in was the beans. They tasted like vinegar. They really need to do a BBQ bean which would go with everything else. I forgave them when they gave us a little bag of freshly made doughnuts. Just the right thing to end the meal. So go! Take your kids, your relatives and friends. This is some good eats!",

We sat at the bar because the wait was long and I wasn't feeling well. We weren't crazy over the menu, so we shared a pulled chicken sandwich with French fries. Hubby loved the sandwich and I ate the fries. What stuck out wasn't the food though, as it was mediocre and could have done without. The service was just so excellent. The people were nice as could be and we did not wait a second for anything. At one point, we had 4 hands reaching for our dirty plates. I haven't experienced that good of service in years, anywhere. It was a packed house, yet all the workers seemed chill and happy. It was refreshing. I always dreamed of owning my own business and those employees would be the ones I would want. It's hard in that industry to be genuinely nice, but these people are nailing it. I'd give 5 stars but, the food was just good, not like we have to go back and can't live without.",

    "text": "YUM!!! I would recommend this place if you are in the Phoenix area. My co-worker and I heard nothing but good things about it, so we decided to check it out.  Atmosphere: The exterior is quite deceiving. It looks like an old, big shack. The interior is gigantic and cozy. It is clean and organized. There's a pretty bar area, a doughnut station, and lots of tables. They have a separate area with another bar that I think is used for private parties or probably weekend nights. There were some cool decorations on the walls all over the place.  Service: It was great!!! Our server was so knowledgeable. She was friendly and personable, and she had fantastic, flawless makeup! Lol. A manager came by our table to see how we were doing during our meal. It added a nice touch knowing that they cared.  Food: Delicious! Cornbread? Yes! I ordered the grilled shrimp with macaroni and corn. The shrimp was cooked to perfection! And the seasoning was great. It was also great on the corn. I probably could've just eaten corn as a full meal and been happy. Hehehe. The macaroni was delicious, but it was as good as my mother-in-law's. Lol. My co- worker really enjoyed her meal - pulled pork and coleslaw. We split a dessert - the mud pie, and it was good, but we were hoping it'd be on par with the rest of the food. It wasn't, but it didn't take away from the meal. The best was probably the doughnuts!!! They give out free mini doughnuts. They are fresh and sooo wonderful!!! Don't forget them on your way out!",

    "text": "Growing up, Bobby McGee's Restaurant used to be a staple eatery that my family and friends loved. We knew we could get good food and enjoy a setting that was colorful, eclectic, and maybe even charming in its own special way... if that's not too far-fetched..all at the same time. Once I moved onto college, and others went their separate ways, we all forgot about Bobby McGee's. It would often be a topic that would arise at a dinner convo, \"What ever happened to that one place we used to go to near 27th Avenue and Northern?\" But that was all that ever materialized.  Luckily, I was reunited with this restaurant, now known as Bobby-Q's. It has since transitioned into a Kansas City/Texas mixture type barbecue, but still a great atmosphere! After a long day of rock climbing, my friends and I were famished and they suggested getting barbecue. Once we arrived, all the memories started flooding back of this place, and I love what it's become. The barbecue is really good! It's actually one of my favorites, I'm surprised to say. Three of us shared the Whole Hog Heaven, which is a major platter where you can choose 2 ribs, 2 meats, and 3 sides. Our selections: the Baby Back ribs, the beef ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket, potato salad, macaroni and cheese, and grilled veggies. The rib meat was tender and \"fall off the bone\" type texture. The  baby back ribs were by far my favorite of the bunch.   While waiting for our order, our group also shared the smoked brisket Q-rolls with chipotle dip. These were really delicious but kind of reminded me of eating a mini chimi since the phylo dough was so flaky and crispy. There was a small heap of roasted corn served on the plate as well that was super smoky in flavor.   Even though it is the middle of winter, the patio was still very comfortable since all the heaters overhead were on. There is a metal waterfall sculpture that extends the entire length of the patio so it is very soothing and entertaining to have the sound of \"rain\" behind you as you're eating outside. Ashlynn, our waitress, was very accommodating to our large group of 7 that even included 3 super energetic kids. She even treated us with extra doughnuts at the end when we were finishing our meal. We will definitely return again and again to Bobby Q's!",

This was one of the best I've ever had. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a baked potato. Baked potato was good nothing to brag about, the pulled pork sandwich was good and tasty. My friend ordered the wings and thought they were just okay. He also had the Mac and cheese that he said was really good. To drink I had a Poloma this was really good. Overall the food was good, great. Customer service. I'd go back.",

Two of my family members really liked the complimentary corn bread and took some extra home. I had the ribeye with the side order of shrimp, both amazing, especially the sauce on the shrimp and the temperature of the ribeye was perfect. One of my friends who had been there previously ordered a salad she had there before that was no longer on the menu, so they accommodated her request. But unfortunately they didn't have avocado or forgot it on her salad, so they comped it and also gave us free dessert. One of the managers came by a few times to check on us and made sure we were ok with everything else. Overall we had a great experience despite the avocado-less salad, and my friend was still happy with her meal, especially the Q-rolls she made sure we tried!",

    "text": "Just thinking about writing this review is making my mouth water... One of my husband and I's favorite date spots. We always prefer to sit at the bar. I love the warm atmosphere. Makes me feel like I'm in a real BBQ joint somewhere in the South. I have never been here when it's not busy. There is typically a wait, but usually not for the bar. (Pro-tip and part of why we are \"Bar People.\")As you walk through the front door, you are not only hit with the delicious smell of BBQ, but something else... Cinnamon? YES! Right behind the Hostess stand, you will notice a few of the girls making fresh, home-made, cinnamon and sugar covered donuts. They place them in cute little paper bags and they come with every meal. Even when you think you are so full, you couldn't stuff anything else in your belly... they hand you these melt in your mouth, warm, fresh out of the fryer, donuts. And you will finish them. Trust me.   But let's start at the beginning shall we? Guest's get a complimentary basket of their home made Cornbread after they are sat, always nice, but I try to save as much room as possible for the good stuff. I have never gone to Bobby Q's without first ordering the Q-Rolls to start. The BBQ Version of a Taquito. A white tortilla, filled with Smoked Brisket and served with a chipotle dipping sauce. These little babies are the best \"Taquito's\" you will ever have in your life. The chipotle sauce is a bit sweet and compliments not only the chipotle but the Brisket very well.   As for dinner, my husband and I always share and rarely come home without a to-go box. Our Favorite dinner to order is the Pick 2 Wood Fired Barbeque Platter. The Sliced Beef Brisket and the Smoked Chicken are my favorites. The Brisket is so tender, you can cut it with your fork. (That goes for any of the meats really. No need for a knife here unless you get a steak.) Drizzled with their House, Home-made BBQ Sauce. Perfectly sweet and tangy. The Chicken with its smoky, smothered in BBQ Goodness its juicy and tender. We have had the ribs, the pulled pork, and the sausage. Pretty much anything under the Platters section of the menu... we have had it, and I have yet to leave feeling unsatisfied. As far as sides go... I don't care what you get as long as you also get the Mac & Cheese. This is a MUST!! So creamy and decedent. It's hard to finish sometimes. The best Mac I have ever tasted.   And there you have it. The best BBQ this side of Phoenix. I dare anyone to say different. Ok... I need to mop up my keyboard now and head to Bobby Q's ASAP. See you there!",

They sat us down and Kevin was our server who immediately came up and took our drink & appetizer order. Moscow mule, Iced tea, waters and something called a Q roll (deep fried tortilla with machaca beef) recommended by Kevin. The wife and I ended up sharing the 3 meat combo (baby back ribs, brisket & sausage) with mashed potatoes & Macaroni and cheese! EVERYTHING was delicious!!!! Best BBQ we've ever had, hands down! Next time we're out this way or know anybody who's coming out here, we will definitely recommend you all! Kevin, you are a stud and appreciate your hustle and attentiveness. You deserve a raise buddy!",

My son opted for a cheeseburger and fries. My mother and I split a 2 meat platter. Baby back ribs, pulled pork, Mac n cheese, grilled veggies, and cornbread. The cornbread was served like an appetizer and had a sweet flavor and was very soft. The ribs were fall off the bone amazing and the pulled pork was to die for. We probably did not even need the sides but the Mac and cheese was thick and cheesy. The grilled veggies could have used a little seasoning but they were still pretty good. Oh let me not forget about sauce. It was sweet but not too sweet. We even tried the spicy which I don't think had a single hot element!!! I would definitely go back here!!",

They have an old water feature that attracted a mass amount of flies. Although the food was probably good. We could not enjoy or even taste the food over the amount of flies. We couldn't wait to be done eating. We kept napkins over our drinks and plate so we didn't end up drinking or eating a fly. It was not an enjoyable experience at all. And although we were constantly fending off flies and voiced our concerns, neither the waitress nor the manager offered to move our seats. It was a horrible experience and we did not finish our food nor did we want to take it home. I'd like to try it again but am now a little nervous.",

(FYI, intentionally not calling her out to give some protection just in case lol).",

I typically have an open face sandwich and just eat the meat and not the bun because a meal is too much food if you can't get someone to share.   The specialty cocktails are also very good.",

I have to admit this place has made me a bit of a ribs snob, if something doesnt come close to Bobby Q's i automatically right that place off.  A short review but you get the gist of it...",

The main purpose was to check out the grand canyon and catch a baseball game but I ended up finding one of the best BBQ joints in the country. After trying Memphis, Carolinas and Texas BBQ...the last place i expected to find great BBQ food would be in the desert. I noticed the big sign while driving down the highway and decided to go in. Its an upscale kind of atmosphere...well compared to what you find in Texas. Nice patio for dining when its not to hot. We got the 4 meat platter...and it was some of the best BBQ I have ever come across. I only wish they had one in Jersey. The have some great appetizers and mixed drinks in pineapples as well. Good wait staff, great mac n cheese too!! TRY IT",

The meat was smokey and very tasty.  Well done, but I was OK with that. The sides of Mac and Cheese were some of the best I've ever tasted and their seasoned fries were awesome!  My friend had their pulled pork sandwich and it was 2-3 star rating. It was bland tasting and needed lots of their BBQ sauce for flavor. Their coleslaw was also missing a flavor punch, so he added some hot sauce to help it out.  The donuts were \"meh\" a little too greasy and needed the tons of sugar.  Why make them if they are just \"meh\", your cornbread is much better!    Looking forward to trying their ribs, surf & turf and banana cake on my next visit!",

Cornbread was served - delicious, sweet, buttery.  Next came a a 50/50 order of beef ribs/brisket with roasted corn and baked beans, a 50/50 of brisket/baby back ribs with walnut coleslaw and mac & cheese, and a pulled chicken sandwich.   Long story short, orgasms ensued. The beef ribs I had, were fall off the bone tender, smoky, slathered in perfect amounts of sauce, and just so so so so damn juicy and cooked like they said they do it. The meat just fell off when I bit into it, and the bbq sauce was so sweet and perfect. I would dunk all the food I ever eat for the rest of my life in this sauce. Probably the best ribs I ever had. The brisket was delicious, fork tender, not dry at all (close to the best I've ever had). The beans were porky, smokey, and flavorful, and the roasted corn was so so deliciously roasted.  Finished the night off with a peach cobbler, which was pretty much illegal. Ice cream melted into a deliciously cinnamon nutmeg concoction of sweetness and cobbler, the most perfect grandma-made style cobbler  I've ever had. Not too tart, not too sweet, just perfect.   Best BBQ i ever had. LEGIT",

The Horsestring Fries and the vegetables were not good. The fries were super salty. We had to ask them to remake it, but it took so long after we finished our meats that we just told them to forget about bringing it out. The vegetables were unflavored and not good.  The ribs and the brisket were BOMB! The ribs were so tender and breaks off so easily!! Super delicious!! I would pass on the chicken and order something else.   Service and management were super friendly. I liked how the server told us background of what this restaurant is and how long they cook their meats. He said they cook it 16 hours.

    "text": "I didn't know once I stepped into this dimly lit, vivacious establishment that my life would be changed forever. From the groovy bangers to the tender, well-seasoned meats, Bobby Q has everything you ever wished for in a restaurant.  However, the grandeur of the restaurant does not stop there. After indulging in some moist corn bread, I decided that I wanted a cocktail that would freshen my night up. But there were so many choices in their diverse menu, how could I ever choose? I was set on ordering the Watermelon Cooler, and called over a mysterious waiter, Dylan, to tell him my order. Little did I know his service and demeanor would be the spark in my sudden revelation. Dylan was the amalgamation of Paul Rudd, Chris Pratt, and Chris Evans and quite frankly any other marvel super hero with confidence, bravery, and class. Once I ordered, he respectively gave me his opinion on my drink choice, saying that it was not one of his favorites, and steered me in the right direction with the El Chingo, a smokey, zesty vanilla and cinnamon wonderland. He said that if this drink wasn't for me, he would also give me the cooler with no added charge. Trusting his confident opinion, I went with the Chingo and was blown away by the flavor explosion. From then on our whole dining experience was taken to another level by his helpful comments and playful aura. Our server, Dylan, has sparked some self-reflection in myself that I didn't know I needed. I came to Bobby Q's looking to have a delightful meal with my family, which was easily achieved, but have left this fine establishment with a new outlook on life and humanity.",

Never have I had a bad experience here and I'm so glad! I shared the huge hog dinner (forgot the exact name) and wow. I've gone to several bbq places in Arizona, Texas, and California, and this is on the top of my list. Their meat is never dry or chewy, the chicken/ribs fall off the bone and are so flavorful, and the sides you can't go wrong with. Bobby q's is the perfect place to take a date, friends, or your family. They never disappoint, which is why I always come back.",

    "text": "First of all, kudos to Bobby Q's staff. Absolutely EVERYONE was super friendly and attentive. I was waited on in some way by at least 5 different members of their team, at least 1 of whom I believe was the manager. Everyone smiled and made eye contact, and they all seemed genuinely concerned that my needs were being met, and that I was getting what I wanted. I was immediately greeted with a smile when I walked in, and smiled at the entire time I was there. I really did experience 5 star service.  The ambiance was casual, rustic, and interesting in its own way.   The bartender came right over (you guessed it - with a big smile) and when I indicated that I had not been in before, she immediately explained about the lunch menu and the various options in just enough detail. She left me to fill my drink order while I considered my choices.   I decided on the Platter Sampler, which allowed me to choose three kinds of meat, a side and cornbread. I figured that this would give me a chance to check out more than 1 item. Of the sides, the roasted corn was the most appealing to my tastes. I also ordered their shoestring fries. I don't have the capacity to consume large amounts of food, but with that long a drive, I wanted to try lots of things, even if I couldn't finish them.  A few minutes later, I overheard a couple of gentlemen at the end of the bar ordering meatloaf. Wondering how I had overlooked that, I studied the menu some more, but didn't see meatloaf anywhere. When I asked, the bartender indicated that they periodically have off menu specials. Since I had come so far, I ordered the meatloaf (only $9.99) to go.  My food came out very quickly, and there was a lot of it. Portion sizes were generous. I had opted for a combination of Brisket, St. Louis Ribs, and Spicy Smoked Link Sausage.   The roasted corn was not corn on the cob, although the dish was topped off with two slices from the end of a roasted ear of corn. The off the cob corn had kernels that looked like they had seen fire. The juice that the corn was in had a good solid smokey flavor to it. I had anticipated and would have preferred roasted corn on the cob. To my personal tastes, it wasn't great, but it also wasn't bad.  The shoestring fries were perfectly cooked, thinly cut, skin on, and nicely salted. It was a HUGE order that came out in a little pail. I could have made a whole lunch out of the fries alone! I hardly put a dent in them.  Turning to my platter of meat, I was somewhat disappointed overall.   There were several slices of brisket. It was extremely moist, almost mushy as if it had been cooked in liquid, and there was no smoke ring. I've lived and eaten all over the country, including Texas and the Carolinas. I have had good smoked brisket, and this bore no resemblance. It was more like pot roast or meat you would find in stew, with no smokey flavor. In fact, the corn had more smokey flavor than my brisket. I would not order the brisket again because I think this must just be the way they have decided to prepare it. Maybe lots of people love it. Maybe they've never had better. I didn't like it.  The sliced link sausage was missing the usual coarse texture of sausage, with the textures of fat and lean. The mouth feel was as if it has been boiled, or in liquid at a sufficient heat to cook the fat out of it. That left the texture sort of like moist cardboard. The flavor coming through wasn't bad, but the effect was like nicely seasoned boiled cardboard. (It took me the entire drive home to figure out a truthful way to describe it.) Perhaps this batch had just been sitting in warm moisture too long. I'm going to go back and read through the reviews again to see if I'm the only one who experienced this.  The St. Louis Ribs saved the day for the meats. Except for being a bit fatty, and a general lack of smokey flavor, they weren't bad. Not great, but not bad.  The good news was my take-out meatloaf special. I swear my portion of meatloaf was nearly 2 pounds! It was also tasty! It wasn't what I expected as it had more pungently savory ingredients than I am accustomed to in meatloaf, including a degree of heat, although not excessive. It was topped with a generous portion of golden fried onions, and accompanied by a huge serving of skin on mashed red potatoes! The only downside for me was the gravy, which I am grateful came in a separate container on the side. I'm not a fan of tarragon or thyme or whatever it was loaded with. Lots of people at the bar were eating it, but I didn't notice whether or not they used/ate the gravy. Simply a matter of preference I guess.  Please consider this review with a grain of salt. I've traveled and eaten extensively, but I'm not a critic. I just know what I like. You may love what Bobby Q's has to offer. The only thing that I am really sold on is the wonderful customer service. I'll also throw in that they appear to have lots of regulars, and that lunch appeared to be a bustling affair with no lack of diners.",

The service here is super quick and everyone is really nice. BONUS: They also give complimentary sugar donuts! I would totally recommend giving Bobby Q a try!!!",

I've tried all the BBQ spots in the East Valley i.e. Joe's, Famous Daves and I am indifferent to them. A drug rep brought us catered lunch from Bobby Q's and I had never heard of it. They have received national awards for their food and apparently they won State Best Mac&Cheese. We had cornbread, mac& cheese, pulled pork sweet & spicy flavors, coleslaw, and salad. I tried really hard not to go back for seconds on the Mac & Cheese and Pulled Pork that was catered at our office, but I my will power cracked and I dove back into the M&C and pork. It is so good, the flavoring is on point, the coleslaw is crisp and not runny. I'm a fan for sure. If I'm in the area I will definitely try to check out the actual restaurant and take my family or friends there.",

    "text": "I stopped in for lunch during the work week. It is located not too far from my employer; however, I had never visited previously. Having lived in Atlanta for 12 years I enjoy barbecue, but have not found too many places in Phoenix that it well. My initial experience with Bobby Q was via catering at a work function. It was very good, especially for catered food and I added it to my mental list of places to try, but continually forgot to actually go. A few work friends were having a happy hour get-together and again I passed it up. Finally I went for lunch and was suddenly said that I have missed prior opportunities to go.   I sat at a table in the bar area and the service was good. I had the sweet tea, which is a requisite for any good barbecue meal. The menu had several good looking items, but I went with the pulled chicken sandwich and a side of mac & cheese. The sandwich was excellent and I would put it right at the top of the Phoenix barbecue list. While the sandwich was great, the mac & cheese was phenomenal and I would rate it as the second best I have ever tried. I envisioned myself as David Blaine shackled into a phone booth filled with this mac & cheese and I had to eat my way out to survive. I win that battle my friend. I win that battle 9 times out of 10. And the doughnut things on the way out? Yes, please!  I will most definitely be back. I may go with the chicken again or try another tasty item from the menu, but whatever I get it will come with a side of mac & cheese.",

Baked beans had meat shredded in them and were amazing. They give you complimentary sugar donuts to take home at the end and omg they were the perfect way to end the meal. So fresh & warm, soft & sugary! We were stuffed and left with enough left overs for another meal for two! I highly recommend this place & will definitely be back!",

The food was excellent, customer service was awesome as well, I would highly recommend this place, if you are in town.    Our waitress was Chelsea and she was excellent to check in on us every 10 minutes and we were also checked on by the manager lady and she was also very nice and wanted to make sure everything was okay.  Between myself, wife and a daughter, we have decided to try their \"Hog Heaven\"  and their Q roll.  We chose, baby back, St. Louis rib, brisket, chicken then mac & cheese, pecan coleslow and potato salad. They were all excellent, especially the free corn bread.  Chelsea the waitress had enough sense to bring us the free miniature donuts along with our bills, when we didn't even ask for them.  All in all, this was one of my best experience at a BBQ joint. The bill came out to around $80 for food and couple of beers on tap,  which is very reasonable. This is a must go place, if you are into BBQ!",

I ordered a Whole Hog Heaven for me and my hubby with bottle of wine, and for my daughter I ordered the pull pork sandwich.  Alright people, the barbeque was ok and for the people who have dentures this is place for them.  The ribs, meat melt of the bone alright but it's too mushy.  I can't even pick up the bone because the mushy meats just melt in the tray.  Good bbq ribs, meat should attach to the bones when you break it and melted in your mouth when you eat it that's call good bbq people.  Their pull pork was good and their corn bread was delicious seriously, but the brisket was too dried and the meat is brownish like old meats.  After tasting the brisket I just stop eating my dinner.  Lucky I had a bottle of wine.  Good brisket supposed to be little char on the outside, pinkish inside, and juicy.  Barbeque sauce normally served on the side because the good briskets meats are juicy and tender; therefore, the sauce doesn't need to poor all over the brisket.  Our server was alright doesn't know much about wine though, but I can't complaints because I'm not at fine dining.  The ambience was ok, music ok, but menu little greasy and some bread crumbs in it that's not so ok to me.  The price is very cheap.  Quantity is beyond my expectation but need to work on quality of foods.  For three of us the bill comes to $86.37 including tips.  I hope this review help some of you, thank you!",

    "text": "Ohhhh where do I begin??? The weekend is usually a tough time for my wife and I. We scour Yelp! all day to find the perfect new place to go out to eat on a Saturday night. On this particular Saturday it was my turn to choose the spot. I was in the mood for BBQ, but was some what tired of the usual places on our list. Well then came Bobby Q's! Coming from the Surprise area it was an easy ride down Olive to Black Canyon Hwy. As stated several times already, the place is somewhat hard to spot as it i set back from the road with limited signage, but we made it into the lot on our second pass. It was about 6:30 and we didn't have reservations, but fear not! The wait we were told would only be about 20 minutes. The time came and went however no open table. The greeter apologized for the delay, but offered for us to wait in the VIP lounge for a drink and free onion block appetizer. We no sooner go our drink and the table was ready! Everything was moved over to our table and away were went to enjoy our dinner. The service was as good as it gets, A+! My wife went for the Smoasted Chicken with sides of baked potato, and roasted corn. I opted for the slow roasted beef brisket sandwich, and a side of mac and cheese. Once the server brought over the onion block, and corn bread we wee set. The onion block was fantastic and big enough for up to three people. The corn bread was perhaps the best I was had in all of Arizona! My wife rated her chicken dish an 8 and sides a 8 as well. When all was said and done...she was STUFFED! As for myself, the sandwich was just big enough to satisfy my apatite, and was delivered just as the menu stated! Deeeeelishous! As for the mac & cheese...have you ever had something so good it cold buckle your knees? Yeah, it was THAT good! No matter what you order from the menu, get a side of mac & cheese! As we finished up the owner himself came over to our table to see how our experience went. The OWNER! Not some manager, but the man himself! When all was said and done the bill came to just under $30. I did not order a Alcohol based drink, only Dr. Pepper, but they too looked top notch from those around us who indulged. Bottom line is this place is now my favorite BBQ spot in the valley, and given the chance it will be yours too!",

    "text": "We read the reviews and were expecting a very good to excellent BBQ experience. Unfortunately, we had a mediocre to average dinner.  We tried \"the whole hog\" and expected generous portions of ribs, chicken, and sausage for the price.  We received lunch portions--at best.  The ribs were very dry albeit they fell off the bone.  The chicken was average and the sausage on the tasteless side.  The BBQ sauce was typical and really too sweet for this type of fare.  The corn was greasy, the fries were average string fries, and the mac and cheese was good (according to my wife since I think typical mac and cheese is too bland). We passed on dessert but we were given a gift of two small doughnuts that left a serious grease stain in the bag.  I thought the doughnuts were a weird accompaniment to this BBQ dinner.  I must commend the service as prompt, courteous, and very friendly--bravo.  Overall, the experience was so lackluster that we would be unlikely to return.  I did note that the bar and lounge scene was very active while the dining room had plenty of empty tables at 6 on a Friday.  Perhaps one should consider this more a bar and lounge and secondarily as a BBQ Emporium.  Something to thin about.  If you are looking for serious BBQ--look somewhere else.",

Went there on Sunday and got the Family fest (1/2 lb ribs, 1/2 lbs pull pork, 1/2 lb brisket, 1/2 chicken plus 2 sides) for $28.00. This is the best BBQ that i have tasted. The brisket can be cut with a fork and melts in your mouth. The chicken is not dry but moist (even the chicken breast). The one thing i do want to try is a 22-hour smoked prime rib....until next spring training, i will have to wait. Also, mention yelp and get 10% off your bill!!!",

    "text": "I went there last night for Happy Hour (which is available in their lounge section). Let me say the food was WOW. I kept hearing about this place's food and finally decided to go try it myself. My boyfriend and I were surprised how dead the lounge was, as we both have been there on Friday and Saturday nights and the place is packed. Anyway, they offer 1/2 price appetizers from 4-8 Tuesday-Friday. We ordered their Jumbo Wings, asked if they come with a medium sauce, waitress said no. So I asked for sauce on the side, as I don't like very spicy food. Also ordered a brisket quesadilla and beer fries. The wings were very big, all drumsticks. Perfectly fried, very meaty, and their wing sauce is not too spicy, it was delicious. Perfect wing sauce I say, not too thick or thin, full of flavor, with a little kick. Excellent. The brisket quesadilla was huge, very meaty, and the meat inside was perfectly tender. The beer fries, oh the fries! The waitress told me about them, they are not on the menu, you have to ask for them. They were the best I've ever had. For fries, you don't expect much. They're fries for God's sake, but these fries are something to talk about. Crisp, flavorful, salty with a little sweet. Definitely a must try! I'm excited to actually go eat in the restaurant section next time! DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

We got the Whole Hog Heaven--baby back ribs, beef ribs, pulled pork, and brisket--to share between us two and we absolutely demolished that platter. In like 10 minutes. It was that good. Everything was incredible, ESPECIALLY the baby back ribs, and their BBQ sauce is my latest favorite. Our server, Tanner, was nice and attentive. They give you a little bag of donuts after, but I haven't tried them yet since there's literally no room for anything else in my stomach.",

My first experience with Bobby Q's was a few years back and I still think to this day that it is some of the best BBQ I have had. The great thing about Bobby Q's is that its not all about the BBQ but they also have really amazing burgers, appetizers, and those delicious little cinnamon sugar donuts at the end! Just the thought of those little pillowy sugary donuts makes me drool! Q rolls as an appetizer is a must and their spinach and artichoke dip is fantastic as well.   I would recommend this restaurant to anybody who was looking for really delicious BBQ!",

My boyfriend and I ordered the three meat combo (baby back ribs, beef brisket, pulled pork) with 2 sides (mac & cheese and fries); and we split the order between the two of us. The meat from the baby back ribs was super tender, and easily fell off the bone - just the way I like it. The beef brisket was also tender, and very flavorful. The pulled pork was extremely juicy, giving you that gratification when you bite into it. Two thumbs up on their meat. Nothing spectacular about the mac & cheese and fries though.   Service was great. I was with some friends who have never been here before, and the waitress patiently explained the menu. She also made some good recommendations to them. I was very happy with her fast service, splitting the check amongst our group correctly and quickly getting out those togo boxes.   The best part about having a full belly at the end of your dinner is getting free complimentary donuts. I can't say \"no\" to sugar donuts! Love this place.",

The food was super good, the service was great, and the restaurant looked very clean and nice.   We came at around 12pm and there wasn't a line, and we were seated at a large table. The waitresses were very nice, and brought us water once we sat down. We saw the fresh mini donuts being made near the front of the door and they kindly gave us some before our meal; the donuts were dusted with cinnamon sugar and they were delicious! The donuts were soft, warm, and perfectly fried. After the donuts, we decided on the Whole Hog, which was quite a lot of food for three girls. The whole hog came with St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, three sides (which we ordered shoe string fries, mashed potatoes, and corn), BBQ chicken, and brisket, as well as cornbread. The cornbread was buttery and delicious, and it tasted great with the whipped butter. The bbq was honestly the best I have yet to have! The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, and the meat had a good fat-to-meat ratio. Of the meats, my favorite was the smokey St. Louis ribs, which were less saucy and contained chewy tendons (if you're into that like I am). The mashed potatoes was also super buttery and smooth, and tasted almost like a dip. Also, the waitress brought two pitchers of BBQ sauce, one spicy and one original, so be prepared to drench all the meat in even more sauce.   After the meal, the waitress was super kind and brought us another round of donuts!   I would highly recommend this place if you're in Phoenix! The food was amazing, the staff was super friendly, and the sides and donuts make this place stand out.",

We had a great server who was very friendly and attentive. Got our waters quickly, followed by the delicious cornbread. I usually order the pulled pork, but this time I decided to get the pulled bbq chicken sandwich with mac & cheese. Didn't take long to get our food. Requested the regular BBQ sauce. The food was good, especially the mac & cheese which is very rich and yummy. Was interesting to see some vapor coming in from a fog machine in the adjacent club. I like the moist towelettes they give you to clean your hands after the meal. And perhaps the best part? The mini donuts! Our server even brought us some extra and offered to get us waters to go. The donuts were hot and scrumptious. Mmm mm! I think they raised their prices since the last time we came, but it's still a good value. Be prepared to leave full and happy.",

Truly one the best BBQ places in greater Phoenix.  My mouth is watering as I'm thinking about the Hog Heaven special.  In fact, my puppies mouths are watering too.  Decent prices, giant selection.  One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate.     If you are a cracker family, I suggest going super early, like super early bird special early , like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early, because after dusk, the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud, super dicey Mexican Dance Club, and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club.     Ah the sacrifice for decent BBQ....",

There is a sign above the place that says \"Voted Best in the U.S.\" which really has me scratching my head.  Best what???  Certainly not the BBQ!  And certainly not in the U.S.!  I had the baby back ribs and they came out absolutely swimming in overly sweet sauce.  My wife had the Southern Fried Chicken and it came out soggy and undercooked.  I only complain because of the pretentious signs proclaiming they are the best and the really high price tag on the dishes.    As I said, the service was good and the place is very nice inside and out.  I would love to try something else like their steaks, but honestly with a first try this bad I can't go back.  Unfortunately, with the exception of one place in Phoenix, there is still nowhere to get quality bbq in town.  Seems everyone's definition of BBQ here is crushing every piece of meat with ridiculously tangy sauce to cover the fact that they don't know what they're doing.",

Immediately distracted by so many strange bbq scuba situations. Either way, turned out to be kitschy in a great, not overwhelming or mass produced way. Wood paneling, mirrored saloon doors, and roasting chickens on a spit. We were seated immediately and our server was very friendly/fast. Beer/cocktail selection was meh. Q rolls were really good. Spinach dip was ok, made better by garlic bread sticks. In my opinion the real shining star was the mystery bag the server dropped off when we paid. Oh look a cute doggie bag FILLED WITH FRESH HOME MADE CINNAMON SUGAR DONUTS. These were spontaneous drool level, manna from heaven level good. Next time I want the ribs and maybe 9 or ten bags of donuts.",

My wife had the rib platter, very tasty, juicy and the BBQ sauce was delicious.  I had a Catfish Po'Boy along with a side of Mac n' Cheese, both were great.

Again, out of the way, from where we were staying anyway.  Another place smack dab in the middle of a neighborhood. Another place with friendly service, amusing barfly regulars, and good food.  If it weren't so hot in Phoenix, I'd have a crisis about living arrangements!  Happy Hour in the bar was great: $3.00 large beers on tap and 1/2 off appetizers. We shared some hot wings which were very tasty. I wanted more of those, for sure.  After about 3 or 4 beers, we went with the Whole Hog Feast. The name alone is awesome!  For 36 bucks we got: -Baby Back Ribs -St. Louis Ribs -Pulled Pork -Beef Brisket -Mac N. Cheese -Cole Slaw -Baked Potato -Cornbread  Um, hello?!?! This was so much food and it was all good!  The cornbread was sweet and had great texture; meat was tender and flavorful, mac n cheese was rich and creamy. A little spicy bbq sauce on the side to kick everything up was a nice addition. Mouth is watering a little now just typing it out!  Although we were stuffed (and had a full to go box ready), we had to try the Peach Cobbler. So good.  Again, if I lived nearby, my pants would be in serious jeopardy of fitting properly! =)",

    "text": "In these days of turmoil in the world and a rough economy, a place where you can go to feel the warm fuzzies, be cozy, and get good value for your money would be what you're looking for, right?   Well then, you have found it at Bobby Q.  And even non-carnivores can enjoy themselves.  The moment I got out of my car the seductive scents of smokey bbq wafted into my nose.  Winding through the patio with a bit of a ramschackle look with plants and tin and who knows else (but it's all for show), I enter the inner sanctum:  spacious and with dark walls, high ceilings, big paddle fans, and a bustling atmosphere.  A cheerful hostess greets my wife and I and takes us to our table.  The seating is comfortable, and the lighting is bright enough to read the menus but low enough to enjoy.  Our waitress, Tiffany, is a real joy.  She is very cheerful, checks on us just enough, and gets the orders correct.  She came out in short order and answers all our questions knowledgeably, and soon brings out the first golden nuggets of our meal: complimentary corn bread (they look like muffins without the tops).  They are delicious: very warm, melting in your mouth, moist, and with little pieces of corn in them.  The accompanying butter is hardly needed.  The menu, of course, focuses on meat, but for those inclined towards other proteins, there are other options: grilled salmon and shrimp  for example.  My wife order the baby back ribs with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies.  I got the grilled salmon, grilled veggies and pecan cole slaw.  I also had the \"homemade\" lemonade which came with free refills.  It was refreshing, but a bit on the sweet side.  I first got a side salad.  It was a decent size but basically iceberg lettuce with a few cherry tomatoes, croutons, shredded cheese and a little green pepper topped with red onions.  Warning: if you don't eat pork, they sprinkle bacon bits on top, which wasn't mentioned on the menu.  I got the blue cheese dressing, which didn't have lots of flavor but had real little pieces of blue cheese.  Soon the entrees came out, and they were good-sized.  My salmon was nicely seared and with a slight crispiness outside and very moist inside, served with a light sweet sauce on top.  The grilled veggies were green pepper, onion chunks, zucchini, and summer squash, served with a light vinaigrette.  Very tasty.  The serving size was about 1/2 cup.  The pecan cole slaw was good sized, with the right amount of mayo, and topped with the nuts (so if you are allergic to nuts, they simply can leave it off).  I wound up taking home 1/2 the fish and slaw and some veggies to make a lunch!  My wife finished off the 1/2 rack of ribs that she said just fell off the bone.  She took home some of the generous portion of mashed potatoes.  I tasted them: they were red skin potatoes with some of the skin in there and plenty of flavoring and very good.  While we had a generous meal, we felt for the benefit of our readers to press on and have dessert.  While \"Death by Chocolate\" cake sounded tempting, they were out of it, so we got Peach Cobbler instead. It came in a bowl: sliced peaches topped with a light pastry that was seasoned with the warming spices of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves (it seemed) and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Along with that we received the complimentary mini-doughnuts dusted with sugar and cinnamon.  Those melted in your mouth.  Tiffany gave us both two, but they never made it home!   Oh, and the Peach Cobbler was delicious, too!  Verdict: this is a great place for families and couples and anyone else as it is very welcoming and has great food to suit most tastes.  Except probably not if you're vegan.  I left it with a nice warm feeling all over and the thought that I would return.  Yelpers: there is currently a discount of 10% off the bill if you mention it.",

Not only was she incredibly friendly her knowledge of their menu was impressive!  While we sat inside due to the heat they do have a fantastic patio that I'm sure fills up quick during the patio friendly time of year. Inside there is a bar area which includes a few booths as well as a large open area restaurant.   We shared their brisket quesadilla off of the HH menu. It was very large and quite tasty. Brisket was very tender. They make their own guacamole which is served along side the quesadillla along with salsa and a bbq sour cream.  I had the (award winning) Smokehouse burger and was not disappointed. It was very juicy and had great flavor to it. I'm not usually a fan of barbecue sauce on my burgers but this burger is definitely the exception! I chose the mac and cheese of my side and let me tell you, the best I've ever had! Don't tell my grandma I said that!  I'm talkin stick to your ribs good. I'm drooling right now just thinking about it.  They also give you fresh baked donuts in your way out as a thank you. Warm and delicious, I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "The restaurant had a comfortable but classy kind of country charm.  There was a nice size bar area and people seemed to be having a good time watching the game on the two large flatscreen televisions.  The regular dining area was a large room with several smaller areas off of the large area.  There was a mixture of square, rectangular and round wooden tables and chairs.  While we were there I saw the staff moving some tables together to create dining for a large group of people.  The lighting was low, more like a bar setting, but adequate.  We had reservations, via Open Table & the Yelp app, and were seated immediately.    Our server was friendly and attentive.  We ordered two Strawberry Q'ladas, a strawberry flavored Pina Colada, off the speciality drink menu.  We got our drinks then he took our order and food was at our table about 15 minutes later.  The drinks were very good, but we both wished they packed more booze.  The cornbread was brought to our table after our drinks but before our meal.  Both grandkids had to have some right away.  Both gobbled down their pieces and probably would have asked for more if they could have gotten away with it.    The Baby Back Ribs were outstanding; falling off the bone the way they are supposed to be but hard to get just anywhere these days.  I also had the Pecan Cole Slaw and fortunately for me, the pecans were sprinkled on top so I could scoop them off and eat the rest of the really good slaw.  The Ranch Beans were pretty unusual.  I have not tasted anything quite like them.  My wife said they had cinnamon in them but there were a bit too spicy for me so I shoved them off on my grandson, the \"fire eating kid.\"  But I enjoyed what I had already eaten.  The cornbread was good but I really liked the super thin french fries I kept stealing off my granddaughter's kid burger meal plate.  My wife had the 8 oz Sirloin Steak and Baked Potato.  She asked that the steak be medium well and it was.  It appeared to be larger than 8 oz.  The potato wasn't as good as the steak; it could have been a little hotter.  It also came with a few thin onion straws that were a nice little surprise.  Before we left, we were surprised with some warm little donuts to take with us.  They were rolled in cinnamon and sugar and were just the right end to a delicious meal.  I asked the server if there was any chance the owners would open a location in Tucson because we would definitely be regulars.  But sadly, according to our server, both the owner and his kids are retirement age and the likelihood of a Tucson location appears to be extremely slim.",

Not a lot of flavor (has seasoning gone out of style?) and frankly the presentation was lacking as well.  So I waffled between a 3 and a 4 overall.

I called two days in advanced to make reservations for 6:30 pm. We arrived about 6:10ish pm and checked in. When 6:30 came around, we were told that the table was being set up. Returned back to the front at 6:45 pm and was told that a large party was finishing up. When we finally got seated about 6:50ish pm, the server took our drink orders right away and asked if we wanted to order any appetizers. One of the tables that they sat us at was not even with the other tables. The restaurant was extremely warm inside, it took a good 30 min or so for us to finally cool down. Throughout the dinner, we felt extremely rushed by the server to get us in and out. She was not personable at all and was training someone on top of that. Our family was still eating our food and the server asked us if we wanted boxes for the food. When I called to make the reservation, I was told that our party of 8 had a two hour limit. We were in and out of the restaurant within a little over an hour. The food was ok, nothing too special about it. I would not recommend this place for large groups, unless you want to feel rushed to eat your meal and get subpar food.",

Had ribs, chicken, tri-tip, slow cook pork and....something else PLUS two sides and corn bread. It was so good we said we must go back. A must try.  Odd location. Lower income neighborhood.

The restaurant itself is large and has a good amount of parking. The inside is very nice with dark lighting for a nice setting. We were there today about 2 o clock so it wasnt too busy but I can vet this place gets packed! They do have a bar and they had a nice fire oven that you could see chickens being roasted through the glass.   We tried the Q rolls for an appetizer and they were very good with the chipotle ranch dipping sauce. For an entree my wife tried the pulled pork sandwich and I had the sampler with chicken, brisket and ribs. Both dishes came with a side. We tried the mashed potatoes and gravy and the mac n cheese. Both sides were creamy and delicious! The meats in the main dish were very flavorful and the bbq sauce is good. We really enjoyed the corn bread and the donuts they give you for dessert.

We had several questions for the waitress regarding use of soy as an ingredient or cooking oil.  She had to keep going away to ask and the answers coming back were vague and not very helpful.  Not acceptable in these times.  Many people don't care, but soy is an allergen and one of our group has an intolerance.  We expect better of highly rated restaurants than to use soy as the cheap go-to ingredient in most of their menu.  Barbecue sauces can be made from real ingredients like cane sugar, tomatoes, vinegar, spices etc...   Ingredients like soy and corn syrup are a cheap sellout in my view.  With better ingredients and staff training this could be a really good restaurant.  If soy doesn't bother you, go for it.  The fresh donuts at the end are a great touch (soy there too).",

For dinner I decided to go with the smoked pulled pork, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese. It came out so quickly I was sure they were bringing me someone else's order! Literally five minutes after I ordered it was at my table, piping hot.   It was easily the most tender pulled pork I've ever had, and the BBQ sauce was just perfect. The mac and cheese wasn't be best, but it was still pretty delicious. The cornbread that comes with it was also great with a pat of butter.   After I paid the check, the waitress came over with a little bag of fresh cinnamon sugar donuts which I devoured, even though I was completely stuffed from my meal.

We were starving, so we ordered an appetizer and two huge platters (three meat and Hogs Heaven).  Whoa, it was waaaay too much food for all five of us (the kids ate off of our plates and they are big eaters). The portions are pretty darn generous, not to mention they give baskets of the best tasting cornbread I have ever tasted before your meal ever comes.  Our baby back ribs were moist and tender, and I am pretty sure that I ate the best brisket of my life.  The service was great!  Even though they were crazy busy, our server was very attentive.  A lady that seemed to be the manager also checked on us a couple times and brought us the delicious complimentary donuts at the end of or meal.  We will definitely return the next time we are in town.  Thanks for a great meal!",

I've been in the valley for 20 years and have passed this establishment many times a week, but never ventured inside. I can't believe all that I've missed out on all these years. The restaurant is really cool looking and has an outdoor patio. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation or you're be drooling waiting for a table if you can get one. We had a reservation last night and there was a line out the door of 6 people a head of us. When you go, ask to be seated in server Carissa's section. She is a spunky young gal who knows her stuff. She made valuable recommendations and has a winning personality. She will even sing for you!  She was every bit worth the 25% tip we left. The food is outstanding. I recommend the 2 rib dinner and get the Baby Back and St. Louis ribs. I was there for the BB, but the SLRibs were out of this world. We ordered a couple of dessert, but the warm donuts Bobby Q gives you at the end took the cake. All in all, eat at this establishment!  Carissa, we'll see you soon enough.",

We fed three and still took a box home.  The baby back ribs were succulent and tasty, and the St. Louis ribs were almost as good, but the brisket was to die for.

The service is another story, and if the head manager themselves don't care, no one is going to. If it was just one of the servers or something, that would be different - but the fact that the manager was not concerned, makes it a whole different take. Won't be eating here again b/c of that.

They looked at me wearing a pair of fitted jeans and said they were too baggy. As I said before my jeans were fitted! I'm not a high fashion person but I do have a pretty good idea of trends and My style is probably above the normal clientele.The fake ass bouncer at the door had baggier jeans then me and also let others with baggier jeans then me in. Mind you I was only there to spend time with my girlfriend and her sister who was in town, so I would never consider going to a low class dump on my own. At that point it became clear why I wasn't allowed to enter, was due to me being a young black man. I called the bouncer and manager out on it and they couldn't even look me in the eye when I called them out. I'm not someone who goes around pulling the race card bc I've definitely had to work my way up in the world and career wise , where I'm the single person of color in the room. This was down right bigotry exercised at the expense of what was supposed to be a nice evening with family and friends . I will say i did use some foul language which was simply reflective of how I was treated. I hope the owner would address this matter (clearly mgmt is not apt to)as the big board of rules they had up front was clearly targeting of one culture/race of people. I work to hard to earn my money and then be disrespected by two a-holes who couldn't even look me in the eye. Give me an answer!",

The Hostess was sweet and knowledgable and let me look around the lounge area and told me about the dancing and crowd.  We got seated pretty quickly even though it seemed crowded.  We went on a Sunday about 130pm.  The Server (Dana) was great.  She said she had been there for 8 years.  They bring you corn bread to start.  It was really good and very moist.  We decided to order an appetizer since we hadn't been here before.  We ordered the wings 1/2 & 1/2.  They were both amazing but the BBQ was so good, next time I would order all BBQ.  We ordered the Half Hog platter to share.  It was the Sunday feature so it was only $31.99.  It came with ribs, brisket, chicken and pulled pork.  It was all wonderful!!  It was a lot of food.  It said it feeds 2-4 people.  It is definitely enough for 4 people.  It also comes with choice of 2 sides.  We got the mac & cheese and shoe string fries.  The mac & cheese was so creamy and delicious!  The fries were good too.  The only negative I have to say is that they serve Pepsi products.  We will be going back a couple times per month.  And I might go one night to try the Salsa dancing.",

They started the meal with good (sweet) cornbread. Overall nice and clean atmosphere--the manager asked if we were okay several times. We got free tiny cinammon donuts at the end, a nice touch-.

End of story. But the vegetarian options (i.e. fish) aren't really that great. Another Con- the food takes forever! As i mentioned before, the decor is extremely corny and makes it feel like a chain restaurant. Pros include fabulous service/waiters, free donuts, AMAZING sides, and the fact that i feel really popular in there because it is always packed. Overall its a fun place, but nothing special.",

Portions are great and the taste is amazing.  We had q rolls and queso dip to start. I already knew I loved the q rolls, and while I liked the dip, it wasn't stellar (to me). My husband liked it though.  My toddler got chicken tenders with fries and seemed to enjoy it, though she liked the bread from the queso dip more.  I loved the Mac and cheese again, though my mother said it's not as good as her sister-in-law's...which I haven't tried, so I still love this one.  I also tried the ranch beans. While they were pretty good, they're not my favorite. Some seemed undercooked. My husband thought the same.   Nobody had room for sweets, so that's my goal next time!",

The free corn bread they bring out was so buttery and greasy I couldn't eat it. Next my girlfriend and I shared two entrees, the pork ribs with mac n cheese and fries, and the pulled pork with corn and cole slaw. The ribs were so fatty and the quality of meat was not up to par. The pulled pork had a nice flavor but made me feel very ill once I was done. The corn was a joke, it was super water logged and they left the unwanted part of the corn on top as a garnish.",

For $25 I got the steak and two sides and I found it to be a great value for a $25 steak. It is a step up from Outback and Texas Roadhouse, but about the same price. I sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive and friendly. One of my sides was the mac and cheese and I can honestly say that it was some of the cheesiest, and therefore some of the best that I have had.",

The cornbread was pretty good too, nothing like mom's but for a restaurant probably some of the best I had. The Mac and cheese was ok. Highly recommend if you have a taste for some bbq!",

But the 55 min wait was well worth it id wait it 3 times for the meal I've received . The meat on the rip steak chicken etc was just top quality and the way it is cooked in wooden ovens just tops it off . You can taste the quality and it really changes the way you look at food. This place man is one of a kind. After the meal I literally texted my brother and told him Lucile's is trash compared to this place. Don't sleep on this place .",

However, the service is excellent and all the waiters are very amiable. In addition to the feast, they treated us with fresh donuts that were delicious.

    "text": "Finding good barbecue is a challenge.  With barbecue, people's favorite styles are so different and standards are exacting.  Yelp put me onto Bobby Q.  Impressive ratings.  Rare does any restaurant have the ratings that Bobby Q does.  It was a Friday night during spring training.  We tried making a reservation that day, but they were already fully booked.  The parking lot was overflowing (at night you can use the lot next door at the small \"college\") when I arrived.  Loved the smell of smoke as I walked in.  The hostess said 50 minutes.  I don't think it was much more than 30.  Three of us started with Bobby's Amber Ale.  For those looking for heavy hops (IPA lovers) or deep flavor (stout or porter people), it would be lacking, but I liked it.  We also got the appetizer of little taquitos, Q Rolls, filled with barbecue beef.  Those came with two good sauces.  Very good.  For the meal, I choose two meats: pulled pork and brisket.  Both were tender, well seasoned, smoky, a little sauced (and I wasn't compelled to add a lot more), and moist.  Others in the group got: a pulled pork sandwich, ribs, and a salad with chicken.  Everyone thought the barbecue was excellent, echoing my comments of seasoning, smoke, and moistness.  Everyone loved the sauce.  Side: I got the Mac N Cheese and corn.  The corn was excellent with some taste of grilling and well seasoned.  The mac N cheese was good.  Mac N cheese almost always disappoints, and this was better than most, though I didn't love it.  Many in the group went for the grilled vegetables which were excellent.  An excellent meal.  I can imagine a few being disappointed with the crowds, the wait, or the style of barbecue if it's not their favorite.  I've been to a lot of barbecue places that were not nearly as good.  I haven't gone to any significantly better (except my backyard on 4th of July).  So I'm going to say 5 stars, and I look forward to returning to try the spareribs.  Why 5 stars?  Why not 4?  This is a barbecue place.  I'm not going to rate it on the same scale a high end fine dining restaurant.  For what it is, a steak and barbecue joint, it does it as well as any place I've been to.  I wish it wasn't as crowded, but it's popular.  If you crave smoke, you should find great satisfaction here.  The sides and appetizer were 4+.  But the star of the show, the smoked meat, was excellent.  That's what I came for, and that's what they get the 5 stars for.",

One of the few places in Arizona that serves Beef Ribs. Cannot over-emphasize this point..better than Claim Jumper..not even close. Beef ribs have twice as much meat as pork ribs but are much harder to find in restaurants.   They smoke all their meat on site and everything is super fresh. Melissa & Sawyer were fabulous and I really appreciated the 10% off for using YELP.   The only downside is that because we sat close to the chicken rack in the back near the kitchen we wound up smelling like a campfire. However we didnt really notice this until after we left and went back to the outside.   The cornbread starter and donut pastry ender was absolutely unexpected and refreshing.   Beef Ribs = $22.00 12. Oz Sirloin = $12.00 2 Non Alcoholic Drinks Total was $45.00 with 10% off..Extremely reasonable, high quality, totally full.",

The server, Hal, introduced himself soon after and had our drink orders on the table in minutes. He was a great server: personable, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and food recommendations. He was kind and patient with my mom, stopping to listen to her even though he was slammed with full tables to care for. We ordered ribs and fries and a brisket sandwich with roasted corn. The cornbread was amazing and our meals were out so quickly there was no lag in between. Our food was tender and flavorful, moist and just the right amount of delicious sauce.

That's fine,  just don't interrupt conversations at the table like what happened when I was there this weekend.  Yeah, it's your job, I get it but I was MID SENTENCE when I was interrupted by a manager to ask if everything was all right.  I lied and said, \"yes\" but I should have said, \"Yeah, everything was fine until you thought it was okay to interrupt me while I was talking.\"  Do your job, yes!!  Just learn some damn manners.",

When we arrived I expected to find a small dinner that served BBQ but the atmosphere was outstanding.  The place was packed which was a good indicator of the food.  When we ordered, our waiter, Bryce, was exceptional.  He was very knowledgeable about both the food and the cocktails and gave great suggestions.  He was very busy but stopped by to check on us often and went above and beyond as far as taking care of our table with a great attitude (how refreshing).  They way he described the food had me wanting to try everything. The food-the food-oh my goodness.  It was amazing.  We ordered the whole hog so we could try different items since it was our first time there and the three of us were not able to finish it.  Every time we took a bite we were like you got to try this it is amazing.  Everything became our favorite.  Bryce told us it would fall off of the bone and it did.  We had a hard time getting the meat to our plate because it was indeed so tender it fell apart.  We were completely stuffed but had to try the doughnuts.  Again, another favorite.  I am so happy we have found a new place to eat and will definitely be going back for atmosphere, food, and service.  Thanks Bryce for taking care of us.",

Our food came out and was hot, fresh, and delicious! The portions sizes were perfect, meaning my eyes are bigger than my stomach and they didn't disappoint, leftovers!!!!! I had the baby back ribs and the meat fell off the bone, clean...  the mac & cheese and the corn were seasoned just right. My dish was very flavorful. My daughter had the pork sandwich and every time she took a bite she groaned, keep in mind we eat out EVERYDAY for ALL of our meals & we are PICKY!! No complaints. The cleanliness of the bathrooms and dining room were excellent! Ann was very attentive and the manager even checked on us to make sure we were enjoying everything. Definitely on the top of our restaurant list! Great Food, Great Service.",

I've tried a lot of BBQ and wherever I travel I try to eat local BBQ . I usually can eat a whole slab myself and still have room for more , but not the case here. We ordered the prime rib brisket with Mac and cheese and shoestring potatoes  and the full slab of St. Louis ribs with Mac and cheese with shoestring potatoes . We were also offered corn bread  free of charge. The brisket melts in your mouth and is so moist and tender I'm drooling right now. Most briskets ive tried get dry and chewy but not here . The ribs had the right char on the outside but the meat falls off the bone with the right smokiness and moist flavor. It was so meaty and filling I only ate 1/2 the slab. The Mac and cheese is very cheesy and filling and the shoestrings were addicting. Asking for a doggy bag, tommy and Dylan added additional cornbread ,xtra BBQ sauce and a bag of fresh cinnamon donuts! Great experience and I'm going back again ! I usually ask for sauce on the side when eating meats to fully enjoy the flavor of the meat Do not drown meat in sauce",

Awesome and Oh so good. Well I got their chicken (and mind you I was ribbed out from munching on leftovers). My son and his dad got the ribs again and when they came with my order (the chicken) I was very very very disappointed. So bad that I was trading it for just a bite of the rib. My son liked it and thought I was crazy but it just looked like 1 breast or cut thigh. I was looking for a two pc or something. Oh well. I enjoyed the corn, the cornbread and the gravy.

    "text": "New to the area and found this place always looks busy when driving by on the freeway so looked it up on yelp and saw it was worthy for a try.  Well....in a word...\"underwhelmed\".  Should probably be one star.  It was extremely busy for a Sunday evening which I guess is a good sign and they seated me right away (party of one) so thumbs up there.  I ordered the wedge salad to start and what I got was a very cheap iceberg lettuce head with a sliced tomato and some cold greasy onion straws on the side.  See what I mean?  The menu made it sound like it was a specialty of the house!  Their \"homemade blue cheese dressing\" was more mayo than anything...couldn't taste any blue cheese in there.  Seriously, worse than a chain restaurant and a few dollars more expensive too.  The St. Louis ribs were an item that is particularly reviewed on yelp so I went for those with a baked potato and macaroni and cheese.  Taste was good, not spectacular but the real problem was the temperature...pretty close to room temp.  I knew I had been had by all the advertising for this place...more hype than substance.  The waitress asked how everything was and I started to say it was just ok and elaborate the problems but she quickly whisked away to another table.  I could tell she was working to the max so I let it slide.  Overall, a thumbs down.  There are a few other BBQ places in Phoenix so I'll look there next.",

With the amount of people waiting and from what we've read (and the distance we drove) we were definitely waiting. We didn't have to wait the full time. Our waitress was super knowledgeable about her stuff and got our orders taken and served in no less than 15-17 minutes (quite possibly faster!). The mana her walked around, seemed cool. Stopped to ask us how things were, excellent mister man! And then the complimentary sugar donut-churros sealed the deal and made me a fan for life! Try it out!!",

    "text": "I have a rule of going twice to any restaurant, today was the second time I went and boy was it an abysmal experience. The first time was amazing. The ribs were great and the service was alright. I left feeling positive that I found a new favorite restaurant. Today was the polar opposite. I ordered the steak sandwich and it was horrendous. I don't know what it was about the flavor but it started to make me really really sick. So much so that I had to get up and go to the restroom because I felt that I was going to vomit. Thankfully I didn't, I stopped eating the steak, which if you take out the flavor issues, it was cooked properly, and the texture was spot on.   Another thing which I found quite unprofessional was that the plate wasn't wiped.  It's not a huge deal but if you are a good restaurant you should show that when a costumer first sees the food. I got a mess of meat splatter and grease. I know it sounds trivial but the little things count. We eat with our eyes first, and it can totally change our experience from positive or negative.   Am I going to go back? Maybe, $18 for a piece of steak, garlic bread, and mushrooms is a steep price to pay for something that makes me sick.",

We had a party of  6 adults and 4 kids. Everybody got, just what they wanted, prime rib, rib combos, bugers and catfish. the food was terrific. That alone was worth the trip from Chandler. The service was the best I can ever remember, the waiter Cody was like Houdini. He would show up before you even thought of what you needed, very personable and made sure everybody got exactly what they wanted and kept the drinks  full all meal. This guy was a super star, and I'm really a grump if my glass is empty. He made a great meal a fantastic meal. The corn bread was a real kid pleaser and the  mac & cheese disappeared as fast as it arrived.  We are planning to be back soon with some friends and hope Cody is working. Well Done... Well Done!",

My wife is a vegetarian and there were not any entree options for her . Just side dishes which she has eaten  in the past .They started us off with there cornbread which was very tasty. I had the two meat entree with brisket of beef and the baby back ribs. My 2 side dishes were   a baked potato and the smoked baked beans which had  pieces of bacon and brisket in it. Very tasty.The brisket was a thick cut with a little barque sauce. Very tender and flavorful. The baby back ribs were so tender, I cut the meat at the bone and there wasn't a piece left on it.This was the first time I ever ate baby back ribs without getting sauce all over my hands and face. The ribs were succulent. We didn't want any desert but our waitress sent us away with these mini donuts which were warm and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. My wife loves warm baked goods.The experience we had was very good. Bobby Q passes the barbecue test with flying colors.",

Me and my friend put candy canes on peoples cars in the parking lot to spread cheer. Dressed in a santa hat and candy cane headband we walked into the bar and ordered one drink. After ONE drink the bartender told us he wouldn't serve us anymore. Mind you ONE and he took my friends second away. We weren't acting weird or anything!! We were talking to people around us handing out candy canes. We took the receipt to the manager and asked her why the bartender felt like he  didnt want to serve us. She stumbled on her words and couldnt give us an answer. I feel it may have been because i was wearing a HD shirt with tatoo sleeves?? Idk but WOW is all I can say. I will never step foot in that establishment again!!",

The lovely employee upon hearing our door troubles said we could come behind the counter and enter the dining room. What? We don't have to go outside again? Love her. She led us right to a perfect table and provided us with menus. Great service! Make it happen!  I was surprised and impressed by the upscale decor. Kind of reminded me of the House of Blues in West Hollywood...made to look like a shack from the outside but quite luxurious inside. Nice.   Our server Kellee was Killer!!! I wanted to snatch her away. Oops, I said snatch. Anyway, the pulled pork sandwich with mac n cheese was Bobby Q perfection as was Rickie's brisket sandwich with shoestring fries...the fries...so so yummy!

We showed up for lunch and were greeted immediately upon entering.  We sat outside on the patio and there were a few comments from my fellow diners about how comfortable and well decorated the place was.   The service was great.  Very attentive and efficient.  She was right on with the drink refills and did everything with a smile.  My brother had the pulled pork sandwich and managed to finish it, but just barely.  His girlfriend did the same.  I decided to try the sample platter consisting of sausage, ribs, and chicken.  I was not sorry.  The sausage was very tasty but wasn't overpowering.  The chicken was done with plenty of flavor and not at all dry.  The ribs were great as well.  I couldn't finish the plate so I get to enjoy the leftovers tonight.

I asked for double vegetables and got more broccolini than I could possibly eat. It was done perfectly with a tasty garlic butter. I had ordered the pulled pork and St. Louis ribs.

    "text": "I want to explain the 3 stars, loved the bbq brisket and sausage, awesome meal and great drinks, they were both a 5 star, but, the three stars is a result of poor service, appetizer came out before our drinks, that seemed a bit unusual since there was only 2 people at the bar and it was early and the house was not full. When the food came out there was a side missing on one meal, dropping down the 5 star rating, the waitress never came back to our table to check, we had to tell someone, I am assuming the manager who never introduced himself that came by our table to check our meal. We finished with an apple cobbler to go, after paying over 100.00 for the meal with poor service, we got home and decided to have dessert and the apple cobbler was about a 1 star at best. It wasn't completely cooked, apples or crust, and the crust tasted as though it was rolled on the same cutting board where the onions were cut. I really wanted to love this place, we lived in Tx for a while and love a good BBQ, but this was not worth the money or the drive, there are better out there.",

    "text": "2000+ reviews and rated nearly 5 stars? Why, yes please!  What an incredible experience. This was by far the best BBQ spot I've ever been to. Great ambiance, with both indoor and outdoor seating options, great service, a wonderful dinner vibe, and most importantly, the  best tasting food!  On a nice evening, I'd recommend, if possible, to sit at the outdoor patio.  Outdoor string lights cover the patio. It's sort of dim inside but with bright lighting above each table. Instead of waiting for a table, three of us sat at the bar. With a couple TVs, we were able to catch up on sports.  Among our group we ordered the beef brisket and ribs. When they say a full rack of ribs, you get a full, meaty rack. The sides included shoestring fries, grilled vegetables, roasted corn, sauteed mushrooms, and mac n' cheese. The mac n' cheese was the star side of the show while the ribs were the best I have ever tasted. When our food arrived, I was immensely in a better mood (I was already in good mood seeing how awesome the place was). When I tasted the food, I couldn't have been in a happier place. The brisket was delicious but clearly, the ribs are something truly special.  You get 10% off for checking in on Yelp. I forgot to use it but everything was so amazing I didn't care.  This place is highly recommended and I would absolutely without a doubt go to Bobby Q again.",

I had a three meat combo of St. Louis style ribs, pulled pork and brisket. The pulled pork didn't have much texture and was kinda mushy. The ribs were very tender and had a nice rub  to them. The brisket was a bit dry and needed a bit of sauce to make it good. The coleslaw was creamy but not too creamy and beans were pretty pedestrian. Overall what really makes this place is the atmosphere and the service, otherwise fairly average. Oh the donuts to go are a nice touch on your way out!",

We got the q rolls to start-they were fantastic!!- and got the whole hog heaven to share (this is a 3 day leftover meal for us) the ribs were so tender fall-off-the-bone, we were able to get fried catfish as one of our meats which was really good and not too fishy, and also got sausage which was not too spicy and perfect. My bf loves his bbq (especially Kansas city BBQ) and he claims that this was comparable to it. What really was the star of the show were the post meal complimentary sugar donuts. They were half baked with still chewy batter in them and were absolute fried pieces of heaven. We were able to get our waiter to get a dozen of them for us to take home with our leftovers. Great service and great bbq!",

The parking lot is covered in huge Eucalyptus trees so you can have shade on those hot summer days when you spend the next 1 to 2 hours of your life here haha. The BBQ here is delicious. The meat is moist and not overly wood tasting. I have had BBQ that had so much wood smoke cooked into it I was burping up the taste for the next 3 hours. Yuck. The potatoes are so good and the best part are the house made donuts in the brown baggies you get on your way out. He donuts are worth going here for alone yum! The staff is always attentive and it has a more upscale vibe. The outdoor area is shaded and has very tranquil water features so it is enjoyable to eat outside as well.",

We had on the rocks and it was perfect.",

This time I ordered a bbq brisket sandwich with macaroni, and the macaroni alone threatened to fill me up.  All five of my table took boxes home, maybe eating half the food from single entree orders.  Then they gave us free doughnuts to take home.  The restaurant tends to be loud, but the service is excellent ( shout out to Cameron F, who was on top of service tonight in a full house and never missed a beat, nor did he overwhelm). Well worth it!",

Tried the Q rolls which were delicious, but the chipotle dip was weak.  We both ordered chicken, and portions were huge!  Two meals each out of both entrees. My only negative comment is their prices for cocktails.  Vodka Paloma was $12!!  Way over priced.... only reason I didn't order a second.  Completely enjoyable evening!",

    "text": "It may be impossible to find good pit bar-b-q outside of Texas.  I'm still hoping, but have not found it yet.  Fair warning, I'm hard to please when it comes to bar-b-q'd brisket.  In Southern Texas, the pit master starts cooking at 10PM to have meats ready for lunch the next day.  I've heard a lot of good things about Bobby Q from family members.  Was able to stop for a Saturday lunch today.  Ordered the two meat platter with cole slaw and potato salad.    Nice attentive waitress brought out some cornbread muffins.  I grind my own corn meal and cook buttermilk cornbread in a cast iron pan I've had for twenty years.  Tough to compete with my cornbread.  These muffins have blenderized corn kernels to give them a little flavor.  They were the classic sweet cornbread.  Sweet with a little bit of canned corn taste.  Oh well, I came for the bar-b-q.    Sliced brisket and sausage was served on a platter with sides in small bowels.  Oh no!  There was sauce drizzled on the brisket and sausage.  It's almost heresy to put sauce on good bar-b-q.  Definitely an insult to the pit master.    The prime brisket was very tender.  Brisket is a tough cut of meat that has to be gently cooked for a long time to coax out the tenderness and flavor.  Even then it has to be cut across the grain to be tender.  These thick slices were amazingly tender.  There was no smoke ring.  Tender bland brisket.  The sauce was the star of this plate.  Crash and burn.    The sausage had grill marks on the sliced sides.  Reheating on the grill did not help the flavor.  It was a little spicy, but had very little flavor from smoking.   Again, the flavor was from the sauce that covered it.  Cole slaw had chopped pecans on top.  Nice touch as I love pecans.   If the pecans were browned in a little butter, it would have helped a lot.  Otherwise, pretty plain cole slaw.  OK, but not special.  I've had awesome potato salad.  This Bobby Q's version was OK.   Good, but not anything to write home about.    So, I continue to be a disappointed Texan.  Guess I'll have to invest in a smoker.    Go to Bobby Q's for good service, quality tender meat, and good bar-b-q sauce in a nice atmosphere.",

Smokehouse Burger was delicious and the Q rolls were something out of this world with chipotle dipping sauce. So much on the menu, so little time.

The only misleading part was it said grilled onions and came with shoestring fried onions but nevertheless they were tasty.

My wife got the chicken sandwich and I got the 2 meat combination plate. The chicken sandwich was sort of sweet tasting and the chicken didn't taste grilled. The 2 meats I got were the brisket and the baby back ribs. I got mash potatoes and broccoli on the side. Both meats has no smoke rings. Honestly they both tasted like they were put in a slow cooker. Yes it was fall of the bone meat but it fell off like it definitely was put in a crock pot or something originally. Not much flavor or smokiness. The BBQ sauce was okay but not for a BBQ restaurant. The broccoli was not cooked enough. The mash was okay.   Sorry, never coming back intentionally. Was very expensive for the quality.",

The bbq was great for chain restaurant quality but it's soaked in sauce, which might be great for some people but we prefer sauce on the side so we can actually taste the bbq and the meat. I've tried other bbq places in Phoenix that are better than this place.",

I always get the 14oz prime rib and it never disappoints. The sides that I order are usually their beer battered fries (which are not on their menu but highly recommend!) and their mac n cheese. You can make a meal out of their mac n cheese alone. It's completely thick and creamy.",

    "text": "A group of us visited Arizona over the weekend and this was the only spot in my bookmarks we got to try :( we made reservations for a Sunday at 7pm and when we all sat down the football game was just near ending. The energy was fun and loud- everything you expect from a bbq spot. My bf and I shared the whole hog deal ($56) based on reviews .. since I was the one who recommended this place, I recommended this deal for everyone (in pairs) and boy, we had full plates by the time we were all stuffed. In my opinion, this is a 3-4 people to share deal for the average person. Reviews said 2-3 but I would disagree. Nonetheless, we took home a bunch of leftovers and then forgot all of it in the fridge when we drove back to Cali. So those few ribs, brisket, and sides were all that I would get to experience and I can truthfully say, I am devastated. It was so yummy and the sides all made me happy. The price would have been great if we could have shared so that was our fault for over ordering and then forgetting it all.   Our waiter Johan was great. We have no complaints and he was really friendly and gave us the best tiny cinnamon donuts I've ever tasted and a few extra to go.. still dreaming about these :( would recommend to all my friends visiting Arizona!",

See my review for Bobby Q's Fillmore. I prefer the parking which is more than adequate. Other businesses compete for parking at Fillmore.  I had the spare ribs, I refuse to call them St. Louis style, and she had the pulled pork. This is the hardest place to write a review for because it isn't bad, but it isn't great. I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying either location.",

    "text": "Not sure why this place is so highly rated. I think it's just mediocre Q. Ordered the whole hog with baby backs, beef ribs, pulled pork and brisket. The baby backs were over cooked as you couldn't even lift them by the bone. The meat had no pull on it and just fell off the bone. Any bbq expert knows that ribs need a little pull and resistance to being completely pulled off the bone. The meat was of course mushy. That is not tender meat, it's over cooked. The beef rib was very good. The brisket was dry and not extraordinary. The pulled pork was not remarkable. Mac and cheese was really good. Corn had been cooked way too long. The donuts at the end of the meal were a nice touch. If you like bourbon you will be disappointed in the selection. The place gets super crowded so make sure you have reservations. But I'm sure there are better bbq joints in this town.",

Everything was delicious, the rib were literally falling apart and the steak cooked perfectly with the right amount of char (medium). The sides were also amazing, the mac and cheese is one of a kind and the loaded baked potato and cole slaw was delicious.  We definitely will be back to share more memories!",

Immediately seated, our waiter was attentive but not smothering, always coming back for refills.   The complementary cornbread is such a wonderful treat. While not the best cornbread I've ever had it certainly was welcome after a long day. It was light and crumbly and delightful.  I decided to go all out and order a full rack of baby back ribs. Even though my waiter forgot to give me a steak knife I didn't really need it. Now I realize that falling off the ribs does not make good barbecue, but it certainly helps. These were tender and succulent, the sauce was not slopped on and complimented the taste of the meat.   I got sides of mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. The potatoes were average, nothing special. The mac was buttery and cheesy as it should be.   It made a wonderful lunch the next day. The next time I feel like treating myself I'll make my way up here again.",

I feel like this is where most BBQ joints generally fail, but the side dishes complemented the main entrees well.  To wrap up the meal we ordered the bread pudding.

We started with Q Rolls. Delish. Then steak, baby back ribs and sliced brisket. It really is incredibly good barbecue. Very meaty ribs! The sides were also great (grilled veggies, pecan coleslaw, mac and cheese, potato salad...each yummy). The raspberry sangria was wonderful but the strawberry lemonade is a good non-alcoholic alternative. We left stuffed. But they sent us off with housemade donuts in a bag. Good stuff!",

We were in a hurry and let Christy know (I think she was the GM or Manager?) when we came in that we'd like to get in and out as quick as possible.  She put the wheels in motion for us to have a great lunch in a very short period of time.  In fact, my beer was on the table as they were seating us, which took about half a minute after we arrived!!!  Our server, sorry, I forgot your name, did and awesome job and immediately took our order so she could get it into the kitchen.  She hustled to get waters and their cornbread on the table all while we were still barely settling in.  To the kitchen, thank you for getting our food out so quickly and man was it good!  OUTSTANDING babyback ribs and pulled pork sandwich.  French fries, cornbread, everything was really good.  Fantastic job to the whole team and operation.  We WILL be back, hopefully less rushed next time so that we can really enjoy all that they have to offer!!  Chris and Family",

In about 2 minutes we were covered up in birds landing on the ground, on the chairs at our table and even on the table itself.  We got up and entered the building.  So....the food.  We ordered and split the sampler platter, with barbecued chicken, brisket and short-ribs.  All three were top notch.  Fairly good selection of beers, I enjoyed an IPA from Deschutes Brewery, something we don't see much of on the east coast.  Except for the outdoor experience, this is definitely somewhere to check out if you like BBQ.",

The backyard patio is beautifully lit, has a really cool waterfall, and there are mister machines on the ceiling which help on those really hot Phoenix summer days.  Their food was excellent! I had the big potato with brisket on top and a side of sweet potato fries. It was amazing! This we potato fries are seasoned with a hint of cinnamon which makes him quite... sweet. It was the perfect amount of food. The chipotle ranch sauce that came with the sweet potato fries had a zesty finish.  I would definitely come back!",

For my main entree I ordered the beef brisket and 1/2 rack St. Louis style ribs which was so tender and juicy. I had a side of mac n' cheese and the potato salad which complemented the meal very well. My guest ordered the triple meat combo which included pulled pork, ribs and brisket with sides of the pecan coleslaw and baked potato. Everything was honestly really good and I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a True barbecue experience! I also enjoyed the cute mini donuts they gave for dessert. I would also like to note that we had plenty of leftovers which was awesome!",

Honestly when the meal came, we thought Oh thats not alot...well, we brought home a packed box of leftovers.  Beef ribs were tender, juicy and sauced perfectly.  Baby backs were even better and the pulled pork was mind numbing.  Even the sides were delicious..good compliments to the meal not an after thought and plenty for 2 people.   Bbq ordered out is so hit and miss...BobbyQs was nothing but homeruns!!   This is definitely a place we will return to again and again...not only was the staff great, the food fantastic, the prices right....these people understand good Southern Sweet Tea. That tops it for me.",

One complaint was the size of the sides that came with platter. They were not big enough to share, we ended up ordering another side and we're shocked at the price of that single side. But overall we would definitely recommend and will go back.  We especially liked the spicy bbq sauce, the pecan Cole slaw, the brisket, and the baby back ribs.",

And when you finally do reach your  seat  your mouth will water and your  stomach will rumble because everything you've  heard is True. There food is that good.   As far as restaurants go, Bobby Q has the look of an old industrial factory with a touch of western thrown in. The interior is a combination of wood, steel, glass, concrete, exposed pipes, ducts, and wires. At first it may  look like everything was thrown randomly together, but everything fits in a modern organic way. The overall  effect is entertaining. Your eye drifts from one area  of the  room to the  next.   Now  the food. For lunch I had their combination platter consisting of the ribs, brisket, and chicken. And as expected, the food looked good. It smelled good. And it tasted even better.  It was hot. It was  tender. It was tastey. But what suprised me the most was the chicken. It held it's  own against against the ribs and mighty brisket.   For more info check out their  website. Or better yet, just go.",

However, the atmosphere was inviting and simple with warm lights, wooden tables, and old-fashioned decor. Our waiter, Austin, was very attentive and outgoing. He checked in frequently and was able to make suggestions because of his knowledge of the food (he had worked in the kitchen previously). There is complimentary cornbread to start, which just melts in your mouth. Our food came out very quick and every single thing was just to die for. My favorite thing was the rotisserie chicken and my boyfriend loved the brisket. Complimentary mini-donuts are also given with the check-yummy! Overall, this was a great place to go for out anniversary. I highly recommend.",

My wife and I shared the Whole Hog Heaven (48) it is a designed for 2, but it is enough food for 3 to 4 people.  every thing we got with it had good flavor.  My only complaint was the drink we order was a chocolate martini, sporting an Oreo cookie when served it was missing the Oreo,  Come to find out they where out of Oreo, now tell me if I am wrong but how hard would it to be if they went to the store and got a couple of bags of Oreo, or take it off the drink special sheet.  Now I will say when I said some thing to the manager walking around he did accommodate us and took it off the bill, but the reason I got the drink is because I have dip an Oreo in milk, but have never dipped in in vodka, I was bummed.",

Camden was one of the best servers. We were seated at a wobbly table at first Camden was more than happy to reseat us in another section without us even asking.  Food was promptly served.

We ordered the three meat platter and oh boy, it was good. me and my gf shared the platter, we got the st louis ribs, the brisket and the pork. the ribs were great, it falls off the bone and it's so juicy and tender. one of the best ribs i ever tasted, period. the brisket were unbelievable. smoked right, you'll taste every flavor of it. salty, meaty, and juicy, we were all happy just to be there at that time.  if you visit phoenix, make sure to visit BOBBY Q as it will never let you down!",

I'm from Chicago and grew up eating barbecue NOT pulled porked sandwiches or beef brisket, but pork barbecue ribs & rib tips from the south side of Chicago. Ya know, the kind where white bread and french fries are saturated in sauce at the bottom of the basket. Where you have to work a little bit to pull the meat off the bone. Where you smell the charred ribs a few blocks away. Now that's barbecue to me.  This does not mean that I cannot appreciate other types of barbecue. We spilt the pulled pork sandwich and slab of ribs. It was good, but I packed the leftovers for my husband's lunch today. When something is really good I don't share and sadly, the ribs we just okay.   I gave an extra star for the customer service. The hostess and waitress were polite, attentive and nice.

The shoe string fries love accompanying both(again no salt). The corn bread nicely introduces you, then the Q rolls or pizza with brisket fully loaded helps fill a section of your stomach up, and the entree knocks it out. This place has made it so that every other bbq place sucks lol. Go here order the ribs or burger and tell them to hold the salt. Enjoy",

Already a plus. Our server, Cameron, came over introduced himself and gave us a history lesson about the location on how their meals are prepared, which was very good to know. He suggested the Q-rolls for an appetizer and they were amazing. Our meal was outstanding, I had the fried chicken, my boyfriend had the 3 meat combo. Lets just saw we had to take doggie bags home lol. Then I believe the night manager, Lauren, came over introduced herself and thanked us for visiting. I have not been to a location that has such great customer service in such a long time like this. I've been in customer service myself for over 20 years and it's wonderful to see that an establishment like this one truly cares about their guests. Thank you and we will definitely be back.",

I started the meal with the Q rolls appetizer, let me say these are brilliant and amazingly good!! They are basically brisket egg rolls that melt in your mouth, so light and crispy with a ton of flavor!! I ordered the three meat combo with Pulled pork, Brisket and Baby Back ribs, my sides were the beans and the Mac-N-Cheese. Brisket was super moist and tender as was the pulled pork, Baby Backs fell right off the bone but didn't taste over done at all. Beans were good, not over powering as some Q places can make them, they are simple and good. Mac n cheese was creamy and super cheesy, didn't finish them because I was stuffed to the gills by then!!  The little donuts at the end of the meal are so good, I wanted to take a bucket of them with me! Service was great as well, Jason was my server and he did an epic job as I never went without iced tea, food was out quick and he was the one that talked me into the Q rolls. If I lived here I would be a regular for sure!",

The entree options are well rounded, there is something for everyone. The portions are huge, so be prepared! And at the end of the meal you are given a complementary mini donut covered in sugar.

    "text": "First time actually coming to eat dinner! Had a huge group of about 10, it was no big deal at all, we sat out on the patio, and had a blast! We started with drinks of course which they had a huge menu for drafts, that's a huge Plus! I ordered the Mojito and a draft, and let me tell you most people do not know how to make mojitos, this place absolutely does! ORDER THE MOJITO! We moved on and I think I ordered the full hog or something like that; they gave me like two styles of ribs, three different types of barbecue meats, and also three sides. That is a great deal! Two Hungry people could not finish it, so I would suggest ordering this if you have three or four great friends, it's only fifty bucks, and a Smokin deal! All the barbecue was fantastic, including the smoked chicken, I also added in addition the catfish, and sausage. The sausage was relatively spicy, so I would probably stay away from that, I like spicy stuff, but I just really wanted a nice meaty sausage and it really wasn't that. The catfish however was fantastic; I ordered it with lemon and also tartar sauce and that was pretty delicious as well. So we have great food, killer Ambiance, no big deal with a huge amount of people being served, waitress was absolutely excellent! So bottom line, if you're up for a great night of drinks, amazing food, and let me finish with this; HOT MINI DOUGHNUTS as a closer! Yep, it happened! No regrets! Check it out!",

The brisket was my favorite hands down. Meat is so tender almost melts in yours mouth. The baby back ribs had the bones falling off them when we were putting them on our plate! The beef ribs were more bone then meat and the meat was a little tougher...still had good flavor and I am glad we tried them but won't be ordering again. For the sides the mac and cheese was thick and my favorite...along with the mashed potatoes and we ordered gravy on the side! Yum! The pecan coleslaw was on point. The ranch beans were my least favorite item, the beans are a tad on the firm side and the sauce wasn't as sweet as I was thinking it would be. Maybe because of the ranch...won't be ordering again but also glad we tried them. The corn bread at the beginning was super tasty and the mini doughnuts at the end reminded me of back home MN state fair doughnuts!!! Overall, loves this place. A couple managers came by to check on how everything taste and I want to say maybe even the owner! I am not sure though I didn't ask him if he was....the waitress and the waiters were all on point. Awesome experience! Will be back!! :)  P.s. almost forget about the sausage! Perfect! The sauce on them was little spicy but just the perfect amount! That was my second favorite next to the brisket!",

This is literally the best BBQ restaurant I've ever tried... EVER. It's everything you'd want it to be and more. The service was great and I enjoyed the southern decor. We began our awesome experience with drinks at the bar as there was a little bit of a wait for a table. I got the Peach Tea and my husband got the Old Fashioned. Both were awesome! For dinner we split the three meat combo. We got St. Louis Ribs, Beef Brisket, and (Pulled) Pork. For our sides we chose grilled vegetables and the mac n cheese. OMG was it good. The meat nearly fell off the bones of the ribs because it was so tender and juicy. The pulled pork and the brisket did not disappoint either... but that mac n cheese, that was the best part! If you're a local or if you're just passing through, I'd highly recommend this place if you're looking for a good meal.",

Started with some great warm cornbread. Perfect size for a pre-meal snack...and just the right amount of sweetness.   I ordered the 3-meat combo, for only $3 more than the 2-meat...great value!  I weigh in at 315lbs...and I didn't even GET to the 3rd meat - way too full. I got brisket as one of the meats - honestly, tasted like it was right off the smoker...that's NEVER the case in BBQ joints, it's always dry and flavorless by the time it gets to the table - not here folks, may as well been eating it right from the pit. Very impressive.   Sides: hats off to the Chef, FINALLY...a BBQ place that has crafted their sides to be as good as their meats. And a special mention...the mac & cheese had great flavor! I also got the corn...tremendous. Can't wait to come back to try the other sides...  Energetic atmosphere, great staff, and tremendous food at a good value.   Thank You!!!",

    "text": "Unbelievable.  Our 1st time at Bobby Q's, the last night of vacation and we couldn't have been more impressed.  Our waitress (Christen?) started things off right with her friendly and warm style.  When my date wanted to know which sides were best, Christen brought out huge samples of the sides we were interested in.  Our glasses were never empty and our table was consistently bussed.  We chose the smoked wings for an appetizer and since we come from the \"wingland\" (near Buffalo, NY) we were not disappointed.  Big, meaty wings that were slathered in sauce and cooked perfectly.  We opted for small Caesar salads and were surprised.  The romaine was cold and crisp and the dressing was as good as any at many a high-end restaurant we've been to. Cornbread.  Damn, that cornbread was GREAT.  Then entrees:  I had the 3 meats: sausage, brisket and chicken.  Each was perfect.  Smoky, tangy and tender.  The brisket may just be the best I've had.  My date had the prime brisket and raved about it.  I was only offered the tiniest of samples from her but was amazed - that WAS the best brisket... ever.  At the end of the meal we remarked how terrific everything was (especially the cornbread) and asked for a box to take our remaining pieces to-go.  We were surprised when Christen brought out a box with an additional 6 pieces.  I had ordered the Sub Zero banana cream square to-go.  I was asked if it was ok for it to come out a little later, as the manager invited us back to the kitchen to look around and specifically to see the industrial-sized smokers.  That was an incredibly gracious gesture.  I even got some meat smokin' secrets out of him!  Again - a warm, friendly, gracious guy with a genuine smile and offered a feeling of being \"family\".  By the time we got back to the table my huge desert to-go was ready and we were fat and happy.  Christen ended our night with a warm (and strong) handshake and best wishes for safe travels, home.",

Of course the sausage was great too!  The mac and cheese side was the best I've ever had. It's no wonder it's their most popular item. It is the cheesiest and creamiest I've had and is absolutely addictive.   Speaking of addictive, the freshly made \"Tiny Tom\" (as I know them from back home) donuts covered in cinnamon are worse than drugs! :)",

We selected baby back ribs, St. Louis ribs, brisket and sausage along with potato salad, ranch beans and grilled vegetables. This meal is great for sharing! The brisket was my favorite. The ribs fall off the bone! At the end of the meal, we received complimentary mini sugared home made donuts, which are to die for! Can't wait to try Bobby Q's again!",

    "text": "I have wanted to try Bobby Q for years and finally had the opportunity with some friends. It's a really good place for BBQ!  I made a reservation (they get an extra shout out for being on Open Table) and it's a good thing I did. 6:15 on a Wednesday and the place was packed and many people waiting to be seated. We were promptly seated thanks to my reservation.   Our server came by to take our drink order and asked if we wanted any appetizers. Knowing what we would most likely be in for food wise, we skipped the appetizers and went right to dinner.   To drink I ordered sweet iced tea. $2.00 I love this stuff and order it wherever, whenever I can!    Though we skipped the appetizers, we did order salads which were really great, $5.50. Ranch house salad, my favorite type anywhere. Crisp lettuce, cheese, tomato, red onion and ranch dressing. Simple and delicious!   My friends split the Whole Hog Heaven platter. They could choose two kinds of ribs, two meats and three sides. They ended up ordering double ribs and double brisket. There was so much food that four people could have easily split it. $48.00  Being a prime rib fan, I had to go for it. I ordered the smoked 10oz slab $26.00. It was outstanding! I was a little afraid the smoked flavor would overpower the meat...Not at all. It was just right. My entree came with two sides so I had mac and cheese and potato salad. Both outstanding!   Dessert was tempting as mud pie was available which I would normally go for. There just wasn't room after all that food! We did however receive a complimentary bag of mini doughnuts. Served hot and dusted with cinnamon and sugar. Delicious and just right. You can take those home if you want.   Everything about our evening at Bobby Q was outstanding. We were taken very good care of by our server and management checked on us a couple of times. Special shout out to one of the managers on duty Donnie. He was very friendly and went above and beyond to make sure we were enjoying our evening. Nice touch!   Be sure to try Bobby Q! It won't disappoint! Look for the Mesa location opening soon!   Enjoy!",

    "text": "My family and I decided to visit last night.  This was my third time and their first.  What can I say that has not already been said in previous reviews.  We knew to arrive early on a Saturday (4pm) with reservations for 4:15.  It was just starting to become busy with about 50% tables filled.  Our server was AJ.  Very knowledgeable and attentive.  Made excellent recommendations. We started with those little Q-rolls.  A meal could be made of those alone but we restrained ourselves.  Egg roll type dough wrapped around BBQ beef with Chipotle and bbq dipping sauces.  Yum.       My family had beers.  Not a beer drinker myself but they have a good selection.  I had the frozen lemonade which was excellent.  Only change I would make would be to leave the sugar off the glass rim because it falls off and makes everything sticky.  Not enough paper napkins at the table to dip into the water glass to try to clean up the sugar mess.    Main meals were outstanding.  Between the 3 of us we had sausage, brisket, fried catfish, and 3 orders of baby back ribs.  All were fall off the bone, tender and flavorful.  The catfish was a crispy breaded boneless fillet, perfect size. Extra BBQ sauce was brought to the table by AJ.  Spicy and mild.  Combining the 2 brought on an extra depth of flavor.    Our sides were cole slaw, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, ranch beans.  All were excellent, especially the mac and cheese which had a nice little kick to it.  At this point we decided if we didn't stop, we would need help getting out of the restaurant.  But we could not leave without those little bits of heaven, hot donuts.  Fresh off the donut machine they are a perfect ending to the meal.  Did I mention leftovers?  We took enough home for all of us to have 2 more meals each.       Staff is very attentive.  Managers visit each patrons table to meet and greet.  Staff very friendly and upbeat.  Seem to genuinely enjoy working there.  100 best restaurant award well deserved.  Congratulations.",

My wife and I went back for dinner again just a few days ago and again was met by Taylor and friendly employees Taylor again was very professional and made us feel very welcome and the waitress was awesome I don't remember her name but she was great.

    "text": "One line: Excellent Steak and BBQ Ribs, good portions, MUST GET the Mac N Cheese!  Bobby Qs is one of the best BBQ joints that I've eaten at.   Reservations: Open Table or you can call in. We were running late b/c of the 101 closure so we called in and they were willing to push our reservation back for us.   Parking: Two private lots. They even have a guy standing outside to direct you to the second lot if the main lot is getting full.   Drinks Ordered the Bobby Q seasonal draft beer and my friend ordered a drink the waiter recommended: some mixed drink that came in a pineapple. Both were good. My friend really enjoyed the novelty of the pineapple.   Food - Both Entrees 5 Stars We ordered the two ribs combo and chose St. Louis and Baby Back ribs. The meat on both was fall off the bone tender. I think I prefer the St. Louis ribs though. They seemed to have a little bit more flavor. The spicy and regular BBQ sauce that they served on the side was excellent for dipping the meat in.   We also ordered a 14 oz. ribeye steak. The aged steak was also really tender.. the kind of melts in your mouth deliciousness. They didn't season it with very much so it is an excellent steak if you enjoy the unadultered taste of meat. The quality of meat here is indisputably excellent.   Sides: Mac N Cheese(5*)- MUST GET! The cheese was unbelievably creamy. I'd recommend that everybody choose this for one of their sides... so good that you really don't want to share.  Shoestring fries (4*)- good crisp fries to dip in the bbq sauce Roasted corn (3*) - my friend really liked the roasted corn.. i thought it was just roasted corn. Mashed potatoes (2*)- tasted a little too processed, too smoothed... I think I would have liked a little gravy but at the same time it was too salty and galicy.     Service: (4-5*) Just the right amount of attention.  Our server Daniel was really attentive and had some good recommendations, e.g. the drinks and mac n cheese. They were also pretty good about keeping the water glasses full. I guess part of the goal of the restaurant is to have the manager visit each table... which she did. It was very brief but I guess it shows an extra level of service?  I'd also say the service was excellent b/c I forgot my hat and they set it aside for me at the hostess area to be picked up the next day.  Little weird: On the check the pre-calculated/recommended  tip amounts were 18%, 18%, and 20%. I just found it odd that they didn't include the 15% mark and they included 18% twice.    This place is a little pricer... but well worth it if you got the cash.   P.S. Apparently there is some club/lounge in the actual restaurant. The decor, candle lighting and everything was right... the only detraction was the loud music and bass that could be heard through the wall. It wasn't unbearable but if you're here on a nice date you might want to request to be seated away towards the left side of the dining room.",

    "text": "Truly the best restaurant bbq I've ever eaten.  I do not give 5 stars unless it is truly deserved. ;) I'll be honest, I first went to Little Miss Barbecue today but I didn't want to wait in line and not even know if they would have what I want to order by the time I get to the front so I looked for a highly rated bbq restaurant close by.  I wasn't excited to drive 15 minutes more but I decided to take a chance and I am so glad I did. Bobby Qs is amazing BBQ! The ambiance is impress a date worthy. The food is delicious. Our waitress was so nice and her service was on point. We ordered the Q rolls as an appetizer and a three meat combo with mac & cheese and potato salad. Every bite was delicious.  So I had to try the banana cream pie for dessert. It was all to die for. I wanted to call \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" or \"DDD\" and tell them they missed one! The St Louis ribs are perfectly seasoned, fall of the bone, smoky deliciousness. The brisket was juicy, thick cut, with just the right amount of bark on it. The pulled pork is tender and delicious. The sauce was just as good as the meat. The menu prices are similar to other BBQ restaurants of this caliber. I definitely recommend giving Bobby Qs a try",

Get the hog heaven to sample the goodies. The brisket is super tender. Mac n'cheese is too cheesy...eat sparingly. Got the bacon/mushroom burger after overhearing the waiter serving the adjacent table rave about it. Meh...It was just a burger. Stick with the ribs and brisket. Ask for both the mild and spicy BBQ sauces.",

My wife and I easily share entres with food left to go.  Flavor is smokey in a good way.  Of course the meats are very tender from slow smoking.  The wait staff tends to be on the younger side, so may get terrific service or marginal.  Management and kitchen seem to be more consistent than the wait staff.  But, don't let this keep you from the restaurant, the food and atmosphere are tops.",

Ribs were incredible, and their sides are amazing. Great portion sizes, and you get a lot of food for their prices.

I'm not a huge mac n cheese fan but ordered it based on our waiters suggestion. Glad I did. It was great. Our son had the roasted corn and said it was great too. He had the pulled park and brisket. He liked both. Hubby had baby back ribs and loved them as much as me. The cornbread was excellent too.  We were stuffed and then came the little bag of heaven. The meals ends with the most amazing little cinnamon and sugar donuts. Can we get a few more of those bags to go? Great service, great food what more could you want?

    "text": "While we were in town, I had a hankering for some ribs and thought I'd try this place based on the many positive reviews it garnered.  Location & Aesthetics - Located just off the I-17 somewhere I believe in the Glendale area of Phoenix.  Lots of available parking in an enclosed private lot.  The place has a rustic look and feel to it.  Very spacious inside, clean including the bathrooms, and well lit.     Menu - menus were quite extensive though my wife and I already knew what we wanted as we had a chance to review their menu online before meeting our friends there.  Menu was self-explanatory and easy to find what one needed, not too overwhelming.  Service - The staff was very friendly.  We were greeted immediately upon entering and was shown a large table to accommodate my wife and I including our friends who had two boys with them.   I did have a gripe with the table we were seated at as it was a bit wobbly and thankfully my wife noticed too.  It wasn't too bad to shift our meals around so no loss on the ratings.   Before the meals are brought, they do serve some cornbread with butter in the meantime and though I didn't try it, my wife said it was tasty, delicious, and not too dry or too greasy.  Food - I ordered the full rack of baby back ribs with vegetables and roasted corn.  Initially when I first saw the full rack of ribs I thought I wouldn't be able to eat it but I surprised myself.  My ribs was well cooked and was practically falling off the bone.  It was soft, tender, and juicy and you could even taste the smokiness to the meat.  The roasted corn was well seasoned, more than enough and came in a bowl.  The roasted vegetables that I ordered was lacking and only consisted of a few vegetable that looked like it was about a tablespoonful.  (-1) My wife ordered the three-meat dish and it was so much that we had to take a bag back to the hotel.  She did comment on how well and delicious it was.   Rating - 3/5.  The restaurant loses another star/rating based on a small issue.   After the bills were brought to the table and the waitress ran my credit card, I asked if I can use my Yelp coupon and she stated that I couldn't do so as \"the card had already been run\" which I don't believe.  I couldn't see why she couldn't cancel it and re-run the card with the coupon. (-1) Despite the 3/5, it's definitely a place I'd like to come back to try some of their pulled pork sandwiches which is what my friends had and looked absolutely delicious!",

As we walked up I was a little surprised at how dressed many of the people were.  They looked like they were going out clubbing.  Turns out, there is a night club/bar attached to the restaurant.  Seems many of the club goers had dinner then moved on to the club.  The club in no way ruins the dinner experience and you can never hear the music or even know the club is there.  The food was very good and the service was excellent.  We were a party of 9 and we were assigned 2 waiters.  If you are Gluten Free all of their sauces are GF and they have a GF menu.  Only bummer is that they don't have a GF version of their cornbread.  The meats are tasty, tender and juicy.  The sides are all generous portions and good.  All 9 people got different items and no one was disappointed.  For the non-meat eaters there was a good selection of seafood.  I will return on my next visit to AZ as good bbq is not always easy to find.",

Then came the cornbread  -  that's when perfection got started.  I ordered the three meet dinner with brisket, sausage and baby back ribs.   Damn so tasty all falling of the bone so tender.   Two sauces mild and hot.  My glass never empty.    Manager came by after to check on us-- she was just  awesome.   Ordered a dozen cornbread to take home.   Then they bring us a little bag of hot cinnamon and sugar donuts  -- perfect surprise.  These guys know BBQ.  Definitely best overall in Phoenix!!   Do it!!",

Every single meal has been exceptional and our out of towners are blown away by the ribs and chicken.  There's a reason this is one of Yelp's Top 10 for Phoenix!  I've never had tender, juicy ribs like they make in my life.    And every time we have to bring a side dish to a friends house for dinner, we pick up a pan of the Mac n Cheese and some corn muffins.  We're the most popular people at the party!  I'm thankful this little gem of a place is only a few miles from me!",

This visit made me wonder why I gave up meat for almost a year of my life. They may want to reconsider a name change to flavor town because your taste buds are ambushed by an abundance of flavor from every which way. I had the Jumbo BBQ Potato topped with brisket and a side of Mac n Cheese and it was phenomenal! I can't remember the last time I had a meal this enjoyable and delicious where I savored every bite. The brisket was cooked perfectly, little to no fat, juicy, tender, and flavorful. The barbeque sauce was full of flavor, not too thin, not too thick, and it had the perfect amount of tang to it. The Mac n Cheese was full of cheesy flavor. It went really well when paired with the barbeque sauce. I poured a little over the Mac n Cheese to give it a little extra flavor. The place was packed and they said we had about a 45 min wait and ended up waiting only 15 or so minutes. The service was great as well. I can't wait to go back!",

I wanted a taste of that savory aroma passing through my nostrils. I've been budgeting and not going out to eat so much but today I was celebrating a personal accomplishment and thought \"why not?\" I'm so glad I stopped by for lunch. Once entering, the friendly staff showed me to a table, where the bartender-didn't catch his name, but was EXTREMELY friendly and helpful- suggested the sampler. In a sampler you get 3 meat options, 1 side, and cornbread. I ordered the ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and mac&cheese as my side. Service was quick and prompt, and let me tell you, those were probably the best ribs I have ever had. The brisket was flavorful, yet missed the mark a little there regarding texture though it was a bit tough(which is the reason for 4stars, not 5). Pulled pork was simply delicious. And the mac&cheese was super rich! I loved every bite! I did not leave empty handed either! fresh from the kitchen 1/2 dozen cinnamon sugar doughnuts right out the door. This place is so welcoming and delicious I wouldn't mind coming again with a party.",

We had a reservation - and I'd sure recommend it for dinner - and were seated right on time.  Think we were in the main room, back by the take-out room.  A little noisy.  Very good waitress.  Cornbread was amazing....next time that's all I'm going to order.   Ok, down to deciding.  I guess my main complaint was that nothing tasted particularly smoked.  The brisket was good, but if it was smoked as long as they claim, there should have been more smoke - there was just a narrow, light ring. The sides were excellent.  The wine was good, the people were very friendly.  I will go again...want to try it for lunch.  So I've decided.  Next time I really hope it's a 4 or 5.",

    "text": "I was born and raised in Texas, so I have been searching for good barbeque in Arizona since I got here a couple years ago.  This place is the real deal, and SO much better than the crappy chains like Dickey's.  I came in for lunch last week and got a cup of the ham and bean soup to start with.  It was yummy!  Delicious broth, plenty of thinly sliced ham.  I also ordered the sampler lunch of baby back ribs, barbeque chicken, and spicy sausage, with a baked potato as the side.  The ribs were heavenly, I didn't even bother to pick them up because the meat just fell right off the bone so I used a fork.  Perfect with zero gristle.  The sausage was pretty good, a little dry but nothing to frown about.  The chicken was okay, but barbeque chicken isn't really my thing, I only ordered it for variety because I didn't want three pork dishes.  The corn bread that comes on the side is pretty good, it's very light, somewhat sweet and falls apart as you pick it up.  The baked potato was alright.  Coming for lunch here is definitely the better deal,  the three meat sampler was maybe $12 (sorry I can't remember for sure) and came with one side plus cornbread.  The three meat sampler at dinner is $21 with the same amount of food except you get an extra side.  Pretty criminal if you ask me.  So even though the bartenders at dinner are really lovely, I'd rather come in for lunch and pay half the price for the same amount of food.  As a bonus they also give you a paper bag of fresh mini cinnamon-sugar donuts with the check, although good luck finding room for them!",

You should too!   Once we did have our table our waited was a adorable 20 something guys who was absolutely attentive. So much so that when the manager strolled through checking on guests I probably raved about the service more than the food.   I was with three of my sons who are 12, 9, and 3. My little ones had the mac and cheese. It was super excellent.   My older son had the pulled chicken BBQ sandwich and I had the pulled pork. I ordered the coleslaw for my side since I like it on my BBQ. The pecans in the slaw are a stroke of genius.   Cornbread is served that is very good while you are waiting for your meal. We also got the QRolls for an appetizer. My boys loved them. I thought they were OK.   When you leave they give you a little bag of cinnamon donuts that are made in a little machine up front. The idea is cute but the donuts aren't good. They were actually kinda gross!  At the end of the day it is all about the sauce and the sauce was very good!   I would skip the cornbread (even though it is free). It actually spoiled my appetite. I would skip the much praised QRolls too. The pulled meat sandwiches and slaw were worth a visit if that is what you might be craving!",

I wasn't sure what to expect as I didn't remember any of it. I was excited to see how good the BBQ was and to support a local place.   FOOD: We ordered the \"Whole Hog\" which comes with 2 types of ribs (your choice), 2 types of meat (your choice), and 3 sides (your choice). This sampler platter was $55, but a great trial for three people. The food only took about 15 minutes to be prepared and brought to our table. Holy cow it was a great feast! My personal favorite from that meal was the St. Louis Ribs. Those ribs were cooked to perfection and fell off the bone with amazing flavor. The sausage was also extremely delicious with a hint of spice. The sides we chose were mac & cheese, baked beans, and roasted corn. All of these were exceptional and well worth it. The food alone will have me coming back to try other menu options.   SERVICE: Our server was Dustin. He was a really nice guy who knew a lot about the menu and how all this great food is prepared. One of the people in my group had a dairy allergy, and Dustin was able to help accommodate us on what we could order. I was really impressed with the service and how friendly everyone was.   OVERALL: Bobby Q shocked me with their delicious food and exceptional service. The ambiance of this restaurant makes you feel right at home with a southern BBQ style vibe, and food that is to die for. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the valley who is looking for a great BBQ place to try.",

I have a hard time finding reasonably priced BBQ where I live, so this was an impressive treat.   The Restaurant Just wow. The design of this place feels like it should be on the cover of Home Magazine. It feels like a dream in both its indoor and outdoor seating. It's the kind of charming decor you just have to come to see for yourself.   The Service These servers really know their menus that's for sure or at least ours did! Dustin was our waiter and he didn't need to question the menu. I have an allergy that is in just about everything and he didn't skip a beat knowing his ingredients which I greatly appreciate. He was friendly, upbeat and checked on us just enough. The food arrived quickly and the hot cornbread even quicker.  The Food We ordered the Whole Hog to split between 3 people. We don't eat a ton of food but we definitely don't skimp out on portions when it comes to BBQ. The meal portion was plenty with some to spare. We chose the sausage which was super tender and packed with flavor and two different kinds of ribs that were to die for. I asked for some extra sauce and a toasted bun, and Dustin brought the bun with practically a pitcher of BBQ sauce (new best friend). The sides we ordered were the roasted corn, baked beans, and the mac n' cheese. I could only eat the beans which were fantastic, and the other two people loved their sides as well. The Whole Hog that comes with the three sides costs $52 and between 3 people that is more than reasonable!  Overall I will most definitely be coming back here! I would love to try the outdoor seating next time because it's so beautiful and I know the food won't disappoint. I don't rave about restaurants often but I'll be spreading the word about this place to everyone I know who is looking for a fantastic BBQ restaurant. Thank you for a wonderful dinner!! My photos just don't do the food justice.",

She was the best waitress we had in Phoenix. Hands down, my favorite. She was the best from start to finish.   On to the food, I love the cornbread, Q rolls, brisket, and donuts. Everything was delicious. I'm kind of jealous that we don't have a Bobby Q in Los Angeles. I will be hoping and praying they will open a location here one day soon.   Cornbread is the way it should be. Moist and crumbling. One of the best I have ever tasted. My favorite dish would have to be Q Rolls! If you ever visit Phoenix, do not leave there without trying this dish. Q roll is a tortilla rolled up that is stuffed with smoked prime brisket. The fried on the roll is like no other. You dip your Q roll into their chipotle ranch sauce. Amazing. I can eat this for the rest of my life. They need to find a way to sell this at Cost Co. cause I need a bulk of this.   Brisket was tender. Super soft. Super tasty. Lastly, you get a bag of cinnamon sugar donuts at the end of your meal that ends the meal perfectly. The donuts are made right up front. Very fresh.   Bobby-Q, I would fly to you ever chance I get!",

The ribs were nicely smoked, but definitely not enough sauce, so ended up more dry than desired.   The redeeming quality was the service. Everyone was nice and attentive, so that's always a pleasant experience.",

She immediately put the baseball game on for us, got our drinks, had our appetizer come out quickly and took our order right away!  Not the usual at most bar tops in restaurants.  Hubby had catfish po'boy, he really enjoyed it, and I got a half side of baby back ribs.  The ribs were perfect.  We also got the \"sweet onion block.\"  Oh, that is GOOOOD!  If you like onion strings, be sure to get it.  I had a loaded baked potato and roasted corn.  Husband loved his side of potato salad, plus helped me with my plate.

We had a reservation so they should have planned for the number of servers needed.    Started off with very slow and inconsistent drink orders.    Cocktails were served in waves and not even in the order ordered, incorrect cocktails brought to the table.   Not a good start to dinner.    I thought I was settled on the brisket since the reviews raved about it.  Decided to try the prime rib instead and just taste the brisket off someone's plate.  After waiting about 45 minutes for our order, half of the table was completely finished with dinner by the time the other half received their food.   Both the prime rib and the brisket were both rather disappointing.     The best thing served was the free corn bread.",

The house cornbread and donuts are a nice specialty and help offset the high prices. The outdoor seating was enjoyable as it was springtime and too hot. Service was friendly and timely.

    "text": "We chose Bobby Q for our first dinner, on our first day of vacation in Phoenix.  The Yelp reviews were great, and it was located just across the street from our hotel.    We arrived at 6:00 p.m. on a Thursday evening to a busy dining room.  We were seated quickly and our orders were taken within a few minutes.  I order the Southern Fried Chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy (a known weakness of mine), and mac n cheese.  My wife tries the pulled BBQ chicken sandwich, and coleslaw.  My son orders \"The Perfect Hamburger\", and mac n' cheese.  Cornbread is provided as a free appetizer and is solid.  The food arrives after a reasonable 20 minutes and is mostly very good, and in some instances \"great\".  My Southern Fried Chicken was perfect and was the best execution I have tried of this dish.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were very good as well as the mac n' cheese.  My wife did not care for her pulled BBQ chicken sandwich and barely touched it.  Flavor of the BBQ sauce and the texture of the chicken just didn't do it for her (my son tried it and also had the same opinion).  Her coleslaw was good though.  My son's \"Perfect Hamburger\" surprisingly was perfect, as advertised.  Said it was the best burger he has had - EVER.  This is a kid who eats a lot of burgers, so that comment was surprising to mom and dad.  He also liked his mac n' cheese, but commented it was almost too rich.    Non-food related comments: Volume was just right - loud enough to know something is happening, quiet enough that you can converse without issue.  The lighting and atmosphere were good.  The indoor and outdoor dining areas were both very nice - much better than my picture indicates.  Service was very average and forgettable - couldn't pick our waiter out of a line up if my life depended on it.  Overall, a very good experience.  I'll be back for the southern fried chicken on my next trip to Phoenix.  My son lives here and has vowed to come back next week for another \"Perfect Hamburger\".  Check this place out; it is well worth the money.",

Super tender melted in my mouth I opted for the French fries as my side dish they were cut in thin strip and fried to perfection good Chardonnay wine list I was very impressed as I thought yay just another so called bbq joint boy was I wrong looking forward to dining at Bobby'q soon and the service was great",

    "text": "I'm addicted to this place. The meat just falls off the none, the sauce is fantastic, most of the sides are great, and the service is always friendly.  Finding this place can be a bit of a challenge, I've found that using the frontage road to get there almost always ends in a u-turn but well worth the difficulty. And this place can get packed so definitely make reservations, even if you're a small group.   There is plenty of room for large groups, though it is really loud and very crowded on weekend nights when the connected club is open. I have yet to check out the Q-Lounge but it looks fun!  I always get the Q-Rolls, which are like southwest brisket filled eggrolls of joy with a side of chipotle aioli. They offer tons of meal options, including ones that are great to split even with more than one person. Their brisket is delicious and their shredded pork is great but its their ribs that leave me wanting more for days to come. The meat just falls right off the bone and I can hardly finish more than 3 of them before I'm stuffed. I happily eat the left overs for days!   They also have great sides, their corn and mashed potatoes are definitely my favorites. Their roasted veggies do leave a bit to be desired flavor-wise but the portion is still large. When you're seated, the table is given corn bread and butter which is so good, you have to remind yourself not to fill up before your food even gets to the table! And when you leave they give you a small bag of donut holes! Seriously this place makes you feel like family and makes sure you leave stuffed.",

Brisket Sandwich: Both my friend and I ordered the same main dish and both of us had the same reaction. The brisket was pretty tender but the flavor underwhelmed us. It wasn't bad at all, but again, I'm a super picky with BBQ. I wanted the brisket to ignite my taste buds with the flavor of the cut. It had flavor just not in the way I was after.   Roasted Corn: This was pretty good. It's a grilled and well seasoned piece of corn on the cob. Once it's done, they cut the corn from the cob, put it in a dish and serve it. It's a good BBQ side.   Beans: My friend had the beans and enjoyed them.   Service: Friendly, timely, attentive. The food was hot and served in a timely manner.   Summary: A nice spot for a casual dinner, date night or even a laid back business meeting. Food was good and atmosphere was inviting. Would consider going again if I was in the area.",

We visited again on a busy Saturday night around 6pm and from the moment we sat down our exceptional waiter Bryan made sure we received outstanding service. I ordered a full slab of baby back ribs and they arrived hot, juicy and very flavorful. The portion of ribs was so big I ended up taking half home. My wife ordered the top sirloin medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. Again, a big steak that only got half eaten and the rest brought home. There BBQ sweet sauce is exceptional...try it! Save room on the way home in the car for the extra special treat of a little bag of donuts given to you when you leave!",

To be honest, I'm not a huge bbq eater. I will eat it but it's not typically something I seek out but I can guarantee that I will eat here anytime I'm in town. The corn bread was exceptionally good and the appetizer (I forget the name but it was basically like a brisket filled egg roll) was delicious. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and mac and cheese and I totally could have licked the bowl after I finished the mac and cheese. It was all so good. The server was amazingly friendly and helpful too.

I say this because I'm not big on Barbecue, I'm not the rib or the brisket eater, so this review is based on the overall opinion of everyone in my party. Let's start with my Southern Fried Chicken, for me it was a bit disappointing, mainly because I didn't realize that it was going to be a boneless chicken breast (I blame myself for failure to pay attention to the menu description), it was very well cooked & seasoned, but just okay. I especially enjoyed the cornbread as did everyone at our table, so I do recommend the cornbread. The grill corn was good, but tasted a little like can corn. The Rib eaters absolutely loved their ribs and the brisket eaters had mixed emotions",

I cannot say enough about the amazing corn bread, selection of drinks, atmosphere, and staff. This quickly became a favorite place.  We lunched on the patio, each with a local draft beer, the lovely cool mist and waterfall along with the overgrown vines draping over the patio added to the really western feel. This is a wonderful place to dine and the food is outstanding. Well done!",

    "text": "Bobby Q was our first stop after leaving the airport when we arrived in Phoenix and it left one helluva impression! We came by in the early afternoon on a beautiful Saturday and there was zero wait which is perfect because we were starving. We had the choice of sitting outdoors or indoors but chose the latter because not only was it warm out but I saw customers sitting outside swatting flying bugs.  We ordered the whole hog heaven which is a platter where you choose two ribs, two meats, and three sides for $48. With the help of our waitress we decided to go with the baby backs and beef ribs, brisket and sausage for the meats, and the mac & cheese, ranch beans, and the shoestring fries for the sides. While we were waiting, we received complimentary cornbread. Moist, fluffy, buttery, and semi-sweet... these cornbreads were the best I've ever had! I'm sure they are SO bad for your health though but I could only live in the moment!  - Baby back ribs: May sound like a boring choice but nope. These were smoked to perfection and the meat fell off the bone. I was very impressed. - Beef ribs: If I had to pick a favorite meat of the meal, the beef ribs would be it. These are finger-licking good with loads of meat, and even some bone marrow too. Just divine. Absolutely to die for. LOVE! - Brisket: The first bite I had of the fatty brisket sent me to meat heaven. Succulent and explosive in taste. The leaner parts of the brisket was a touch dry and needed some extra barbecue sauce to fix that though. - Sausage: Robust in flavor with a nice peppery kick. - Mac & cheese: I'm not usually a fan of mac & cheese but these are great. I ate spoonfuls after spoonfuls.  - Ranch beans: Smoky and savory. Love these beans. Again, best I've had. My favorite of the three sides! - Shoestring fries: I'm generally prefer thick-cut fries but these were an exception. Impeccably fried and perfectly salted, these were very tasty and fun to pick at. Simple yet awesome.  After our incredibly satisfying feast (yes, we had leftovers for the next day!), we were given freshly fried cinnamon sugar doughnuts on our way out. They were amazing! OMG! The first bite of everything at Bobby Q was seriously like a party in my mouth. Every. Single. Thing. From start to finish.  I LOVE BOBBY BBQ! PLEASE COME TO NEW YORK!",

We went to the bar and ordered a few drinks while waiting to be seated. For those who have been here, you know how busy this place can get. So we ordered a few drinks and hanged out while waiting for out table.   Mind you, this place is pretty big and there was still a good wait on a weeknight.   Once seated, we asked out waitress a few questions about the menu. She knew the menu well and made several recommendations.   We ordered a combination of meats.   In short, everything we had from the baby back ribs, beef ribs, sausage, brisket, etc. . ALL OF IT WAS MONEY!  I've been to quite a few bbq joints across the country, Bobby Q is definitely in the top 3. They definitely know how to Q a mean BBQ.  The sides were good but nothing I'd jump out of my seat for. The mac and cheese was mac and cheese like anywhere else. BUT I DIDN'T COME HERE FOR THE SIDES. I came here to try the meat, and in the meat department Bobby Q definitely gets a 5 star rating.   Our server was on point. She came by often to check up on us. This was impressive considering how busy they were. But she did, and came by often.   I would definitely recommend this BBQ joint to anyone in the area. Definitely one of the best around.",

My only issue is that when I was falling into a food coma, the Waiter didn't take notice and shoved HOME MADE donuts in my face. I about died.",

Our waitress was Nikole, and although it was a little hard to hear her, she was the most upbeat and sweet girl we've ever had as a waitress.   The food was amazing! The meats were great, and the sides were just as good. The ambiance was really nice. Kind of like an upscale BBQ joint. Plenty of choices for all types and it came to our table before we could even finish our cornbread.   All in all an excellent dining experience",

The restaurant has a very comforting, family vibe and the smells when we walked in through the door we're a good sign of things to come.. Everything we ordered had a wonderful texture and their meat was fall off the bone good. I also love their spicy BBQ sauce. Our waitress was great.

    "text": "This place brings back some memories. It used to be the old Bobby McGee's themed restaurant, and I used to go on dates with my daughters when they were just little girls. It was dress up time with Dad, and they really enjoyed meeting the various servers that acted out their various personas.   The last time I was here was a few months after they remodeled this place, and turned it into Bobby Q's. The food wasn't that impressive then; therefore, I never made it a point to return.  Due to an accident on the I-17, we had to make a detour on Dunlap to escape the traffic. Instead of having to endure a prolonged wait for dinner, we opted to give this place a try. I forewarned my wife that I didn't think that this place was any good, but we would give it a try anyway.  And we were about to be quite pleasantly surprised.  Riley, our server, greeted us with such enthusiasm and made compelling statements  about how amazing this place was. #89 in the country as far as BBQ joints are concerned, and over 1100 reviews on Yelp.   His statements were received with some trepidation by yours truly, and in my mind, I was saying to myself - we shall see!  My wife ordered the Wood Fired Top Sirloin Steak, and I ordered the 3 meat combo (Pork, Brisket, and Chicken). For our drinks, we ordered the sweet tea.  The tea was just wonderful. Not too sweet and not too tart, and had zero after taste. Just the way the both of us like it.   We were provided with fresh homemade cornbread that was just pure evil! They were absolutely and ridiculously delectable. You could just taste the sweetness, along with all the calories and the carbs! A caution sign should accompany these babies.  In spite of the myriad of people eating here; especially the two large parties that apparently were part of some spring training tour group, the service was prompt and efficient.   Nary an empty moment went by without Riley continually checking in on us and apprising us of our meal's status.  Not too terribly long afterwards, our meals were presented to us.  My wife really enjoyed her Sirloin Steak, and she was quite impressed with the roasted corn that came with it. And the generously lavish heap of shoe string fries made a great accompaniment to her already delicious meal.  My 3 meat BBQ combo was quite heavenly. The smoked meats were very tender, and the sampling of the various BBQ sauces provided just brought out their flavors even more.  In the middle of us enjoying our meal; Renee, the manager stopped by and checked in on us as well. She was engaging and quite friendly. She even helped clear our table as we progressed through our dining experience.  And when we were all done, Riley spent a few moments recapping our experience.  We had nothing but great things to say about the service and their food. Both were thoroughly enjoyable!",

I had the Whole Hog Heaven, ending up taking half of it home! It was some of the best BBQ I've had, though not the best (That was Oklahoma Joe's in KC).  The atmosphere was upscale with a down-home twist. They have a large beer selection and top off dinner with some freshly-baked donut holes (free with the meal).  I highly recommend this place when you're in the Phoenix area and have a hankerin' for BBQ.",

    "text": "Solid BBQ joint! My main issue is that it feels like a chain place (which is really just my own mental silliness).   My friend and I shared the Hog Heaven platter for $50 and it did not disappoint. Choice of 4 meats and 3 sides was more food than we could handle (leftovers were eaten for 2 days after). The meat was all tender, the rib meat fell right off the bone. I'd say the beef brisket was my favorite, which is funny because it's usually pork! Our sides were all good, but the veggies could have been a little better. I would suggest scaling down the \"variety\" and just sticking to 2-3 different types so you get more than just 1 of each veggie.   Well done on the corn bread snack!   I would return but will probably try another BBQ joint first.",

My girlfriend and I had gone in on a whim to try something new, and I'm always hesitant about bbq places, as most here are really dry or burnt. I ordered the beef ribs with their spicy bbq sauce. Now this is where the fun begins. When our food came out, it looked incredible. I wanted to dive right in to those ribs, so I pick it up by the bone, and nearly all the meat fell off. You could cut it wit a spoon. It was so tender and flavorful. It's definitely a meal I will never forget. I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to experience bbq the way it should be.",

They had several draught beers here too.  The brisket, baby back ribs, and BBQ chicken were delicious!!! The runner even brought out extra BBQ sauce for us which I recommend since they don't put much on the meat when they serve it.  The ribs were fall off the bone, smoky, and charred. The brisket was tender, and my dining companions favorite thing of the meal.  The BBQ chicken was a little pink which is common for on the smoking process and tasted amazing.  Our service was attentive and a manager checked in with us and thanked us for visiting.  For lunch for 2 with 1 drink each it was about $70 before tip.  We had a lot of leftovers which made it a good value!",

Bob himself seemed respected by his team. I loved the atmosphere. Baked beans were really good.  Great texture.  Not just a soggy mess. Onion strings were perfect.  The top sirloin I got was very tough, strings of gristle running through it, making it even harder to cut. I didn't order the filet because I wanted more flavor than a filet usually provides.  The flavor of the sirloin was lack luster.  A good grill flavor but not much to it. It was cooked perfectly.   They did so much right but for a bbq place with not so great steak, I really want to go with 3.5 stars.  I'll be back to try the ribs and brisket.  I have high hopes that I will be updating my rating.",

    "text": "I noticed that the owner/manager of Bobby Q is frequently on this yelp page, so I really hope he gets to this review because I had a fantastic dinner at Bobby Q's Sunday night. The food, ambience, and everything was great, but what really set this place over the top for me was our server, Anthony.  So if the staff over at Bobby Q's ever reads this, I just want to let them know how impressed I was with Anthony's service(enough to toss him a $10 tip on a $20 check, it'd be more but a starving student can only give so much haha). He was not only attentive and helpful but was very friendly throughout the night. Coming by at the most opportune times to offer us water refills, extra sauce(warmed sauce, fancy!), and even suggested different items on the menu that he thought we'd like better(which we did!) Such a great guy and really made a huge difference in our dining experience.  So if you ever get the chance to stop by Bobby Q's, ask for Anthony and toss him a huge tip as a thank you after you have one of the greatest dining experiences of your life!  Haha.  All that aside, the food at Bobby Q's was great as well. We got the three meat combo with Beef Ribs(great), Baby back ribs(my personal favorite), and beef brisket(a tad bit dry, but still good) with Mac and cheese(amazing!) and shoestring fries(also good) as the sides. Everything was great, and the fact that we didn't have to wait an hour like at other BBQ places was another huge plus as well. The food came quick, was piping hot, and they even split it onto two plates for us because I was splitting the food.  At the end of the dinner, they gave us some cinnamon donuts to-go with our meal, which was the real cherry on top of everything. Loved this place, will definitely be bringing friends here for BBQ nights, and I could go on for days about the great service from Anthony.",

    "text": "As a relatively new transplant from the Bay Area I lamented the lack of great , independently owned restaurants here in the Phoenix area- particularly given that I live pretty far north up the 17 near Happy Valley with little more than national chains. But a friend suggested I try this place for great BBQ so last week I took the 17 minute drive and was absolutely knocked out on a number of levels.   The service of this establishment is superb. It is one of the best managed restaurants I've ever patronized and the staff, from the bartender to the server all operated at a very high standard.   Now as for the food, one night I had their St Louis style ribs SANS the extra sauce ( I am a dry rub guy) and they were superb. Not fatty at all, tasty,  and the meat fell off the bone. Good fries and a very nice pecan coleslaw. Buy the chicken tender appetizer? OMG! By far and away the best I have had anywhere in the country!  Last night I enjoyed the fried chicken which is actually a butterflied breast of chicken - also excellent. The friendly gentleman sitting next to me at the bar had their prime rib and LOVED it. It looked AWESOME!  A big shout out to the manager Taylor who handled a minor issue ( my bad, not Bobby Q) in a MOST professional way. If in Phoenix you absolutely MUST go and if you're coming in for only 3 or 4 days, I would absolutely recommend you place Bobby Q on your list as those restaurants you simply cannot overlook on your trip to the desert.",

    "text": "After reading several reviews about how good the brisket was I decided I had to try it. I went over on a Friday afternoon and sat at the bar. They had the lunch menu and their dinner menu and I noticed the lunch brisket was only around three dollars less expensive then the brisket platter. The bartender said that the dinner platter was a better value so that's what I went with. I opted for the fries and the coleslaw as the two sides. I have to say the brisket was amazing. Not only was it very tender but it was not at all dried out like so many other places that I have tried. Even people from Texas would be impressed.  My only minor complaint was the fries could have been crispier. I also have to say that I really like their ice tea as well.   There are so many interesting options on the menu I deafly will be coming back to this place to try them out.    I haven't been to Bobby Q's for a few years. The last time was meeting up with friends from work for a going away party. They had a special room in the back for us. The appetizers we had were very good.  This place has really nice atmosphere. It would be a great place to bring somebody for that first date. Service is also very good. When I was finished the bartender gave me a fresh iced tea to go. That was greatly appreciated on a hot day.   Their busiest day of the year was Father's Day. I was there at about 2:30 pm and the wait was between an hour and a half and hour and 45 minutes long so I didn't stay but I knew I would have to come back soon. And I'm glad I did.",

Appetizer we ordered the Q ROLLS tasty deep fried brisket with a Bbq dipping sauce and spicy dipping sauce as well-I enjoyed the bbq as it was a little sweet how I like it!  Main course we split the prime rib & bbq chicken combo.  Combo comes with a potato and two sides.  We ordered the MAC AND CHEESE and OH MY GOD it was prob the best Mac and cheese I've had in a while---five stars alone!!!!. The other side was the veggies...eh wasn't a fan . The veggies they chose were onions? Squash and peppers, to me that just wasn't what I was expecting- I had in mind broccoli or cauliflower? Seemed like an odd choice   For  dessert we ordered the mud pie to go !  As a bonus they give you some homemade donuts for the road ( I was too stuffed but my bf said they were amazing)  Overall good pick, good music, and good service! Will be back for sure!",

We could not have been more pleased with this decision.  We were seated promptly for our 7:30 reservation.  Our waiter (so sorry I forgot his name) conversed with us as he took our order - asked what we ere doing in town, where we were going, etc.  He answered our questions and made recommendations.  Two of the guys shared the Hog Heaven, two ordered the St Louis ribs and I ordered the beef ribs.  We also ordered the Q Rolls as an appetizer.  They Q Rolls were incredibly delicious (order this!) and even though the dinner portions were large, at the end of the meal everything was gone.  One of the managers (Jack) came by a number of times to see how we were doing and converse about the history of the restaurant, where we were golfing, what baseball games we were seeing, etc.  The personal touches made us feel very comfortable and welcome.  Then they topped it all off with a small bag of donuts and sent us on our way.  Wish we could have come back but our time there was packed.  But next time we're in Phoenix, you can bet we'll be by.",

    "text": "Wow... Where to start. Pulled up and the parking lot was packed. Almost turned around and went somewhere else but everyone I had talked to about this place said it was amazing food... And it was my birthday, so being a special occasion, we waited for a parking spot.  Got seated in less than 3 minutes. Only draw back... Right by the cooking chickens. Really the hottest seat in the place!  But it was a cold night so we didn't complain. And the table is right by the kitchen but it wasn't loud like most restaurants.  Ordered cocktails and an appetizer. Mine was supposed to be served in a pineapple but arrived in a regular glass. Kind of a let down. But it was strong and good. And that's where the issues stopped.  Ordered the Spinach Artichoke dip. SO GOOD! The tomatillo salsa that accompanied it was devine.  I ordered the Jumbo baked potato with brisket and my mom got the brisket platter. The brisket is so tinder and delicious it just crumbles. We asked for extra BBQ sauce and the server brought out the original and Carolina. Their Carolina is a red sauce and not a Carolina gold. Peppery and spicy. But good. We both preferred the original. More on the sweeter side.  Both ordered the Mac & Cheese and my mom ordered the Pecan Cole Slaw. Mac & Cheese was heavenly. And mom loved the slaw.  I have a walnut allergy so it sadly limited my desert fare. Ended up with the Bread Pudding. It was really good... But by that point we could only eat a few bites as we were stuffed and were taking home leftovers.   The staff was very nice and spent time with us. And the GM spent time with us on the patio talking about the company history and transition to BBQ (we were long time customers of their Bobby McGees in California).  In summation.... GO!  You won't be disappointed! I've been back since to order the baked potato to go. Even better the second time around!",

    "text": "I'll go 4.5/5 for this one.  I've eaten BBQ all over the country, and I can't say Bobby Q is \"as good as it gets\", but they are pretty darn good.  Almost 3 weeks ago Mr. M and I met up with Tim S. and his family to give this place a try.    Right away I was impressed with the friendly service, and the hostess was helpful when we needed to add a high chair to the table.  Our server was Kanisha and she did a great job and was on point with taking our orders, making sure our drinks weren't empty, and bringing us togo boxes and the check when we were ready.    We wanted to be able to try a wide variety of items so we started with the Q-rolls ($10.50), which are absolutely delicious.  Brisket wrapped up like an egg roll?  Heck yeah!  Those disappeared quickly.  We also started with their house beer, which if memory serves is an amber ale and that was a nice, easy to drink beer.  Really enjoyed that as well.  The smaller one is $4.95 and the larger one is $6.00, so the moral of that story is, go for the big one!  I ordered the BBQ chicken/prime rib combo ($34) which came with 3 sides.  I chose the loaded baked potato, mac & cheese, and the ranch beans.  Mr. M ordered the 3 meat combo ($25) with pulled pork, brisket, and some ribs.    I thought I would waddle out of the joint stuffed to the gills, but we actually had so much fun talking that I didn't eat nearly as much as I thought I would.  Here's what I thought of the food:  Prime rib, chicken, and ribs:  Excellent!  Brisket: very good.  Pulled pork and ranch beans: really nothing going on there.  Very little flavor in the pork, and the beans tasted syrupy and had no BBQ flavor.  The other sides we had were very good.  I could OD on the mac & cheese.  Nicely done.  Lunch was pricey if you look at the receipt total of $93.63 after tax, before tip, but we had a lot of leftovers.  Overall we had a great experience and I would go back any time.",

Ribs were succulent and off the bone tender. They had a smoky and flavorful bbq taste. Both sides were flavorful and were a great palette refresher.  St. Louis Style Ribs W/ Corn and Cold Slaw- 4/5 rating. These ribs were more meatier yet still were fall of the bone tender. However, these had a less of a bbq and smoky flavor than the baby back ribs. Both sides brought value to the Ribs as well.   Bbq Brisket W/ MAC n Cheese and Cold Slaw- 3.5/5 rating. Brisket was very tender with a nice melt in your mouth texture. However, they lacked a predominant smoky flavor and the portion was skimp to price. Mac n Cheese was very cheesy while Cold Slaw had good flavor.   Overall, this place is great to pig out and have an awesome time with dynamite bbq. Service was superb and as an added bonus you get mini donuts at the end of your meal;)  Note: Prepare for long lines or else call in reservations.",

But boy were we oh so happy that they were because we ended up finding Bobby Q's.   Again, sticking to the whole honesty thing, we loved everything about this joint. From the moment we walked in and saw just how charming the venue was to the exceptionally good customer service they delivered, this place was on point. Our waiter even had the perfect balance of knowing when to check on us and when not to. He kept our drinks topped off and was so knowledgeable about everything they had. You could tell the staff took pride in working there.  We shared a dinner combo: ribs and top sirloin with a baked potato, mac n cheese, and roasted corn. We also shared their signature mud slide pie. Everything was good but let me break this feast down to my personal favorites:  The Ribs - I can totally see why they'd be dubbed \"World Famous\" for it. I mean, the meat literally falls right off the bone while maintaining the right amount of tenderness you can only find in a perfectly slow-smoked BBQ.  The Roasted Corn - I've never had anything like it. It's rich with buttery goodness and makes a stance with the char it leaves in your mouth long after you've digested. This is one of those sides that shouldn't even be a side, it's just. that. good.   Bobby Q's, thank you for being open when all the competitors were closed - you guys have officially left me with a tasteful experience I will never forget.",

Bobby's claims it was voted the Best BBQ in the US, although I'm not sure of their source? Nevertheless, I'd have a hard time arguing, as it definitely sets the bar extremely high. We've been here several times and have never had a bad meal. In fact, virtually everything we've tried on the menu seems to be done correctly.   The pulled pork, which is my preferred way to eat BBQ, always manages to impress me with its flavor. For sides, I've had the mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese, which is far superior to that low-grade sludge they try to get away with dishing out at all of these other places in Phoenix. Even their fries are better than you'd expect.  The place is decorated to the point where, if I didn't know any better, I would have wrongfully assumed it was a chain restaurant. But yet, I like that, despite their popularity, they haven't decided to branch out and open up 20 different locations all over the city (and I actually hope they never do for quality and consistency purposes).  I've always wondered if their steaks are equally as good as their BBQ, but I've never wanted to sacrifice the taste of a great pulled pork sandwich in order to find out. And we're always so full after our meals that we've never been able to try some of their desserts. Based on their Yelp pictures, it seems like many people are in the same boat.  But, like all business owners should know, it's the little things that go a long way. The complimentary cornbread you receive before your meal is both unique, yet extremely well done. Oh, and that's not all. On your way out, you also get treated to a little bag of their homemade donuts, which you can often spot being made whenever you first walk in. I've said many times that it's little touches like that keep customers coming back - and it most definitely works. It's not rocket science and I'm amazed that other restaurants have failed to adopt this well-received approach.  Easily one the best BBQ experience in all of Phoenix and a great all-around business!",

I got a huge helping of gelatinous cartilage and fat, and a small helping of actual meat. Now burnt ends are again one of my favorites, but there really weren't any of those dry crunchy ends packed with flavor one would expect. And the small amount of what i did actually eat consisted of 3 unflavorful bites. Lacking any real smoke flavor or even basic seasoning. In my opinion they hope their bbq sauce will give you the flavor the meat is desperately needing. The wait staff where great and the mac nd cheese was super creamy. Other then that, they would have rated a 2. Eat and live well my friends.",

    "text": "Been going to Bobby Q's for years.  Love the lunch atmosphere, and specials.  The Mac 'n Cheese has always ranked at the top of my lists as the very best ever!  The pulled pork and brisket have always been excellent, but this last time I tried something different - a burger!  Yeah, I know, this is a BBQ joint, why would anyone get a burger?  Well, I am glad I did!  Like the Mac 'n Cheese, this burger is now at the top of my list!  It was sooo... damn... good!!!  The \"Perfect\" burger was just that  - perfect!  I ordered the meat medium and that was how it came out. The meat was amazingly tender with incredible flavor. It would be really hard to find better.  Maybe the only burger I've ever had better was at Carver's Steak house where they made my son a Whiskey Peppercorn burger that was not on the menu.  At Bobby Q's, I could only eat 1/2, and the next day my reheat was still amazingly good!  We also tried their beef brisket flour taquitos that were insanely delicious as an appetizer!  Later that evening we went to the Yard House at Westgate and I tried their famous Vampire Tacos - they weren't as good as these beef brisket taquitos at Bobby Q's.  Thumbs up to Bobby Q's.  People love the cornbread here too!  Baked in cast iron, it has an incredible crust.  Still, personally, I liked the Old El Paso BBQ Company's cornbread, but they no longer exist here.  I got to say - I love this place!  Fantatstic food and service that always delivers!!!  We left with about 10 complimentary cinnamon sugar mini donuts they make fresh and hot right there.  Killer deals at Bobby Q's happy hour (3-6) too for their beef brisket tacos!  Go, you simply will not be disappointed!",

Kept getting annoyed by a house fly in the patio, and the water feature noise, but quickly seated inside when I asked. The food was obviously delicious as you can see from other reviews. It was a bit pricey, but I was NOT visiting such a lovely restaurant without getting the steak. Worth every penny and the place was so charming I'd definitely go there for any occasion.   Quick note: as I was leaving the manager asked how everything was, and handed me a small package which when I opened - when I got home - turned out to be the most delicious tiny doughnuts.

The only thing was there was not enough BBQ sauce on top and we needed to ask for extra.

We didn't get any dessert but were given some fresh mini-donuts to go. That was a pleasant surprise.",

I forgot to mention in my last review that not only was every single item that we ordered from the menu spot on but Ann, our waitress, also gave us mini funnel cake like donuts to go... ON THE HOUSE.

I don't know how old it is but to me it looks a hundred years old with Giant Old Trees shading the parking lot. As you walk in you do get hit with an aromatic BBQ aroma.   We were quickly seated and our server gave us a fast run down on Bobby Q. We learned that everything is made in house and the meats are smoked with mesquite wood. They also start everybody out with what I recognize as Johnny Cakes with soft whipped butter.  I had the BBQ Pulled Chicken Sandwich with Pecan Cole Slaw. The Chicken was falling apart tender and laced with sweetness but not too much. A small amount of skinny fried onions were added to my sandwich on a soft grilled roll. The coleslaw was drip free and fresh and crunchy.  My husband had a much better value item called the lunch sampler plate with 3 meats and a side. He enjoyed everything. I tried a taste of the brisket and for me it was too succulent and fatty but for my husband who likes fat he thought it was just right. My husband ate the macaroni and cheese I have to say it tasted like processed cheese. I didn't like the macaroni and cheese but I know most people do like this style. My husband liked the beans too he said they were packed with all kinds of meat ends.  When you're all done they present you with a bag of Fresh Made Thank \"Q\" Cinnamon  Sugar Donuts.  Not my stye of BBQ but I still thought it was good and plan to return for dinner.",

The parking lot is a good size with plenty of parking, provided i was there for an early dinner so this may not be True during peak hours.  The entrance to the restaurant is on the side of the building.  inside there is a small bar and a nice dinning area.  You can see the chickens on the rotisserie in the back, and the smell makes you instantly hungry.  We were seated near the back and our waiter (Riley) was quick to greet us and make sure we were doing good.  Not knowing what to get Riley made a few suggestions for us to think about before taking out drink orders.  Most of us got the Bobby Q Amber Ale and one Strawberry Lemonade.  We decided to order the Whole Hog Heaven and a second order of ribs.  While we waited for our meal we had some of their fresh complementary corn bread and enjoyed our cold drinks.  Food came out in the right amount of time, not too long or too fast.    All of the food was delicious and went well with the beer.  During our visit the staff was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.  Drinks never went empty and we had wet naps before we asked.  To finish everything off we got free doughnuts at the end.  This is one of the best BBQ places i have visited and i will definitely be back during my next visit.",

    "text": "Yay..my first review!  Bobby Q will not disappoint you. This place has a spacious parking lot and street parking which makes coming here pretty convenient. The hostess was pleasant and our waiter was very patient with us.  I highly recommend the St Louis style ribs. All the ribs are cooked for 10+ hours so they fall right off the bone and melt in your mouth. If you're looking for something much bigger for 2+ people to share and want to try a variety of items, Whole Hog Heaven is for you! Keep in mind the name, because that's exactly what you're getting. It's a heavenly plate of four types of meat along with three sides. We got mac n cheese (good but not great), shoe string fries (yum!), and roasted corn (ok).  *sigh*..I'm still stuffed thinking about it.   Oh, don't forget to mention Yelp and get 10% off!",

    "text": "Biz partner and I were running around today and needed to hit up something along I-17 to grab a late lunch. I've seen the place a million times and love BBQ, but after 4 years in AZ, have never been here! Sucks, because it seems I was really missing out. The place is huge, decor is very sharp and the smokey smell off BBQ throughout the place was a good sign! The service was on point...quick drinks and refills, very attentive and friendly. What a shock!   Upon sitting down, we received 2 small cakes of cornbread (free) which was a nice filler. I had the BBQ brisket sandwich and my biz partner had the pulled pork sandwich. We both agreed the meat was tender and flavorful. The buns are slightly toasted, so the sauce doesn't get soaked in the bread. The server asked if we would like additional BBQ sauce...I said no, but wished I would have. Although the meat is very tasty, I did find it a little light on sauce (and the sauce is good stuff). After we finished our sandwiches, the server brought 2 little cinnamon/sugar donuts for desert in a small brown bag (fresh, hot and also free!) Very good way to end a good meal. We both agreed, this will definitely be a place added to our rotation as traveling throughout the city!!!",

I personally shy away from BBQ spots as they generally are overpriced, they over-sauce and under produce according to my BBQ standards. However, this place is good and I will definitely return. We decided on the Whole Hog Heaven as we are East Valley folk and although we plan on returning it may be a while, so a sample of everything is what we were aiming for. We chose the baby backs and St. Louis for ribs and sausage and brisket for our other meat options. For sides we ordered the Mac and Cheese, which was delicious by the way, fries, ranch beans and an extra side of roasted corn. The meal came with cornbread.  The food was delicious and plentiful. The ribs were tender, meat falling off the bones. The brisket was good but I have had better. The sausage was tasty but nothing spectacular. All of the sides were tasty. I left there with a full belly, a hefty to go bag and no compliant. I will be back.",

One, they're smoked - so literally half the cooking is done for you. I can't stand putting an entire raw bird in an oven and waiting for it to cook for 234 hours. Well, I've never really done that, because I think I wouldn't like it much, as I hate waiting while I watch people poke, prod, and baste a raw behemoth and then put it in the oven for 234 hours.   This thing was done in I think 2 hours. 2 hours!!! Brilliant. And better yet - it tasted phenomenal. The spice rub was so complementary to the meat it needed no sauce to make it a tasty experience.   And it wasn't cost-prohibitive. The only thing you really need to worry about is ordering one well enough ahead of time for your occasion.",

We shared the baby back ribs, pulled pork and brisket; our sides were mac and cheese and beans. The cornbread and the doughnuts at the end were quite enjoyable.   Everything was delicious.  The great thing was that since we told them we were sharing, they split the dinner on two plates so we didn't have to do that at the table.

Her name is Shay, and girl, you are just a SuperServer.  She is five stars.  She is excellence in itself.  The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty good, casual yet upscale bbq joint.  They nailed that.  One thing to note is that all the meats are smoked for over 20 hours.  Sounds good!  We own a smoker, and the longest we had smoked anything was 8 hours.  For the appetizer, we ordered the Q rolls;  Tortilla wrapped brisket deep fried and served with chipotle sauce.  YUMMY!  Delicous!  If I come back, I will order these again.  The cornbread everyone raved about was alright..  For the main entree we split the 3  meat combo;  the pork, brisket, and sausage.  For the sides we had mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese.  Sure glad we shared.  It was alot of food.  This  is where it falls for me.  Maybe I went on an off day; but the meats were disappointing, especially after hearing they have been smoked for 20 hours. It was not flavorful or delectable or anything, just meat that was edible.  Even drowning it in bbq sauce didn't make it anymore appetizing for me. The mashed potatoes were very very BLAND.  I salt and peppered them to death trying to flavor them a bit.  The mac and cheese was very creamy, and was decent, but...I make tastier mac at home, thought not as creamy.  Its sad for me to convey this; I really was not satisfied with my meal.  Now the doughnuts they provided at the end of the meal was fresh and good.   I don't know if I will be back, mainly because I want to try other restaurants and there are so many options out there.  But when I finish my quest to attempt different types of eateries, Bobby Q is not a place I would write off.",

    "text": "This is good barbeque in an unlikely spot -- Phoenix.  The meats are all slow-cooked, so everything is fork-fall-apart, Kansas City-style.  They have some variations in sauces, too -- a vinegary Carolina-type sauce, a spicy one and a sweeter KC sauce.  The sides are well-prepared, including traditional cole slaw; corn; beans; potatoes.  For appetizers, try the sauteed shrimp...perfectly cooked and garlicky.  When all is said and done and you hate yourself for eating that much meat, they give you a brown bag of freshly made, sugary mini-donuts.  Just so you can hate yourself a little more.  Service is always friendly and usually prompt.  Recommended!",

Garrett was a great waiter as he had the right mix of being attentive without hovering.  I received a birthday treat, thanks Taylor and Garrett, which was very chocolatey good.

    "text": "The bbq here is pretty good, but that has been documented well by others. My favorite thing on the menu is actually the fried chicken. It's a HUGE boneless breast that is breaded in a yummy coating and although it is fried, it is not a big greasy blob. It comes with two sides, but they suggest one be the mashed potatoes and gravy. The mash is really quite good. There is a hint of spice in there that is unexpected and nice.  My only gripe is that they serve the gravy on top of the fried chicken and I have never understood why you would drench something crispy in anything that is going to eventually turn everything to a gooey mess.  The flavor is great. Just put it on the side.  The free donuts are a nice touch, but nothing special, so save the calories and get the banana pie/pudding thing. The crust is made of crushed nuts, which is then topped with a substantial layer of bannana pudding. All of this is then topped with carmelized bananas and drizzled in carmel. YUMMO!!  And if you like their macaroni and cheese (which IMHO) is heavenly cheesy goodness, skip it as a side and order a quart to go instead.  You will get about 8 to 10 side servings for around $6.50 and that is a HUGE savings over the sides price.  Put your walking shoes on for the hike you will need to burn off the calories and just know going in that you have to through your diet out the window for one good meal.",

We were here two nights ago and ordered smoked sausage, brisket, shredded pork sandwiches and BBQ eggrolls. Every (literal) thing was delicious from the homemade pecan cole slaw to the light barbeque sauce (which acts as showcase for the food, rather than \"hiding\" behind the sauce at Bobby Q's).   Our waitress Cristin took a real interest in telling us what special things the owner had collected and curated in his travels while developing his own barbeque style. The staff very much love working here and have a lot of respect for the food and for the patrons enjoying their food. They were so sweet and considerate to have given us beignets to bring home for our game night.   We are from out of town but I cannot highly recommend Bobby Q's enough, and we will DEFINITELY be returning next time we are in Phoenix. Just a perfect place all around from the warm atmosphere to the stellar barbeque. And we lived in Memphis for many years and KNOW barbeque. Great job and keep up the good work.",

Can't imagine why other restaurants never thought of this.   Corn bread comes out first. Just the right amount of sweet and perfectly crisped edges, with a delightfully fluffy center. My only complaint is that we didn't receive more than one each!   For our entree, we split the three meat combo (baby back ribs, brisket, pulled pork), which comes with any two sides (pecan cole slaw, mac n cheese). They split it between two plates without being asked, which was a nice little surprise. It didn't look like enough food for the both of us and we thought we may need to order an appetizer, but it ended up being just the right amount of food!  The cole slaw is refreshing and makes for a nice break between bites of the other \"heavy\" foods. Mac n cheese is both extremely cheesy and saucy, so if a \"drier\" mac is what you prefer, I'd skip this. Meats were all incredibly tender and weren't drowning in BBQ sauce, as some other reviewers had experienced.   They finish you off with fresh donuts. Who even needs to order dessert!? They're like little cinnamon pillows. I thought I was too full for anything after dinner, but I finished off the donuts before we even made it back to the car.   Five star experience from start to finish.",

My first thought when arriving was this place was pretty hidden, there is plenty of parking, the restaurant is big, and best yet, it smelled great from outside already! We were a little worried it was going to be busy and would have to wait a bit for lunch because of its popularity, but we got greeted and were seated right away!   Our server Hunter greeted soon after and introduced himself and told us about Bobby Q and now they smoke their meats. He was extremely helpful and friendly and checks in on us frequently since he knew this was our first time. My friend and I each got the or own 3 meat combo which was only $25 and came with 2 sides! I chose the brisket, baby back ribs, and pulled pork with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. We also ordered their blonde ale beer, which was good refresher.   We waited for our food, and were given corn bread. Which were amazing!! We had to stop ourselves before we got full from them. Our food came quicker than expected, and we were not disappointed. There was definitely more food than I was expecting. There was going to be leftovers for sure. Having the first bit was heaven and knew immediately this must've been the best BBQ I've ever had. Way better than the Wood Ranch here for sure. My favorite was the spicy BBQ that our server Hunter gave us. It had a little kick without it being to spicy. My friend and I enjoyed our plans until we were too full, which we barely ate half our plates. We were more than happy to have it for leftover dinner.   Before leaving, Hunter gave us complimentary donuts, which were a great touch, but we were way to full to have any, so added it on to our leftover bag.   Overall, this place was delicious! Service and food was excellent!  I will definitely have to stop by here when I come back to Phoenix.",

    "text": "Whoa.  Fantastic BBQ.  Out of the numerous places I've been to, Texas and all, Bobby Q wins numero uno at this point.  It's really hard to find good brisket.  Bobby Q has GREAT brisket...the best I've ever had.  And yes, even better than the places I've been to in Texas.  The BBQ overall was better than what I've had in Texas.    We ordered a 3 meat combo platter with ribs, sausage, and brisket.  Our sides included pecan cole slaw and mac n cheese.  The cole slaw wasn't very tasty or flavorful.  The mac n cheese was cheesy, creamy, and yum.  We also ordered a side of veggies to make us feel better about our meal.  Haha.    It was busy but we were able to get a table right away.  Service was decent.  Parking gets a little packed but you'll find a space somewhere.     Oh, and at the end of the meal...you get fresh donuts sprinkled in cinnamon sugar FTW!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  (Yes, that's my Hunter Pence chant.)    Bobby Q is doing everything right and I'm so glad I got to try it.  Gives me another reason to come back and visit Phoenix!",

I have also had the salmon, which was great and cooked perfectly.  I also went there with my family for a birthday celebration, so we all ordered various things.  The whole hog is great because it is a lot of food, and easily feeds 2 people.  The ribs are very tender, and the brisket is awesome! Everything here is delicious, and this has definitely become one of my favorite places.  The cornbread is a great little appetizer, though I wouldn't eat too much because I prefer to save room for all of the BBQ!   Overall, the service is fantastic, and the food is awesome.  Also, the donuts at the end, are a great touch! :-)  I would recommend this place to anyone!",

The corn had great flavor along with the corn bread patties. Grilled chicken and ribs had decent flavor, a little smokey, very little char. .. The ribs were very tender but the chicken was a tad dry. Great smoked sausage and shoestring fries. The bbq sauce was tasty, not overly sweet and not to runny. Cinnamon donuts are a nice touch at the end of the meal.  Overall I would give it 3.5.

It wasn't over the top but just nice that they cared to follow up. I had a beef brisket sandwhich with a 22oz Fresh Squeezed IPA and my brother had a pulled look sanwhich with coleslaw and sweet tea. They served warm complementary cornbread with butter and finished the meal with cinnamon mini donuts. My beef brisket sandwhich was moist and cooked well. The bun was the sugary white bread and not totally unique (not 5star) but still tasted good. There is better BBQ but this was a good lunch. I will say, my brother remarked that the price seemed a bit high but I think this is pretty standard for most BBQ spots. The server we had was spot on. I wish I knew his name. I'd recommend this guy move to fine dinning and that Bobby's holds on to him. You'll notice him from other establishments. This is the waiter that cares.",

They do request a 15 minute grace period to seat you after your set time, which was told to us when we called to reserve a table a few days prior. We arrived and checked in. We checked with the hostess at 3:45 and she reminded us of the grace period. We waited and waited...30 minutes later, we checked again and we're told we were coming up on the list. After another 20 minutes, we checked again only to be told they \"forgot\" about us and then seated us immediately.  The manager, Laura, came to the table to apologize for their mistake. She was the BEST! She was friendly, sincere, and assured us that she would take care of some of our bill due to their mistake.   The waitress was great, food was beyond delicious, and even another manager stopped by the table to see if things were all good. We got the bill and our appetizer was taken off. We paid, tipped and left the restaurant.  We were in the parking lot when Laura chased us down to talk about our bill. She said it wasn't taken care of enough to make up for the inconvenience we experienced when we arrived. She voided the charge and gave us a great discount. We were shocked and so grateful for the exceptional customer service displayed by Laura and her staff. Thank you for making our Mother's Day dinner great!!",

We always get a platter that they offer which allows us to try a variety of meat and sides. My preschool daughters are very picky but loved the pulled chicken. I am not a fan of the pulled pork but the St. Louis ribs are incredible and the meat falls off the bone!! The macaroni and cheese is extra, extra cheesy and delicious. The cap to the meal is the fresh donuts they offer at the end, leaving no reason to purchase dessert. To wash it all down, nothing beats their strawberry lemonade served in a frosted glass. Oh my!!! We love it.  It has been challenging to find good barbecue in AZ and this is definitely really good and worth trying.",

FALLING OFF THE BONE. They smoke that shiz for 18 long beautiful hours! We were all very happy with our meal and I only wish there was BBQ this good in LA.  Afterwards we all shared an order of peach cobbler and nearly fell asleep at the table from tasty overload. I haven't had cobbler that good since I was a kid and my godmother use to pick the fruit fresh from her trees.  I bookmarked this spot for our trip to AZ and completely forgot to mention Yelp for 10% off. I would be kicking myself harder if the food wasn't worth the price in full. I have to remove the one star for not having the baby back ribs.",

I had the Cajun shrimps and prime rib on Friday. Sides: Corn and coleslaw. Was great. Sunday was even better: the three meat combo: Texas ribs, st. Louis ribs and beef brisket. Same sides.

Fast and friendly service. And most importantly good food. Go on Sunday's and they have special called Hog's Heaven at a discounted prices ($28). It comes with 1/2 pound each of the following: Chicken, Brisket, St Louis Ribs, Baby Back Ribs and two sides. More than enough food to feed 4 adults and 4 children.   The brisket was my favorite. It was melt in your mouth good. I would have preferred if they did not douse it with BBQ sauce as I like it on the side. It was still good. Ribs were off the bone delicious. These were my kids favorite. The chicken was moist. For the two sides we ordered shoe string fries, they were OK, nice and crispy and the grilled veggies.   When you leave they give you complimentary donuts, which are freshly fried in the front. They have a cool looking mini fryer. They were yummy according to my kids. I did not partake in those as I was stuffed.   I will be going back to this place again fo-sure.   BTW there is a bar with a dance floor on the other side of the restaurant for those of you who are interested. Look they were just getting ready for the night crowd when we were leaving.",

For some reason I expected a cafe-style joint given that most places in Arizona are run that way but instead we were greeted with a big, fully decorated roadhouse style building with a huge patio and fancy interior. They even had a separate bar area which I plan to try out soon. I was told it was overpriced and overrated by my in-laws and it was everything but that! We both got a sampler platter which comes with three meat choices, a side, cornbread, and little unexpected fried sugar dough thingers to send you off. I'm usually expecting dried meat and sides that taste like they've been sitting out but everything was perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy. I was even impressed by the corn that had a sweet smokey flavor to it. Only $26 before tax for two people as well. Service was great, energetic, and helpful as well. We took home what little scraps we had and had a midnight snack that reheated well too. I can't wait to come back with friends and family to show them a \"cooler\" version of claim jumpers.",

That made me very happy because even though it was really too much food, the last 2 times we ate here the portion was much smaller.  We had really wonderful service (Zac) and there was a table having a party that just kept growing (I think eventually 18 people arrived) and no service suffered because of it so bravo to everyone for being able to handle a full restaurant and a huge group of people while not ignoring the rest of the patrons.",

Portions aren't enormous, but just about right so that you don't over eat.  Edit 9/12  - I visited this place again on another business trip this time with a client, and I must say I was highly impressed.  I suspect the first time I went, something went wrong.  Maybe the chef was having a bad day or something?  Either way, I ordered the Pork Pull burger and I must say it was really tasty.  Wasn't dry as my first experience, and had just the right amount of BBQ sauce.  Very impressed.  Bumping up a star to average a 3 and 5 to 4!",

I finally made it to the restaurant side were I was told they had two smokers (a must for good BBQ). I went for the half order of baby back ribs and thought they were GREAT, darn good BBQ sauce too I must say. I got the beans and coleslaw with pecans, the beans are cowboy BBQ style, not bad and the slaw is very good, you also get corn bread that is better then mom makes, (my mom uses the box mix). One of the best BBQ joints in Phoenix for sure.",

    "text": "I first walked into this restaurant very unaware of its culture and cuisine. It was the closest restaurant to me when I was working as an intern a couple of years ago and so my roommate and I went one Sunday afternoon. We were quite surprised to come across this quite elegantly themed restaurant amidst a not-so-great neighborhood. The interior of the restaurant has a darker, vintage vibe to it and the outside patio is beautifully lit and adorned with a waterfall and misters for those infamous Phoenix summer days. The food experience was the fun part. We opted to for the Whole Hog which is a selection of three different meats of your choosing and three sides. We had the pulled pork,  the sausage, and the brisket. By far, the sausage there is the best sausage I've ever had. Might I add, prior to them serving our main dish, they bring out complementary corn bread that is second to none. I recommend this restaurant for anyone wanting to impress on a date or any company wanting to host a business meeting.",

It is soooo good,creamy sweet with crisp fresh slaw with fresh pecans.  Give it a try.   The cornbread is awesome and they will give you some homemade sugar doughnuts on your way out.

I've impressed that a BBQ-based company is so accommodating of vegetarian diets and that their vegetarian food is actually really good!  We had a Mexican meal catered for our wedding. Our guests raved about the meats and I really enjoyed the enchiladas and guacamole. The servers were good, the food was excellent, they went the extra effort to match their buffet display to our wedding colors, and the cost was far more reasonable than most wedding meals. If it hadn't been my wedding, I would have stuffed myself silly on the food it was so good.  I've also had the barbeque meal catering at a different event, and it was delicious! The servers were so accommodating as soon as they heard I was vegetarian (offering to grill up some other fare for me). The mac & cheese and biscuits were awesome.",

We chose baby back ribs and St. Luis, rotisserie style chicken, brisket, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and grilled vegetables. We got our food within 5 minutes. Everything was delicious and super tender. There wasn't anything we disliked. We both agreed the rotisserie chicken was our favorite...sooooo good.  And the mac and cheese..omg. We had so much meat we took half of it home. Everyone was really nice, as we walked out we were told \"thank you for coming in\" and \"have a good night\" by every employee we passed.

My boyfriend got the sliced BBQ brisket sandwich with cole slaw. We both really enjoyed the BBQ meat. The BBQ was a very sweet (but not overly sweet), and delicious. The fries were amazing, but my boyfriend said the cole slaw was kind of dry and bland. They serve cornbread before the meal and it's extremely moist and good - wasn't blown away by any means, but it was your standard cornbread.  My boyfriend also ordered the frozen lemonade which was so amazingly good! If you've had the frozen lemonade cups at a ball game or something of the like - it tastes just like that except better! Comes with a sugar rim.  I'd definitely go here again. The only complaint I have is that it is small (they have outdoor seating, but when we went there were tons of bugs - ew!) and LOUD. Our table was also super wobbly. Only complaints though. Also, reasonably priced! My boyfriend and I escaped under $30 (not counting tip).",

I was very impressed and changed my review to a 4.   Ill start off with the decor of the restaurant. I really liked it and felt welcomed. It felt like a more upscale BBQ joint.   We first ordered the Q rolls. These were simply amazing! They are brisket wrapped in tortilla then deep fried and accompanied by BBQ sauce and a chipotle mayo.   We also got homemade corn bread while we waited for our entree .  We then had a 3 meat combo.  We choose pork, brisket, and sausage. When it came to the actual BBQ I thought it was good, but not blown away great. I thought the sausage was over smoked and I'm not a fan of chopped brisket. I like my brisket cut into long pieces. The pulled pork was solid but again nothing blew me away.  I liked the man n cheese but honestly thought the garlic mash pataoes were a lil tasteless though. I added a lot of pepper to give them some taste.   Overall Bobby's was a great place to eat. The service was outstanding, our server was Shay. The Q rolls were amazing and the food was solid. I really liked the personal customer service after my wife's review. So the only thing keeping me from a 5 star rating is the actual BBQ. I will give it another chance and would like to try the ribs this time.",

    "text": "After my bf's graduation, him, his friends, his parents and I decided to have lunch here. This was my first time here but according to my bf this place is pretty good and he talked about it so many times that I thought I actually been here before. Well I finally got to try it.  I ordered the Platter since I really wanted to try more than just one type of meat if this is the only time I get to try it - so with the platter you get to select three types of meat plus one side. I ordered the beef brisket, bbq chicken (I requested the leg and thigh since I'm not a big fan of the breast) and sausage with the pecan cole slaw as the side. It also comes with corn bread.   They served us all the corn bread in a basket first and it was the softest corn bread I've ever had but it had a soft buttery taste - kind of just melted in your mouth - I really liked it. When my platter came I was somewhat disappointed because they gave me ribs instead of the sausage - but it was alright because I ended up really liking the ribs. It wasn't a lot of meat but the flavor was good. What I really really liked was the beef brisket. It was the softest beef brisket I have ever had. It was amazing because it was so easy to chew and the flavor was also very good. The BBQ chicken was okay - I liked it just because I could request for dark meat pieces but it didn't really have that strong of a BBQ taste. The coleslaw on the other hand was my least favorite. It wasn't very tasty and it lacked dressing too.   The services was pretty good - our waitress was friendly. The place itself was surprising dim - for a BBQ place and one thing I notice was usually when you step into a BBQ restaurant you would get hit in the face with a smokey bbq-y kind of smell however not here. When I stepped into the dining area - I didn't really smell any of that meaty bbq aroma - and not only that but my clothes didn't even absorb the smell of the restaurant. This isn't a good or bad thing - just an observation.   Overall I really enjoyed my lunch - for 13.99 the platter was fairly priced since everything on the menu (from sandwiches to salads to platters) was ranged around 10-14 dollars a plate.",

However, I think it can be a little pricey around $15-20 a person with a non alcoholic drink. Waitresses are beautiful and friendly. It really is great BBQ though if you are willing to spring for it. Warning: Thurs nights are hip hop nights. It attracts a mixed crowd, and a lot of ghetto crowd. The restaurant does a good job of keeping them behaved though.",

    "text": "I've been to Bobby Q's 4 times now and always have gone at Happy Hour. Why? Because it has a nice little menu. Today, two of us ate 3 appetizers and the bill was $14.  This is my go-to spot for West Phoenix (I live in Chandler). Depending on your goal Bobby Q's has it - nice bar, nice restaurant, and nice club on the side.  Club: I've gone to the club twice now on Friday (not sure the hours). Earlier in the night it is rather interesting (in a good way). The way that I describe it as - someone brought in their iPod and put it on shuffle. They play country, hip-hop, rap, alternative, oldies, rock, and disco all in one sitting. This makes for an interesting dynamic as many people who want to dance to Toby Keith's \"I love this bar\" probably don't want to dance to the follow-up song of Soulja Boy's \"Kiss me through the phone.\"  Except me of course - I stay and dance to whatever is playing.  With that said, the crowd is generally older. I was boogying down with a lady that was 70+ and having a ball. Later in the night (read: after 10pm) the crowd changes to an urban crowd and has a crowd that is complimentary to that music.",

    "text": "A good friend of mine -who's opinion on Q I highly respect- was in town a few months ago and stopped into Bobby Q's (BQ), and he couldn't stop raving about it. I've been jonesing all week to come check it out, but I figured I'd wait until my wife got into town. Well, I finally got my chance and I was giddy as a school girl. I was actually able to make a reservation through OpenTable on the Yelp app, and I'm sure glad we did. Upon our arrival at 5:30 the place was already packed, but by thetime we left at 7 there was a hoard of people flooding out into the street--and for good reason! Enough jibber-jabber--on to the food! I ordered the Three Meat Combo and that comes with two sides and some of BQ's Cornbread.  Sides:  Mac and Cheese- This might easily be the creamiest, most decadent Mac & Cheese I've ever had. They use something similar to Velveeta Cheese to coat it, and I'm not slamming Velveeta. It's so rich I couldn't finish it. 3.75*  Pecan Coleslaw- I'm very picky about my slaw; I don't want it too creamy, sweet, or bitter and this was absolutely perfect! I also loved the crunch you get from the little pieces of toasted Pecan they add to the top--I'm definitely adding that to my slaw the next time I make it. 5*  Cornbread- Excellent mix of a Northern/Southern cornbread--it has the cakiness and slight sweetness if Northern, and the crust and stone-ground corn like a Southern; I could eat these everyday. 5*   Meat:  St. Louis Ribs- These might be the best St. Louis Pork Ribs (other than mine) that I've ever had! The meat had a nice \"tug\" to it, but was still so tender, smokey and delicious! 5*  Beef Brisket- Juicy and flavorful this brisket was quite good--my only gripe is I wish it had a bit more smokiness to it. 4*  Pulled Pork- Another excellent job by BQ! Juicy, smoky and porky (just like me!) Everything you could want in Pulled Pork and then some. I piggled (sic) the whole lot of it! 5*  Dessert:  Sugar-Cinnamon Donuts- They give everyone at the table these tiny little donuts that they make fresh up front and they're fabulous; they had me at \"Cinnamon\". I guess you can just walk in and order a dozen for $3 if that's all your craving, too. 5*  Service & Ambiance- Good service from our server, Jessica. She was on top of things without being annoying. BQ is located in a building that looks like something you'd find in the middle of nowhere. The interior is mostly brick and wood causing the noise level in there to be deafening by the end of the night. They also keep it a bit too dark for my liking, but the decor is swell. 4*-service/3.5*-Ambiance  Value- The meals here are not a bad value, as my Three Meat Combo cost $22, but it's more than enough food for 2 people. Even my piggy self couldn't finish it--but guess what's for breakfast?! Snooch to the Nooch! 4*  I'm about to make a bold proclamation: I think BQ has *the* best BBQ I've ever had. I don't make that statement lightly either--after all, I have a reputation to uphold. I think this was easily the best meal I've had here in AZ, and that's saying something. I can't wait for my next visit to the Valley of the Sun so I can visit BQ again. If you ever find yourself in Phoenix, I highly, highly recommend making your way here--just make sure to make a reservation!",

There was a minor problem with our wait time and our seating and I was a little upset.  That did not last long. After talking to the amazingly awesome manager Taylor, he had us sitting at a perfect table and had two of his best waitresses Shauntel and Stacie waiting on us. Let me tell you that this was the best restaurant experience that I have ever had and I was Truelly impressed. Taylor, Shauntel, and Stacie went above and beyond to make my wife's birthday celebration a very memorable one. The food was just as amazing as the staff. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for the best BBQ in Phoenix!!!",

    "text": "Much happier than my last visit!  Busy Friday night. Quoted an hour plus wait time for first available seating. It was probably around 45 minutes but it was a really nice night out, so no stress.  Very friendly server was prompt with nice corn bread and frozen lemonades that had sugar rimmed around the glass. Yum.  We do their whole hog dinner every time because it's an amazing value. Beef brisket was tender and juicy. Baby backs and St. Louis ribs different from one another but both great. The pulled chicken was too sweet for my taste. I could be wrong but I think the portion (still stupid huge) has been cut back a bit.  Finally, finally, finally, after a nearly 30 year hiatus, I got to have their Death by Chocolate dessert. Having failed on prior visits was the reason for my mixed review. Well, I'll tell you, it is different from what I recall but, a whole lot of things from 30 years ago are different from what I remember. Straight up: big portion, fair price, decent ice cream, good cake and tasty frosting. I'm so happy right now!",

We found this place, which had several stellar reviews, and decided to give it a try.   I got the beef brisket sandwich and my wife got the pulled pork sandwich. I had a side of fries and she got a side of macaroni and cheese. Starting with mine, the beef brisket was amazing. It was well seasoned, they used incredibly soft, super fresh, potato rolls for the buns, and the order came out hot. The french fries were crisp and well seasoned.   The pulled pork that my wife had was good as well, however it was a little on the dry side, and probably could have used some more barbeque sauce. The macaroni and cheese was really good, and some of the creamiest I've ever had. As a starter, they also bring out cornbread which is hot, fresh and soft. It was quite excellent.   For drinks we both got some of their specials. The drinks were massive, well priced at only $10 apiece, and easily big enough to share! Our waiter was Mateo, and he was really friendly and helpful. If he's working, request him. The restaurant itself had a huge outdoor covered seating area with fans and a fountain. There was a nice breeze, and even though it was a hot day it was still comfortable to sit outside. We really enjoyed this place, and would definitely go back.",

The Mac & cheese is ooey gooey in the best way. To end the meal they bring fresh from the fryer cinnamon sugar mini donuts, and yep they're complimentary!

The hostess said the wai would be 40 minutes and suggested we have a drink at the bar, which we were happy to do. Our server at the bar Chelsea then set us up at a table by the bar and actually offered to just serve us there. She was incredibly friendly and her enthusiasm felt completely authentic. And after we got our meal I can see why. The food was AMAZING. We had the \"Whole Hog\" barbecue package which was four different types of meat and three sides and everything was great.

When my group got there, we were served very fast and they took our orders.  Service from the waitresses was GREAT!  Pros:  One great thing about this place is that they serve limitless CORNBREAD!  For a hungry team, this is amazing, especially before your food gets there.    Now to the food.  The FOOD is great quality.  I loved the flavor of the ribs and bbq sauce.  The mac-n-cheese wasn't the best, but it was good.  I would say the spare-ribs were better than the beef ribs here.   What was also nice was that they let us split checks which made it a lot easier for us to pay.  They waitresses also gave us complimentary doughnuts which is awesome.    CONS: When I went here, the portions of the meals weren't what we were expecting for the price.  A few of my teammates ordered the two rib meal and they didn't get much food.  We had to ask if there was a mistake because there was such little food for the price.  The manager(?) came and apologized and said they ran out of ribs?  I don't know exactly how valid this excuse is, but whatever.  I think that for an establishment such as this, it should have been a bit more prepared considering we did have reservations.  This is probably the reason why I am not giving them a full 5 stars.  I know the experience might have been different under different conditions.  Hopefully next time, our experience might be a bit better food quantity wise.",

The portions are huge and easily shareable, plus the sides are SO good! I tried the macaroni and mashed potatoes and they were both great along with the corn bread which comes before your meal. They also give you mini doughnuts with your check which were again super good. The service was also great, I don't remember our server's name but he was super attentive and recommended a bunch of items on the menu.

    "text": "I literally left Bobby Q's last night thinking, I need to bring anyone and everyone I know from out of town here when they visit us.  Here's why:  Almost immediately after seating us at the booth at the bar (the wait was 50 minutes for a table vs immediate for the bar), the waitress showed up to greet us and get our drinks, and soon after brought us their oh-so-delicious cornbread.  We were set on the Whole Hog Heaven, which was a choice of 4 meats and 3 sides, but seeing that it was only me and my boyfriend. our waitress (I feel terrible for not remembering her name) suggested the Sunday special called the Family Platter which was for $33, you get a little less meat than the Whole Hog, 4 pre-chosen meats: chicken, brisket, pulled pork, and baby back ribs, and 2 sides.  Less than 10 minutes after placing our order, our food was here with an extra helping of spicy BBQ sauce.  It was marvelous.  The mac and cheese was the creamiest, cheesiest, most delicious mac and cheese my 10 year old self could ever ask for.  The shoestring fries were miserably thin, but I'm just biased being a fan of steak fries.  The brisket simply melts in your mouth.  The pulled pork does too, but only as much as pulled pork can.  The chicken was a lot better than I expected and I hate ordering BBQ chicken.  Oh but those ribs, the meat just fell right off the bone.  We were starving walking in, but stuffed after polishing off everything but the ribs.  My boyfriend, who had every intention of eating all of it right there and then, took a bite of the ribs, announced that we were going to take it home.  It was that good.  And that much food.  My only regret was not getting more cornbread.  But I can't really blame them for not offering considering how quickly they brought us that sheer amount of food.  In a nutshell, great, quick, and very accommodating service (the couple next to us wanted rotisserie chicken without any BBQ sauce.  Baffling, I know), delicious food, and tons of it!  But be sure to make a reservation.  Oh, and have I mentioned those cinnamon-dusted donut bites?  Bobby Q, you've ruined me forever.  I used to be very content with my after-dinner mints but now I'm going to have to demand donut bites everywhere I go.",

    "text": "Bobby Q - we love you - but Thursday night was an off night. We enjoyed the brisket, perfect hamburger, q rolls, macaroni and cheese, roasted corn, and complementary donuts. Honestly, I eat Bobby Q's for the q rolls and the donuts, I think some of their other dishes are standard issue. My dining companion would point out that the food has a smoke quality that BBQ eaters love. I do not consider myself a BBQ person so I evaluate flavors without the analysis of smoke or BBQ. Thus, I enjoy the brisket, q rolls, and donuts - for their genuine flavor of the food itself. We were returning to Phoenix for a visit and made a list of the places we had to eat while in town. This is one of them! I hate to say this but we visited on a Thursday night and things were just off. My heartbreaks over this review because the only reason I am giving them 4 stars and not 3 is because I have had prior experiences that were 5 star quality.",

The baby back rips were spot on, the pulled pork was nice and moist, and the brisket had very little fat on it. The side were all fantastic as well. Extra cheesy Mac and Cheese and fluffy mashed potato's. This was all washed down with there house beer, which was a Red from Sedona Brewing. No complaints at all on the food.  The service was also great! My pops was in town from Florida so we all went out and our server was more then accommodating the kids and all of our needs. He did a fantastic job, and had several other tables besides ours.   Plus you get a little bonus before and after your meal. Bonus number 1, 10% off your bill when you do a yelp check in. Bonus 2, corn bread brought to you before your meal. Bonus 3, after your meal you get cinnamon  donuts.   I am looking forward to going back and thankfully this is one of the few BBQ places that is a reasonable distance from my house.",

My wife had the brisket sandwich which was better, but again, the meat just tastes mushy and not tender. For the price, I would assume it would be higher quality. I'm sure there are other amazing items on the menu, but we were 0-2 on what we ordered.",

The only time I have ever been here is for a quick food tasting and other than that was not expecting to be back or try the food again until the wedding.  My parents decided to treat my fiance and I to a dinner here and I can't even begin to explain how amazing everything was.  Not just the food, but the service as well.  Our server, Joey, went above and beyond and was exceptional.  There was an error with our food in the system so they were running behind and the manager, Jack came over to us personally to apologize and told us he was giving us 50% off our bill for the inconvenience. The service continued to be amazing even after that and they even brought us out a free plate of Q rolls for the inconvenience to keep our stomachs full until the food came.  Needless to say, I am THRILLED we chose this place to cater our wedding and I have no doubt it will be anything less than perfect.  As for the food.... well I'll let the pictures speak for themselves.  Speechless.  Thank you Joey, Jack and Bobby Q for an amazing experience.  You guys rock",

Sauces were full of flavor but some of the meat wouldn't even need it since they were knock outs all on their own. I'd love to visit the area again and stop to eat here without a doubt.",

Baby back  ribs were great good flavor and the meat fell of the bones . St Louis  ribs were tender but a little salty. Corn on the cob was not on the cob and had too much butter . Cole slaw was average . Good portions  . First time eating  at the restaurant  in a long time.i would definitely try again . Our chicken was a little burnt.  Desert mud pie was very good and large enough  for 4 of us",

I'm so happy we came. Our server was super attentive, friendly and helpful. The food was fresh and oh so delicious! Corn bread to start and fresh donuts for a free dessert to finish, which are a churro lovers dream come True! The family had bbq and I enjoyed the Mac n cheese with shoestring fries since those are my favorite things to eat. Towards the end of our visit manager Jack came over to chat and invited us back anytime. We got 10% off the bill just for checking in on Yelp which is awesome  highly recommend this place if you are ever in the Phoenix area! Thank you Bobby Q's for a fantastic visit,the great country music and comfortable atmosphere! Your team is awesome! Keep up the great work! Peace , love  and BBQ !",

I order the trifecta plate(not sure if that's the real name). Chicken, ribs and brisket...it's so, so good! The brisket is so juicy and flavorful. The chicken it always cooked to perfection. The ribs are not fatty, and have a substantial amount of meat in them. The side dishes are good but it's the meat that you can't forget!   Oh...they have the coolest thing in a restaurant! A mini donut maker! At the end of your dinner they bring you hot...mini cinnamon and sugar donuts! As if you have room! I have no shame in my game...I tell them I'm from Cali and I need additional orders for the road. That always throw in extras for me. So nice!   This is a hidden gem!!!! I have friend in AZ who refused to go to dinner with me for almost 6 years. They finally went 2 years ago for a gathering. I received a call that night! They were so apologetic for have blown me off for years about Bobby's!   Now they go there all the time!",

I ordered the lunch rib special which came with cornbread, a side (I picked Mac & cheese) and a complimentary dessert (cinnamon sugar mini donuts). All meats were aged for a few weeks and smoked for almost a day so the ribs I ordered were very tender and flavorful. The Mac & cheese was unlike any I've had before - a LOT of cheese (maybe too cheesy) and only a little mac... The freshly made cinnamon sugar mini donuts were still hot when served and tasted delicious!",

Our server Jeremiah was fantastic he told us about the restaurant and about the BBQ and how it is prepared. Inside is warm with a western cowboy theme.  Now here's the rub....I don't like barbecue! So what was I doing there? I was with two relatives from KC who are BBQ enthusiasts.  They split the two meat platter with 2 sides and they also added a salad. They said the pulled pork was fantastic! The brisket was good but not fall off the bone melt in your mouth like some, they concluded it must have just been that batch.  I ordered the smokehouse burger with no BBQ sauce and sauteed mushrooms on the side.  The burger is huge! And includes onion strings and thick thick bacon.  It was juicy and cooked perfect medium probably one of my top 10 burgers ever! The \"secret sauce\" which is usually some terrible aioli or thousand island concoction, theirs is a garlic butter on the toasted bun, so good.  Shoestring fries the best I ever had, some places they are so thin all you taste is grease not here.  How is it that I hate BBQ and this is one of my new favorite restaurants??",

The hostesses are friendly and prompt and work very hard to help patrons with whatever questions they have. The wait staff is super friendly to tourists like ourselves and although food comes slow it's worth the wait. I will say if you are vegan or vegetarian by any means stay away this is definetly a meat friendly environment haha! The only reason i did not rate a 5 is the location, althouh a spectacular building parking is a little awkward and getting to the restaurant via highway takes some work maneuvering. Go here for great bbq and friendly staff. Pre-warning make reservations (yelp is the go to) and go after 730 or before 3!   Bobby Qs thanks for another great meal!",

OMG it was incredibly juicy and tender and tasty. They offered us different sauces. We went with the Carolina sauce.   And the service was spot on. Everyone greeted us and was super friendly. These folks know \"customer service\". They made you feel like they're so happy you chose to come to their place.",

The cornbread, which is served before the meal, was a favorite of mine. The end of the meal concluded with a bag of cinnamon sugar doughnuts . What could be better?! It was a great meal.   Hog heaven , which is a meal on the menu, is suggested to feed 2 or 3 people. But this can easily feed 4, especially if You have no large eaters. ON Sunday's , they serve a Similar meal for a lower cost .   My family was looking for a nice sit-down meal that was not far from Grand Canyon University, so we were excited to find such a Nice restaurant within 10 minutes of the college.  The food, as well as the atmosphere, gets 5 stars. We will definitely return!",

I have to say of all the BBQ joints this is the best one I've been to.  I would highly recommend the BBQ platters from a two rib combo or three meat combo of your party is 2-3 ppl. My dad went to town on the meats and I cleaned house on the ribs. I normally prefer baby back (usually my favorite) but the St. Lois ribs were especially good here. I heard really good things about the Q rolls but unfortunately wasn't able to try it. If I'm ever in the area in AZ again, I will def make sure to come through again to try the Q rolls along and enjoy the most amazing ribs I've ever had!",

I ordered the pulled pork and received a rather dry pile of shredded pork topped with a dollop of barbecue sauce. The vegetables on the side had this intense, artificial \"liquid smoke\" smell that was so strong I almost could not eat them. The other side dish I ordered was the mac-and-cheese, which tasted of the Kraft variety. The menu said it had three cheeses in it, mine had a chunk of unmelted cheddar in the middle that was not very appetizing.  The other people I was eating with liked their food. One ordered baby back ribs and the other had some kind of a roast. Typical overpriced American fare.",

Shoutout to our server TOMMY, he was awesome and helpful, went extra mile to provide good service. For starters we had the signature Q Rolls...so bomb especially dipped in bbq sauce.  Also tried the two rib combo with the baby back and beef ribs - the baby back ribs were truly fall-off-the-bone, both were good and I'm usually a fan of beefy ribs more.  Also had to try the catfish fillet (breaded & comes with 2 large pieces), which was good too.  I think we liked everything we ate. All entrees/combos come with homemade cornbread and 2 sides each. The CORNBREAD was definitely a highlight of the meal! Some good sides were the potato salad, pecan Cole slaw and roasted corn.    I guess they always hook you up with complimentary donuts for dessert here too! ALL IN ALL...GLAD WE CAME TO BOBBY Q!",

A couple weeks ago, we celebrated a co-worker's birthday here, and although we were outside when it rained, we didn't have to worry about getting soaked. The beers were quite tall, and the food was excellent! Along with ordering the pulled pork mini-burritos and wings, we were also given small sacks of fresh cooked mini-donuts. Nowhere have I gone to, have those been served; you wouldn't think of a BBQ place serving such delectable little donuts!  In regard to the music, I can't say I've been there but did have a DJ friend there recently headline there for a Thursday night. The set up looks good, for being outside of Downtown Phoenix and Old Town Scottsdale.  Can highly recommend if not for the BBQ, at least for the small sacks of fresh donuts!",

    "text": "Amazing service from the moment I walked in until I walked out. The setting and environment is very comfortable and inviting.  The food... is above an \"ok\" but it is over priced. On a scale of 1 to 10... overall a generous 7 (because of the selection). Ranch beans are delicious but could be served hotter. The corn bread is yummy and moist. The potato salad is creamy and very flavorful (you better like dill). The brisket was moist and tender but the sauce was a little bland for me (I like more heat). The baby back ribs were over cooked. In fact, I didn't like the ribs.  In summary, the price is almost worth it for the service and setting but let's be honest... I can't eat either of those.  $31 for a 2 meat combo and a beer.",

Warm, scrumptious complimentary corn bread arrives to begin your meal. The extensive menu offers a vast variety of savory entrees from platters to sandwiches and salads and an excellent selection of side dishes. Be sure to try the roasted corn and the  macaroni and cheese. At the conclusion of your meal, they deliver a brown paper bag of freshly made warm mini sugar donuts!   Maddie was our server this evening and she was delightful--very friendly, attentive, professional and offered great suggestions about popular menu items. She provided superb service. Thanks, Maddie, for your attention to detail and for excellent service! The manager actively greeted each table and checked to see that all patrons were enjoying their dining experience.  We made advance reservations (highly recommended) and were served promptly.  Great place for families.  A bit of an elevated noise level because this place is very popular among the locals--a hidden gem!",

Now I had to fast one of the hubby's St Louis ribs.  Oh my goodness - I was sad we didn't get a rack of those for my dessert.  It was soooo good!!!   So 3 days later I am here for the ribs & that Mac n cheese. I am trying the Cajun shrimp as a starter which I always get the onion block.  Maybe new favorites to unveil today! Will be continued....",

It took a while to get our drinks. The table got cornbread before the drinks came. Cornbread was a bit dry and I had nothing to help me wash it down so I kept coughing until drinks came.  On a side note I would've liked some corn bread for my side of the table. We ordered the whole hog feast. Baby back ribs were delicious, chicken was dry, brisket was ok. The sides were all good. When our check arrived it was separate tabs but combined in the same folder for the table, I didn't appreciate the sharing of financial information like that. Our bill had mandatory 20% tip since we had a table of 9 and was calculated based on the total with tax which I do not think is right. I did not receive my receipt back and did not receive a to go bag of donuts.  Maybe with fewer people the service would've been better. I don't know if I will try again.",

Our waitress came and told us the history of the place since it was our first time. Our waitress was quick, attentive, and very kind. If only more places had waitresses like her.  We started off with an appetizer of the Q-Rolls (suggested by our waitress). They were so tender and the dipping sauces were so good. Best BBQ sauce I ever had.  We ordered our lunch. My boyfriend had their smokehouse burger with shoestring fries and I had the slices BBQ prime beef brisket sandwich with Mac and cheese. The brisket was so tender and the Mac and cheese was really good. I had a bite of my boyfriend's burger and that was the best burger I've ever had- and I'm not a big burger person. Before we left, our waitress gave us their homemade sugar donuts which are soooo delicious.  The atmosphere inside and out is great and the staff are really friendly. The manager came around and made sure everyone was doing okay which I think is a nice touch. This place is pretty pricey but it is so worth it. We'll definitely come back but probably for special occasions on",

The hostess seated me and it took about 10 minutes before a waiter showed up. The restaurant was about 1/2 full and the waiter said he didn't see me seated. I ordered the smoasted chicken plate with beans, cole slaw and cornbread along with a salad. The salad arrived first and was good. What I didn't like was that the entree arrived just a few minutes later and I hadn't finished my salad and I am not a slow eater. I hurried to finish the salad because I didn't want to food to get cold.   The chicken was average size and looked just like chicken that I cook on the grill. The cole slaw had pecans on it and was very good (4). I liked the beans too and graded them at a 3.5. The salad was good also and I gave it a 3. I liked the chicken but felt it only deserved a 3. Not bad but I have had many examples that were better. That's why my overall score for the meal is a 3.  Perhaps my tardy waiter and the fact that the timing of the service was off were a fluke. I believe this is a good restaurant and probably is closer to a 3.5 or maybe even a 4. However that was my experience.",

They have a funky location off I-17 so you need to exit and drive the frontage road to find the place. Once you arrive, you will not only smell the smoke, but you will enjoy the unique decorations and friendly atmosphere. The restaurant is huge which is good for groups.  The baby back ribs were just amazing. Sweet, smoky goodness falling apart with all the fight long cooked away. They also serve brisket egg rolls, fall apart cornbread, and super cheesy mac and cheese. The Q Rolls were a special treat since the flavor of the meat survives the deep fryer and is a very unique item. The bag of fresh mini doughnuts at the end of the meal is a nice touch and a tasty ride home.  Their location is a little tough if you have to fight traffic on a weeknight, and there is really not much else around. Prices are a bit high, but you are paying for good barbecue. I really like this place and am glad to have it on my trips to Phoenix!",

I would say Bobby Q's is more like Kansas City style than anything else.  They drown the sauce all over the meats, in which hides the True flavors of the smoked meats.  I have heard about this place many times, and finally gave it a try since my co-worker raved about this place, and said it was voted as one of the best in AZ.  In which, I respectfully disagree BIG TIME.  That honor would go to Little Miss BBQ in Phoenix.  I would say even Rudy's, Joe's, and Famous Dave's is far superior.  So let's get into my review.  I came to this place on a Saturday afternoon with my wife and my brother.  We noticed the building off the I-17, it felt older and had a BBQ smell about it, in which I enjoyed.  The dining room was dark and  had an older feel to it.  We decided to sit outside.  One thing that I did notice is the chairs are very old and falling apart.  I had to move some chairs around cause a few of them had BBQ stains on them.  Anyways, I'm at a BBQ joint, so I don't let that stuff bother me, it's almost to be expected.  We ordered the Hog Heaven and fried chicken dish.  The Hog Heaven consisted of half a rack of spare ribs, 2 beef ribs, some pulled pork, and prime brisket.  It also came with 3 sides in which we ordered shoe string potatoes, mac and cheese and a baked potato.  There was also corn bread for the table.  My wife enjoyed her fried chicken dish, but thought the sides were a little bland and mashed potatoes could of used more butter and salt.  My experience  with the Hog Heaven was just ok.  When enjoying BBQ, I normally don't like ribs completely falling off the bone, and the pulled pork was completely doused with sauce, and the brisket was extremely tender.  I'm not trying to be a BBQ snob, but I like \"competition style\" BBQ.  Ribs should be tender, but hold up.  You should be able to take a bite and not completely fall off the bone, and the same with brisket.  It should be able to pull it apart and be tender and moist on the pallet.  The brisket completely fell apart and was too covered with too much BBQ sauce.  We were served two beef ribs, but one barely had any meat on it, (See Picture).  For 50.00 for the Hog Heaven, I truly didn't feel it was worth the price.  The sides were ok, but how hard is it to screw up fries, and a baked potato.  The mac and cheese was good though.  Overall, our experience was ok, nothing to rave about, but I'm glad I had a chance to experience Bobby Q and see what all the fuss was about.  In conclusion, I'm more of a sauce on the side kind of guy.  I truly enjoy BBQ and enjoy the smoked flavor and the tenderness of the meats.  The sauce should be on the side and help accentuate the meat, not completely covering the meats.  Why smoke BBQ for 6 to 15 hours if you are just going to ruin the flavor?  In the area, there aren't a lot of great BBQ places, but I would give this place another shot, I would just order the sauce on the side.  I love's Joe BBQ in gilbert, but I've had a bad experience, where the meat was a little dry, so I would give this a try again.",

I thought it would be sweet but it was kind of spicy...in a good way. I had the steak sandwich and my partner had the brisket sandwich. And it was cooked to our liking and the meats were tender.

    "text": "Okay so I recently left a review for Bobby q but it was actually for q lounge. So my birthday was a few weeks ago so I decided you know I'm going to stop in to barbecue and I'm going to try out the food. It was amazing. I got the brisket short rib and their chicken boneless chicken I believe it's pulled chicken. I got some mac on the side, so baked beans shot the cornbread was on point. Of course I went there was a group but I think all of us would say the same thing that Bobby q is a must go to. I would also add I like the atmosphere of it, slightly dim lights the staff was really attentive oh, I'm pretty sure maybe the manager came out just to see how everything was going which was dope. But I would like to add one interesting little story. There was a couple and their kid having a meal I and I believe it might have been his birthday also what up do babies. And I believe that whatever she ordered came out a little bit more rare than she wanted. So she was putting up like a front about rate they ruined the day like why can't places get stuff right and the whole time I was like this is funny because like two seconds ago and they were jumping on appetizers I think I was trying to talk to his wife and she was like don't you see me enjoying this good food. And once the food came out the way that she wanted it she was on the same thing she was enjoying it loving it but when the staff came through she was acting like it wasn't that great. Husband seemed really irritated with her because he was like you know you like it I'm over here listening to her complain and I'm like lady you like it sounded like you like it when you eating the food like why you got to put up a front. Anyway to the staff to have to deal with her I just want to say your food is amazing and I am for sure going back and thank you for the amazing birthday meal",

    "text": "Let's just say...WOW! Every aspect of our dining experience at Bobby Q was amazing. The meal starts with endless corn bread, which falls apart in your mouth. The portions are extremely generous, so try not to fill up on appetizers (which are also amazing, by the way). The brisket, pulled chicken, steak fried chicken; and burger were equally delicious!! And the sides are difficult to choose from and will definitely not disappoint!! I'm confident that you can't go wrong with anything on this menu!! Would definitely go back and recommend to all family and friends!! Would go back 10 times out of 10!",

And ALL the sides I've tried are delicious: corn, mashed potatoes, shoe string fries, mac n' cheese...perfect! The Q rolls appetizer are a must-get appetizer with the Chipotle sauce! Service is always great too!   The Q Lounge next door seems like it would be a fun place to go post meal as well. We didn't go but it looked like it was bumpin' and they played some good music!",

    "text": "Found this place on Yelp while in town on business today.  Looked like the place was run down and on the way to being washed up when I pulled up into the parking lot.  Turns out that \"run down BBQ shack\" is the look that they were shooting for!  The inside is another matter.  Obviously a BBQ place.  But a very nice one indeed.  Nicer and with more personality than Famous Dave's or Lucille's.  If this is a chain, it doesn't feel like it.  I sat at the bar (as I usually do when traveling).  They have indoor and outdoor seating.  Both looked comfortable and fairly well lit.  And the place is CLEAN; including the restrooms!  The staff i dealt with was friendly and attentive without getting on your nerves.  Obviously experienced and well trained.  I had the baby back ribs with mac & cheese, and grilled vegetables.  The ribs were meaty and tender with an excellent BBQ sauce.  Meat came off the bone easily.  I ate them with a fork with no problem.  The meal came with good cornbread and butter.  The Mac & cheese was creamy and delicious.  And the vegetables were grilled just right without being too soft.  Don't be put off by the rustic appearance of Bobby Q's.  This is a well run restaurant that gets plenty of business.  And they should.  They have a smoker on premises, and smoke their ribs and brisket for the better part of a day.  They also dry age their own beef on premises.  I was told that the rib eye is superb.  But that will have to wait for another day.  If you like BBQ, I just don't see how you could have a bad experience here.",

    "text": "First off, two warnings.   Do not visit this place if you are on a diet.   Seriously, you will gain 3 pounds before you get back to your car. No amount of good intention will save you.   And do not expect to enjoy this amazing BBQ restaurant if you are a strict vegetarian. I mean, whut fer?  I read a few \"reviews\" for Bobby Q that made me wonder why the writers chose a very well known down-home style BBQ emporium, and then expected that the experience would mimic a Chez Souci foo-foo eatery. Huh?  Whatever!  First off, make a reservation before arriving!   Everybody in Central AZ knows this awesome joint, so you will not be lonely.   Or, if you enjoy having a few drinks before dinner just show up, leave your name at the desk, and taxi on over to the Adult Beverage area.  Lots of fun folks to talk to while waiting, so its painless.  They serve appetizers at the bar, if you need a head start.   Crazy crowded it was - a tour bus with 49 people pulled up as we arrived.  Even so, we were seated at a table within 40 minutes.  Another warning:  If you are having a main course dinner, remember that the hot chow rockets out of their kitchen in 5 minutes flat (being a rotisserie and pit BBQ place, most of it is ready and waitin').   The servers are all super friendly and most efficient. The warm corn bread and butter hits your table immediately.  What's waitin', you ask?  Well just about anything you ever saw Barbecued, that's what.  Incredible slabs of ribs. Fantastic pulled pork. Amazing brisket. Chicken like you wish Mom could have made. Corn served country style (you'll see what I mean).    The huge stack of food (for any meal ordered) will blow your mind and stretch your belt. Even if you arrived hungry as a bear, you can expect to walk out with a plate of leftovers (and house-made corn bread). Believe me on that.  Yep - you will get messy (they provide wet naps) and will have to deal with some degree of consumption guilt on the ride home.   BUT ITS WORTH IT!",

I love a great steak, since I was raised in a Slaughting Ranch in Mexico with my Grandparents.   I know a great steak.  Paloma was our wonderful waitress, very knowledgeable about the the manner in which they age the beef, when they cut the steaks, and with what they grill it.  When the steak arrived it was accompanied by grilled vegetables, and a loaded baked potato, which the exterior had been rolled in seasalt while baking.  The steak was grilled perfectly, mouth watering tender piece of heaven.  I would be remiss if I do not mention the rolls of tender Brisket snuggled in a deep fried flour tortilla, it had a wonderful taste of Carne Machaca, so tasty.  We completed the scrupulous dinner with a very light dessert of a pineapple drink.  The drink arrived in a beautiful hollowed out pineapple.  The drink was so refreshing and yet not too sweet.  Donny, the Manager was so hospitable, made us feel like family, or regulars.  We will return.  I would highly recommend making a reservation.  Thank you for a memorable graduation gift.  Delia,",

The BBQ is definitely one of the best we've had in Arizona and it's definitely worth taking a drive out to. The only reason that I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating was because our waitress was terrible she might've been having a bad day because she was really sweet but she completely forgot my drink and my husband's shrimp and fries with his meal after being reminded. When they finally brought it out the shrimp tasted off like plastic almost. Everyone has off days but that's just unacceptable.

    "text": "After a long week of hard work,  my daughter and I always make a point to get together and have a nice dinner on Friday nights. We always struggle trying to find a new restaurant  to add to our short list of favorites. BobbyQ made that list longer last night.  We arrived at 7:15 on a Friday night. This place was hopping. There was parking readily available so I thought we would get in right away.  There were at least 40 people waiting for seating when we approached to hostess stand. She very kindly took my name and told me I would be seated in 1 hr and 15 mins. After having a light lunch, that was a long wait. So, I asked about the bar seating and was told find a spot and its yours. I hovered around the bar and found an open patio bar spot with 2 seats open. It was perfect. Plenty of space, no jockeying for elbow room. No talking over our neighbors. Absolutely perfect. Our bartender Chris was very attentive. I told him we were newbies and on a busy night he told us the story BobbyQ. He told us his favorite foods and got us some water. Said any of the 3 bartenders would take our order.   We picked the whole hog heaven,  lots of food for 2 people, but allowed us to try 2 styles of ribs, 1/2 rotisserie chicken, and brisket. Also 3 side dishes for $48 bucks. There was so much food, we brought 80% home.   The service: we were immediately served the complimentary cornbread. We ordered 2 strawberry lemonade and they were great. I thought I would be charged 4 bucks each but for these speciality drinks but they were 2.50. I pay that for a Coke in most places.   Settled in our seats and within mins our food arrived. And it was impressive. We enjoyed our dinner and asked for to go boxes. We packed our food and the store manager appeared ready to pack our boxes in BobbyQ shopping bag. He also brought the complimentary cinnamon donuts. Hot and yummy, we loved it. Thanks BobbyQ for a great Friday night! We will be back!  Notes: if you sit at the bar for dinner look for the outside patio seating. Not a huge fan of the Mac and cheese. Everything else Great! We'll be back!",

Instead another younger kid came over and said \"hi I'll take care of you, the other guy got flustered and is gone\"! We didn't ask why or what but you must admit that's a bit weird no?  Anyway this new waiter kid was good, he did take good care of us in the end :)  Um the food was ok, good, decent, average.. No negative remarks about the actual food or even the place. I guess the only downfall is that it's located In a ghetto-esque neighborhood. And also they are overpriced. To me they are charging as if they are a fine dining spot, which they are not. It's a casual restaurant in a Not so great location. So yea no.  I might go back for a mai tai one day as That was the highlight of my evening there. Thanks.",

    "text": "I don't give five star reviews for barbeque restaurants lightly. I'm from Kansas. And Kansas City BBQ is in my blood. That being said... This place has some amazing food. I had the St Louis Style ribs and the sliced brisket and it was amazing. Smoked and grilled to perfection. Just the right amount of bark on the brisket. Delicious ribs that almost fall off the bone. So good that I'm salivating thinking about it a day later.    We also got the Barbeque Egg roll appetizer and it was delicious. The wrap for these rolls is a puff pastry that is fried around their delicious brisket. Dipping sauces are both wonderful. I really enjoyed the nice sweet smokiness of their regular BBQ sauce. The chipotle ranch is also quite good.  No complaints from anyone at our table. Southern Fried Chicken looked amazing. My wife got the pulled pork sandwich and let me taste... It was really good.  I just don't think you can go wrong here. The only downside is the price. You can easily drop $25 per person here, but it's money well spent on a damn fine meal.   Possibly the best BBQ in Phoenix. Easily the best I've had since living here and I've been trying them all. You should go here... Your wallet might regret it but YOU won't.",

    "text": "Went out on a date Friday night, again he picked the place, and it was a non-chain place, which scored him some points, but Bobby Q's gives the feeling a chain place, I have never been and I never knew about the Bobby McGee's that used to be there, I'm not from Arizona, and wasn't around during that time.     After I went to Bobby Q's I actually looked at some the reviews from fellow yelpers and man I am sorry I missed out on the roasted corn, I am going to have to try that next time I go!  Our server's Melissa was a good, but she got tractable, like we made bets to see how long it would take before she came back to our table to check on us, it was about every 10 mins. Now don't get me wrong I love good service, but there is a difference between being pushy and good.  Like I have said before, Im a visual person and when I saw on the drink menu that yummy looking drink called Strawberry Qlada, I knew I had to get that, when it came to the table, it was just as beautiful in person, pinks, red, white, pineapple & cherry garish, it was a delish drink!  The round corn breads were a sweet surprise! I love me some cornbread! And with the whipped butter, what could be better, other than drowning them in hot bowl of chili!   I ordered the 8oz center cut top sirloin with mac & cheese, ranch beans & mushrooms & onions for my steak!   I had asked Melissa if she liked the mac & cheese and she is it was the bestselling item on the menu, oh that's good, but that didn't answer my question lol but I wound up ordering them anyways, and they were good, but it wasn't great! Yes it's made with 5 different cheese, its creamy and it's like eating velveeta mac n cheese, not my fav but if that's your thing, then it's up your alley! The ranch beans were good, it was little peppery and sweet, which is a great combo for me!  The steak was the perfect amount for me! It was cooked to perfection, it was tender and tasty! The mushrooms and onions were sauteed just right, not too soft not to hard!     Had I read reviews I would have known at the end of the meal they give us some sweet donuts! How cool is that! Any places that offers sweet little donuts is alright with me!",

    "text": "Over the years that I've lived in AZ, I've driven by this restaurant many times. It's barely visible from I-17.  It's name reminded me of a chain back in So Cal know as Bobby McGee's which was so, so - so . . . I wasn't particularly eager to give it a try, that is, until ready other reviews here on Yelp.    It is indeed quite pricey especially for a BBQ joint but it has a cool vibe with a large outdoor brick wall patio and an inviting interior. It reminds me of visiting somebody's home but entering through the backyard.  The BBQ is pretty good in my humble opinion.  I'm not from a BBQ state but I've been lucky to sample some good fare in places like North Carolina, Texas and even Colorado.  Bobby Q's is really tasty and well prepared.  Always tender, perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection.  As others have mentioned, their portions are quite sizable which makes them perfect for sharing which in turn brings the per serving price down.    This is a great place for a large family celebration but order carefully or you'll end up with a huge bill and a lot of leftovers.",

    "text": "Where do I start?!?  Made reservations for 5:45pm and arrived right on time and was seated promptly right at the side by side tables in front of the bar.  It wasn't too busy but there were plenty of patrons in the restaurant.   Jared was our server and he was LEGIT!! We were welcomed by him and asked if we had ever been to a Bobby Q's to which the answer was no. He gave a quick background about the restaurant chain and how it came about. Advised their angus steaks are aged 60 days and cut in-house and their BBQ meats are smoked for 22hrs (Pretty sure those were the timeframes but I could be wrong). Went over the menu and gave the drink menu.   Started out with the Cajun Shrimp appetizer  -shrimp not over cooked -sauteed in butter cajun seasoning and beer -garlic bread  Holy crap this was soooo good!! The shrimp was \"juicy\" which is not something I would ever describe shrimp as but I'm not quite sure how else to describe it. It was DELICIOUS and not tough or chewy. I'm a sauce fanatic and I literally wanted to drink the sauce out of the dish but didn't think that was appropriate so I opted to just dip the garlic bread in the sauce   The cornbread was dense and sweet and didn't fall apart - yummmmy  Dinner came out within 10 min, right after the shrimp was finished. I got the pick 2 meats as suggested by Jared because I couldn't decide between the beef brisket or the pulled pork - and with the pick 2 I got both!!  The pulled pork was my FAVORITE of the 2. It was fall off the fork tender and melted in my mouth. Again since I'm a sucker for good sauce I asked for more BBQ sauce to which Jared brought out both spicy and regular. The spicy wasn't too spicy at all and had just the perfect amount of \"spice\", that was my favorite of the two BBQ sauces.  I dipped my potato in the bbq sauce and even my mac and cheese it was so good I could drink it!  For my sides I had the loaded baked potato without chives and the mac and cheese.  Baked Potato - The skin was baked with salt which is my fav!!  I asked for a side of butter since it came with just sour cream, bacon bits and shredded cheese. It was good but just a standard baked tater and since I seem to love extra condiments I personally could have went for more sour cream and cheese but I'm not going to complain. My friend had the ranch baked beans and next time those are what I will get in place of the baked potato.   Mac n cheese -creamy and thick. Rich in flavor but not too rich - I loved it and will def order again  Let me tell you how much I loved the music!! It included 80's pop Deniece Williams-Let's hear it for the boy, Motown; The Supremes, 80's rock; Loverboy-Turn me loose, Katrina and the Waves-Walkin on sunshine, Dusty Springfield-Son of a Preacher Man, Wild Child-Play that funky music white boy, Evelyn King-love come down, Queen and the list of awesome music goes on and on!!  Had a perfect front row view of the 76ers vs Rockets game and all.   Christy, one of the managers came to check on us about halfway through dinner to make sure everything was great and make sure everything was acceptable   Lots of drink choices and I couldn't choose just 1, so I got 3 :-)  Watermelon cooler with tajin rim - Strong but delicious   Q-lada -Toasted coconut rim with some type of coconut cream and Pieces of strawberries blended  Cannot taste any alcohol in it with the light rum and it was super delicious and refreshing   Pineapple Passion - Served in a frozen pineapple with a dried pineapple slice and tangerine slice Creamy and strong but delicious - similar to a pina colada  Between the busser(s) and Jared, the empty plates were cleared promptly   Dessert, I was so full from shoveling all the delicious eats in my face but, I couldn't pass up their dessert!!  I got the banana sub zero square with warm caramel drizzle.  It's frozen banana pudding with a graham cracker walnut cinnamon bottom crust (I think that's what the crust was, that's what it tastes like). It was also very good but I could only eat a few bites and opted for a to go box to enjoy later.   Christy came by after we finished dessert to see how everything was and even got my dessert to go box!  Never felt rushed at any point throughout dinner/drinks/dessert.   I didn't want to leave and felt like I could hangout here all night!! But, after 2 hours I figured I better get my a$$ up so other people can enjoy this place just as much as I did!!  Just when you think it cannot get any better, our check showed up with a bag of FRESH, HOT donuts fried in peanut oil and covered in cinnamon sugar!!  OMG! I couldn't wait to eat them later even though I had ZERO space for anything else. I had to eat just 1 while it was hot and it literally MELTED in my mouth.   Bobby Q's, you have a fan in me!! I loved every single aspect of my experience and anytime I'm back in Phoenix I WILL BE BACK!!",

We ordered a combo that we were able to share -- top sirloin, ribs, baked potato, onion strings, mixed vegetables, and mac & cheese. Everything was grilled to perfection -- the sirloin was flavorful and tender, and the ribs were falling off the bone with amazing flavor as well. The mac & cheese was the best I've tasted anywhere, and the corn bread was moist with the perfect amount of sweetness.  All in all, it was a great experience. The ambiance is also very welcoming, with an artistic flair. We will most definitely be back if we visit the Phoenix area in the future!",

However, by the time we left there was a line of customers waiting to be seated.   From beginning to end, the service was great.. our drinks were always kept filled, we were checked on routinely, and our orders were ready in a timely manner..  Omg the food is soooo good. We opted for their feast type meal... we got baby back ribs, chicken, and brisket with Mac&cheese, coleslaw, and corn.. we also got broccolini and of course their cornbread....   The cornbread was a bit crumbly, but otherwise super warm and moist.. so delicious with butter and a little bit of honey. The sides were all flavorful and still simple, which I love.. the brisket was juicy and so tender you can cut it easily with a fork.. the baby back ribs fell off the bone.. and the chicken was delicious but definitely not the star..   For dessert, we shared a mud pie which would satisfy any chocolate/cookie lover.. and to top things off, our bill came with a small bag of fresh made mini donuts.. mind blown.   My family and I really enjoyed our experience here and wish I didn't live so far!",

More than likely you will have to wait for a table that is unless you show up at opening. Reservations available through Yelp, but if your party is larger than 6, a phone call is in order. There were 7 in our party. 6:30pm reservations on a Sunday and we showed up to a full house. Tried walking in on Saturday eve but the wait time was 2 hours for 5 people.   The bbq is delicious. I went with the Whole Hog Heaven, $56 and split with my wife. 2 styles of ribs with some brisket. I had lots of leftovers. No way I was leaving that bbq behind. I brought it back to Cali with me. Everything was good. My friends enjoyed their meals and thanked me for pointing them in right direction. If it weren't for me they would have eaten that so called bbq up the road at one of those roadhouse joints.   This is not a sports bar type atmosphere. There are a couple of small TVs by the bar. Great cocktails available as well. Make sure to get some of their fresh mini donuts on the way out.   Also, kid friendly for those traveling with kiddos. Parking lot is huge, which means full lot equals full house.",

I made a reservation through yelp, but it was honestly not really necessary as it wasn't that busy being a Monday afternoon and all.   We were promptly seated by the manager and our server came by soon after. The table was a bit wobbly and our server went off to find something to stuff underneath one of the legs to make it more stable. It was still wobbly but A for effort I guess haha.  The brisket is hands down the best I've ever eaten. I've never had a brisket so moist and juicy in my life. If I could turn back time I would have just exclusively ordered a whole tray of it. The BBQ slathered ribs were good, but I'm not a fan of sweet foods. The saving grace is that all the meats were perfectly cooked with the meat sliding right off the bone.  If I ever pass through Phoenix again I'll for sure be coming back here.",

    "text": "There's a damn good reason this place is close to 5 stars with over 3,000 reviews.   Complimentary cornbread and donuts, impeccable service, moist and tender meats, mouthwatering sides....what other reasons do you need to try this place?  Came here during lunch on a Monday with about 1/3 of the restaurant full.   Erica, our server, was so wonderful and a great addition to the already hospitable weekend we were having.   Checked out the lunch menu and they definitely offered great value meals. Boyfriend and I were looking at the 1/3 rack of ribs, but decided to split the whole rack of ribs with 2 sides, mac & cheese and shoestring fries. Erica recommended the mac & cheese and we couldn't have been any happier. With fives cheeses, it was so cheesy and creamy.   Ribs were moist and fall-off-the-bone tender. They offered 3 types of made in house bbq sauce: regular, spicy and a vinegar based sauce. I liked mixing the spicy with the vinegar based. The added pepper to their shoestring fries made them great on their own. But since I love condiments, I dipped my fries in ranch and the bbq sauces because why not.   I wish I was hungrier so I could have ordered off the dessert menu. But then all of a sudden a bag of complimentary cinnamon sugar donuts appeared on our table courtesy of Erica and all of a sudden, I had room for donuts. They were made fresh when we got them and they were crunchy and sweet and so satisfying for the end of the meal. I took the rest to go and had them throughout the day.   I was out here for a Muay Thai competition and if we're planning do this tournament again, Bobby Q is a definite MUST for post fights.",

We did not get any alcohol drinks, but I tried their strawberry lemonade and it was great. For our meal, we had to go with the whole hog heaven. Being from out of town, this was a no brainer, as this combo had the best of everything. We were able to try baby back ribs, st louis ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. All of these meats were delicious. My favorite were the st louis ribs and the pulled pork, but everything was so good.  Not only that, but this combo meal came with 3 sides. We went with the pecan cole slaw, mac & cheese, and mashed potatoes.  Again, very delicious sides. This platter was so large in size, that we had plenty of left overs to take home (to finish up later that night plus the next day). The portion size was excellent compared to the price.  The waiter we had was great. Made our experience even better. It was a nice bonus we got some fresh made mini donuts to go in a bag on our way out. And I got a free refill lemonade drink to go as well. This was probably the best BBQ I have had at a restaurant.  I can see why it is rated so high. A+ recommendation from me. Everything from food to service was outstanding. Everyone must try this BBQ.",

    "text": "First of all, I was with a large group who all appeared to enjoy their meals.  SO this is solely based on my palate.  I was starving after drinking my glass of wine at the bar.  I ordered the Grilled Top Sirloin with a 1/2 Rack of Baby Back Ribs.  Sides were baked potato (they forgot my sour cream and were so busy I didn't have the heart to ask for it..so that's on me), pecan coleslaw and potato strings (what was I thinking with already having the baked potato?)    Anyway, things arrived and the plate so full I didn't know where to start so move things aside and attempted to cut my steak.  It was cold.  It was also SO tough it took a number of tries for me to cut it.  My husband offered to cut it but I was determined!  The one bite I finally got off was tough and chewy.  The smoke flavoring overpowered it.  So I was done with the steak.  I then tried the ribs.  The meat fell off the bone and was extremely tender.  I did find them tasty but could only eat a couple due to the salt content.  Too salty for me.  I'm not sure if it was the sauce or if they use a rub, but it was overwhelming.  The pecan cole slaw was ok...I expected better.  It needs pineapple  :)    I didn't eat the fries as they were cold by the time I got to them.  Thankfully there was plenty of cornbread on the table which was amazing.  I wish I would have ordered some to take home.   Would I go back?  Yes, but to try some other items like maybe Bob's Salad.  Sounds really good.  I don't think I could eat the meat again because of the salt and overly smokey flavor.   The donuts at the end were evil...so maybe I'd go back for cornbread and donuts with a side salad. lol  My BIG complaint is our servers when bringing the receipts were really flustered.  I had two servers arguing behind me about things being wrong.  That is unprofessional and unnecessary around your customers.  I held my tongue but it was difficult.  If you have problems with your receipts...take it away from  your customers to sort it out.  I have no problem reiterating what I had and you can ring up a new receipt to get it clear and most people at our table would have felt the same way.  Again, DO NOT ARGUE in hearing distance of your customers.  It can ruin a nice evening for us.  Anyway, many of the friends with us loved their meal and I know Bobby Q's is a favorite for some.  Unfortunately I am not one of them.",

I don't feel wanted as a customer because of my food allergies.    I have gluten sensitivity and BBQ restaurants tend to be safer than most.  I'm a big fan of ribs.  Give me ribs, mashed potatoes & ice tea - and I'm content.  No special modifications required.    Their gluten free menu looked like a child had done it.  It was very negative and I don't think it was accurate.  The waitress asked us if we wanted cornbread moments after she had brought us the gluten free menus, and brought us doughnuts at the end of our meal.  I've been there in the past and received excellent service, to the point where I was thinking of scheduling a banquet there.  The last two times, the service has been so meh,  I'd rather take my money elsewhere.",

The caterers were really professional. My only issue was that we were not allowed to change our numbers after the wedding was 2 weeks out (We tried). -- Most caterers allow you to change up to 48 hours before the event. This would've saved us a TON of money as we had several people cancel on us at the last minute. We had more food left over than we knew what to do with, and it was a lot of money wasted.",

    "text": "Full disclosure: I'm a vegetarian.  What's that you say?  A vegetarian?!  What the heck is a vegetarian doing reviewing a BBQ place?  Settle down folks, I come in peace!  I have found myself at Bobby Q's a couple times now for my husband's work holiday party.  As I'm sure you could guess, this is likely the last place I would consider going, as I don't eat meat and I certainly wouldn't expect a bbq place to cater to my diet. :)  But I have to say it is probably one of the most vegetarian-friendly, meat-centric restaurants I have ever been to - is that a thing?  (Sorry Bobby Q's if I'm ruining your rep)  If you are a vegetarian and somehow find yourself here, you can definitely survive - in fact, you can actually really enjoy your meal. There are a few salads on the menu and also a bunch of great side dishes that you can assemble (tapas-style) to create a tasty vegetarian meal - my favorite combo is their baked potato (sans bacon), roasted veggies (super tasty) and the mac and cheese (seriously good).  In addition to the salads and sides there are several starters on the menu that will work as well as some a-la-carte items.    The staff there are great and they are super accommodating - no eye rolling when you say, \"I'm vegetarian, can I order a bunch of sides?\" just a friendly, \"Sure, what would you like?\"    And for all you meat eaters, check out the rest of the reviews - Bobby Q's clearly knows what they are doing.  Both times I've been there they are packed and its clearly a popular place.",

Brisket was like baby food consistency and tasteless without the sauce. NO smokes ring and no smokey flavor. Weird for a place that says that they smoke their meats on premises with mesquite wood. The grilled vegetables were basically raw with no seasoning. Mash potatoes were good. Ranch beans were good. My wife liked the cornbread. But overall was just okay food wise when considering the main attraction is the BBQ itself. Again service was awesome and she was tipped well for that and not the food. Ambiance is good but I tend to rate places on food and overall experience and the meat brought it down. Much better BBQ places around but perhaps just none in this area.",

There was 7 of us and we got sat fast. I had the BBQ chicken and mash and I ate it all and I never finish my food. My husband had the Sampler plate and he loved it. The corn bread is good. After your meal they bring a bag a freshly fried donuts and sugar. This place is soooooooooooooooooo good. When we come back to Phoenix we will go there again. Best BBQ we have tasted by far.",

The steak was probably the most delicious flavor I've ever had. Their grill has some amazing flavor on it. This piece of meat was cooked to perfection, and didn't need a thing.   I had 2 glasses of Mondavi Cabernet, and with everything it was under $50.   They ask you if you want dessert, and if you say no they give you a little bag of little sugary doughnuts.",

Perfectly cooked.  The place was just starting to get busy, but it in no way took away from the great service I had.  The place has a fully stocked bar, so I had to have a spicy Bloody Mary.    I started with the Cajun Shrimp appetizer and the flavor was spot on.  The shrimp were juicy and delicious and it comes with like garlic bread sticks to sop up the wonderful juices in the bowl.    To top the night off, I was presented with a Brownie Sundae with candle for my birthday!  (Totally unexpected and delicious)    Only regret was not going back and getting some BBQ to take home with me.",

    "text": "It had been a while since the last time we had barbecue, so we decided to make an 8 PM Saturday night reservation at Bobby Q. We were very pleased with all the meats we sampled and the Yelp rating didn't let us down.  We had about a fifteen minute wait after we checked in at the host stand just after 8. The waiting areas were crowded and many people were waiting outside. I think a buzzer/text system would save some young ladies' voices and annoyance of the guests because when a table became available, the hostesses would yell out the name of the party at the top of their lungs while walking through waiting area.  We were served by Hunter and he did an excellent job of handling being triple sat with a total of 12 guests by treating the multiple tables as he should and serving all of us as one party of 12. He gave us a brief background of the restaurant also informing us that all the meat is smoked for over 20 hours using mesquite wood. The recommendations for food and beverage were solid. During the meal, my daughter did drop her fork on the ground and we requested on three different occasions for a new one and it was never brought to us.  For drink, I started with the Bobby Q's amber ale by Thunder Canyon Brewery which the caramel and malty flavor was an excellent pairing with the barbecue. Along with the warm cornbread to start, we were recommended the Q-Rolls ($10.50) which were a great preview of the meats to come ahead. The brisket was tender and moist wrapped in a crispy shell with a little kick added with a chipotle dip.  For entrees, my wife and I split the Whole Hog Heaven ($48) which was way too much food for two. All four of us could have split this meal. They were out of sausage that night so we went with the pork to go along with the baby back ribs, St. Louis ribs, and brisket. All of the meat was smoky, tender, and juicy. No tough, dry meat here. The sauce was pretty standard and served in a small pot which eliminated the sticky, messy bottles. My daughter and her friend split the Southern Fried Chicken ($14). I didn't get to taste any of the chicken, but they finished everything, which usually isn't the case.  We passed on dessert as everyone was stuffed, but the bag of doughnuts was a nice parting gift which I finished pretty much the whole bag later as a late night snack.",

My drink never went under half, it was always refilled! Corn bread was super fresh and Mac and cheese was amazing. The bartenders customer service is top notch, they are definitely a model of amazing service.   The ONLY reason my review is getting only 4 stars is because my steak was WAY over cooked. I asked for Med Rare and it came out with a slight pink center. However it was still really juicy!",

    "text": "We picked Bobby Q's based on other Yelp reviewers. We were in town for the Mom Made Market in Scottsdale and wanted to take my husband out for some BBQ for his bday. We had reservations for 7:30 but came earlier and they sat us right away. Can't remember our waitress's name but she was so sweet and attentive. You get free cornbread with your order and they kept refilling it for us...my kids loved it! We got the spinach artichoke queso to start and it was amazing!!! Slightly spicy but not overly. Too spicy for my 7 year old but he's a wimp. My 8 year old loved it. My husband got the brisket sandwich with potato salad as his side. He says what makes a good BBQ place is how good their beef brisket is and their potato salad. (He's Texas born). He said both got 2 thumbs way up. They offer 2 sauces....spicy and original. The original was really sweet and the spicy not very but really good. I'd recommend that one. I got Bobby's salad and it had roasted chicken, goat cheese, apple, walnuts, cranberries, celery and came with a Dijon vingerette. It was so huge and so good. I hate when salads don't have very much \"stuff\" in them. Every bite was more than lettuce. It was so big and I couldn't finish it and even down to my last bite, plenty of chicken, cranberries and cheese. Both my kids got the kids BBQ sandwich with shoestring fries. I can't believe their meals were kids sized! Sandwiches had tons of chicken and sauce and a huge mound of fries. AND you get free warm cinnamon donuts at the end of your meal!!!!! If we are ever back in the Phoenix area, we'd definitely come again. Oh and the patio (where we ate) had lights stringed everywhere and a cool fountain. Great vibe out there. Perfect way to celebrate my babe's birthday.",

Looks a little more upscale on the inside than what I had expected...reminds me of something somewhere between Charleston's and the Keg. This is a pleasant surprise, especially considering the location.  The portions are huge, definitely big enough to share (which helps with the cost) and there are probably going to be leftovers depending on what you order. I have sampled most of the BBQ on the menu and it is all delicious. They bring a carafe of mild and regular sauces to the table so there is no shortage of sweet-tangy-saucy deliciousness. Good selection of side dishes. I especially liked their cole slaw -- not too wet, not too sweet.  The server brings a little bag of fresh mini donuts sprinkled with cinnamon sugar at the end of the meal. They are pretty incredible!!!",

Friendly staff Vanessa   Was our waitress and she was so nice and helpful. Struck up conversation and actually made us feel right at home!  They have a full bar and lounge for night life but we dined in I got the brisket platter (smoked for 18hrs ) and it was delicious!!!! So juicy and flavorful, came with 2 sides I got creamy mashed potatoes and shoe string fries both tasted hot n fresh not frozen or microwaved like most restaurants potato products. During our (short) wait after ordering we were served fresh made from scratch corn bread and got another basket without having to ask. A few rounds of beers/drinks and we were stuffed and completely happy.   UPDATE: We went back! Our last night and this was the only place we wanted to be at. Our server was  Sarah  And she was friendly fast and had refills out without asking I got the same order (plain and simple) and if possible it was BETTER than the first time!

Not the best sauce I've ever had but definitely had good flavor, the 'spicy' sauce wasn't very spicy.

    "text": "Been here with my gf right before new years. Ordered a Q roll and a bbq sampler platter. The Q roll has beef brisket wrapped inside and deep fried. It tastes a little crispy on the outside and the meat is really tender on the inside served with chipotle sauce and bbq sauce for $9. The bbq sampler comes with 3 meats for $13 so we chose bbq brisket, pulled pork, and the ribs. The ribs were REALLY tender and juicy, loved them. Brisket was very tender too and the pulled pork was good. Overall, the food was really good and service was pretty decent. I would recommend this place",

I'll be back for sure. Thanks Jo and Alena.",

I remembered it as the old Bobby McGee's and wondered what it was like now. I had seen reviews of BBQ places in Phoenix it was listed as being in the top 10. I starved myself at work yesterday and then stopped on the way home. This place gets packed after 6pm and I got there right before. I had the Q rolls based on another reviewers recommendation and also the people from the table next to me. I could not stop eating them...I was full by the time my 3 meat platter showed up. I took a taste of everything and it was wonderful. Pulled pork, chicken, and brisket. Today it will be lunch and dinner, and lunch was delicious reheated! I will drag my work friends here for lunch or dinner one of these days. Then I think I will try on of their steaks, aged in house. Maybe another review...",

We tried the whole hog heaven which was plenty for 4 people.  We got the St Louis ribs and baby back ribs - both delicious and saucy.  We also got the hot links and beef brisket.  I wasn't a fan of the hot links.  The beef brisket was slightly dry but with a bit of sauce it was quite delicious.    We also got corn and macaroni and cheese as sides.  I wouldn't recommend the corn - its very buttery and overcooked.  Mac and cheese was better, but mostly because its nice against the salty meats.  We also started with the Q-rolls(?) which was beef rolled in pastry material.  The sauce it comes with made it quite tasty as well.  All in all, if you're looking for a nice, sit-down bbq restaurant in Phoenix, this one's hard to beat!",

The brisket spring rolls are a delight to the taste buds and the ribs are fall off the bone delicious.  The meat was not greasy at all and had just the perfect amount of seasoning as well as a small amount of sauce. Yep... True BBQ is about the meat not the sauce.  The cornbread has just the right amount of sweet, though my southern hubby was disappointed it was not hot water cornbread.  This is most definitely not your chain BBQ restaurants that just hint at True quality product. Absolutely 5 stars!",

To my surprise it was some of the best bbq I've ever had.  Super tender ribs where the meat falls off and packed full of flavor.  Hands down some of the best bbq i've ever had.  My wife loved her steak.  We went to a high end steak house in Scottsdale and it easily beat it out with its flavor and tender cut.  I now recommend it as a must stop for great foot.  The service was phenomenal too.  I had mojito's which were so delicious and they didn't skimp on the alcohol.  Thanks Bobby Q for an awesome dinner experience.",

I was eager to try the beef ribs & again I told the young fellow easy BBQ sauce on them beef ribs because I wanted to taste the meat & the smoke flavor. To our surprise none of them were meant to our expectations. The beef ribs are fall of the bone but too much BBQ sauce on them ribs & I couldn't even taste the smoked meat. Ask any bbq enthusiast the taste are in the meat not the sauce. I rather stick with Dillons KC style beef ribs at Arrowhead location where you can taste the meat. This establishment is my first & last.",

The food remains top notch, best quality, but the SERVICE... wow... they've always gone out of their way but this time the service was incredible.  Our server was on top of it 110%, the management came to make sure we were happy, I mentioned one small concern in passing and it was as if the place stopped for us.  No one rested until it was addressed.  I can't tell you how much we appreciate being... appreciated!  People say \"you drive all the way to 27th Ave & Dunlap from north Scottsdale to eat?\"  I say HELL YEAH we'd drive twice as far for great BBQ because it's hard to get the real thing like this.  Besides it's a matter of perspective, Phoenix metro area is small compared to Chicago.  The greater Chicago metro area is HUGE, it spans at least 6 counties.  We drive 55 miles each way for real BBQ back in IL.  And we're lucky to have it that close.  Oh yeah - for the first time we had the \"whole hog\" and it was an experience.  It was 2 meals for us, and the leftovers were just as good the next day.",

As soon as our sodas or empty he was right there to brings us refills.

I ordered the special drink of the day, an adult Arnold Palmer.  One word:  AMAZING.  The lemonade they used really put it over the top.  So fresh and tart!  Everyone at our table was pleased with the abundance of meat and side items they received.  The icing on the cake was definitely the freshly fried mini cinnamon and sugar donuts they give you before you leave.  It's little touches like that that will beckon us to eat here again and again.",

    "text": "Made the trip up the 17 to visit Bobby Q last night. I love me some good bbq, and had heard good things about Bobby Q, so it was time to give it a try. It being a summer Tuesday night the parking lot was busy, but not packed and we were seated right away. The restaurant itself was doing a good business. I enjoyed the interior. It was one of the most, dare I say, upscale bbq places I've frequented, though it's not upscale at all.   Our server came by quickly and introduced herself. She asked if we had ever been there before and when we said no she got excited and told us all about the place. We each ordered a beer and decided what to order. We settled on the Whole Hog Heaven Feast to get a sample of a few things. Our Whole Hog included St. Louis & Baby Back Ribs along with brisket and sausage. For our sides we went with the ranch beans, corn, and mac n cheese. We weren't able to polish off the whole thing, but we came close.   I must say that these were some of the best ribs I've had in a long time! They were perfectly cooked, easy to remove from the bone, but not fall off the bone, and amazingly the pork stayed together. I slightly preferred the baby backs. I wasn't as big of a fan of the brisket, but then again I am generally not a fan of brisket. To me, the best bbq is pork. The sausage was good, but I wouldn't go and order it as my dish. We got some of their spicy bbq sauce on the side and thought it had a good flavor. You could feel the heat, but it wasn't hot or overpowering and didn't linger.   Of the sides we agreed the mac n cheese was the winner, though the beans were flavorful as well. The mac n cheese is certainly cheesy! Corn is corn.   I know I really liked this place because as I was eating I swung my legs like a little kid who can't touch the ground with their feet. Signs of a happy camper.   We are gluttons for punishment so we got some apple cobbler for dessert. It was good, but not memorable. Overall, the service here was wonderful and everyone made sure we were taken care of. We will definitely be back!",

My wife love them, I thought they were pretty good.  We ordered the Whole Hog Heaven and it was awesome, meat was unbelievably tender and tasty. The sides were second to none as well, especially the fries. I have eaten too many fries in my life, and these were probably the best I have had. The service was excellent and we had a visit from a manager to make sure everything was to our liking. Atmosphere was very nice, our food came quite quickly. Took our leftovers and had more than enough for lunch the next day. They give you some mini donuts for the road, but u will be so full you will probably hold off for a bit. Honestly the only drawback is the location, it is in an older area, but it did not feel unsafe. If we return to PHX we will return to enjoy Bobby Q's again !",

They even had sweet iced tea which for me is a must for any respectable BBQ restaurant, the sweet tea was also great.  The brisket was cooked perfectly and the flavor was amazing, you could tell it was cooked properly over the hickory wood.  I've had Texas style brisket at about a dozen popular places in Houston and only one small place called Gatlin's comes close to the brisket at Bobby-Q.  The bbq sauce also had a good flavor, the mac was very cheesy and the fries were perfect for dipping in the original bbq sauce.  What else can I say about this place?...it was great.  I almost went here two nights in a row during my trip to Phoenix, went to Pizza Bianco on the second night and was not impressed.  I wish I would have gone to Bobby-Q the second night, I would have tried the sliced BBQ pork.",

Chicken was just a little dry in some areas. Servers and cashiers coordinated very well for a party of ~20 people.  All food was delivered at approximately the same time.  Checks were split without problems. Fresh, complimentary cinnamon doughnuts were super tasty.",

Cornbread and awesome BBQ, brisket/ribs and mac n cheese that will blow you away.  Oh yeah, the \"thank you donuts\" - incredible.  Might as well order a dozen of those babys take my word for it! I found my sizzle here. Ask for Tiffany, she is awesome!!  See ya there.  UPDATE: I ordered the hamburger there and FORGET ABOUT IT - THIS IS THE BEST BURGER IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA.  The staff here, in my opinion (aside from Hillstone which is equally as good) is the best you can find anywhere.  Other restaurants should figure out how they hire people and pay them to figure it out.  I have been to hundreds and hundreds of restaurants across the United States, you won't find better.",

My experience with the service was more of a mixed bag. I was waiting 10 mins before the waiter came. It was a minor thing but the manager put the appetizer on the house. Also I had ordered my steak medium-rare but the steak was closer to medium-well (the difference is the blood, medium-rare is a little bloody, medium is not). I mentioned it to the waiter and the manager put the steak on the house. Honestly, the steak was so good I did't care.  I would go again. 5 stars for the food, 4 stars for the service, and an extra star for effort.",

It wasn't for lack of trying though! The hits start with the corn bread and roll on from there! The sides were just ok, I'd love to see fried okra, but let's face you come here for the meat!! We had baby back ribs, beef ribs, brisket and pork. The baby backs were TO DIE FOR! Falling off the bone with just enough yummy crunchy bark. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite! I highly recommend you take home a jug of sauce to impress your friends at your next back yard gig. Did I mention the tiny hot fresh donuts they bring with the check?! Yumm!

I lean more toward the veggies when it comes to food preferences, and you'll certainly never see me eating ribs.  That being said, I LOVED Bobby Q's! I had a cheeseburger (yes, I do eat burgers), and it was downright delicious. Mac and cheese was amazing as well. My friend had the ribs and couldn't get over them.  Highly recommended!",

That being said I like the look and feel of the place as well.  Service has always been awesome and last time was no exception.  Our server, Jo, was friendly, attentive and provided great customer service.  I'm usually here for lunch and while the place is busy it has never been too crowded or loud, making it ideal for a business lunch. It's also easy to access from the I-17 and has plenty of parking.  What can I say, I'll definitely be back.",

I called in 45 minutes before and booked a reservation for Sunday night. Upon arrival, they greeted us warmly and seated us right away at a comfortable booth. Hunter, our server, was awesome. He was super friendly and helped us make our dinner choices.   My boyfriend and I shared the Wedge Salad and the 3 Meat Combo - St. Louis Ribs, Baby Back Ribs, and the Brisket. The Wedge Salad was really fresh and refreshing (but not the healthiest since it comes with a pile of fried onions, but I'm not complaining!) All the meats were fall-off-the-bone tender and the bbq sauce was on point. For the sides we had the Baked Beans which were perfectly sweet, and the Mac n Cheese which I could probably have done without but it was okay.   I couldn't have been happier with the meal and service but then they come with a bag of HOT FRESH donuts on the house. Wow...talk about cherry on top. You guys definitely made my night! 5 stars all the way!",

They gave me complimentary cornbread as a starter. I'm not the biggest fan of cornbread, but this cornbread wasn't that bad, especially when you add butter into the mix. I haven't had much from the menu, but the smokehouse burger is one of my favorite burgers and my favorite thing to order. Very flavorful and greasy. Just how I like it. I believe it has bacon, BBQ sauce, fried onions, cheddar cheese, and some really good secret sauce on it. It came with a side of fries by choice. The fries are so good. Very thin but pretty flavorful. I went on my birthday and was surprised with a complimentary ice cream cake with a candle in it. Suddenly my stomach expanded. It was very good. On top of that, they gave me a complimentary bag of sugary donut holes. They were warm and very soft. Just when I thought they had already stole my heart, they stole it again. Thank you Bobby Q. You made this boy's birthday dinner a good one.",

The people at the table next to us on the patio were like...um, what did you two order?? We had no answers for them other than...awesomeness apparently! I've had some small martinis for $10 before...so this was just...whoa.  I had the pulled pork and mac and cheese. I will admit that the pulled pork was a bit dry, but a little extra BBQ sauce and that's an easy fix. Plus the BBQ sauce was delicious, so it gave me an excuse to use more! Win.   The mac and cheese was, for lack of a better word, luscious. Creamy, cheesy and everything good southern style comfort food mac and cheese should be.  The real winner here for me was hands down the cornbread though. I'm a huge cornbread fanatic, and theirs was True southern to the core. Well done Bobbby Q, well done.  Overall: A+ Some good southern BBQ with great sauce and great sides. And...the drinks..I mean seriously...the drinks!",

Double down on some baby back ribs, enjoy some mac n'cheese, and save room for some complimentary fresh fried doughnuts for dessert (Or like me force them down with a BBQ covered grin.) Lot's of people rave about the Q-Rolls, however that was probably the only moot point for me. I'd recommend you save room for the meats.

I'm from California and we are blessed with Phil's BBQ and my sister and I prefer Bobby Q over Phil's BBQ!  What We Ordered - Beef Brisket with Mac and Cheese and Mashed Potatoes - 2 Meat Combo: Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket with Mac and Cheese and Mashed Potatoes - Steak Sandwich with Shoestring Fries - Catfish Po Boy Sandwich with Roasted Corn  The complimentary corn bread was good! Very moist! The beef brisket was good! The meat was tender but I felt that I needed to add the bbq sauce for it to taste better. The Mac and Cheese was super duper cheesy!! I loved it!! The Mashed Potatoes were really good as well! Super buttery and smooth.  The Pulled Pork (not pictured because my sister was sitting too far) was AMAZING. It was good by itself or with the bbq sauce! I really wished I ordered this instead, like I originally planned. Luckily, my sister let me sample some of hers. :) My Mom enjoyed her catfish po boy. She's really picky so that's telling you something lol. My Sister and Mom loved the roasted corn!   The only bad dish was the Steak Sandwich but I don't know if that's because my Dad ordered it medium well. He said it was too chewy and had no flavor. His shoestring fries were really, really salty and soggy! He was very upset, to say the least lol.  They give you little sugar donuts, (Thank Q's), at the end of the meal! They were so cuteeee! They were just average tasting but I enjoyed the fact that they were free! I will come back for the Pulled Pork!",

The atmosphere is nice and comfortable with plenty of room between tables. There is even a small patio for cooler nights.  The food was good. I really enjoyed the Q-Roll stuffed with brisket and served with their chipotle sauce. I sensed that the portions would be large, so my partner and I shared the 2 rib entry (St Louis & Baby-back). The rancho beans had their own distinctive flavor without the beans being over-cooked. The same could be said of the steamed veggies. Corn bread is served with every meal and presented in a nice round Pattie; and it taste liked corn BREAD as opposed to cake.  My 4 star rating came because I felt that ribs were a little too salty.  The next time I come in I will still opt for ribs, maybe a steak. I may enjoy a cocktail with Q-Rolls as well.",

    "text": "Not sure what's the matter with the reviewers of Phoenix when it comes to BBQ, but this place does not deserve a top 100 spot on Yelp's annual list. It's not bad, but I've had MUCH better.  The vibe is cool, but the food isn't amazing. The meat is well cooked, but  lacks flavor, which is fortunately enhanced by the barbecue sauce--the highlight of the meal.  The brisket platter ($25) comes with 12oz of meat, 2 sides, and cornbread. Though I'm skeptical about the 12 ounces. Also, by the pound, the brisket is $20--maybe a better option.  I'm not sure why more restaurants don't put more effort into their side dishes. They're much easier to get right. Though it still seems like good meat can be a dime a dozen, when good sides are harder to come by. Doesn't make sense.  The side dishes at Bobby Q were not good. Their mac & cheese feels like a premium version of Kraft. Extremely cheesy. Their beans were unlike anything I've tasted before. They almost had a weird celery-like flavor, which must have been from the type of beans they used. They weren't terrible, but I couldn't finish them. Then, there's the cornbread. It actually looked promising with its crumbly, pancake-look. But it was dry and flavorless.   As I said, the sauce was the highlight. It was a Memphis-style sweet and smokey sauce which tasted very good by itself, but not too big of a flavor to distract from the meat--instead, bringing out the little flavor that the meat had, enhancing the meal as a whole.  The meat wasn't terrible. It was still tender and juicy. Just not a lot to taste by itself.  I honestly can't see myself coming back here when I return to the Phoenix area. There are many more restaurants to try and I wasn't impressed enough. Though I might go back and buy a bottle of that sauce.",

I was expecting them to be a little sweeter. My husband had a pulled pork sandwich with potato salad. I took a bite of his potato salad, it was really good. My 12 year old didn't want to order off the kids menu, so he ordered the 1/2 rotisserie chicken with Mac and cheese and fries. He surprisingly ate everything but the fries ( dad ate those). The portions are good sized, but a bit pricey ($25 for Brisket plate, $21 for 1/2 chicken plate). I would eat here again. The corn bread before the meal and the cinnamon sugar donuts after were a nice touch. The server was nice. Wish he had kept up on the drinks.",

It's just not the best BBQ I've had, and for the prices ($40 for a 3-meat combo, drink, tax, tip, etc.) it's on the higher range of the BBQ places that I go to.  Maybe I just prefer the down and dirty places?  I don't know....but the corporate chain feeling stuck out a little more than I was expecting.  That being said, there was nothing at all wrong with the food.  The brisket was really moist so I'll probably give that another try.  The ribs had good meat on them.  One downside is they put BBQ sauce on the sausage.  I like the natural flavor a bit better.  The cornbread was average, the mac and cheese was very good.  Maybe I should say better things about a 4-star rating but that's just how it feels to me.  A lot of people like this place and anything I didn't like came down more to personal taste rather than the restaurant doing anything wrong.  So....give it a shot and make your own opinion.",

    "text": "Coming from Virginia, I have some pretty strong opinions on what good barbecue is. For the most part, I've avoided barbecue since moving to Arizona, but my friends wanted to try out Bobby Qs, so trying out Bobby Qs we did.  We sat on the outdoor patio which was warmly lit and welcoming. Our server was incredibly friendly, which only added to the good vibes. Although not barbecue, the southern fried chicken caught my eye. I got it with creamy mashed potatoes and a delightful (maybe yogurty?) mac and cheese on the side. The cornbread that came with it was also heavenly. Though they are round and slightly more difficult to handle than the regular square ones, they were delicious and moist and there was more than enough butter that came with them.  My s/o got the pulled pork platter with roasted corn and shoestring fries. We traded our mashed potatoes and roasted corn because I absolutely ADORED the roasted corn. Perfectly buttery with such a good roasted flavor. Just thinking about it makes me hungry.  The only gripe I had was that for its price, there really wasn't that much food. It was enough for me to have leftovers, but it can't compare to my favorite bbq joint back home where $11 got you a pound of pulled pork.",

First off, we paid for a table and they made us wait until 10:45pm to even get our table when they told us to be there by 10PM, then one of their waitresses charged us for a water (which was NOT a water bottle) which are free from as far as i know and we gave her a 20 dollar bill and she never came back to give us the change. Then the security gaurd kicked us out for being \"too intoxicated\" we hadn't even had a drink yet! We were 100% sober because we hadn't even gotten to our table yet!!! He just randomly picked us out of the crowd and told us to leave saying my eyes were closed and it looked like i was falling asleep! How can i fall asleep while dancing? and how can i make eye contact with you if i'm sleeping? I couldn't believe it!! I asked to speak to the manager and then the security gaurd tried to say he was the manager when he clearly was an 18 year old kid trying to talk down to me. I will never go back to that club again. It was by far the worst experience i've ever had at a night life club and i do NOT reccommend ANYONE to go there! People don't waste your money here!",

First the hostess could not answer any of our questions about happy hour.. we asked if it was just in the bar area.. had no clue, sat us in the main dining room and then told our waitress.. Apparently it was one of those restaurants were happy hour is in the bar only (which I really don't understand).. anyway our waitress said she'd give us happy hour prices, but didn't understand that we also wanted to order dinner, (people don't eat dinner in the bar?).. Maybe it was new-training staff day or something..   We were given cornbread to start which was good, but just crumbled in your hand.. then my friend got the Poboy Catfish sandwich, not impressed, said it was so freaking dry the fish and everything.. I had better luck with my pulled-pork sandwich.. However, it was a huge mess to eat, which I understand that just how it is, but I had no silverware to try and help.. I got fries on the side and I love fries, eat them all the time.. but these were covered with grease, not just your normal greasy fries but had enough they created a puddle, just too much for me.  Overall the food was okay (say no to the catfish).. I would go back for another pork sandwich but with a side of potato salad instead",

Lesson #1: good BBQ has some smoke to the meat (this place has NO smoky flavor to their meat) Lesson #2: there was no smoke ring that denote it spent any time cooking low and slow like they advertise.  Lesson #3: the meat fell of the bone (Great BBQ is removed from the bone, not fall off the bone. Kansas City BBQ Society rules) I suspect that the baby back ribs I was served were first boiled, then placed on the grill right before it was slathered with raunchy sauce.

Nothing like stepping into the bar area watch one of your favorite games in the screens while you have a conversation with the bartender there, eat the wings and drink a freezing cold beer. I also had the chance to take my mom there for her birthday and she loved it, not a long time after we got there we were able to sit in the main restaurant area and we had a full meal, the managers will always check on you and make sure the food is fabulous. Another personal recommendation is the Grilled Salmon, is just perfect, tender and juicy. Great servers there too, you will have a great time and they always make sure you have everything you need to make your food awesome, last time we had Rishad as our server and he made sure everything was on point.

This place is excellent. Sketchy area in PHX but excellent food. the Q Rolls were awesome and the BBQ sauce was a great topper, The Whole Hog Heaven platter is huge and plenty for 3 hearty eaters. The ribs (beef, St. Louis and Baby Back) were excellent, brisket tender and the chicken perfect! I don't mean to gush, but seriously... it was that good. So thats the food, now lets talk service.. Holy Guacamole... Whoever runs this joint, needs to become the main go to person for an entire industry! The service was freakin' awesome. Our waitress, Bailey, was absolutely phenomenal. She couldn't have been better and the place was packed! 2 managers came over to our table to check on us! not 1 but 2!! this place is BY FAR well worth the trip and the cost (which wasn't bad at all).

Now, it's opposite of quality and just a brand name for the cesspool Phoenix has become as well. The macaroni is dry, the meat is nasty, the soda was disgusting.

Shared the Whole Hog with Nephew and Son had the Smokehouse Burger. Lunch menu on weekdays is cheaper but still reasonable if looking for a great weekend meal.  The Whole Hog if a lot of food. Choice of two half slabs of pork ribs, two additional meats and three sides. Corn muffins and doughnuts served with the meal. More than enough for a shared meal. Put this one on your list. Yelp check in earns 10 percent off your bill.",

However, with that said the manager stopped by the table to say hi and the staff were very nice. Their patio is very pretty.   I am embarrassed to admit I have never been here before since it changed over. The food was fine but it seems very expensive.

    "text": "A couple of facts about me:   I'm a native of AZ. I've only been to the Grand Canyon a few times. This was my first visit to Bobby Q.  I can't believe it took me so long. I have sampled their BBQ at events, but this is my first visit to their establishment. So being a native, I grew up going to Bobby McGee's (one of owner Bob Sikora's original endeavors here in the Valley). In 2005, he turned his attention to BBQ and opened up Bobby Q. You can smell the meat smoking as you get out of your car in the parking lot. The menu has a variety of meats to choose from like tender brisket, pulled pork, chicken, prime rib, steaks, fish and burgers. The brisket and pork is slow cooked for hours at a low temperature. They smoke their meat with Almond and Mesquite wood and use a nice blend of spices for the dry rub. For BBQ sauce, Bobby Q has both a sweet and spicy Carolina sauce available. They have a variety of sides to choose from for your entree but I highly recommend their cheesy mac & cheese. It's so gooey and delicious! My sliced-brisket sandwich was amazing and I savored each bite. If you aren't a meat lover (why would you come here if not?), the Biltmore location has a some vegan dishes and other healthy options on the menu. Bobby Q is known for their famous corn bread that is complimentary if you order something. They are really good (especially with butter on it) and are made fresh daily. Each table also gets a complimentary bag of fresh-made mini doughnuts dipped in cinnamon sugar for the ride home (mine didn't make it to the car). Overall, prices are very reasonable and portions are large. This was a fun experience and I look forward to future visits. The restaurant can be a little loud at times but it does have a fun community feel to it. In addition to the Biltmore location, Bobby Q also has a location in Mesa.",

You have a choice of 2 sides mine were a baked potato and beans. Husband choose Mac n cheese and beans. The beans are very flavorful with barbecue meat pieces cooked with them. Baked potato was cooked correctly with your choice of toppings. Husband loved the Mac n cheese.  Our server was awesome sorry I forgot his name but he was funny checked up on us periodically and left us to go boxes once he saw we were slowing down.  Dessert time keep in mind they bring a paper bag filled with small sugar cake donuts with your check. These hot tasty donuts are the best send off and are on the house!",

Found this place on a whim, I was stuck in the area and starving and saw the great reviews here so decided to give it a try. The place wasn't too busy on a Thursday night but I stood at the front podium for what felt like 3-4 minutes with waiters, hosts, bartenders buzzing around me doing things, chatting with each other and not even noticing I was standing there waiting. They finally sat me but then I waited another 9 minutes (this time I kept my eye on my watch) to get greeted and brought a menu. I was dining on my own as I travel for work and have noticed that when you are a table of one, you get kind of forgotten about.   I ordered the Q rolls, which, oh my god, GET THE Q ROLLS!!!! So tender and juicy and the dipping sauces are great. I also got the ribeye which was delicious as well. The cornbread was one of the best cornbread I have ever had. I even got to take home two little complimentary donuts.   This place has ALL of the right ingredients to be a favorite but I just wish service was a bit more attentive. However, I would definitely visit back next time I am in Phoenix.",

    "text": "As far as the BBQ goes, it was very ordinary, but they had some proper platter deals and lunch specials. Plus complimentary corn bread to start off the meal! They also usually have complimentary mini doughnuts to end the meal, but unfortunately the fryer wasn't turned on before opening when we arrived and it wasn't hot enough by the time we were ready to leave... so the fact that I had declined the second helping of corn bread (which came with our platter) all so I could save room for the doughnuts was not well planned out.   In any case, again... the BBQ was rather run-of-the-mill and perhaps some items were overcooked, but they're all about their sauce here. We ordered the *Platter Sampler* since it was a great way to try out their wares. We selected brisket, baby back ribs, and St. Louis style ribs for our meat choices and a mac as our side. Our server asked if we wanted their Original or Spicy BBQ sauces and she obliged when we requested for both. They give you relatively large vats of this sauce, so you basically are smothering everything in it. Otherwise, the baby back ribs were probably the most impressive. Good tender meat with that overcooked, fall-off-the-bone quality. The sauce on the St. Louis ribs wasn't anything I was accustomed too; a bit astringent and not exactly vinegary. The brisket was pretty boring, dry, and over cooked. Again, the sauce helped greatly to enhance its quality.   We also sampled a bit of their lunch special for $9.95, the *BLC Sandwich* aka the bacon, lettuce, and CHICKEN. It was a very good deal and the one half we consumed was actually rather tasty; meaty and juicy chicken with a large helping of bacon, lettuce, and sauce.   Service was fantastic and the outdoor patio was relaxing and comfortable with the cushions, although said cushioning was kind of grody and caked with spilled food. There's a lot of BBQ in Phoenix and this one is very much well-loved by the locals. Again, not real BBQ in my opinion, but you go for the ambiance... and good deals!",

It was hot, moist, and perfectly sweet & savory.  Zucchini fries were perfectly fried and dusted with Parmesan cheese-- a delicious appetizer I would order again Artichoke dip was gone before I could try some, but everyone raved about how delicious it was Q rolls: smoked brisket in phyllo dough. Absolutely delicious!   Meat: beef ribs were perfectly cooked with tons of smoke flavor. Absolutely delicious! My favorite of all the meat we tried.  Baby back ribs: fall of the bone tender-- covered in the perfect amount of BBQ sauce. Would definitely recommend trying.  Brisket: super tender, some tender & some lean. Absolutely perfectly smoked.  Chicken: breast was slightly dry and under seasoned.   Broccolini: perfectly cooked & seasoned. My favorite of all the sides.  Mac & cheese: slightly too salty, but a generous portion.  Fries: I prefer my fries to be shoestring, but these were cut a little too thinly for my taste.   Service: super nice & attentive despite how busy they were.   If you are visiting the Phoenix area you must try this place. It was so delicious that I went back the next day!",

    "text": "Since there have been so many reviews of Bobby Q, I'll just quickly review our experience with food and service. See pictures too.  Hot wings: very juicy (good quality chicken). Wifey thought the sauce was a bit \"different\" (i.e., not True buffalo authentic), but she enjoyed them nonetheless. They were a bit spicy, but not so hot that you finish your beer in 5 seconds (more like 30 seconds, but I digress) The veggie were also good, if you're into that sort of thing..  Pull Pork Sandwich: the pork itself was excellent. Big chunks of meat (not shredded), which was very tender. They serve it with a little BBQ sauce (but you can supplement), a pickle on the side, and a side of your choice. The bun, however, was very buttered - too much for my taste, and slightly burnt. I would probably tell them to hold the bun next time (or the butter!)  Baby-back ribs: I really wanted to like these since they looked so good (and fall-off-the-bone tender). However, they were VERY smoky - perhaps it was just the sauce, but it was definitely a detraction for me. I routinely go to the south for BBQ (so my expectations may be high) but I would pass on these in the future. Wifey also thought they were very salty, but she tends to be more sensitive to that than me.  Shoe-string french fries: as good as they sound. Very tasty, super thin, and salty. Would definitely get these again.  Service: very attentive and friendly. In addition to our main server, we had 2 other staff check up on us (as part of their routine), but it was not intrusive at all.  Beer on tap: went with the Bobby Q brown ale and later a Kiltlifter. The Bobby Q was a bit too nutty - definitely going with the Kiltlifter next time!",

I ordered the ribeye steak and it was cooked exactly to order delivered with great sides. Great beer selection on tap and those donuts - warm, soft, sweet donuts.

A little awkward but overall was nice. He got our drink order and we ordered some appetizers. The fries were delicious the wings on the other hand were just ok.. We decided to share a 12oz WELL DONE  \"filet mignon\". It took about 45 minutes for our food to come out and the server kept apologizing for the wait and said  it was being \"cooked to perfection\". Which was ok since we ordered it WELL DONE. The steaks finally came out and they were nice enough to split the plates for us. I cut into my steak and it was not even close to well done.. Too too pink.. We were upset because it took so long we were hoping it would Atleast Come out properly.. My boyfriend cut into his and it was slightly pink.. So he gave me his steak but both steaks weren't the way we asked... We told out server and he didn't offer to take our steaks away until a manager came by and the manager said we were gonna get some new steaks... They brought out the \"new ones\" but it was clearly the same ones just put on the grill longer...  No flavor at all and very tough to bite into , if we're spending $20-25 on a steak we have some decent expectations.. My boyfriend and I didn't eat much of the steak the manager had to take a second look deciding if he should take the steaks off.. They gave us 9$ off..  Disappointed completely.   One star for the fries and the delicious corn bread..",

The Brisket is moist, not as smokey as it should be, but it's tender and full of flavor. The Mac N Cheese is excellent. The Corn also kicks A.  AZ is lucky to have a gem like this in their city. Most places around the country can't even get close to this.  Hats off to Bobby Q!",

Hostess was friendly, food served efficiently and the waitress was great.  The interior is quite spacious and nice.  The prices are reasonable for the generous portions.  We had a sampler and everything was good.  Not great, but really good.  Overall I left happy.  If you are in the area and in the mood for barbecue, I don't think you can go wrong at Bobby Q.",

From the sangria, frozen lemonade and cornbread to the baby back ribs, mac & cheese and coleslaw, it was all excellent.  Service was friendly, portions were generous and food was out very quickly.  The free take away bag of sugar donuts was a wonderful end for a delicious dinner.  Even at 5:30 on a Sunday night the restaurant was full and a reservation helped us to be seated promptly.",

Getting out of the heat without walking into an icebox made the meal very relaxing. My server Justin made sure to help me out with some amazing suggestions as well as made sure I never ran out of water or cornbread. I ended up getting a two meat combo of baby back ribs and some brisket. The brisket shredded easily and I couldn't pick up my ribs by the bone, absolutely delicious.",

    "text": "Everything is relative to the area.  So I will say that this is definitely the best in Phoenix or anywhere else in Arizona.  No chain or mom&pop shop can compare to Bobby Q's.  I ordered take out but their little after dinner doughnuts were a nice twist to bbq.  And the cornbread was certainly better than average.  My favorite part comes when we speak of the macaroni&cheese.  Who and how in the world did someone in Phoenix learn how to make mac n cheese like this ?!  I was skeptical when I looked at it because it was an off-white color.  But it was creamy and full of rich flavor.  I ordered the smoasted chicken and drizzled some of that bbq sauce on it.  It was well cooked and the bbq sauce was high quality with a little zip and long lasting good after taste.  Strongly recommed the sauce (on the smoasted chicken) and mac n cheese.   Your mouth will water when we talk about the peach cobbler.  It's not the best I've had (3 places I've tried around the world have been better) but it's a B+++++.  The crust is almost candied and melts in your mouth.  The flavor is NOT too sweet or powerful to the point where you can only eat a few bites.  It was well put together.  To top it off, the person who answered the phone and took my order (and my money) had her customer service skills in high gear.  She made me want to return because I felt like I was being taken care of.  Big smile, plenty of suggestions on whether I wanted her to include an extra cornbread or a couple extra doughnuts....at no charge.  Very accomodating so I had no problem living her a nice sized tip.  She made the experience enjoyable and I will be back time and time again!!!",

The first thing that struck me was that all the Super Heroes were gone....those were the days when you could come in an have Batman (or if your lucky,...WONDER WOMAN) serving your food.  But like all things, we have to grow up.  Ever since El Paso BBQ closed down on 43rd and Peoria, I have been looking for good BBQ. Well, lo and behold...at Bobby Q's, I FOUND IT!  Start off with the Q rolls (which is a beef brisket rolled in a tortilla and then deep fried) and go right into your 2 or three meat platter. OH YEAR! The brisket is great, the pork is pulled perfectly, and all the meats are tender, juicy and flavorful!  Kristi indulged in a traditional chicken fried chicken and I will be darned if it was not the best I have had in Arizona!   I had to force down the macaroni and cheese, which was also cheesy and flavorful, but I managed,  As we were leaving at 9:45 PM on a Saturday, the lines were already opening up for the party scene on the bar side....so it shows that even though its no longer the Bobby McGees I grew up with, it hasn't lost its lister for the night life!  Highly recommended!",

For a starter we had some Q-rolls, kind of a BBQ brisket taquito, with chipotle sauce.  Good start.  Beef ribs and pork ribs were tender and easily pulled off the bone.  Brisket and pulled pork were as tender as could be, with a nice pink smoke ring, evidence of slow smoking.  Excellent Mac and cheese and pecan cole slaw.  Beer is plentiful and cold, service quick and attentive, and (bonus) a check in discount for Yelpers when we visited.  This is now on my list for future visits to Phoenix.",

I know that they have a lot of other things on the menu, but I always  get BBQ. When you like it, don't change. Full service bar and lots of parking. Please do not drink and drive though.

    "text": "After reading and hearing about Bobby Q I figured I had to find out for myself.   When it comes to BBQ I find it, like others, hard to get quality BBQ. If I do venture into something new trying to find that diamond in the rough I have 3 staples to sample: Baby Back Ribs, Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket. I also judge beans and some carb.   I ordered the staples with beans and Mac & Cheese. I wasn't given an option for wet or dry BBQ. I had to ask as the bartender was walking away to make mine dry and put it on the side.   The meal started with a very moist and greasy corn bread basket. The greasy texture made me use a fork just to get it anywhere close to my mouth.   Moments later my dry BBQ arrived and the server started walking off when I had to ask for BBQ where I learned there were 3 options: regular, spicy or a third that I don't recall. Nice to know that NOW. Thanks bartender.   The ribs looked good but pulling apart showed they were not smoked at all. Just a HIGHLY salty rub and grill time. The pull apart can be achieved by many alternative means.   The pulled pork was sweet, quality pork, but the exact same texture as what I get out of my crockpot. There was no bark, no sign of a smoke ring, nothing to indicate this was BBQ.   The brisket is the only reason I gave this place 2 stars. They gave me 4 slices of what I would call Prime grade and perfectly smoked. The brisket showing a solid smoke ring and bark and it barely held together which is well beyond many other joints.   The Mac and Cheese are almost exactly like Kraft Blue Box, so not original at all. The beans however were al dente and smoky sweet. Again, nothing special.   To top off the epic failure in service, there was no wet nap offered or within sight. Really?? I just wanted outta there and to let others know, order a steak or prime rib to go.",

The one knock on it was that it was a tad too salty, but I'm not one to complain about a little salt. They were so good we impulsively ordering a SECOND rack of ribs, only to realize that we were too full to continue soon thereafter.  The Q-Rolls stuffed were amazing as well, especially with the chipotle dip. Imagine a buttery pastry wrapped around smoked brisket, and you get the Q-Roll. If you had to get one appetizer, get this.  The best part is that they give you free donut holes at the end of your meal!",

The Mac and cheese also has  quite a few different cheeses... Including velveeta? YES PLEASE. Personally, I think the cornbread is a little dry and the steak sandwich was just a huge disappointment. I really don't think that one slice of garlic bread and a hunk of steak makes a sandwich. And yes, it's ONE slice of garlic bread... I just don't see that as a sandwich. The mashed potatoes are great, make sure you get extra gray cause that's the best part. If you want something as an appetizer, happy hour is from 4-8 and their 50% off... The brisket quesadilla and spinach artichoke queso dip with garlic bread are the best ones on the menu if you ask me. Give this place a shot, it's got great reviews for a reason. Just don't get the steak sandwich. Hahahah",

We had the Q Rolls for an appetizer and they were different than anything we ever had but were good!  For dinner we ordered the Whole Hog Heaven plate which consisted (our choice) of beef ribs, spare ribs and double brisket and let me tell you, cooked to perfection, smoked to perfection and after 1-2 days left overs, still <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>!!!  However I did not care for the beans or mashed potatoes.  Not very tasty but the Mac n cheese was good and very creamy!  I highly recommend this place.  I live in So Cal and would make a special trip out to Az for this place!",

When an appetizer alone is so delicious that I would (and have) drive the 30 minutes from my house to get them speaks volumes.    Q-ROLLS!  Q-rolls are ridiculously delicious by themselves but when you add the sauce that it comes with its another level.  I have sincerely come here just to get two orders of these because they are that good.  They have ribs for every type of person.  I'm a fall off the bone rib guy but people I've dined with there are not, so Ive tried various types of ribs and each one were fantastic even though the baby backs were my favorite.   The wait staff have always been top notch and stellar with their recommendations and attention.  My ONLY complaint is that they are so far away but that isn't their fault.  I beg of you Bobby of the Q open another location!  Regardless of distance Its an amazing restaurant that I would find a way to visit even if it was on the moon.",

Our server was Nicole and she was literally the best server we have ever had. She made sure we were attended to and had a great personable conversation with us. The food was amazing as well. We had the pulled pork sandwich and the BBQ chicken sandwich which were both perfect. We are from the east coast towards the south so we have had our fair share of BBQ and this was by far the best we've had. The mac and cheese was great and we both got it as our side. For dessert we got the death by chocolate which once again was amazing. To top it all off they brought us little donuts as an end of the meal treat and they were so good we had to force them down as we were so full but they were just so amazing! We were checked on once again by two gentlemen who were hosting and both were amazing and made sure or experience was good. Both were extremely personable. Overall an amazing establishment and made our trip to Phoenix even better! We will definitely be back in the future!",

    "text": "Out with two buds tonight on a quest for some good BBQ and to zap a few other cravings. I've been here one or two times before but for whatever reason was never able to try a lot of things.  First off I love the atmosphere and decor of the place. Upscale bayou? can that exist? seems like they were able to do it. Plus its nice and dark and comfortable.  One thing I recall is how great the service is EVERY TIME i go. Three different visits.. three different servers.. top notch each time.  Food!  Appetizers  Wings: Delicious! These are smoked, fried, and then sauced. I hate(strong word on purpose) baked wings. I thought I was going to hate these but the combo of the smoked then fried works amazingly. It allows them to only flash fry for crisp. This keeps the wings juicy and plump but with the fried crispy skin that wings should have.  Brisket Fire-Pie: Don't bother :/ I knew this was risky but I had a pizza craving. Normally BBQ pizzas have way to much BBQ sauce. This was the opposite it had very little sauce.. so little that it had no flavor impact leaving you wondering what that funky after taste is.  Cornbread: Strong corn flavor.. not overly sweet. Could feel the grease/butter levels killing me not so slowly. But was good to the taste buds. ----------------- BBQ  Pulled Pork: Nice smoke flavor and good moisture content without being overly fatty. Not the best I've had but no complaints.  Brisket: Same feelings as the pork. It was good and executed properly but certainly not the best I've ever had. None of the BBQ was overly salty but some of it was to far on the other end of the scope and could have used some more salt. There was no real bark on the brisket which was a little disappointing.  Smoke Links: I didn't care for these at all. They were to fatty for my taste and needed more... something in your face. I think everyone agreed these were the our least favorite items.  Baby Back Ribs: Very tasty ribs but surprisingly not my favorite out of the three offered. These are usually the safe best for best ribs at whatever place your at. There was something out of whack with the meat itself. It failed to really pick up the smoke flavor maybe? They were moist and tender and fall off the bone. But fall off the bone on the side of smoked to long.  Beef Ribs: Surprisingly lean for beef ribs. Since they were so lean these could have used a little more time in the smoke unlike the baby backs. Beef ribs take a much longer time to break down to perfection.  St Louis Style Ribs: YUM! Best ribs on the menu. Next time this is all I will order in the rib category. Flavor was great., meat was great., still a little over done but it took nothing away from them. I would come back for this alone. -------------------  Sides  Mac & Cheese: Delicious but they went the fake cheese route. It is hard to make good mac and cheese the old fashion way. Its hard in small quantity let alone restaurant quantity. I would rather have them understand this and serve it with primarily fake cheese and be tasty then try and do from scratch and serve me curdled cheese fail.  Pecan Cole Slaw: Also sexy! Crisp, cold, refreshing, and not soggy. The nuts were a nice addition but if they could have somehow brought it out more in the dish it would have been ever better.  Potato Salad: Mmmmmm. This was great and a tie for best side dish with the mac and cheese. Be warned.. This is HEAVY. Its probably 90% mayo but its potato salad.. its not healthy don't try and make it healthy. They did it right. It took a year off my life and I loved every bite of it. Its the bad years anyway! Creamy, perfect amount of mustard, great seasoning, lots of fresh dill.  Beans: Interesting.. Sweet but not grossly sweet like some. Smokey but almost to a crazy level. When I tasted this I honestly felt like I was eating something with a liquid tobacco smoke flavor. It also had a lot of what was probably the BBQ beef in it. Not sure what I thought about this.  Planned Return Order: Wings St Louis Ribs Mac & Cheese Potato Salad Pecan Coleslaw  Get these if nothing else and I would be shocked if you didn't leave grinning ear to ear.  Pros: Great Service Great Atmospheric Acceptable Great to OK dish ratio 10% off for yelpsters!  Cons: Awkward Location Awkward Parking Pricey  For those still stumped by the \"how can fall off the bone be bad\" the best test for ribs done correctly would be ribs tender enough to pull apart with your teeth but ones you can pick up and hold by a bone and not have fall apart. If you pick up ribs by the bone and the meat stays on the plate and the bone comes up clean its been neglected. I know this sounds crazy to most but when you have enough ribs done properly you will taste and appreciate a rib that was on as long as it was supposed to be and no longer.",

    "text": "I ordered a smokehouse burger with mashed potatoes.  The BBQ sauce is amazing, plain and simple.  It has the perfect amount of sweet and tangy.  It didn't go too well with the thousand island sauce, but that's of little consequence.  The setting is great and the prices are about average.  It's a nice place to go to hang out with friends or with family.  That said, I do have 3 complaints.  1. I ordered my burger medium-rare, and I received medium well.   2. I felt very rushed to eat.  I was constantly asked if I'm finished.  Do I need a box?  etc.  Yes I know you have a line and I'm only one person, but I would still like to enjoy my meal instead of scarfing it down. 3. This is the worst offense.  I was watching the setting, and I noticed one waitress sneezed into her hand.  At first I thought she was going to go to the restroom to wash it off, but nope.  She turned and started to service another customer.  Yuck.",

Pulled pork and brisket to cry over they are so tender & smokey. My wife said she would happily go back. She had the fried chicken and loved it, though next time gravy on the side. She did try my pork & brisket and loved them too. Bobby Q is a definite BBQ lovers restaurant. Service by Linzy 1980 was quite good she was patient as we made up our minds as to what we wanted and when I explained I had ordered baby backs & beef bones but was served St. Louis and baby backs she promptly went back to the kitchen and brought the beef bones, only having a satisfied customer on her mind. We will be back! Oh yeah the onion ring loaf excellent and one of the three sauces they serve is sure to please your taste buds.",

We chose to sit on the patio which was a great choice as we had a pretty quiet meal. The mister's and the fans kept the area nice and cool even though it was close to 110 out.  We were promptly greeted by one of the best waitresses I've ever had the pleasure to be served by. She did her best trying to gently upsell us as is expected at restaurants these days, though she was far from being pushy.   The food was a little expensive in my opinion which is the reason for the 4 stars, though I probably would have gone 4 and a half because it truly was some of the best barbecue you could have.  Not a long wait either!   All in all it was a great experience, but as a warning, try and beat the dinner rush or you'll end up waiting for a long time. It's a pretty popular place.",

    "text": "I can't tell you how many times my husband and I have been here. We moved here a little over a year ago and a colleague took him to try it. He came home raving about it until I agreed to try it. It's a fun atmosphere and we went for our first and second anniversaries. Last month we took our newborn son for his first visit :) We love that the manager always walks up to your table to make sure your visit is going well. They also have response cards (usually on the table, but not always) that you can fill out with when you were there and how your server was. That definitely shows that they really care about the service they are providing. Though it's almost always very busy, they have great service and the food comes out quickly and hot. Speaking of the food.. My husband is obsessed with their ribs and spicy BBQ sauce (he always asks for his own BBQ sauce bottle to have at the table) He also loves their burgers and swears that the Mac n cheese is the best in the world. When I go I get the steak sandwich. It's juicy steak cooked to perfection on garlic bread with sauteed mushrooms, au jus sauce, and fried onion strings on the side, incredible. But in saying that.. I always try to go on Saturdays because they have a steak and crab special for $18. Their crab is to die for! They place a candle on your table with a butter tray above it that's perfectly melted and warm. I also love their shoestring fries. They give you complimentary cornbread during your meal and a bag of little donut holes afterward. I love this place. We went here three weekends in a row one time (We had different things to celebrate each time and didn't want to go anywhere else!) I love their specialty drinks too. Like most specialty drinks, they aren't cheap.. But yummy. The shipwreck is my fav. If you like good food and good service, GO HERE!",

I love barbecue. It is a hobby of mine. When I get stuck on something and want to know what it should look and taste like, I go to Bobby Q and am almost never disappointed. Most recently, this happened with beef brisket. I'm going to upload a picture I took of Bobby Q's brisket because seriously, if you look at it and don't want to immediately die from desire, then you just don't like barbecue. If I had anything bad at all to say about Bobby Q, it would be that sometimes their meats can be slightly overdone but this is not the norm. Their quality control, considering how much food they must serve to keep up with the demand, is astounding.  Their prices are too high, but of course, you're paying for the almost Disney-esque atmosphere. Their sauce is absolutely delicious (although it should be noted: they don't understand what \"spicy\" means). All in all I really can't say enough good things about this place. Go look at my brisket photo. Seriously.",

High ceilings with obligatory (this IS Phoenix after all) yet interesting leaf-looking fans, huge wood doors (non-functional) and unique and interesting antique pieces definitely added to the overall feel of the place for me.  I like places with some character.  Though the contrast with the more modern and trendy tables, chairs and centerpieces on the tables along with the high-energy model-slim all-in-black with plunging necklines waitstaff was odd for me.  I mean, pretty is pretty, but I'm looking for tasty food and a warm welcome, not warmth anywhere else if you know what I'm saying (that's what places like Hooters were made for, no?).  I'm a bit more low-key when I dine out, though I must compliment the attentiveness and overall service.  My iced tea glass was never empty and \"to go\" boxes (with Thank-Q donuts) were promptly brought when requested (eyes always bigger than stomach).  Now - the food.  Definitely the place to go when you're craving really tender meat. The brisket is divine and they had me at pulled pork. Seriously. Meat roasted for 18 hours and I didn't have to do it myself? Heaven!! Now everyone seems to rave about the mac & cheese, but personally I am in love with the ranch beans - with pieces and shreds of brisket and pork in it. I was surprised at how tasty it was. I'd do takeout just for that.  The spinach artichoke dip was a bit high-fat for me and I had to stop after a few bites though my dining companion was happy to finish it off. Tasty but heavy.  The peach cobbler was not my choice, but I did have some and it was ok for what it was but it didn't wow me.  I will definitely be back for more brisket, pulled pork and ranch beans, but I may just as well get it \"to go.\"",

    "text": "We had the opportunity to visit Bobby Q's for dinner on our last night of vacation in Phoenix.  It was dark when we headed out and their location put them about 8 miles away from our hotel.  As we headed into the area of town it is in, we began to worry that we had been given bad directions, but sure enough, past the high school here was this crazy, big building housing some of the best bar-b-que I've ever had.  It has a vast parking lot and as noted, is quite large.  Certainly larger than most bar-b-que joints I've been to.  We were greeted promptly and chose to eat in the bar area rather than wait 20 min for a table.  The fact that there was a wait at 7:00 PM on  a Thursday night again says something about how good this place is.  We were seated in a side by side booth near the bar, quite comfortable.  Patrick Buckley was our wait person, and should be teaching hospitality he was so good.  I had the baby back ribs and my wife had the \"Smoasted\" half chicken.  They started us with their amazing home made corn bread, and the meal came quickly behind.  Portions were good sized and the meal left us happy, happy, happy and waddling back to our hotel.  Although stuffed, we couldn't help ourselves and took an order of peach cobbler to go.  And, if that is not enough, before you leave they hand you bag of little home made sugar donuts they call \"Thank Q's\".  All of this and a full bar too.  I highly recommend going to Bobby Q's.  Take the drive, make the trip, you won't be disappointed.",

You get 2 choices of meats and 2 choices of pit ribs with 3 sides for $36 dollars !  We get a few extra order of corn bread. The meat on the ribs literally fall off the bones and the brisket is soooo tender!  They have a KIDS MEAL menu, but my son loves the baby back ribs with the sweet barbecue sauce.

I personally enjoy the ribs and fries at Bobby Q's though. I'm not a big fan of their pulled pork but that may just be me. I did like their mac and cheese and of course their check-in special! The little donuts at the end are also a nice treat. The reason I am not giving them 4 stars is because my friend seemed to have gotten food poisoning after eating here. I am sure they keep things clean, but somehow something got through. Again though, I'd still recommend this BBQ joint. Not too shabby, but not really WOW either.",

    "text": "Denise and I met our daughter and her boyfriend for dinner yesterday on my birthday. Always wanted to try this place. We started off with the Q-rolls, guess this is suppose to be trendy! Many restaurants are doing the same thing. hybrid of a egg roll and sandwich! This one was BBQ brisket deep fried like an egg roll! It was OK, not that bad. I ended up ordering their combo platter, sample of their ribs, sausage, and brisket ts. Sausage was great and spicy, and their ribs were very good. Wife had the fried chicken (boneless) I am not a fan of boneless chicken. No flavor! Get me a fried chick with bone, it will taste a lot better then bone out! So! Their chicken really had no flavor, wife was not impressed. Daughter had a burger that was huge, and it looked great! Wanted to try it, but I had enough on my plate already. Wife had a bite and said it was really good. We ended up have their peach cobbler, I tried a little. Not a big fan of peach, plus daughter already baked me a cake for my birthday. Wife again was not impressed by, said it was to doughy!  Biggest Con! Price! I have had better BBQ that cost a lot less. Spending $100.00 for four I expected it to be a little better.  Loved the place, would like to come back on a weekend evening to see how the atmosphere is!",

    "text": "I don't usually like to give a review after only having been to a place once but... I have never felt so welcome, so well treated, and so satisfyingly full after one visit!  I have definitely found my new favorite carnivorous dining place.   My friend Don S. checked in here one day and I asked him if he was clubbing because I had been to the lounge with my cousins before but didn't know much about the restaurant since it had changed from Bobby McGee's back in the day. He laughed! Told me they have an amazing burger! Say what? Bobby Q is a five minute drive from my house! How did I not know this?   I went last night with my son and let me tell you, one of the most pleasant dining experiences of my life! I ordered the smokehouse burger. It is 50 cents more than the regular burger and probably a hundred times better because it has bacon! Haha. I love my meat still pink in the middle and when I ask for something m.rare I would like it m.rare and preferably closer to the rare side. The chef hooked up my patty perfect! One of the best burger I have ever had! My little boy ordered the mac off the kids menu (love kids menus), and he loved it so much he ordered up a second helping! Sean our waiter was so kind and helpful and playful with the boy. It's so much more enjoyable when the staff is good with kids. Laura, who must have been management, came out to check on us mid meal and was also super sweet. She brought me out a sample of the brisket. Melty and delicious and bursting to the brim with flavor. She also told my son that if he tried the brisket she would bring him desert on the house! How cool is that?!? Of course he tried it, but more importantly he loved it! Then came.... Death by Chocolate! Its like an ice cream sandwich with brownie book ends! And so large that I only let Buddha tackle one part of it.   I cannot wait to come back and try more off the menu! Oh did I mention that they give you free donuts at the end of your meal? I mean who can eat donuts after this kind of meal! But they are just as tasty the next morning! YUM!  So impressed!",

The Sunday BBQ special with all the diffrent cuts of meat, enough for at least 2 (if not more) to share was great, and plenty to go around, at an extremely reasonable price.

We made our reservation & got there 15 minutes early & were seated by our reservation time. Everyone was extremely friendly! Our server, Justin, was polite & attentive. We ordered the giant platter that came with 4 choices of meat, a half pound each, & 3 sides. We ended up with the brisket, pulled pork, beef ribs & St. Louis ribs. Our sides were potato salad, pecan coleslaw & vegetables. Everything was delicious! My favorite was the brisket. The pulled pork literally melted in our mouths! The ribs were good but not the best I've had. The sides were delicious as well. The ambiance was very rustic & causal, just my kind of place! Prices were reasonable for what we got. The platter, a beer & glass of wine came to $66 after tax AND we had leftovers. Next time we visit Phoenix we will definitely be going back!",

I was expecting a plain boring salad but no; It was delightful with plenty of veggies and extras. I didn't particularly care for the side of ranch beans, felt like they could have done a better job with making those tastier.. Also loved their complimentary \"thank Q\" doughnuts.. They were warm and tasted somewhat like a churro... The ambiance was fun and pleasing to the eye and I even heard their a night club on the other side of the restaurant which sounds like fun too. Overall I suggest anyone to come try this place, I don't think you will be disappointed.",

The mashed potatoes were ok. and so was the Mac N Cheese as my 3 year old tore that up. My 8 year old tore up the RIBs and bone almost, lol. I wouldn't recommend Sunday's though as it was PACKED and took longer than anticipated. So if you're hungry and it's not Sunday, I recommend this place. The area is NOT my favorite place to be as I used to live literally on the same block (neighborhood) and it's kind of ghetto (IMHO). Lost 1 star for the Sunday wait and location.",

We all had the Smokehouse burger since a burger was what were were after.  It was juicy and perfectly cooked with crunchy onions and bacon and cheese.  Pretty perfect when you want a heart stopper.  The waiter forgot to order our appetizer of onion block (or whatever they call it), which was a blessing since the burger was huge.  Still the manager showed up moments later to apologize for the oversight and offer us a free dessert.  I love those extra customer service touches.

Great BBQ place, excellent food and good value. There's a Q lounge next door, so will definitely stop by the next time I'm in PHX.

Honestly, I did not get my hopes up, and prepared myself for a rough ride home. Yes, in case you are wondering, I have had some bad experiences with Seafood.  We decided to sit on the patio and were promptly attended to. I ordered a bloody mary, the rest beers. The bloody mary was freaking tasty. Spicy and tasty.   We all ended up ordering the Steak and Crab special. I ordered a Caesar to start with. The Caesar was good. Nothing amazing, but solid.  Then there came the Crab. Half a snow crab, with an 8oz Steak and a side of roasted corn. As I started drooling, my stomach did a backflip from excitement. The crab was awesome! Not chewy or fishy tasting. The steak was great as well, and the corn was nice and smokey.  The only negative...the server was a bit forgetful at times. Honestly, once the crab and I had our moment...I no longer cared..",

It's always a little scary to take someone to a place you've never been to but Bobby Q did not disappoint.  We started with their Q rolls for an appetizer. SO good. They are kinda like egg rolls but with brisket and they come with a chipotle dipping sauce that is really good.   I ordered the brisket sandwich (apparently I was in a brisket kinda mood) which comes with shoestring fries and I ordered a side of mac n cheese as well. I'm not kidding when I say this is some of the best beef brisket I've ever had. It was so tender, not dry at all and it had just the right amount of sauce - enough to give you that rich BBQ flavor but not so much that the meat is swimming in it. The fries were good but the mac n cheese was really good. VERY rich and creamy. I couldn't finish it all.  The boyfriend had chicken and mashed potatoes. He said the chicken was good but the potatoes came without gravy. Maybe they forgot it? So those were kinda dull.  Our friend got ribs and mac n cheese. The ribs looked amazing - fall off the bone type.  We stayed at the table really late - we were literally the last people in the place but they didn't seem to care that we were just hanging out which was cool.   We didn't go to the bar next door but it was packed and looked like a fun place to grab a drink.  Bobby Q turned out to be a great place to bring a visitor since they let us talk forever and the food was tasty and reasonably priced. I would definitely eat there again.",

We went for lunch and while it's decorated to look like a BBQ dive you can tell they wanted a \"trendy dive\" look if that even exists. I likes.  First you get the cornbread, which is my favorite so I started off happy. I had a salad, but two people got BBQ. I know - who gets a salad the first time they go to a BBQ restaurant? That makes no sense. They liked the meats and I think my husband said \"meh.\" about the sauce. The baby had mac and cheese which he loved (and I liked) and the chicken was also a winner.   I have to say - donuts at the end of the meal? Um, no. Ugh, no.They tasted pretty heavy with oil and sure enough after about 2 minutes I had the worst stomach pain of my life. Just say no to the donuts, I beg you. Unless you plan ahead and  know you are going to have a donut and you save some room, otherwise they will put you over the edge, and I am saying that after having a salad! I have never been anywhere that gives you donuts for your ride home, so I guess that is original on their part, right?  Overall, I will go back, this place was fun! Next time, pulled pork.",

The pulled chicken is amazing, the brisket tender and juicy, the ribs succulent and flavorful, best barbecue around.  The sides were delicious as well, mac & cheese was great, mashed potatoes did not disappoint, ranch beans aren't anything special but they tasted good.    Service was great, waiter was attentive to our needs and accommodated a last minute switch after already putting in the order. Atmosphere is good, not too noisy/quiet, the lighting could be improved though, a single bulb above the table barely allows you to see what you are eating, though the food wasn't there long enough to be seen:)  Highly recommended to someone looking for great barbecue ribs, chicken, brisket, etc.",

    "text": "Ok, I'm a BBQ fan. St. Louis, Chicago, Philly, Memphis, Texas I love em all. I have often dragged my wife on BBQ treks for hundreds of miles. With that being said I have to begin by saying that Bobby Q has EXCELLENT BBQ. Tender, smoky and chock full o' flavor. I have been here multiple times and have never had anything that disappointed me...until last night. An event so treacherous and diabolical that it prevented me from rating them with 5 stars. The horror!  The in-laws were in from the East Coast and we decided to take them there for dinner. Everything was smashing and up to par as usual until dessert came. Now I have to go on record as saying that I always loved the heaping pile of scrumptious peach cobbler that they serve on the dessert menu. So much so that I convinced my table of 6 to order 3 since they are usually large enough to share and stunningly delicious. Every time I go to Bobby Q I finish off my meal with it and love to complain to my wife as I waddle out of the building (in the grand tradition of glutinous American excess) that I ate too much and my belly hurt. I was looking forward to lamenting my fate yet again last night. But alas, I was in for a shocking turn of events and was dubbed a deceitful liar by the entire table.   To my horror when the cobblers arrived, they were measly, sickly, ill-prepared portions and a pale shadow of what they were on previous visits. We were plagued with three bowls of undercooked (as in practically raw) peaches that tasted like they were straight from a can and a soggy, undercooked thin square of \"crust\" sitting on top as an afterthought.  This flavorless absurdity could only have been more demeaning if it were capable of speech and threw dated insults at us. It literally looked like they dumped half a can of uncooked peach slices in a bowl and threw a wet piece of thin white bread on top. All three servings were like this. Now on EVERY occasion in the past the cobbler was gigantic, actually was cooked and warm, had a delectable FULL crust and tasted like it came out of Gramma' Cobbler's oven fresh. To this peach cobbler bizarro universe doppelganger I spit at thee and thine preparer. Bah I say. BAH.  Of course, we complained to the waitress who was nice but said she didn't know that it was any different from normal.  She went back to whoever prepared them and came back saying that the preparer said \"they're the same as they always were\" which either proved the preparer's incompetence or their willingness to shame the establishment with a bowl full of cobbler-like lies. Our waitress even said she talked to the manager who went back to speak with the preparer...but said manager never came out to either see the imposter cobblers or speak with us about it, which rates as quite poor customer service.  Overall, it left a dark mark on an otherwise belly -bustingly deeeelicious visit. Shame on you Robert Q, shame.   So, I will still eat at Bobby Q. as their dinner fare IS fantastic (assuming there are no more obvious but blatently denied changes such as with the cobbler), the environment is cozy and the staff are (generally) quite pleasant. However,  I will be wary about ordering the dessert in the future and about the quality and integrity of their customer service skills. I would advise you to use the same caution.",

I did some researching before heading last night and nowhere did I read about an age restriction in order to partake in the section where they hold the buffet. So when my husband and I and our friends, who had a baby with them tried going in we were shocked to learn we wouldn't be allowed to go in because we had a baby with us. Yet none of this information was posted any where so we were all surprised. Also the fact that there was no manager present did not help our situation, what place doesn't have a manager present at all times? What made things worst was how the host who went by choo choo came off to us as rude when dealing with our situation. We had a big group of friends waiting for us at the patio, where we could of easily been seated but had to turn away and leave our friends because they refused to let us go in. Disappointing costumer service to say the least.",

Corn bread served on the side compliments the BBQ cuisine but I didn't find it to be the best I've ever had; just OK. Something about the lack of heartiness of it threw me off. If you're in the mood for the richest mac and cheese you'll ever taste, grab a side. Soooo cheesy I felt like I had to take a break and eat my steamed veggies to prep my taste buds for more. Of course the french fries were tasty and mashed potatoes tasted like butter which is always a winner in my book.  The place itself is located in a bit of a weird place; you'd never think it was there. But when you find it and go inside, the overall feel is very welcoming. When you walk in you'll notice a server frying up donuts. Not sure if you grab these on the way out or what but we asked the server about it and got some delivered to our table to share. Great food and laid back atmosphere. BBQ is top notch, try for yourself.",

My boyfriend's favorite food is BBQ-anything so I left the ordering up to him (and the choice was easy): Whole Hog Heaven - 4 meat choices plus 3 sides. Settling on St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, BBQ Chicken, and Brisket, with sides of mac & cheese, coleslaw, and beans - he was as giddy as a kid on Christmas. I was pretty hungry too - and I had to admit the smell of BBQ wafting through the back kitchen door had my taste buds excited. The meal did not disappoint to say the least. The ribs were literally falling off the bone, the chicken was cooked perfectly, and the brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender. All 3 sides were the perfect addition, however I do have to say that the coleslaw was my favorite, especially paired with the brisket.  What sent us over the edge of BBQ heaven were the extra special additions before and after the meal. To start us off - homemade, warm cornbread with whipped butter. To finish us off - complimentary mini donuts (yes, you heard me right). Erg I would give 5 stars, but there was a hoard of drunken girls taking over the bathroom (there is a club attached to the restaurant?) that I found fairly annoying. Oh well. Highly recommended and we will be going back!",

The cornbread was also a highlight of the meal.    The sampler included ribs, bbq chicken and beef brisket.  Each were perfectly cooked, seasoned and super tender.  Of course I would recommend getting a little extra bbq sauce on the side, my preference was the hot which I loved!  They finish the meal off with a bag-o-donuts.. basically sugared doughballs.  Nonetheless they were very tasty and a nice, different take on a dessert for a bbq meal.  It was also nice that the bartender didn't scoff when I asked him to switch the tvs to ESPN (who wants to watch the news in the bar anyways?).  Not only that, but he put it up on all the tvs and raised the volume.  I had a really great lunch there and will be returning soon.",

Decor has a fun log cabiny feel. Very friendly, knowledgeable, helpful staff. We split the pulled pork sandwich with mac & cheese and calamari appetizers (unfortunately for me, I wasn't all that hungry). They brought out cornbread and gave us cute Thank Qs doughnut holes for a treat. We also got their sweet tea. And everything, literally all of it was great- like I'd actually recommend every bit of it to anyone! Well done Bobby Q!!",

    "text": "I'm sure it's been said nearly a thousand times before but this may very well be the best bbq in AZ. I'm a native Texan and used to eating some good Texas bbq but this is something to write home about. Jake our waiter states that they smoke their meats for 18 hours. The food tasted every bit like they did. I could really taste the smoke flavor with the sausage which they filleted open to soak up the flavor. I can tell you that it tastes like they use pecan and mesquite wood for smoking. I've passed this place thousands of times and smelled the fresh wood smoking and my only regret is not coming here any sooner. If you're bringing a group make sure to try the whole hog heaven. It's more than enough food for three people. The food was every bit worth the price!",

The ribs are amazing, ok the food was amazing, I would say the pieces of brisket I had were good but not Texas brisket! Could have been the cut I had but the ribs were \"slap yo momma good\"!!! I had corn and Mac and cheese as a side, the Mac is super cheesy borderline overly cheesy but the corn was good! My kids fries were very good too! Love the corn bread and we are awaiting our donuts!   I will be back although it seemed a bit pricey for bbq but they also didn't serve it on paper and plastic, they have real plates here! Lol!",

    "text": "So I've traveled various states and up and down California, always looking for as good a bbq I had when I was in Austin (actually Driftwood) at Salt Lick Restaurant. I use that place as the baseline for the best bbq I have ever had. Well, Bobby Q went as close to that level as ANY place I have been to since. The ambiance when you walk in sets the mood for carnivorous meal you are about to encounter. I went with the 3 meal combo, St. Louis ribs, Beef ribs, and the coup de gras sliced beef brisket. The St Louis and Beef were the damn near the best I ever had. I typically ask for the sauce on the side, so I can taste the meat and carefully add the sauce on my own, but this time I forgot. Regardless, it was cooked perfectly and sauced just enough, so the meat was still the star of the plate. The meat came perfectly off the bone and with the sauce was amazing. Herein lies why they didnt get the 5th star. The sliced brisket, although tasty, lacked the nice smoke ring and was cooked a bit too long. Again, it was still delicious, but I couldnt give the 5th star because of that. Also, the mac n cheese, which they say is very popular, was starchy (mind you I dont mind cheese) but the that was lacking in the taste. I washed it down with West Coast IPA from tap so that was a plus as well! And of course, complimentary to the meal was cinnamon sugar mini donuts, 2 per customer that came out with the bill. This was my first foray there, but will definitely not be my last while my son is attending college in AZ. My hats off to this place, as I told that to our waitress that night, as well as the manager.",

The BBQ brisket was tender and moist, my bf is from the south and was very impressed with the authentic Carolina BBQ sauce. The service was really above and beyond, at least 3 different staff members came to check up on us and everyone was SO friendly. (A certain resort in Sedona could learn from the people here!).   The strawberry lemonade was super sweet and after you've stuffed yourself on delicious, moist BBQ, they give you 4 donuts in a bag with your check. Great idea because a bag of beignets certainly makes paying easier, though the food and service were so good, paying would never be a burden here.   If you like BBQ, you MUST come here! We'll be back for sure!",

The ribs really stood out for smokiness and tender. I have to say too that the coleslaw was among the best I have ever eaten (pecan coleslaw). Oh yeah - constant re-supply of incredible cornbread biscuits!  As much as the food, the service was noticeably top notch. Various servers kept us informed about their role (drinks, taking order, bringing food, etc.) and our main server was attentive and well paced. The manager checked in and asked how we were enjoying our meal. Even the hostess gave us good information about where to sit.   Venue: great lighting, comfortable seating, roomy (but not too much) tables and well managed noise level. All good.  Value: $55 for two including tip and one drink each. Wow - for that meal, service and atmosphere, a tremendous value. Go here.",

    "text": "My girlfriend from Oregon and I had a delicious meal at Bobby Qs restaurant tonight. Initially, we had a minor situation with the menus each having different prices. The manager was very gracious and offered us the lower-priced menu.  Very professional and very friendly.  LeeAnne was our server and she was a 10.  !!!!My girlfriend ordered a steak sandwich. The steak was grilled to perfection with a glazed caramelized sauce that brought out the steak's flavors. It was thick and juicy and so flavorful covered in grilled mushrooms served with onion rings so tasty I ordered one to go. Their potato soup is almost a meal in itself. It is so flavorful with cheese and bacon and chopped onions and potatoes I could've eaten another bowl instead I got one to go. Bobby Qs gives you a small bag of homemade donuts to thank you for enjoying their restaurant. Give it a try for sure.  Second review:  treated friends today to Bobby Qs for burgers and steak sandwiches. Kyle served us and he was beyond on top of keeping us satisfied. Actually I was the one who got treated today.  Manager Taylor himself took care of a minor problem I had with my steak. He solved the issue as fast as humanly possible.  He gave me the BEST customer service ever in any restaurant I've eaten. Food so wonderful; service the same.",

As a French, my only regret was on the chicken: although the sauce was very tasty, I believe that the quality of the meat was rather poor. But I guess it is complicated to find a good \"poulet fermier\" (free range chicken) in the US ;-)",

    "text": "I am mixed on this one as a \"go to\" place for an every time college-parent-visiting-out-of-towner. We enjoyed the experience, but probably once tried once satisfied. This is your traditional, but unique, big-shack BBQ atmosphere with a donut twist. As you walk up, the smells are incredible and you are greeted by very friendly people. I ordered the 3 sampler of pork, brisket and sausage. The sausage was smoked to perfection - very good. The others seemed on par with any other good bbq sampling - not disappointed but not blown away. Certainly worth a four-star, but not tickled plenty as a 5 star - bbq rarely is. The problem is we ate a bunch, and It stays with you for a while. Advice is start small and come back often if you love bbq. The parting sugar donuts are a great benefit, but made with peanut oil so allergies beware. Too heavy to be a go-to spot every time.",

Absolutely phenomenal pulled pork sandwich, best I have ever had to date, bar none. Really good baked potato, excellent service, great ambiance, free corn bread that was also pretty good. At the end of the meal the waitress brought us a little bag of tiny cinnamon donuts that were made just seconds before she brought them to us, scrumptious.  I was also given a sample of the brisket, it was really good too.  Look out Joes BBQ!!! (And I love Joe's) When Bobby Q's opens this fall at Stapley and I-60 you are gonna take a hit.  Given the opportunity, we will revisit Bobby Q's when We're on that side of town.  (Kudos to our very pregnant and excellent waitress today, 15% tip to her and 15% tip to the baby. My wife just had her first Chemo treatment for breast cancer and is rapidly losing her hair, the great food and service really cheered her up today and she really needed that. Thank you!!!)",

Drink was well mixed and presentation was excellent. For dinner I had the two meat combo. Baby back ribs were great, flavorful, fell off the bone and not too sloppy. Brisket was okay, texture was solid but just an underwhelming sauce. Cornbread was unique and again, great presentation. Portion sizes were very large. Best part of the meal were the side dishes. The Mac and cheese had some great flavor with even better consistency (no runny cheese) and the mashed potatoes were extremely fresh. After the meal be sure to take home some fresh donut holes for free. They taste like mini elephant ear rounds. Average to above average BBQ, but a great atmosphere with tasty complimentary side dishes.",

This restaurant has a simple menu, fair prices, wonderful Happy Hour specials and FREE Cinnamon Sugar Donuts for all!!  (Get an extra bag to go!)  You can't go wrong with anything you order here.  All meats, chicken and fish too, are moist, tender, seasoned very well and are very filling.  My favorite side dishes there are the macaroni and cheese (da bomb!), Pecan Coleslaw (yes...Pecan!) and their shoestring French fries, with BBQ Sauce as a dip!    That's all well and good, but what keeps me coming back is their BRISKET!!  Hot damn!  Lean, tender, juicy and addictive!!  You'll be dreaming of Bobby Q Brisket in your dreams that night!  Their Brisket, Ribs and PRIME RIB (ahhh) are the top three sellers at Bobby Q!   They have a WONDERFUL lunch menu, but what I like is that they don't skimp on serving size for lunches.  You get a ton of meat and normal size side dish.  You just pay a few dollars less.  That's always good.   Don't forget the FREE Cinnamon Sugar Donuts at the end of your meal.  Grab an extra bag of them as you leave.  I've also seen people grab a bag of them as they go in as well!  No one there will tell you that you will spoil your meal by doing that so have at it!",

The service was fantastic- it was packed but we waited half the time we were told. They have a great outdoor seating area with lots of shade and indoor waiting as well. Our server Jessica (in the bar area) was really great! Super friendly, kept our drinks full, our table cleared of unwanted dishes, personable, great with our three year old and just all around a great server.   The food was phenomenal! We had the BBQ pulled pork, chicken, and 3 kinds of ribs. All were fantastic but the pulled pork and ribs were melt off the bone delicious! The complimentary cornbread and sugar donuts are not only a nice touch but we're really yummy and a fabulous way to start and end the meal! The coleslaw and Mac n cheese are also worth mentioning as they were very good too! If you have room for desert the Death by chocolate is also worth it, so much that if you can squeeze anymore food in take one to go! You won't regret it!",

    "text": "All around amazing restaurant! I have seen this restaurant on a MUST try in a list somewhere but forgot the name. So I decided to enlist Yelp for help when I was in the Arizona area for Spring Training this year. What strike me was the 1300+ yelp reviews and the 4.5 stars rating. I knew I had to bookmark this. Reservation was easy as I did it on open table (4:30PM on a Monday).  My bf and I arrived earlier and sat at the bar. That's when I learned the hard way that Arizona has a law that prohibits selling alcohol to anyone with a vertical ID, even though they might passed the age of 21. (Yes, I'll be renewing my license this month as it expires next month). Oh well...  The full party arrived and we were led to a table for 6 in the back. We were promptly greeted by our server, Riley. He made us feel welcomed with his friendly attitude and provided us with a great recommendation for appetizer, the Q-roll! Everyone enjoyed it and it set a good note for the rest of the evening.  All the \"adults\" except me got the Bobby Q Amber Ale that went really well with the BBQ, while I got the frozen strawberry lemonade. It was delicious! They served us complimentary circular shaped cornbread before our main course, that was really good too. This is coming from someone that doesn't blink twice for cornbread. Then our order of the Whole Hog Heaven and a rack of the St. Louis Style Ribs came. That was the perfect amount for our group of 6 adults. We only had 2 ribs left and everyone was stuffed! To top off the amazing meal, our server gave us a bag of homemade cinnamon sugar donuts to take home. Overall, I was so glad my choice for dinner was a success!  Parking: A big private lot. There are spaces reserved for to-go orders.  Atmosphere: Outdoor patio, bar and dimly lit indoor seating.   Good for: Dates (not really for first dates unless you don't mind eating BBQ), catching up with friends, small and big groups (family, friends, celebration, birthdays, etc.)  Service: Super friendly and accommodating. Right when I entered, the hostess was smiling and ready to help. Our server was awesome!  Food: Amazing. Don't even need a knife, it just melts off the bone! Whole Hog Heaven for groups of 4! Try the Amber Ale or the frozen strawberry lemonade.  Apparently, they'll turn into a nightclub on St. Patrick's Day. I'll definitely be back if I'm back in this area! :)",

We have seen this place for years driving by and now we finally decided to try it. The patio was soooo pretty they had string lights everywhere. I love the ambiance. The inside was pretty too, but we kinda got stuck in a corner near a sink? I would have probably preferred the patio.  The service was great, and the food came out fast. The server welcomed us first timers very well, and talked about the awards the restaurant was won which was pretty cool.   We decided to split a three meat plate and an extra side: baby back ribs, pulled pork, brisket with mashed potatoes, ranch beans, and macncheese.  The meat were very tender and the bbq sauce was good, I added a little bit of the spicy bbq sauce (not really that spicy tho). I felt like the bbq was soft and tender but it was also a little bland? I don't know maybe there was too much hype on this place that I set the bar in my mind so high? It was good but I thought it would be so much better. The sides were pretty good too especially the mac n cheese. Oh and I ordered the frozen lemonade which was nice (wasn't too sweet), felt like I was drinking a margarita ;)  Everyone else did enjoy the meal very much...maybe it's just my taste buds..hmmm...well I'd def come back for more to try it more...  Ooh the bread was sooo good yumm!  3.5stars for me for now",

The restaurant has a rustic, western feel; it's casual as well. Service was spot on - fast and friendly.   Started the evening with the fried Calamari. What's different about this calamari, compared to most, is that their pieces are large (think chicken tenders), but don't be intimidated. It's cooked perfectly so it's not too chewy and has a great texture. The panko breading puts it over the top with the extra crunch factor it's has.  As a group, we got the house salad, soup of the day (potato cream soup), and the Whole Hog Heaven. Soup was very good - it has a thick consistency with bits of bacon and cheese but nothing special. The Whole Hog Heaven comes with corn bread which was one of my favorite part to the course. It's light soft on the inside, descent layer of crust on the outside, savory and not too sweet. The beef ribs were BOMB! The baby ribs were good as well, but not my favorite or the best (kind of wish I had tried the the St. Louis instead of the baby backs). Sausages were good; if they were spicy, it would have been amazing. The brisket were one of my favorites, but they were not consistent in texture (some pieces were slightly dry while most pieces were melt-in-your-mouth delicious). Our sides consisted of the mac & cheese, shoestring fries, and ranch beans. All of the sides were good but nothing unique. The ranch beans were my favorite of the 3.",

Talk about delicious food, you can't go wrong here! We had a variety of food at our table because there was 7 of us, and everything was a hit! We debated going back before we left out of town! It's a bit pricey but it's definitely a get what you pay for kinda place! Not to mention the service was right on point with everything, not to mention the delicious mini donuts that was a fun surprise for the kids! This is MUST try kind of place! Make sure you grab some appetizers I think that was my favorite part of my meal here!",

It comes with mash potatoes and choice of one side (I chose Mac&Cheese....I know two starches). The cornbread is complimentary, super hot and yummy. My friend ordered the baby back ribs with Mac and baked potatoes (2 starches again). I tried some of her ribs and they were really good, falling off the bone good. I definitely would come back when I visit Arizona. I would love to try the pulled pork or the beef brisket. At the end of your meal they give you a bag of complimentary donuts that resembles the taste of churros.   My waiter was really nice and very attentive to us as we told him it was our first time dining at the establishment. The manager even walked over to us to make sure everything was fine. The staff appeared to be really nice and courteous.",

Q rolls are a must, the 3 meat plate is plenty to share and at a very reasonable price, and all of the selections are amazing; from brisket to the chicken to the sausage. Sides are delicious and the freshly made doughnuts top it all off. Add to that the roomy dining room and large patio, it's a place we take all our guest and visitors to the valley. Only odd thing is that it's a night club on weekend evenings and can get a little crowded if you come later on those days.",

It was a bit like the consistency of mashed potato.  As a WSM owner, I've made my fair share of brisket and pulled pork.  I've never turned out a spongy brisket.  Ribs were fall off the bone which is all about marketing.  For fellow BBQ fans, we know that this means over cooked.    Perhaps it was just an off night for the brisket?  All in I would go again.",

Great craft cocktails - we had a few minutes wait so decided to order a drink at the bar. I really liked the cocktail menu and they had a good variety of beers on tap as well. Before we took our first sip, our table was ready. So off went to the dinning area. Our server was very helpful and gave us a few tips on what they are know for, what he likes and answered any questions we had. He was training a new server and I felt he did a great job demonstrated how to help a first time customer. The plates are huge! we had enough for lunch the next day. My cousin got the fried chicken, which was a crispy fried boneless chicken breast. It was very moist and super crunchy. The gravy on the mashed potatoes are is just like the gravy my grandma makes.   My husband and I had a three meat combo and tried the ribs, hot link and brisket. All of them were moist and delicious. The beans were super yummy, my husband always bases his review of bbq on the beans and these got an A+.  At the end they bring you a little bag of fresh hot, sugary sweet mini donuts. Ohhh be still my heart. We even had enough for our morning cup of coffee the next day.",

    "text": "There are two things that I am certain of right now.   1.  The huge mega fight this weekend is a hoax.   2.  Bobby Q is the REAL DEAL for the style of BBQ it is.  I have eaten at BBQ all over the USA.  I know there are different types for each different region too. This place is very fantastic.    The cute server Megan did a fantastic job explaining the menu.  She was on top of the drinks and asked us if we needed anything at the right time is seemed.  Very happy with the Megan.  Great job kiddo.  The food was really good.  I am not sure if Bobby Q is a certain style.  I have to research that a bit.  We ordered some little rolls that reminded me of taquitos and some onion thing too.  The onion thing was good.  The little rolls were out of this world.  They came with a BBQ sauce and a chipotle sauce too.  There were six and that was perfect for the three of us.    We ordered a platter that Megan explained to us.   The platter came with two types of ribs, pulled pork and brisket.  I got the side of veggies.  The others got beans and mac and cheese.  I requested a vinegar base BBQ sauce because that is what I love.  The other guys got a molasses based sauce.    Food tasting time.  I sampled the brisket first and holly f n sugar jiminy Christmas batman.  That brisket was very good.  I moved on to sample both of the ribs styles we ordered and they were awesome.  Falling off the bone.  The pulled pork was great with my vinegar based sauce too.  The cornbread was really good too.   The meal was really good.  I am impressed and can not believed I lived close to this place and never tried it.  I like this place and recommend it to anyone.  Please remember food is subjective and likes are different.  We have seen a good boom over the last handful of years in BBQ here.  They are all different styles too.  Texas style, Memphis style and so on.  Like I said give this place a try.  Bring wet naps or ask for some.  You will need them.",

    "text": "(Before I say anything, order the Q Rolls. I don't see a single possible way anyone could be disappointed by them. Unless you don't eat meat, and then I feel sorry for what you're missing out on.)  Finally went off the beaten path (literally) and tried Bobbie Q's after years and years of driving right by it along the I-17. If you're anything like me, you thought it may have looked a little questionable from the freeway. Old perhaps, run down, neglected? Let me assure you, none of these are the case at all. Once you navigate the side streets to find this hidden gem, you are sure to be pleasantly surprised just as we were.   Prepare to be greeted at the hostess station inside a beautifully kept up and clean dining room. You may notice the donut machine just behind the hostesses making fresh little donuts which will be warm and waiting for you on the way out. Once seated, I highly recommend you order the Q Rolls, as stated at the beginning of the review. The beef brisket wrapped up inside them is out of this world good. Great dipping sauces too.   For the entrees, we had a loaded baked potato with shredded chicken, a pulled pork plate, a brisket sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich. Aside from one small complaint of a little bit of extra fat in the pork plate serving, everything else was excellent. Didn't notice the fattiness in the pulled pork sandwich I had half of, so I'm guessing it was just a fluke. The half a brisket sandwich was outstanding and the potato with chicken was also very good. Tons of side dish choices too; sure to be something for everyone.  As for the service here, the servers and managers don't appear willing to let anyone get out of there unhappy. They pride themselves on having happy (and most likely return) customers. Just look at their current Yelp rating; that's not easy to do! We had two different managers come over and check on us at two different points during our meal. Our server took great care of us, even hooked my mom up with extra cornbread. Totally made her night. And to all of the guys out there: ice cubes in the urinals when it's time to relieve yourselves. How many places can claim that? ;-)",

I always get the two meat combo, but this time I got the filet mignon and it was DELICIOUS! The macaroni and cheese is to die for, as well as the mashed potatoes! The Q rolls are absolutely out of this world and practically take me to a different dimension. You will not regret making a trip here, and waiting for 30 minutes, because you HAVE TO TRY THIS. The restaurant managers are so sweet, and walk around to see how your food is and make sure you are satisfied. GO WHILE THE GETTIN IS GOOD!",

So moist and soft that it falls apart if you try to grab it with a fork. Perfect amount of sweet and bread-y taste.  Q-rolls - brisket inside a croissant roll, tasty.  Brisket - the brisket here is so amazing tasty with the most tender consistency. I love it here, I could eat a bunch of it. Highly recommend getting brisket.  Baby Back Ribs - Very tender, falls off the bone and great flavor in the sauce.  Donuts - On the house! Made fresh, extremely warm with cinnamon on the outside.

    "text": "BOBBY Q BBQ. It's so clever! Honestly when we drove past this restaurant to get to our motel...we were busy making fun of their name. That is until we found out that they made Yelp's 100 Places to Eat and we found ourselves waiting 50 minutes for dinner. Not laughing anymore. I highly recommend making reservations because this restaurants get very crowded. Thankfully this did not affect the service at all! We were taken care of from the minute we walked in, to the minute we walked out.   Their menu has a little bit of everything so you're bound to find something that interests you. We started our meal with their Spinach Artichoke Queso Dip (with garlic bread) but honestly you don't even have to! Their house corn bread is delicious with their butter and can easily count as an appetizer with all the free refills they give you. With that said, the artichoke queso dip was also quite tasty. I just prefer my artichoke dip with chips rather than bread. The bread was just a little too buttery for me which made the appetizer feel very heavy. For our entrees, we ordered the Three Meat Plate (brisket, sausage, ribs) and their Jumbo BBQ Potato (all the usual fixings and brisket.  We absolutely loved the BBQ here. We've tasted some of the best bbq in Texas and I have to say that you can find some of the best right here in Phoenix, AZ. Everything was tender, fall off the bone delicious. I especially loved their brisket and my husband thought their sausage was great. I loved their BBQ sauce too. I even liked their sides! Their Mac-n-Cheese was rich and decadent, their pecan coleslaw was tangy and refreshing and their roasted corn was a little too smoky but that is purely a personal preference (less smoke is better for me). As for my Jumbo Potato, it was stuffed to the brim with all the fixings and very satisfying. We were absolutely stuffed after this meal.   Our meal ended with some fresh house made donuts covered in cinnamon sugar. It was a great finish and we really appreciated all the effort put into excellent customer service. The managers were all out and greeting guests as well as cleaning tables! That was really nice to see. Anyways, I never thought that I would find a good BBQ restaurant in Phoenix but I was wrong! Next time I'm here, I'm definitely coming back for some great food! 5/5",

Potter, like Harry\"Potter\" was our server and she was very attentive and did an excellent job, keeping our drinks filled and checking on us, very attentive. The manager, Taylor stopped by to check on us too. We couldn't ask for better service. Now, the food. We were a party of 5, skipped the appetizers and I'm so glad we did. We ordered 2 of the Hogs Dinners which said they were for 2, but they were enormous and could have easily fed 3 big eaters, plus a 1/2 slab of the Baby Back Ribs and 2 sides. On the 1st one, we had ribs, both Baby Back and St Louis style, Brisket, Rotisserie Chicken plus 3 sides, Mac & Cheese, Mash Potatoes and Roasted Corn. The second platter had Sausage, Brisket and Ribs; plus 3 more sides.  We had so much food left over! I wish Potter had told us not to order the extra dinner. If you're in the area, don't be put off by the location, stop there. You won't be disappointed.",

He made just the right recommendations and was very polite while engaging.  The winner of the evening was the moist and plump rotisserie chicken, accompanied by the two sides which were shoestring fries and mac n cheese. The chicken was to die for and made all the supermarket rotisserie chickens look bad...the chicken was not only juicy but it was supremely tender and melt in your mouth - too bad there wasn't more of it...

UH-MAY-ZING!! christin was our server, she was very knowledgeable about the smoking methods and the different kinds of meat. she really helped us to narrow down a choice (so many delicious sounding items on the menu)! she was funny and very personable which made the dining experience that much more enjoyable. the endless cornbread is TO DIE FOR. it comes out warm with butter, it melts in your mouth! the portions are huge so there's plenty to take home for round two.",

I guess my only complaint is that the ribs were too tender for my liking, completely falling off the bones - making it hard to eat them.   Sides were bomb, mac and cheese was delicious and the corn was great.   I would definitely come back here to eat - but might consider what other BBQ options there are before, simply in the sake of trying something new.. not because I was disappointed here at all! Great food and really fantastic service.",

Location is a little odd because you have to drive through a residential area. Overall cool place!",

    "text": "This place looks great, its incredibly spacious, amazing southern decor, insanely clean bathrooms and extremely friendly people.  The food is incredible, especially their ribs, we did the HEAVENLY HOG which is supposed to be for 2 people but TRUST ME you need a third person to finish this off otherwise you will die driving back home due to the most incredible food coma of your life. The hog consists of 4 meats and 3 sides, the meats are plentiful and we got baby back ribs, st louis ribs, brisket, and sausage and sides were mac n cheese, string fries basically thin fries, and ranch beans which were basically pinto beans and some pulled pork inside (i didnt taste any ranch).  Baby back ribs were 5/5 for sure, super tender and fall off the bone type, one of the best i've ever had. St louis ribs were also 5/5 and slightly different flavor and has some of that cartilage but i dig that stuff so nom nom. The brisket was very lean and smoky on the sides, which some people like but I was eh about it, I think i just dont like brisket all that much in general unless its slightly fattier than usual so this one was just alright for me 3/5. The sausage is really interesting in that its a bit dry, but they have this marinade prior to it at least it tastes like it did and has a really smoky flavor which i thought was interesting but overall just decent, 3.5/5. The mac n cheese is some of the cheesiest/creamiest mac n cheese you will ever have it was seriously some of the best ever in my opinion and I dont usually even like mac n cheese 5/5. Beans were fairly standard with the pulled pork, good if you like pinto beans 4/5. The string fries could be better in that it was fairly standard fries but slightly hard, not really but just if i had to nitpick 3/5. Overall you get A TON of food for $48 and i highly recommend you have 3ppl eat it despite the menu saying 1 really person could consume this, highly unlikely unless you're a competitive eater.   Complementary corn bread is given prior to the meal and IT IS THE BEST CORN BREAD EVER its so good that I forget why I used to hate corn bread. Oh right probably because just about everywhere else I've had it it was always dry and bland, but this place is the ultimate exception 5/5. Also after you pay you get complementary donut dessert and I think they say they bake that in house and its a super light, fits in the palm, a small super sugared donut and its also delish 5/5. I'll definitely come back here and probably one of my fav bbq places of all time.",

The meat was juicy and tender. The babyback ribs, flavorful and moist. The appetizer course would have been a great main course. The Q rolls were like brisket lumpia with BBQ sauce or chipotle mayo. The apple cobbler for dessert was just the right combo of sweet and tart. 3for3. Either Chelsea is lucky or she's a Bobby Q's savant. I'd go with the latter.",

The baby backs were cooked to perfection, with the meat falling off the bones.   The baby backs were delicious and wonderful.   The other meats - brisket and St. Louis Style ribs - were also very, very good.  The service was excellent - prompt, courteous, and attentive.

As a consultant and general contractor, I've been able to travel around quite a bit in the Central and Western US. Everywhere I went, there was always something wrong about the Q.  I stepped onto the Bobby Q \"campus\" (big property) and was immediately 'greeted' by beautiful shrubs and trees. The exterior is intentional, laid-back, and I love it. It sets you at ease so you can get ready for some great food. It reminds me of the roadside shacks we'd stop at on our family fishing trips in Texas.   When you walk in the front door you're greeted by people who have \"tenure\". Some of the wait staff have been with the owner over 20 years. Now that's a testament to good business. We (my wife and I) were seated and served their awesome cornbread and butter. Our server took great care with us since we were 'newbies'.   I had the Brisket, St. Louis Baby Back Ribs and Chicken. HOLY HANNAH - When that brisket hit the tastebuds, I thought I had reached Nirvana then stepped in Valhalla. My eyes rolled into the back of my head and I let out a let out a slight guttural sound of satisfaction. If I wasn't so hungry I would have stopped at that first bite knowing I had reached the apogee of barbeque gastronomy.   Well, I'll spare you the ennuis of the rest of my experience, but suffice it to say that you too, could reach your barbeque Nirvana by coming here. Have I been back? YES!!! I will keep coming back to get my \"fix\". I hope you enjoy too.",

The beans with zest, the M&C takes me back to old school cafeteria, the potato salad was fantastic and the slaw was great with the pecan.  Brisket was the clear winner from the table and we all loved the smoky sausage. The pulled pork was a disappointing third as it was dry. Good thing I went with brisket.  Two thumbs up here kids.

We asked for service & nothing happened, but you know how they say things happen for a reason so upon leaving we went to Red Thai at 12th st & Northern. Absolutely delicious & service was wonderful.

We came around lunch time so we were able to get seated right away. I can honestly say with full truthfulness that the pulled pork sandwich was one of the best I've ever had. The meat was so tender, it just melted in my mouth. The BBQ sauce on it had the perfect flavor to match the pork. The mac n cheese side and corn bread were pretty bomb too. Overall, I highly recommend this place-- our server was great, the atmosphere is very stimulating and comfortable. The manager even stopped by our table to thank us for coming in. I'll definitely be back!! Thank you!",

I did the 3 meat combo beef ribs, st louis, and brisket with sides of mac and cheese and roasted corn. The sauce on the meat was perfect not too sweet and not too overwhelming, they do give you a jar for added sauce and a option to add their spicy sauce (highly recommend). The meat falls right off the bone and melts in your mouth like ice cream. The mac and cheese was so good it had melty cheesy hearty goodness to it. And the roasted corn was ok, due to im a corn on the cob type of guy. The concept of the restaurant may look deceiving, but once you walk in is like walking into a 4 star restaurant. It gave the presence of comfort with immaculate service. Even the manager that was working both Wednesday and Thursday even recognize us and gave us that welcoming feeling. Definitely a place to come back to when visiting Phoenix. Thank you Bobby Q staff for an awesome service and great food. 5 stars all around.",

Aside from the great BBQ, they also offer daily lunch specials. My favorite is the Wednesday Prime Rib sandwich special which may well be the best sandwich I have ever had. I also recommend the Monday Chicken Club sandwich and the Thursday spicy meatloaf. They also have a Tuesday \"Qban\" (Cuban) sandwich and a Friday fish special. Pretty easy access too, right off the I-17. Just get off at either Northern, then head north on 27th av, or at Dunlap, then head back south on the I-17 frontage road. All I ask is that if you come on Wednesday, please leave a prime rib sandwich for me!",

This goes for items like free bread, butter, candies at the end of the meal and especially the free donuts they give me before I leave Bobby Qs. Those definitely do not count towards my waistline. Bobby Qs is a your run of the mill BBQ restaurant with fun (and slightly cheesy) decor, fatty yet satisfying and tasty food and overall a fun time. This restaurant is hidden off of random side streets but the catch is that you can see it from the 17.   Like I said, the food here is fatty but pretty good. Expect BBQ food with a chain-like feel. The atmosphere is the same. In summary, if you're in the area and get hungry, this is a great option. I think it would also be fun for a low key group dinner. Plus, they serve those donuts. Yum.",

But, at least 75% of the cheese was Velveta/processed cheese. It was smooth even when cold, real cheese doesn't do this.  But, again tasted very good.  Just don't exaggerate about its contents.  Thursday night at 6pm, they were busy and the speed proved that. 30min for two medium rare steaks. They were also still prepping the coleslaw due to them running out, which I received at the end of the meal.  Come earlier than 5:30pm!  Now, the Q-Rolls are absolutely awesome! Flakey, tasty and unique. Get them!  We ordered the 12oz Sirloin. Server stated 60 day aged in-house. It was super tender, flavorful and beautifully prepared! Seasoning very tasteful. If you like your steak well done, they you just burn your money away.  Medium or medium rare only!  The beans are very steak house like. Tangy, sweet with a depth of flavor.   Servers are highly trained, consistence, very nice table-side manor.   We'll be back and hopefully changing this review to 5-Stars. Have to do 4-stars now now.",

Been there about 5 times and everything is good. They have large group deals making it pretty cheap. Also right when you walk in you see a donut making machine, and they give you donuts when you finish your meal which is awesome. Freshly baked and very fluffy.   I come back often",

Ciara took care of us, the Q rolls gave us a taste of the brisket and wow it set the stage! The Qcolada drink was unreal, the girl loved it. Q amber ale didn't disappoint either! We had to try both the St Louis and the baby back, just to get a sample. ;) bbq chicken rounded out the meal. Shoestring potatoes were a favorite, as was the mac and cheese. I had been looking for a solid bbq place and Bobby definitely delivers the goods. Will be back.",

Menu was easy to read properly organized. Restrooms looked and smelled clean.   Service: Received by staff with a smile. Leanne (our server) explained the menu and informed us that they smoke their meat low and slow. She always checked on our food and asked us if we needed anything else. We asked for a different sauce every time she visited our table and she provided us options every time. Manager visited our table to check on the sevice and food. I appreciate it when staff makes sure we are enjoying our visit.   Food: Exceptional bbq!!! Prime brisket was juicy and tasty. Baby back ribs were very tender and falls off the bone but still has that chewy texture that releases more flavor. Sausage is sweet and garlicy. A perfect pair for something starchy like mashed potato or rice. Beef ribs are tender and the fat around it is full of smoky goodness. Corn bread is a sweet and salty goodness. Want a great appetizer, try the Q-rolls.  I'll be back. This will be my go to BBQ in AZ.",

    "text": "4.5 stars.....I really battled over scoring this fine establishment. So let me break it down:  Setting: 5 stars-Great decor, lots of televisions, dim lighting, and just a comfortable feel.  Staff:  5 stars- Our waiter was awesome. I am very frustrated with myself for not remembering his name. He checked on us often and really took care of my party of 8. The manager also walked by and checked on us. Class act all the way around.   Food: 4.5 stars- The food was great. The sides (French fries, potato salad, Cole slaw, Mac and cheese) were awesome. Each side could not have been any better. As for the meat, it too was very good. The problem I have is I compare everything now to the barbecue spot Little Miss Barbecue.  The meat (pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and ribeye) was moist and flavorful. Better then Little Miss? No, but it was darn good. I really would love to give the meat a five but that would not be fair to Little Miss. For dessert, we knocked out the bread pudding and their complimentary mini donuts. The bread pudding was not on their menu but it needs to be. It needs to be their go to dessert. It was amazing!!!!! Loved it!!! LOVED IT!!! The donuts were so fresh and a real treat.  Bobby Q's is legit for sure. I would and will stop by again. I really wish I could give it 4.5 stars. What a nice meal/time.",

We had some kind of brisket appetizer suggested by our waitress (who was such a sweetheart), and the chicken bbq - with shoestring fries, Max & cheese, veggies, and bottomless corn bread (the BEST I've ever had). Everything was SO good - I honestly will be raving about this place to all my friends and family. My husband too will be, he is picky and absolutely loved the food.

They actually use cheese in their mac and cheese instead of using a roux. If it wasnt I couldnt tell because it tastes so good.   Not to even mention about the great service here. They explain their cooking process. They always check on you. I purchased a beer I tried for the first time and didnt like it. The server allowed an exchange for a fimiliar beer.

The food was delicious - brisket and baby back ribs were my two favorites. I was a little surprised at the size of the sides - smaller than I would've expected for the prices they charged but they, too, were delicious. Across the table we ordered a couple of 'whole hog' platters, burgers, wings, house salads and 3 desserts. We all left very happy and stuffed!  The highlight of our meal, however, was our server Travis. You can often tell when a server first approaches your table what kind of service you'll receive throughout your meal - and he did not disappoint. He was kind, efficient and personable. Serving a family like mine is not easy but he did it with ease. I highly recommend you ask to be seated in his section when you arrive for your meal.   The front of house staff was also great (bussers, hosts) which tells me that the training at Bobby Q's is top notch. It's hard to find a restaurant that has checked off all the boxes - great service and great food - but they do it. Don't hesitate to go here!!",

I order the three meat platter and I absolutely loved the brisket! It just fell apart, hard to find. Even my daughters cheese pizza was tasty and a nice size portion. Lastly the little fresh donuts they give you at the end melt in your mouth!! The service was really good, many people walk around checking on you. Definitely will be coming back",

The restaurant is much more franchise-y than I expected but it still has homey roots.  We ordered the three meat plate of St. Louis ribs, baby back ribs, and beef brisket with pecan coleslaw and baked potato. The meat is incredibly, incredibly tender. It ended being too soft for my preference but if you enjoy fall off the bone BBQ this is the place for you. The sides are delicious and go well with the food. We found the BBQ sauce way too sweet for our tastes. Service is fast and everyone working is very friendly. The little touch that was lovely are the cinnamon sugar donuts you get at the end of your meal. A nice treat to top off a pretty decadent meal.  I enjoyed the restaurant overall although it didn't fit my personal preferences. It's a fun place to check out when you're in Phoenix!",

This gem was located right across the 17 freeway from our hotel in Phoenix  Saw this places' sign from the freeway and it looked intriguing. Not much on sweet style bbq sauce or brisket because I'm biased  (Raised on Eastern North Carolina style chopped pork) but this place was off the hook!  Walked in the door and told there was a 1 hour wait so we decided to wait. Found a spot at the bar so we decided against waiting and ordered our food from there. We started off with these apps they call Q-Rolls and they claim they're \"World famous\". Well, they deserve that title as far as I'm concerned. Bbq brisket rolled in pastry shells like taquitos with chipotle and bbq sauce for dipping. Mercy!!  For my entree, I had the St. Louis and baby back ribs with roasted corn and tater salad. The meat was super tender and falling off the bone. The waiter offered to bring  me more sauce but it was super delicious just the way it was. Not a big fan of tater salad but this was great so I'm a fan of theirs.   My wife had the fried catfish and same sides as me and she was well satisfied, She really don't like Bbq but she liked the taste of mine a lot.  DERN!!! I forgot to mention the cornbread! This is what bbq should be served with. Last, we finished up with the bread pudding. My wife said this was the best she ever had so that's saying something, Bread pudding is her favorite dessert and she never likes anybodys but her own.  This place was not completely laid back with paper towels and checkered table cloths but they weren't over-the-top fancy either. To me, a great place to drink a beer and bust the buttons on your britches.",

I miss the salad bar and the food of yesterday!! If you have been around the area for a while, you know what I mean. If not, you missed out BIG TIME!! Bobby Q took Bobby McGee's out and I'm still depressed about it over a decade later!! Bobby Q, you do not impress me much.  Like many others, I do not understand the hype or the love of this place at all, whatsoever, NOPE, not now and I never will!!! Their meat is \"moist\" alright, to the point of no texture and you could feed it to a TOOTHLESS infant!!! I like some texture and a lot more smoke flavor!!!  I especially do NOT like the donuts they serve after your dinner. They are greasy and mush much like their meat. My young kid said they made his \"stomach sick.\" Their cornbread is good, but I make mine from a boxed pre-mix and add a can of creamed corn and a small can of drained green chili's (only the 3 ingredients) and I like it BETTER!!   I give them two stars only because for lunch they have a good deal. You can get a brisket or pork sandwich with a side for $9.00. The atmosphere is nice and the service is good so I might return for lunch, but not very often and ONLY if I happen to be driving right by. I will NOT go out of my way to eat here!!!",

With all the choices and sides, it has something for all lovers of BBQ.   My favorite starter is the Q-Rolls; but who could resist a crispy eggroll stuff with their delicious and tender smoked brisket. And usually we order the Whole Hog Heaven, which really is a feast for everyone eating it. You get to pick two ribs, two meats, and three sides. You cannot go wrong with anything you chose. I usually get the baby back ribs, St. Louis ribs, smoked sliced beef brisket, and smoked pulled pork with a side of sweet potato fries, pecan cole slaw, and mac & cheese.   What I recommend: -- Q-Rolls -- Whole Hog Heaven -- smoked sliced beef brisket -- baby back ribs",

But, as we pull up and I see the sign it literally is called \"Bobby Q\" I got gonged!\" hahahahaha and apologized!   This is the first place that I really enjoyed having some delicous BBQ style dishes. I've had before in Mesa at another place and that was great too because we ate it as family style. But, this is probably one of my favorite places in the valley of having some good ole' BBQ dishes with the macaroni cheese, yummy corn bread, baked bbq beans, coleslaw and their delicious sweet tea, which is something that I haven't really had before but, all was amazing. I love as we were coming up to the restaurant you can almost smell the slow roasting smell through your car which gets you excited and more hungry as you park. I love the barn look and the atmosphere and everyone in here is so nice! You really feel like you are in another state and the food it's so picture perfect that my family/friends back home their mouths are dropping because we don't have this back home an if we do, it is not the same. The q-rolls with the brisket is one of my favorite appetizers to get and I heard it's something new they just added to their menu. I've never was fond of brisket because it always tasted so dry, but, Bobby Q's its amazing. The brisket is so juicy, slow roasted for at least 18-24 hrs daily, and taste of the bbq on it is simply just delicious! All their meats are soon tasty, I don't need to go to one of those fine dining restaurants anymore, I just rather be comfortable and enjoy their combo dishes or the HOG HAVEN and bring home the left overs to salivate later for next days lunch or dinner....  They also have these amazing donuts with cinnamon on it, to me it almost could pass for \"Malasada's\" its a portugese delicatessen desert dish...Same concept! Was soon ono! Happy place- Amazing food, customer service, and ambiance!",

    "text": "Went Sunday night with the bf, and we shared a huge combo of prime rib and bbq chicken with baked potato and 2 sides. We opted for a 2nd baked potato and pecan cole slaw. We ordered hot tea, and it's the cute little boxes of Revolution tea, in various flavors -golden chamomile, ginger peach, tropical green, and earl grey lavender is what we ended up with. Love all of them. I love prime rib, and this really hit the spot. The horseradish was not that spicy though. Still tasty (we get both) but I was hoping it had more of a kick.  The bbq chicken practically fell right off the bone. the bbq sauce is one of my favorites. Cole slaw was delicious as usual, but I didn't see any pecans.  Stefania was our server, and she was pleasant and attentive.  I like how versatile the table and booths are. They can easily be arranged to accommodate various sized groups, and just the fact that you can control how close you are to the table is always a plus in my book. I've been to other restaurants where it feels like you're a mile away from the table if you want back support. So it's great that this is not an issue.  I really want to try their oatmeal cookie martini, and some of the desserts were tempting, but I don't know if I'll ever have room to try!  A fun place to go for a celebration, a date, or family dinner.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. My husband has been wanting to go for a while, and we finally went tonight.  Let's start with the positives (I'll apologize in advance for jumping around). We ordered the calamari appetizer ($12.50); we both enjoyed it. Hubby had the three meat combo dinner ($26) with pulled pork, beef ribs, and chicken. It came with 2 sides, he chose baked potato & beans. He liked it all and the few bites he shared, I liked too. I ordered the 10 oz prime rib dinner($26). It came with 2 sides. I wanted a side salad, so I got one side and $3 up charge for the salad (which she told me up front & I was fine with). The blue cheese dressing is great. Some of the lettuce was brown though, so that was a little off-putting. The prime was just so-so & I would not order it again.   Now for the rest of the not-so-great part of our dining experience. It is rare that hubby and I get to go out alone together these days, so we were really looking forward to having a nice dinner out. Our server was a little over-zealous at first. It was our first time there so we were taking our time going over the menu. We ordered the calamari appetizer and asked for a few more minutes, again. She brought 4 warm pieces of cornbread to the table. She comes back a couple minutes later & this is where one thing that really bothered me, happens. I have my little plate in front of me and as I'm about to put a piece of cornbread on it, she takes it, puts it on a dirty plate from someone else's table - as I was saying, \"oh, I was still using that\", and she says, \"oh here, you can have it back\" and set it back down in front of me! I said, \"no, you can take it\". She didn't even offer to bring me another one. Now, I've been a server before & even when I was inexperienced, I would have NEVER done any of that. Very unprofessional.   When we placed our order (this was right before the plate incident) things came out in timely fashion, but then it was almost like she disappeared. I didn't like the mashed potatoes, something tasted a bit off - like they used milk that wasn't good or something. It wasn't until I was about finished with my prime that she came back to check on us. I asked for a baked potato instead, and she was back in a flash with one.   So overall, hubby was satisfied with his food. Me, not so much. Service, lacking. And, for probably the worst part of it all...about half hour into dinner the lounge area starts playing heavy club music. Not only is it competing with the country they have playing in the restaurant, but you can feel & hear the bass so much that it literally made us feel so irritated that we decided to take the rest of our food home. It was not a good dining experience for us. We probably won't be going back.",

An unsliced tender and flavorful piece of meat. The two servers, one a trainee, seemed to be tripping over each other. One dropped a big steak by my arm, then placed a new knife FACING me. Uurrrr, excuse me, that's not right. Our comfy booth at the edge of the room was near a congregating place for servers, distracting to us diners. Doesn't mgmt notice this. Young lady mgr asked about our experience, but her cool brusque manner said she wasn't really interested. For the two of us, a hefty $68 lunch, granted it was a lot of food and was very good! Just loved the complimentary cinnamon twists which is why we came in there in the first place!  Will pickup a couple of dozen for next breakfast potluck.",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner last night. It was our first time here, but we wanted to try a new place and after seeing the reviews (and how many reviews) we had to try it. We were both beyond impressed. There wasn't a wait since it was a Monday night, but I could see it being packed on a weekend.   We ordered the Q Rolls appetizer and each got a cocktail. My boyfriend said his tasted a little weak but overall they were both very tasty and mine was not weak. I had the Peach Tea and I can't recall what his was. The Q Rolls appetizer was absolutely amazing. I can't recommend that enough.  For the entree, we decided to go with Whole Hog Heaven because we had no idea how huge it was. We got baby back ribs, beef ribs, rotisserie chicken, beef brisket, mashed potatoes, mac n' cheese, and shoestring fries.   Right after we ordered, two pieces of cornbread came out with a side of butter. This was SO delicious. Shortly after, our meal came out. Let me say again how HUGE this was. I tried to pick up a piece of brisket with a fork and it was so tender I couldn't pick up the whole piece at once. I specifically wanted the baby back ribs originally as they're my favorite and they were easily the best I've ever had. Meaty and tender with an amazing taste. I suggest asking for some extra BBQ sauce for the table but the meats are delicious with or without it.   There was so much extra that we both have enough for lunch and probably even dinner tonight. I'll be eating lunch soon and can't wait!   They brought out a piece of ice cream cake for my birthday (vanilla ice cream with chocolate cake and a walnut fudge icing). Delicious but I was too stuffed to eat more than a few bites of it.   After we paid, they brought us a little bag of these mini cinnamon sugar donuts which I tried this morning with breakfast. Very tasty especially considering they were next-day donuts.   The service was great throughout the whole meal. Unfortunately I forgot the server's name but she was quick and attentive. Needless to say, we were very pleased and can't wait to go back.",

The side dishes were all exceptional and ending the meal with warm mini donuts was a great way to end the meal. We do not live near Bobby Qs but this meal is worth the drive and we can't wait to return.",

The hostess was very nice (Paloma) and quick with getting us situated and fed. The food was good, not what I expected for the price though.     Both mine and my boyfriends meals were a bit on the bland side not having much flavor. We had to put salt and pepper on everything, the Mac n cheese tasted like the Velveeta box kind and the \"grilled veggies\" were not grilled and were just blah, however their cornbread was DELISH! and melted in your mouth! Sooooo good! Now the catfish and ribs my boyfriend ordered were VERY TASTY and the ribs literally fell off the bone! But the steak I ordered was just ok, I had a better one at Red Lobster?!   If we get food from here again I'll probably just stick to the ribs next time.",

Our family of 5 (all adults) ordered 1 hog heaven ($44) which included 2 ribs (we chose St. Louis and baby back),  2 meats (chose sausage and brisket), 3 sides (chose veggies, corn, and fries), and corn bread.  Pros: - great service. Drinks were refilled before we even came close to running out and food was served within 10 minutes of ordering. The manager also came by to see how we liked it. - open decently late (10 PM) - Meat was FANTASTIC. Fall off the bone tender; no knife needed. - Sauce on the meats were delicious. The perfect degree of sweet and not at all sour. - CORNBREAD. Best I've had. Good enough to be a dessert.  Cons: - the complimentary cinnamon doughnuts were an awesome touch at the end that I was really looking forward to; unfortunately ours came a bit stale. But because we were late diners (10 pm) and everything else was so great, I won't hold that against them.",

    "text": "Last night I joined 4 friends and brought my girlfriend to eat at this restaurant for the first time. Before we got to order, the server was placing our water cups in front of us. The next moment surprised my whole table because the waitress mishandled a water cup and all the water in one cup fell onto my girlfriend next to me. I was so caught off-guard that I didn't even realize that half of my dress shirt got caught in the splash zone too. My girlfriend was just wearing a one-layered sweater so she didn't really have an option to change. As a result, apologies were given and as the waitress handed us napkins, she smiled and told my girlfriend \"you still look good though.\" Everyone at the table had an easy-going personality, so we just shrugged off the situation. Thinking about what happened, I would not be surprised if someone else would go nuts about getting soaked before the appetizers came.   Now onto the actual food. To the recommendation of my friends who have been here a handful of times, I ordered the fried chicken with mac & cheese and thought it was a great dish. The breading had a great crunchy texture and every bite of the chicken was tender and moist. The biggest recommendation we had was to try the beef brisket, so my girlfriend got that. We both shared our plates with each other, and I thought the brisket had a great smoky flavor to it. The beef was so tender that you could easily slice through it with a fork. Although the mac & cheese tasted really good, I felt that it was a little too heavy for my own tastes. I can't complain about any of the other sides because they all tasted great and were seasoned well.   My girlfriend still liked the restaurant because the food was great and the decor/layout of the restaurant seemed nice. Having been to many barbecue restaurants dispersed throughout California, I thought the restaurant was fairly priced and the food was top-notch. By the time we got to our check, I asked my girlfriend if she was still wet, and she said \"yeah a little.\" It would've been nice if management stepped in and gave us a cookie to turn her frown upside down, but our waitress was probably too embarrassed to tell the manager anything. Would I come again? Probably, but I'm not sure when because I usually only eat out for special occasions or social gatherings.",

It still retains some of its vibe from when it was Bobby McGee's, just modern.   To be honest, this change in format was the best thing that happened to Bobby McGees, because it was starting to feel stuck in the 1970s.  Bobby Q's is just plain awesome.  I highly recommend them!

    "text": "Short version: The food is delicious and the service is wonderful! 5 stars.  Long version:   Ambiance: i was impressed with this restaurant as soon as we stepped in. It reminds me of the Lucille's BBQ chain in decor and ambiance - classy yet family friendly, with southern comfort and hospitality. Their menu even has a truck on the cover.  Service: Excellent. All of the waitstaff was attentive and courteous. Our waitress explained the history of the restaurant to us since we told her we were first time visitors.   When our party of three told her we were planning on splitting a whole rack of baby back ribs, we assumed we would get a large plate of whole ribs and then three plates. Instead, we got three separate plates portioned with 3 equal parts of ribs and the sides distributed evenly as well. Such an unexpected and very much appreciated gesture, considering that ribs are messy enough as it is!  Food: AMAZING!   Sweet Tea ($2): Refreshing and sweet, but not in excess.  Corn Bread (free): The only thing served that I didn't enjoy. If you like dense, oily cornbread \"patties\", this might be your thing.  Cajun Shrimp ($11): The shrimp is marinated in cajun seasonings and beer and it is accompanied by garlic bread. The slightly alcoholic flavor paired well with the shrimp and cajun spices and the garlic bread was buttery, crispy, and not overwhelmingly flavored.  Baby Back Ribs ($26): The best bbq I've ever had in my life! To be fair, I'm not a huge bbq connoisseur, but the ribs are succulent, tender, flavorful and the bbq sauce adds a tangy flavor. The meat falls clean off the bone.  Shoestring fries (comes with ribs): They are extra skinny and salted to perfection - my favorite type of fries. Scrumptious.  Mac & cheese (comes with ribs): Creamy, cheddary with a delicious consistency. The BEST kind of mac and cheese to accompany a rack of ribs.  Thank Q Donuts: When you leave, they give you fresh, warm cinnamon donuts - and a lot too! They gave us 6 for our party of 3. An awesome touch.  This will be my new go-to bbq joint from now on :)  Tip: If you check in with yelp or foursquare and tell your waitress, they will give you 10% off your entire check. Be sure to tell the waiter before you ask for the check!",

    "text": "Bobby Q has a rustic, Western vibe with a music selection customary of a traditional BBQ joint. The play on words for the restaurant's title was what caught my attention but I came into Bobby Q with my sister and boyfriend since we were craving some good BBQ.   We ordered the Cajun Shrimp appetizer to start. The shrimp is sauteed in beer; this was the standout factor for me in this dish because I could actually taste the flavor of the beer, which complemented nicely with the Cajun seasoning and butter.   We ordered the Full Baby Back Rib BBQ Platter to split 3 ways. You can choose from a list of sides such as mac and cheese, shoestring fries, ranch beans, mashed potatoes and pecan cole slaw. We decided to get mac and cheese and shoe string fries. I was expecting to be given additional plates to pick off the rib platter but our waitress was kind enough to have the kitchen split the dish on 3 separate plates, with a portion of mac and cheese and shoe string fries on each plate. Right when I started cutting my ribs, the meat fell cleanly off the bone. The 22 hour smoking process yields amazing results because the meat was moist, tender and just plain heavenly! The BBQ sauce was tangier than most but was delicious. My sister even loved the ribs and she's not a huge meat person.   Lastly, what made the experience worthy of the 5 star rating was the service. The service was PHENOMENAL! Our waitress, Kessa, was informative on the restaurant's history (they used to be Bobby McGee's!) and their smoking process (the meat is smoked for up to 22 hours). In addition, the manager/restaurant owner personally came up to our table to see how we were enjoying our food. Our waitress was also sweet enough to bring us a half dozen complementary cinnamon donuts to end our meal!",

Thank you yelp for showing me to this awesome gem during my short stay at Phoenix.   Came in on Monday of Memorial Day weekend right when it opened so there was no line. PHEW. I guess it makes the experience much better when you don't have to wait in line right? Got seated quickly and the service was great! Our waiter (I wish I remember his name) answered all our questions and even gave us a little history of the restaurant as it was our first time there. Anyways, lets get to talking about the good stuff...THE FOOD.   To be honest, I was already in love with this place when the complimentary corn bread came out. Free is one thing, but these corn bread were so moist and good! Between me and my friend, we ordered the whole hog heaven because we eat a lot and we were starving. We got the pulled pork, brisket, beef ribs, baby back ribs with a side of cole slaw, corn, and mac & cheese. The hog heaven only come with two sides, but you can pay about $2.00 for an extra side...worth.   All the meat was delicious, although I wish the pulled pork and brisket had more sauce on them. My favorite is the pulled pork! Super easy to eat and literally melts in your mouth. The baby back ribs were good, but I feel like there wasn't enough meat and the meat didn't come off as easily as I hoped. The mac & cheese was BOMB, but my favorite was the corn.   We also ordered a strawberry lemonade and that was delicious was well, and went really well with our food.   And to end our wonderful experience, there was also complimentary donuts?! Sorry, but complimentary corn bread AND donuts? Can there be a place like this in LA please? Haha.",

I had read a lot of great reviews about this place and since my soon-to-be hubby is a self-proclaimed BBQ connoisseur, I decided to take him here as a spontaneous mid-week treat.  It's a pretty neat location.. They definitely  nailed down-home, country vibe that they were going for.   I wouldn't say the food was sub par by any means, but it didn't knock our socks off like the authentic, southern eats we're accustomed to. Sweet tea was off, mild BBQ sauce was WAY to sweet. Meat was okay, but nothing amazing. Service was decent. Mac n cheese was money.   My guess is that the people who typically  eat here haven't lived in the South where this type of food is an absolute art form.  This location isn't particularly close to where we live so probably won't be back anytime soon but we are curious to try out Little Miss next!",

I watched other tables that had been seated after us by 20 mins receive their food long before ours ever came out.

I figured another server had taken our plates. or Our ticket had been lost.  The place was mobbed so I do expect some inaccuracy.  The manager did come over and asked \"How is everything tasting\"  and before we could empty our mouths to speak I put my thumb up and she did an about face and left.  It took 2 hours to get a table and food and less than 10 mins to eat.  We told the server the manager didn't even give us time to respond.  The manager came out and offered us dessert at no cost.  In the end our  entire meal was on the house.  I didn't expect that but they obviously wanted us back.    I'm sure we will give it another try because the food was exceptional..Although the grilled veggies were too greasy and over cooked.",

    "text": "I got the tasting platter (or whatever it's called for $13) and chose the Pork, Ribs and Brisket with a side of pecan slaw.  I didn't expect a feast, and wasn't disappointed. the portions were what one would expect from a tasting platter: 4 or so small ribs, several forkfuls of pulled pork and 3-4 pieces of brisket. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the slaw. That thing had me pleasantly chowing down for more time than any of the meats I chose.   How was the meat: the pulled pork was EXCELLENT. It was tender, juicy, and had just the right amount of BBQ sauce. The brisket was a bit on the lean side, but had enough help from the great house BBQ sauce to push that one through. When you got brisket that had a bit more fat to it, it would just melt in your mouth (that's the way brisket should be!). The ribs (St. Louis-style) were as good as everyone on here hypes them: the meat can be pulled off the bone with little to no effort. I don't recall how smokey the ribs were, but I liked them regardless and noted that the house wasn't trying to use rib-meat as a thinly-veiled vehicle for BBQ. The ribs were lightly sauced, and the strength of the preparation was, in no way, not masked by said sauce.  For dessert, my table order a 1/2 order of the banana pudding, and a full order of the mud-pie. We *loved* the banana pudding (it's more like a banana custard atop a pecan-crumb crust), but couldn't find it in ourselves to enjoy the mud-pie. Our waitress was gracious enough to take the pie back and bring us a full order of banana pudding! What a gal!  Simply put: if I'm back in/around Phoenix and am craving BBQ, I will not hesitate to come back here and get either a pulled pork sandwich or a full rack of ribs.",

The interior has a bit more of an upscale vibe to it, not like an old traditional bbq place. The service was good and they give you mini-doughnuts at the end.  We ordered the whole hog platter to share amongst the two of us and it was definitely enough food. I don't think it'd be enough food for three hungry people, but definitely two. We had the brisket, pulled pork, beef ribs and st louis ribs.  The mac & cheese was delicious. It was creamy, cheesy and amazing. Definitely worth getting. The garlic mash potatoes were also very good, but not as mouth watering as the mac & cheese. If I had to do it again I would just have the three sides as mac & cheese, it was that good.  All of the meat was tender - the meat feel right off the bone of the ribs and we could cut the brisket with our forks. It was delicious with the smoked flavour and sauce they put on. Unlike other places they do put some sauce on it, which is how I prefer it. It's not overpowering and drenched in sauce to prevent you from tasting the actual flavour of the meat though.  Price wise it was a little higher than other restaurants (Seems to be $18-25 per person) we had been to, however the quality of the food is well worth it. Unfortunately we were too full to try the dessert, but that's OK because there's nothing wrong with filling up with meaty goodness.",

For Avocado being the first descriptive word i was expecting a TON of avocado in this salad, I was soooo excited for all the avocado I would be consuming, unfortunately there were maybe 5 or 6 very very veryyy small pieces of avocado in the whole salad (trust me I searched that salad bowl over) not even a half of an avocado...so maybe just call t the Cobb salad and be done with it? The brisket was cold and salty. The ranch dressing was extremely watery.   HOWEVEr the little corn cakes they bring you in the beginning were HEAVEN and the fresh made donuts at the end will drop you to your knees they are so amazing!!!",

    "text": "Great BBQ dinner on our last day of Phoenix vacation. Great staff - Ashlynn explained history of restaurant, how ribs and brisket prepared, and choices of sauces. Had a \"Whole Hog Heaven\" - which for our family was baby backs, St Louis ribs, and double order of smoked beef brisket. Tried two sauces - regular and spicy, which came to us in two small carafes for pouring. Sides included corn bread, roasted corn and ranch beans. Everything was tasty and we had left overs for part of lunch the next day. Ended with a death by chocolate dessert - which was two pieces of cake and a huge dollop of cream. Staff came by to replace empty drinks and refill water. A little dark inside so we were afraid to see what BBQ sauce stains were on our shirts when we left, but overall, a great place to dine.",

I particularly liked the dinning room atmosphere. Barbecue should be simply and delicious, and that's what you'll find here.",

The baby back ribs were melt-in-your-mouth good, the pulled pork and brisket to die for, the grilled corn sweet and buttery.  It is now our new favorite BBQ restaurant.

I'm not from the South but I know when great food is great, and this place is good, but not great. The St. Louis ribs are better than the baby backs, which are a little too sweet. The mac and cheese was nothing to write home about -- it almost tasted from the box, but not as orange in color. Two friends who had the beef brisket said it was OK but too mushy. I got the peach cobbler, which was mediocre (and seemed like it had been microwaved hot). It's a far way to go for OK bbq, in my opinion.   Most of us at the meal thought this place was fairly expensive as BBQ joints go. It was $17 for a two-meat sampler, and apps were about $7-8.",

My husband and I ordered a full baby back with grilled veggies and shoestring fries on the side to split.  My son ordered the chicken tenders with shoestring fries on the side.  The food was amazing.  Our ribs were very tender and fell off the bone.  The sauce was not overly sweet which was also a plus.  The veggies were grilled well and not too overly cooked.  The shoestring fries had enough crunch and saltiness.  My son I'm sure enjoyed his food because he ate the leftover chicken tenders for dinner, and he doesn't normally eat leftovers.  Our drinks were never empty.  The server was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed - extra sauce, drinks, etc...  The bathrooms were clean which is always a plus.  The only thing is that I wished they had sweet potato fries on the menu too.  Their fries were good, but love sweet potato fries with my ribs.  Great food, great service, ample parking, clean bathrooms.  Definitely will return.",

At some point he must have relayed this to the manager (it really was not a big deal at all!!) who walked over and comped our entire meal. In turn we left a huge tip to the server because he worked hard and deserved it. Thank you to the female manager that was on duty tonight, you went above and beyond the call of duty. Your kindness was uncalled for and you really went the extra mile to take care of us. It really was not necessary but still very much appreciated.!! This is the kind of positive experience you never forget. We will continue to visit!",

    "text": "When your first thought when writing a review is to acknowledge that you're craving for a fix... of whatever you're reviewing, it would definitely serve others well to give that place a try.  My wife and I were ecstatic to find a highly rated BBQ joint in the Phoenix area and decided to embark on a meat-laden adventure (get your head out of the gutter). As we drove closer and closer, we were a little hesitant about the area. Please forgive me for sounding like a snooty Scottsdale-dwelling yuppie.   However, we could not have been more pleasantly surprised as we edged into the parking lot to discover a very lovely atmosphere. The lit patio and friendly service made Bobby Q a big winner in our book, but the True testament in regards to whether or not this would be an oft-visited establishment or a distant memory of a trek into questionable territory, both geographically and culinarily.  We were both very pleased with the baby back ribs. The ribs were tender, moist, and were almost  the fall-off-the-bone variety. The cornbread was fantastic. Honestly, I'm going to have to stop writing so that I can stop salivating.  Recommendation: If you are searching for a great BBQ joint in Phoenix, want a great atmosphere (try the patio when the weather is nice!), need great service, and most of all want to tear into some juicy meat, give Bobby Q a try!",

    "text": "This might be my longest review ever. You don't have to read it, but you probably should.   How this place has over 700 reviews to begin with is beyond me. Not even Amy's Baking Company has that many reviews and, as you might know, was heavily trolled after it aired on Kitchen Nightmares. They must be handing out money to folks for writing this shit. Or they're planted reviews. What's even more baffling is that it has a solid 4 stars. Methinks something is not quite right, but whatevs. Let's move on, shall we?  This place is truly bizarre. I've been here maybe a total of 3-4 times since it first opened many years ago. It's a BBQ restaurant / club-lounge thingy. And as I learned for the first time at happy hour yesterday, it's apparently two different restaurants. At least, that's how everyone acted. My boss had made reservations for us in the Q Lounge for their Friday happy hour. Apparently you can just walk in (provided you're 21) and eat a buffet spread for free. But not until you get past the LAUNDRY LIST of dress code rules. Yes, a restaurant that serves BBQ, near Ghettrocenter, has a fucking idiotic dress code. Seriously some of the dumbest shit I have ever seen. I thought I was in metro Phoenix at a BBQ restaurant, not a Scottsdale nightclub. The list includes asinine things such as: No white t-shirts, no hats, no sunglasses, no sandals, and must be a cougar. I wanted to be like, mo' fucker, do you know this is PHOENIX? We wear sunglasses upon walking up. We wear hats to shade our faces from the blazing sun. We wear sandals, often times fashionable ones, so our feet don't get all sweaty. And white t-shirts? Now you're just acting foolish. Of course, my boyfriend whom I invited, was wearing a white t-shirt, with a nice button-up collared dress shirt (it was unbuttoned), a hat (a nice one, like derby style), and sunglasses because um, to shield your eyes? He was asked to button up his shirt, remove his sunglasses (no shit Sherlock, don't we all once we get inside?), and remove his hat. Mind you, he's a nice dresser, not some hobo with tattered clothes (usually). Had I not been invited by my boss to this happy hour, I would've bounced right then and there. It all just seemed like some giant, corny joke.  Time for a paragraph break. It helps your eyeballs if you break things up. I'd like to point out that the actual restaurant portion does not honor said happy hour. That's right, you must go to the 21+ side with the fun dress code rules to have happy hour, even though it gets insanely crowded with nowhere to sit. Oh wait, you CAN order a happy hour beverage, but you have to get up from the table and walk your ass to the bar. If you order a beverage at your table, it'll be full price.  I will now talk about the redeeming qualities which merited that killer 2-star review. The food is very good. The mac and cheese is the cheesiest, and all of the meat is incredibly tender. A wee bit overpriced, but not awful. They also give you free freshly-made donuts when you leave instead of a damn dinner mint. That's pretty dope. The staff is very kind. Our sever, Alicia (sp?), was very sweet and accommodating. Kudos to her.  Lastly, it's confusing as shit to get into this place. The parking lot is weird, and if you've never been, you'll have no idea where to enter. The Q Lounge vs the restaurant portion. Two different places, remember. Even though...it's...not.  Note: Just don't dress like you live in Phoenix. You might not get inside to the dopest dance club in all of metro Phoenix.",

    "text": "Like most people who grew up here I have driven by this place a thousand time, and gone in a few. Bobby Q's has always been known for its bar. The night life, has always been it calling card; now that has changed.   Last night I took my wife there for an anniversary dinner we started off with a few drinks. Bar staff were friendly and attentive. My wife had the Chocolate martini, that's a desert before dinner.  We had reservations at 7:30, and we were seated at 7:32. The place was packed, so when you go, get a reservation. We started with Cajun shrimp, good serving, and it was a short wait for the appetizer. Good quality corn bread was brought out with our appetizer. We really wanted to try the prime rib. I researched, and found that Bobby Q's has been voted the best, and they are right. Prime rib was tender, and you almost don't need a knife. The flavor was outstanding. I like a lot of people like horseradish, and they have the creamy type, and fresh ground, and it is fresh. When you bit in, and feel the heat in your nostrils.. That is fresh. The other side were as good, and the pecan coleslaw was outstanding! One person I talked to about Bobby Q's said it was a bit pricey, but the quantity and quality of food you get is worth it. Our server (I wish I remembered her name) was great. She was there when you want her, and not when you don't. Desert was apple cobbler, tart apples, crunchy crusts, and good vanilla ice cream; Granny would be proud.  The only one thing that was not to my taste, and this is not the fault of the restaurant is the noise.. A lot of people drinking, eating, and talk tends to do that, but the swap of that food for a little noise, it's worth it..  If you haven't tried this place yet, you're missing it. All you people like me who remember Bobby \"s for the bar scene; well its different now.",

    "text": "In an effort to cure our weekend blues - the hubby devised a new plan.  Instead of staring @ each other all weekend we alternate weekends and plan something for us to do.  Budget of $100.   No complaining!     This was his weekend.  I'm one of those wives that loves a surprise/hates a surprise.  With that in mind I had great anxiety over the adventure ahead of me.  We start off with major construction going on our off ramp.  So we got a little side tracked and wound up going through some stranger parts of Phoenix.  I couldn't imagine a restaurant here so I was really starting to wonder what he had planned.  Then all of a sudden closer to the freeway there it is.  The most glorious signage I had ever seen.  Bobby Q's.  Fantastic.  He's gonna feed me and then the night will really begin.   We head into the restaurant and everything is so cute.  It helped so much that tonight we could finally WANT to eat outdoors if we wanted to.  It's so much cooler.  We were told that it would be about five minutes.  We turned around, sat down and then our names were called.  Not bad.  I immediately notice the comfy little love seats and some of the tables.  We were not lucky enough to grab one of them but next time I tell you, my butt will be in one of them, or outside.  Tiffany came over and explained everything.  Which was great.  I love when wait staff knows their shit.  As a diet coke fanatic I will gladly let it pass that the competition is served in their restaurant.  I oped for the peach iced tea and had four more glasses after that.  At $1.75 how can you beat that.  And its not artificial tasting at all.  This was good.  Hubby had a beer that was specifically made for the restaurant.  BBQ Amber.  Good.  Went well with the meat.  Tiffany (who in my opinion is the epitome of what a wait person should be) immediately brought us some corn bread (to hold us over) and it was so good.  So GOOD.  I frosted mine like a mini cake with that butter and was all over it.  YUM.  When we put our drink order in we put an order for the Q-rolls in.  Before I was done with my first glass of iced tea - the appy was out. Think a smaller version of a taquito with beef brisket inside.  So awesome.  Good, just good!  I ordered the three meat combo (go big or go home) chicken, brisket and baby back ribs.  Chose mashed potatoes and corn as my sides.  Done and done.  Pic to follow.  I picked up a rib and it looked like the flintstone quarry.  Clean.  Not a lick of meat on it.  Where was the meat?  Oh on my plate.  It slid right off.  Not a touch of fat anywhere on it.  Melted on my mouth and was so good I was having trouble sharing.  The brisket was phenomenal.  The chicken with a touch of the spicy bbq sauce was run out on to the freeway and play good.  DELISH!  Do you get what I'm telling you here?  Hubby's meal was just as good.  Mac and cheese was great.  The corn.  O EM GEE the corn.  The little corn coins.  So cute and so damn good.  More peach iced tea.  At some point hubby used the term \"meat mayonaisse\" to describe the ribs.   He says that the fat on the ribs (which was minimal) melted in his mouth.    The manager came over to check on us and what a doll she is.  I'm so mad that we didn't get her name.  Dear Manager - thank you again for the delish meal, the unexpected treat after and the great time we had on our date.  We will bring everyone we know there, we will suggest to everyone that they go there.  It was a real treat.    To summarize - great place, great drinks, great service, great food, great manager, great dessert.  It will be our go to restaurant.",

This is the best brisket I've ever had. Fork tender, juicy and delicious. The Mac and cheese was incredible with a hint of burned cheese in the top and super super creamy cheesey goodness inside. Garlic mashed had just the right amount of garlic. Pulled pork was also tender and delicious. Extra bbq sauce served in small pitchers in the table- spicy and regular. Our server was also excellent- quick, thorough, and professional. All in all a delicious meal and my out of town lunch guests even went back for dinner!! Delish corn bread too!! AND...we got a little bag of cinnamon sugar donuts to take with! Thanks, will def be back again and again.",

This place from the time you step in lets you know that this is a True barbecue place. Between the atmosphere which just sets the mark for a very nice place and the smell from when you walk in. Took a friend here, I ordered the barbecue brisket and my mistake was I should of ordered it with sauce just flooding out of the sandwich. My friend ordered the ribs which were so tender that the meat easily came off clean from the bone. I loved how they put sugar on the rims of the glasses for the lemonade. The staff was very friendly and explained that everything is handmade and the meat is cooked for 20 ours before coming out. You haven't had real barbecue until you have come to Bobby Q's.",

    "text": "Solid four-star restaurant but not five. The beef brisket was the most flavorful brisket I've had in my entire life; A penetrating yet not overpowering smoky sensation.  However, I was disappointed with two of the three the barbecue sauces.  The \"regular sauce\" is sweeter than catch-up with just a little more sophistication.  The spicy sauce tasted more like corn syrup mixed with hot sauce.  However the Carolina sauce was a genuine flavorful masterpiece.  It's commonplace for vegetables in barbecue joints to be lackluster, but a four and one half star 800+ review restaurant should be an exception to the rule: it was not. On the more delectable side, we had the Apple cobbler for dessert -nine out of 10.",

My dear friend (71 yr old) Millie lives in Phoenix (AZ) and is home bound ---her bday is tomorrow 9/21. She has been craving BQ from this restaurant all summer long! I called this restaurant (from Ashland, OR) and begged if they could please deliver food to Millie. This restaurnt only delivers for large catering job.  Not only did this place deliver her food----they gave her BQ ribs, brisket, baked potato (all the fixings), baked beans, their famous mac & cheese, cinnamon donuts, banana cream pie with a pink candle ---FOR FREE!  I also happen to mention that Millie did not even have milk in her house --- so they delivered her big cups of milk.  The delivery person's name was Jason (coincidence---just like her adoring son) and he so kindly made her a plate of food and put the rest of the food in her refrig. He even texted me a  picture so I could see my dear dear friend, Millie. I am touched by the kindness of strangers----KUDOS and heart blessings to The Managers - Joe, Rennie, Jason, the amazing chefs, and the owners of BobbyQ's Restaurant in Phoenix----THANK YOU ALL ---- !  This is truly a random act of kindness!    Please---If you are ever are in Phoenix - try this place ---- tell them Millie sent you!  Eat savory BQ in honor of a woman that can no longer walk.    <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bobbyq.net&s=769728dea6d9952e78c8ccbf1beb93eb324ebfaadd7b94608bd12b047b26b0a0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bobbyq.net</a>  THANK U---I can't stop crying---you made her birthday so special !!!!

I wish things could have gone differently tonight, but the way everything was handled was truly professional.  We ordered our food and the bus person was clearing out our table. Well, he accidentally dropped the plates and sauce basically exploded everywhere under the table. My legs were drenched in sauce and my sister's new pair of shoes were stained. My sister had to run to the bathroom to see if they were ruined.  The bus person was very apologetic and so was our server about the incident.  The restaurant manager came up to us after my sister returned and she was also very apologetic. She offered to replace the shoes, she comped my sister's dinner and even threw in free desert. She even got my sister's food replaced because she was waiting in the restroom trying to clean up while her food was getting cold.   Food was great, the manager really knew how to take care of the customers. I know we'll absolutely be back!   Try the Q-rolls!",

    "text": "Beyond impressed! We've wanted to try Bobby Q's for years, ever since we saw it reviewed and featured on Check, Please! Arizona (local PBS station show where Arizonians share and review each other's favorite restaurants). We were in Glendale For Glendale Glitters, and as I always do, I searched Yelp for restaurant options nearby with a lot of reviews, and high reviews. Bobby Q's was just 5 miles away in Phoenix, so the stars finally aligned!   The restaurant was busy, as expected on a Saturday night, so we opted to try the outdoor seating in lieu of the 20-minute wait for an indoor table. The hostess assured us that it should be comfortable when she saw our hesitation, that there were plenty of heaters to keep us warm (hey, 45 degrees in AZ is cold!), and it was perfect.   Victoria, our server, was welcoming and helpful, my mom, husband and I ordered our drinks and meals, the sangria was good, as was the corn bread. We ordered the Q Rolls, and it took longer than expected to recieve them; however, they were delivered with an apology for the tardiness, an explanation that our ticket went missing (they were crazy busy), and we were told they were on the house for the delay. We all looked at each other and said wow, great service! By the way, I will dream about those Q rolls, wrapped in crispy spring roll-like shells was the best, and most tender, beef brisket I've ever tasted -- the juices ran down my hand while eating.   We found ourselves ordering drink refills, and people watching while we fell into a conversation lull, before we realized it'd been a while since we had finished our appetizer. The food was delayed due to previous ticket issue, but was so incredibly good. My mom and I each ordered the stuffed potatoes with pork, mine with veggies on the side, which I was impressed were cooked kabob style on a grill (too many restaurants treat vegetable sides as a boring after thought), we also ordered a side of sauteed mushroom and onions that I nearly wanted to swim in because they were so flavorful! The ribs my husband ordered were tender, and their spicy barbecue sauce was a great pairing. He said the Mac and cheese was \"so good,\" as was the roasted corn he ordered, and the pecan coleslaw my mom ordered. Our eyes all lit up with the first bite, and I said, \"we're definitely finding reasons to come back here\" (we live an hour away).   Donny, the manager stopped by and apologized for the delay, and offered to buy us desert. We are so impressed by the level of customer service we just received! Not enough businesses take care of their customers like this anymore. The food was so good that we would have gone back regardless, but the positive, and proactive, customer service we received drive me to write this review, and want to tell my friends and family about this place.   I've tried and cooked a lot of barbecue, we have a Texas sized semi-professional smoker at home, my family is Southern, and I grew up on North Carolina barbecue, this is THE FIRST time I've ever eaten barbecue outside of NC (most certainly in AZ) that I can rave about, and that I will make a point to seek out again.   My only disappointment was the Q-Lina sauce -- I understand barbecue is regional, and as personal and touchy as religion and politics to some, but the traditional NC barbecue I grew up with didn't involve tomato/ketchup/sugar based sauces. This is in no way a deal breaker, as I loved their traditional and spicy barbecue sauces for the sweet tomato concoctions they were, and will stick to those in future visits.   Thanks to Donny and Victoria for taking care of us as first timers, so glad we have left overs to look forward to, and can't wait to return!",

The service I received over the phone and when I picked up my order was superb. Justin went above and beyond. The food was excellent. The baby back ribs were falling apart tender and had a great flavor. The smokiness isn't overpowering and we enjoyed that. The pulled pork was some of the best we had. The chicken was wonderful and we really enjoyed the hot link sausage. All the sides were delicious as well as the cornbread. Dessert was very good also. Overall, we felt it was an excellent value for the quality of food and service. Thanks for not disappointing, Bobby Q!",

    "text": "Took the family (2 adults, kids:2,3, & 6). Ordered the big sample platter $35 i think, and it was enough for all of us. 2 different kinds of ribs, 2 different kinds of beef, and slow roasted chicken plus 3 different sides. The food was great. You could argue that other places make a single type of BBQ better but as a whole sample of BBQ, it doesn't get better than this. The portions of the side dishes could be bigger. We got there before 6pm and had no wait... once we left though, there were lot's of people waiting.  Their bar was rockin'. They have happy hour 'till 6p. Apparently this is the spot for drinks after work. Lot's of hot looking women. I will definitely be back, either with the family or with friends for the bar.  After reading the bad reviews I noticed a trend... they were written mostly by out-of-towner's that compare this place to joints in St. Louis and such. If you're some kind of a BBQ snob, of course you've had better... get over it. The BBQ is better than you're going to get at most full service restaurants that happen to have BBQ on the menu. As for those that complained about occasional bad service... have you seen the wait for a table after 6pm? Obviously they're doing something right. People have bad days sometimes.",

    "text": "There's Famous BBQ, and there are Pit's along with several other places coworkers and the like have dragged me to. Let's face it, when it comes to BBQ everyone has a different take, and I don't like the overly sweet, globs of sauce thrown on at the last minute, in spite of claims it been smoked for hours. I'm not that big on loud country music and I don't want to go to a Ho- Down. I'm hungry; I want real ribs with meat on the bone. Good portions, albeit, I'll order the full rack of St Louis style ribs next time. The Rib's here do fall off the bone; they have a sultry smoky flavor. Corn Bread that is probably the best you can get and Beans, we'll I might work on those, but I come for the Ribs. Bobby Q is easy to see with its big sign visible from I-17, but might not be the easiest to find the first time, once you drive into the private parking area, I feel better. Safer, it's good to read there is security, but I haven't noticed them. Then again, I go for dinner. This is the only Rib place that makes my mouth water; the Rib's are deeply smoked and taste like someone cared because they have a passion for RIbs. The service has been just right, every time I've been there, and not too long waiting for the check. I don't mind spending time in a restaurant, but when the plate is clean I like to go. My wife can have her BBQ Chicken, but I'm there for the Ribs. Other places, I'll think about and might eat, but these are the only Ribs in Phoenix that I won't say no to or have reservations about.",

I was surprised that the atmosphere was as fancy as it was (think dim lighting and cloth napkins).  Don't be scared it's not really a fancy place and the food is still very affordable.   The service was stellar.  Honestly, I had forgotten what good service was like after moving to Arizona, and then I came here and was shocked.  The waiter was friendly and the manager came out and talked to us for a long time and even brought us some mac and cheese on the house!  Good service always equals a returning customer with me and I was impressed that they took the time to make you feel welcomed and happy.  The mac and cheese was outstanding.  It was rich and creamy and the cheese had just enough flavor YUM!  The shoestring fries were also very tasty.  The meats here are very delicious.  They are slow cooked and tender as can be. The barbeque itself was pretty good.  It is kind of a tangy sweet flavor that wasn't the best barbeque I've had, but still pretty tasty. If you drive past this spot on the highway make sure you stop in and pick up some delicious food!",

I'm probably last to know that this place doubles as a night club.  A latin room and a hip hop club...it was amazing. I didn't get to eat dinner there so I can't speak for the BBQ but as far as the nightlife atmosphere in this area it gets 4 stars! Get there before 10, or the cover is $10 but still that isn't bad.  They have just about every spirit there, and even using the premium well is no more than 7 bucks. Will be going back real soon!!!

    "text": "So, the bf and I are in Phoenix for the weekend and looking for a good steakhouse.  All I'm able to find is a Lone Star, Black Angus, and Outback Steakhouse.  Boo.  I notice the Bobby Q off the I-17 and look it up on Yelp.  Pretty good reviews, and they serve steak!  So off we go.  What we ordered: Strawberry Qlada & Mudslide on the Rocks Q-Rolls Wedge Salad Ribeye Steak (with cole slaw and potato salad) Prime Rib with Shrimp Chimichurri (with roasted corn and ranch beans)  My Strawberry Qlada was delicious (I like the coconut on the rim of the glass), but the mudslide was missing an ingredient (easily fixed).  The Q-Rolls weren't anything spectacular, but they did taste good.  We shared the wedge salad, which they split it for us and I was thankful!  It was enough as a starter, and it was also very good.    The ribeye was amazing!  When it arrived, the bf asked for steak sauce, but after taking a bite of the steak, he decided that the steak sauce was not necessary.  It was so juicy and flavorful, I was a little disappointed I didn't order it for myself.  However, my prime rib was also juicy (not as thick a cut as Lawry's, but pretty good anyway!) and the shrimp was also nice addition.  The sides were all very good, but I loved my roasted corn the best!    I realized there were two things missing from our dinners after we left the restaurant.  The ribeye should have come with cornbread and the prime rib should have come with a jumbo baked potato.  I don't think I could have eaten the potato, but I would have liked to have tasted that cornbread.  Our server, Smitty, was EXCELLENT.  He was friendly and attentive, and he made sure we were well taken care of.  He definitely made our overall dining experience a positive one.  We'll definitely come back again.",

The service was good, and the donuts at the end were good, the slaw wasn't bad either. The rest of it was bad to terrible, the cornbread came out and it was mush, I couldn't pick it up and eat it, it fell apart in my hands.  I thought what ever, the meat should be good.  The main course came out, the exact same way, light brown clumps of mush, the brisket fell into little pieces and needed to be put in to a sandwich to be eaten. The pulled pork had very little taste. Next the ribs, the meat fell of the bones, a mushy mess, I had to eat them with a fork, because it was impossible to pick up a rib bone. I  only ate as much as I needed to feel not hungry,which was less than half. I had to eat the sides just because it was solid food. I will never go back there again, And considering the other complaints of  'mushy meat \"  on here  this wasn't a fluke, I felt I had to add to it. Total waste of money.",

They dont need to because the meat is that good but most sauces are bad and you would actually want them to drence the meat with there sauce. Its hard to find great meat with great sauce. The mac n cheese was the best. good bread.

Next, the PPS's (PULLED PORK SAMMY) we ordered came out hot, fresh, and ready. The meat was thicc but tender at the same time. I have never been so content with a PPS. Best in the valley. I tried some of Mary's mashed potatoes and I had an immediate verbal reaction: \"Flavor\". Then, to our surprise, Colton offered us even more cornbread. Of course, we accepted. AND THEN, Colton brought out the COMPLIMENTARY BAG of cinny sugar donuts (free of charge)! Colton was the best server in the west: treated us right, big smiles, and plenty of BBQ and fun. In conclusion, Mary and I thought that Bobby Q was so far the highlight of senior year.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to try this place after looking for somewhere to have lunch on a Saturday afternoon. What a great decision that was!   The restaurant is located on 27th avenue near I-17 and off of Northern. It is tucked away in the neighborhood, but don't let that fool you. Once inside, you will be treated to some of the best food you have ever had.  Our server, Jessica, was awesome! She was funny, helpful, courteous, attentive, and laughed at my stupid jokes (definitely a plus). The service there is outstanding, and makes the experience there that much better...if it's possible.  The menu is stacked with food that will make your mouth water. We are told that they cook all of their meats on-site for at least 20 hours. My wife had the beef brisket with corn and mashed potatoes. I had the smokehouse burger with mac and cheese as my side. Both were cooked to perfection and melted in our mouths. Be warned, the portions are big. Come hungry or be prepared to take many to-go boxes with you home, as we did. But that did not stop us from having dessert. My wife had the Death By Chocolate and I had the Banana creme pie. Both were so good that we were depressed when we were done eating them. When they bring you the check, they give you a couple of little doughnuts as a after dinner treat. Excellent!  The price is very reasonable for the quality of the food you will be eating. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu, and this time come with empty bellies!",

    "text": "Anytime is a good time for barbecue. The smell of burning wood, the sweet thick or vinegary sauces and meat that just fall off the bone -- these elements have mass appeal to my senses.  So it's probably no surprise that I've been to most Valley smokehouses to check out their goods.  My latest exploration, Bobby-Q, came after a day of bargain hunting at a clearance outlet at Metrocenter. So much shopping can work up an appetite, and you'll need an appetite since the prices at Bobby-Q are low and the portions are large.  The location might be familiar to many longtime Phoenicians -- it was Bobby McGee's until about five years ago. I have many fond memories eating there with my family as a kid.  While the building got a $3 million dollar makeover, the charm and coziness is intact. It's sort of a cowboy chic with dim lighting, stained concrete floors and a tin ceiling. The seating is comfortable and the service friendly and efficient. If you're in a hurry, you can call ahead; there is a separate entrance for to-go orders.  Everything on the menu is made in house, from the barbecue sauce to the fluffy corn bread. Being an avid home cook I can appreciate these extra steps.  Always wanting to try something new, the Q-Rolls ($7.50) are a take on a Mexican flauta. Filled and rolled with smoked beef brisket and then deep-fried to a golden brown, these looked better than they tasted. The roll's open ends allowed for far too much oil to penetrate the meaty interior, which ended up a tasteless crunch.  A steakhouse classic, the Wedge Salad ($5), is made with a quarter of crisp head lettuce, sprinkled with smoked bacon, chopped tomatoes and bleu cheese crumbles. I can never resist the power of blue cheese and bacon.  The menu includes entree-sized salads, sandwiches and steaks, but my focus was on smoked meats. You can order two or three meat platters, but I opted for the Whole Hog ($36), a choice of two ribs, two meats and three sides.  When the plate arrived, my eyes widened. Huge slabs of Baby Back Ribs and St. Louis-Style Ribs were framed by piles of pulled pork and beef brisket, it's quite the mother lode of meat, so be prepared to share with others.  Going straight to the ribs, I grabbed a bone and it immediately separated from the rib meat. The meat was melt-in-your -mouth tender, and rightly so; they cook their meats low and slow for about 20 hours.  With all of the meat loving going on, it's easy to forget the sides. The Mac 'n Cheese was creamy and gooey and was worth ordering again. Pecan Cole Slaw was good, but I especially liked the toasted pecans, hich provided a nice contrast. Roasted Corn comes topped with a few wheels of corn on the cob. I wish the entire dish were served this way, since the kernels were swimming in a pool of butter.  After finishing this feast, there couldn't possibly be room for Peach Cobbler ($6.50) or Mud Pie ($6.50). But it was a nice touch that the check was brought out with a small bag of hot fresh cinnamon and sugar-covered donuts.",

From the first bite it tasted weird.  I had maybe three bites and the texture was so disturbing I could not eat any more.  Diarrhea  for the rest of the day, sure I was poisoned.  Husband had sausage; he loves BBQ, but not sure what he was served.  Crossed both our minds we were served food like the did in Chain Saw Massacre. Taste was horrible.  He didn't finish his either and had a stomach pains. Sticking with Dillion's from now on.  This place cannot compare.",

It is a beautiful restaurant inside I must say.   I should've known I was in trouble when I asked the waitress if they had burnt ends and she had no idea what that was. I ordered ribs and brisket. The brisket was ALOT of fat, not what I was expecting. The meat with the brisket was good, just not enough of it. The ribs I'm sorry to say were not memorable. Sides were pretty good.   I also ordered an appetizer. It came out after my entree arrived. They were kind enough to not charge me for the appetizer because of this. I have to say service was good but I don't think I will return.",

Our experience was that the decor, menu, service, and presentation were all great, however the BBQ was tasteless. We ordered the Whole Hog to share. It included two types of ribs and two meats. The meats were all beautifully prepared, fall-off-the-bone tender, looked great, and then very little taste except for the sweet sauce on everything.  Maybe we are BBQ-spoiled living in Texas.",

    "text": "Oh man, Yelp did not disappoint me during a weekend trip to the Phoenix area with this place. First of all, they warm you up with free cornbread whilst you decide on what kind of grilled flesh you'd like to consume; it's served with a side of butter but TOTALLY not needed...the cornbread is warm, soft, and buttery as it is.   On to the main stuff - promove if there's just two of you dining would be the Whole Hog Heaven deal for $38: pick from two meats off of a list of four (the ladyfriend and I picked the beef brisket and sausage), two rib selections out of three (we rolled with the beef ribs and St. Louis-style), and three sides from their list (went with grilled veggies, mac and cheese, and shoestring fries). The brisket had that wonderful, beefy flavor - tender and moist on this particular occasion. Sausage was sausage; nothing spectacular. The beef ribs were good; they were decently sized and definitely meaty. However, we enjoyed the St. Louis-style ribs; these too weren't the pinnacle of ribdom, but these were also tender and delicious. As for the sides: grilled veggies - good, wish we had more; shoestring fries - they were fries; mac and cheese - too cheesy.  Why five stars? Great service, great deal for the amount of food we got, and, as many have noted, WARM DONUTS BEFORE YOU LEAVE. We didn't know about that part until we passed on dessert and received the check. If you feed me a good meal for a good price and give me a fresh treat at the end...well, you're a winner in my book.",

    "text": "I went to Bobby Q's for a family birthday on Saturday. The food was amazing and the service was excellent as well. I had the 2 meat entree bbq and spare ribs with Mac n chz and mashed potatoes. The meat fell off the bone. My friend doesn't eat pork and she agreed it was delicious! She had fried chicken along with others at the table who all raved about how delicious it was. The birthday boy received a double chocolate dessert and we all had freshly made donuts. They were both delicious. I give this place 5 stars. I wish I could remember the waiters name to give him kudos because you don't receive excellent service as he gave us these days. We showed our appreciation with extra gratuity. Thank you for a nice experience.",

Ribs were great, meat falling off the bone.  I thought the brisket was a bit dry; wife thought it was moist and delicious.  Go figure...  The chicken was  chicken, not much to say about it. I gotta say though, the cornbread was spectacular - I could've eaten a whole basket.  I normally don't say much about service, but this place is on top of its game. Happy staff were popping out of the woodworks asking if we're satisfied or need anything else.  Check-ins were frequent but not  annoying.  Atmosphere is nice too. It was busy on a Friday night so make a reservation.",

Then my girlfriend and I sat there for over an hour waiting for our food and watched all the people around us who came after us get their food, finish eating and leave before we had even gotten our food... We started to get pretty annoyed and upset but then once our food FINALLY came out the Manager (I'm assuming) (Johnny I believe was his name) brought out our food and told us everything was on him because of the wait and the cooks had somehow lost our ticket and they apologized. So we thanked him and started eating thinking our food was gonna be covered and we were gonna still pay for our drinks. When we finished eating they brought us a box to take our food and thanked us for coming with no bill at all so they completely covered our whole bill. So we thanked our waitress left her a tip and left actually satisfied even though we were there much longer than we had hoped. The food tasted great the ribs and the mac and cheese and the cornbread and the apps were all great. The cocktails were strong but tasted good. I would definitely recommend this place and \"Johnny\" managed to turn my 1 star review to a 5.",

My bf and I weren't sure what we wanted for an appetizer, so Chelsea recommended Q-pops. They were mouth watering beef brisket taquito type appetizers with BBQ sauce and chipotle sauce. The Mister ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich with Grilled Veggies and I got my Catfish Poboy with Potato Salad. Everything was so delicious!!! They also give you cornbread, which tasted sweet. I cannot wait to come back and try out the rest of the menu!",

I love the place, it's so woody and it really brings the southern feel. Highly recommended appetizers are the Crispy Sweet Onion Block and Q-rolls. As for the entree, all the ribs available in their menu and smoked prime rib top my list. Sides are equally tasty too - mac and cheese, shoestring fries, roasted corn and pecan coleslaw. The complimentary corn bread and baked potato (only comes if you order winning combination) are also superb.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite BBQ joints in Phoenix. Whether inside in the dining room or outside on the lush patio surrounded by an impressive garden array of color, Bobby Q is a great place to relax and gnaw on a few bones with friends or family.   It's expanded from this original location just off the I-17 and 28 Ave, with spots in Mesa and near central Phoenix/Scottsdale.   Between my ambitious belly and generous friends at meet ups, there's little I haven't tried on the menu. Here, despite the availability of burnt ends and lean or fatter options, the brisket doesn't quite make my favorite list. It's dry, even with additional sauce, and often my mouth registers char. It's got the perfect pink smoke ring that indicates properly cooked brisket. It isn't bad, really. Just not my favorite.   Pulled pork is better, whether on a sandwich or piled high on a platter. It's reliable but not quite as sweet and homey as the pork at Pork on a Fork or even the chain Famous Dave's. Writing that makes me sad. I want Bobby Q to just step it up and get a bit messier before I crown it Piggy Queen.   Chicken is where this place takes me down south and leaves my face and fingers dirty and grinning. Smoked to silky perfection and then topped with the perfect amount of sauce, this is my guaranteed highlight whether I scarf down half the bird or get it pulled into juicy strands and chunks.   The menu includes a host of southern favorites and even a few steakhouse classics. Side options include all the classics like a creamy potato salad with egg and mustard,  BBQ baked beans with generous bits of meat and heat, slaw, roasted vegetables and more.   I've only managed to order one dessert here, a rich cheesecake with a caramel aroma that was brought out with four spoons for the table. That habit from well meaning servers gets my goat. If I wanted to share then I'd ask. Your bringing them out makes me look greedy. Quit that.   Of course, the best dessert at Bobby Q isn't even on the menu. I confess, it's my favorite treat there. Servers bring out tiny brown paper lunch bags filled with hot cinnamon sugar donuts, barely the size of a donut hole. Imagine them crispy and spicy then melting on your tongue and floating into your tummy. Bliss. My only complaint? Hoggy pals who can't stop themselves from grabbing extras before the bag makes its greasy way around the table.   One of the options I'm dying to try at Bobby Q is their Thanksgiving dinner to go. It includes a smoked turkey, a selection of holiday sides and easy instructions for a price you can't beat. Expect more catering options from them soon. Whether your group dines in house or takes the meal home, Bobby Q is sure to keep you saucy and content.",

Itb was just an off night for the cook, so we will return.",

We were seated right away and our server explained all their specials and drinks to us. She got our drinks started right away but there were so many people here this night that our appetizer came before our drinks. This was not a problem though, as our family was just enjoying hanging out together.   All of the meat was so delicious. Smokey, moist, and flavorful! Also that mac and cheese was delicious! Portions are huge so expect to take half your food home, we love left overs so this was not a problem for us. I will say after our entrees came out our server seemed to disappear and it was difficult to order dessert and get our check.   All in all this was a great place for some good BBQ, definitely come ravenous!",

    "text": "I'll say up front that, being a Texas BBQ fan (and resident), I was a bit skeptical of BBQ here in the desert, but I was here with a group from work, and they were footing the bill, so here we go.   First up at the table, following beverage service, were baskets of little round cornbread rolls, a little smaller than hockey pucks, but far more tasty. They were a little sweet, but not overwhelmingly so, baked to a golden brown, and great with the supplied whipped butter.   For the main course, I ordered a three meat plate with sliced brisket, ribs, and sausage, with a side of mac and cheese. Here's the rundown:  Brisket: This, alone with the other meats, had sauce already applied (I forgot to ask for it to be omitted), but it wasn't slathered with it. The meat was a tad bit dry, but it was what we call in Texas \"lean brisket\", so that was to be expected. It did, however, have good smoke and a pleasant flavor all around. It was also well seasoned, as were the other two meats. A good start to the meal!  Ribs: These were smallish, still \"assembled\", and looked quite nice. Upon digging in, they were a slight bit overcooked (definitely the \"falling off of the bone\" phase), but the meat was tender without being mushy, and it also had good smoke and flavor. There was also a quite nice meat to bone ratio.   Sausage: The weakest of a decent spread of meats, this was a medium grind that wasn't overly \"Eckrich-y\", had good smoke, but the flavor just didn't wow me.   Mac & cheese: A fairly standard offering, it did have a good, strong cheese flavor and creamy texture, but the pasta was overdone .   This was really a nice meal. After the main service, a few bags of little donuts, sprinkled with sugar, arrived at the table. They were hot, fresh, and VERY tasty. It would have been totally easy to just eat the whole bag, but I limited myself to three :). Definitely check this place out if you want some decently good BBQ in the Phoenix area.",

We were seated in the outdoor patio, perfect for the weather that night. The customer service was great and I have no complaints.   Our meal started with complimentary cornbread. I'm not sure if I was just too hungry or what, but that has gotta be the best cornbread I've ever had in my life. And I don't even like cornbread. For my entree, I got the Southern Fried Chicken with a side of mashed potatoes and mac & cheese. Yuuuum.   I will definitely be back here to try something that's actually barbecue. The prices are a bit high, but once in a while, I think this place is worth it.",

Drinks promptly refilled, making sure our selections were perfect. The appetizers were excellent. We had shrimp in a light BBQ butter, the corn bread muffins hot with warm honey butter, the fish sticks fresh with two dipping sauces and the tortillas and dips were also excellent. Everyone chose off the menu. I had the steak open face on garlic toast and a baked potato. Steak cooked to perfection and tender. I'll be the first to admit not a huge fan of smoked meat but this was good. At the end they have these little bags of tiny donuts that literally are hot and melt in your mouth.",

    "text": "I came here for dinner with my family the other night and we had a nice time. I would definitely recommend making a reservation because they get SO busy especially on weekend nights.   It is for sure likely going to be crowded and on the loud side, but it is a super fun environment. The restaurant is really big and it has a great Western theme.   We were seated pretty quickly with our reservation. It definitely took awhile for us to be greeted and to get our first round of drinks. Our server mentioned that the bartender was really behind so that it might take awhile for our drinks. I felt bad for the bartender and it seemed like they should have had another bartender helping. They had also run out of many of their gins because it was the end of the month, but I felt like that shouldn't be an issue. However, their cocktails were tasty.   Regardless, our server was super nice and friendly. She was very good and attentive in the beginning and then towards the end it was difficult to track her down for awhile. I think she had a really big party that she was taking care of.   For starters, we started off with the recommended Q-rolls stuffed with brisket and served with chipotle sauce. These were delicious! They were crispy, not oily, and the brisket inside was tender and flavorful.   For my entree, I got the fried chicken, with a baked potato and mac n'cheese. The fried chicken was very good--crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The baked potato was good--not overly oily. The mac n' cheese was very good too, but reminded me a lot of stouffer's mac n' cheese, which isn't a bad thing--just reminded me of it. The prime rib that I tasted was also very good--tender and flavorful.  The prices were fair.  Overall, really fun and casual ambience, good food, fair prices and decent service.",

    "text": "After the review (below) of my catered dinner from Bobby Q, I received this email:  I would like to apologize for your catering experience. We pride ourselves on our food and take negative reviews very serious. I've shared your review with the owner and the kitchen manager. I would like to invite you and your family in for dinner on us. We would like to prove to you the quality of our food. Just call me directly and make a reservation. Again, we apologize for your experience.  Jason Gilliland Restaurant Manager  I wasn't sure how I felt about accepting a free meal - that was really not a goal when I wrote the first review.  In fact, my first thought was why should I waste my time on doing this food again?  But - I was very impressed with Jason's email and decided to give it a shot. He wasn't asking me to change my review - he was aksing for a chance to prove how good they can be.  If it was terrible, he was running the risk of me updating with an even worse review.  My roommates and I all had the day off today, and around lunch time we were discussing food.  We were definitely in the mood for BBQ.  I called Jason, and he immediately set up our reservations for dinner tonight.  Complete breakdown on the experience -  The room was nice!  Actually, the place was MUCH nicer than I expected a BBQ place to be - but not so stuffy we felt underdressed. Our server was Ashleigh - she was 100% on point tonight!  From her brief rundown on what Bobby Q is and what to expect, to menu descriptions, keeping our water and iced tea full, checking back at perfect intervals and - my *wow* moment of service - when she dropped off the moist towelettes, the packages were pre-opened!  Sounds silly - but when you have BBQ greasy fingers, those packages can be a bitch! The food - holy mother of wow - this was the same place as the last review?  The food was made with the same recipes in the same kitchen??  The only thing that tipped me off was the cornbread - still over the top amazing! The three of us split the Cajun shrimp appetizer with garlic toast points.  While it did not have the level of kick I've come to expect from BBQ shrimp, the flavor was incredible.  Adding in the rosemary was a dash of genius, and the 6 shrimp were perfectly cooked.  This is a recipe I'd LOVE to have! Wedge salad - HUGE!  In addition to the iceberg, tomato, bacon and bleu cheese, there was bacon.  Not just the baon bits - but big chunks of Meat Candy.  The blue was one of the richest and creamiest I've tasted. For meats, we had brisket, rib eye, St. Louis style ribs and beef ribs.  Across the board, each was fantastic!  Just as the AKC is looking for the \"ideal\" of each dog - the meats we ate tonight could be held as the ideal against which all other meats were judged.  Each of the four was a perfect example of what that meat can become, when prepared perfectly! The cole slaw does have good flavor - and I adore the fine shred they use.  So now it's two thumbs up for flavor and texture.  The mac and cheese was incredibly rich and creamy.  The baked potatoes - well, they are well prepared baked potatoes.  Either they're done right or wrong - not a lot of middle ground - and these were right. I aldo enjoyed the featured beer - the Bobby Q Amber - which is brewed by Sonoran - so that was double local goodness. I'd love to be able to review the peach cobbler - but we had already given up and filled boxes with leftovers to be tomorrow's lunch.  None of us had room for another bite. Then Ashleigh brought the donuts.  Damn donuts!  Perfect, warm and soft, cinnamon sugar fried rings of perfect!  I knew I was full.  I knew I shouldn't eat anything more.  And I am so lucky she only brought one for each of us...otherwise I'd still be there eating more and more and more of them! Fantastic dinner - all of us were incredibly happy from beginning to end with the entire experience. Thank you Jason - if you wouldn't have reached out, I never would have known what I was missing! We will definitely be back!",

My favorites here include the brisket, baked potato soup, prime rib sandwich (occasional lunch special), mac 'n cheese and mashed potatoes.  No, not all at once though.  :)  I love to get the soup and sandwich lunch special and actually put my brisket in the baked potato soup.  I also like to order the brisket sandwich with mac 'n cheese and do the same thing.  The cornbread they serve is delicious and makes a great appetizer.  My only disappointment here is that when I first started coming here you got fresh from the fryer cinnamon mini doughnuts at the end of your meal.  Now, they're never fresh and you only get them sometimes.",

    "text": "A bunch of friends and I tried this place for my husband's birthday the other day after I found it here on Yelp.  For the love of everything tasty, this place was the BEST barbeque place I have ever been to (aside from a place I loved that went out of business in San Diego).  After reading all the reviews about the appetizers and entrees, I pretty much already knew what I wanted to order before even sitting down at our table.    Our waiter, Lorenzo, couldn't have been better with his service and sense of humor.  The feel of the interior was a mix of casual and modern yet not too overly countryfied...there weren't dead animals hanging on the walls staring at me as I ate or hides either.  The group of us ordered the Onion Block for our appetizer.  I am not an onion person, but am a fan of the Bloomin' Onion at Outback.  But I can tell you right here and now that the Onion Block at BobbyQ's was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G-L-Y delicious!  It had the perfect crispy consistency, but what made it was the BBQ ketchup that it comes with.  I could have ate the sauce by itself.  The 6 of us ravaged it.    For our entree, my husband and I went for one of the winning combinations, particularly the BBQ chicken and prime rib.  We decided on the ranch beans and the Mac & Cheese (after the reviews) for our sides.  I went to ask for an order of corn bread (3 for $1.50) but Lorenzo told me that he would bring us a basket for all of us.  So, I am not sure if that is something that is included, kind of like chips and salsa at Mexican food joints.    The chicken was absolutely juicy and had the perfect amount of sauce and the prime rib was also juicy and melted in my mouth (we ordered it cooked Medium).  First, the Mac & Cheese was so very creamy and tasty that I had to stop myself from eating that and get back to the meat.  But the ranch beans tasted like so many others I have tasted, not bad though.  My friends and I, who also ordered the M&C, noticed a hint of jalapeno (not spicy, just the taste).  We asked Lorenzo and he told us they have two types of melted cheese in the kitchen, one being the cheese they usually use for the M&C and then this pepper jack/jalapeno cheese they use for other dishes.  He had said they must have accidentally used the wrong one and that it hadn't been the first time it happened.  This was so not a problem, b/c that jalapeno taste was actually what made it, I think.  I'll have to request it next time.    The desserts didn't impress me much, but I knew from the reviews, we'd be getting free donuts before we left.  I loved that touch!  Mark my words, we will be going back more than once.  I'm sure we will take our in-laws and my family to give them the chance to taste BobbyQ's deliciousness!!!!!",

    "text": "I dunno if this is THE BEST BBQ i've EVER had.... but it is definitely the best i've had in phoenix!   they offer this family special - the whole hog heaven, which is st louis style ribs, bbq pork, bbq beef brisket, and bbq chicken, plus 2 sides, for around $30, which feeds 2-3 people. so we ordered one of these, plus a 3 meat combo (2 orders of baby back ribs + more bbq beef brisket). oh my word. so much meat! tasty, glorious, juicy, succulent meat! i heartily recommend the st louis ribs over the baby backs, bc they were cooked SO tender and were so nice and meaty.   it was alllllllll good! and their spicy bbq sauce? love it! for sides, we tried the grilled corn, mashed potatoes, and shoestring fries. i'd say forget the fries, but definitely get some of that corn! and the cornbread.... well. it was pretty good, but i did expect better.   i saved some room for dessert, and we tried the apple griddle cake. it was like.... cooked apples on top of a custard-like crust. we were expecting it to be more of an apple pie type deal, so it was slightly disappointing. and it also wasn't awesome, but it was still good. i adore how they give you a cute little bag of hot, fresh donuts! they were delish, and still tasty the next morning.   a little deals heads up - if you go on sundays, the whole hog heaven meal is a bit cheaper. can't remember the exact numbers since i didn't pick up the tab, but it's a screamin' deal!",

    "text": "It's pretty clear from all the reviews, meat loving barbeque aficionados really like Bobby Q's.   This review is for my fellow vegetarians who for some reason end up here.   Why you say, would a vegetarian even end up here? Well, for one, to keep peace in the family, for the sides, and for my fave salad, a wedge of iceberg lettuce ( I can hear some of your groans, \"iceberg lettuce!\" \"What is she talking about\") with house made chunky blue cheese dressing.  This dressing is the best I've ever had -  I usually get a pint or so to take home. The grilled vegies are consistently good as are the baked potatoes and the corn bread.  The mac and cheese is rather average.  Prices are reasonable - portions on the large size.  The little donuts they send you home with are a nice/sweet way to end the meal - but not worth the calories.    The wait staff are fun, friendly, efficient - the camaraderie has a good feel to it.",

He was attentive and nice, True meaning of customer service! :) and within 10 minutes our meal was out! We ordered whole hog heaven and it filled four people, the meat was so tender, moist, and fell off the bones, BBQ sauce was delicious, Mac n cheese is absolutely rich and cheesy, and ending with donuts!

My most recent visit, I ordered the brisket sandwich with shoestring fries, and was quite satisfied.  Service was fast and friendly, and the food was excellent.  First up was the cornbread, which was very flavorful and full of buttery goodness.  The meat was tender, juicy, and went very well with the regular barbecue sauce.  The fries were also good - I couldn't figure out what was special about them, but whatever it is, it works.  Overall, a very good place, highly recommended.",

    "text": "ok....first let me say that I grew up in PHX. And we used to go for special occasions to \"Bobby MaGees\" which is where BobbyQ's is now located (says something about the quality of my restaurant experiences as a young fella)...And as cheesy as Bobby McGaees was...i kind of miss the pirate serving me my dinner (and the salad bar in the bathtub).  But i do like what they have done to the place. Cool interior. Casual but with a nice upscale feel. The patio seemed really nice (didn't sit out here).  We tried a variety of things. A burger, a pulled pork sandwich, brisket, baby backs etc...  I think the standout were the ribs. VERY good...very tender (but not overcooked), good sauce.  I enjoyed every one.Everything else was just ok. Like on par with Chili's (which isn't saying much).   The sides were pretty tasty. Corn (roasted and then taken off the cob for you) , mashed potatoes, cornbread...all pretty good.   Dinner for 4 (2 kids, no booze)...50$.  But a 5 star place? Maybe in the context of other restaurants in the Dunlap and I-17 areas (next to crazy Mitch's Furniture barn.) But not in the broader context of PHX.  I would definitely go back for ribs...but not a place that will go into the normal rotation.  Side note: Hilarious crowd on a Saturday night. Lots of \"west side\" clubbers...or maybe too old to be clubbers but want to go clubbing (there is a lounge attached).",

The only let down was the corn bread which was kinda dry. The special (forget the name) margarita was ok... not all the waitress chalked it up to be but she didn't look old enough to drink so maybe that was the issue there. Ill get the thing in the pineapple I see pictures of next time. Its a little tough to find, but with GPS it was not too bad. Service was really great, our waitress was on top of it. A manager even came and asked if there was anything he could do for us. We forgot at the end of the meal to show our yelp discount and they reversed our charges and added the discount, no problem. We will definitely make it a regular spot! Only thing I was a little confused about is there seems to maybe be a bar on the back of the restaurant? We looked for it but couldn't seem to find a way in...",

    "text": "I am beginning to think that the reason I love barbecue restaurants so much is the fact that I ALWAYS get two meals out of one visit.  That figures out, on average, to about 7-8 bucks a meal, and you can't really beat that for great food!  The husband and I decided to go here on Friday night, and the place was busy, but not so busy that we were able to be immediately seated.  Our service was fantastic.  I'm beginning to think that restaurants are recognizing our faces from our pictures because this was beyond good service.  Our server was super quick and very sweet.  Our food came out impossibly fast too.  The food was delicious.  I ordered the brisket platter, of course, and it was super yummy.  I got a big fat helping of tender brisket and two sides.  I chose the pecan cole slaw and the mac and cheese.  We also got cornbread with our meals.  The cornbread is really yummy, but strangely shaped into little disks.  The cole slaw was very good, with a great sweet flavor that was enhanced by the crunch of the pecans.  The mac and cheese was literally rib-stickin good.  It was the super thick and creamy kind that makes me weak in the knees.  The barbecue sauce served on the meat is fairly minimal, but they bring you plenty of extra so you don't have to worry.    I would definitely come back here.  I loved the food, the service and the atmosphere.  I would definitely recommend this for good sit down service BBQ.",

Anyway, we had just picked up a friend from the airport and were on our way home. He asked if there were any good bbq places here. Since we didn't know of any, we looked on yelp.  We got here very late, so they were about to close the kitchen. However, the lounge/club was about to open. They told us that it would be loud, once the club opened up. We didn't mind it and decided to stay.  We all ordered food and drinks. I ordered the full plate of bbq brisket, coleslaw and mashed potatoes. We also ordered some appetizers. Everything was great. I loved the corn bread so much that I asked for more. The Sangria was good too.  Everything is priced right and the portions are fair. Try it out; it's worth it.  By the way, we stayed at restaurant after the club opened. Let's just say it wasn't like the food. I would never come here for the lounge/club--food only. We're taking our friend back to the airport tonight, and we are going to have dinner here again. I hope to have a good experience again.",

    "text": "6 of us felt like bbq on Labor Day was an appropriate way to officially celebrate the end of our summer but didn't want to deal with the actual hassle of cooking.  Bobby Q hit the spot. We started with the hot wings--all drummettes--kind of standard hot wing fare.   We all shared the \"whole hog\" platter which consisted of 2 slabs of ribs and 2 different bbq meats. They ran out of baby back ribs (booooo...) so we got the St. Louis ribs and the beef brisket and sliced bbq pork.  All very good stuff. The meat was tender and flavorful. I particularly liked the brisket. The waitress said that the \"whole hog\" would feed 3-4 people so we ordered the fried catfish as well.  I guess she meant 3-4 HUGE people, because it fed 6 of us and we still had leftovers (4 guys and 2 girls). The catfish was also good, not overcooked. We shared 4 sides: mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, grilled veggies, and roasted corn. The sides were quite satisfying, but not outstanding.   We all ordered the fresh lemonade as a beverage--good but too sweet so I had ask for unsweetened ice tea to balance it out. Again, we were all too stuffed for dessert.   Miss C and I agreed that we would definitely come back and take advantage of their happy hour specials--1/2 off margaritas, doubles for the price of singles, and 1/2 off apps--Tues-Fri from 4-8 pm.",

While a coworker and I were waiting for the rest of our party, the probably-owner offered us drinks, and the waiter checked in with us a fair few times to make sure everything was good.

I ordered the 1) 8oz sirloin steak with 2) mac n cheese and 3) shoelace fries, along with a 4) frozen strawberry lemonade.   1) Ordered medium rare. Average steak. There was a vein of unchewable running through it that I had to spit out. It really is quite massive and is the only thing I wound up finishing or even putting a dent into.  2) Waaaay rich. Like eating a bowl of solid melting cheese. Not my thing, but maybe it is yours.  3) Fried breaded onions. Like onion rings, but also like eating oil.  4) Unbelievably, jaw-achingly sour. The waitstaff offered me another to replace it, which was just as sour, but it couldn't be helped.  Tl;dr: 5 star service, 3 star food.",

    "text": "Anyone that knows anything about BBQ and large chain restaurants knows that it is extremely hard to mass produce BBQ and still make it delicious. For this very reason I was skeptical about going to Bobby Q. Then I looked at the ratings and saw that the restaurant has a greater than 4 star rating. I HAD TO GIVE IT A SHOT!   I ordered the full rack of ribs and loaded baked potato with mac and cheese on the side. WHOA! I must say that Bobby Q thoroughly impressed me! The smokey taste and tenderness of the ribs was out of control. Not to mention, when I was done, I was full as a tick! I actually thought I was the one in the back of the restaurant Q'ing it up on the smoker. But after I woke up from my daydream, I realized that Bobby Q is or SHOULD BE a staple in the greater Phoenix area.   When I come back to Phoenix, this is definitely one of the restaurants that I will have to indulge in a repeat visit, just to make sure I wasn't in a dream of bliss and desire.   Bobby Q's... Phoenix is supposed to be well known for Mexican food and taco shops, well, my friends, you have made your mark, I will remember Bobby Q's for BBQ!",

This experience at Bobby Q was the best one that I have had at a restaurant in Phoenix, in years. Taylor, the manager was PHENOMENAL. The absolute, hands down, most personable, nice, friendly, and understanding manager we have ever met. He chatted with us, made sure that we had everything we needed, and then retrieved a box and checked back in on us when we were finished. Our server, Mara, was so sweet, on top of our needs, and super friendly. She told us all about the restaurant and her great experiences with the team. I couldn't have asked for a better dinner to have had on date night with my husband. Keep rocking Bobby Q! And thank you Mara and Taylor. You both were the absolute best!",

    "text": "The ambiance.....i cant say enough about the fantastic feel this place has. It has a rustic look with upscale charm. I sat on the patio and was nervous the noise of the expressway would annoy me. That exact opposite happened. The fountain with the trickling water and the ebb and flow of cars combined to make me feel peaceful and relaxed. The place is incredibly clean as well.   For the meal itself I ordered Q-rolls to start. These were like beef brisket meeting an egg roll.  It was served with a chipotle sauce and bbq sauce. It was easy to eat and very tasty. The crispy dough outer shell complimented the flavor in the beef.   For dinner i ordered the 2 choice option. Beef brisket, of course, and the baby back ribs because sever said they'd be one of the best i would ever had.   To be honest, i have had better beef brisket in Tennessee. By all means it was excellent but a tad dry compared to some of the juicy fatty brisket from those hillybilly towns off the  main roads. The server did not lie about the baby back ribs. My grandmother's ribs compete with these and that says a lot to the quality and taste. WOW!!!!!!  Wonderful!!!!!  I also ordered the ranch baked beans. Very flavorful. It has beef and pork in them. Some of the meat was stringy so texture was odd but flavor is great.   As for the service.....OUTSTANDING!!!!!  Hunter was my server and his knowledge of the menu and ability to give tips enhanced my experience. He was friendly and had just the right amount of chattiness. The manager, Cameron, was also extremely attentive. I felt like i was in the fine dining section of a cruise ship. They both teamed up to make sure everything was perfect throughout the night.   I look forward to returning here to try more of their fabulous menu items!!!!  Ps. They due brew their own beer. Tastes like a shiner bock with less after taste.",

    "text": "Been by this place for years on the 17, but never stopped in. My girlfriend went for lunch months ago, said it was good. We ended up being in the area, and decided to grab dinner here.   Building is very cool, like an entrance queue to a ride at Knotts Berry Farm. Dig it.   For a Wednesday night, this place is super busy, which is a good sign. Even better when I can get a table immediately because I don't care where I sit!   Being a KC native, I'm very skeptical of BBQ west of the Rockies. I haven't had anything to knock my socks of anywhere in the Southwest. The menu here is huge, which is also a drastic departure from any BBQ place I've ever been to. Prices are definitely on the higher side, too.   Ordered Q-Rolls to start, based on our server's recommendation, which were actually very good. Brisket wrapped in puff pastry, I could easily eat a manhole sized plate of these things. Awesome. I had the brisket platter. Brisket was good, definitely delivers, but not in my top 10 brisket adventures. With the excellent ranch beans and so-so mac and cheese, it was solid, but not worth $20, as portions are on the smaller side. Others at my table said the same about their ribs and chicken, too.   Spicy sauce was served in a stainless pitcher, and was very forgettable. Good BBQ sauce is tough to find anywhere (especially since most, even Gates as of late, are just HFCS infused sugar shit these days), but Bobby's sauce was neither spicy or tasty.   Beer is served in actual pint glasses (which I haven't seen in years), not the 12 oz. \"pint\" glasses we've all become accustomed to. Nice touch.   Service was OK. Food came out reasonably quick. Manager checked in with us 2-3 times, which seemed a bit odd, but nice to see that leadership is engaged at this place. Or maybe our server was in the doghouse, unclear!  We basically decided that, while we dug the building, the service was decent and the food was OK, there really isn't any reason to come back since the value isn't there.",

Everyone raved about the food.  The brisket was tender, well smoked and absolutely delicious.  The smoked salmon and chicken were outstanding.   The sides of potato salad, cole slaw, beans, smoked sausage were all on point.   I had read the Yelp reviews but sometimes with catering you never know if it will be as good as freshly served at the restaurant.   This exceeded my expectations.   Next to our own family recipes this is by far the best bbq I have had from a restaurant.  I would not think of ordering from any other bbq restaurant in the Phoenix area.  Thank you Bobby Q!",

Corn bread and the great donut holes at the end really topped of the meal.  Love the atmosphere, decor and the service was great.   I highly recommend and will be back.",

Everything was great from the complimentary corn bread to the complimentary FRESH BAKED donuts they give you as you leave. I ordered the baby back ribs and catfish plate. It came with a baked potato and I requested Mac and chew and grilled corn as my sides. I also had a bottomless frosted lemonade to drink.   I was so satisfied!!!  Mostly because I have plenty leftovers for dinner.",

    "text": "My friend Kate M. had mentioned that she had wanted to have lunch here sometime.  Today, the stars aligned and we (wife and son) drove down here to meet Kate and her husband for a late lunch.  This place has always piqued my interest, and honestly, I'm not sure why I never had lunch/dinner here before.  We drove down and met them at 2pm.  Kate and her husband were already there and grabbed us a table and high chair for our son Bill.  They had ordered Some Q-Rolls (basically an egg roll stuffed with smoked brisket) and some drinks already and offered me up a Q-Roll.  These things were good!  They serve them with chipotle and a bbq sauce.  I could definitely see myself eating a whole order of these things.    I had read some reviews of this place and it sounded like most people enjoyed the ribs.  Who doesn't like ribs?  I decided to go with the 2 Rib Combo (St. Louis and baby back) which came with 2 sides.  I chose ranch beans and french fries for my sides.  Had a Diet Pepsi to drink.  My wife ordered a brisket sandwich and some mac and cheese for her side.  Pretty much ordered the fries and mac and cheese for our son.  You will have to read Kates review about what she and her husband ordered ;-).  Before they bring out your food, they give you a basket of cornbread.  This stuff was great!  I ate 2 pieces of it and could have ate more.  Anyways....on to the main dishes.  Here is how everything was...............  Rib Combo-  Delicious!  These ribs were so tender they fell off the bone.  I know some BBQ purists will say that ribs should not fall off the bone, but I don't give a shit...these ribs were delicious!  I ate the baby backs first.  They were awesome!  They came covered in minimal sauce so the meat really stood out.  I dug straight in with my hands and would just pick pieces of meat off the bone and savor every bite.  They were delicious and I can see why so many people order them here.  After the baby backs, I got into the St. Louis style ribs.  These were not as good as the baby backs, but they were still pretty damn tasty.  They were cooked so well, that even up at the cartilage portion, there was minimal of it and you could pick through and get every single little morsel of meat.  All that was left on the plate was pretty much bones and a few pieces of cartilage.  These ribs were 5 star ribs!  Sides-  This is where I was a little let down.  I love, love, love some good beans.  I prefer some baked beans, lots of sauce, cooked well done so they are thick, and lots of scraps of meat throughout.  These beans had some meat in them, but they were \"ranch style\" beans and just alright....a little runny.  The sauce was good enough to hold them together, but I have had much better beans elsewhere and would not get these again.  The portion was skimp too!  It was like 5 spoonfuls worth.  The fries were really thin shoestring fries.  They were pretty good.  My son loved them...he loves pretty much any french fry.  They are his favorite food, by far!  The problem with really thin shoestring fries is that they tend to get hard/cold fast.  They were still pretty good though and I would get them as a side again.  Really big portion of them, too!  My wife gave me a piece of her brisket from her sandwich.  It was legit.  She thought that her brisket sandwich was a little bit too plain/boring though.  The side of mac and cheese was good.  Really cheesy, Velveeta type mac and cheese.  Decent portion size too.  Not sure why the beans were such a skimp portion.  Everything else was hooked up!  Oh yeah..when you are done with your meal they provide you with some free mini donuts.  A bit skimp (3 tiny donuts for 3 people), but free so I can't complain.  They tasted like a lemon pound cake, deep fried and then rolled in sugar.  I could mow down a dozen!  They were delicious!  I just wish they maybe gave you 3 per person...then we would be talking!  Service was great!  They had multiple people servicing our table throughout the whole meal and everyone was on point!  I think even the manager came by to ask how everything was.  Conversation was great, too.  It was the first time Kate and her husband met my wife and son.  A good time was had by all!  Will I be back?  Yes, at some point for sure.  The ribs were absolutely fantastic, and with the right choice of sides, this is a damn fine BBQ meal and a potential 5 star joint!  It wasn't the cheapest lunch ($63.00 after tax/tip), but for my first time here, the amount of food,  and the people I was with, it was worth it!   I'm sure I will be back before too long.",

Fish Fry Fridays during Lent (comes with Two sides for $10.99)! And don't forget to tell the waiter about the Yelp 10% off Discount! AND you don't even need to order dessert because they give you FREE Cinnamon and Sugar Donut Holes!  Unusual thing is that on Friday and Saturday nights there's another side of the bar that opens into a club. Does NOT affect the dining experience.  Our Cabbie told us it was SUPER GHETTO, we'd probably be mauled immediately upon entrance, and possibly beat up by thugs- not the case. Very safe.",

Worse,, it lacked character; for example the wedge salad was lacking blue cheese and tomato, leaving a chunk of uninteresting iceberg. Evidently, the management has come to the strange notion that throwing onion straws on things makes them worth eating.",

    "text": "Bobby Q's is probably one of the best places we ate when we were in the Phoenix area.  The only real downside was the location; it's a bit difficult to get to, but well worth the drive and the few minutes we were lost in traffic.  Our waiter started by asking if we'd ever been there before, and offered some suggestions to get us started.  He brought back cornbread for us (and didn't charge us), and we ordered the Q-rolls (which I highly recommend).  We drank the Pilsner option, which was delicious.  From reading prior reviews, the three of us decided to go with the brisket meals/sandwiches, which were delicious.  We also ordered the pecan coldslaw, which our waiter informed us (when he brought the meals) that it would be out in a few minutes.  Earlier, I had noticed a woman going table to table, speaking with many customers; she ended up checking in with us and introduced herself as the manager.  The coldslaw came out maybe a minute after our meals were served, so it really wasn't a big deal.    The meal was very delicious, and we were incredibly full from the large portions.  For the lateness of the coldslaw, we were offered a free desert.  We ordered a piece of mud pie and it was gigantic; it took all 3 of us to put this piece away.  And then, while we were waiting for our check, the manager came over with powdered donuts for us to take home, again apologizing for the coldslaw.  This place was amazing, the food was amazing, and the service was even better.  I  highly recommend this place to everyone.",

Just visiting Phoenix for a weekend, I turned to my boyfriend and said, \"We have to go there before we head back to LA.\" He was totally on board once I showed him the pics from Yelp. Banana Cake, Doughnuts, Meat. Yum!  We didn't even know until the day of that we would get a 10% discount for mentioning Yelp! Bobby Q rocks!  One Whole Hog Heaven and four refills of Arnold Palmer later, we were in Bobby Q Heaven. My God!!!  Check out the pic I uploaded with caption -- \"Feast your eyes on the Whole Hog Heaven\" Yup. That's my boyfriend, the most perfect man for taking me here, and buying me the best BBQ I've ever had, ever. Period.  Service was perfect. Adam was extremely attentive. Great personality. He even brought me a cole slaw sample because I was inquiring about it, but didn't end up ordering it! Needless to say, we were so impressed that we left a 50% tip. Seriously, Bobby Q and Adam are that good.  Vibe is perfect. Decor is amazing. Indoor/Outdoor seating. Food is fantabulous. Service is impeccable. Oh, the best - when you pull into the parking lot, before you even get out of your car, you can smell the smokey meat goodness. All of their meat is smoked/cooked for 24 hours before hitting your mouth. That means that all the meat is fall off the bone perfection.  And the extra bonus - the moistiest corn bread before your meal and the sweetest cinnamon sugar doughnuts after your meal. What more could you ask for?!  I want a Bobby Q location in Los Angeles. In fact, why not put one in every city? This stuff definitely needs to be shared.",

Man, did this place set the bar(bq) high for future BBQ spots.  I had the half slab of spicy bbq ribs with potato salad and mac and cheese. The amount of food that they brought out could have fed three of me- I can't imagine how much food they give you with the full slab. The ribs were incredibly tender and fell right off the bone. The SAUCE was amazingly delicious. I can't even describe it other than that it was so good that I wanted to order a pitcher of it and pour it over everything.   I am a total potato salad guy and this potato salad hit the spot. Perfect blend of ingredients. The Mac and Cheese was just otherworldy with the amount of delicious cheesey gooeyness that it was. All in all I think I gained 30 pounds just from eating half of the meal.  Even if you don't order a dessert, they end your meal with some homemade mini doughnuts (yeah I spelled it out)! It's a perfect treat even if you have to take them home to eat them. Heat them back up before you do.   I will definitely go back here next time I visit Phoenix.",

The St. Louis ribs were perfectly tender and delicious, and the meat easily came off the bone. The cornbread was great too--I heard some ladies at the table next to me saying they really wanted more, and I would have too if I hadn't already stuffed myself to the point where I couldn't eat another bite. Our server Joey was very attentive and quick and he and the manager came by multiple times to check in on us, bring us wipes even though we hadn't asked for them (but we would definitely need them later on), ask us how the food tasted, and thank us for coming. In the end, they gave us some free donuts in a bag (because honestly, I could not take another bite of food). Overall really great lunch--I can see why they were rated one of the top 30 BBQ places in the country on Open Table!",

    "text": "I was always hesitant to open my heart to this restaurant because (a) it has about the worst name they could have possibly chosen, and (b) it gets a lot of hype, but now that I work right across the street, I *have* to try it.  My first visit, I went with a tried-and-True classic, and something most people could probably agree is a barbecue bellwether: pork ribs.  Along with the ribs, I had their slightly disappointing lemonade (their beverage selection is quite weak for a barbecue place) and the beans on the side.  The beans were at an acceptable level of quality for a good barbecue place.  The ribs, however, shined.  Melt-in-your-mouth tender, these ribs were smoky and tasty, and the meat just falls off the bone.  You don't even need to pick these up; you can use your fork if you wish.  Of course, I couldn't issue a verdict on a place like this after just one visit.  I went back, and this time for the smokehouse burger cooked medium rare, with shoestring fries.  I don't usually order burgers at barbecue places, but I heard good things about this burger.  And boy, did it live up to expectations.  I am not usually a fan of barbecue sauce on my burgers, but this one really worked.  Part of it was the crispy onion straws, and part of it was the fact that the cook was very close to the mark on the meat temperature.  The meat wasn't particularly lean, so it is a burger you can probably order medium and still have plenty of moisture left.  The fries were also tasty, and were a perfect complement for this burger.  Now, one thing I am not a fan of is the ambiance.  It doesn't seem to have that rustic feel that you usually expect from a barbecue joint; this place seems just a tad too upscale, if that makes sense.  But I cannot deny that they make some great food here.  One could make the case that, despite their horrible moniker, Bobby Q serves up the best barbecue in the Phoenix area.",

Meat fell off the bone, the pork was tender and perfect, the brisket was tender and perfect too. The Mac-n-cheese was unreal and the ranch beans were spot on. For dessert we had the banana cream pie...ridiculously amazing!!! I'm glad I live 42 minutes away from Bobby Q because I would pack on the lbs for sure. If you want great BBQ, excellent service, and a restaurant with unique character Bobby Q is a no brainer.",

The service is the best you can ask for. They are quick,friendly and answer any question you have for them. The food comes out very quick which is great since the smell of the BBQ everywhere has you craving your meal. We got the hog heaven which a sample platter of all the BBQ they have. We picked the ribs,chicken and brisket. All of them were excellent. Our waiter Justin was awesome and he recommend the banana cream pie which was had Bobby Q's twist on it. It was very refreshing and the perfect end to a great meal. Will definitely come back here every time I'm in Phoenix.",

The BBQ sampler with ribs, brisket, and pulled pork with one side ran about $14. The ribs were definitely the standout of the meal. They came off the bone clean, were very tender, and had a nice smoky flavor. The pulled pork rivaled the ribs, and may have actually surpassed them in taste. The brisket was tender, but was lacking the flavor of the other two meats. It also seemed a little off in color as it was as it was much lighter than most I have had. Mac n' cheese was my choice of side and it was deliciously cheesy. I could devour bowl after bowl of that goodness. Also worth a mention is the donut they bring you after your meal. That thing, albeit small, was fresh out of the fryer, covered in sugary sweetness and an unexpectedly nice ending to a solid meal.",

They were crazy busy and had us seated with in 20 minutes.  We ordered some ribs which were awesome.  The mack n' cheese was some of the best I've ever had. The corn bread was was the high lite of this meal in my opinion, moist and full of flavor.   Service was top notch and I'm so glad our family got a chance to eat here while on vacation.

Being that it's location is right off the I-17 we'd pass Bobby Q's many times & often thought it was a dive due to its location. We were pleasantly surprised as we walked in & were greeted by two friendly hostesses & a nice ambiance. Both my son & I were dressed casually. I looked around and noticed some guests were dressed up, while others were casual like us. I immediately felt comfortable.  It was a busy Sunday about 7:30pm. I requested a booth as I wanted to enjoy mother/son conversation over a nice dinner. The restaurant's interior is a rustic western theme with a bar in the middle, dining patio in front & separate dancing lounge connected to the back.  Everything was very clean and orderly like a well oiled machine. Our server was professional, friendly and quick. My son ordered the hamburger with cheddar cheese from the regular menu which came with shoestring fries & I ordered the Rib Eye with roasted corn and mashed potatoes. Both of our meals were prepared according to our liking and tasted sensational! Prior to our entrees, the server brought out 2 warm pieces of round cornbread with butter. It was delicious! We wish we would have saved room for the banana cream pie, next time for sure!  Towards the end of our dinner the manager came to ask how our dining experience was, it's nice to know this business cares about their guests!  One side note, the complimentary mini donuts that are given with your bill are awesome.  I highly recommend this establishment  (Excellent Food, Service, Family Atmosphere or perfect Date Night) & we look forward to celebrating my upcoming birthday here!",

My hubby & I opted for the catfish po boy...(at a BBQ joint..go figure!) and that sucker was GOOD! I liked at the end of the meal they give you these wonderful little fresh donuts...Ahhh...be still my beating heart...When I go back to Phoenix, I'll be hitting up this place! One more thing... Location is a bit awkward. If You're headed to this restaurant & if it feels like you're lost.. You're not...it's in somewhat of a residential area.",

We eat lunch there once a week and sometimes on the weekend as well. The food is amazing and always fresh! I have to say that I have yet to eat something that I didn't like.   Appetizers:Must have the Q-Rolls or the Spinach and Artichoke Dip Sandwiches-Cant go wrong with the Brisket Fully loaded baked potato is amazing! Dinner-Filet Mignon or the Chicken Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes Sides-MAC AND CHEESE PEOPLE! Corn or the Ranch Beans.  I think I should work for this company as I am very passionate about what they serve and the customer service.  IF you are looking for night life try the club that opens up after the restaurant closes. They provide bottle service and will even do balloons for the tables that you reserve. They have the most amazing street tacos that are served around midnight!  I hope that someone is reading this review and heading there now! Don't forget to try the amazing mini-doughnuts that are made fresh and served to you complimentary.",

I am somewhat critical when it comes to BBQ, having spent 8 years working for a Knoxville based company and then 2 years working for a Dallas based company, it is hard to beat those areas for pulled pork, baby back ribs and brisket respectively.   I was pleased by most of what I ordered here at Bobby Q. The pulled pork was tasty, the sauce was agreeably flavorful, the baby backs were flavorful, although perhaps a little too tender, I did not have to pick them up to eat them, the meat fell off the bone. They were probably boiled to get this preparation, but they were yummy either way. The potato salad was exactly the kind I like in my BBQ joints. The mac and cheese side was just ok, not bad, but not the best thing on the plate.   Overall it was a good meal for  BBQ west of the Mississippi and I would go again if in the area. Service was attentive, and the place itself was quite a nice spot to eat. Recommended.",

Some of our friends just swallowed the whole meal. We had to go back the day after as we were in town for a softball tourney. I ordered the whole Hog it came with baby back ribs, pulled pork and bbq chicken. All were very tasty. Baby back ribs came right off the bone just the way I like it. They bring out a good portion for each so I had plenty of leftover my husband and I could not eat all of it. I kept the leftovers it in the refrigerator till it was time to go back home and brought it back home to (Cali), I was very happy. At the end, you get free donut holes! Best way to end a late lunch.   (2) SERVICE: I can't remember the servers name as we were a large group but they were all very nice  and answered our questions and  requests.  The only thing I did not like but I do understand since we were a big group over 25 peeps the gratitude was added on each individual check I had 3 checks and each was for one person a tip of $5.00 and some change so I think that was not very nice. However, it was worth it service and food was amazing. I totally recommend this place....  Maria",

Our first option closes in sundays, so we picked this place with no higher expectatives. I was completely wrong:  All the staff was friendly. They set up a table for us in a minute, the place gave me a good first impression. Since we have 3 kids (1,3 & 5 yo) we selected the typical brisket and susage with sides (grill veg, mac & cheese and potato with bacon) My wife and I shared the orders witht the kids. All the orders were served in less than 10 minutes.   Honestly I was expecting to pay close to $ 50, my suprise was that all this costs 31, I put down an extra tip for all the good service, food and the place itself.   I score 5 stars for this place.",

The whole restaurant was absolutely adorable and they had a gorgeous patio area. We went in for lunch so we didn't really get to try anything they specialized in. We both had pulled pork, & oh my gosh it was so good! And their steamed veggies were perfectly cooked. Our server was cute and very friendly. We were her last table I could tell (I'm a server myself) anyways she was still very attentive and polite didn't make us feel rushed at all. I'll definitely be back for dinner!",

    "text": "I was visiting my friend in Arizona this past May, and we were looking to get some barbecue. She had never been here, so we decided to check it out for lunch. We both ordered the platter sampler ($16) that came with a variety of items. I got the brisket, ribs, and pork with a side of fries while my friend got the sausage instead of the pork. The sausage was a little spicy and a tad on the drier side (still good though), but everything else was excellent. The ribs were especially good - the meat was tender and fell off the bone easily. At the end of your meal they give you free mini donuts which was cute. Interior is nice and spacious, there is outdoor seating, and service was great. According to my friend it was a little pricier, but I'm used to LA/NY prices, so I thought it was a deal considering I still had leftovers after eating my fill. If I were ever in the area again, I would definitely go.",

    "text": "Went to Bobby Q with a work colleague and fellow BBQ enthusiast. We ordered two 3-meat combo plates so that we could try almost everything.   All 3 ribs tasted good (baby back, st-louis, beef). I would have hoped for more smoke and more of a rub (we ordered them dry with sauce on the side). Of the three, I think that the St-Louis were the best.  We also had brisket, pulled pork and chicken. All three of these need lots of smoke (in my view) to be a success and there just was not enough. The brisket was not sliced and had no barque. It was more of a \"pulled\" format in small pieces. It tasted a bit dry and lacked smoke.  Overall, it's OK but not great. I'm stuck between going with 2 or 3 stars on this because the sides weren't all that fantastic either (mac & cheese, fries, grilled veg, ranch beans). However, it is still decent BBQ if you stick to the right items (ribs).",

    "text": "We JUST finished an amazing dinner at Bobby Q tonite.  We are in town for a week from Southern CA for a baseball tournament for my son & looked to Yelp for a top BBQ joint in town that we don't have in our neck of the woods.  We hit a grand slam choosing Bobby Q.  From the minute we sat down, our waiter Tommy (who was fantastic), told us the history of the place, made recommendations for us & was very attentive the entire meal.  The cornbread muffins were delicious.  We ordered the Q rolls & spinach artichoke cheso dip as appetizers.  The Q rolls were AMAZING - highly recommend.  The spinach dip was very good, especially when I asked for tortilla chips instead of the bread that comes with it.  For our meal we got the big \"Hog Meal\" I think it was called.  You get to choose 2 types of ribs (a full rack), we got a full rack of baby back, 2 types of meats (1 lb), we chose brisket & pulled pork & 3 sides but we chose 4, coleslaw, mac n cheese, fries & roasted corn.  BY FAR the best meat was the baby back ribs.  The bones were just there for looks cuz that meat FELL OFF THE BONE.  They were so good.  The pork was tasty too, brisket was our #3 favorite but very tender.  The coleslaw is delicious, my son loved the mac n cheese & fries & the corn was smokey yummy tasting too.  At the end, when they bring the bill, they bring these SINFUL homemade donuts with the check.  OMG!!  They were so good.  I had to get a second little bagful on the way out.  We also bought the sauce they use.  They sell it if you loved it.  We loved it.  Definitely recommend this place.  Our waiter Tommy made our experience here awesome.  Drinks were good, service good, food good.  5 stars for sure!",

    "text": "\"You smell like smoke.\"  That's the greeting I received when coming home from a terrific UYE organized by BBQ lovin' Deb L.  And at that point, if my stuffed self didn't already know it, I knew I had just eaten some damn good food.  Upon arriving, I had a deja vu moment of being there before...a long time ago, sipping a virgin strawberry daiquiri (I told you it was a long time ago), and thinking I was all that.  Yes, it was Bobby McGee's at one time!  So flash forward 25 years, and I'm having a strawberry lemonade \"adult\" beverage, which was quite tasty btw, in the company of 20 fabulous Yelpers!  We were given corn bread pretty quickly, and it was devoured pretty quickly.  A little on the crumbly side, but delicious nonetheless.  Because my husband could not join us, I went with the 2-meat combo (brisket and pulled pork) so there would be some left to take him.  Yeah, that's my story.  I was a happy eater to find I could order my meats sauce free!  The brisket was good, but a little too fatty.  The pork was really good, however; adequately seasoned and smokey.  I tried the spicy sauce on the table, and found it to be just right, just a little kick to it.  For sides, the mac and cheese was creamy and not lacking in sauce.  Yum.  The roasted corn was really really good.  If corn always tasted that good, I would move to Iowa.  Our service was great and they were accommodating for our request for separate checks with a 20% gratuity.  Our service was actually good enough, especially given a party that size, that I tipped extra.  And I did refrain from eating all of my meal, so that I could have a nice lunch the next day when my husband refused my offer of the leftovers.  Only problem was he didn't refuse.  And I went hungry the next day, wishing I had eaten all of my meal when I had the chance.",

I never went to Bobby McGees unfortunately, but I have been eating at Bobby Qs since it became Bobby Qs. I have never had a bad meal, nor have I seen anyone else not enjoy their meal. I have never had bad service, or even mediocre service. The food and service have always been excellent, above average, wonderful.  I can't say how many times I have been here over the past many years. I used to go at least once a month as it was me and someones date restaurant for a long time. Every time someone visits from out of town, I bring them there. They always request to go back when they are visiting again. I've brought dates to this place, they have always loved it. When I talk to someone else about Bobby Qs, and they've had it in the past, they always say they love it too. I even met someone from out of town that said they go all over the country to eat BBQ and Bobby Qs had their favorite ribs of anywhere they've ever been to!  I've been to going away parties, birthday parties, tons of stuff, and I've still never met anyone to complain about this place.  The only complaints I've ever heard is of the club. Who cares about the club? This is about the restaurant, the food, the service. Not some dance club where some teeny bopper got in a fight with her boyfriend so they had a bad night so they are going to complain about Bobby Qs. Come on now!  Try the amazing, phenomenal food that Bobby Qs is!! The cornbread is great, the nice donuts they give you as you're leaving are delicious and the spicy bbq sauce is my favorite. I like that they sell their bbq sauce so I can have it at home too! It feels comfortable inside as well, the decor is nice. The outside patio is a great spot when the weather is nice. My dad lives 1800 miles away and is always asking me if I've eaten there recently and to take pictures of the outside water chains so he can replicate that at his house.",

The cornbread starter was awesome - I could have eaten all that was in the basket, but had to be considerate ;-) Upon a yelper's recommendation (thanks, Jacob!), I had the St. Louis style BBQ ribs with sides of roasted corn and pecan coleslaw.  The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, so amazingly good. The more sedate flavors of the sides were a good counterpoint for the intensely savory ribs. We shared desserts -- the chocolate overload was good, and the peach cobbler was not overly sugared like it usually is in most establishments. I like it better that way because the taste of the fruit comes out more, although apparently the others preferred sweeter.  My only gripe was the lighting: on our table, the spotlight-like fixture above me shone harshly on me while keeping the others in comfortable darkness. The servers were friendly and efficient, and the mini donuts given on the way out were scrumptious. This is one place for many return visits, and I'll make sure they seat me in an area without a mini-searchlight above.",

It isn't Texas BBQ, it isn't Kansas City BBQ, it isn't North Carolina BBQ. It is Arizona BBQ (If we had such a thing) - I can't get over the little things they do right here. From their BBQ egg rolls to their brisket, and little donuts for desert.. Where to start!? My wife and I generally get a 3 meat combo because you get a lot of variety. Their sauce is great they have a nice kick and I like that they do it right and not slather it on for you. Over the holidays this past year we had placed a reservation and we were accommodated easily. 16 people, not a single mistake, billing was done perfectly, and everyone was attentively taken care of during the meal. It so rarely happens with large groups we were impressed with the service. The prices are really reasonable compared to a few places that are a significantly closer for us, When people come to town, hungry - I send them your way. Keep up the great BBQ we'll be back soon!",

One of my pet peeves is when a staff member has to go and ask someone about a question I have about the menu.  Its pretty obvious the staff here is trained really well.  I had the ribs which were perfectly cooked.  Again though, not the type of place I go for, its also kind of has a upscale feel almost, but definitely not your hole in the wall BBQ place.",

My friend ordered a full rack of ribs (half St Louis, half baby back) and I tried some of it....and I have to say it was incredible. The meat was nice and soft and just melted in your mouth.  I really can't think of any negatives about this place, especially when they brought 4 complimentary mini donuts to us on our way out.  I will definitely be going here again and is well worth the money that you will spend there.",

The chicken, well can you just say extremely bland & beyond dry.

A Florida restaurant would be closed down if they served crap like that.

With reviews upon reviews and pictures of the whole hog heaven the boyfriend and I told ourselves that we would not be tackling that beast on our own... but we did. After a conversation with our waiter it really did seem like the best option to sample what Bobby Q had to offer. And for the amount of food given, it was well worth the price.  Although overwhelmed when the platter arrived to our table, the boyfriend and I found ourselves quickly working our way through it. We had enough leftovers to stuff one person senseless.   Do yourself a favor and opt for the baby back ribs and the st louis ribs. You get more bang for your buck this way instead of going for the beef back ribs which they will only serve you two of with the Whole Hog. Shoestring fries, baked beans, and mac and cheese were on point and if i had to do it all over again I probably wouldnt have gotten the pulled pork and asked for more brisket instead.",

I'm a pretty picky eater and the food was beyond what I expected.  We all shared. We ordered ribs, prime rib, pulled pork, and the amazing Q's for an appetizer. We finished with a mud pie and banana freeze dessert.  While waiting to be sat all the way to finishing our meal, we were educated about the extensive preparation that goes into their food, Bobby Q's brewed beer (which was very good!), and all of the ways they prepare all of the food on the menu.  A HUGE thank you to manager Jack Lineberger!!  He was awesome and made our experience awesome enough to post on Yelp.  Thank you Jack!  We will stop by the next time we are in town!",

So we left and got a quick snack to hold us over down the street . We returned  30 min later & the place was half empty  with the same hostess at the front had called us twice. Where did 1 1/2  hour wait go? No big deal.  So by this time we forgo the dinner idea and ordered  cocktails and a couple brisket sandwiches along with the sides. \"\" WOW\"  Wheres the beef ?  It sure wasn't on our table it looked more like an empty Mcdonalds bun. The sides were good along with the tad of beef. Table service was A+ and triple A+  to the nicest lady flr mgr who was working hard helping out on the tables...... Sweet idea with the donuts...   Big disappointment - over $40.00 bucks &  no beef.

Split the whole hog, 2 1/2 slabs of ribs, 2 piles of meat, 3 sides. Amazing, a bit past tender (fine by me) but perfect rub and sauces. Mac n cheese was crazy good. Staff and service was very friendly, restaurant was done very well, enough southern comfort without the hee haw cheese, no wonder it was still packed at 8:30 with people still waiting to be seated",

Delicious.  Best BBQ I've had since I do not remember when.  My eldest ordered smothered fried chicken.  It was well seasoned and I used it to explain what it's like in the south.  Peppery perfect.  At the end of our meal we were given \"to go\" doughnuts. Happy full family right now.  We will be back soon.",

    "text": "We were in the area and decided to Yelp our dinner location. This place came up at the top of the search with over 500 reviews, you know we had to see what all the fuss was about. Coming down 27th street we thought Google Maps was getting us lost. There was no way a bomb BBQ joint was next to all these apartments. Well once we passed the last apartment building on the right, we saw Bobby's. The building was not impressive from the parking lot, not to mention we were parked behind the restaurant. I thought rusty shack = good food. I was glad I stuck with my instinct.  We turned the corner and could instantly smell the smoker putting in work on slabs of ribs and brisket. Inside the decor was modern and clean. After seating we were greeted quickly and with a smile. I could hardly listen to what she saying because my eyes were fixated on the 40 chickens rolling in the rotisserie oven. We ordered the Hog Heaven plate for three of us, while my son had the smokehouse burger. Let me just say this is plenty of food for a family of 4. Four choices of meats with three sides. I highly recommend the baby back ribs as one of the meats. If you have no teeth, you can still chew these. My mouth had an orgasm when I bit into them. They were so tender, there was no knife needed to separate them. The brisket, St. Louis ribs, and chicken rounded out the plate. Mac and cheese side dish is a must! So creamy and the cheese was outstanding. You can tell that time was taken to prepare our meal that came out quickly. The cornbread was oven hot and was perfectly cooked with a hint of crunchiness on the edges. I had the Bobby Q Ale for my drink and it was a solid choice. It was very bold and complimented the BBQ sauce that was all over my fingers. Visit this place in the near future, hopefully your experience is as good as mine. This spot moved into the first priority when dining out in Phoenix.",

I also LOVED sitting outside on the patio, because there were little birdies flying around, and one landed on our table for some cornbread crumbs I left for him.

I think the patio is better than inside because it's spacious, and there are mist to cool the temperature off. We ordered Hog Heaven, fried onion rings and couple drinks for four of us, and we couldn't even finish all the food.   Corn breads are delicious and just like the ones I had in North Carolina. It's not too sweet, outside of corn bread is a bit crispy and inside is soft. When you placed the butter on the top of corn bread, and the butter just melts right of away. This combination added extra flavor to corn breads.   Whole Hog Heaven: beef ribs, pulled chicken, baby backs, prime briskets, mac & cheese, meshed potatoes, roasted corns.   Man o Man, They are so delicious. briskets are moist and tender. you don't need to add any bbq sauce. Prime briskets are great to eat by itself. I like to eat mac & cheese after having briskets. M&C here are really good with a slide sweet taste in it.   - Baby backs were cooked so well and the meat fell off the bones easily.  - Pulled chicken was juicy and didn't have the dryness that chicken breasts usually have.  - Beef rib is delicious and still attached to the bone, some people like it roasted so the meat would fall off easily. However, for me, I prefer to chew the bone. very yummy.  If you ever visit Phoenix, definitely stop by here and make reservation at least couple days ahead of time.",

The patios are awesome with great water features.  The seating is comfortable and the lighting is perfect with the setup. It's all. Well balanced.   We started with the Q rolls because all the reviews on here said we should. Yep. Yelpers are right. Tasty!  Let me take just a brief moment to tell you about Caleb our waiter. What a great guy!  He gave us a run down of what's what with his cute helpful self. We came late, which can be a problem, and the service and staff were so friendly.   Ok back to it...  Next was the wedge salad and yummy. Caleb (the rockstar) split it without us even asking.   the chunks of blue cheese and the crispness of the iceberg were awesome. You could hear the couch from the lettuce. The crispy onions on top were a bonus.   We went with the massive meat platter and three sides. The beef ribs were massive and not stringy at all. As Caleb told us, all meat is cooked 22 hours or something.   The pork was shredded perfect with the right amount of BBQ sauce. The brisket, my favorite was sooo tender. Mmmm meat.   We had the corn, mac and cheese and beans. I tried them all and felt they were all a great \"goes along with\" but mostly ate meat.   What a great dinner out!  Great food, ambiance, and amazing staff.  Caleb thanks for being a great server and hope to have the pleasure of your service again.",

    "text": "This place was AMAZING! Thank you help for pointing us in this places direction. We were late for our reservation (that we made here on Yelp) but we were still immediately seated when we arrived.   What we had  Q-Rolls: You have to get these. Crispy on the outside, tender flavorful brisket on the inside. Both dipping sauces were great. Literally waited maybe 3 minutes for them to come out.   Full Baby Back Rib meal with mash potatoes and grilled veggies. My son was freaking out over how tender the ribs were. Falling off the bone. He said both sides we're good too.   2 Meat Combo with Brisket and St Louis ribs. Everything was juicy. Ribs were falling off the bone. I only needed a fork to eat them. I had the Mac and cheese and the baked potato. I like my Mac and cheese more baked than creamy but the flavor was great.   Apple cobbler was piping hot. The ice cream was melted in minutes. Not my favorite cobbler. I like mine with more crumble oaty topping but thats just me.   The dessert donuts at the end we're perfects crispy and soft on the middle.   Four thumbs up to our server Harlod (per the receipt) but I swore his name was Hal. He was so friendly, informative and quick to refill drinks. He also checked on us frequently.   If we are ever back in Phoenix we will for sure eat here again. Tons better than any BBQ spot we're tried in San Diego.",

Service was good, but today for lunch was less than it's usual 5 Star Level. A bit slow initially to take our orders, and to deliver our check. Also ribs tasted reheated and not freshly cooked.

I recommend making reservations if you're planning to dine during the weekend because this place is definitely popular with the tourists and locals, but the wait has never been awful. 5/5 stars!",

The check, that brings me to another issue... we were a party of 3 (easy right?) so we ordered the big meal thingy (Whole Hog Heaven) and we split it and as a party of 3 (couple and a single) we asked the waitress with our check to use 1 card for a 1/3rd of the check and 2/3rds for the balance.  She pauses and says I will do it by your meals, I remind her that we ordered ONE BIG MEAL and need to split, she says \"OK no problem, I have a calculator back there...\"   Waitress and our check comes back and she did 1/4 and 3/4 to which I asked why and what the confusion was and while she was miffed, she offered to take the cards and re-do the charges, I declined this.  It's sad these are the things that were the most memorable of our visit.  BBQ was just \"OK\", over priced and really not that great given the \"we've heard this and that about this place\".  I will be in no rush to go back, it wasn't horrible ... it just wasn't great and add in the service issues, enough to go to other great BBQ options in the valley.  The corn bread and the donuts were really good, I will say that!",

We then ordered the platter combo of pulled pork with mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. The mac was ahhhhmazing! The pork was also very good and I really liked the bbq sauce on it.   The food was all great and reasonably priced. Nathan was great and very attentive throughout our entire meal. The manager also popped out to check on us, which I always appreciate.

Steak, chicken, and shrimp were delicious (steak especially so, best I've had in a while).

Can't forget to mention their mac n' cheese, so creamy and cheesy, best mac n'cheese in the world! I might be reaching, but I promise you it was oh so good! Also we loved the cornbread. Cute little patties is how they come out, and we can't tell you how those little donuts they serve after each meal, how tasty those little things are, a little sweet and crunchy on the outside, soft and doughy on the inside.

    "text": "Landed in Phoenix and read all of the positive reviews here. I'm not really a meat girl but wanted to try this since barbecue is popular in Arizona. The restaurant itself has really nice to court and clean the staff was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the beef brisket and ribs which is good enough for two people. We ordered that with a side of the mac & cheese which was absolutely amazing and grilled vegetables to balance everything out. The bill wasn't so bad either I can get Casas around $30 which is pretty good for quality meat. Before we left we were given a complementary sugar donuts which definitely hit the spot. I'm giving this place 4 stars only because when we left we felt extremely heavy. I think it was the extra sauce that we asked for so definitely don't do that besides that this is a definity a Must",

Delicious. Just pure delicious. I got to sample the macaroni, and I must say it does indeed live up to the hype... The creamy, cheesy goodness doesn't disappoint. Even the cornbread with butter was delicious and its complimentary!!  To wash it down I ordered the bobby q amber ale, and it was more than up to the task to compliment my meal.   If you're on the fence, like bbq, or just want a nice atmosphere do yourself a favor and stop by Bobby Q's. You're going to like what you ate. I guarantee it.",

He made sure we left the restaurant satisfied.  Even his manager came by to see if we were enjoying the experience.  The meal started with their Q-Rolls.  Seasoned beef brisket with a BBQ dipping sauce and a chipotle dip.  They are always great.  Aggie ordered Smoasted chicken (smoked. & roasted) with BBQ.  Her sides were Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.  She enjoyed it very much.  I ordered Beef brisket with Ranch Beans and mashed potatoes.  It was very, very good.  I enjoyed every bit.    Mikaela ordered the Kid's Cheeseburger with fries.  I took a bit of her cheeseburger, and the beef tasted better than anything from other burger places.  I couldn't believe it.    To drink, Mikaela ordered their sweet tea (best I have tasted from any restaurant), and Aggie and I ordered Frosted Lemonades.  They were tart and sweet, and sugar coated the glass.  That was a nice touch.  We will definitely come back here.  It is just epic!",

When you arrive at Bobby Q's, the outside makes it feel as if you are about to walk into a dive.  However when you turn the corner and walk in the door, that is not the case.  Very nice ambiance throughout the entire restaurant. They had wonderful mood lighting! I love low mood lighting!  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  Our meals were excellent.  My husband got the Chicken Fried Chicken and I got the Top Sirloin.  We started with the corn bread, which was delicious!  I don't care if it feel apart at least it wasn't dry!  My top sirloin was cooked a perfect Medium and seasoned exceptionally well.  I really loved it and I love steak.  Surprisingly the roasted corn was one of my favorites of the night, I don't usually gobble up corn when I get it with dinner, but man, this was some heavenly corn!  My husbands chicken fried chicken was perfect.  Pounded thin, with a light crispy batter, I hate to say it, but it might have been better than Texaz Grill's chicken!  It was tasty.  My son got the oven cooked pepperoni pizza and it was a large portion for the $4.00 price tag, he even took some home.  Our food was excellent, there wasn't one thing we didn't like, the food was hot, the service was great, the atmosphere was great, we will return!",

We like to try new places, but the last three or four have been bad.  This time I went to Yelp to find a few possibilties.  We decided BBQ was the flavor of the day.  Bobby Q;s was the second listing by ratings,but they had an impressive number of reveiws, and they were close to our stops for the day. Okay, on to the meal...It was fantastic!  The lunch menu is fairly priced for what you get.  I went for the most expensive thing( $13.00), a 3 meat sampler plate.  I ate way too much, but it was so good.  The hubby got the smokehouse burger,  he loved it, talked half the way home about how good it was.  He grew up near Memphis, where BBQ is a staple and he loved the BBQ sauce.  The cornbread cakes were a great starter, and the doughnuts they gave us for a finisher were all the dessert we had room for.   Last but not at all least, Jo did a wonderful job of taking care of us and answering any questions that we had.   We will be back, probably next trip to Phx.",

    "text": "Bobby Q's is the BEST BBQ restaurant in the valley. Better then Famous Daves. Better then Waldo's, in my opinion. This used to be Bobby McGee's in the 90's and they would have live band and dancing there. I went there with my wife, mother-in-law and daughter. We didn't make reservations because we didn't know you had to until we had called them that day. At the time, they weren't taking anymore reservations until after 8pm and that was too late for us. It was only 3:30p at the time. The woman on the phone said the wait time was about 45mins, so we went anyways. We got there around 4:00pm and put our names on the list. They said they would call us when the table was ready. I kind of missed the little pagers we usually get at Cheesecake Factory and other restaurants, but personal service is still nice too. So I waited 30mins, checked the list and there were still 2 groups ahead of us. Check again at 45mins and still one group ahead of us. The hostess apologized and explained that customer with reservations would get seated first, which made sense, but I was getting hungry. Finally 55mins in we got seated (near the kitchen door) and was able to order drinks immediately as we looked over the menu. They had some specials, so I got the Prime Rib/Lobster Tail with 2 sides for $30. I got the Mac & Cheese and Corn I believe. I can't remember what everyone else got, but I know they loved the food. They brought out warm corn bread, which was moist, sweet and great with butter. My wife and mother-in-law loved their alcoholic drinks. I got lemonade which was excellent as well. The meals came after about 15mins. The prime rib simply melted in your mouth. It was delicious. The Mac & Cheese was perfect. Nice and creamy and cheesy, just like how I make it. My wife tried mine and loved it. I tried her bake beans and even those were incredible. The corn was also good, Even the coleslaw that I tasted was very tasty. The lobster, we juicy and I doused it in the butter for another bite. It was cooked perfectly. I tried my wife's Baby Back Rib and they were smokey, moist and incredible with the BBQ sauce. I couldn't believe how good everything was. The waitress came back and forth to our table at least 6-7 times during the meal to see if there was anything else we needed. Very friendly and courteous. My daughter, who's only 2.5yrs loved everything, especially the mac & cheese since she loves cheese. Definitely one of the best BBQ meals I've ever ate. I will probably get the Brisket or Baby-Back Rib the next time I go. If you have BBQ and Steak, this is the place to go. It was definitely worth the wait and the kitchen door didn't even bother me because I was enjoying the food. I forgot a couple things. i forgot to mention the appetizers. They give you a lot for the appetizers. We got the BBQ wings and Artichoke/Spinach dip and it was fabulous. some places will give you 5-6 wings for appetizer, but we got like twice that amount and it was delicious. At the end of the meal they give you soft delicious donuts for free. 5 stars from me here.",

The food was extremely bland from the cornbread to the cloe slaw and even every meat on the sampler platter everything lacked any kind of flavor. This was extremely suppressing based on all of the raving reviews this place has. Maybe the cooks had an off day. There were two exceptions though the Mac and cheese was hands down the best I have ever had at a BBQ place and the Q rolls were amazing. Service was okay, but there was one thing that really made me uneasy about the place while eating I was watching the bar back cutting limes. First he wasn't wearing any gloves which is gross seeing that those limes go straight into drinks. But he then cut himself on the slicer, I could tell by his expression, he looked down at the cut and then continued to slice more limes. This really disgusted me so I decided to tell a manager. She came right But when I told her what had happened I really felt like she could care less. When we were finished talking she didn't even go remove the limes from the bar but went off to do something else. The food was definitly a dissapointment especially for the $50 price tag but again everyone has an off day, but I definitely won't be back because of what I witnessed and how little was done to fix it.",

    "text": "I was staying at a hotel about .8 miles away as I was going to the Fiesta Bowl, and I noticed that they had an ad about delivering food to the hotel. Then I started reading the small print. Does not include tip, tax, $3 set up charge, etc. I decided to go there so I called. I told the girl where I was staying, lots of one way streets, etc. and asked for directions from my hotel. Lots of um's and ah's and she then asked me to wait until she got someone else on the phone. I almost hung up and then another dizzy girl picked up and she started stammering and stuttering without any clear directions, until she told me to wait until she got someone else on the phone, and I said, \"never mind\" and hung up. I went to the front desk at the hotel and the woman there gave me clear directions in about  2 minutes. I was on the phone with the two dingbats for about 15 to 20 minutes. I drove over and it took about 5 minutes to get there. I walked in and the restaurant was packed, so I went into the lounge to see if I could order in there. As I was walking about, I received \"hard\" looks from the guys on duty there, bouncers I guess. I looked at the jerk, turned around and went to the reception area and asked one of the young ladies how long it would take for a table for one. She said about an hour and a half. I asked her if she was serious and she said \"yes\", so I left. When I got back to the hotel, I tried to order take out without success. Even though it was before 9PM and the order form said that they delivered up to that time, they said they were not delivering. I gues it was because it was New Years Eve. When I went to the office to look for another restaurant, I met some UConn fans, and as I was talking with them about Bobby Q, they said that Bobby Q wasn't that great when compared to a few CT barbecue places or some Southern places they visited in Charlotte during another bowl game. The famous cornbread did not live up to its rep, so I felt better. Then, they asked if I wanted to try some of their food. They had a bunch of leftovers, that they weren't going to eat, and I had a microwave in my room. Like them, I wasn't impressed with either the food or the famous sauce. More hype than good food, an incompetent wait staff, and nasty looking guys in the lounge does not look like a good time to me. Sorry Bobby Q.",

The food is cheaper during the week but weekends is a bit more expensive....there is too much to tell, you just have to try for yourself, you wont be disappointed.... and you get a free little dessert as you leave ( freshly made mini sugar doughnuts) YUM!!!!",

    "text": "I just went here for lunch today after reading lots of good reviews. I have to say that I cannot argue with the great reviews. The atmosphere is fun and the prices were decent. I ordered the brisket with mac and cheese, BBQ beans, and pecan coleslaw. The hubby ordered the brisket, pulled pork, shoestring fries and roasted veggies. The meats was amazing, so tender and moist. The BBQ sauce had the perfect flavor, not too tangy but not too sweet, and also not too thick. And the sides, OMG sooooo good. The mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy, the beans were sweet and meaty, and the coleslaw was creamy, refreshing, and the pecans were a nice contrast. The hub let me try his fries and although they were very small and thin, they had a good flavor and I loved that some were soggy (I love soggy, greasy fries). Oh and how could I forget, they give you cornbread cakes before your dinner arrives. They were very tasty. They also give you mini hot doughnuts with cinnamon and sugar at the end of your meal. They were good, however, a little dry. I think they could have used more flavoring in the dough or maybe some sort of icing to dip them in. My only other complaint is that our waitress was a bit slowing in refilling our water and bringing a box along with our check. I would say that this place definately lives up to the hype and positive reviews. However, living in Maricopa, it takes close to an hour to get to Bobby Q's. So I probably wont be driving out there just to eat at Bobby Qs but if I was in the neighborhood, I would definately make sure to stop  :)",

My wife and I both had the brisket plate.  At some places brisket can be dry, but here it was moist and flavorful.  My sons had brisket and pulled pork sandwiches and loved them.  Although after seeing the huge hamburger at the next table my one son wanted that.  As for sides we shared the onion block and everyone had the Mac and cheese; both were great. Just when I thought I couldn't eat any more they brought us small, hot, moist doughnuts that they provide for free.  As it turned out I wasn't that full as they were too good to pass up.  I must also say that the quality of service matches the quality of food.  Our server Emmy provided award winning service with a smile, making us feel at home.  The decor also felt comfortable with a real old time BBQ house look.  If you love BBQ, Bobby Q's is a place you need to try.",

Their beef brisket is so tender, baby back rib falls off the bone so good. beef rib was also good but after trying different sides all of us ordered, if I ever come back to Phoenix, I will surely come back and order a baby back rib w/ mashed potatoes and roasted veggies with extra bbq sauce to dip the meat in.

Wait there is more...she asked if I wanted my mushrooms sliced or whole. What?? Seriously?? I've never been given an option on mushrooms before, pretty awesome.

The spicy sausage and brisket was our favorite; the complimentary cornbread was great as well.   All in all, a 5-star restaurant that we'll definitely be going back for more. We literally ate until we couldn't any more and then the check came to save us from ourselves... then the magic happened. After we paid our check, our waitress came back with a bag of the complimentary cinnamon sugar donuts we had watched them make fresh while we waited for our table. The perfect way to end the evening!",

    "text": "Caveat Emptor--- If you like REAL BBQ this is not the place for you.  The first clue was that the place slathers it's food in sauce as a rule, not an option.  I have no idea how they can smoke their meats for up to 22 hours without having any noticeable hint of smoke.  And don't tell me that, \"it has a smoke ring so it has to be good\"(that's just a natural reaction of nitric oxide).  The brisket was bland, the beef ribs had essentially no meat, the pork ribs had a little flavor, and the pulled pork was downright appalling and stringy and flavorless.    Sides of grilled vegetables were flavorless and bitter.  The pecan coleslaw was bland, and the pecan part was just a sprinkle of untoasted pecans sprinkled on top, and the ranch beans were very vinegary (a welcome bit of flavor)  I have no idea how this place was voted a best BBQ place in the nation unless it was by a bunch of people that have no tastebuds, in fact, I would rank this as some of the worst I've had in the nation.    This place needs to up their game, Phoenix has BBQ that is infinitely better and at half the price.    The service was fine, but the management is a bit overbearing.  When you need to toot your horn about how good you are to every table when they sit, it really shows that you're not that great, greatness speaks for itself.  Bottom line, my family will not return, and will never recommend that anyone else does.  Please search out any small local BBQ pit and get some real food with real flavor.",

We were seated within five minutes (although they originally said 15-25 minute wait), and our server was there almost instantly.  Since we couldn't take leftovers with us, he recommended that the three of us split the three meat combo, and that was perfect!  We got the baby-back ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.   While the pulled pork was just OK, the ribs and the brisket were wonderful (our daughter, a rib snob if there ever was one, pronounced the ribs as being the best she'd ever had)!  The pre-meal cornbread was decent (a bit crumbly), and the free cinnamon-sugar mini-donuts after the meal were tasty, if a bit over-sugared.   We also ordered two sides: the baked potato with all the fixings was good, and the mac & cheese was close to incredible (never thought I'd put the words \"mac & cheese\" and \"incredible\" in the same sentence, but there you go).  All through the meal, our server checked on us every five minutes or so, and was always there with iced tea & soda refills, extra sauce, and so on.  And we were in and out in less than 30 minutes (usually I don't care, but with a flight to catch, that was important).   Wish these guys were closer to Boise -- I know we'd be regulars!  If you're in a hurry, might want to call ahead for reservations.   As busy as they were on a Sunday afternoon, I suspect that they are a madhouse at peak hours.",

We were seated right away tho. Our server, Amber, greeted us quickly. We were brought menus and cornbread as we made our drink orders.   For entrees we ordered the Ribeye with baked potato and side salad and I got the three meat combo. I ordered Brisket, Baby Back Ribs and a Hot Link. My sides were Mac N Cheese and Pecan Cole Slaw. It all came to $80 plus tip with two glasses of wine.  The entrees were good. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, had minimal gristle and was flavorful. The ribs were very tender. The brisket was good but personally I don't like BBQ sauce on my brisket but that's the way it came. The hot link had no snap but was tasty.   The Mac n cheese was excellent but the slaw was very boring. Why five stars?  Good food, excellent service and decent value.",

Service was very friendly too.  I'd recommend the brisket and baby back ribs. My boyfriend said the St. Louis ribs were just ok. The sides were equally delicious! The mac and cheese + cornbread (complimentary) were my favorites!!!  Compared to Phil's BBQ, our party agreed that Bobby Q's is much tastier.   Next time we'll opt to dine in, and I'd like to try the bread pudding as well!",

    "text": "\"I LIKE PIG BUTTS and I cannot lie\"  When visiting a new city, I try to eat things we don't have in Hawaii. Good BBQ is one of them so I'm no expert, but this place was so finger-licking-I'm-on-vacay-screw-my-diet good! Since we only had one shot to try everything, we tried the sampler:  WHOLE HOG HEAVEN $48 2 choices of ribs (we got baby back and St. Louis, I would get double baby back next time) 2 choices of meat (we got pulled pork and brisket, totally would get that again) 3 sides (we got roasted corn, beans, grilled veggies, but the shoestring fries were also very good)  KIDS MENU too! The kids had the chicken strips (which is like the breaded processed kind you get in the freezer), which they absolutely enjoyed because it is familiar to them. The key to a good kids menu is to offer things kids like (not mini versions of the adult food), and they do very well here. (We also ordered the appetizer chicken tenders, which is more like real chicken, real batter and they didn't like that as much.)  BBQ sauce- when asked if we wanted extra sauce, (regular or spicy?) I asked for both. I thought they'd bring little containers but hallelujah they thought of everything-we got little coffee pots of sauce brought to the table. Try the meat first before you drown it with sauce because it really needs no sauce! But I love sauce. I dipped the fries in it, the corn in it, the beans in it, I love good sauce. We (or I) emptied both pots of sauce, but TRY THE SPICY sauce! It's not that spicy and was delicious!  Service was great, and the little things like complimentary cornbread cakes and cute freshly made on the spot \"THANK Q\" cinnamon sugar donuts was a nice treat!  Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Barbeque is not my favorite style of cuisine. There. I said it. That having been said, I find myself going to BBQ restaurants on a regular basis because the men in my life live for it. So I got talked in to hitting up Bobby Q. Sure...why not...  The food at Bobby Q is EXCELLENT. Probably the best BBQ I've ever had and as I said, I don't like BBQ very much. Very flavorful, not overly sauced, good sized portions. All around, excellent.  So why the 3 stars? Three reasons.  1) RIDICULOUSLY high prices. It's BBQ, not Morton's steak house. Our party of 4 bill was nearly $100 and there wasn't an alcoholic beverage in sight....  2) Service was not up to par at all. You do not leave the appetizer dishes on the table when you are putting down the dinner dishes. And you don't leave said dishes on the plate after the lady of the table has gone out of the way to stack said dishes perfectly so you can easily take them away. And you don't leave them until said lady has to ask you 3 times to take them away.   3) Restaurant was dirty. Sorry but leaving tables unbussed all around us just isn't acceptable at the prices you are charging much less at a lower-price-point establishment.   Bobby Q...get your service up to par, take a good look at your price points, and CLEAN. I'll be back I'm sure since the men in my life love BBQ. I would love to be able to raise your stars!",

This place has got it and the sweet ice tea to go with it (one of the few things I miss from SC). My boyfriend and I dropped in here because we were in the neighborhood, and right off the smell was heavenly. It wasn't very busy, so I don't know if things would be different at another time, but the waitress was very friendly and we ordered and got our food in a timely fashion. Everything was delicious. We sat outside and I really enjoyed the sounds of the fountain (shaped like a still I think) and all the little succulents growing on the brick wall.",

    "text": "Bobby Q's entrance off 27th Avenue is subtle and in a quiet area and one of the first things you notice pulling into their lot through the small driveway flanked by bushes is that the place (and its lot) is huge.  It's obvious from its construction, that this building has been here a long time and the massively tall trees in the parking lot confirm that.  I actually parked in an \"adjacent\" lot next to the main one and had a decent walk to the restaurant's entrance around the corner.  The much larger bar facing the lot is NOT the entrance to go through to access the restaurant.  Before meeting my date here, I took a look at the menu and had a mild sticker shock.  The prices are not unreasonable for a Valley restaurant; but being that we usually eat in $ or $$- restaurants, it was quite a bit more than what I'm used to.  The important question, however, wasn't whether the prices were \"high\", but whether food quantity and quality justified them.  We started out with drinks.  I had the Strawberry q Lada ($9.00), which was quite delicious, with the strawberry and pina colada blending very well together.  While waiting for dinner, they also brought cornbread for each of us with butter, which was also quite good, though had it been hot instead of lukewarm,it  would have been excellent.  My date ordered the half baby back ribs with cole slaw and baked potato.  In her case, this was very much worth the $20.00 ... and I frankly can't imagine what the \"whole\" for $6.00 more would have been like!  For out came what I can only describe as half of the brontosaurus ribs they used to dump on Fred Flintstone's car; an overflowing bowl of cole slaw and a potato almost as big as the half-ribs.  I ordered the \"smoasted\" half chicken and can only say, that presentation is everything.  It didn't seem close to half a chicken to me; but since it was served in cut up pieces and on a large plate, that might be the reason why I thought otherwise.  For sides, I had the fully stuffed baked potato (still huge) and the grilled vegetables, which, I can honestly say, should have been double the amount while the potato could've been half the size.  Since my date picked out the restaurant, it was obvious it was a favorite place for her and her husband.  As the \"newbie\", I was very impressed with the taste and while my plate didn't seem to be overflowing like hers, it was more than enough and worth the price.  Before tip, my tab came out to $27.08, including tax.  Service is prompt, friendly and attentive (perhaps a bit too attentive, when you're trying to talk).  Interestingly enough, once the credit card was run, the waitress, who had constantly been checking on us throughout the meal, left us to talk in peace with only an occasional server interrupting to see if we wanted more water or Diet Coke.  Though the restaurant is nowhere near as big as the annexed bar, it is pretty roomy with dark, wood colors and a very high ceiling.    DIABETIC ALERT: ------------------------  A glance at the menu will tell you that this place is pork and beef heavy.  There are only two chicken dishes and its obvious by what comes out, that chicken is not their specialty.  A diabetic will have a very hard time eating \"healthy\" here.  The more serious you are about watching what you eat, the more problems you're going to have navigating the menu.  This place should more likely be considered \"a-once-in-a-very-long-while\" treat.  Looking around tonight, most of the patrons had waist sizes that wouldn't surprise anyone coming here.  For the most part, only the wait staff was thin/proportionate, though not always.  While the food is very good, the staff hospitable and the atmosphere welcoming, this restaurant would probably elicit a big frown on your doctor's face, if he knew you came here ... and probably give HIM a heart attack, if he heard you came here regularly.",

The service- Our server Amberlee (please forgive if misspelled) was pleasant, knowledgable about the menu items, and sooo attentive. Our iced teas never got lower than half full and she was always near if we needed anything. One of the managers even came to the table after we got our meal to ask how everything was. On a scale of 1-10 for service, I'd definitely give a 10.   The food- In one word, WONDERFUL. Amberlee brought out corn muffins right after she took our order, which were not only moist but super tasty. When our prime rib arrived, mine was the 10oz end cut and his was the 14oz medium rare, we were astonished by the portions which were MASSIVE. The meal came with two choices of sides- mine were the loaded(bacon, cheese, sour cream, butter and chives) and roasted corn(corn on the cob roasted on the grill, then the kernels are shaved off and sauteed in butter) while my boyfriend had the mashed potatoes with the white gravy on the side as well as the roasted corn. Everything was perfect- the prime rib was seasoned just right with creamy horseradish and au jus and the sides complimented the meat perfectly.  Once the plates had been cleared, Amberlee returned with a bag of complimentary doughnuts to go. We were so stuffed, but truly appreciated the gesture. The check was approximately $55 for both meals and two iced teas which wasn't bad for what we got. Not only great food, but fantastic service. We are planning on returning and telling all our friends how wonderful Bobby Q is!",

The reviews is what drew us in and off course. Called ahead of time to put our name down. We were pleasantly surprised by the ambiance. The manager, Laura greeted us and ended up seating us. We told her we found the place on Yelp and were from out of town. Our waitress came right away. Super attentive. Laura came back to check on us. Asked us what we ended up ordering (Ribs & Catfish) she insisted we tried the brisket, brought us a little sample.....SHOULDVE ORDERED THE BRISKET!!!!! Oh My Gawd! AMAZING. Even contemplated taking some to go, but we were staring down the barrel of a 7.5 car ride. My sister lives in Goodyear, AZ I already informed her to make the drive!!! Next time we are in town you know where to find us! Oh wait...don't forget the hot fresh mini donuts you get in your \"Thank Q\" bag with your check! They're literally doing everything right.

I've now been going back for 3 years on a regular basis thanks to his response and attention to service.  EVERY time since the first has been exceptional.  From the food to the service to the beer - for singles, couples, and families - this place has the menu to make you drool.

We came at a great time. Was seated promptly. Was greeted by a very friendly server. Told her it was our first time, and she gave us the quick story of the place.  We made our selection and it took no more than 10 mins for the entire meal to come out. That was amazing. Was looking at other tables too, their food came out quick as well. Not only was it FAST, the QUALITY was magnificent! Nom nom nom.   At the end of the meal, we did our check in on Yelp, which earn 10% and also got us a free chocolate cake! Yummmmmmmy!! On top of that, for dining, we get a bag of cinnamon mini donuts!   Only reason why I didnt give them a 5, was because....  The cornbread was so deng DELICIOUS,  they didnt give more. One per guest. And I asked for the price and they said its $1 each. Cmon! Just a little unhappy about that....hopefully that will change one day and they'll give u all u can eat corn bread!!!   We'll definitely return next time we are in town!",

I stopped by for lunch the other day and instead of ordering potato salad or beans with my brisket sandwich I ordered the house salad. Big mistake. I had all the symptoms of salmonella poisoning and fortunately only suffered for two days. I called for two days and spoke to two different on duty managers who both told me the general manager would give me a call when he came in so we could discuss my situation. It's been 4 days and nothing. I guess they don't care about sick customers or even want to discuss. Not sure if we will ever go back.  We went back today and had a good experience. Excellent food and service. Even the GM came by to greet us and apologize for not getting back to me previously. He explained that no one else called about getting sick from the salad. Can't be sure if no one called or if maybe he didn't receive the message or was it just one head of lettuce or caused from something else. Will never know for sure. Today was",

Vince was our waiter tonight and wow above and beyond with customer service along with Chris who is a manager. They must really strive on customer service because man it shows they are all on top of everything here. Ok so where to start we started with the apps of the BBQ beef chimichanga things omg our kids couldn't stop eating them. As for main course my hubby got a half rack of ribs with potato salad and veggies(veggies not so great not even cooked all the way), I got the grilled shrimp in a Chimichurri sauce with Mac and cheese and roasted corn... all of it was amazing and I would order that again, as for my kids they got a pizza and it was very tasty they said. Best part was the desert the little mini donuts Soo yes I would come back my kids even said they will only eat BBQ from here!!!!",

The ribs will flake off the bone with no effort. Mac n cheese drips off the fork, and the cocktails come with beautiful ambiance- mine even came in a pineapple. Our server was Austin and he was great too. As a vacation find while in Arizona, this place was a score.",

Only offer one vegetable - a rotating selection - thankfully I like broccolini which was yesterday's option. There were no wet wipes to be found (or offered) even though we ordered ribs which get messy!! Lastly, this isn't necessarily a reflection of the restaurant as a whole, but our waiter would not shut up! He came by our table like every ten minutes and lingered asking us questions about where we are from and how nice the weather is. I'm all for friendly staff but I'm here to have a nice dinner with someone - not you!",

It is a little hidden gem but obviously not a best kept secret as this is one of a gazillion reviews. It is exactly what you'd expect in awesome bbq. The place is bigger that what I'd imagined. Fantastic service all around. Uber impressed with all of the staff, including other servers and bartender willing to help their coworkers. We had the wedge which was a basic wedge with all the fixin's and the three meat bbq plate. The brisket, sausage and chicken was fabulous. You even get a wee pitcher of spicy bbq sauce upon request. Nothing negative to report. Highly recommend. These folks got this dialed in.",

Two things: First of all it was so HOT in there...and we were not the only ones using our menue to fan ourselves, I even saw a Lady using her TO GO box as a fan! Second the hostess service was awful! The girls working up front, the ones  seating folks and the one taking  reservations all seemed to have shitty attitudes (maybe they were hot too). Oh and I'd like to add a suggestion...STOP seating folks at the table by the rotisserie for Gods sakes!!!!! None of your customers want to sit there!!! (Especially in summer months). They tried to seat us there tonight ....NO Way...we've sat there (felt like a punishment, like it is the place you put customers you don't care about....worst table in the place!! We paid our dues...we've sat there!!! LoL. The food is great...customer service lacked big time tonight! Being in a hot resturant was very uncomfortable!!! I do wanna say we have been there many times often bringing family and friends to this place where the food is so yummy. Service is usally good and  if ya dont get stuck at that rotisserie table it is pretty comfortable there. Thanks!",

Everything is fun here.  The atmosphere has such a cool and comfortable vibe.  The cornbread was amazing.  When my fried chicken came out it looked dry to me.  I was wrong.  It was so tender and the mashed potatoes and delicious gravy were a perfect complement.    They have great signature drinks, wonderful artisian beers, and a nice selection of wine.  The sports on the numerous tvs and the country music in the background make the place a riot.  This is a great place for a fun night out and really good food.  You'll love it.",

    "text": "A few years back I had seen this cool looking building surrounded by a trees...behind of all things in Phoenix....a scuba dive shop.  I had no idea exactly what it was.  That was until this time around (2018), when we busted out the oracle that is yelp and learned that is \"Bobby Q.\"  A play on BBQ....rightfully so.  Craving MEAT....we opted to pay this location a visit after some afternoon baseball. We parked in the front which was actually the back and enjoyed the greenery.  There was no issues what so ever on getting a table.  Fast and friendly service.  The interior is hard to describe.  I can only say that it is very cozy.  Every employee there was all smiles and working their tails off.  Our server...damn, if I can remember her name and I lost my receipt....she was awesome!  Happy and quick to suggest something tasty when we asked her.  The first thing she confirmed after we ordered was the \"Q-Rolls,\"  These were delicious pastry style rolls with delicious brisket tucked inside.  They were served with a delicious chipotle sauce.  I was so enamored with them, I forgot to take pictures of anything else....with exception of a delicious coconut mojito, we had ordered prior.  Next up was the \"The Whole Hog Heaven,\"  the GF and I split this amazing plate of BBQ.  It consisted of Baby Back Ribs....so tender the bones popped right out.  Beef ribs of which I devoured.  Pulled pork and Prime Brisket with mac-n-cheese and pecan coleslaw.  All for $51.  We were drunk on BBQ.  So good was what I can only say is the single greatest BBQ experience I have ever had, we chowed until there was nothing left.  NOTHING!  No meat sweats.....maybe just a little.  It was meat nirvana that was complimented by a visit from taylor.  Not sure exactly what his role in the experience is.  I can only saw he is a BBQ sage who wants to help you transition from the physical to the spiritual side of smoked deliciousness.  So full....no desert was ordered.  No matter....Bobby Q has a marvelous little doughnut machine and you are given a complimentary bag of tasty, fried dough.  Wherever we stay next year....you can bet your bottom dollar, we will pay Bobby \"Budda\" Q a visit..........",

My 3rd choice of meat under cons.   Cons:  My menu was sticky... soooo.... wash your hands after touching the menus!!! They should really have the person at the front wipe down the menus every time they get them back...  I could've passed on the pulled pork. The pulled pork tasted better drenched in the bbq sauce.

We got St Louis ribs, sausage, brisket, potato salad, Mac n cheese, baked beans and grilled veggies.  The sides were good...mac n cheese was creamy and cheesy, veggies were grilled just right, baked beans were flavorful and pieces of brisket were in them and the potato salad was seasoned well.  The sausage was a nice combination of seasonings and pork with not to much fat. They advertised it as spicy but I didn't notice any heat.  The brisket had a nice ratio of fat and meat and the ribs were tender.  Overall good bbq at a little higher price than I'd pay normally but it's a more upscale restaurant and the service was very good.",

    "text": "Having lived in town for over 10 years, I'm almost embarrassed to say that I've never been to Bobby Q before, it's somewhat of a Phoenix icon. They've been around for forever it seems, everybody's been there and when you ask about good BBQ spots, they're always in the top 5 on just about everyone's list and top 1 for many. This, my friends changed a few weeks ago, and certainly glad it did.  I invited my nephew out, a picky eater who's list of acceptable meals can be counted on about 11 fingers, but luckily, BBQ is one of them and I decided on Bobby Q. They've got a full bar, everything you're expect on a proper BBQ menu, pulled pork, ribs, brisket, potatoes, mac and cheese, corn bread and a few veggie sides. I really was craving both pulled pork and brisket this visit, but didn't want to spend $30 for my meal, they were happy to accommodate my off the menu request of a sandwich with both brisket and pulled pork, what an awesome way to treat an unusual request. I've been to places that don't like to accommodate and it's super cool that they're not one of them.  They brought the check out and along with it, a bag of fresh mini donuts, two per person. I was drooling over theses bit sized delights as I walked is and saw them cooking them up fresh, but I rarely order dessert out at restaurants, what a cool way to say thanks for coming in. Overall I'd put Bobby Q up at my second or third spot on my personal list, but number one is the type of spot that cooks up their food for the day, opens at 10 am, closes when they sell out for for the day at 1 pm and always has a 30 minute long line of people; not convenient for a dinner on a Tuesday evening.  Thanks for the delicious meal Bobby, not sure what took me so long to come in, but I'm sure I'll be back at some point down the line.",

St. Louis Ribs, Beef Ribs, Sausage and Brisket.  Of all of these meats, the only one that we didn't care for was the brisket.  Something was off and very mushy about it.  Brisket should be able to be pulled apart with your fingers, not completely fall apart like baby food.  For the sides we had baked potato, beans, and pecan coleslaw.  These were also great.  The atmosphere is somewhat contemporary, and very comfortable.  The service rocked!   It's no Mom and Pop place, but a great effort on their part for sure.",

When the bill arrived it was just over $80 because the waitress didn't put the order through with Early Bird pricing (even though when we checked in at 5:17pm I stated we were there for the Early Bird program and was told in the past that as long as you are seated by 5:30pm you qualify for the special prices. Thankfully the manager straightened this out and adjusted the bill but the moral is you can enjoy a delicious dinner at a reasonable price if you get there early enough (and I believe Early Bird dining is only available on weekdays).  I've not been impressed with their limited and not exactly appealing appetizer specials at Happy Hour...just my personal opinion.",

I ordered the pork ribs, beef ribs, and brisket - I'd say just go for the pork ribs as the brisket was a little dry and the beef rib just couldn't compare with the pork one. I came at 10pm when they were closing, and they were super friendly and welcoming! Didn't try to rush me at all.   You also get free tiny donuts at the end of your meal. So nice!",

It has a great atmosphere, great food, and wonderful service. We had the market green salad, Cesar salad, smoked wings for appetizers. Then had ribery steak, filet, baby back ribs! Everything was full of flavor. Working in hospitality myself I was definitely not disappointed. Will definitely be back when we come to Arizona again!",

Eff your rude *ss.   Don't recommend and won't be back. Service is EVERYTHING when eating out.",

Shelby is the best   The food is great and they let you try the ribs before you buy.    It's obvie why they have 4.5 stars",

I ordered the ribs and they were dripping with flavor! My significant other had the burger with bacon (of course I had more than a few bites of his) and we both agreed it was the juiciest burger on the block. The macaroni and baked potato were SO delightful. It was a pretty busy evening for Bobby Q's but they managed very well by tending to their customers in a timely manner.   Their club opens at 11, we had seen people lining up to go in as we left, so you know it must be poppin'. We haven't came here for the club portion, but let my food go down and sooner than you know it I'll be out on the dance floor. Overall, we had a wonderful night; great atmosphere, awesome service & superb food. We even got little doughnuts as a dessert when we left. We will definitely be coming back! And I can't even wait until we come back because it was that good.",

Our waiter, Oliver, was delightfully patient with all 9 of us ladies, some of who couldn't make up their minds. The place is big and open with little to dampen the sound so it was a noisy lunch hour. This turned out not to be a problem--it just meant the other half of our group didn't know we were talking about them! Baskets of yummy warm cornbread appeared on the table and just as magically disappeared. So good!! I ordered the brisket sandwich. The meat was plentiful and it arrived with sauce already on it. It was a little dry and I would have appreciated extra sauce on the table but I was so busy eating I forgot to take a picture. Everyone enjoyed their selections although the brisket won the popularity contest. I enjoyed my lunch and the whole experience. While I couldn't finish my sandwich, I did did not turn down the complimentary warm donuts that suddenly arrived. The food was good, our waiter was great and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I'll be back.",

I decided to come here, and even though it's not my first time, it's probably the best BBQ I've had in a while.  When I first moved here, I used to drive by this place a lot, but being that I lived on the East side for many years, I was to lazy to come here since it was .  Boy, what a to far!  Man, this place was packed tonight!  I had to circle the parking lot like twice just to get a parking space! once inside, I was seated almost immediately at the bar.  After looking over the menu, I went with the Brisket sandwich with mashed potatoes. It came out right away, and man, was it good!   Service was awesome, especially since it was so busy. The bathrooms were pretty cool with big steel sinks and pretty hand soap containers. I will say, I don't get the club thing attached to Bobby Q's, but there was a ton of people in there. I noticed it when I came in, but saw a lot of people in there when I went to the restroom.  They had a sign up with a dress code, and I'm not real sure what that's about, but seemed interesting enough.",

Now, the sides were on the small side.   I ordered the house sangria, it was way to good.  I expected good but not GREAT.   For dessert, YES there was room for dessert, the apple pie cobbler was just warm enough to melt the giant scope of ice cream.   As we left we were given a farewell with cinnamon sugar donuts!  If I ever come back to Phoenix this place is a must!",

We both had the 3 meat lunch with one side. I had chicken, St.  Louis ribs, and brisket. Wife ordered brisket, pork, and St.  Louis ribs, she had the mac and cheese for her side. I could not decide on potato salad or cole slaw, our waitress brought me both! All the meats were some of the very best, the brisket better than any I have ever had. Ribs were good, have had some close, but not quite as good as Bobby's. Chicken was very moist and tender. Corn bread was very good, came with whipped butter but did not need any on it, it stood alone like a champ. The only item that was not absolutely best was the pork. It was good, just not over the top like the other choices. Their potato salad is the BEST, we always measure the salad against MIL's, and this was close. Cole slaw was standard fare with chopped pecans, not a big chopped pecan fan, so I didn't really care for it, was just standard old cole slaw, nothing \"special\". We also got a personal visit from the manager, she was very friendly and sincere. All in all, LOVED IT and will go back.",

Service:  Definitely great service from the wait staff and manager.  The waitor did frequent checkbacks to our table (and those in our section).  He didn't seem rushed or in a hurry, even though it was a busy night.  This being a popular place to eat, I had assumed that we would get the \"rushed waitor\" treatment-- case was the opposite.  The manager came by to check on our meal as well and we received some good recommendations for the future.    Food:  All I can really say is A++ Amazing.  We ordered a full baby-back rack of bbq ribs with macaroni & cheese & fries.  Ribs were definitely the best we've had.  You can tell they don't just slap them on the grill and throw some sauce on it.  Mac & cheese was very creamy, just the way it should be!  The fries were fries, what can I say...?  They were good.    Overall:  We're going back again and again.  The resteraunt was loud at the time, but it's to be expected on a Friday night with music in the bar area.  Didn't mind at all--everyone we saw there seemed as though they didn't mind either.",

My compadre got the same platter but substituted for the sliced beef brisket and pecan Cole slaw so we could both share. Before your food arrives you get two pieces of corn bread and butter and at the end of your meal you receive a sugar donut.  By noon the restaurant was standing room only and our server was very attentive and refilled my ice tea three times. The rib meat really does fall off the bone and you can smell the hickory wood and taste the dry rubbed spices with each bite of rib which was mouthwatering and delicious. We asked the waiter to bring extra BBQ sauce so he brought us the sweet and the spicy sauce to sample.  Baby Back Ribs (Sweet Sauce) ST. Louis Ribs (Spicy Sauce) Sliced Beef Brisket BBQ Pork",

However, the boyfriend and his family are fans and we decided to go eat here this last weekend for the boyfriend's birthday. This night also happened to be the same night of the \"Phoenix Hurricane\" so we were happy to see the power was on, but boy were they busy!  Something I have always found helpful: \"Never eat at a restaurant that's not busy.\"  We had to wait for almost an hour for a table for 6, but we knew that going in and just waited on the patio. I don't know if they are always that busy, but it seemed the waiting area could definitely have more chairs or space for that term of wait. And if the weather happens to not be so agreeable, like that night, they could use a bit more coverage so patrons aren't getting soaked.   Anywho - onto the meat - literally. We were sat and started salivating over the menu - all sounded and looked good (I order via Yelp photos). We each ordered something different and there was a lot of sharing going on. One in our party was happy to hear they still offered the Crab Legs dinner, so take note if that's your fancy. We ordered the Rotisserie Chicken meal with (2) sides: mac and cheese and a loaded baked potato. Everything was delicious and satisfying and was plenty of food - I could have probably taken some home - and all for $13. In my opinion, this place has great prices. I expected, with the look and feel of this restaurant, to be a bit over-charged but I was pleasantly surprised.   Boyfriend ordered the Brisket meal with (2) sides, and dang that meat was tasty! We loved how it came with sauce on it, unlike a lot of these places that are serving you sauceless, dry meat and you have to add it yourself. We also asked for extra and we loved how they brought us our own 'jugs' of regular and spicy (we used up all of the spicy) sauces for the table.   I cannot remember our server's name, but she was awesome. The definition of what service should be in a busy, family style restaurant. We had a lot of requests for her and she was being asked for this and that left and right by almost every member of our table and she handled each one with patience and grace - I was impressed. And I am rarely impressed by servers lately.   If it was pouring, and half of the city's power was out, and we had to wait on the patio for an hour for a table - I would still come here and eat again. I am actually looking forward to it.   OMG those donutsssssssssssss. Make sure you get some.   That 'nightclub' they have though...",

The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious.  The corn bread was soft and fresh.  The fries were the perfect size.  But the best of the best was the smoke house burger.  It was a huge patty on an awesome toasted bun.  It came with shoestring onion stack, bbq sauce, and cheese.  Easily a top 5 burger in the valley.

IMHO, the best sides are the Ranch Beans and the Mac n Cheese....   But, the St Louis Ribs are the reason to eat at Bobby-Q!! These baby back ribs are succulent and the meat falls right off the bone. They have the right balance between rub and sauce. The sweet and tangy flavors are what barbecue is supposed to be. I couldn't find the smoke ring under the rub and the heavy sauce. Sauce-less is not an option. Order an extra cup of the tangy sauce...  The cornbread is moist; a remarkable achievement since most places it's dry as a bone. Bobby-Q's cornbread is excellent and complimentary (Hint, hint to those from Nebraska who believe in charging for dinky little miniature cupcake-sized portions). It's even better with the whipped butter and/or honey on top...  Our waitress was knowledgeable and her service was top-notch. Our iced tea glasses were NEVER empty and she refilled the corn bread basket TWICE. (Hint, hint Nebraska...)  My only REAL complaint is the handicapped parking situation. The handicapped parking spaces are a couple hundred feet from the front door. I try to park out back near the \"Take-Out\" door. There are six spaces there. These spaces are approx 75 ft from the dining room doors, but are NOT reserved for the handicapped.",

To start it off one of the bartenders jumped up on the cooler where they keep clean glasses and is also at the bar top height where people's food and drinks were. Then the same bartender took a container that was used to keep mixing tools and mixed up a drink in it then put it back on the counter and put the mixing tools back in it with out washing it or getting a new container. And then watching how the drinks were mad was pretty bad the bartender consistently under poured all the drinks. Overall it was a great experience except for the bar. And make sure you get there early enough or make a reservation it's a popular joint so expect to wait. I will absolutely be back when I come in to town again.",

We enjoyed a few happy hour beers for $3 to $5 depending on the beer. Then we did it, we went with the Whole Hog ($36). It included 4 types of meat and 3 sides. The highlights were the St. Louis ribs, the beef brisket, mac n cheese and the cole slaw. Way too much food for two, but my company was paying so let the sweats begin!   Service was friendly and the decor was inviting. The back room area, or I guess the club, was a bit sketchy but what club isn't at 5PM. Maybe that's where you find the cure for those sweats!",

Not only were we more than impressed, it's definitely now on the list of must-have BBQ, even if it is a 45 minute drive away from us!  First off, I was looking forward to the cornbread since so many people have commented on it.  It was right on par - I even caught my picky 8 year old licking his plate to get all of the crumbs, which is a first.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese, my husband had the sausage and brisket with mac and cheese and fries and my son ordered the mac and cheese as his entire meal (notice a theme).  Soooo many people have commented on their mac that I made sure to mention it and we all ended up ordering it and loved it.  Even though it was absolutely fantastic, that wasn't the highlight.  My pulled pork sandwich was the best I have ever had and I finished that thing off without it ever being put down.  The meat was fall-apart tender and the sauce was a perfect blend of flavors for me (oh look, now I'm salivating again).  My husband loved his sausage and brisket and is already working on figuring out what he is going to order the next time.  Then there's the staff, everyone was extremely friendly and made you really feel welcome.  Our server (Victoria?) was very sweet and perfectly attentive.  Overall though, the place just really made you comfortable.  I would be remiss if i didn't mention the 'Thank Q's' doughnuts.  What a fun idea!  They are just the finishing touch on a great meal, great service and great experience!",

The hour and a half wait time given made us question for a minute but we decided to stay. Best choice ever! Only waited about 20 minutes and had one of the most amazing meals ever. Although they were packed, the service was great! In fact we decided to come back a week later on our way back home. We made a reservation this time but didn't really need it at 5:30 on a Monday evening. Food was still remarkable, Ashlynn was a wonderful server, and we cannot wait to go back again on our next trip through town.

One of three at the table thought them a tad greasy, Two of us did not. I had the three meat combo with Brisket, St Louis Ribs and Chicken. Mac and Cheese and fries. Was the meat the best I ever had? No, but it was dang good. My favorite of the three was the Brisket.  Shoestring fries are my favorite fries and what I opt for them when I can. I demolished the large pile they put on the plate. The Mac and Cheese tastes like it is made with that processed cheese food that starts with a V. I love that processed cheese food that starts with a V. I have had lots of different versions of mac and cheese with my BBQ across the US. They may have used a fancy blend of real cheeses, but in the end, the processed cheese food at Bobby's is right at the top of my fav list. Adult beverages are a bit pricey, but they are good and not watered down.  The service was great. Joe was our waiter. He was new but I would not have guessed until his supervisor came to the table.

Also, at the end of the meal, they bring you freshly-made, warm cinnamon-sugar donut holes to enjoy. It's a bit far out location-wise, especially if you are in the Tempe/Mesa area, but for the best BBQ in Arizona, it's worth the drive!",

    "text": "Okay, hard for me to give 5 stars to a casual restaurant but I totally agree with the overall Yelp rating that this place is 4.5 stars for food.  First time visit and have been meaning to go for 10 months since moving to PHX.  I got the Baby back ribs, potato salad & grilled veggies.  Ribs were great with little fat or gristle.  Pot. salad is awesome.  Two of my friends had the fried chicken (boneless) with chicken gravy.  I kept poaching their chicken, mac cheese and mashed potatoes. Corn bread is tasty but crumbles too easily for me.  Desserts were good.    Definitely will be going back this summer a few times to this place.  I was in NC on vacation two weeks ago and ate at two BBQ places and they pale in comparison.",

Q rolls were yummy. Complimentary corn bread was delicious. Prime rib and ribs we ordered were so tender. Can't go wrong with any of the sides. All were tasty. Fresh hot Donuts are a nice treat at the end too! A+ in my book!!",

The first night i had the pulled pork with mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was amazing.  The second night i had the beef brisket and mac and cheese.  I cant remember the other side i had because the mac and cheese was that good.   On the first night after eating, we were given a complimentary desert, not sure the name of it, but it was amazing.  And then the little doughnuts were the next arrival.  They are hot and ohhh so good.  A great finish to a great meal.   I will go back again and send others to eat here.",

Everything from how its not in the same league as KC and TX Bbq and how it lacks flavor like bbq from those places. but I have to say that this place makes me wonder if they never ate here.  It is certainly not blue collar BBQ as its not cheap which means its food not everyone can enjoy. That is the magic of BBQ! I lacks that  \"wear the shirt you dont mind getting messy\" feel which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.   Otherwise the meat is expertly smoked (you can smell it on the drive in which is key), the flavors are amazing, ribs fall right off the bone and of you so much as breathe on the meat it falls appart for you.   The endless cornbread is really a nice selling point for me now as its so moist and yummy.   The waitress was very well versed on the menu and provided some excellent attention to us while we were dining.   The food was fantastic, the staff is very friendly, the setting is well enough for a special occasion. Its not your everyday neighborhood bbq joint but if you just got paid and want to celebrate a special occasion then this place will send you home with a full belly and a smile of your face.",

The corn bread was great and unlimited although we only needed one basket with our q rolls and meals. We ordered the pulled pork sandwiches with potato salad and mac n cheese on the side and my son had the ribs. I have to say I would probably get the ribs next time as well, the sandwich was ok but the sides we couldn't get enough of!  By the end my son could barely fit his complimentary birthday dessert! Our server was absolutely wonderful and while we felt the food was pretty good the service we received was truly amazing and the best we've ever had. We will be coming here for many more special occasions :)",

Nice and moist, but the only seasoning was the sauce (sauce was good...sweet Carolina style).  Needless to say I drenched the meat in sauce.  Overall, I found the meats to be smokeless and pretty bland.   2. Ribs - See above.  3. Cornbread - Very tasty sweet cornbread.  My favorite.  4.Mashed Potatoes - They nailed this side dish.  Smooth and creamy, with a peppery overtone.  I wish I would have just ordered a plate of this as my meal.  5. Grilled Corn - Tasted more \"burned\" than \"grilled\".  I didn't even finish it (which is unheard of since I often think about the kids starving in Ethiopia).  6. Frosted Lemonade - I think I had 4 glasses before I passed out from sugar overdose.  These things are REALLY good!  6. Dessert donuts - tasty, need more of these.  7.  Service - Excellent, no complaints here.  Overall, I wouldn't advise against going, I just wouldn't go out of my way to make the trip out there.  The meats were IMO very unremarkable.",

We were in the mood for bbq one recent Saturday night and the place we wanted to try only stayed open until 7, so we found this place on yelp and decided with so many great reviews, we should give it a try.   Let's just say the cornbread was the highlight of the meal and I've had better cornbread. We ordered the Three Meat Combo and chose the St. Louis Style Ribs (they were out of the Baby Back Ribs), the brisket and the pulled pork. For our sides, we got the mac & cheese and the ranch style beans. The beans were good and the ribs were just ok. The mac & cheese was definitely not up to par. The brisket had so much fat on it, it wasn't even edible and I had to drown the pulled pork in bbq sauce to eat it.  Minutes after we were given our food, they asked if we wanted boxes, and then came back a few minutes later and did the same thing. Not good service. Also - I was excited about the free mini donuts they give you to go. But - they're so bad, they're not even worth eating.  Pretty sure we won't be coming back here.",

Hubby and I shared the 2 rib platter (St.Louis and beef) with 2 sides - cole slaw and roasted corn. Fall-off-the bone meat, tender and moist, smoked but no overwhelming \"smoky\" taste, delicious corn bread that we asked for more! Our server, Carissa was fantastic. The manager on duty came to each table greeting customers. Top that!",

However, I took my $300 leather shoes to to get cleaned, and the oil from the ketchup and left a big stain in the leather.   I called the restaurant to speak to a manager. No return call. I drove back up to the restaurant to speak to a manager, a week later. She GM wasn't in, and the Asst. Manager said she has no authority to do anything. (Well why are you an Asst. Mngr).

I have a thing for their cornbread and dude hooked us up. So we pay and leave...and when we get outside, car trouble. I go to ask if it would be possible to leave it until the morning because no matter what we do, we can't get it started.

    "text": "Bobby Q BBQ. Clever. The restaurant had me at the name but it didn't hurt that they made Yelps 100 places to eat list. What does one do when they find themselves in Phoenix for the first time ever? Head over to Bobbie Q, of course. I came here for one reason and one reason only. Baby back ribs. I do love my baby backs. There is a pretty large parking lot to fit all the hungry BBQ lovers in one place. As I walked in and smelled the smoky goodness, the hostess in the front handed my party of three a bag of freshly made cinnamon sugar donuts while we waited a few short minutes for a table. Like a child who's been offered desert before dinner, I gleefully followed the hostess to our table whilst munching on my sugary donuts. Our waiter took our drink orders and I decided on the baby backs with a side of potato salad and mac and cheese.   After what seemed like a forever of eyeing and sniffing my neighbors meals, our plates came out. The full rack of baby backs were huge. The photo does not do it justice. Talk about a bang for your buck! They smelled amazing as the smokey aroma filled my lungs. I went in with my knife and realized how easy the cut was. There is hours of love put into these ribs because the first bite just melted in my mouth. The best thing about these ribs...they are not overly sauced. You can ask for extra BBQ and add as needed, but the meat is not masked with sauce. I got through about half of the tender rack of ribs before I realized that I still had two bowls piled high with mac and cheese and potato salad. I used the complimentary corn bread with butter to create potato salad and mac and cheese sammies and inhaled my sides. The mac and cheese was so creamy with a distinct sharp cheddar flavor. I wish that the cheese was a little more gooey than creamy, but the flavors where there. The potato salad had good flavor and great textures. It paired really well with the sweet cornbread. Heads up, this place won't do you well if you are on the diet. This is one cheat meal you will not regret.   The service was pretty impressive. Our waiter gave suggestions and replaced our drinks with new ones before we finished the original. Our food was served hot and when we were tipping over from being too full, he brought out to go boxes to pile our leftovers in. One of the managers was walking around in the restaurant and checking on tables throughout our meal. We gave kudos to the chef when he asked us about our experience. I didn't imagine Phoenix to be known for BBQ, but I was not disappointed with what I got. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating (with a sprinkling cooling system) with big enough tables to feel at ease. As I walked out, another bag of cinnamon donuts were handed to me and I vouched to be back. 5/5 overall experience!",

    "text": "Do you want great, smoky brisket, but to order off of laminated menus handed to you by impeccably polite servers? Do you want authentic ribs, but not want to get your hands dirty? Are you curious about BBQ, but aren't sure if it's still conceptually owned by Confederates?  Do you prefer your pork sandwich in a dimly lit museum-lodge instead of at a splintery wooden table outside? Do you wish you were at Hillstone?   Then Bobby Q is the spot for you! It's giant, civilized, organized, sexy, and capable of hosting massive private parties! It has no trace of the down home, no frill, authentic, dirty, traditional BBQ sentiment I love. Bobby Q combines two culinary traditions (Southern barbecue meets steakhouse vibe) without much organic intersection, providing a nice way for the bourgeoisie to enjoy BBQ, sans flies/plastic cutlery. The food is good, but the hike in price for out-of-place frilliness? Call me a stickler, or a hick, or a hickler, but the glamification of this otherwise humbly glorious cuisine doesn't quite move me.",

I must admit, their ribs were delicious and fall off the bones kinda thing but I'm not sure why he LOVES IT SO MUCH. He said it's the best ribs outta all the places that we've been to. Like Phils in San Diego. Or Everest Jones in Oakland. The sauce wasn't bad at all actually. It's not as sour compared to Phils BBQ. If you don't eat much, one full rack is good enough for 2. I thought it would be typical TGIFs or Claim Jumper or BJs ribs but it was much better than that! Well done with smoking the ribs because it wasn't that burnt like most places. I loveee their french fries, the skinny type! Delicioussss.   Lovely service so that was 2 thumbs up! It's nice to sit outside the patio but be careful with mosquito bites!  We came early that day so it wasn't too crowded but it will be after 6P.M. You get free donuts after you get the bill which is nice! Lastly, check in for 10% off your bill!",

Was our first time there and he went through all the menu options from appetizers to main course.  The appetizers were excellent.  We shared a plate of St Louis and Baby Back Ribs along with Brisket and Roasted Chicken.  Incredible!  Cooked perfectly and so tasty!!  Ribs were meaty, tender.  I had a dinner salad with Blue Cheese dressing.  The lettuce was crisp and the dressing was very good.  The sides dishes were also perfect.  We had Mac and Cheese, mashed potatoes and green vegetables.  Everything was so, SO GOOD!  There's usually something that just ok...at any restaurant but not last night!  The portions were HUGE and every bite was equally delicious.  I almost forgot about the corn bread and corn off the cob.  Both so fresh and tasty!  We shared a sampler entree and we were so full.  If that's not enough, they bring you a small bag of fresh doughnuts with sugar/cinnamon.  Said I was too full but the Manager twisted my arm and convinced me that I had room for one!  Absolutely delicious!!    I highly recommend this place.  Make sure to go there hungry!!",

Best of all tony gave me good recommendations and made sure my meal was epic. I'm sorry to report he succeeded.  The food was fabulous. I got the 3 meat combo and of that the baby back ribs were my favorite. The chicken was fantastic and the beef brisket was great but hats off to anyone that can cook a pig that good! The grilled veggies were tastie and made me feel better about eating here. The beans were also great.  The sauces were also very tasty. I highly recommend the spicy to anyone who wants a zip to their sauce. All in all a great last meal in AZ before going back to Cali",

It was delicious.   Also we got the whole hog heaven. Comes with 2 rib choices, 2 meats, & 3 sides. We we got the baby back ribs & St. Louis ribs. They are both good the only difference is the St. Louis ribs taste more smokey. The meats we got both chicken rotisserie. The sides we got were mash potatoes, garden vegetables & fries. There were a lot of fries. The veggies were huge. The meats, were good & ribs.   After you order your food they bring you corn bread with butter. It's delicious and sweet. Also after your meal they bring you complementary donuts they tasted like cinnamon to me but for my more they tasted like lemons.",

    "text": "QUICKIE REVIEW Come on in here and get some of this smoked BBQ goodness.  FOOD This is what I tried: -Q-rolls -Whole hog heaven  This place couldn't help but to knock it out the park right from the start.  The cornbread they give you does not need butter or anything extra added to it.  Just enjoy as is.  Then the Q-rolls, soft crispy outside with brisket that melts in your mouth on the inside.  Then came time for whole hog heaven. Wow, just wow.  Warning, this is going to be a LOT of food.   It can definitely feed two and maybe an additional two depending on how hearty the eaters are.  For the ribs, I recommend people try the St. Louis style (server can explain what it is) and nothing else.  You are supposed to pick two ribs, I am saying make that both your options.  Same thing for the two meats, make them both beef brisket.  In with all of the meat I had there it was smoked to perfection and if there a bone involved, meat fell right off of it.  Everything really seemed to just melt in your mouth if it did not already do so in your hand from being so soft and tender.     PARKING They have a whole parking lot that they own.  No shortage of parking.  SERVICE Our waiter was good to go.  He was the one to recommend the Q-rolls and gave us the broke down of everything else.  Service was prompt and polite as it should be.  PRICE For two, everything was under a $100.  To which I want to add I ate it later for dinner and breakfast the next day.   TIP/OTHER THOUGHTS When you are done with the meal and are leaving, they give you these heavenly donuts fried in peanut oil.   Man oh man.  Yes, just yes.",

Loved the baby baby ribs and pecan cole slaw. One friend was not hungry for dinner so she ordered dessert only. She said that bread pudding was superb,  the best she's ever had.  We are very particular about our bread pudding. I've had terrible bread pudding at casino buffets but also good bread pudding at Lola's A Louisiana Kitchen. My sister loves the bread pudding at Famous Dave's Barbecue. So we now know where to get some great bread pudding. I love that the meat is smoked at least 22 hours. BbQ done correctly.  Bob himself also came by our table to greet us / meet us. Nice fellow! Wishing you continued success,  sir!",

    "text": "I drove all the way from Los Angeles to see a concert at Ak Chin Pavilion yesterday, but I had to scan Phoenix to find a special restaurant to try since it's not every day I will be in the area. Needless to say, I found what I was looking for and it exceeded every expectation.  First off, the atmosphere is very much like a roadhouse and I dig the individual lamps over each table. Sharli, my waitress, was very friendly, talkative and attentive to both me and my friend. She answered every question of mine with a lot of detail and built up the food even more, because I wasn't already hyped up enough.   Now for the food! Let me begin by saying how amazing the cornbread was. With it's slightly crusty outside, mildly crumbly yet soft center and buttery melt in your mouth flavor I can honestly say it was as close to perfect as you can get. I ordered the 3 meat combo with brisket, baby back ribs, smoked sausage, mac n cheese, baked beans and an additional side of hickory smoked mesquite veggies. Every single bite of this meal was heavenly. The brisket was like butter. It was so tender and full of flavor. The ribs were cooked to perfection. I could not even pull out a bone with any real amount of meat on it. The bones just slid out and the flavor put me on cloud nine. The sausage was very smoky and just bursting with flavor. It had that nice snap when you bite into it. Assuring you that this sausage is the real deal. The baked beans were very flavorful and the little tidbits of brisket inside just amplified the falvor even more. The mesquite veggies made me want all of my veggies prepared like this. My vegan sister would go nuts for these! Last, but most certainly not least, the mac n cheese would satisfy any king or god on any planet and in any galaxy. The cheesiness and creaminess balance was absolutely on point and it blew every other mac n cheese I have ever had out of the water.  Needless to say, this was one of the best meals I have ever had. Every single 5 star review is justified. If you love bbq, or just amazing food in general, you owe it to yourself to come here if you are anywhere near Phoenix.   One last thing, they give you free mini donuts with your check! They, like everything else I ate, were super yummy!",

The chicken is good, but I'm all about the ribs! We ordered both the baby back and St. Louis and both are highly recommended.  The only downside is the size of the sides. They're incredibly small!

    "text": "I have to admit that I love the smoked meats at BobbyQ.  They are as close as I've had to real smoked brisket since I lived in Texas.  The cornbread is good and always comes with your meal.  Don't forget the mini doughnuts like you would get at the state fair that they bring with your final bill.  Sometimes the wait staff doesn't seem to know how to deliver great service and what is up with putting ice in the urinals?  It doesn't seem sanitary to do this, but the bathrooms are always clean, it's just the ice in the toilet is weird.  I would defiantly recommend this place to anyone for a beer or wine and smoked meats.  One of the best in Phoenix that's for sure!",

So we just happen to be near Bobby Q and it was past lunch time, made a last minute decision eat here. Besides we haven't been here in a while. We didn't have to wait long to be seated since the lunch crowd was gone. We were seated by Arianna, our server and soon after we were seated she handed us our menu. Since it was not dinner yet and after lunch, I decided to go for a smaller meal. I went for the Sliced BBQ Prime Beef Brisket sandwich and I chose the baked potato as my side with all the fixings. As we were waiting for our orders cornbread was placed at our table with soft butter to spread in the cornbread. They were delicious to say the least. My dish was brought out and it was all I could do to stop focusing on my Brisket sandwich. Let me tell you I was not disappointed with my dish. Everything was cooked to perfection and by the time I was done I had eaten every morsel of goodness. I must of been hungry but, it was the way everything was prepared. I will return and try something different next time.  As a jester of advice, whenever you check in to Bobby Q or other restaurants that offer a discount on your check in, tell your server and show them, so that you are given the discount.",

I ordered their 2 meat plate option that comes with 2 sides. I picked their rotisserie chicken and beef brisket along with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious! I even had some leftovers to take home.   Afterwards we were given a bag of doughnuts!  I can see myself coming back!",

    "text": "Sunday afternoon the 4 of us arrived at Bobby Q. My elderly Aunt and her older sister and another friend makeup our dinner group. We were greeted and seated right away. There were two walkers in the group but no problem as the aisles were plenty wide and there was room to store them nearby.  Ashely was our server and while she was taking our beverage orders I mentioned \"Yelp\" for our discount, very nice! She also gave us seperate checks without a complaint,a very professional and a delightful person.  My Aunts had never heard of Yelp and thought they would have to exclaim \"yelp\"! to get the discount, very funny!!  I orderd the onion block which arrived quickly, the only better one we had tasted was the one from Tona Roma's now closed on Bell Rd.  I ordered the St Louis Ribs and they were sensational. I have had ribs all over and the \"smokey\" quality was the best and the amount of sauce perfect. The fact that they were hanging off the platter was very nice as well. My sides were a baked potato and grilled vegetables. The potato was large and piping hot, I \"hot potatoed\" myself twice, just the way I like. The veges were generous and delicious.  Two of the ladies orderd the Baby Backs Ribs and the comments were very positive. They ordered a variety of sides which were all well received.   One misstep was that a side of Mac and Cheese was received instead of the Pecan Slaw. No problem, the young man who brought out the plates returned with the desired slaw and more of the popular corn bread within a minute.  All in all, a great meal! All of us took heavy boxes home and the \"Thank You\" donuts were cute.",

    "text": "As we neared Bobby Q's from the rear entrance in the dark, my wife and I had to assume it was the popular bbq place by the glowing Christmas-style lights adorned on the roof and beer signs on the side of the roadhouse-inspired building, as there aren't any signs to notify potential customers of it's presence from that entrance.  Upon nearing the building on foot, I was impressed with all of the outside seating available, complete with an outside bar and several TV's.  We were promptly seated, as it didn't appear very busy for a Saturday evening.  The hostess and waitress were very friendly and knowledgeable.  Soon after ordering our drinks, we were given two pieces of cornbread, which were tasty and not just regular square, dry cornbread that comes from the box.  Soon after we each ate a piece of cornbread and had consumed some our drinks, we couldn't believe it when our order arrived so quickly!  (I've had to wait much longer at Dairy Queen for food).  I got a half rack of St Louis-style ribs, which were very good, but a little more expensive than other places charge, but worth it for the quality of service and cleanliness of the restaurant.  The macaroni and cheese didn't disappoint us. It was very cheesy and pleasing to the taste buds. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they give a ten percent discount when you check-in there on yelp, which is always an added incentive.  After finishing our meal, we were given a couple of \"Thank Q's,\"  which are their freshly made small doughnuts that are a nice little complimentary dessert.  Overall, I was impressed with the restaurant and plan on returning there.  I would definitely recommend it to friends, or anyone who wants to have a good time with a large party.",

The patio is much like a garden patio at a home with brick walls and plants high enough to block the traffic / side street noises.  The indoors has a rustic, yet, elligant patio feel to it with the brick walls and rustic wood ceilings.  The furniture is again, more of a patio feel than a typical bar-b-que restaurant.  The noise level was not too loud that you couldn't hear people at your own table.   The food was wonderful! Although my husband said their burger was too greasy, that was the only downfall.  My brother and I had the St. Louis ribs.  The way they caramelize the bar-b-que sauce on the ribs is great. They aren't runny with sauce dripping down your hand. The rib meat falls off the bone and easy enough to eat with a fork or picking it up.   The sides were great. I had the macaroni and cheese which was definitely homemade. Not runny and not too dry. The cheese flavor was not too strong either.    I would  be prepared to wait a bit for a table because they appeared to always be busy. Overall, I really enjoyed this place and would go back again!",

    "text": "As a lover of BBQ, I cannot believe it took me 6 years of living in Arizona to find this gem. My girlfriend and I went here after much anticipation on a Sunday afternoon and we were blown away. This is not only THE best BBQ you can get in Arizona, but the service and ambiance are second to none.   We shared the Whole Hog feast and had enough left over for a late night snack. The cornbread was the most amazing, moist, sweet corn cake I have tasted. Beef ribs?  Amazing, tender, juicy, beefy. Baby Backs? Fall off the bone and meaty, Pulled Pork? Juicy, smokey, melt in your mouth. Brisket? Full of sweet smoke and seasoning. I got an order of burnt ends to take home and the knocked my socks of with the seasoning and smoke - YUM!!!  The manager came by our table and chatted with us for a bit about our meal. She gave us a little history on how Booby Q's came to be. Later, our server came by and informed us we could pick any dessert we wanted - compliments of the manager. We picked the mud pie - again THE best I've ever had. At this point in the meal we were not surprised by the amazing-ness of the dessert. Wow! Hard to find service and attention to the customer like that anymore.   All in all this is now in my top 3 favorite places to not just eat, but to dine in Arizona. In my opinion, a 5-star dining experience should cater to all 5 senses - Bobby Q's did just that. If I could give a bonus star, I would. If you have not been to this restaurant, stop searching Yelp right now and make plans to go. You will NOT be disappointed.",

The fiance loved the Q-rolls but they weren't my jam. We shared the 3 meats combo. They were out of sausage so we split the brisket, pork (my favorite), and ribs (his favorite).  It was so nice of them to provide us with 2 plates with all of the meats split so we could sample everything. I also tried the mango margarita which was fabulous and the perfect bite and sweetness. I loved the creaminess of the mac but the fiance wasn't too impressed. Shoestings delivered but were nothing special. Overall, I was very happy and we left with leftovers. The churro spiced light donuts were also fabulous. I just love the feel of this place.",

    "text": "I've driven by this spot so many times on the 17 and finally decided to look it up on yelp.  Based on the mostly rave reviews my boyfriend and I decided to give it a shot.  First off I was really excited about the mac n cheese since so many people said it was amazing.  I was severely disappointed and agree with another reviewer who said it tasted like velveeta.  I'm convinced that's exactly what it was.  The beans tasted like watered down canned baked beans.  Okay, now that the bad is out of the way let me tell you about the good.  We ordered the Q rolls as recommended and we weren't disappointed.  Both sauces were tasty.  We couldn't decide on what to get so we went with hog heaven to try a bit of everything.  We chose the St. Louis ribs, the beef ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.  Our sides were mac n cheese, beans, and roasted corn.  We had to ask for cornbread.  The cornbread was good, on the caky side but still good.  The roasted corn was very good, I recommend it.  The brisket and pulled pork were definitely up to par.  I grew up on both.  They weren't quite my dad's, but still worthy of recommendation.  Both ribs were fall off the bone.  I hadn't has St. Louis ribs before and I wont get them again.  They were on the spicy side, which I personally don't prefer.  The beef ribs were very tasty and I would order them again.  After waiting for some boxes we started to look around at the other tables.  The baked potatoes look awesome, stuffed to the hilt of goodness.  They also had vegetables.  No mac n cheese or beans in sight.  We'll definitely follow suit next time.  All in all we were pleased with the experience.  The main food was done right and the restaurant and atmosphere was great.  The service was definitely to our liking.  The 10% off from yelp was also a bonus :)  We are both huge fans of honey bears and their sauce, although as of late the ribs haven't been fall off the bone.  We are considering buying honey bears' sauce and getting Bobby Q's beef ribs to go without the sauce.",

I had first thought of ordering the whole hog heaven but didn't think there would be enough for four so we each ordered individual meals. I had the soup and slider. I had the baked potato soup with a brisket slider. The soup was good not as thick as  others I have tried and the slider was awesome. The roll was nicely toasted and a good portion of brisket. I should have asked for extra sauce as my sandwich went dry halfway through.  My family ordered the the catfish po boy kids chicken finger,jumbo bbq potato,sampler platter and a brisket platter. The only complaint we had was on the brisket platter.... Small potion for the pride. Overall there was a vote at the table on how bobby q fared against another famous bbq place and the results were... Cornbread... Bobby q.... Mac n cheese ... FD.... Tea... Bobby q... Brisket .... Split soup Bobby q and fries split. Overall for a family of six we would probably go back to the famous platter of meats and fixings but I enjoyed the service and food today at Bobby Q's.",

I found this place on Yelp and came here while on a trip to Arizona.  The place was pretty crowded but we only  waited about 15-20 minutes.  We ordered babyback ribs, St. Louis ribs, corn, and mac&cheese.  They also give you DELICIOUS AMAZING CORNBREAD!  Everything was excellent.  The St. Louis ribs were the best ribs I have ever had.  They were extremely tender and had a nice flavorful bark on the  outside with dark grill marks.  Their BBQ sauce was equally awesome and the kind I like -- a bit more on the sweeter side, less on the vinegary side.  The babyback ribs were also tasty, but not as flavorful (and less meat of course) than the St. Louis ones.  The sides were good but more forgettable due to the sheer perfection of their ribs.  I don't know if I will ever be in Phoenix again, but this place is a must-return if I ever am.  Oh and at the end of the meal, they gave us complimentary, piping hot FRESH cinnamon donuts!  That double-won me over.  I want Bobby Q right now.",

We had the Q-rolls which were like large taquitos with the tenderest brisket inside.   You get 6 and it is large enough for a meal. We also shared the lunch combo plate with baby back ribs, St. Louis ribs, and pulled chicken. It is obvious they don't boil their ribs like other places. They claim to slow smoke them for at least 18 hours and I believe it. We had the Mac and cheese for a side and it was creamy and the noodles were just right and not mushy. The only thing I wasn't thrilled with was the banana cream pie. It was tasty and the crust was delicious, but the consistency was odd. I highly recommend this place for BBQ.",

I have had their burger to their plates and everything in between.  My favorite entree to order is the two meat plate combo where I get pulled pork and brisket with mashed potatoes and coleslaw on the side.  The mac-n-cheese, french fries, coleslaw, BBQ beans, and mashed potatoes are all excellent sides that are executed well.  The food is just really good here the meat is very tender and moist; and together with their BBQ sauce is the ultimate.  The atmosphere is very pleasant and inviting.  The service has been pretty good, but I have had some waiters that have been less than ideal.  I hate to spoil the surprise but they give these melt-in-your-mouth cinnamon sugar donuts as a nice little treat when you receive your check as a thank you.  Overall, if you are looking for a nice sit down BBQ restaurant with great food I would highly recommend you give this place a try.",

The hostesses were a bit chatty with each other and I decided to not wait for them to finish their conversation and went to the bar area to get food.  The bartender was a splendid and excellent waiter/host for us.  Great service all the way around.  They start with decent cornbread and then you have an extensive menu to choose something.  I do not know why people say this is a $$ place as it is $$$ to $$$$ depending what you order at a minimum overall.  This place is not cheap, however, it is worth giving it a whirl.  The salads were made exactly how we wanted them.  THe chicken was really moist for being a a breast.  The red potatoes are very good and the roasted corn have fantastic flavor.  To end dinner they give you some small beignets to eat.  So tasty and  nice way to end the meal.  The newer facility near the mall in PHX is MUCH nicer inside, however the food is consistant with quality and flavor.  Great place to go, however bring your wallett  :)",

Man, that was one DELICIOUS chicken with two sides of potato and grilled veggies. They also give a complimentary ice cream cake slice for the birthday person & yes, they do sing for them too haha. I loved this place and their service. It was very packed on a Wednesday afternoon so I highly recommend setting up a reservation like we did. We were attended right away becuse of outbreservations when other parties had to wait 25 to 30 minutes to be seated.",

We even received a 10% discount for checking in thru yelp.  Our meal started with delicious complimentary cornbread. I don't think I have enough words to describe how delicious ALL the food that we ordered specially the BRISKET and Chicken BBQ! Bobby Q exceeded our expectations! They also have generous portion its good for sharing and worth every buck! HIGHLY recommended for your BBQ cravings!",

We have tried many items on the menu but my favorites are the q rolls with the chipotle ranch dip as an appetizer. We also like the onion stack. The cornbread they give you is so good as well. My favorite entree is the brisket. It is very flavorful. The best side is hands down the Mac and cheese. It is so creamy and delicious.   They also have a great selection of beer, wine and cocktails.   When you are about to leave you get a bag of freshly made donuts in a brown paper bag. I'm usually stuffed but have to eat one hot then take the rest home.",

My spouse had the ribs and they were so moist and tender that they literally fell off the bone. My husband was so impressed and in love with those ribs. He also enjoyed the tender juicy brisket, potato salad and cornbread.   I had the chicken and have never had rotisserie chicken that moist. They do a great job with everything and also have a bar. Nice atmosphere as well. We're fans and will be back.",

Management is very visible and seem to spend a lot of time checking on there guests to ensure satisfaction.    We had the the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.  The fried chicken and gravy were excellent.  Good flavor all around and crispy crust on the chicken.  Chicken was moist and flavorful.  Gravy was also tasty and mashed potatoes were very good.  Mac and cheese was just ok. Not bad.  We also ordered the baby back ribs with a green salad and corn.  Baby back ribs were excellent fall off the bone, tender and juicy. The salad was very fresh, good size with tomatoes onions, cucumbers, croutons and homemade ranch dressing. Yum.  The only disappointment was the corn. It was mushy and swimming in greasy butter like sauce.  They need to change this one up.  Fresh corn on the cob with seasoned butter to the side would be a better option and a more worthy accompaniment to the rest of the delicious food.    Service was spot on throughout, but getting check closed out was a bit slow, but not much to complain  about.  All in all a pretty great experience.  We'll be back and excited that they will have a new location soon at 32nd and Camelback!",

Their outdoor seating is so cute, especially in the evening when they turn on the light fixtures. What I love is that you can come here for a casual lunch with a friend, come in for a meal with a group/family or for a casual dinner date with your beau. Most dress casual, others put on a cute dress if they're in the mood. Do you!   They're also extremely accommodating. On my second visit, we squeezed in a quick dinner before my flight. We were really TIGHT on time on a Friday night and when we arrived, we needed a table for six [ugh, we're jerks for showing up expecting a table, I know]. Anyways, there was a long list but my brother finagled a little bit and we managed to get seated in within 15 minutes.   There are several items on the menu that I think are worth your money: - Spinach Artichoke Queso Dip: YUM!!! My brother and I are crazy about this dip. It comes with some damn good garlic toast. Definitely one of my favorite appetizers ever.  - Baby Back Ribs: Can't go wrong with their Baby Backs! They fall right off the bone. *DROOLS* - Two Meat or Three Meat Combos: This allows you to pick from a variety of options including beef ribs, baby backs, St. Louis, Brisket, Pork, and more!   Can't forget to mention that all of their BBQ platters come with your choice of two sides, sauces and cornbread!   Can't wait to be back in Phoenix so I can have another meal here!",

But I do have one issue; ingredients need to be listed on some of their items, like desserts. I ordered a chocolate item and when it came to the table, they had included walnuts, which I'm allergic to. When I asked about a different chocolate item instead, I was told by the waitress that it had peanuts in it (which I'm not allergic to but I know many others are). They had to throw away my first dessert in the garbage and bring me something else.   Seems like a waste of money for a business, and a possible lawsuit too if someone went into anaphylactic shock. List the ingredients on the menu, or prompt the servers to ask the customers about food allergies.",

I'd definitely recommend this place(: And their cornbread is absolutely amazing! Light, fluffy and buttery (: Lastly, the service was magnificent (our waiter's name is Hunter) and we even got these cute (and delicious) donuts before we left.",

We got there and were instantly greeted and instantly seated! So far everything was fantastic! Our server, Carmela, came right over...and was super sweet, complete with great service through out our meal! I had a cup of baked potato soup which was good...not fabulous...but good. The corn bread, on the other hand, was amazing...not sure how they made it so perfectly...but I need it everyday! The brisket was excellent, the roni's and cheese was scrumptious! The shoestring fries...were shoestring fries...nothing special...but ultimately sides don't really matter! The portions were very generous, couldn't finish my meal...and I really wanted to! And then the little Thank Q donut holes were a nice, sweet little touch of dessert! Unfortunately, we live in CA, so we won't be able to come back...unless through some kismet, chance of serendipity we end up back at the second bbq heaven on earth!! If you live by here or find yourself at one of the nearby hotels, then by all means stop in for a great, hearty meal!",

The interior has a fine dining steak house feeling to it with a southwestern dining on the outside seating area.  A good family friendly restaurant.  Service: Definitely has a welcome feeling to it. Waiter was good, but the manager was better and more considerate.  Our food came out on a timely manner ...but when we ask for bbq sauces, it took a while.  However, the Sauces was worth waiting for....  Food: Complimentary cornbread was great! It was soft, moist, and had a cake texture. It would have been better if was hot instead of room temperature.  We order the artichoke appetizer... The bread stick was perfectly toasted with garlic herb butter, but the dip itself was too heavy cheesy.  As for the bbq... I wished it was hot.  It was lukewarm, but not hot enough to bring out the full bbq experience.  The meat was smoke very well that left no greasy fatty taste, but the sauces is the best part.  All the meats was overly cooked so it did not stay intact very well. In the end, everything tasted like pull pork.  Overall, because of the temperature of the food and the overcooked meats, I rated it as 3 stars.",

The hostess told us the wait would be 30 mins but it was less than that.   We were seated and our waiter was super friendly. We already looked over the menu when we were waiting so we ordered pull pork sandwich with mash potatoes and my friend ordered two combination: brisket and baby back ribs with Mac and cheese and shoe string fries. For dessert, we went with the sub zero banana. The food came out super fast! The portion sizes were huge too! We shared our plates and omg it was so delicious and flavorful! The meats just fell apart and was cooked to perfection! The mash potatoes went well with my pulled pork sandwich and it was creamy! Mac and cheese was very creamy too and so good. The shoestring fries was just normal fries. We thought it would have some kind of seasoning on it like garlic or something. Now for the dessert. I thought they should've put more bananas on it because it really brought out the flavors. The crust tasted like an oatmeal cookie. Overall, the dessert was just okay and nothing to get excited over. I def want to try their mudslide next time! But It got 5 stars because our server was fantastic and the food was delicious! It was so yummy that when the server and manager asked us how our food tasted....oh you bet you got my answer lol! Delicious!!!!",

The pulled pork and chicken are also delicious. As for the sides, the mac & cheese was good and creamy  but the baked beans and coleslaw were mediocre.

He recommended the corn bread to start then gave us suggestions for other appetizers. Q rolls were delicious along with the wings and chicken tenders. The manager Taylor went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. When we were finished they brought us sugar doughnuts that were the best. We sat outside on the patio that was spacious and held a lot of charm. I will definitely be back to visit with friends.",

All I can say is WOW! We arrived early on a Saturday to avoid the crowds and were seated as soon as we walked in. Our server, Hal (Harold), explained the menu, answered all of our questions and was very attentive throughout our meal. We were very impressed with everything from start to finish and will definitely be back. There are a lot of awesome pictures of the Bobby Q's plates on yelp, and it all looks so good. Also noticed a great sense of teamwork and pride by the entire staff. That means the management is doing their job and doing it well!",

Definitely worth the drive.  Also four function rooms for private and corp events.  Full carry out menu as well. Enter from southbound I-17 frontage road or 27th Ave.",

    "text": "I have to say that this is some of the best BBQ I have ever had! The price is very reasonable as well, especially for the amount of food you are given. The BF and I shared the \"Whole Hog\" platter. We finished it, but only because we're gluttons and don't believe in wasting food. It was enough for at least 3 people. The meat just fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. I also appreciate that it wasn't smothered in sauce. They give you the opportunity to actually taste the meat but give you extra sauce on the side if you want it. We had the mac and cheese - gooey and scrumptious and the corn - roasty. The cocktails were tasty and also reasonably priced. We were there on a Saturday night with a party of 14. I don't know if we had a reservation but we were seated pretty quickly. We could tell that they were busy and even though we were taking up a lot of precious space they never  made us feel rushed. The waitress was a doll! Being a large group we didn't all arrive at the same time, needed separate checks, and needed drinks at different times. She didn't miss a beat and everything was accurate on our bill. If you check in on Yelp you get 10% off that visit and you can register for their mailings on their website and they'll send you a coupon for a free onion block appetizer.  There is a club attached to the restaurant but it is pretty bizarro. I wouldn't recommend hanging out there after your dinner. It isn't a honky tonk but a CLUB club for the locals. It doesn't really fit with the restaurant but whatever more power to them using the space to make some money. Apparently every table in the club is sold out every Saturday night so good for them. I forgot the mention the donuts. If you are too full to eat them after your meal, as we were, take them with you! I sincerely regret not bringing them home to be eaten at a later time.",

    "text": "We drive by Bobby Q's all the time, and comment how so and so said it's good - we should try it. Well, we finally did.  Long time Phoenicians will remember this as the old Bobby McGees with costumed, singing waiters.  It's a rustic-looking, galavanized tin building with lots of tangled plants growing around it under what is one of the last stands of eucalyptus trees in the valley; it's cool - makes you feel like you are some place else.  I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in.  I didn't know what to expect, and the decor is more elegant than I would have expected, yet with shabby chic touches.  Some tables have chairs on one side and banquettes on the other - something different.  It's very pretty.  The menu is pretty standard for a barbeque place.  I went straight for the baby backs (half-rack, $16.00), my favorite.  Hubs ordered two meats ($17, I think) pulled pork and beef brisket.  Our waitress was nice, but a little unpolished, very valley-girl, yet helpful and attentive.  She plopped a basket with two round pieces of cornbread and whipped butter on our table - delish cornbread.  Beer comes with a frozen glass - a nice touch.   He ordered a wedge salad - generous helping of chunky blue cheese over ice berg lettuce with bacon and onion strings.    Sides are standard - shoestring fries that aren't really shoestring, beans, mac and cheese, pecan coleslaw that we almost tried.  We both got the fries and beans. Beans have a little bit of meat in them, and a bit of zip, but are nothing outstanding.  The ribs, however, were superb.  I put my fork in between rib one and two and the first bone basically fell on to my plate.  I had to nibble the meat off only a couple of the bones - other than that it melted off the bone.  The flavor was perfect - the meat flavor comes through the not too sweet, not too tart, smoky sauce.    Hubs thoroughly enjoyed his pork and beef as well.  The sides were so, so - we will try different ones next time.  We were too full for desert, but received two little - fritters or donuts (couldn't understand the valley-speak) in a paper bag to go.  Fished them out and ate them - little bits of heaven right there.  We will definitely be back for ribs.  It's a very pleasant, dressy casual restaurant and, a plus, it's on the west side!",

It looks like a dive bar on the outside but the inside has a very nice atmosphere. The tables are spacious, it's very clean, and they play good country music :) Even better, our waitress provided exceptional service.  I had the beef brisket sandwich with a side of macaroni and cheese. The beef brisket was so tender that it falls apart and the mac and cheese was an indulgence that was worth the calories! I enjoyed the spicy BBQ sauce on top of my sandwich. It has a nice kick but isn't too spicy that it takes away from the flavor of the brisket. My husband had a combo rib plate (baby back ribs & St. Louis ribs) which he enjoyed a lot. He liked the St. Louis ribs a bit more than the baby backs because they were meatier and not as marbled as he had expected. He also loved the mac & cheese and the garlic mashed potatoes. Would definitely recommend this restaurant.",

We thought, are we invisible?  We had never been treated like this before!  Tony one of the bartenders NEVER made eye contact with either myself or my husband once!  They were smashed busy full service bar also going to the kitchen to get us cornbread.  But when you first sit at a bar you would think the bartenders know to look up occasionally and greet the customers with at least \"We'll be right with you\"  Tony looked pissed and unhappy the entire time we were there.  The food is fantastic, my husband and I shared the full slab of baby back ribs with two sides: mac n. cheese and coleslaw, excellent with the extra spicy, hot sauce on the side!  Nice hot doughnut holes delivered to us after we were done!  We have eaten here couple times before and got takeout a couple of times when we went camping.  Spoiled our Saturday date night for a couple of retirees.  Hope it wasn't because I was Asian female and he was grey haired older man, kept thinking it was because of my race but not sure, Tony greeted and went right up to take care of a Black couple that sat down next to us.  Who knows, very sad, bothers me until today.  Never treated like the invisible couple before at a bar!",

Everything we've eaten here has been delicious, the services is exceptional, the prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is great too. My husband loves the Baby Back ribs and usually sticks to that. But I like try something different each time. On our most recent visit I had a Ribeye steak and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful. Our server, Lindsey, was very friendly, efficient, and accommodated all of our special requests. Our food was served quickly and exactly as ordered. We like to take our family and friend's to Bobby Q's too, because we know there will be something on the menu to please everyone. Bobby Q's is one of our favorite places for dining out.",

Our waitress, Chelsea, was a great server and she made us feel very welcome there. She never left us without anything we needed and was very polite!

Pulled pork and St. Louis ribs were outstanding!!!  So well smoked and tender!  Macaroni and cheese was the creamiest I have ever had.  Brooke, our server, was superb.  Very attentive and helpful without being a nuisance.  I highly recommend this restaurant, and have already started telling everyone I know just how excited I was with this barbecue!",

Great food...some of the best BBQ we've ever had.  Brisket rolls (Q rolls) as appetizer were fantastic.  We got the family deal for $28 on a Sunday and we had plenty of leftovers.  Cinnamon Sugar donuts (free) for desserts were a hit.    Service was fast and friendly.  We were seated quickly and all of our food and drinks ordered came to the table fast.  Decor is perfect - rustic but a little  upscale.  Highly recommend doing reservations off their website before going - there was a big wait by the time we walked out on a Sunday.  If we could give 6 stars we would - best restaurant experience we've had in years!!!",

    "text": "A coworker of mine highly recommended this place last year when I told him I was headed out to Tempe for spring training. I didn't get a chance to come last year but I made it a point to check it out this year. I was able to make a same day reservation for Saturday evening through the yelp app and I'm so glad I did because the wait was going to be about an hour otherwise. We waited less than 10 minutes to be seated.   Our server Tiffany was great, we told her it was our first time so she took the time to give us history on the restaurant and she gave us her recommendations. The corn bread was so yummy and moist. My fiance and I shared the whole hog heaven, which comes with two meats, two ribs and 3 sides. For $40 not bad at all, we didn't finish our ribs and meat (there was a lot for two.) The sides could have been a little bigger, we devoured the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were so creamy and flavorful.   I usually prefer baby back ribs over the St. Louis but in this case we agreed the St. Louis were better. The pulled chicken was my favorite, it wasn't the typical chicken covered in bbq sauce. It had some other flavor I can't describe but it was amazing! We walked out of here stuffed, I almost needed to be carried out. The home made donuts at the end were a nice touch, even though I was full I couldn't stop eating them because they were so light/fluffy and bite size. Definitely took advantage of the 10% for checking in. Saved us 10 bucks, I'll take it!! I'll be back next year when I'm in town.",

After reading the other reviews we decided to treat him and his roommate to some real food.  We were not disappointed.  We started with appetizers that were brisket filled Q-Rolls (A twist on the egg-roll).  All I could say was WOW/AMAZING. The platter we ordered included brisket that was so moist that it literally melted in your mouth.  The baby back ribs fell off the bone and the pulled pork and beef ribs were flavorful and cooked perfectly.  Best BBQ west of Kansas City. And the Mac and Cheese as a side, well...don't tell my mother (sorry Nana), but it was the best I'd ever had, and I've had a lot of mac and cheese in my day.  And the corn bread....The best corn-bread I have ever eaten, and I'm usually not a fan. I probably ate more than I should have, but hey \"when in Rome\".  My father (Apa) is a big BBQ fan and this will definitely be on the list of places to stop and eat at when we go back. Great service and ambiance as well.  The waiter and manager checked on us regularly and took care of us as if we were locals.",

They smoke their meat for 18 hours and you can see their chicken roasting from the dining room. They start you with some pretty good cornbread. For entrees we split the burger with bacon and bbq sauce and the pulled pork sandwich with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese... very healthy. The burger was tasty, not the most amazing burger ever, but solidly good. The pulled pork was better, definitely flavorful and good with their spicy bbq sauce. Both sides were pretty mediocre, I didn't like the mac and cheese...tasted like velveeta and the mashed potatoes were gluey. When we were done they brought out a little bag with a couple doughnut bites in it.... yum! I would come back here to try some more of their Q.",

I realize they bring out free cornbread when you get there, and free tiny doughnuts when you leave (both are really good) - but you come there for MEAT!

Since it happens to be just across the highway from my hotel I decided to try it.  I sat in the bar and the very friendly and outgoing bartender took my order for the combo rib plate which came as a half rack of baby backs and a half rack of Saint Louis ribs.  They were out of the beef ribs which I would have ordered over the baby backs which feel are over rated.  The ribs took less then 15 minutes from order to table. The plate was impressive and the ribs were excellent.Other then size of the bone I couldn't tell them apart.  For me general rule for ribs is that if they are \"falling off the bone\" they are over cooked. That was the case here, but the ribs were so tasty I was able to overlook that. They have two choices of BBQ sauce, spicy and mild...they were both similar in flavor with the spicy having a little more kick.  Overall the meal was excellent...I wish I had someone to enjoy it with. All in all 5 stars for food, service and atmosphere.  Next time I am going to try the smoked prime rib...sounds interesting.",

I'm sure the steaks and burgers are good, but if you want a steak you go to Dominick's; if you want a burger you go to In N Out; if you want ribs you go to this place.

    "text": "I was so excited to try this - Yelp rarely lets me down - but I was disappointed overall.    I give kudos to the host and waitress; both were very friendly, chatty, approachable.  My server gave me some background on the restaurant and made helpful suggestions.  I have high expectations when it comes to barbeque - juicy, lean brisket with a nice smoke ring, smoky chicken in a thick, tangy sauce, and the sides need to be out of this world.    Based on a recommendation, I ordered the two meat combo, brisket and pulled rotisserie chicken.  For sides I got the corn and a baked potato (not a traditional barbeque joint side necessarily, but it sounded good).  The brisket was soft, chewy, fatty - way too much so for my taste.  I was enjoying the chicken until I encountered a bone - that was the end of the chicken for me.  The corn was very tasty, and oh yeah - the cornbread - that was the best part of the meal!   In my opinion, the baked potato had been pulled from the oven about fifteen minutes too soon - it had yet to reach that fluffy potato interior that is so desirable about baked potatoes.    I sat outside; they have a lovely covered patio with various seating options and the ambiance was nice (if you don't mind birds flying around, very close to you).  Overall though, I can't get excited about this place and can't say that I would go back.",

We found Bobby Qs on Yelp and decided that it would be a fun and yummy place for dinner. We had made reservations in advance so we were seating as soon as we checked in. I had the brisket, which is melt in your mouth soooo delicious. My cousin had the loaded potato which was definitely loaded to the max! And my other cousins shared a combination plate which had more than enough food to feed two! They even had some leftover to take home! My fiance had the steak sandwich, which was good, but wasn't our favorite. The steak was not as tender as we'd like it to be. But our server, Jason F, went out of his way to make sure that we loved our food and made the situation much better. Honestly, even if the food was bad (which it wasn't!) I would have come back just for the service alone! We can't wait to head back!",

    "text": "Based on the recommendation of my peer yelper's, my wife and I tried this while in Phoenix. I have to say we were not disappointed at all. This was AMAZING!   Our server was Alexis and she did a really great job. Great positive energy and made us feel very welcome. She was on point with our food and follow up on our needs. Excellent customer service!!!  The appetizer we tried was the Q rolls which is a brisket spring roll with two sauces. They hit the spot and were super tasty. The cornbread was a nice touch as well with a little butter and then with the bean sides for the meal.   We ordered the Hog Heaven meal which the description states it is great for yourself or to share with someone else.....Hmmm no this is enough for you, your friend, and another friend lol.   I was expecting small portions so you get a taste. You get to pick two of the three rib styles. These are not just one or two ribs. You get a half rack of two different styles of ribs. Then you get three meat choices plus three sides. These are all regular portions not small mini portions.  I am a big guy and really enjoy BBQ. Between my wife and I we did not finish this meal there was enough left for a whole other meal.  The food is smoked on site and you can taste the nice smoke flavor in the meat which is tender and juicy. The ribs have a lot of meat on them with just a touch of crispiness on the outside. The meat was fall off the bone tender. The brisket was so moist and tender it was incredible. The sausage is absolutely home made! You can taste the difference in the sausage and texture. The chicken is super tender and again full of moisture even the chicken breast was juicy.   The pecan colesaw, ranch beans, and the mac & cheese were all super tasty sides!  If you are in the area I would highly recommend stopping and checking out some amazing BBQ.",

The beef ribs here were falling off the bone tender but relied way too much on the sauce and not enough on the smoke in the meat for flavor.  Overly sweet and no tangy heat that I expect on a good beef Q.  Like some odd mix of St. Louis style meets beef ribs.  I'd give them an 7/10.  And at $28 I'd expect a 10/10... Sides were hit and miss.  The whole corn was really exceptional - really a 10/10, great smoke flavor.  Slaw was ok but the pecans really didn't add and the slaw was lacking something 6/10.  Beans were good but again too sweet and not smokey 8/10.  My husband's brisket sandwich was pretty good but nothing outstanding.  He said 7/10.    Friendly, fast, professional service was still not enough to push this review up to a 5*.  Overall pretty good but I probably wouldn't bother to go again.  I'll save my Q quota for somewhere in Texas...",

We ordered the whole hog ($38) that comes with your choice of two orders of ribs and two orders of meat and three sides. We decided to order the St Louis Ribs, baby back ribs, pulled pork and brisket. The sides were two orders of Mac n cheese (since our kiddos love Mac n cheese) and corn.    Complimentary cornbread quickly arrived. Flatter than most corn breads it is packed with flavor. Tad oily but it was warm, moist and absolutely delicious.  As soon as we finished the bread our entrees arrived and we were shocked at the quantity. Could definitely feed 4 adults.  The St Louis Ribs...OMG! Yummy. Fall off the bone tender with excellent flavor. My boys who usually don't care for ribs ate half of the ribs.  The baby back was also delicious and less fatty. The pulled pork and brisket were also excellent although the ribs were definitely the highlight. Mac n cheese was incredibly creamy and perfect for the kiddos. Corn was a mix of slivers of Cobb and corn kernels in butter. Can't go wrong with that.  We couldn't finish our meal but that wasn't the end...they give you a brown bag labeled with \"thank q\" on it. Fresh hot, light and fluffy cinnamonny sugary goodness that tastes like fresh churros but with a mini donut texture.  10% off with check in only sweetens this place. Thanks Bobby Q for a delicious meal.",

Because it is not really obvious from the street, we overshot Bobby Q and had to do a turnaround in quite a sketchy strip mall a couple of blocks up. Half expecting a total dive we were pleasantly surprised to find the restaurant itself nicely appointed.  Before we even ordered our food a tasty basket of cornbread was brought to the table. We ordered a sampler plate containing 3 different meats - pulled pork, brisket and St. Louis ribs as well as a BBQ chicken sandwich. We couldn't decide on which sides to select but when our server brought us a sample of the mac & cheese to try our minds got made up in a hurry.  On the sampler plate the St. Louis ribs were terrific, the pulled pork was not too bad but the brisket was kind of dry. Fortunately the server had brought large containers of 2 types of BBQ sauce to our table so we were able to moisten the brisket with the sauce. The chicken on the sandwich was moist but I found the sauce a little too mild and sweet.  The service we received was friendly and attentive and the little doughnuts in the to-go bag was a nice touch.  Overall, worth a repeat visit if we are in the area. 3.5 stars.",

Sides were also amazing (mac n cheese to die for; seasonal veggies grilled with a perfect hint of smokiness). The corn bread wasn't quite as solid and buttery as we remembered from two and a half years ago, but service made up for that, and they had sent us home both times with with our doggie bags and complementary mini donuts to go :) This is definitely one of our favorite restaurants in Phoenix, and we will look forward to coming back when we are in the Phoenix area again.",

    "text": "Ordered the Combination of Half a Slab of Baby Back Ribs and Catfish, along with Baked Potato,  Mac and Cheese and Roasted Corn. Quite a complete meal that we shared it among 2 people and still could not eat all of it. The Baby Back Ribs were super tender and moist and as a cut each rib, the meat would just fall off the bone. The Catfish was good, would have been nice with some tarter sauce. The sides were average, not great, but not bad. The baked potato was loaded with butter, sour cream, chives and Bacon so that was a winner, the mac and cheese was good but when the waitress said that is their recommendation and the best side, I expected a little more. The Roasted Corn when we ordered expected a ear of corn roasted over a grill, but what we received was an inch of 2 ends of corn on the cob and loose corn kernels in a small bowl which could have been corn from a can.  Salmon Dinner was a generous slab of fish and was well prepared. It was grilled and had a good crisp grilled skin which was very good and it came with 2 sides which my daughter choose the mac and cheese plus vegetables.   Cornbread is very good and the waiter was generous enough to give us another basket.   At the end if your meal, wait for the sugar donuts! Served warm they are killer!  Overall experience was very good with service and ability to park while restaurant was busy.",

The meats were tender, moist and the sides complimented the meat really well.  The 4 Stars is for the fact that I had to get up and find our Server to ask for more BBQ Sauce because the sandwiches were served with barely a touch of sauce.   The bag of To-Go Doughnuts they give you at the end of the meal would of jumped our overall Review Score to 4 1/2 Stars, but Yelp doesn't give you that option.",

Went around noon on a Saturday and it wasn't too too packed. There's a nice outdoor area with lights and a fountain of sorts. (would try to avoid the back - sometimes there's one or tow more flies flying around).   We got the hogs heaven (a family style mix and match) and got the brisket, St Louis ribs, pork and ribs with a couple of sides. And wow it was amazing. Everything is so delicious and just melts in your mouth. The bbq sauce great too. Neither bland nor too sweet.   On top of it, the service was amazing. Our server was especially nice and took care of us well. Even if she were busy, she'd send another server to check in on us. This place is definitely  a must try.",

We chose Bobby Q's because the reviews were solid and we love bbq! If you're not paying attention in finding this place, good luck. Their sign is about 4x4 in size. The parking lot was packed which is a good indication. We chose to sit outside in the patio to avoid the wait time. Patio heaters were a plus. The menu is lengthy from ribs, chicken, brisket and all the fixns. We were served hot corn bread which was outstanding. My wife ordered the half chicken with baked potato and roasted corn. I ordered the brisket with the baked potato and baked beans. No need for a knife. The brisket was so tender I used my fork. Only minor drawback is that my food could've been a lot hotter. So if your in Phoenix, visit this place. And if you're in San Diego, visit Phil's bbq! No other place holds a candle to Phil's!",

I really enjoy the meat here but was very disappointed when we ordered a selection of pork ribs, brisket and beef ribs for a trip to Utah. We wanted some good food while hiking the parks. Everything was great except the beef ribs. We got 6 ribs with NO MEAT. I mean literally NO MEAT just smoked bones. If you ever had smoked beef ribs you know that there is a solid 3/4 to 1 inch thick strip of meat on the top side of the rib. The ones from here were stripped to the bone with only a little meat on the side. They ended up being expensive dog treats. everything else was great. DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON BEEF RIBS.  Always great service and drinks.",

Q-rolls were delicious as well as spinach artichoke queso. There was a bit of a mix up when finally seated  (much faster than 45 minutes quoted). No one notified server so took a bit before got assistance. For our inconvenience they comped an appetizer. (We still had drinks and appy from bar so truly didn't feel too inconvenienced, but I consider that great customer service.  Had the 3 meat combo brisket, baby back ribs and pulled pork. All were excellent but the brisket was a standout. Mac and cheese was very creamy and delicious, baked beans above average.  Will be back!",

I normaly love the ribs without bbq sauce, but their bbq sauce, Omg, adds sooo much flavor and nothing is too overpowering, the falvors are totally balanced, perfection!  For sides we ordered coleslaw(sooo good! Still thinking about that flavor mmm...),  potato salad(I prefer sweet potato  salad, but this one is great beacuse it will balance out the sweetness from the bbq),   corn(love this one as well, the smoking flavor is soooo addictive!)   and baked beans(loves their bbq sauce! Need I say more?)  Be sure to checkout this place when you in Phoenix!!!",

Ribs and brisket with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The best of the two in my opinion was be Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes were nothing spectacular. As far as the meat is concerned....Holy moly, this place has got to be one of the best bbq spots in Arizona. A bit pricey but worth it. The cornbread and little donuts are also amazing. I would come back here in a heartbeat! If you're in the mood for some good, finger licking bbq, this place is it! Also looks pretty lively inside on the weekends, check this place out if you're in the area, it won't disappoint!",

    "text": "Our last stop in Phoenix before returning to reality and I was craving some ribs, Bobby Q was a suggestion I'm so glad I opted to go for.   First of all the building itself is very southern style and includes a trough like waterfall on the back patio with a unique water fountain that is really fun.   While waiting to be seated I asked about a fryer like contraption which was for their COMPLIMENTARY churro like donuts and was surprised with two to start our dining experience!  Love that the manager himself sat us and attended to us a couple times, for customer service oriented was the impression I received, as well as the fact that everyone including our server introduced themselves.   Scott was kind enough to offer some suggestions as well as provide another COMP that being their cornbread muffins. O.M.G they are seriously worth the trip  in itself. Just a bit sweet and buttery with a slightly crisp top.   I ordered the St Louis style ribs with a side of spicy BBQ sauce and baked potato. They truly fell off the bone, super flavorful from the mesquite smoking and the sauce while not unique was very good. The baked potato was good, cooked just a bit too long, however hubby had the gravy which I used a bit for the potato and it was amazing. I suggest asking for the baked potato, if not going for mashed, to have with gravy.  Hubby had the fried chicken and side of fries with gravy on the side. The chicken was EXTREMELY moist and the batter once fried was light and crunchy. We have concluded however that unless it's KFC or a restaurant in the South we aren't going to get much flavor from the batter itself. However that's what the gravy is for and it was extremely good, I believe sausage based minus the actual meat. The shoestring fries were good but not specially seasoned like we get at our favorite Tucson BBQ joint.    We were going to order the mud pie for dessert however they were sadly out.   Truly amazing even with the minor drawbacks, I would done here monthly if we're in Phoenix..",

So since I have moved to Houston I went here as soon as I came home. For Texas to be known for BBQ I can say Bobby slays the majority of them with his cooking. Not only is all the meat good but the side dishes are out of this world.   We ordered the Whole hog heaven which is a BBQ lovers dream. We choose both Baby back ribs and St. Louis-TENDER FALL OF THE BONE  Brisket-Incredible but most importantly consistent. for all the years I have been coming it is always melt in your mouth incredible.  Chicken-So tender and smoky I die  Sides Mac and Cheese-Always so delicious although this time it was slightly off, I couldn't put my finger on it. I would like to believe it was just a bad batch, because its always so creamy and full of velvetta, YES.  Potato Salad-Perfectly seasoned too perfection, Served super cold and reminds you of summer.  Corn bread-From scratch moist and sweet. You could eat a pound of these.  BBQ Sauces-Hot and Reg-Thick, balanced and rich the only type of sauce that should be on BBQ. Think Sweet Baby Rays X10  Last the complimentary donuts- DO NOT MISS THESE TREASURES.",

    "text": "Wow...  I'm from California and we don't really have any BBQ there, so I like to indulge a little when I travel.   Last month I was in Ft Worth, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, and New Orleans.    People there  said I had to try the Salt Lick in Round Rock (outside of Austin), and it was \"ok\"... I thought at the time.. \"ok, it's above average\"... I thought maybe I didn't really have a taste for it.   New Orleans Jambalaya can't be matched... I'll leave it at that.  I didn't try the gumbo at Bobby Q, I just thought I would be disappointed after New Orleans a couple of weeks ago.   Brisket was unbelievable, also the best I've ever had.   I tried the 3-meat combo and had chicken, St. Louis ribs, and brisket.   All were over the top, the brisket especially.  The ribs were very large and very tender.. probably the best I've ever had (anywhere).   Mac & Cheese is supposedly their specialty... it was good, but I've had better, it wasn't that memorable but I didn't leave any behind either.  Baked potato side ... I wasn't happy with it, seemed under cooked or something.   I usually have a salad at least once a day, but I didn't try it at Bobby Q, I assumed it wasn't their thing.   Ambiance was excellent but I opted to sit in the patio, it was a beautiful night, but what a mistake.   It was only occupied by a work-party or something and they were rather ripped, drunk, and to the point of talking about what it's like to travel in the south as a gay man, etc... kind of crude and I wasn't interested, neither was anyone else... higher class places would have asked them to leave. (I dinged the score for this).  After the crowd had it's fill of drinking, they turned to smoking... Oh My ... Yuck... haven't seen that in about a decade... One nice thing about California... smoking is fine, as long as it's 200 feet from anyone else.  The patio has a cover that is low and curved at the sides, it held the smoke in like an airship.   After 20 minutes, I was really gagging and it made the food taste awful.   Smokers... I know you like to light up after dinner, but you don't smoke \"during\" dinner.  Why is that?  Makes the food taste nasty? Yes... it does... learn to be considerate and take it outside for people that are eating and paying as well.   Took any desire for dessert away, I just wanted to leave at that point.   If not for the smoking (which should really be banned in the constrained area), and the mediocre sides I would have given it 5 stars.   As it is, solid 4 (meat was that good).",

Just very good, high-quality ingredients -- and the right amount of them. Soft, flavorful bun. Fresh, hand-formed, patties. Mmmm!  Oh yeah, the BBQ here is good too. Their sauce is great; and they serve it in heated containers so it doesn't get your food cold. Try the BBQ Chicken sandwich -- with fries or coleslaw because both are top notch.  Lastly, if you check in with your phone, you'll see a 10% discount to Yelpers if you mention it.",

Ordered the BBQ pork and BBQ brisket sandwiches... couldn't taste the difference between the two.  the meat was tender but lacked flavor.   The mac n cheese was just like store bought Velveta... nothing special... nothing great.   The pickle was good...  tea wasn't bad.   The peach cobbler... the crust tasted like it had onion powder in it.. really off putting.   So... it was edible.. but.. it wasn't cracked up to what I thought the place was going to be after reading all the wonderful reviews.  Nice atmosphere... but... the BBQ wasn't anything special.  there are several smaller BBQ places around Phoenix which are much better.  Sadly... even Famous Dave's was better than this place IMO.   So... 1 1/2 -2 stars....  I had much better.   Hatch",

I have been here a few times for lunch with my dad & the engineering company I used to work for would always order it in for lunch meetings. Last night I wasn't in the mood to cook dinner so I called in a to go order & used my $50 gc I got for my bday, thx bro!  I ordered the following for the Mr. & I: q-rolls (app), smokehouse burger (no bbq sauce-add mustard) with shoestring fries, half rack of back baby ribs with mac & cheese & potato salad & for dessert their homemade mud pie. Oh & it also came with 4 pieces of cornbread & I bought a bottle of their BBQ sauce.   The q-rolls were so freakin good, the chipotle dip that comes with is delish! My hubs said his burger was just ok but loved the fries. My ribs were fall off the bone tender & the mac & cheese was yummy. I didn't have room for the potato salad, but I've had it before & it's always good. I have to say their cornbread is so amazing, possibly the best I've ever had! The mud pie was just ok, the cookie crust had a weird taste & they used vanilla & chocolate ice cream, I prefer it with mocha. My hubby however, thought it was very good.   We'll definitely be back whenever we have a craving for some delicious BBQ!",

    "text": "Before the food review, I need to praise our server, Edgar, who was efficient, adorable, and helpful.  The atmosphere is also really nice. The portions were adequate for the price.  Now.....  Good Q flavor is a fairly subjective thing.  That being said, well-cooked meat should be pretty objective.  The meats I had here, I wasn't real excited about.    There's \"falling off the bone tender,\" and then there's mush.  I found ours to be of the mushy variety.  The mouth-feel was pretty weird.  We had the baby backs, pulled pork, and brisket.  There was not much outer crust, and that's what held what flavor the meat possessed.  Under that was lightly-flavored mush.  The baby backs had potential.......  Sides we had:  pecan coleslaw (\"we ran out of pecans\") - I liked it because it wasn't of the sugary-sweet-and-gloppy southern variety, and I could actually taste the cabbage.....mac 'n' cheese - ton of very creamy sauce that was on the bland side.....beans - pretty good, and I'm not a fan of BBQ beans, usually.....roasted corn - very buttery.....corn bread - flat disks that were of the crumbly-and-not-too-sweet type, as opposed to the cake-disguised-as-cornbread kind a la Marie Callenders.  I might go back for a burger...some cornbread....some of the little doughnuts served gratis at the end of the meal.....maybe not........",

We loved it then, took our son when he turned 17 (13 years ago) and the place always had a soft spot in our hearts.  Then it changed with the times and became Bobby Q's BBQ.  The hubby and I had to try it after all our times there in high school, college and beyond.  We were very pleasantly surprised at the change and delighted with the food!  The BBQ us terrific and shows how their slow cooking technique pays off.  I love the fries and the salads are good too.  A nice stiff cocktail arrives when ordered and the service is mighty good.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are HUGE!  The crowning jewel are the hot little biscuit dough donuts like Mom used to make with cinnamon and sugar; served in a paper bag.

They bring you hot corn bread when you sit down that is to die for.  They bring butter with it but I think it is already drenched in butter.  Very rich and delicious.  Not your typically dry corn bread by a long shot.  My husband and I ordered the 3 meat combo that comes with 2 sides.  We ordered the short ribs, pulled pork and \"Broasted\" chicken with Macaroni and Cheese and cole slaw with pecans.  The ribs were are absolutely our favorite.  Best ribs we've ever had.  The pulled pork was equally good and the chicken was great too although we would have liked a piece of white meat.  As someone else stated, they bring their two sauces in warming containers so that the sauce is warm and doesn't cool your meat.  The spicy sauce was our favorite and we used the entire container.  My husband said the mac-n-cheese was the best he had ever had.  It was good, I'm just not an expert on that dish.  I liked the pecans on the cole slaw.  My son was with us and he ordered the cheeseburger off of the kids menu.  The adult menu claimed to have some sort of fantastic burger and he was not happy that we made him get the kids burger.  Until it came.  They do not skimp on the kids!  His burger was huge, hand formed, and absolutely delicious!  He kept going on about how great it was so I had to have a bite.  Grilled deliciousness.  The fresh made donuts they give you on the way out are a nice touch but I was way to full to even comtemplate trying one.  My husband and son said they were great.  Only disappointment-Shoestring Fries.  I like big steak fries.    We will be back!",

I don't even think the pork ribs are smoked...  The service bumps it up a star, otherwise, a two-star establishment.",

I had their pork baby back ribs with mash potatoes and beans.. If you like ribs you have to try these ribs they were really really good! (Ask for a side of the BBQ source)   Our server was on point with everything super friendly! I give her a 10 :)   We also got 10% off our bill for checking in using the yelp app so make sure you do that for the discount ;)",

    "text": "What a find!  Being Southern, I was skeptical at first about finding good Southern food in Arizona.  We drove up and parked in the adjacent parking lot, and were surprised that the entrance was on the other side of the building!  But the rustic looking building was attractive on the outside, and when we entered we were surprised at how classy looking the inside was.  We were seated earlier than our 7:00 p.m. reservation on Open Table at comfortable booths that had movable banquettes on each side-- booths are sometimes a problem for me due to my size, but problem solved!  We of course had to order the local specialty draft, Bobby-Q's Amber Ale from Sonora Brewing, and we both enjoyed our pints, accompanied by sweet corn bread muffins, which my wife said were made from Jiffy mix, which we both love anyway.  We then selected the onion block, accompanied by a delicious Bobby-Q sauce for dipping, and we could not eat it all and brought about a third of it home.  Lightly battered and delicious.  We then chose to split the combination platter at the recommendation of our super friendly and attentive waiter, Jason, and he was so right because we even took part of that home too.  The one we chose had both of our favorites on it,  baby back ribs for me and fried catfish filet for my wife.  The catfish was perfect and savory, and the ribs fell off of the bones--honestly, I did not use my knife to separate them, just my fork.  For our sides we chose ranch beans, simmered with pork shreds and delish, and pecan cole slaw, which I don't eat but my wife wanted to try.  She liked the slaw, but the chopped pecans were just sprinkled on top and were not as good as those we have in Georgia.  Jason brought us a box for the leftover onion loaf and a rib, along with a short small brown bag, cut off and imprinted with \"THANK YOU\" on it, containing four little cute fried sugar donuts, a nice touch.  The manager came by near the end of our meal to ask how everything was, and we praised the food and Jason's service.  A beautiful night out and we felt like we were back in the South!",

I love beef ribs so much and restaurants don't always have them. Not only do they have beef ribs they are to die for. They are the best I've had in my life! They were incredibly tender and flavorful. The st.louis ribs were also super tender and flavorful. The sausage was good but, we probably should have got more ribs because those ribs are just so awesome. The atmosphere is very nice. The staff was very attentive and nice. Oh and the best part is that it is cheap. Our bill came out to like 50 bucks which is very good because I'm used to spending at least 70 at any BBQ restaurant.",

Bobby Q's isn't as good as some of my favorites around the country, but for Phoenix, I give it an A+.  Many of the establishments in town have ok meat, but horrible sides.  Bobby Q was great all around!  From the corn bread, to the bbq sandwiches and finally the mini-donuts for dessert (that were even hot) everything was fantastic.    The venue is a bit more upscale than most bbq joints and the parking lot and restaurant itself are gigantic.  Don't worry about getting a spot on a week night, there is plenty of room!",

    "text": "Baffled at the ratings this place gets.  The ambiance is nice, and it would be a fun place to go with a group of friends for drinks and \"pre-gaming it\" before going out.  But...  My family and I are rib lovers, and in no way shape or form did Bobby Q make the grade.    The waiter touted them as smoking \"all of their meats\" for over 18 hours.  I almost fell of the booth, because you smoke meat that long either it's going to get bitter from the amount of creosote building up, or at the very least it'd be overcooked (well, perhaps except for pulled pork).  Ribs can tolerate about 5 hours.  His hyperbole was obvious.  Perhaps some people get really excited when they hear this line, because it's supposed to sound impressive.      I ordered the St. Louis style spares, and parents ordered the baby backs.  All of the ribs were overcooked and mushy (\"falling off the bone\").  The spares were actually better cooked than the babys, which isn't saying much.  Interestingly enough, the babys were very fatty, in fact my Dad was spitting out pieces of fat.  Spares were not as bad (go figure, given it's usually the other way around).  We are not \"fat shy\" but this was really excessive.  The rack was not trimmed properly.  The ribs tasted smoked, although not an overly pronounced smoke ring.  Definitely not smoked 18 hours.  People freak about the Mac & Cheese here, but it's really nothing special.  Creamy and they certainly use processed cheese (which isn't always bad), but nothing more.  I really liked the beans - not too sweet.  In short, I could see how the other offerings on the menu may be good, and given the ambience and service another experience with different food may give better ratings, but ya gotta do your ribs well if you are going to call yourself a BBQ restaurant.  Once again, the lack of good BBQ in Phoenix continues to amaze me.  As a side note, we had leftover ribs.  I came home with my parents and was about to take them in the house.  My parents said, \"you really aren't going to eat those, are you\"?  I said, \"probably not\".  Into the trash they went.",

    "text": "Let me just say that I am not a BBQ kind of girl. My husband is a BBQ fiend so I tend to make some concessions for him. Bobby Q's was one of those concessions. Thank goodness for that because I love this place. Luckily for me, there are things here I would eat such as the grilled salmon ($17) and chimichurri shrimp ($16). And the sides, good heavens, the sides are so damn good. The only ones I ever get are the sweet, buttery corn and the mac and cheese. Neither are healthy (the corn is extremely buttery) and the mac and cheese is extremely gooey...just the way it should be! I am a sucker for a good mac and cheese and then when you factor in the best corn bread I have EVER eaten, I am a goner. Good lord, you would think I am hungry the way I am writing this review but I promise I am writing this on a full stomach. No, but seriously, if you like corn bread, you have to try Bobby Q's corn bread. It's ridiculous. Then at the end of the meal, they give you these sugary donuts (the granulated sugar) that just top off a great meal. If you go on Sundays, try the Hog Heaven. For $29, you can feed 3-4 people. It has pulled pork, beef brisket, baby-backed ribs, bbq chicken, two sides, and corn bread. I do think the sides are not enough for four people compared to the amount of meat you get. We ordered it last night and had enough meat for 5 people but enough sides for only 2 people. They did give us 6 pieces of corn bread, though. Either way, it is a GREAT deal.   The interior is very nice with dim lighting for a possibly romantic feel. It seems kid-friendly and we haven't had any issues bringing our almost 3 year old here. We have also always had good service. The prices are on the higher end but as I mentioned the Hog Heaven on Sundays is a very reasonable deal when eating out. Hmmm, I think another visit this week is in order....",

And the potato salad is amazing. With the suggestion of the awesome server (Sierra) that we had, I ventured to the mac n cheese as my side. WOW! That mac n cheese is so freaking creamy and cheesy, but it is not over kill either. I still nibbled on my husbands potato salad, but I am such a fan of it that I could not resist. They also have cornbread here before the meals, now I do not like cornbread so it did take me a couple visits of my husband telling me to try it before I actually did, and now I am mad that it took me so long and look forward to it every time!!  The smokehouse burger is simply amazing! SO flavorful and juicy and deliciousness on a plate with bacon and cheese and BBQ sauce! LOTS of goodness all in one.  We have never had a bad experience here, everyone is always in such a good mood and so willing to be a team and help each other so when I say that Sierra was simply wonderful, I am also complementing the entire staff :)  Now for dessert....they bring out fresh house made (which everything here is house made) hot donuts! Save room because if you take them to go you are doing it wrong! YUM! I cannot wait to go back and eat there again.",

Charged $14.00 for a glass of St. Michel Reisling ($7 to $8. for a bottle at any super market)  Also charged $14. for a well-drink and $9. for a bottle of Bud Light!

Perhaps this was a dishonest bartender, taking advantage or perhaps prices have since been reduced.

I went for a Yelp UYE dinner and had a half rack of St Louis ribs with cole slaw and mac and cheese.  Last night I was there in a party of four and had the Smokehouse burger.  That is one of the best $10 burgers I have ever had.  The bun doesn't really hold up well so if you put it down you will end up finishing it with a fork.  Around the table there were ribs, steak and pulled pork.  It was my choice of restaurant and everybody loved their food!  One of our party ordered a Mojito and was told they don't make those there but other than that the drinks were fine.  I have now sampled 3 of their desserts, I didn't care much for the peach cobbler but the banana cream and the chocolate over dose were really good.",

Nice smoke flavor, but had a steam-table quality to the meats (like they had been sitting in a warmer for a while). No bark with the pork and no smoke ring on the brisket, which made me wonder if the meat was really smoked for 18 hours as advertised. However, the sausage had nice snap, good spice, and smoke, so at least that was legit...unfortunately, a real BBQ joint needs better brisket/pork (did not try the ribs) to get a high rating.  This place was a good value, nice service, and satisfying food. I'll try the ribs next time, but my search for real barbecue in the valley continues.",

Ribs were incredible, and their sides are amazing. Great portion sizes, and you get a lot of food for their prices. The hard part was actually finding out how to get there from off I-17; the Dunlap exit is the key to success!  We cannot wait to return.",

Ribs are all right, but the meat quality is no where near that of a 4 or 5 star joint. Steak is just bad.   This is an ideal place for take-out or a quick lunch sit in; don't bring your bbq savvy friends or girlfriend here.",

    "text": "I was super excited to try this place because I always heard good things about it, but was actually very disappointed during my visit. This place is jam packed on a Friday and Saturday night, but I will say their service is pretty responsive and fast to get the food out. I only got salad so I'm not going to get into the food part since it will be biased. However, the night got turned upside down when I initially got my check and saw they charged me 15 dollars for a 12 dollar salad! Side note, this place is way pricier than I expected a BBQ place would be. Anyways, I told the gentleman about the salad upcharge and he seemed like he didn't believe I was overcharged and he was like \" let's look through the menu together.\" Hello I'm not a little kid, you don't need to be condescending. Anyways, he saw that I was correct on the price and he changed it, blaming their system for generating that amount. I wonder how many people got overcharged for that salad without anyone saying something?? I still wonder if they even updated their system... anyways, not a huge issue until I got overcharged at the club/bar portion AGAIN ON THE SAME NIGHT!! This is when my nostrils began to blow smoke out of them... we went into the club which basically to get in you have to sign your name on a paper, get your picture taken, your photo id is scanned, and donate an arm and a leg(jk about that part), never seen that in my life, so strict for such a run down club... then we go to the pay section and find out it's 12 dollar coverage fee!! For a ghetto club, are you kidding me... I give them my card, and they act all quiet and don't tell me anything, all of a sudden they don't give my card back the guy escorts me downstairs without informing me what was going on... I was low key thinking I was going to be an interrogation room not knowing what I possibly could have done wrong. He still has my card in his hand and gives it to the bartender and then leaves still saying nothing to me. Worst security escorter ever! Then I get my card back from the bartender and I ask what is going on and he tells me that they don't take card at the front so I had to go down to the bar to pay the cover... I then look at my check and find out I was charged 30 dollars (15 each) for the cover when I'm told it was 12 each at the front!! The bartender apologizes and says he will get us a drink on the house... FYI the drink was the worst crap I've ever had in my life... at this point I wanted out and talked to security about my experience.. he says that I probably won't get a refund but I can go talk to the general manager. Literally the general manager finds out we want a refund(after only being there for 5 minutes) and he doesn't even bat an eye before saying of course, give these girls a refund. I want to thank him for being an intelligent person, but I hate to say that his staff are complete dim wits who should find a new job or receive better training on how to treat people.",

Never failed taste  - always busy even though it is in old housing neighborhood. Service is excellent - manager always comes around to ask for taste of food and service. Very well manged and you can taste good old Barbecue. Deserts are good too. Sunday special is something you want to try if you have four people.",

With the number of positive reviews I was afraid it may be packed so I made a reservation with open table.  We arrived and were immediately seated. It was busy, but for lunch doesn't look like a reservation is necessary.  Our server was amazing and I regret not getting her name. She was very attentive and I appreciated her questions. She asked if we were looking to rush in and out. It was a working lunch so we let her know we weren't in a big rush. She said she likes to ask in case we needed to be back within an hour.  We ordered our food I went with the St. Louis ribs and the Mac and Cheese as my side.  We had our food within 10 minutes.  The ribs were very tender and had a great taste. We were offered extra BBQ sauce which I enjoyed the flavor.  I was really surprised by the Mac and cheese. It was very good and my favorite part of my meal.  We stayed at our table for an hour and forty-five minutes.  We didn't want to be rude by taking up space, but they told us there was no rush and to enjoy our beverages and finish up our work.  Glad I found this place.",

I went in for lunch today (on a Sunday) and much to my surprise they had a Sunday Feast special for $28.  It was 4 meats and 2 sides.  Phenomenal.  We had so much food left over we had to bring some home.    The service was really good.  Our server was training someone as well and my experience at other restaurants is that usually slows things down.  Not today.  Our Iced Tea's were always full.  The only complaint I had was that I was trying to watch a football game on the TV and one of the servers turned the TV away from the dining room and towards the host station so they could see it.  They should be aware it's not about them - it's about their customer.  It wasn't a big deal so I wasn't going to say anything but thought I'd throw that in here in case the owner is reading.    I still give it five stars today.  We will be back soon!",

I think it was because I moved from Florida, where BBQ is delicious and cheap, and I was reluctant to \"splurge\" on pulled pork at a place like this.    The ambiance is fantastic, you feel great walking in.  The last star was left off for service, which I wasn't a huge fan of.  We were attended to just fine, but I wasn't a fan of our waiter's demeanor.  He didn't seem to know the menu well, which is a shame because it isn't huge.  I kind of felt like he was reading a script, emphasizing the whole \"smoked for 18 hours\" thing, which rubbed me the wrong way.  But aside from the waiter not being invited to my Christmas party, the place was great.  The food was really delicious, and well worth the money.  I believe that with an appetizer, any 2 people could easily share any entree.    I do have to say this - if you go, do NOT skip out on the banana dessert.  OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I am a freak for banana pudding, but this treat is on a whole new level.  It was thick and custardy, cold and delicious.  The best part was the crust, which was almost granola-esque.  I've never had anything like it, and doubt I ever will... until I go back to Bobby Q for some more!",

We decided to give it one more try a year later and had virtually the same experience. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. There are much better places to go in the Phoenix area.",

Greeted and seated promptly. Friendly but not intrusive server who was always there at the right time. Great corn bread to start. Had the BBQ chicken sandwich and shoestring fries. Delicious. Also, the five you a mini sugar donut made onsite with your bill. OMG best part of the meal. Leaves you with a great taste in your mouth. Pun perhaps intended or not ;)",

But, it's not just the food that's amazing; the service is some of the best I've had as well. One server in particular, Rishad, has always been friendly and made sure that everyone at my table was taken care of.",

    "text": "There is good and bad in my review. Ultimately I do not regret going here but I feel obliged to pass on the whole story.  So we were going to be in Phoenix for a few days for my son's birthday. Bobby Q was one of the restaurants that came up as a recommended place to eat. I was told when I looked them up on Urban Spoon that if I mention them that I would get 10% off, so I figure \"hey why not?\" I mention it to the waitress when we arrive and when we get our bill and nothing was done. Though 7 or 8 bucks really won't make or break me, if they think coming out a few bucks ahead is worth having that advertised on a site like this then I simply think that's a foolish way to conduct business - draw people in with a deal and then back out on it. That being said I did like the food there. It wasn't the cheapest meal but it also wasn't outrageous (I think about 70-80 for my wife, son, and I). We went with the one offer that was like $40 for a couple of different types of ribs, sides, and other meat products. We were honestly quite full and agreed our health would take a major hit if we were to eat like that on a regular basis. Pretty cool decor in the place. I'd rate it higher but it does bug me with their False offers. Honour it or take it down. If you go in with that knowledge you'll probably more or less enjoy your dining experience.",

    "text": "First time at Bobby Qs! Four of us went for a birthday dinner last . We had the baby backs, sirloin steak and prime rib. Also baked potatoes, coleslaw and corn (buttery roasted corn shaved off the cob). And of course the corn bread and donuts. Everything was DELICIOUS! I was skeptical about getting the prime rib because at many places it can be really fatty and you end up not getting much meat. Not here! The waiter (Josh) assured me it was a lean cut of meat, and it was! Very tender and flavorful. The steaks were perfectly cooked and the ribs were tender with not too much sauce. (The ribs were not \"mush\" like other reviewers have said.) They also treated us to a piece of yummy banana cream pie as a birthday treat (the crust was thick and nutty) - tastefully presented with no annoying restaurant staff choir. It was very nice.   All that being said, the outside of the building and the inside don't match. We used to go to Bobby McGees so I did sort of expect the old Bobby McGees atmosphere - with old bathtubs and mismatched furniture... it was a goofy, fun place back in the day. Now the interior is just nice. Not that that's bad.   Oh, and we mentioned Yelp and got a 10% discount. :)",

I have to start by saying that told the hostess that it was my husband's birthday but nothing was ever said about it. I don't expect alot but a candle stuck in the mac n cheese or in a donut as acknowledgement that it was his birthday would have been nice. That said, our server, Zac, was lovely. Very attentive and pleasant. Clearly, the hostess just didn't bother to mention the birthday because I'm sure that Zac would have said something nice. He was great. The baby back ribs were yummy. Very fall off the bone. The mac n cheese is quite cheesy and I love the cornbread. On this occasion, we didn't have dessert because we were stuffed from ribs but I have had the banana dessert before and it is spectacular.",

The waitress we had was excellent, she was knowledgeable, very attentive but not annoyingly so. I got pulled pork platter and my wife got the pulled pork sandwich. Both of these were excellent. The portions were a good size, and the corn bread was very good as well. My wife ordered the lemonade to drink, which she said was great and couldn't get enough of. My son ordered the cheeseburger and was not too impressed, although he is a picky eater sometimes. Also, when leaving, they give you a couple of mini sugar doughnuts as a treat that they make fresh at the front of the restaurant.",

    "text": "Review for first time going to Bobby Qs - lunch on a Sunday. Ordered the pulled pork with a side of mac. Food was very tastey. The mac and cheese was made in house. It's all about the cheese sauce and there's was very rich without being greasey. The pulled pork was tender and not drown in sauce. I thought the serving would be a little larger a serving. The mac did not fill the bowl and the bun (not a roll) the pulled pork was served on was about the size of a McDonalds cheeseburger roll. It was piled pretty high, but it was 20% smaller than I pictured for the price. I ordered two brews service ice cold in a frosted glass. Service was quick and very good. I would go back again to try the platter. Just be really hungry or bring a bunch of friends because the people next to me ordered it, and it's a huge plate.",
