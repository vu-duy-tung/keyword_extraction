The atmosphere is clean and modern , has nice booth seating and was comfortable. It has a lot of ambiance potential :)  I came in around 4p so maybe down time for them??  However it is downtown near a lot of hotels and such so I'm sure they are used to it. I mean HH!?!?  Ok so this is probably something that bothers me more than most BUT I am all about atmosphere and ambiance....A nice Italian restraunt and COUNTRY music on the radio, LOL! Like super countryfied Country!!  Really killed the vibe and made me question how serious they are about their establishment..... I know, I know, sounds EXTREMLY nit- picking of me AND I am from Texas! I love country music but I made me feel like I was invading their down time and that managers jam or whatever ! ALSO the menu is exclusively  Italian so??!??    Ok so past the music thingy. The  waiter brought bread and some sort of pesto sauce for dipping. It was very vinegary, I didn't care for it, olive oil is preferable to me,  but bread was good.   Under my waiters suggestion I tried the Chicken Piccata. It was pretty flavorable and nice size portion...very \"rich\" I would say, but chicken looked kinda slimy under piccata sauce. I ate half then lost my appetite.  My server was nice, probably the manager because he had regular clothes on.  Overall I would probably give it another try, maybe at night time when they are hopefully more prepared for guests and try something else on the menue.",

I ordered their lobster mac and cheese and was surprised we did not get bread with our order. The entree itself was nothing special a bit dry and desperately in need of flavor. My husband had the burger. Though he ordered it medium well, it was very dry. Even the sweet potato fries needed more seasoning!  Decorations: They had some pretty interesting light fixtures.

The pasta was perfectly tender on my bolognese, and while I am not sure why they call the breadsticks \"drunken\" they were buttery and soft. Price was perhaps more than the food was worth, but the staff were attentive and professional. I was seated at the bar instantly on entering, no wait.   One improvement could be made with the ladies running around. The cross between entirely professional and almost wearing lingerie felt off putting. But don't let that stop you from enjoying a game at the bar or a night with your friends. Absolutely would come back by myself or with friends/family.  Decor is modern and attractive, white tabletops look amazing and show if they are not clean: I love that kind of accountability!",

We arrived at 8:42 pm in which the hostess told us they were closing in 15 minutes. I was ok with that and told her to seat us still in which they don't close till 9. The hostess then proceed to tell us they were on a limited menu until they close. I asked her why in which we are paying customers. My girlfriend and I decided we didn't feel welcomed at The Strand so we left.  This is when the manager or hostess went crazy. When we were outside talking about how rude she was, she came out and started being very defensive. We explained to her if the sign says 9 then stay open till 9 serving guests. She kept making excuses that the staff wanted to go home. I told her to close at 8:30 then. She then said \"Come on in then, you get what you wanted.\" She was screaming this in a very defensive manner in which we felt threatened.  My girlfriend and I both work in the customer service industry. I have stayed open later just to make that customer happy. That's part of the job. For the lady that treated us with so much disrespect, she shouldn't work anywhere around people with those customer service skills.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that the only reason I'm giving this place a 2 star is because the manager ended up comping our meal at the end.  So, let's start with \"the good\". The look of the restaurant is spectacular. It looks Italian, and decor is intriguing (esp. the lights over each table). If Yelp was based on looks alone, the Strand would be a solid 5. Too bad for the Strand that this is not the case...  Now for \"the bad\". The bad outweighs the good like a boulder outweighs a crumb, so let me put this in list form.  1.) The service: We entered this establishment with no prior knowledge of it, no bias. After taking a seat, the four of us ordered our meals shortly after. Another family entered the Strand approximately 10 minutes after us and were seated at the empty table next to us. Their food was served to them 10 minutes before ours made it out to us. One of the folks in our party very specifically ordered their dish without mushrooms. It was brought out with mushrooms. Some time passed before we spotted our server (or A server for that matter) and catching her to let her know of the mistake wasn't an easy feat. Finally, the dish was corrected, though it was brought out after everyone else had:  finished their plates. And although the rest of our dinners were less than desirable, we ate most it because we were all hungry and there were no servers around to bring this up to.  2.) The food: The mushroom thing; okay, that's an honest mistake (though the time it took to correct it was not), but even when they brought out the plate for the 2nd time, the rice was undercooked and crunchy, and it lacked any flavor at all. Everyone at the table tried a bite to confirm this. The pasta another person at our table ordered was overcooked and soggy, while the pizza my wife and I ordered was burned to a crisp. Of course, we would have complained earlier on in our visit if the servers were actually around and didn't dart out of sight as soon as you spotted them.   3.) The overall experience: Chef Ramsay would have a heyday with this place. Aside from the food that makes one wonder if the chef themselves have ever actually tasted it, and the absent servers, the manager himself didn't seem to understand what constructive criticism is. When he finally came out after requesting him twice, he didn't seem to like what we had to say and tried negating our complaints with the fact that three of the four of us had eaten most of what we'd ordered (after we'd explained the server situation). He asked for constructive criticism, to which we explained that every complaint we had actually was constructive as he could use it to improve upon his business (duh.) He threw his arms up frustrated and said, \"Fine, you're meals comped\" before storming off. I felt bad for a few seconds and then I suddenly didn't anymore. The food sucked, the service was terrible, and because of the terrible service we reluctantly nibbled on the sucky food. I'd have felt violated if we would had to pay for that craptastic experience.   This place deserves a 1 star review, but because of the manager's decision to do the right thing at the end, I decided to be kinder to their overall rating. I hope that the manager used our constructive criticism to make dining at the Strand more pleasant for future customers.",

I ate maybe a 3rd of it, before I couldn't stand it anymore. My sister had the basic spaghetti and meatballs. She said it was ok, but nothing to write home about. Since we had more time to kill after dinner, we ordered a bread pudding for dessert. The smell was incredible. But, the bread itself was SUPER dense, so much so that I could barely use my spoon to cut through it. But the flavor was decent, but again, nothing to write home about.",

Not always a fan of Italian, but I was excited to see what the Strand had to offer. We were exhausted from the Spring training games and the weather was perfect outside for mid March. So, we sat outside..........the restaurant was bustling busy, but we were seated right away and offered drink specials, menu etc. Sitting outside always has its plus side beside the breeze on a perfect night, but the walking traffic was entertaining to say the least. If you are offended by the homeless, I suggest do not sit out side - but we felt comfortable and enjoyed our views of the city lights and busy Rickshaw's none the less. The service was delightful, we received the complimentary bread and olive oil/balsamic for dipping and ordered a great bottle of wine. Our food came quickly and the drunken shrimp special was AMAZING! My partner in crime ordered the Chicken Parmesan and easily filled his tummy with room to spare for Tiramisu which was so silky smooth and delicious. There were couples and families with children - so I would say family atmosphere.Large portions for the price and we were truly happy with our dining choice for the evening. Until next March Strand, see you soon.",

Our server was very attentive and friendly even with the place being packed. I ordered a martini and a margherita pizza. My drink was good but I was very disappointed in the pizza. The crust and dough were very limp and cheese too thick. When I took a bite, almost all of the cheese on the slice tried to come with it because it was so thick. I had some of my husband's pizza which was only slightly better. The dough was just too limp and not what I would expect from this place. Maybe Little Caesers.

But I ordered from the Kid's menu, wanting spaghetti for my little guy, and the menu listed penne. I knew that was a no go. So she said she could sub in another pasta. Was is spaghetti? No, but very close. Are the noodles thicker? Yes, but it's just like spaghetti, promise.  I said I was unsure, she assured me it was similar enough. My son isn't old enough to have figured out the conversation himself, but he was sure that wasn't spaghetti when it hit the table. Wouldn't touch it.

I have never heard of a restaurant dealing with customers like this. I was excited to have an Italian fast casual restaurant in my neighborhood but I do not think I will be eating here again. Food is ok, but I would suggest not eating here when it is a busy night. Clearly the management is not up for the job.",

    "text": "DO NOT GO HERE.  One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.  The setup is a little like \"Pei Wei\" where they take your order, give you a number, and bring the food to your table.  Placed our order, and had to stalk other tables and hover over people eating trying to wait to get a table.  Waited a long time, all the while others who ordered after us found seats and got their food before us. Servers kept bringing my food to me since it was ready, but I still didn't have a table, so they kept saying they would \"put it under the heat lamp\" for me.  Finally eventually found a table, and then kept waiting and waiting for our food, which the manager claimed \"he had them remake\" since it was getting cold.  My food came, and it was cold and disgusting.  We had to get going since we were going to a show, and my mom's food still wasn't there.  The staff asked to see her receipt, since they couldn't find her order.  She went up to the manager and said she just wanted her money back since we had to go (it had been 45 minutes since we placed our order).  He said her food would not be ready for a while, and gave her some cash, and we left.  My mom never even ate, and my food was horrible.  I would NOT recommend this place, it's awful.",

The atmosphere is really nice and it looks fancy and expensive but it's actually reasonably priced. We sat down right away and waited 10 min just to put our drink orders in. We got our drinks within 5 minutes and ordered Calamari and a side salad...that's it! The calamari came out so fast literally within 7 minutes and it was absolutely disgusting. There was no flavor at all! We're waiting 25 minutes and my salad still hasn't arrived! Literally a side salad, oh and let's not forget my waiter was no where to be found. I saw the hostess walking around and I told them to cancel the salad and take the calamari off cuz it's disgusting and we're not eating it or paying for it.  Our \"waiter\" was also the bartender and never came back to check on us. I'm also pretty sure that bread is complimentary and we NEVER got any.  I also noticed that people around were looking for a server to place their order and based on reviews here the service ALWAYS sucks.  I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND.",

The Bolognese is good... Maybe two small portions if you want to split it for two lunches. I asked if they could include bread, she said they would but when I opened my order up when I got to my desk, there was no bread. Should have confirmed when I picked it up but would have been nice if they did so without a reminder. It's the small things that matter to me... The taste of the Bolognese is okay, not anything super amazing but it was just shy of $11 for the entree. Also will ask for more sauce next time. So I'll try the take out again but will have to triple check my order at pick up.",

It was not too overpowering of either topping and the dough was thin crust, but still soft and slightly doughy. The veggie pizza was also yummy, but the fig & prosciutto still wins in my book!   The restaurant itself has a cozy ambiance that is perfect for a date night or girls night out. Our waitress was extremely friendly, and we had a great time at dinner. Parking was a little hard to find, but I would come back for a nicer night out for good quality pizza!",

Aptly named, I was very angry to see that I received only 5 small shrimp (with some baguette on the side).  I called the restaurant to confirm that I received the correct amount of shrimp, and that my delivery person didn't have herself a little snack on ride here (Door Dash is a fantastic food delivery service btw).  They said they give 5 shrimp at lunch and 6 shrimp at dinner.  I was then reminded that this was an appetizer I ordered (That cost me $11.90, plus $4 delivery charge, plus other fees).  To which I responded \"would you be able to share 5 small shrimp?\".  He assured me that there is nothing he could do but I could go back to my delivery service and ask for a refund of my delivery fee.  What I want is more shrimp!!!!!!! I was hoping for a refund of my money, or at least half since I only received about half of what I expected.  I was not offered this or anything to make up for the bad experience.  I love the food here and these shrimp tasted amazingly!  But that love has faded with this disappointing experience.",

The Strand not only has a clever name, but is situated in a great location for folks who work/live downtown, or enjoying a concert/baseball game, etc.  The decor is unique and well-planned, as it's not too bright to create a sort of \"cool mystery\" vibe. The hanging light fixtures are VERY unique and add dramatic flair!   We didn't dine, but did pick up our lunches at the bar to go. I ordered the grilled salmon with grilled veggies, and my peers had chicken w/pasta.  I anxiously got back to work and was bummed that my salmon was WAY overcooked. I tried to continue eating, but it was near impossible for the dry flaky mass to pass my throat successfully. I picked around the fillet and ate my veggies which were awesome!  I probed my peers for their experience. They both loved their pasta and were left feeling fat-n-sassy!  Despite the dry salmon, I will give them another shot.",

    "text": "My office ended up choosing The Strand to have our post holiday luncheon here. I've been here before and never had an issue until now. There were 11 of us who were able to make the reservation we made in advance. When I made the reservation with specifics the host said they can accommodate our needs. We had two tables. At the table I was sitting at we had no issues. I told the waitress that we had previously asked if separate checks were fine and that we were doing that. She said ok no problem. I've had the lobster mac and cheese there which is delicious. I wanted to try something new this time. I opted for the pomodoro. When my food arrived it look delicious because it was plated so well. First bite no so good...it was very much flavorless! I had to add lots of salt. I had a few of the other women try it and they said it was very bland! We noticed our other table seem to be having problems but couldn't tell what was going on. After our lunch I asked one of the ladies how her lunch was. She said her meat came out burnt on the salad and the other women's lunch were not good either. Their chicken was cold and the noodles were over cooked. She then began to tell me that the waitress stared to bring out their bill without asking if they wanted anything else. They told the waitress they wanted to order dessert. That didn't sit well with the waitress as she began to cop an attitude with them. After that she brought the bills again and this time the bills were wrong. When they brought it to her attention she told them \"separate checks are a privilege\". She was really rude to them. When we were leaving I asked the waitress why she would say the comment about separate checks. She blew up at me as if it were my fault. I told her that the restaurant had no issues with doing separate checks as I had previously cleared that. She stared yelling at me then rudely threw her hands in my face and snubbed me! I asked for my bill back to remove her tip for what she had just done to me as I didn't appreciate it! She threw the bills down in front of me and told me to find it! I did and I removed my tip! She continued to yell and throw her hands in my face! While all of this was going on there was a man standing next to us working behind the bar. He was witnessing the entire incident go down. All he said was \"that's enough\". I'm not sure who he was saying that to. I walked out pissed! My coworker called the restaurant to speak with the manager. He got on the phone and introduced himself by the name Adam. Come to find out that was the man/ manager who was witnessing the incident and not stopping his employee from acting the way she did! Great managing skills Adam! To top it off he also said the \"waitress\" we we had who was rude and the one yelling at me was also a manager! I would put her name on here but she refused to give me her name. Adam continued to tell my coworker that she walked out and quit! Good! Someone like that who treats customers the way she did doesn't need to represent a restaurant in my opinion! Overall I give this restaurant a bad rating due to the horrible customer service and bland tasting food! Would never go back! Would never recommend to anyone! Much better places downtown to eat at!",

The drunken cheesy bread was meh, but our entrees were very good. I had the chicken something or another that the server recommended and it was the best dish of the bunch. I would recommend strand to anyone. The drinks were very tasty and strong without tasting strong. The atmosphere is nice as well.",

I've been waiting twenty minutes and am sitting with bread and water.  Just received my side, dinner salad. Very large for the $3 price. Also very bland. I asked for more salad dressing and almost finished m my salad before it came. I hope the entree exceeds the experience so far.  Redemption... sort of. A very large chicken parmigiana. Adequate flavor. Certainly does not lure me to take another bite.  They should put a little more attention to flavor and service and not impress people just with portion size.",

    "text": "Very cute concept...but unfortunately that is the only good thing I can say.  4 of us went for dinner prior to a Suns game and they could not handle the crowd.  This is a fast casual Italian concept - order at the counter, find a table and they bring the food to you - should be in and out.  We waited 20 or so minutes in line and then grabbed a table.  Another 30 minutes passed before the first entree was delivered.  Another 20 minutes later two more entrees arrived and 5 minutes later we received the final entree.  Unfortunately the food was mediocre at best.  We had a 12\" pepperoni pizza, two orders of ravioli with creamy tomato sauce (the ravioli on one order had hard edges) and the chicken saltimbocca.   It was edible, it was fine, but it's not worth further description.    There were many, very unhappy customers and very little effort by management to assuage anyone.  While on the subject of management, you would think that in crisis mode you would see all hands on deck in hustle mode, however that was not at all the case.  There was a manager and another employee just standing at the counter and looking around toward the end of the rush while a few customers were waiting for food and tables.  The table next to us vacated and it was 20 minutes before it was bussed.  Bizarre.  We overheard a manager (I think)  talking to some other customers and explaining that this is the third time they've experienced this kind of service break down at dinner due to the crowd.  Really?  You are a hop and a skip from US Airways Arena.  I'm pretty sure your business model was banking on that when the location was chosen.  However after two previous dinner service failures it didn't occur to you to check the downtown calendar, staff up and fix any other issues on the line?  I really wanted to like this place.  Big time fail.",

As residents, we believed they would honor this agreement but after numerous visits where its managers rejected the discount existed or worse, claimed the discount was discontinued, we've concluded both its management and its ownership has deliberately lied to us.

But, two months ago they did decide to provide full dinner service which I really appreciated! Great location and loved the decor.   We ordered the chicken parmesan pizza and the lobster mac and cheese. Pizza was underwhelming, and chicken was a bit dry. But the lobster mac and cheese was really good! Definitely rich and greasy though, so not the best for calorie conscious days.   Overall, it's alright. I think I would rather come back for the happy hour menu than do the full dinner service.",

We had two waitress's who seemed to both disappear when it came time to eat... We asked for bread with our dinner and it came after we had finished. She mentioned it needed to be cut was why it took so long. No apologies. Also when we didn't have silverware it was because it needed to be rolled. It was odd service to say the least. The waitress kept putting her hair up and down playing with it, I found that in poor taste. I would have enjoyed it more if the service was better.",

We walked in and were seated right away. Awesome! That's when it changed. We waited 25 minutes before we were even greeted. Another 20 minutes before our order was taken. Two parties of two were seated after us and were served and out the door before we even for our food.  My boyfriend was very angry and ready to leave as the poor man had not eaten all day. Finally brought the bread and pesto sauce right before the meals! Worse service I have ever experienced. Didn't come and check on us for drinks, just poorly organized. Do not come here on busy days, you will not be impressed. We will see how the food is tonight. Usually delicious! I really hate when you bring someone who has not been there before and talk it up and it turns out to be crap. The food was good, but not great due to poor service. On previous visit which was a Saturday they served happy hour margaritas. I was told no tonight. It was very disappointing.",

It was a major rip-off at the inflated price I paid.   The dish was bland, with overcooked generic boxed pasta.   I had to use a bunch of salt and nearly the whole shaker of Parmesan cheese to give it some taste.    The only saving grace was the fast service and friendly waitress.    The restaurant was empty, so this was not a case of immediate supply and demand.  This was price-gouging plain and simple.",

They are served with Boba large straws and have some fun floaty treats, yay! :) Yes, there's still a kid inside of me that loves to discover new flavors through a straw (or wait is that the old person inside of me?Ew.)   The LUNCH was amazing! You have your sandwiches; meatball and chicken parm, and served w/ choice of fries or salad. We had the best of both worlds and it was almost too much for two to share, but still, very good flavors and fresh ingredients.   We really enjoyed our time. A Stella that was served in the appropriate glass finished off our Satuday Funday, as the frozen drinks for $6 were very good. Not to sound cheap, because their wine menu was great, and they have a full bar, seemingly a perfect place for drinks with friends or more fancy times-- but this was lunch.   I will be back, maybe just for the really great decor and frozen drinks, but the food shouldn't be missed either. Nice spot to know about in Phoenix.",

    "text": "3/5 decent, will probably improve.  just had dinner here after work, it was pretty deserted, but i guess that's standard for downtown phoenix. after awkwardly asking if they were open, i realized that it was an order, seat yourself semi-fastfood joint. which is an interesting option to their established \"arrogant\" neighbor.   overall, i think it's pretty hip, maybe chic, if folks say that out here. the noodle lamp things are an interesting brand, as long as you don't accidentally associate it with strands of e.coli from AP bio, or wormsies. i think if they cut half of those lights out, then it wouldn't be so overwhelming, since the brand/style is quite easy to pick up, don't need to feel like all the tables are so perfectly podlike and replicated. i want to feel special, you know?  the prices are pretty affordable. i mean, yeah, generally food is cheaper out here, but the servings are good to share, as the tables are already set with red plates, white (durable and clothlike quality, i might add) napkins, and silverware!  the food. well it's italian pasta. ultimately (if not evidently) filling, but i resisted the temptation and took it to go (and plan to finish here in my room shortly). tried the pancetta and peas, though the pancetta wasn't browned very much, so it had that salty rawness to it that some folks aren't into. the side caesar came after it, though i'm sure in a couple weeks all the orders will arrive in the traditional order.  finally, gave them a quick tip that they shouldn't keep their plates over the range. if you're a cook familiar with oil-rich cuisines (frying, pasta, etc.), you'll be familiar with how after an amount of time there's just hella oil particles in the air, that settle over the area. it leaves a residue (read: grease), which unfortunately was also all over my nice white plate. was barely noticeable with the dim evening light, but probably visible during the day.  i'll have to see how it does the next time i am in town!",

Sliced bread with pesto sauce comes complimentary, and it was really tasty. I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was good but not great, about what I expected. The sauce it came in was pretty spicy. My friends both raved about their meals - a margherita pizza and a pasta special. This place gets bonus points for its location (right across the street from U.S. Airways Center) and for having San Tan Devil's Ale, one of my favorites, on tap.",

She was very friendly and even when one of my friends spilled his water glass she cleaned it up with a smile and didn't make a big deal about it.  The happy hour is great, I'm not 100% sure of what times it goes from but lucky for us it was on when we got there.  During happy hour you get $4 frozen concoctions, $5 specialty martinis, $2 Blue Moons, and half price appetizers.  I feel like there may be even more but that's just what I remember off the top of my head.  I ordered the bruschetta and the Strand Burger.  The bruschetta was great, the bread was perfectly crispy and it was loaded with fresh tomatoes, basil and mozzarella and I think there was some kind of red wine sauce that was drizzled over it too, really tasty!  The burger however wasn't quite my cup of tea.  I can't really even explain why, almost like the flavors just didn't blend well together, but I didn't even finish half of it and a couple of my friends who tried it also felt the same way.  The Parmesan fries that came with it on the other hand were delicious!  I'll definitely come back because of the great service and the prospect of good food, I just won't be ordering the burger again.",

The kitchen closed around 10 or 10:30 and the happy hour pricing started at 9 so there's a decent overlap. We had been here once before and decided to try it again.  The Happy hour pricing is fantastic, $2 Blue moons, I think $3-4 for other on tap beers, and $4 for very STRONG frozen margaritas. I was DD this evening so I did not partake, but the others in our group enjoyed a lot.  I ordered the Chicken Parmesan Pizza and they accidentally brought me the regular Chicken Parmesan entree. They were very apologetic and let me keep the regular Chicken Parmesan while they made the pizza. I had a few bites of what was a very large portion of chicken with penne pasta. It tasted great and the pasta was a perfect al dente. They boxed this up for us when the pizza came (I was in a pizza mood). The pizza was just a cheese pizza with sliced pieces of chicken breast, but still tasty.  Overall the food was tasty and the happy hour prices were excellent. They rectified their mistake and let us keep the food.",

After another 10 minutes or so, I returned to the Hostess stand to ask shy she never returned to update us and if I could speak with the manager on duty. The manager never nor a server ever came to the table. Meanwhile, EVERYONE that had come in with us and after us had been assigned a server and were ordering and receiving food. Just as we were preparing to leave, a make server approached the table and said he was there to take care of us, I asked if he was the manager. He said, no, but he was there to get us started. I again asked to see the manager, his response was that she was busy with customers.  I guess we did not meet this criteria.  Needless to say we left and will never return or recommend the Strand to anyone.",

    "text": "I am being generous with the 'one star' review after our encounter tonight at The Strand. Two days ago, I had called in and talked with the hostess. I made a reservation, giving my first and last name, phone number, time of reservation (9:00pm) told them it was a special occasion for a birthday on New Years, and a count of how many people were in our party. The hostess confirmed everything and it was set. (By the way, I specially asked if they were taking reservations for New Years and the host said yes we are). Yesterday, I called in to add two guests to the reservation. Confirmed. Two phone calls to the restaurant as of now. So after the Suns Game on New Years our party walked over to The Strand. We arrived about 8:55. The hostess, who we could already tell was over it by her attitude greeted us and told us they are closed. Of course, we looked at her dumbfounded. I said we have reservations that were made two days ago. The response we got, 'Yeah, you are right here on our reservation list but we close at nine'. Ok? So, first off. I am assuming this hostess that took the reservation, clearly, was not trained correctly in telling time or taking reservations. Once she told us she was not seating us, we asked to speak to a manager. She walked away and was never seen again; as we did her job for her for every other party that walked in that she didn't bother to talk to or relay the message to that they were currently closed. About five minutes after we had asked a manager walks over and we tell her the situation. She looks on the reservation and what do you know, there is our reservation. She said, well we were going to call you but didn't have a contact number. I said the hostess just told me that all of our information was right there on the reservation slip. So, where's the truth in this? The manager on duty says ok, give me a few minutes to clear a table and we'll take you for dinner. TWENTY minutes go by as we literally sit in the front of the restaurant and just watch the entire staff walk back and forth without saying a word to any of us. The 'manager', no where to be found. Finally, a 'server' comes up and says are you guys still waiting on a table? We answered, Yes and explained that the manager said that she would seat us and take us since there was a misunderstanding on their end. His response back, 'yeah that's not going to happen we are 'literally' completely out of food'. Ok? SO WE SAT AROUND AND WAITED TWENTY MINUTES, FOR WHAT? For you to act so rudely and not even be courteous enough to come talk to guests? For the manager to walk away and completely ignore us? And let me just mind you, I manage at a restaurant. I know how these types of situations go. Any DECENT restaurant could and would accommodate to an ERROR that they had made. I have had many evenings where I opened my kitchen back up to please and accommodate to my guests, as it is the professional way of doing so. To tell your party, you are completely out of food? Please, hold your breath. Be truthful and just tell us that you simply don't want to open your kitchen or make right on your mistake. NO restaurant is completely 'out of food'. I am sorry, that's the poorest excuse I've heard yet! And if you were really completely out of food, you better hire in someone who actually knows how to handle your ordering and how to inventory correctly for holidays, weekends, etc. Long story short, he just continued to sit with us and argue the fact of being out of food and not answer why no one has the courtesy to come up and talk to us the last twenty minutes we sat in the restaurant waiting. We have visited here a few times and for the record, we will be finding a new restaurant to take our business to when we visit downtown. We were treated absolutely horrible and the customer service lacked on every aspect. We took our business to Arrogant Butcher, where we were treated properly and had a good rest of our evening. Big let down on this restaurants part. The owner may want to try and get his management and staff team on the same page, and maybe try to get management FOH that knows how to handle customer service situations and address issues, not run to the bar and stand behind it to avoid contact with us. You ruined a great spot we enjoyed as I am sure you will ruin for many others with the show you are running. Happy 2018 Strand! You came in with a bang!",

    "text": "I have visited The Strand about 2 years ago when I lived in Phoenix. I liked it then, the food was good. Now visiting for vacation, I decided to bring my group along. I was disappointed walking through the door. The restaurant has not changed a bit. The decor is great. It's modern and confortable. I have no problem with that and I throughly enjoy it. The menu is exactly the same though, and I wanted to see something new and fresh. Deciding between rosemary salmon and pasta, I choose the pasta because in Seattle, we can get fresh salmon everywhere. I would love to see a fresh sheet, or just something different. We ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer and it was delish. Also fast. My pasta and my partners lobster mac came out quickly as well, which makes me worry about buyout ingredients. The food is good. However, the table next to us ordered butternut squash ravioli and we're saying it was cold.   Drink wise, the wine list is okay. Nothing to rave about. I didn't see a rose and I was kind of craving that. Settled for a reisling. My partner ordered a sangria. Waters seemed very tap tasting and unfiltered.  My biggest complaint would be with the staff. Not necessarily the quality of service, but the complete lack of class. The female servers are all in extremely short and tight skirts and lots of cleavage. Not our cup of tea. For a moment I thought the Tilted Kilt upstairs would have more class. The guys on the kitchen, although they look like they know what they're doing, I would rather see chef coats on instead of tshirts and ballcaps. Our server Jessica was nice. I would personally pay a bit more if the staff cleaned up a bit and the ingredients seemed not as bought (aka my pasta, croutons).  Overall, I liked my food but the other detractors really killed my mood. Perhaps this is what the local clientele are into, but it's not for me. This place has a ton of potential. Edit: no yelp check-in bonus: sad face.",

The Strand is a welcome addition to the downtown lunch and dinner spots. Their staff, menu, service, pricing, and ambiance is great. Ordered a garlic pizza (best combination of flavors and toppings I have EVER had on a pizza) with pesto on the side to dip. I am a pesto-connoisseur, and theirs is tops!  Not a long wait for my pizza (less than 10 minutes), but you can call your order in ahead, too.  I can't wait for lunch tomorrow to try something else! And for happy hour after work to try the delish-sounding frozen peach Bellini!  YAY STRAND!!",

    "text": "Living downtown I always like to check out new places. Being down the street from ASU downtown campus, it was quite convenient for me to stop in and check it out. Looked a little quiet on the patio, but there were a few people inside. Within a minute of setting foot in the restaurant I was greeted by a lovely employee who broke down the menu for me, especially since a majority of it is in Italian. This is a big plus in my book, considering employees give a great impression and feel for places, a greeter makes or breaks my interest in any new food place I try.   After figuring what I was going to get, the chicken Marsala with a side of spicy tomato pasta, I ordered at one of the cashiering terminals. I was told this concept of \"fast casual\" can be compared to a peiwei or chipotle. The layout it not that specific or guiding, but I didn't mind--the service was prompt.   The decor is very intriguing and I enjoy how the space is utilized. They also have a coffee bar, with hopes of breakfast in the near future, but it is a little hard to see. My food came out fairly quickly and it was hot and ready! The Marsala sauce was a bit runny, but the taste was exquisite! My chicken was slightly breaded and it was cooked great. My pasta was spicy! Those cooks do not mess around, what you ask for you get!   I had to get up and order dessert, at least that was suggested because their dessert comes out within minutes. That was a bit of an inconvenience. Anyway, the pizza cookie or pizcotti that I had was the sugar cookie and it was really good. I like my dessert, so the serving size of this dessert was nothing compared to maybe an oregano's pizza cookie. I think if I had to share it I would be a bit upset.  I had a chance to talk a bit to a few employees, due to the down time in the restaurant. Sounds like this little place has plans for a big future. Including breakfast, \"fast casual\" lunch to move through the cityscape businesses, and a full service dinner that is going to be a bit more upscale. I am excited to see the evolution of this place into something even better! Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Popped in for a quick meal before a show. Fun decor, brand new and sparkling clean, with a nice sized menu. We chose this restaurant because it advertised gluten free pasta. Unfortunately, no one on staff seemed to know what \"gluten free\" meant. When we asked which sauces might be GF to go with the GF pasta, we were met with blank stares. It took several questions to determine that the marinara sauce \"might\" be GF -not very confidence inspiring. When we did get our meals, everything tasted fine, not fabulous, about on par with a Pei Wei type experience. I had a small side house salad, which was not on the menu, but was offered by the girl at the register.  The greens were nice, but not chilled, which was kind of yucky.  The balsamic vineagrette was not able to be GF certified, so I had it on the side.  It was just OK.  My GF pasta was cooked properly, and the portion was large but not too large.  I had the primavera with marinara sauce, and while the veggies seemed fresh, they were a tad overcooked.  My husband had a pizza, seemed to be pretty good.  My daughter had a kids meal of chicken tenders and fries--the tenders were a chicken breast cut into slices, which worked, and the fries were a tad bit reminiscent of Burger King's, with some parmesan thrown on top.  The kid's meal also came with mini donuts, which we had to ask for 3 times, but there were fresh out of the fryer and covered in cinammon sugar--yummy.  We ordered ice cream with a GF chocolate chip cookie--and what arrived was definitely not a \"cookie\"--more like a gluey, gooey chocolate chip amoeba at the bottom of a dish with 2 scoops of ice cream on top.  Eh.  I tried to order an espresso machiato at the coffee bar in back of the restauant--the coffee girl didn't know the correct way to make the drink, so I opted for a soy cappucino--this was tasty and well done.  This is clearly a new business still working out the kinks. I think it's a good option if you're in downtown PHX and need a quick, decent meal.",

    "text": "I think I went to a different restaurant than the other reviewers. Maybe we should have gone with the Pasta but I was very unimpressed. We started out with the Green Tea and Marinated Olives. The tea was very good and they had Stevia which is a bonus. The crustini bread that came with the olives was very tasty. We decided to split a Pepperoni and Olive Pizza and a Caramelized Pear Salad for our mains. The Salad would easily have served two as a main or four as a side. The Pears were quite tasty but the ratio of lettuce to toppings was very off. We managed to get a few slices of pear, fig and a few walnuts that had worked their way to the the bottom. The dressing was not quite right but if there were more toppings it would be decent. The pizza on the other hand tasted like the Chef Boyardee Pizza Kits. Honestly that is what it tasted like. The olives were canned black olive slices despite the menu stating kalamata olives. The service was very odd. We had two different servers that apparently did not talk to each other. They did manage to keep our drinks refilled but they brought out the olives then a couple minutes later brought everything else out. We had to move things to another table to make it all fit. She did apologize but it seemed they could have timed it better considering the restaurant was mostly empty. I really wanted to like this place. I think they could make things work with a decent manager and a Chef other than \"Boyardee\" in the kitchen. Hopefully the owner will try some of the great pizzas we have in Phoenix such as Federal Pizza, Cibo, La Grande Orange... and see that there are better pizzas out there that don't come in a box. I debated about giving them a 2 but it was closer to a 3 overall and since Yelp doesn't do half points they get 3 but I recommend skipping the pizza and hoping the pasta and big plates are better. Maybe they will get things right eventually.",

    "text": "Very hip place right across from the diamondback stadium in downtown Phoenix. The place was packed on a Saturday night with a 45 min wait so i recommend you make reservations. My group of 6 was perfectly happy to sit at the bar. The bartender greeted us right away and asked if we wanted to sample anything after helping us narrow our selections of wine. Immediately after getting our drinks a very friendly server got our orders. We ordered appetizers but unfortunately everything came out at the same time (you may want to specify that apps come out first!). I ordered prosciutto, risotto and ricotta fried puffs that were delicious with the 2 dipping sauces as an appetizer which i shared with my friend. I also shared the veggie pizza, which was nothing to write home about. The toppings all slid off the pizza and the crust was bland. All in all i would give the atmosphere and the bartenders 4 stars but the service and the food maybe a 2. So ho to The Strand and order some drinks and an appetizer then head over to another restaurant nearby for the main course.",

Creamy Alfredo w/chicken: my brother ordered it, I tried it. Very creamy. He finished it all. Salmon and Grilled Vegetable: I ordered this, the salmon was so flavorful and juicy. Really enjoyable meal. I don't usually like salads, but this hit the spot after all the holiday carbs. Pomodoro: the GF got this. I didn't try it, but she said it was good.  Drinks:  Cabernet Sauvigon - I love wine, I ordered it to expand my brother's palette... we switched drinks and he really liked the cucumber martini. 2 Cucumber Crush Martinis: I tried it, soo yummy. It was strong, but still had flavor. Hit all around!  Ambiance: loved the decorated walls and interesting lighting fixtures. We were the only ones there for a while until a family came in. It's a hidden gem.  $100 for three people!!? Yes, definitely worth a try, I will have to take others there when I go back in town.",

I know that some servers dislike a party of one for dinner, but Analicia is not one of them. She and another woman enthusiastically greeted me at the host stand, even though it was a slow Monday night (no baseball game in town tonight.)   Analicia was attentive and friendly, quickly bringing me my drink and then my entree. She saw that I was reading so she checked in with me periodically but was never intrusive. When I asked for a box to take the rest of my lobster mac and cheese - which was delicious - back to my hotel, she took the plate and packaged it up for me. She even gave me an iced tea to go.  Terrific food and fabulous employees will bring me back to your restaurant whenever I'm in town. Please thank Analicia and the rest of your staff for making me feel welcome tonight.",

The best part of the visit was the fact that our waiter was nice enough to stamp on my receipt to validate my parking because I lost my ticket from the parking garage below the restaurant (CityScape). He was very accommodating and unfortunately that's about how good the experience was here.   The spaghetti with meatballs and balsamic vinegarette salad were horrible. The spaghetti tasted border-line elementary school cafeteria-ish, cheap and bland. Honestly, I felt like Oregano's spaghetti is better! Yes, I preferred a major chain over this.   The salad was luke warm, wilted and soggy. It made me wonder if this was left under the heat lamp with the spaghetti. The cheese pizza was gobbled by my 3 year old, so I'm glad he enjoyed himself quite well.  The rating would be lower if it wasn't for the great attitude of the waiter, but the food alone will not get me back.",

That being said, I feel like we haven't had the best experiences eating out since moving to Phoenix two years ago. After a friend came here for his anniversary and raved about it, we decided to give it a try. We cook a lot of Italian food at home and weren't sure what to expect. Holy cow were we blown away. We were greeted immediately at the door by the hostess who sat us at a clean spacious table on the patio. The waitress came over promptly with waters and took our drink order. The owner, Ross, came over and turned on a heater for us just as it was getting a little chilly. Our drinks and appetizers arrived quickly and our entrees came out shortly after. I got the Alfredo and added meatballs (maybe a little weird, I don't care!) while my boyfriend got the chicken alla vodka. Our food was phenomenal and the portions were generous. We so look forward to coming back here and I will be recommending The Strand to everyone.",

No one checks on me .. I wait.  I wait.   I wait 25 maybe 30 minutes and.. bam!! every item hits my table at once. I politely say. \"Everything is going to get cold\" The waitress blatantly says \"that's the way it came out\" and Walks away.. Doesn't even say I'm sorry not does she offer to keep anything warm. She actually doesn't seem to really give a shit at all and just kind of walks away. To top it off, I jump out of my seat and hear her under her breath , thinking I'm not behind her; talking shit about me to the manager.  I don't come to a \"fine\" establishment like this for my food to not be coursed appropriately l, AND to be talked down about.  I might be young, and I might not be the prettiest, but I know what good customer service is, and what hospitality means.  I will not be spending any more of my money elsewhere.   I won't drop any rude descriptions about the people working tonight but I just posted this as I walked out the door so management look at your schedule and see who my server was.",

And when I finally proceeded to let them know we had a party of 3, I was very disrespectfully informed that the only seating available was outside due to reservations.   Ok, I get it. We came on a night where there wasn't just one, but 2 events. I get that you have reservations. But it was...4:45 p.m. And not a soul in sight. Literally. Except us...and the wait staff. And maybe 2 or 3 people at the bar.   But I don't need your attitude. I would appreciate a polite greeting and a respectful interaction regarding the evenings' situation.   I gave 2 stars in light of the fact that our waitress was professional and had a great attitude, along with the fact that the food was good as well.",

I ordered the chicken parmesan and substituted the sauce and pasta type as I was informed it would be no problem. Absolutely delicious and extremely flavorful. The rest of my part ordered, the butternut squash, pizza, and lasagna. No complaints all around. The restaurant was kind enough to put together a little birthday dessert and it ended the night perfectly!   The service was fast and the overall experience was amazing, I wish I lived closer as it would be a frequent visit for me.",

    "text": "Interesting ambiance inside and ok sidewalk seating street presence but it was John the outside waiter who makes being there worthwhile. We ordered the mussels and clams in the garlic wine sauce - very well cooked and tasty and paired well with my glass of Chianti. Next the strands and meatballs - light tomato sauce with an interesting flavor, not your Italian Gramma's recipe but it was tasty. Entrees are served with bread and a chilled avocado pesto blend sauce that was tasty as well. Don't bother with the blackberry lemon vodka drink unless you like Koolaid. John did his best to make the drink more palatable by adding limoncello and more vodka but it just made it taste more alcoholic rather than a nice blend of tasty. If this place upped its specialty drinks game and perhaps added veal to the menu it might be a 4 star establishment, but there's something about the place that just doesn't hit the mark. Can't put our fingers on it. I mean, it wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't terrific either. Very sad.",

There was so much cheese in our dish and the flavor was good, but not great. The restaurant was packed with high energy and lots of people and I could see it was a great place to mingle.   For me and my husband, I don't think we would seek out this restaurant specifically just to have dinner since we already have a list of restaurants we would be happy to drive to and dine at.

The food I had was here AWESOME!   My coworker and I split the fried zucchini and it was good, nothing special about it but it was still good, but my dinner however was what made this place great. I was debating between the pork chop and the crab linguine, but when the waitress came over I asked her what she would pick between the two. Now I know its sometimes not great to ask the waiter/waitress about what's good because they may like something that you may not like but this waitress recommended I try a special that they usually do not have. I'm the type of person who will usually take a chance and was I glad I did. She recommend that I try the seafood risotto which had shrimp, clams, scallops, and a lobster tail on top of a creamy and cheesy risotto.   Best risotto I have ever had and if this place was in my hometown I would go there very time I had the chance too just so I could have this entree. The other plates my coworkers had were also very delicious.   The reason I gave this place a 4 out of 5 stars was because the service was not that great. We had a large party at our table and our waitress went around the table taking our orders however she forgot to come back to someone and take their order. She also took one side of the table, put that order in and then took the other side. Due to that mistake our table did not get all of their food at the same time, plus that person who she forgot got their food much later, granted it was also kind of their fault for not remembering to order but still...  with all of that said I would still recommend trying this place out when your in phoenix, just make sure they have the risotto :)",

The only issue I had at this location was with the hostess who i had an unfortunate incident with. First they dont take reservations which is fine, i get it, second they have no way of letting people who check in for a table know that their table is ready which is not of this age. We arrive and are told that our wait is 25 min which again is fine. We literally step inside the restaurant next door and come back in 7 min to find that our name was called and our table was taken..which is weird because they made no effort to find us. I then asked the hostess, a young girl, how long are wait was going to be and she literally said \"i dont know\" . My next words to her were \"as a hostess you should typically know how long the wait is\". Fast forward to her telling me she didnt like my tone to her going to get her manager and then the manager asking me why his hostess was crying in the back about a disgruntled customer.   i was not disgruntle and it is the hostess responsibility aka job to know this information. The manager i could tell agreed with me as he simply got us sat down in the next 5 min with no further issue and again the food, the waiter were great.   if your going to have a hostess please make sure she is emotionally stable and can handle her job.",

My boyfriend had the Lobster Mac n' Cheese. Said the lobster didn't taste fresh and the sauce was too rich. Ernie, the manager came over and introduced himself. He explained the remodel from the previous concept.  We'll definitely come back to support a local place at CityScape. I just hope to see some improvements in the food.",

I'll admit I've found some awesome Italian food in Phoenix!  The Strand has traditional, scrum-diddly-umptious Italian Food in Phoenix, Arizona... 1/2 OFF Happy Hour is the best... Bartenders are sweet, great drinks... The lobster mac n cheese is everything you could want. I love seafood pastas and this is probably one of the tastiest dishes at The Strand..  They also cater!!! I was enthralled as I am constantly searching for affordable, amazing, creative caterers... They will be at Search Control's event at the ASBA headquarters, if you're not there for the internet marketing event, you'll be there for The Strand's awesome italian food (:",

My first time I had the marguerite pizza and wedge salad. The salad was creative and fresh. Pizza was too thin and kind of soggy for my taste, but still tasted good, especially if you like thin pizza. The other day for lunch I tried the grilled chicken sandwich. . The menu is typical but there are a few creative things that stand out. I've never had to wait and the waiters are very attentive and friendly. The interior is surprisingly roomy, casual, comfortable, very clean. Good place for a business lunch or casual dinner. I plan to go back a few more times. They are now serving brunch too!",

The location is good (cityscape), and the decor inside is really cute, with these lamps that kinda look like they're made out of spaghetti (a STRAND of spaghetti, I'd say). Prices are about what you'd expect - $15ish for a pasta plate. Unfortunately, the food just isn't great. The standout of the evening was actually the drunken bread, which we gobbled up quite quickly. After that, the pasta primavera and chicken alfredo were just bland, and the sausage pizza was actually not good. They're going for the artisan/napoleon style (I think), but instead of being delicious and chewy, the crust was just soggy and limp. The cheese and sausage toppings were no better. It's an ok place if you have no other option, but in downtown phx, you have many other options. I won't be returning.",

Friends had the much recommended Lobster Mac and Cheese and neither finished their plates...kept saying it was very fishy.  I had the chicken piccata, which did not come with nor was I offered soup or salad as the menu says.  Very salty dish and did not finish it.  One other person had the Linguini Pomodoro and she said it was \"ok\".  Apparently the air conditioner wasn't working because it was extremely warm inside and we actually had words with the hostess when she kept closing the big door.  Most likely won't be back...this was one of those try and not again places.",

Not once during this time were we greeted by our wait staff and noticed the other tables started placing orders.

The decor in the restaurant is nice, makes you wanna just hang out and have some wine and good food. I started with the crispy calamari that was served with two great sauces. The calamari was super tender and crispy, perfectly executed! I ended up going with the Prosciutto and Egg pizza, that was decent. I prefer my pizza more crisp and the eggs over easy. This pizza could have been awesoe, but the crust wasn't nearly crispy enough and the eggs seemed more scrambled. With egg on my pizza, the best part is the runny yoke on the pie, which this lacked. I'll definitely come back and give it another shot. Chalk this up as another win for Cityscape!",

    "text": "The patio area was the perfect place to enjoy dinner with a few friends.  After a few drinks upstairs, my group decided to stop here for a quick dinner before driving home.  It was perfect for our group, since it soon became about 15 people from the event upstairs.  I must say service was on the slow side, but with only one server, late night hours, and on a weekday, I give them credit.  Most likely they don't get crowds of 15 people late at night on a weekday.    Well I know it was worth the wait.  We enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese, calamari, and I had the opportunity to consume The Strand burger.  The Strand burger is a half pound of meat, Gorgonzola cheese or switch to Cheddar if need be, red onion, lettuce, and a tomato.  The Parmesan cheese fries were perfect to pass around.  Plenty of fries to share and the burger is such a large portion most will have to take some home.  I would say a great bargain for $10.    The lobster mac and cheese was a hit at our table.  Plenty of people tried it and even some who normally do not consume seafood said it was delicious.  I cannot comment on it, since I have a food allergy to it.  However based on my groups comments and general \"it's good\" after taking a first bite I must encourage you to try it.  Yes good food does cost a bit more, but $15 for lobster infused mac and cheese seems reasonable.    The restaurant is located right in cityscape, which is the heart of downtown Phoenix.  It has great decor and a great location.  I suggest the patio if the weather is right.  Views of the city, people, and environment makes for great entertainment while you dine.",

PARKING TIP: Eating at a restaurant gives you a two hr validation while stand up live gives a three hr window. We only parked for less than 5hrs but they will only accept one block of hrs for free so we had to pay $5. The way to avoid it would be to pull out of garage and then right back in to get a new parking pass for the comedy show.",

    "text": "The Strand...The Strand... oh boy I had high hopes for this place because of the location and just the overall ambiance of the place. After searching on Yelp for some Italian places in the area my co workers and I all agreed on The Strand. Within walking distance from the Kimpton Palomar we took a short walk down to have a nice dinner.  Upon arriving, there was not a soul in sight and we were greeted immediately from the host who was pretty nice. I'm not sure if they aren't really use to large parties but a group of 13 we thought wasn't that bad. Our server was super sweet and she was i luck of having a party of this size on her first day.   After taking all of our drink orders we all collectively were sold on the frozen house margaritas! I mean how can you turn down a $5 drink deal? When they came out they were packed with some punch that's for sure! When it came to our food it was a different story.. now granted I know our party size was considered large but the time frame we had to wait for it was a bit excessive especially due to the fact that nobody was even in the place when we first arrived. Once food started coming out we had a ton of wrong orders and missing items you name it.   Nobody ordered anything that could've been labeled as difficult so we weren't too sure how the hiccups in the kitchen were even happening. My dish in particular was one that consisted of a quinoa salad and salmon on top. When I received it, there was no salmon and my co worker who ordered chicken in her Alfredo didn't get any chicken lol like huh?!   Baffled as we were I had to request the manager because it was a bit insane how we had to wait the length of time that we did and to have the stuff come out all wrong. After the manager apologized we received the things that we didn't originally and the night went on. When the checks came that was another process and that Topic i will digress on.",

I have walked by here when it was super busy, so I am happy it wasn't as crowded as I have seen. Either way, wonderful decor and vibe, and Sarah (the manager) happened to be our waitress. She was awesome, super friendly, explained the menu and answered our questions! Even when we ordered she made suggestions that maybe we hadn't considered (and we all ended up saying yes to something she suggested). We got garlic cheese bread which was good, the marinara it came with tasty! Side salads, sangria, and we all enjoyed our entrees! My noodles were cooked perfect, the flavors were good, and it was a very nice time! It's not that expensive, sort of around Olive Garden prices, but the food it WAYYYYYY wayyyyy better!

    "text": "My friend brought me here this weekend after First Friday and several minutes of searching for Italian food on yelp. The atmosphere is great (the light fixtures are a little weird...) yet we chose to sit outside on the patio. Our waitress was great and friendly which seemed to be common traits for the staff there. The drinks were nice and strong which was a plus and they weren't insanely expensive. So you're probably wondering why a 3/5 if all of those things were great, right?   The food.   We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer (not knowing we get complimentary bread anyway...not their fault though). What we expected and what came out were two different things. It tasted like bread that just had cheese melted on top of it. We didn't taste any garlic and it wasn't toasted (there was no crunch when biting into it). The marinara sauce was great though. My friend ordered the Caesar salad with chicken and after eating a few pieces of chicken, he said it didn't taste good. I can't remember if he said it was rubbery or if it tasted like plastic. He asked me to try it but no thanks. I ordered the Bolognese and I loved all the cheese that was put on top. There's no such thing as too much cheese. That's where the happiness ended for me though, right after that layer of cheesy goodness. The dish itself wasn't anything special and I feel I could have made something better at home.   I'd come back for the drinks, service, and cheese but that's about it.",

Service- the order and deliver process was very smooth and easy. Only took about 30/45 minutes before the guy delivered our food. He came up to our hotel room as well so that was nice.   Food:  Chicken ala vodka- my mom and I shared this and neither of us were impressed. Very bland in flavor. And extremely small portion for the price. I mean for almost $20 an meal it should be a lot tastier and much bigger portion.   Shrimp Alfredo( I believe this is what it was) - our friend ordered this and again she said it was very bland and needed way more flavor. And also extremely small portion.   Lobster Mac- our other friend got this and had a stomach ache the rest of the night. She actually left the convention early and stayed in her room the rest of the evening because she felt so sick. Which was a bummer because it was our last night all together.   I don't want to give it one star because that doesn't seem entirely fair but none of us were impressed. Seemed like a huge rip off. We paid $80 for 4 meals and none of them were the size they should've been. They didn't even cover the bottom of the to go container. Don't think any of us would choose this on our future visits to Phoenix.",

We wish the bread was warm and toasted like most places in Texas.   Okay well we came in right before closing around 930pm and they close at 10pm. We were swated right away because no one else was in there. The waitress was very nice and sweet. We placed our drink orders and i had a house maragarita and my wife had a Chardonnay. She is an advid wine drinker and thought the Chardonnay was not good. She liked my Margarita but i did not. Too sweet and not enough Twang.   On to the food. I had the Chicken Alla Vodka pasta.  Looked really good but subpar at best. Had to add tons of salt and black pepper to get some reminiscence of flavor. My wife had the chicken and broccli Alfredo pasta in which the pasta comes plain and you have to add Chicken and Broccoli  at an addtional cost. She too had to add salt and pepper to make it edible. As dar as freshness the chicken on both our dishes were skinny and looked like the chicken was frozen when added to our dishes. The chicken WAS firm and tasted like freezer. My wifes broccoli tasted like Hospital veggies or even the steamables that you buy from walmart.   LONG STORY SHORT MY WIFE ENDED UP SICK AND NAUSEOUS FROM THIS PLACE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. ONLY REASON FOR THE 2 STAR IS BECAUSE OF THE NICE WAITRESS. Nice atmosphere i guess",

The waitress told me that I could get a Caesar salad or calamari but not combined, I explained that wasn't what the sign said. She checked and told me I was right.   I'm not sure what I expected but I figured it would be more imaginative than a small portion of limp romaine with too much store-bought Caesar dressing on it, topped with regular old breaded/fried calamari rings. Sadly, that was exactly what it was. Turns out the waitress wasn't far from wrong. Basically a sub-standard Caesar with calamari rings on top instead of on a separate plate. Probably would have been better to order them separately and just thrown the rings on top. At least the salad would have been bigger.",

    "text": "Alright so The Strand. First dinner in Phoenix, and I gotta say it was alright. Contrary to what other reviews have said, I thought the food was pretty good. What really kept it from being a great dining experience was the service. We ordered 2 caesar salads($10 each) and 3 pizzas(about $12 each) for the 4 of us, but it took a good long while for our grub to come out.  Though they were very busy, it did feel like we were forgotten from time to time.  After about 15 minutes of no food or help from our server, our salads arrived. Both caesar's had a ton of cheese, and the serving size was fairly large. Overall, the salad was alright.  After another 10 minutes of waiting, I let out a sigh of relief--the pizzas finally came. I mean, I was just glad we got them at all! We ordered two fig and prosciutto pizzas and one chicken, artichoke and bacon pizza. These were medium sized, and each had a good amount of toppings on it. The crust was a nice thin dough with the perfect amount of chew. All of the toppings complimented each other nicely. I'll be honest, the pizza was the main attraction of the meal.  So pretty much, though the food was pretty lit and the atmosphere was interesting, the service was real dodgy. So would I come back here? Eh, probably not. There are just a ton of other restaurants in Phoenix, or even in Tempe that probably have bettering service. But like I said, that's not to say that the food wasn't good. Anyway, that's all I gotta say. Hope this was in someway helpful. Cheers!",

For being downtown near major venues, especially during the holiday season, we expected it to be busy. But we did not expect the service to literally forget & neglect us. We opted to sit on the patio, it being less crowded. However- once we were sat, we sat for 30+ minutes without anything but menus. No water. Multiple servers were attending tables around us... we got up to walk out.   John happened to stop us, and was MORE than helpful/attentive. Had it not been for him, we would have left. Just needing a brief but decent meal before our show, we were able to have some delicious small plates- the food is GREAT! Butternut squash ravioli was the best I have ever had.   But still, throughout the entire experience- John was the only reason this place gets the stars it does, along with the food. Not at ALL impressed with how rude the rest of the wait staff was, literally ignoring us, visually noticing us sitting there making eye contact attempting to get at least a glass of water! None of the 3 ladies standing at the hostess station did much besides point to the patio & say, \"sorry we are busy someone will eventually be with you\". The staff, besides John, needs some serious instruction on customer service.   But thank you to the kitchen for some excellent dishes, and most thanks to John! Really appreciate his effort in turning the experience around & genuinely caring for his customers. We all understand how hectic weekend evenings can be, especially during the holiday season, but this was one of the first times I have actually gotten up to walk out from a place- so we want to make sure John receives highest compliments because the food was great & HE made the difference between a total flop.   I'd really like to return & try more of the menu- the food is absolutely great with a decent variety, plenty to choose from as well as reasonably priced. I just can't say I am eager to immediately return after the major lack of customer service. Please take some notes from John- total pro & saved the evening/review!",

    "text": "Today's my coworker's last day and she picked this restaurant for her farewell lunch so I called last Wednesday to book a party of 20 people for today at noon. The girl I spoke to asked for my number and a name for the reservation and ok'd it.  We arrived to The Strand today  at noon and I saw the tables I had specified we wanted were all taken already so right away I realized we had a problem (this is a small restaurant and it's packed during lunch, that's why I called in advance to make sure we got those tables specifically.  We've been there before and we know we won't be able to sit together unless we get those tables.  In fact, every time we go we're a large group and we always get the exact same tables).  These two girls we spoke to today had no idea what I was talking about. I'm talking about a reservation for 20 people! Anyway, it looks like someone dropped the ball big time. I feel bad for the girls we spoke to today because they obviously had no idea and they tried to sit us on different tables but the only reason why I called 48h in advance was to get the 4 tables next to the entrance so we would be sitting somehow together (which I requested specifically).  Sitting on different tables scattered all over the restaurant just makes no sense.   I didn't get the name of the person I spoke to last Wednesday (it was a girl, that's all I can say) but she took my phone number and said the reservation was fine for today at noon. And I just checked their phone number again to make sure I called the right restaurant because the girls we spoke to today kept asking if I was sure I had called The Strand that's Downtown and yes, that's the restaurant I called.  We like their food and the ambiance of this restaurant but we ended up moving the party to The Corner instead (which was upsetting because that wasn't the place our coworker had picked) and they were extremely accommodating, we all sat together and enjoyed a nice lunch and a nice review's on their way now.  I understand this was an honest mistake and the girls we spoke to aren't the ones to blame for this but they may want to get a better system to reserve tables so they don't have another big group of customers bring their business somewhere else.",

The calamari gave me a horrible stomach bug. The crab linguine was room temperature and not hot but if it had more heat it would have been amazing. The waiter did not smile and all most seemed it was a issue serving us. Maybe he was having a bad day. Last thing that irritated my friends was that 4 girls were staring at us while we were waiting for our food. We looked over the smiled and then turned away. Keep in mind these are employees.

I learned of The Strand while searching the worldwide interweb for dinner plans.  We arrived about 5:15 on a Tuesday, so it was not at all crowded. It did, however, mostly fill up while we were there.  The calamari was okay, but I would not place it in my Top 3. Not bad, just not shout-worthy. The Angry Shrimp was excellent and not too spicy in our opinions. The seafood linguine was delicious! Mussels and scallops and shrimp (oh, my!) were not over- or under-cooked, and the pasta was terrific. We opted for a bottle of Cabernet / Merlot / Syrah ('Super Tuscan') which was just right. Kudos to Ashley for outstanding service.  We're going to another concert in about a week, and I'm pretty sure I know where dinner will be....",

We talked about dating apps and what we did in our free time. He makes apps for fun that help little kids learn and it was like a neon sign had appeared over his head that flashed hearts.

    "text": "Prepare yourself for a tale that is too confusing for the hungry mind, and too funny to actually take seriously. Put yourself in the shoes of a young woman late one night after a busy day at comicon in downtown Phoenix.... It was a dark nighr, the street was filled with nerds in their Avanegers T-shirt's and other relevant nonsense. Something like this hasn't occurred exactly like this, and may never again.   Say, for example, one orders a prosciutto and fig pizza... one would, in fact, expect to receive a prosciutto and fig pizza. However, to the dismay of the hungry young female, the surprise was after receiving the pizza and being puzzled for several moments... the prosciutto was nowhere in sight. Was it hidden underneath the melted cheese blanket? Was it chopped up so finely it was not possibly visible with the naked eye? Nein. Try wrapping your head around the fact that tonight, the prosciutto does not exist. The chef, apparently having run out of prosciutto earlier in the night, and not having told a single soul this fun fact, sent a prosciutto and fig pizza out of the kitchen which was in fact prosciutto-less. If you've ever tried eating a cheese pizza with figs on it, you'll understand (it's gross).  It's like a sick joke where you're left baffled for the rest of the evening. It's like... ordering a pizza with two main ingredients and the chef only hooks you up with one and hopes you don't notice.   Also the sangria was okay but not sure if there was actually any alcohol in it. Service wasn't very good either.",

    "text": "Well we decided to stop by here while walking around downtown. It's definitely a little place atleast in the outside but very nice inside with a couple tv's and very nice decor and ambience. Now as for food our group got a lot of different items so let me see if I can remember everything.   1. Pepperoni Pizza - It was definitely a good pizza and definitely filling , they did have several options and toppings but decided to just go simple and would definitely order again.  2.Lasagna - This was definitely a nice size slice and very filling as well , now I didn't eat this but was told it was very good and would absolutely Ofer again.  3.Chicken Parmesan- this was a huge portion 2 pieces of chicken parm which seemed to be 1 big one butterflyed and with penne pasta , this was really good and definitely had leftovers in this plate.  4.The Strand Burger - Overall a good size burger served with the Parmesan fries and added bacon and cheese which was 16$ after adding cheese and bacon still not a bad deal for a good burger.  5.Creamy Alfredo & Ceaser Salad - 2 people split these items and they were definitely nice size portions and they said they did like the food I forgot to take a pic of the salad but I think I was able to get almost everything else.   Overall a great place for some good sized Italian food , service was very good and attentive.",

    "text": "We wanted more. We wanted better. The Strand has great potential, but it's lacking in many areas.   We came here this past Monday around 5:15, during Happy Hour. The Arrogant Butcher next door beckoned, but the decor and menu here caught our attention (photos).   The Strand has an upscale, hipster bar feel to it (see photos). It's located near Taking Stick Arena, where the Phoenix Suns play; so I guess they get a decent tourist trade.  But on this recent Monday, there were busy with mostly locals from the downtown Condos and office buildings.   We were seated somewhat quickly and had a good view of the entire place. Our waters came quickly, followed by our wine. Our server shifted from between being attentive, to MIA a few times. But what we really didn't like was all the cigarette smoke coming in from their outdoor seating along the sidewalk. So much for city smoking ordinances. LOL  We started with their Mozzarella and Tomato drizzled balsamic Caprese Dish. The cheese seemed m'eh, while the plum tomato's were unripened store bought. Not a good start, though the balsamic was very tasty and not tart.   Next up was our entrees of Chicken Marsala and Pasta Bolognese. The pasta was incredibly tasty!  A must if you come here.  Got to have it.   Okay about the chicken... I substituted the garlic mashed potatoes for some angel haired pasta. What came out was soup and that is no exaggeration, though I wished it was. See the photos. Lost under that mount of mush, was some sauteed spinach. Huh?  Our meal ran us forty dollars each, including gratuities.  I guess the Line Cooks were in charges that night and couldn't figure it out.  As I wrote, we wanted more, we wanted better. We did find their Chocolate Lava Cake to be delicious though.   Oh, well.   Two Stars overall.",

    "text": "After our jaunt at Cityscape's Ice Skating rink, we finally decided to hang it up and have some dinner.  I had wanted to take a long walk towards the San Carlos, however, there was a lot of smoke in the air. It seemed that some vandals had done something with the heaters they have around the place and it was causing the smoke. My Beloved was not able to handle it due to her asthma. Therefore we went around the block and discovered a restaurant tucked behind Arrogant Butcher. It wasn't my first choice, but since we'd never eaten there before, I figured that we should give it a try.  For a Saturday, it wasn't too busy. I was hoping that wasn't a sign. We were seated promptly after we checked in. After perusing the menu, we  saw some interesting items that we wanted to try, not knowing how everything was going to turn out.  For starters, we had the Clams and Mussels. What better way to vet a restaurant than to try seafood as an opening dish. They didn't do so well in this area. I am not sure who was minding the kitchen, but there had to be better quality control on the clams and mussels. Most of the shells were devoid of actual clams. If I wanted to order clam and mussel shells, I would've stated so. Additionally, the mussels were overcooked and too chewy for our taste.   Then our main courses arrived. After the appetizer debacle, I was happily surprised my Salmon layered on a bed of grilled vegetables. The Salmon was nice and tendered, with a wonderful grilled flavor. The vegetables were not overdone, and were quite succulent. It was good enough to the point that it was devoured in relatively short order.  My wife's Quinoa and Broccoli was not so appetizing. She doesn't like overly pungent odors from her food, and for some reason the dish had a rather sour smell to it. Although the smell was strong, the flavoring wasn't. The whole dish was exceedingly bland and boring. She thought it could have used more garlic, or perhaps a bit of fresh tomato and more cheese.   And towards the end of our meal, our server finally brought the Bread and Pesto. Correct me of I'm wrong, but shouldn't this normally be brought out towards the beginning of the meal, along with the appetizer?  Our server was nice enough, even with the miscue on the bread. She just seemed overwhelmed with her myriad of duties, despite the fact that the restaurant was not busy. We tipped her generously, nonetheless.  All in all, it was a decent experience. However, we won't be making a return trip anytime soon.",

I was out celebrating a friend and her accomplishments and we ended up here for a cute Italian dinner. I ordered the shrimp scampi and it was surprisingly delicious. The pasta was in a nice white wine sauce with a hint of lemon but not too much. The shrimp very well seasoned and had almost a charred tasted that I enjoyed.   Each meal is served with soft bread and olive oil to dip it in. The olive oil is very high quality and the bread is like clouds with a light flaky crust.  I would definitely reccomended this downtown eattery as a great italian spot to visit when in phoenix for sure.",

The whole menu looks good- mostly traditional, classic Italian restaurant fare- but I always end up with the fig pizza. It's probably the weirdest thing on the menu but it's an amazing blend of flavors. Someday I'll get a pasta. I've heard good things from the friends I've been with.   Their drink menu is more out of the ordinary than the food. I was introduced to this place because of their good deal on a good margarita. My favorite is their cherry limeade, though. It's so refreshing on a hot day. Or a Phoenix winter day, honestly. It's just always good.   The reason I consider this place five stars is their service and affordability to fanciness ratio. It's in a cute area full of kinda pricey food yet manages to be classy but not too expensive. I brought a squad of poor graduate students here in full black tie attire before a special event because of that perfect balance and we had a fabulous, within-budget time.    I'd recommend sitting indoors due to noise outside and attractive space inside, but they have patio space on the corner that has a quasi-European cafe vibe. I've only ever had great service, even when a friend and I showed up with pizza cravings less than an hour before they closed. They never seem rushed and it makes the whole thing feel a little more special. Alla prossima!",

    "text": "Excellent food! My husband and I went here on date night. We were downtown for a show so we thought we would give it a try. We started with calamari. It was very lightly breaded and had a creamy, lightly spicy dipping sauce. I decided to try the spinach, chicken and bacon pizza. It had a white sauce instead of red. The crust was thin and crispy. The flavors were married together great. It was just the right size to bring home some for lunch the next day. My husband had chicken piccata. He said the chicken was a little rubbery. But the flavor was excellent. We finished dinner with bread pudding. We were a little disappointed.  It was dry so we probably wouldn't order that again. We will definitely come again if we are downtown.",

    "text": "Went in for a lunch on a Friday. Getting a table quickly was definitely not an issue, although a couple of people mentioned how odd it was that the hostess never really acknowledged us by speaking to us.   Our server was very straight forward and to the point when it came to taking our order and serving us; no fluff, no small talk. Some prefer that while others could deem that as borderline rude, certainly depends on on what you prefer. No complaints here.   I ordered the chicken piccata with mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. The chicken was incredibly bland, drowned in a lemon sauce with the consistency of a thicker gravy. I really did enjoy the potatoes and the 'lemon gravy' paired very nice with the mashed potatoes. The spinach was also very good.   The price of a sit down meal in downtown Phoenix is definitely on par with this place. I'll note that there are other places to grab a better priced drink though.   All in all, if I am looking for a place where I'd like to grab a table and a meal without a wait, I'll come back.",

They have brown rice corn noodles as a gluten free option. My daughter was so excited that she could order gluten free Mac  and cheese. My son ordered a kids pizza, my husband got chicken parmigiana, and my other daughter and I split chicken alla vodka.  They brought all of our food except my husbands. By the time they brought it the rest of us were almost done with our food. It's a bummer to go to dinner and not actually get to eat together. The food tasted pretty good. I was not a fan of the squash and zucchini in the chicken alla vodka, or was a little too undercooked for my liking in a pasta dish.   So, overall the food the pretty good. The service was pretty good. Their timing needs some work.  Despite the timing on the dishes we will go back.",

    "text": "We were in town for a conference and always like to find interesting places to eat.  We had walked by The Strand out exploring and the menu looked good so we went back that evening for dinner. When we got there the place was packed so we were seated along a back wall at a nice comfortable two top. We loved the vibe and as soon as we settled in our waiter came by to take our drink orders. The Sangria was so refreshing as was the Italian margarita.  While eating the wonderful calamari we ordered for an appetizer, it became obvious the floor was understaffed but the food came out of the kitchen like clockwork and went to tables without delay.  John B, our waiter, did an amazing job answering questions, filling drinks, serving food in the most professional manner I've seen in quite some time.   The smoked gouda ravioli was delicious with the bolognese. It was a great combination of the smokey cheese with a balanced spicy sauce. The side salad with balsamic was fresh and cold when it arrived to the table. The bread was basic but worked well with the richness of the pasta. Overall a delightful meal made possible by a professional waiter.",

The food was non significant but not horrible. The salmon I order well came to the table medium rare. I ate two bites at the ends. The rest was inEdible. After paying our bill, my group of four noticed a cockroach as big as my thumb crawling against the wall. It made my skin crawl! I showed the slow crawling cockroach to the waitress. She didn't flinch. She signaled she saw the roach with a nod of her head the shouted out to someone by the kitchen as to signal \"another roach sighting\".   I will not be back every again. This morning my stomach is turning and I have been in the bathroom on and off. Not sure if it was the Angry Shrimp (which was too spicy to enjoy) or an indication of a nasty kitchen.

Me and a friend went about 2 weeks ago, we arrived late about 9ish and decided to sit at the bar. The bartender was amazing, she was great, she went over the menu with us and even informed us it was reverse happy hour and suggested some of her own favorite dishes on the menu.  I decided to go with their hamburger with parmesan french fries, yum! Their food portions are well worth it, the hamburger was huge and I got a plate full of fries, also the cheese garlic bread as an appetizer was delicious, not to mention their ice tea was amazing (and I'm a big tea drinker). We stayed quite sometime and I witnessed some guests still coming in close to closing time and the staff still seated them and served them instead of turning them away, that's giving good customer service.  I plan to go back and with friends soon, The Strand rocks in my book! Thank you guys at The Strand for giving me and my tummy a good time! :)",

    "text": "We ate here last Friday (6/6/14) with family and friends (6 of us in total). We were sat immediately when we entered. Since we wanted something quick, and \"cheap\" (lol, it's downtown Phoenix, nothing is \"cheap\" there!), this was the place we ended up at.  Inside they have high ceilings, and lamps that drop from them, the lamps were fun to look at and a great way to start a conversation. They have two large TV's on either side of the restaurant so you can watch the game at the bar or while eating. They also have an outdoor patio with misters if you want to eat outside.  The booths are made for large groups. Even small groups are grouped with other spots in the large booths, the only way to have an individual table is if you ate outside, or got a table for two along the wall. The Strand is almost a hole in the wall restaurant, it's thrown under Tilted Kilt, and sitting next to The Arrogant Butcher, so it's rather overlooked by a lot of foot traffic.  Their menu is large, everything from salads to pastas to pizzas and drinks thrown into the mix. Orders were: Chicken Alfredo, Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese, Burger, Salmon Dish, Salad.  I tried some of the Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese, it's spicy but good at the same time, it came to us with the cheese still bubbling and piping hot. The Chicken Alfredo is a simple dish, nothing to write home about, but I wanted something simple that night! I stole some of my mother's Parmesan fries from her plate, they didn't have a Parmesan taste, but they were really crispy and tasted good when dipped in their basil vinaigrette dip they bring to you with some bread while you wait for your meal to cook up.  Our waitress was a doll, she kept our cups filled and made sure we had everything. We chatted with the manager afterwards for a little bit too, if I'm in need for some easy Italian food around the Convention Center again, I'll be stopping by here!",

    "text": "My colleague and I decided to have dinner here as it had a varied menu and was right around the corner from our hotel. We had the bruschetta, balsamic salads, beef tortellini and lobster mac and cheese.  The bruschetta was flavorful and the right size for an appetizer and the salads were well balanced albeit a bit heavy on the dressing. The beef tortellini was perfectly cooked and the sage cream sauce was rich. The kitchen was also quite accommodating when we asked to add in some additional veggies to the tortellini. The.lobster mac and cheese was very cheesy and cream and there was a generous helping of lobster and bacon which was pleasantly surprising. The entree sizes were large and we had a hard time finishing them, though we wanted to eat it all.  The bar, on the other hand, left a bad taste on our mouth, literally. To start off the meal, my colleague ordered a sparkling water offered on the menu. The bottle she got was flat so she asked for the correct one. The waitress/hostess went to consult the bartender and came back with a new bottle of the same stuff claiming that was the sparkling water. We should have just given up then. However, we ventured to order a glass of pinot noir and a strawberry tessarosa martini. The wine was awful! It smelled and tasted sour as if it had been left sitting out too long without a cork and turned bad. And the martini tasted like watered down cranberry juice at the top and then became straight vodka at the bottom. There was also long muddled strawberries or basil in the drink as the description promised. Luckily our waitress/hostess was nice enough to take the glass of wine off the tab but I don't know how the bartender got the job.  Three star review because the food was delicious but the bar and service left something to be desired. They were understaffed that night though so I'll let them slide and the hostess coffee her best job.",

The second time was when I asked for a box. But overall,  good food.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying this place isn't BAD.....it's just not awesome. I went here on Friday night with the BF for a date and to use a Doozy Deal coup. We made reservations on opentable, which got us the table, but oddly, instead of confirming that we went to the restaurant, they cancelled our reservation. This was kind of annoying because we didn't get our points, but it could have been an honest mistake. We tried a variety of food including: arancini, drunken cheesy bread, strands w meatballs, and minestrone soup. We also got drinks- I got the Italian margarita and the BF got some white wine. His wine came out with cork or dust in it at first, but they replaced it when he told them. The marg was good, like an alcoholic slushee. The food was all pretty good...the minestrone had lots of veggies, but was on the salty side. The bread was a bit odd...did taste like wine, but I probably wouldn't order it again. The arancini were really good! They had some pancetta in it and came with a really tasty lemony sauce and a marinara. I only wish there were more of them! The 'strands' were good and the meatballs were juicy. The service was friendly but slow. Also, they brought all of our food out at the same time, which I didn't love because it made everything get cold before we got a chance to eat it...don't know why they wouldn't bring soup, then apps, then mains.....Overall, it was good...it just wasn't great....and I thought it was a bit overpriced. I would consider going back and giving them another try, especially for a happy hour or something.",

Nice modern ambiance in the restaurant, good selection of pastas, pizzas, wine, martinis and other drinks in the menu.  Very friendly service as well!  I don't know how Italian this dish is...but the Lobster mac & cheese is a must try!  Very tasty, cheesy and filling!  Chicken Alla Vodka was good too and they gave us a good portion of chicken.  Complementary bread was ok, but their pesto/vinegar dip was so good!  It's also perfectly fine to share a glass of wine...they serve it like Postinos.",

    "text": "Went to The Strand last night and was disappointed enough to write a review. It was our second visit in the past six months and it will certainly be our last. For starters, the temperature inside was too cool even though the outdoor temperature was only in the upper 40's. My meal was cold halfway into it and I am a pretty fast eater (my wife reminds me).  The bread came out and the appetizer plates were still wet. We opened our napkin rolls and the napkins were still damp as if they had been taken out of the dryer far too early. My leg became chilled from the damp cloth laying on it partially due to the chilly temperature of the restaurant and partially due to the damp cloth napkin. My wife was chilly enough to order a coffee prior to dinner. Upon telling the server that she was cold and needed a cup of coffee the response was only that they did not have coffee, only espresso. My wife ordered a tea that became cold fairly quickly and as I glanced up at the large drink menu behind the bar I saw that they had Cafe Americano listed. That would have been a good suggestion for a coffee substitute had our server been on her game. The appetizer, Risotto Arancini, was so-so. My wife's Meatballs and \"Strands\" was served warm but she felt as though the meatballs were previously frozen and not homemade. Nothing to write home about. My entree, Chicken Piccata, was lacking in the flavor department and as I previously mentioned was cold half way through trying to enjoy it. Apart from the restaurant being too cold there was nothing terrible about the experience it's just that is was a mediocre meal with less that professional service. The server that waited on the table next to us squatted down and rested his arms on one of the table's chairs to take their order. Unfortunately we see this a lot in our current society but I want a professional, well informed yet non-intrusive server that adds to the quality of the dinning experience. Not another dinner buddy. This was not \"A Unique Dining Experience\" that they self proclaim. Just over priced for the sub-par dining experience.",

Our table was never given bread, until we asked another server to grab it for us. I would not suggest this restaurant, unless average food and bad service is your forte.",

I have dined here more than once for lunch, but will not go back.  The last time I went the server brought an incorrect lunch order to me not once, but twice. (I am talking other guests' meals, not even close to my order.)  I finally ended up with the correct meal after 30 minutes.  Totally unacceptable, especially considering our table was only one of few occupied that afternoon.    Separately, I called to inquire about catering for a corporate event.  I botched the pronunciation of a word while quickly explaining my potential order to the manager.  He proceeded to laugh at me on of the phone and continue to use the word incorrectly to mock me.  I cannot imagine that their catering business is 'booming' so I'd suggest that their staff be a little more courteous to local patrons who are willing to give it a try.",

I expected top notch cause we PAID top Notch. My food was disgusting, my cheese was not melted and my plate was cold! My daughter had the chicken fingers which she didn't really eat cause the chicken had NO flavor what so ever and our waitress never came by to ask if she needed any condiments.

However, when we got here the hostess said it could possibly be an hour wait at least and we had a table of 13 people. To my surprise, we were sat after about a half hour! Our server Sarah came up and took our drink orders almost immediately and offered to split all of our checks for us. We have our food order right away since we were all starving and had been salivating over the menu before sitting down. Our appetizers (calamari) came out in less then 10 mins. And our meals showed up (I got the beef tortellini, my favorite) about 10 mins after that. I was beyond impressed that it all came out perfect and in a timely fashion considering the ridiculous hordes of people that were in the restaurant! All our orders were right and all of our drinks stayed filled the entire time! Sarah had a great personality and had a smile the whole time, regardless of the fact she was running around like crazy and she was efficient and got our bills out right when we asked! I will continue to come back and thank you for the great service!",

Although the portion sizes are enough to share, it didn't even cross our minds until after we had stuffed our faces. We had no problem devouring every last bite on our own. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing; robust, spicy, and plentiful. The meatballs were great, too. The salad was definitely enough for two and we will split that in the future.  The interior design and layout of the dinning area is very different, cool unlike any other place which is refreshing. The ordering process is very similar to Pei Wei but it works and was super easy. The owner was kind enough to stop by our \"pod\" and check in on us and was thrilled to share his design and dinning concept. He excitingly shared the story behind the commissioned panoramic photograph that takes up the majority of the north wall.  The lighting fixtures are also very cool, somewhat jellyfish like.   We are looking forward to our next dinning adventure. The online menu has been printed, reviewed and circulated.",

This place looks great inside, but there's a reason The Arrogant Butcher next-door was packed and this place was mostly empty.  We were in a hurry so had to choose this place. We ordered a simple salad w/ chicken and a sausage and mushroom pizza, they also brought us bread w/ pesto.  The pizza was ok, thanks to cheese and sausage, but bland sauce and crust. The chicken in the salad reminded me of McDonald's, the tomatoes looked old and warm.  The pesto was ok also, just too lemon-y for me.  We will not be back.",

I'm just saying it was surprising to see that many tiny tots out on a Friday night! I guess I got a different vibe during the Wine Walk when the place was crawling with happy winers! Their menu was not impressive and the drinks were not memorable.",

Great overall location if you're headed over to catch a Suns or Diamondbacks game.  It was hard to get a taste for overall ambience as we sat outside.

Called the restaurant to let them know and of course they said if I came back they'd make me a new one.  It's 95 degrees outside and I don't care to make the 10 minute walk again.

We ordered the calamari. No flavor. I wanted to order the risotto arancini but they no longer serve it. I also wanted the pancetta and pea pasta but it wasn't on the menu either. Luckily the waiter asked if they could make it and they did. It was ok but not what I'm use to. We also ordered a shrimp and bacon pizza. Not good at all. The signature dish the lobster Mac and Cheese was the only good thing that was ordered.    Will I go back. No. I do appreciate how nice the waiter was but considering there was only 2 other customers in at this time he could pay us the extra attention.",

    "text": "After enjoying several drinks at Lustre Bar, upstairs at Hotel Palomar, my friends, Aura C., Floyd C., and Linda, all were super hungry and decided to hit this place up to take care of that problem. What attracted me to this place? Something totally unrelated to food. The crazy looking noodle type chandeliers hanging from the ceiling! There were at least a dozen of them and you could spot them while driving by to find parking. I guess if you look at them from another angle, they could also look like jelly fish as I was told, but regardless, I was intrigued.  We asked to be sat on the patio since the evening weather was so pleasant, so they set up a table for 6 just in case a couple of more friends joined us. Little did we know that instead of 2 extra people, about 10-15 friends spotted us on the patio and ended up joining us! Although this was exciting for us, the restaurant was definitely not ready to accomodate this many people on a random weeknight, so the service was pretty slow.  I would give them notice next time to be fair, since there was already another big group inside being served.  As everyone enjoyed their drinks, Aura and I shared the Lobster Mac and Cheese. We loved this dish so much! We will return to order this again! Linda ordered the calamari to munch on, and that was also very good! Those are the only two things we tried though, so I'm curious to know what the other food is like since the Lobster Mac and Cheese was so addicting!  Kudos to The Strand for being so accomodating on short notice! I like your stylish decor and the tasty appetizers!",

The staff had displayed our minimal decor and even arranged for a separate dessert/gift table without us even asking for it. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive. Most importantly, the food and drinks were great! The menu was served family style as we were 75 people. We had margherita pizzas, calamari, bruschetta, balsamic and caprese salads, bolognese, alfredo with chicken, smoked gouda and vegetable ravioli and chicken picatta. Considering the majority of our guests are Sicilian, they can be tough food critics when it comes to eating Italian food but everyone was very complimentary! The owner, Adam, even made the scheduling and planning process very easy. Thanks again Adam to you and your staff for a wonderful evening!",

    "text": "First time visiting this place and wasn't impressed. It first started when we sat down and the hostess gave us the utensils. The utensils had hair on the napkin of which we picked off and kept browsing our menus because it wasn't a big issue to us. We ordered our drinks and food and carried on. I ordered their Tuscan Tea which is supposedly like a Long Island Iced Tea. It wasn't very good because it seemed watered down. We had Calamari as an appetizer and it was very rubbery and didn't seem authentic at all but was okay in taste. Once we received our food is why I'm writing this review. I ordered the Bistecca (which is steak)medium and it tasted like they boiled the steak and didn't bother to season it! It did  look like a good medium steak though. My friend's food though?!.........He ordered the Lasagna and as he started chewing on his first bite he realized that he couldn't break down a particular part. He thought it was cheese but it was actually HAIR! He sent it back and they remade it. They offered us a free dessert but their dessert menu is limited and it wasn't something that we wanted. Once we declined the offer they didn't offer to discount ANYTHING which is disturbing to me! My friend and I have decided that we'd never return here because the food was just okay and the fact that the customer service, after finding hair in his food, didn't result in some kind of compensation is a negative experience.",

The menu is very simple and not at all overwhelming. The staff is... Somewhat friendly. They can certainly work on being a little more friendly.  I ordered the linguini pomodoro which was really good. Before each meal, there's bread to snack on. The food came out really quick (I did, however, come a little after they opened). The waitress, Emily, was a sweet lady and made sure I was taken cared of, had water in my glass, and didn't make me feel rushed. The first time I came here, the waitress gave me my bill practically when my meal came. Emily didn't make me feel rushed and I actually got to order dessert.  The only thing that needs to change is the friendliness of the staff. They seem to look bored and would rather be any where else but there and it makes me feel sort of guilty for bothering them. Otherwise, great food and great drinks.",

I was surprised that we were seated so promptly given that other restaurants around were majorly busy.  There was a good amount of people there but service was prompt and our waitress wasn't too overbearing.    Honestly, I don't remember what I ordered only because it was mediocre.  Whatever it was tasted bland... well, more like blahhhh... and for the amount of money we spent, definitely not worth it.  I think this spot has a lot of potential.  I mean, it's in a great location, in the middle of the hustle and bustle of downtown Phoenix but the menu and its items could use some improvement.  I think I'll just stick to Arrogant Butcher next time (right next door).",

Our server was extremely slow, had no idea about what beer and wine they served, and didn't even know which of the wines that were ordered were red or white. She kept asking us \"what color is that one?\" Which I found pretty ridiculous.  The food was good though. I would suggest the pizzas as a group of us split a bunch of the different pizzas and every one of them was really good. I would say give it a try and hopefully you'll have better service than we did.",

This was horrible service for a order, and sit down and be served kind of place. None of the servers knew what was going on with their tables. My boyfriend canceled part of his order after wait 35 minutes for it. I would of loved to have canceled mine, since they couldn't nail the whole concept of put the cold meat balls in the microwave longer, even on the second try. The table next to us was complaining up a storm for the same reason. I kept waiting for my boyfriends' meal to come out, so we could eat together, it never came out. He ate part of my cold meal , and we left hungry, that is after he stood in line for 15 minutes to get his entree taken off the bill. I ordered the primavera, it sounded better than it tasted, the meatballs might of been good , but they were so cold they didn't have a great deal of taste. Would have to be desperate and see no crowd to ever go back there again.",

It was fairly empty, and far more casual than I had imagined. That's not a bad thing by the way. Cute decor!!! I had the chicken parm with penne pasta which was good..my husband had the chicken parm pizza, which he also enjoyed. Our friend sent back the chicken for her dish..she felt it was slightly pink...and they fixed the issue asap. Nice service and dessert was pretty good too. We had the cookie with ice cream combo. I'm sure on game nights this spot will be jumping. OH, and they validate parking for the garage..very handy.",

Food was outstanding...but I have a hard time forgetting that it took nearly one hour to have one dish of pasta delivered to our table. I understand that they were busy and I respect that....However my dish was brought to the table barely warm and I had to send it back to get reheated twice.  Yes I like my food hot...While we were not in a rush as we arrived plenty of time early for the Cirque du Soleil show...One server was outstanding while the others seemed completely indifferent and in over their heads.  Caesar salad was great...but then again that's one in my book that's hard to mess up.  Pasta with meat sauce was very tasty even though it was sent back to the kitchen twice.  The lines can be quite long. I do truly believe that The Strand has formidable potential and is a fantastic concept. The only problems I see is the lack of staff, and cooking Italian in a snap is a difficult task as the menu is quite diverse....Add to that long lines of customers out the door and a recipe for chaos can quickly simmer up...",

They told us when we walked in that they were no longer serving dinner, only appetizers, salads, and pizza, which was fine with us: my wife wanted a salad and I wanted pizza.   We sat on the patio and our waitress was right over to take our drink orders, and then back a few minutes later with our wine. My wife ordered the salmon salad, and I had the chicken pizza. The waitress came back a few minutes later to report that they were out of salmon, so she ordered the pear salad.   Our food came, and although the pizza looked good, it was just okay. The big slice of chicken breast on the pizza made it hard to eat...maybe shredded chicken would be easier. The pizza was warm, but not hot enough to give you that little blister on the roof of your mouth. I didn't eat the last two slices because they were cold after I'd eaten the first four. My wife's salad was fine, although she remarked that there were a lot of greens and not as much \"good stuff.\"  I don't know that I'd say to my wife, \"Hey, let's drive downtown and mess around with parking and go to the Strand,\" but as a casual place within walking distance of Symphony Hall it was fine. We'd probably go back.",
