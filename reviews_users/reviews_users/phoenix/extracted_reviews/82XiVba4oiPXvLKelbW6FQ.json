I feel as if the main course was mediocre and way overpriced, my husband and I shared the filet and mash potatoes, it wasn't anything special. As for the drinks, I started off with the bucking(something) but had to send it back because it was way to strong so I decided to go with wine, which was great. My husband went with their signature manhattan and he said it was wonderful. We had the hot stone waygu for an appetizer and it was amazing. Overall I think the place was over priced...but would go back for drinks because it has a nice atmosphere.",

They gave us dessert just cuz we had recently gotten married. Just to be nice. Our server Tina was a real gem-recommended a fantastic wine. The manager Donovan made a point to speak with us and even helped bring us our dinner. James was working with a Ayer, bread etc and was really helpful. We are bringing our family from out of town in here in a couple of weeks. This place has got two new patrons for life.",

Our waiter started picking up more tables, we started refilling our own water and watched him bring drinks to other tables. We kept waiting and watched him take other orders and then we waited some more. I'm not sure how long it actually was because I stopped checking my watch after 40 mins. Then he comes by and was like \"have we decided\" as if he gave us an hour because we didn't know what we wanted. No sorry. I ordered my steak medium rare and it came back cold in the middle. They took it back to reheat it came back with my cold sides on it. So much for warm food. Then began the process of waiting for the check. Here's the kicker...the started turning off the lights like they wanted to go home but we would have left way earlier if we had gotten any type of service. Really disappointing.",

They had a NYE prefix menu for $110 per person, but we chose to order off the menu. We had a good night and enjoyed the food/dinner. Bourbon & Bones was a good choice for what we wanted, and it delivered good food. But there is no doubt, the noise level is high, so be prepared.  Drinks, well made and enjoyed. Nice wine list, and my 1000 Stories Zinfandel went well with my steak. Food, was very good, cooked perfectly and flavorful. We had the filet & NY strip, then sides of mac&cheese and creamed spinach. Both sides also very good; actually the M&C was fantastic.Then we had dessert to finish the evening. All of our food was served hot and cooked perfectly.  Service, was average, and acceptable. Ashley had a pleasant attitude and was friendly. We did appreciate that the manager was visible, moving about the dining room, checking on tables.  We appreciated what was offered, and felt Bourbon & Bones lived up to our expectations. Would revisit and recommend to others.",

    "text": "I took my cousin out for his birthday to Bourbon & Bones. We both have been here before. My cousin always wears a backwards cap pretty much everywhere he goes. His son always wears a tank top. Both have been to this establishment in this attire. We arrive at 7pm, to which the hostess looks him in the eye and says \"are next availability is not until 8:45pm, feel free to wait at our bar\". So we decided to put our name in, and go next door to kill some time. 8:45 rolls around and we head back to B&B. We see the same hostess, who then says, \"sorry sir but you will have to remove your hat\". To which he replied, \"I was just here and you said nothing about a dress code\", and as a matter of fact you offered us a place at the bar\". \"Furthermore I have been here before in this attire and no one said anything\". We spoke to the manager, to which that was a waste of time. Here is the issue. The issue is not that this establishment has a silly dress code (as if they are Cafe Monarch) the issue is that they let us wait for AN HOUR AND 45 MINUTES instead of telling us up front that he will have to remove his hat upon arrival. Then instead of taking responsibility for their mishap, they double down. We ended up walking out, because at this point it's about principle, and not the hat. We didn't get to eat until 9:30pm. Thanks Bourbon & Bones. Maybe you should actually hire professionals, instead of acting like you are!",

    "text": "When I first saw this spot that recently opened I was pretty excited and looked it up on Yelp, of course. After reading the reviews and looking at the menu, I wasn't super impressed and wasn't planning to come here. One of my friends booked his bday dinner here so I decided to come with an open mind and give it a real shot.  Nice ambiance and decor especially since we had a group of 8 and were able to reserve the back, private room for our dinner. Service was just ok. Waitress was sweet and had a great attitude but she repeatedly forgot things. I had to ask at least twice for each little thing I wanted (salt and pepper, lemons, etc.). She also completely mixed up our bills. I will say she knew the menu inside and out but maybe writing things down might have helped her remember everything.   In terms of food, they ran out of scallops which was a big bummer so I had to create my own seafood platter out of the appetizer sampler. All of those options are served cold so it just wasn't as great as I had wished. My husband did not care for his lamb chops at all. The flavor wasn't great. Also, prices are HIGH -- especially for what you get. Everything and I mean everything is a la carte, including sauces and sides. The sides were family style and they were a pretty good size, but again, the taste just wasn't amazing to me -- and I tried several different ones.  Nice place in terms of decor but I don't feel inclined to return. Service and food flavors could be better and for that price point, there are just so many other amazing, better options in the area.",

He did a fantastic job it was delicious! We ordered a 10 ounce filet asparagus wild mushrooms which were all fantastic everything was cooked to perfection.  Let's not forget we ordered the grilled octopus appetizer.  It was definitely one of my favorite octopus dishes I have ever had.  I didn't want to share it lol.

He made us feel at home and made us a couple of bourbon drinks. We ordered food and he even made a couple of suggestions which made us rethink our choices but we loved the food. The food came out fresh and without any issues. We had a couple of filet minons with chimichurri sauce - I have never had a better chimichurri sauce. We had a side of the sauteed spinach and the white truffle mashed potatoes which added to the flavor of the steak. We ended the meal with a creme brulee and some coffee. I loved the whole meal.

We had a reservation but because of the popularity of the place our table wasn't quite ready. No worries, we found seats for two at the bar. That's where we met Justin, a hard working, quick to pour bartender extraordinaire! We enjoyed his service so much that we opted to just sit and dine at the bar.  Then it happened, I spotted foie gras as a side/topping to your dish and the hubs asked Justin if we could get the foie as an appetizer .... \" let me check\" ....  out comes this delicious bruschetta topped with an Apple crisp compote, sprinkled with blue cheese and the foie gras adorned atop all the goodness!  Justin smiled. We smiled. A bromance began between the two and I was just elated to witness such joy!  Because we had such an amazing start with HH over at a sushi restaurant we decided to share a dish because we were pretty full. We ordered the bone in ribeye a 24oz monster of a steak and a side of beets with goat cheese. The steak was A-Ok for me it arrived warm and by the time we cut to the middle it was cold as if the steak was cooked and sat. Then plated and left in the expo window. We didn't send it back but the gentleman next to us sent his back experiencing the same problem. The beets were good we love beets but they were a bit on the heavy salted side. We might go with the asparagus next time.  All in all, we dined for a few hours which is always a sign that we are enjoying ourselves, the company and the surroundings.  A 4 star \" better than most Chop house\" adventure.",

Started with steak tartar and hot rock beef and then we all ordered steaks and shared sides. Everyone enjoyed their meal, so we finished by splitting the butter cake, which was a good call. Ambience was cool. Picking your steak knife was unique and a nice touch. I will be back.",

We were greeted graciously at the door by several host eager to make you feel welcome. We were sat at a booth by a window which is nice because we love to people watch (Old town is definitely the place for that). We were poured water and greeted by our smiling, enthusiastic server Christopher. Although being a new restaurant he was very knowledgeable and walked us through the menu offering exceptional options and suggestions. I started off with the Fizzing Flowers and my boyfriend got the Manhattan up. Both rolled into appetizers where I got the steak tartare and he got the beef carpaccio. Both were delicious but I absolutely loved the tartare (can't stop thinking about it actually). They have this great knife presentation as well, a wooden box with a selection of different knives to chose, it was a great touch. I got the lamb for an entree and he got the bone in ribeye, paired with a ZD Cabernet. Both were great but I think I will get the ribeye next time, it was just about the best steak I've ever had!!! We ended the night with the Mason jar banana split and butter cake, just wow. It's hard to believe this place just opened and how on point everything was from the food and the service by Christopher. Pretty sure I'll be back next week!",

I ordered the ribs with duck fat fries. Ribs were far from fall off the bone and fries were just average. So disappointing. Probably never have had to chew so hard on ribs, and I've eaten a lot of ribs. Sauce was good but come on. Your name is bourbon and bones, cook your ribs longer. My husband got the veal chop and Brussels sprouts. Not tender or juicy. Another over priced scottsdale restaurant that does not deliver. Giving it three stars because of the ambiance, service and cocktails. If rating based on food it would've been two.",

We didn't have reservations and it was packed when we arrived but the manager kindly found a couple who were cashing out at the bar so we could snag those seats (full menu is available at the bar).  We were doing wine that night - I had a wine on tap that was a very reasonable $9/glass.  I had the scallops for dinner which were served with fresh shaved asparagus.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and so decadent.  My friend had the petit filet and brussels sprouts (which were giant).  We had the pecan cake with cinnamon ice cream for dessert...which was incredible. The service couldn't have been better - bartenders and managers both checked in on us to ensure our evening was going well and seemed to genuinely care what the answer was.  They really have it dialed in here.  Will be returning for sure.",

Since I'm a gentleman, I said that I had a tab open and would like to close it out since it's unfair to the bartender not to get a tip. Manager says you're gone and I'll take care of it.

We ordered mashed potatoes, asparagus, and homemade mac & cheese as the sides to share. My filet cut like butter and melted in my mouth -probably the best filet I've ever had! Of course they have a giant bourbon list and also the most impressive wine list I have ever seen! We enjoyed a wonderful creme Brulee and a \"doughnut\" which was basically monkey bread with chocolate chips and candied pecans in it - amazing! Beyond the amazing food is the service. We were greeted by a very nice hostess and brought to our table. There were at least two people besides our server that waited on us all night including wiping down our tables between courses. When they brought the sides for our steaks they actually served them on our plates for us. You really feel like you are being waited on at this place. At this price point I would expect that though! I had also noted on my reservation that it was my daughter's birthday so they kindly put a candle in her dessert. All in all a five-star experience!",

    "text": "Verdict: Decent food but be prepared to spend some serious bones.  If you're not into bourbon, there's an extensive wine list and some beers as well. If you're not into bones, you can opt out of those too. Even a vegetarian has options, though not a ton. It is a steakhouse after all.   They know what they're doing with a filet mignon. No doubt about that. Their appetizers were well made too, from the oysters, to the octopus, and so on. Got their French Onion Soup. While it wasn't the best I've ever had, it's attractive and has plenty of flavor. There's the right amount of cheese, bread, and soup for a good balance.  The Caesar salad has an interesting crouton-like ring around it, acting as a sort of bowl that houses the lettuce. You have to give points for being clever. I don't mean the ring for the salad so much as finding a way to price it above $10 where it probably costs about a buck or two for the ingredients, haha.  The one disappointing dish out of them all was the salmon. The cuts were thick and the cook time was only enough to put a light sear on one side. The meat melted in your mouth, which sounds great. The problem is, it had virtually no flavor on the entirely portions and that was most of the meat.  If you're getting desert here, go for the apple crumble. It's great. Otherwise, head across the street and enjoy some gelato.",

    "text": "I went there for happy hour with a friend.   We were celebrating our birthdays and he said I could pick the place.   Since I had never been to B&B, I thought we should check it out.     We sat at the bar since all of the tables were taken.   The bartender was friendly, Rafael, very competent, and made a great drink, which I guess one can't really miss up Grey Goose shaken with ice up, which is billed as the classic martini.   It was one of the HH drink items.   I told him to skip the green olives -- any variation of it --- but to substitute it with the dark cherries used in manhattans.   My friend ordered the SUB ZERO WHISKEY N COKE.   He said it tasted just like a slushy.    I tasted it.   He was right.    I guess that would be an alcoholic slushy.  Rafael gave us two thick cut, very crispy pieces of bacon.   YUMMM!   I don't know 'bout you, but I LOVE thick cut crispy bacon.   We quickly devoured it.  For food we had the fried calamari and the THE DEVILS CUT, HOT ROCK WAGYU BEEF from the HH menu.   What a concept.   I hot rock was placed in front of us.   The beef is raw.   One puts the beef on the hot rock to cook, dip it in one of the two dips provided and pop in one's mouth.   YUMMMM!    The calamari was good as well but nothing compared to the beef.  I would definitely return.   I like the place.  I am giving it four stars instead of five ONLY because I think it needs more options as far as the food and drinks for HH.   I am not a fan of bread, therefore, the sliders and burger were not something I'd order.   And I can't really get excited over a cheese board.   That is so ho hum. ...",

I have never faced such behavior leaning towards BIGOTRY from anyone or place that I've entered  before.  Upon entering my partner and I were greeted as such, \"yes, how may we help you!\"  We said \"table for two, please just for drinks\". (It was 112 degrees out and we had been walking )  Their reply, \"I'm sorry we have nothing available\"  We went on to show them that the restaurant was exceedingly EMPTY except for the bar area which was occupied.  We even asked for a table top seating in the bar area and was told, \"those are reserved\"  When asked what time it was about 1 hour away for supposed reservation of the tables marked reserved.  All we desired were cold beverages. They stared at us pointedly that we go elsewhere as they won't be able to serve us.  I have never in 44 years been treated that way; I didn't even know such behavior still occurred.  WoW!!",

It was amazing. I order all my ribeyes medium rare and it was cooked perfectly! My wife and I ordered three sauces. I highly recommend the Chimichurri sauce. Our waitress Tina was amazing. She recommended the sauce and it added a whole new flavor to the steak. Amazing! Must try IMO.  My wife's bone in filet was tender and perfectly cooked as well. We also ordered the chocolate decadence desert. It was good. The passion fruit coulis threw me off at first but it ended up making the dish very flavorful. Overall I enjoyed it. Top 10 steak houses in Phx area IMO",

If the blocks come out black, even though they are hot, the beef does not pick up the salt while it cooks. So I wouldn't order this appetizer, you will be disappointed.

They even had the option of an ice ball in their cocktails. Although this restaurant is more upscale, the food is worth the price! The sides and appetizers were so unique than just your average steakhouse with subtle twists that really made the meal. The service was attentive and prompt. Plates were cleared in a timely manner and the servers really seemed to enjoy their work. The icing on the cake was each individual was given a case of elegant steak knives to choose from for their meal! I was wowed!",

The scallops were the best I've ever had at a restaurant...seared on the outside and silky on the inside. Cooked just as I like them. The brussels sprouts were amazing - made with bacon and a maple bourbon glaze. The truffle fries were yummy. I'd skip the corn as a side, as it was expensive and nothing was done to make it special. The dessert was coconut fried ice cream and bourbon pound cake a la mode. The three of us shared it to finish our wonderful meal. It was expensive, but definitely a good choice for a special night out. Our server, Geoff, was extremely attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable.",

Tina was very knowledgeable and helpful with guiding us through the VERY extensive whiskey/boubon and wine list. (So many choices!) The ribeye was to die for! So tender and juicy! We tried the house steak sauce and the chimichurri. They were both delicious! I highly recommend the brussel sprouts, truffled mashed potatoes, and truffle mushrooms! The banter we had with Tina throughout the meal was awesome! It's great to find a steakhouse that isn't snobby and pretentious. The atmosphere was trendy, welcoming, and \"casual\". Money well spent!

We seated ourselves at the end of the bar on the comfy leather bar chairs and ordered the house Manhattan.  Probably the best Manhattan I have had so far!  Dry and smooth!  We didn't order big for the entrees and opted for a melange of appetizers instead.  - wedge salad - crisp and fresh lettuce that paired well with the dressing and crispy bacon - meatballs - tender, juicy and the mushrooms were tasty - wagyu beef slices - sizzle your own thinly sliced wagyu with a drizzle of sea salt.  The meat just melts in your mouth - pork belly with quail egg - absolutely Devine!  Tender pieces of pork belly piled high with maple drizzle and a fried quail egg on top.  Did I mention that there was bar bacon???  Our bartender was super personable and made our eating and drinking experience superb!",

    "text": "Man, seriously... not again. This pains me to update my review again for basically food that was hardly edible and horrendous service at Bourbon & Bones.   So, lets rewind here for a second and get the facts straight. I first dined here a few months back when they first opened. Anything that could go wrong, did... and I still ended up shelling out over $100.00 for that disaster (that was even after they took off several just horrible items). I was invited back by their GM Nick (who was great) to have a re-do of my evening, and the food was so much better that time around that I felt comfortable recommending it to friends who were visiting from out of town.  So off we all went and yet again,and it was like a repeat of my initial visit... We waited nearly 30 minutes past our scheduled reservation time with ZERO communication from the hostesses, the food was inedible... Think shells in the oysters, the shrimp cocktail lacked any flavor and the shrimp was overcooked to the point that we couldn't eat them, the pork belly was so overcooked that it they should just change the name to beef jerky and eggs  (where was that juicy pork belly). All of our steaks (but one but that's not saying much since they eat it basically burnt) were overcooked and under seasoned. The sides weren't anything to write home about, they got cold 5 minutes after being set down on the table. The whole pick your own steak knife still confuses me since it serves zero purpose.   I will give them the sexy vibe and a great location... but I am starting to think this restaurant concept group should either stick with cheese burgers and beer or get a chef in the kitchen that knows how to cook.   Yet again, I walked away from the place feeling embarrassed that I recommended this place to close family friends who forked over nearly $600.00 for dinner, and left still hungry (We stopped for pizza on the way home). Go anywhere but here... seriously anywhere.",

We ordered a ribeye and New York strip..they were seasoned and cooked just right but way to big for one serving. Along with the steaks we had the brussels sprouts and cauliflower and they were delish! Finished the night with an espresso martini that was a tad bit heavy on the cream.

The Hostess staff were surprisingly rude at such a high end restaurant. I started too tell them I was meeting co workers who I thought were there and received dirty looks and attitude. Upon realizing I was the first in my group to arrive, I went back and told them we would like to get a round of drinks from the bar until everyone was there and our table was ready. One girl responds \"There are no seats at the bar\"  So I ask \"where would you recommend I get a drink?\"  Response from hostess \"IDK squeeze in somewhere I guess\"  Two of my co workers arrived and come up to me saying \"is it me or do they seem kind of rude here?\"  I said \"yes very\"  Then they suggested we go somewhere else that would take our business. I called up Mastro's City Hall who obviously was more then accommodating to take us last minute and hold a cocktail table for us to have a drink at.   I've been to Mastro's over a dozen times and can say that I should have scheduled the event there from the start.   Being that Bourbon and Bones is a newer steakhouse in the area, I wanted to give them a shot. BIG MISTAKE!!!  I spoke with the manager Frank before leaving and told him my story... all he had to say was \"Sorry, I hope you will give us another try\"  I doubt that will ever happen, additionally I have shared this story with friends, colleagues, and family who all enjoy fine dining. I will continue to do so.   Don't waste your time or money. Go to Mastro's where they know what they are doing!  \"Disappointed\" is an understatement.",

We  were loving the tuna tartare appetizer, but was immediately disappointed when my husbands supposed to be mid rare steak came out mid well.  For a man(my husband) who cooks steaks to proper temp all day long at a high end resort, we were disappointed to come to a specialty steakhouse, pay a hefty price for a steak, and have it not  be to temp.   The waiter was great- came over and agreed that my husbands steak was overcooked and told us a new one would be out shortly.  What turned the evening sour, was when the \"manager\" came over and asked to see my husbands steak. We showed the manager without hesitation the steak, and the manger replies \"well it looks pretty rare to me, you sure you want to have one re-cooked more rare?\"  Being in the culinary industry for more than 8 years, it shocked my husband that he was getting a little push back on sending his food back from the manager rather than a apology, not to mention, once the new properly cooked steak arrived at our table, the manager never came back to us to ask how everything was.  In the end, the food was a little over priced for what you got quality wise(in our opinion). Not sure if we will return.",

He had been there previously and got a filet and lobster.  Unfortunately on his last visit he had a problem with the lobster and returned it to the kitchen, then the manager apologized and said he would take it off the bill but never did. It took so long to get the waiter back over, he just paid and left. So it took some convincing to get him back in there.  Sadly, the service was extremely slow (but it was courteous). We ordered a couple of steaks and some apps and it seemed like forever before they got to our table.  Bread bowl was pretty good, pretzel was a little dry.  Steaks were over cooked, and I'm not a penny pincher, but if your going to be in the high end steak business you should know the difference between medium and well done (not pink at all throughout). They were bricks. They were also Luke warm which makes me think they sat under heat lamps for a bit.  The bacon wrapped dates were off too. Half were burnt and the other half was ok. So I ate half of the apps and only the middle part of my ribeye steak. My buddy just sat and gloated... he didn't eat.  I didn't complain because it took so long for the waiter to come by all I wanted to do was leave because I was still hungry.  My buddy laughed at me and we went to Bottled Blonde for a pizza... which was really good by the way.  Atmosphere is pretty but very loud in the dining room. Great concept, poor execution. Time will tell... I will try it again on a slower night.",

My medium rare fillet came out cold in the center and I had to send it back for a little more heat. It came back much too overdone but I didn't want to be a pain so I kept it. Aside from the temperature dilemma the steak was slightly over seasoned. The side dishes were ok, ordered the duck fat fries, creamed spinach and mac and cheese. Going to many higher end Steakhouse's the managers usually come out to discuss when there are dishes sent back. At this establishment I don't know if there was a manager working as we didn't see anyone. Overall this location bills itself as a high end steakhouse and definitely charges like one but this visit barely beats out chain restaurants.",

The decor is modern and unique in its own terms, compared to the likes of Morton's, Mastro's, etc. You feel energetic yet relaxed. Perfect for business or leisure. On a Tuesday night, I am surprised by how busy it got. Service: Our server was also serving a table of 10+ people next to us, so there were a few times that we were waiting on her and couldn't flag her down. They also made a minor mistake on our order but generously made up for it: one of my colleagues ordered a 9oz steak, plain while another ordered a 6oz dressed. They mixed up the steak sizes and made up for it by giving an extra 6oz steak, which none of us could finish so it was a meal for tomorrow. Food: the table side bread was delicious, great with my bourbon. My starter salad is acceptable, nothing to rave about. My colleagues had the French onion soup that they were flabbergasted with how delicious it was. I had the scallops which came with sauteed asparagus: I'd give it a 7.5 our of 10, good but not memorable. Other orders on the table included the salmon and ahi, which had no complaints. The macaroni side was delicious. The truffle fries were \"meh\". The baked potato was indeed loaded and extra buttery! All in all, I wish Yelp allowed 1/2 stars as I'd give this place 4.5!",

They have 250 bourbons, whiskeys and scotches to choose from, and there are plenty of choices on the menu to satisfy any pallet.  My husband had steak and I had the salmon, each cooked to perfection. If you are gluten free, they go out of their way to make any modification to your meal. The atmosphere is warm and contemporary. I'd recommend sitting at the high top tables on the bar side of the restaurant. They overlook Scottsdale road and if you like to people watch... it's the perfect spot. Go early if you don't have a reservation, the place fills up fast.",

    "text": "An honest review start to finish. Little too loud. Bar overflows into seated dinning experience. Staff slightly unsure of things. Main dish awesome. Slightly over priced.  Liquor list needs some creativity. Main dish is worth mentioning twice-great!    Our waitress was very nice but clearly new to the customer service scene. Just seemed a little uncertain.  Busboys clear everything from the table when ever they go by, causing us to have to ask for utensils   Three separate times. Very polite and nice staff.   Oysters appetizer came shucked but not cut from the shell and rolled. Causing me to have to cut the muscle, roll them and then sip. I'm not a prude but this is oyster presentation 101 and they failed. Their oysters hold a new record for me as the smallest I have ever had. They were tasty tho.   Main meal was outstanding in presentation and flavor. Wow, fantastic. I had the bacon and eggs, great! Small to medium sized portions, which I sort of liked but slightly costly for portion, but not outrageous. Fantastic flavor.   We had cocktails and they were nice and to be expected. The cocktail list was basic especially for a place with bourbon in their name.  We suggested add a bourbon or whiskey flight to the menu.. Our waitress seemed confused when we asked if they had a bourbon sampling flight.  Odd.    The place is really nice inside but loud. The bar over flows into the dinning area and distracts from the ambiance.   Over all it has the, \"this place is clearly new and learning what they are doing with a great chef\" feel about it.  I wish them well, glad I tried it, but don't think I'll be back until the luster wears down and they figure out what they are doing.",

The setting was modern and chic, the service was top notch and everything we had was delicious. For an appetizer we started with the carpacio. Then, our kiddos shared the chicken, while we shared the 32oz rib eye. We had the au gratin potatoes, brussel sprouts and risotto for sides. Then for desserts, we had the butter cake and bread pudding. It was truly a special evening and exactly what we were hoping for. We'll definitely be back!",

The music is what we like..piano/lounge music ... not overwhelming and added to the ambiance. The interior has a classy and cozy atmosphere with an attractive bar area. I love the seating area with an open view like you are dining outside.  The drink came with olives stuffed with blue cheese, love it, hard to find but few expensive, great restaurant have it.  Some of the food we ordered were Beef Carpaccio, Grilled Octopus, Bacon & Eggs, Lobster Tail Cocktail.  They were flavorful and beautifully presented. The menu were pricey but worth it.

    "text": "So my son wanted to try B&B cause a co-worker recommended this place. I bookmarked it cause I'm always game for a good steakhouse. I made reservations on Open Table which made it really convenient.   This place is downtown Scottsdale and I really am hesitant coming here cause of parking but to my surprise there is a public parking structure right behind B&B. Also, they have complementary valet parking too.   Walking in the place it's dimly lit with a modern decor. They have both a bar area and dining area. Not huge but would say medium sized but a really nice ambience to the place.   I basically messed up on my reservation and made it for four but we had five. They were very kind and went out of their way to seat us in their dinning area which I thought was nice of them when I basically screwed up.   We started out with their complementary bread basket. Wow. Pretzel bread and rolls. Really good but my favorite was there pretzel bread. Outstanding. We also ordered the crispy calamari. We always have to try calamari wherever we go. The calamari was really good. Breaded lightly. Cooked perfectly and not to chewy. Really liked the dipping sauce too. So the appetizer was very good.   I ordered the 26oz Bone-In Ribeye. It was cooked perfectly. Very moist. Very tasty. Enjoyed it but it seemed like it had a lot more fat on the steak than other steakhouses. I mean cutting off the fat is no problem but just saying. My wife got the petite filet mignon. I had a few bites and it was very good. Very tender and delicious. Most importantly, my wife enjoyed it too.   As with most steakhouses, you have to order your sides separate. We ordered the Brussel Sprouts, hash Browns, and Mushrooms. When our order came out, they brought out mashed potatoes instead of mushrooms. They also serve your sides for you. So we had three people dishing out our sides. When the manger came by to ask how's it going someone mentioned that we ordered mushrooms and not mashed potatoes. They got on it right away and brought out our mushrooms. No fuss. No arguments but service. It's also great that they didn't charge us for their mistake too. I thought all the sides were very good but really liked the Brussel Sprouts the most.   So we were all so full but just ordered the dessert Warm Apple Crumble. It was pretty big. Really good. Just enough to satisfy the sweet tooth. Just loved the warm apples inside.   So the service was really good. Right when we sat down our server greeted us and asked us for our drinks. The service seemed a little slow at times but I guess they allow their guest to enjoy and have a relaxing meal. I would say our server was fairly friendly and took care of our table. Always filling our water cups. The cool thing about this place is when you order a steak, they bring out a wooden box and allow you to pick out your steak knife. They have big thick manly knives to more smaller knives for the women. You get to chose your own.   We did like the ambiance. Dimly lit with a few blue light and everything seems so open with the ability so see outside with all the people walking by and the cars going by. It's just so scottsdale. Enjoyed it  Like I said, I enjoyed the meal.  Really good service. Very good steaks. Food is excellent. Great ambiance. Really did enjoy. There are so many great steakhouse it's just your preference. Enjoy. We did",

They also make a round ice ball for $3 more and $1 goes to cancer research. You must ask for this though because they don't try to up sell. After Bourbon I tried a Kentucky Cooler because I make this all the time at home and I'm from Kentucky. This was a huge disappointment in flavor but a good try. The music is not very pleasing. It seems like it's geared towards people under 25. Then we were seated for dinner after asking twice. We did have a reservation and thought they would get us at the bar since they mentioned that at check in.  Service in every other aspect was amazing! Every bite of our appetizers, soups, salads, steaks, sauces and sides were amazing. The bone in rib eye had a caramelized crust that was outstanding. Another stand out was the atomic horseradish you could add to the shrimp cocktail. We split a piece of key lime cheesecake for dessert and it basically tasted like scrambled eggs with no flavor. We didn't try any other desserts but maybe steer away from them based on our experience. Overall very good but needs a few improvements.",

    "text": "Amazing service with a casual feel, great patio and valet! However, the food was extremely disappointing. We had the salmon and filet and both were extremely too salty. I had the spinach option as a side and it was just as salty. Katia our server, who was very nice, asked how the dinner was and this was prior to completion. I did mention to her how salty the dinner was. She apologized and I expected to hear from the manager, but there was no follow up. That was the end of it and it took me by surprise. I would like to say that possibly it was a mishap, but both entrees were heavily salted. And just a side note, we tend to salt our food usually, but we couldn't add any salt to these entrees. It affected our enjoyment for the food.   Now again, we did love the service from the staff collectively and I would recommend. Something just went terribly wrong food wise for us.   If you love bourbon and whiskey, this is your place! If you love the dark wood and leather feel, this is your place! It's a great location on Scottsdale Rd with an open patio/bar area and plenty of people watching and this time of year the weather is unbeatable!!",

    "text": "Some restaurants are just better than others and you know it as soon as you walk in; BOURBON & BONES is one of those restaurants.  Everything about this restaurant is 5 STARS.  BOURBON & BONES  Carefully selected cuts of aged beef and a sizable bourbon list are highlights at this downtown Scottsdale chophouse, also serving up seafood, global wines and craft cocktails inside a contemporary, industrial-chic dining room with hand-forged metal details and reclaimed wood.   THE STORY   I had a business meeting and my colleague picked Bourbon & Bones.  \"Great!\" I said. I had been looking forward to trying this restaurant.  When I walked in, I just KNEW I was in the right place. The manager was at the host desk and welcomed me in: It felt like a good friend was having me over for dinner.  I found my colleague, and the manager found us a lovely booth by the window overlooking Old Town Scottsdale. We asked him about the history of the decor, which was impossibly gorgeous. What a great and very charming guy.  I had the west coast oysters and the crab cakes. All of our food was OUTSTANDING. Bourbon & Bones has the kind of menu that you can't fully appreciate in just one visit.  (I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the delicious bacon that is offered as a bar snack. Such an adorable touch.)  CONCLUSION  I absolutely LOVE this restaurant! TREMENDOUS ambiance, food, and service! What a fantastic find! I can't wait to go back to Bourbon & Bones!  5/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Available for special events.  *Parking wasn't evident: It's Old Town Scottsdale.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbourbonandbonesaz.com&s=4d787331dfc49d6e3bdf3a3f4d07dac31b5c1dc7542ee70a4af4e2c18e97690e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bourbonandbonesaz.com</a>",

    "text": "NomNomz: 10/5 Cocktails: 5/5 Service: 10/5 Ambiance: Trendy, modern, upscale   Wow, just WOW! I've been dreaming about this place all week since I went there last weekend. This is perfect for a hot date or some best friends in town, showing them the great food scene in Scottsdale. I've heard about this place for a while, and have been waiting to check it out. It's pricey, but it's definitely worth it. They don't skimp out on proportions, so you definitely get your money's worth. The location is in the heart of Old Town, easily accessible for a night out after.  This place is a steak house ladies and gentlemen. And it's one to write home about. From the moment we got there, everyone was extremely nice/welcoming, and the service was impeccable. The bus boys were also at the table often, clearing away dishes and refilling waters. We also had a special delivery for our steak orders, with a lovely wooden box full of beautiful knives to choose from. Our waitress was amazing, and highly knowledgeable and I could tell that the entire staff were all on point.   Cocktails: Impressive. The list is extensive, and includes more than 120 bourbons and 320 whiskey offerings. My favorites are the Chophouse Martini ($18) or the Imperial Old Fashioned ($18). They have some other select house cocktails to choose from ranging from $14-$18, and a wide ranging wine list on top of that ($10-$30/glass). They have quite the elite wine bottle selection if celebrations are in order. Take your pick!   Nomz: If you're a seafood person, start with the oysters (1/2 dozen $18), and jumbo shrimp cocktail ($7) with your party - you will not regret. The Caesar ($12) and Wedge salad ($10) are two of the best I've ever had, so those are recommended as well (large portions , so definitely split before your main courses). There are other great items on the appetizer list ranging from $12-$24, so you'll be happy with whatever you order because everything is phenomenal.  Main Nomz: This is a steakhouse, so get ready to salivate over your dishes. All the steak is USDA Prime & certified Angus beef. My favorite was the 6oz Petit Filet Mignon ($39), and they have a 10oz for ($47). The New York Strip (14oz $49) is also incredible. Their steak menu ranges from $39-$95, and all can be accompanied with delicious house signature sauces ($4-$9), or \"Over The Top\" items such as \"Oscar Style\" ($16), blue cheese crust ($5), foie gras ($16), onions & mushrooms ($4), pork belly ($10), sauteed shrimp ($14), or main lobster tail ($MP). Oscar style is the most popular, and my favorite pick (come with lobster, ahem). They have other seafood dishes ranging from $33-$40, like grilled salmon or pan seared scallops, and a roasted chicken ($27) and braised pork shank dish ($31). They have a prime rib dinner available Sundays & Monday's, slow roasted with a twice baked potato ($36-$42). Their side signature options are also NOT to be ignored. Truffled Lobster Mac n Cheese ($25), and the Sherried Wild Mushrooms ($10) were our favorite, and the Grilled Asparagus and Roasted Broccoli ($10) were other great additions, as well. All side dishes range from $8-$24, and look amazing. Everything is probably great on the menu, the food quality is to perfection.   Desert: I'm not a huge banana fan, but their Banana Bread Pudding with ice cream and whiskey sauce is out of this world. They have a few other sweets to select from like Creme Brulee, or Key Lime Cheesecake (all $10) or just some ice cream scoops for $3. If you're a fan, they also have a decent sized menu for Desert Wine & Port or Brandy.   There is a $25k item on the menu that looks absolutely insane, but I'm curious how many times it's been ordered! It comes with Vintage Cristal (limited edition), a handcrafted 6 course meal with a dozen 32oz Dry-aged Tomahawk Ribeye Steaks, with limo transportation as well. Part of the proceeds go to one of Arizona's homeless shelters so some of it goes to good cause.   Tip: Definitely make a reservation online, the place is always packed. They also have happy hour, which I'll definitely be going back for (Monday through Friday 4-6pm).  Tip: During the holidays, if you book early enough you'll get a complimentary champagne toast.   Hours for easy reference: Sunday & Monday: 5pm-9pm Tuesday-Thursday: 5pm-10pm Friday-Sunday: 5pm-11pm Bar- Open daily until 4pm",

The must have is the duck fat fries tho and the homemade ketchup. The brussel sprouts were a little soggy and overly buttery but my guest enjoyed them, not me tho.

The menu is incredibly appealing,  as well as the cool and inviting decor; but for the prices, the place is way too loud and crowded.  The servers are bumping into tables trying to serve guests and guest have to squeeze by other diners to walk either to your table or to the restrooms.  This would all be acceptable if the price point was lower.....but for fine dining prices (as well as an EPIC Cristal dinner listed for 35,000..seriously) you want more comfort and peace of mind.  We were a group of 10 that sat in the private dining room and we could not hear each other while talking to each other.....even if you yelled to each other it was hard to hear.  The private dining room table was ridiculously large, so sharing side dishes was a process of sliding( really sling-shotting) the plates across the granite table top. Lastly, the portions (again for the price) were too small and skippy.  The side dishes should give you the appearance of value for price.  I think Bourbon and Bones has an identity crisis....they want to be a Maestros, City Hall, Dominicks etc but want to appeal to a hipper, downtown Scottsdale crowd.........they should either lower their prices or remove a few tables and work on their acoustics.",

I do have a few notes to warn - I would avoid the happy hour Sauvignon Blanc - I had to give it up and go back to my regular tipple. The Second thing I wanted to add is a note to the Management - STOP HOVERING OVER YOUR STAFF. I have worked in the industry before and I can say you have a winning theme but... (1) Your checking on how things are, (2) how the drinks are going, (3) how the turnaround time is aka your micromanagement is only going to make your staff nervous and detract from your goals  I had a good time - well done, its a cool place, great atmosphere, great food, drinks, service  Go here !",

    "text": "I wanted to celebrate my birthday at someplace new and just happened to see an ad for B&B in this month's issue of Phoenix magazine.  Scottsdale is a bit far for us to go for dinner but we saw they start serving dinner at 3:00 PM so we thought that would cut down the drive time...so off we went and are we ever glad we did.  Our dinner and dining experience was absolutely fantastic - thanks in large part to Chef J's presence at table side and his suggestions of scallops for my wife and veal chop for me.  We added hash browns and brussel sprouts, which were perfect compliments to our entrees.  My wife started with the tomato onion salad and I had the best iceberg wedge salad I've ever had with absolutely delicious blue cheese crumbles.  And for dessert, my wife had the butter cake and I had the apple crumble...both memorable and wonderful caps to one of the best meals we've ever had, anywhere.  It's quite unique to have an executive chef interact so personally with guests but a really nice touch, to be sure.  Despite the distance and drive time, we expect to be regulars at Bourbon & Bones...our new favorite restaurant!  Thank you, Chef J, for your great recommendations, super table-side manner, fabulous food and warm & friendly hospitality.  Bourbon & Bones is the kind of upscale restaurant where we want to spend our time and money.",

    "text": "Very modern and upscale place, the theme is suiting and it's certainly one of the nicer establishment around. Their Bacon & Eggs (pork belly, quail egg over a rosemary Johnny cake), Beet Tartare (diced beets over whipped goat cheese on fried walnut banana bread), Medjool Bleu Cheese Stuffed Dates and Devil's Cut Hot Rock Wagyu Beef are a must-have for starters! Probably my current favorite appetizers of any place at the moment. As for entree, I've had both the 10oz Filet, medium rare of course, and the Double Cut Dry Aged Pork Chop on separate occasions, and my only complaint is that the filet was not as flavorful as I expected, given the dry aging, but I would order it again either Oscar Style (Crab Claws, Bearnaise, Asparagus) or with the Bleu Cheese Granola, and the Pork Chop was a bit fatty for my liking, but otherwise tasty. Everything paired great with a Boulevardier (my drink of choice) and the nifty thing about it, is they allow you to \"choose your weapon\"; they have a small case full of steak knives, and you select which one you will be using, neat little idea.",

The service was phenomenal, we never once had to wait for water, a check in, etc. Our waitress Anna made excellent recommendations on their extensive (I mean extensive) bourbon and whiskey list. We were able to order a flight of bourbons we wanted to try (not on the menu but ask your server) and we tried the Manhattan, which had an amazing smoky flavor, as well as the Imperial Old Fashioned, which had just the right amount of sweetness. The bone in NY strip with the bleu cheese crust was AMAZING along with the truffled mashed potatoes. Yes. Truffled mashed potatoes. My bf had the pork chop which was outstanding as well! Oh and don't forget the bleu cheese stuffed, bacon wrapped dates we had as an appetizer. Be prepared to  spend a little more than your typical dinner, but the quality of food, drinks and service is completely worth it. Can't wait to go back!",

It was perfectly cooked: pink all the way through the middle, crispy outside layer that had a crunch to it, and it was juicy to a point where it melted in your mouth. They also bring out a box of knives for you to choose from to cut your steak which upped the experience for me. My only regret was not getting the tomahawk ribeye, it was just a little out of my price range. I may have to go back their again tonight.",

The manager offered us a free meatball appetizer just because our table wasn't cleaned well before we were seated. This was a very good indication that they care about service and their food. I ordered the New York bone in strip steak medium rare with mashed potatoes while my wife had the petite sirloin with fries.

After we ordered drinks, we were kindly asked by the manager if we didn't mind switching to half-circle booth overlooking our old table in exchange for their covering our first round of drinks...well, sure I suppose!  The new booth had basically a bright spotlight on my seat (weird...maybe they need to change out the bulb or redirect it since it was uncomfortable to be seated there...but hey, a free drink?).  Anyways, no one ever ended up sitting at the table we got bumped from..weird.  Regarding service, we never had to wait for drinks or water refills.  The bread basket was lovely (we liked it all EXCEPT the pretzel breads) and refilled upon request.  Entrees  I had the crab cakes as entree - decent but not spectacular. I finished but my bf only took a single bite and kept to his steak My bf had the filet since that's what I will take a few bites of, and we both enjoyed it - not a bite was left The other diner had the bison steak (recommended by the server as \"I mean, where else can you get a bison steak?\") and it was finished and reportedly good  We also got a dessert (gratis I believe) but it was so unremarkable I don't even remember.  Service was fine.  The only weird thing besides the musical tables we experienced was their \"choose a knife\" gimmick.  I asked incredulously, so...what knife should I get for crab cakes and the response was \"um I don't know\".  LOL, ok well neither do I, buddy!",

Presentation for all was good.  For dinner I ordered the Colorado lamb. Large lamb chops which was surprising. Others ordered ribeye and I believe NY strip. These cuts looked amazing.

This is not your basic eatery, and I'm thrilled to have something that isn't just a pricey old town restaurant with a cool vibe; they actually have really good food! P.S. I'm a huge fan of sitting in the bar to enjoy a more lively atmosphere and we sat in the bar area, but at a surrounding table. The chairs were divine. Like super comfortable bar chairs. Weird I know, but I thought I'd mention it bc I actually took time to admire the chairs.",

I kindly asked the maitre d' if there was anyway he could make something happen and low and behold, a table to seat all 5 of us was made available. We had a very knowledgeable and entertaining waitress, who treated us like gold. Everything was prepared properly, arrived promptly, and tasted amazing. The ambiance is upscale, but not snobby or unaccommodating in anyway. I would definitely return.",

Calamari (crispy and great aioli), Cheese Plate (very good, they just need to provide more crackers), Steak and Fries, & the coolest Hot Rock Wagu Beef.  The meat had amazing flavor in the steak and fries.  The Hot Rock Wagu meat is unreal! Then when you dunk it in butter and top with the salt they give its divine.  I will even say the teriyaki sauce they bring with it as well was very good, and I am not a big sauce on my meat kinda girl... Happy hour wines are delicious and nice pours!

I let the host know that it was my first time and my friend and I would only be having a drink. With no problem she sat us in the bar area right away.  Immediately we felt uncomfortable, because the server snatched the menus out of our hands when we let her know we were only having drinks. She was very rude and disrespectful. I watched her walk over to another staff member and he stared at our table until we left. If \"drinks only\" were going to be an issue, the host should have communicated that to us before seating us. I will NOT be recommending this place for its unwelcoming environment. I felt like we were being discriminated.",

Pros: Nice ambience and good location. Good service with smiles. My martini was good and do was my house salad.  Cons: My steak did nothing for me. I ordered the petite filet and the first time it came out burnt and well done. They tried again and this time, it was medium well but still burnt in several places. This steak wasn't nearly as flavorful as I thought it would be. It can't be as aged as they say. Since it's a steakhouse, I was sorely disappointed.  The best part was spending time with my friends.",

In addition, one ordered asparagus which was delicious and perfectly prepared and the other ordered a loaded baked potato which was also delicious and was bigger than a child's Nerf football.

The red wine glaze was a great accompaniment suggested by our server. - The Stuffed Medjool Dates - as described - The Meatballs - The Tuna Tartare - very tasty and beautiful presentation, loved the sesame sticky rice - Lobster Truffle Mac & Cheese - great! the perfect subtle essence of Truffle (nothing overpowering and a great complement to the seafood) - Brussels Sprouts - a dessert veg, for sure (bacon/maple/bourbon) - Loaded baked potato - as expected  Be sure to arrive earlier than your reso's to enjoy an ($18, ehemm) B&B Manhattan at the bar and some house-bacon in the Mason jar - a nice touch to start the evening off.",

This was extremely disappointing. The service was just ok. Was extremely excited about the meatballs. Who knew that meatballs are suppose to be charred on the outside and cold and uncooked in the middle. Took 10 mins to flag anyone down finally the som came by we were suppose to get another one. Never came! Steak came looked like something from the microwave. Still under cooked ordered medium rare. Sad the fact the meatballs had more char to it. For a steak house it needed to be more charred then that. Brussel sprouts were ok granted it was suppose to be the best thing on the menu. The bacon was not crispy at all. Loaded baked potato??? Ehh you can get a better one from Wendy's. Over all for spending 150 it was just ok.",

Complimentary bacon, fantastic, best food on the menu that's not on the menu! +$0  Octopus, presentation was a bunch of undercooked calamari pieces in a white bowl with onions that look the same, chewy, salty. -$22  Cauliflower, decent. It was a side, $8 yay for health.  Bourbon Pecan Buttercake, presentation, shit on a plate, the ice cream on top was fantastic. Pieces of pecan would've look better if individually placed one by one on the ice cream. $10.  Glass of Prisoner wine, $27. Very expensive glass but it was good!! Friendly female bartender offered another glass but I wanted to keep my thoughts to my self.   Last but not least, mixed, unorganized order but yeah stay along..  WAGYU New York Strip, - - - - - negative negative -$49 for 8 oz. okay seemed a little too good to be True, maybe I misunderstood what WAGYU is but I've never had bad WAGYU, this was a bad steak and worst WAGYU, I should've asked for the meats paperwork, it's name, origin and everything I felt like I got scammed! Can they legally call a steak wagyu if it's not wagyu, idfk but god awful.   Anyways this isn't directed towards the staff because it ain't your fault sweet child of mine. Maybe Chef, maybe chef received bad quality produce. Who knows.   I came here two years ago, thought it was trash, reconfirmed it's trash.  Please don't place a hit on me due to an honest review!",

And there was so much food we had to wait 2 hours to order our actual dinner.   I had the bone-in ribeye. Cousin had the 10oz filet. Both were amazing. I ordered mine medium rare with a little extra char outside. It was the most perfectly cooked steak I've ever had.   The attention to detail with the food and cocktails is incredible. Raphael, Ryan, and the bar staff were super friendly and on top of it 100%. I have absolutely nothing to complain about at all other than I forgot to photo my steak! From LA but we'll be back!

Sauce of kale and mushrooms was delicious but somewhat thick, so it took me a minute to notice it. Cauliflower and golden raisins were done before so not excited about these. Overall food was tasty.

The atmosphere is okay....going for that trendy, sparse look.  The tables are a little close; servers and customers are constantly trying to squeeze through spaces that barely exist. The noise volume is pretty high.  That, however, is the least of their worries.  The food just doesn't deliver for this price point.  The starters and salads were nice but the steaks simply had no flavor....decent cuts, cooked okay but there is nothing there flavor wise.  The sides are also nothing to write home about either.   Everything seemed to lack taste.  We had a good time but if I'm going to spend over $250 for my wife and I to go to dinner I want \"Amazing\", not average.  And if I'm entertaining clients I have to have a 'Wow' factor; unfortunately, there is no 'Wow' here.  (And, yes, the steak knife presentation is a cool touch but that shouldn't be the most interesting part of a meal.)  I'm glad we gave it a try but this is a one time only visit for us.",

I'm kind of a snob about restaurant bathrooms and felt like they were underwhelming (Only downside)  Otherwise everything was really good. Prices are what you'd expect for a Scottsdale Steakhouse so with any alcohol be prepared to drop a couple hundred dollars for dinner for two.   Steak was cooked to perfection. Fiancee has a 24oz T Bone and the flavor got better and better as you worked into the middle of the cut. Lobster mac and cheese was good but I think it was a little overpriced for what you get. Oysters were perfectly shucked. Special of the night was a braised short rib and the flavor and glaz on that were 100% amazing.   Our server was Bobby and he was awesome. I personally enjoy the service aspect of eating out as much as the food/ambience and he really delivered good service. Friendly, trendy, attentive but not over the top or in your face. He had superb product knowledge and you can tell that he is a True professional.   Overall 5 stars. Would take clients/friends here if they were in town.",

Jumbo shrimp cocktail was good, however, it does contain a lot of horseradish. So if you don't like that then stay away from this particular appetizer!   We split the bone-in rib-eye for $49 and it was amazing! Please note- the only reason why we split the steak was because I don't eat much.  This steak was flavorful and we still didn't finish it between the two of us!   We got sweet corn and mushrooms on the side, didn't finish all of them either, but I was very pleased with both dishes. Would order them both again.   We split everything and we did not leave hungry. Definitely will be back!",

It was weird that we had to ask for bread while we waited though....and from the GM who just happened to be walking by.  The Grilled Squid and Octopus appetizer was very good.  The Ceaser had a beautiful presentation and was delicious.   The steaks however were just okay.  I love bone in filet and order it anytime I can find it.  The steak's temperature was done exactly as requested; the meat was tender.   There was absolutely no flavor....which for $49 there should be some sort of flavor.  My husband had the Ribeye; it was good but not great....again lacked flavor.  And the brussel sprouts were inedible due to their lack of seasoning; they were just bitter.   None of the other sides looked very inspiring either.  I didn't try the dessert but I heard it was very good.  I won't be back.  I love a decadent experience and I don't feel you can get that at Bones and Bourbon.  And for their prices it should be decadent, not 'just okay.'",

    "text": "I was extremely excited to try this steak house. I went for my birthday this weekend, so needless to say my expectations were high.   Here's my initial interpretation; if you want to compete with Ruth's Chris, Steak 44; and Oceanclub, then you better tighten up the screws. Especially given what you are charging.   Service was nice. Our waiter was helpful, and attentive.   My $50 filet was extremely over cooked. So much that the manager came over and was shocked by the discrepancy: I asked for medium rare, and the inside was almost brown. To their credit, they were super nice about making me a new one, which turned out great. However, when the final bill came I was charged for 3 steaks...which they corrected.  After dinner they began setting up my table for dessert since it was my birthday. They made us a delicious peach pound cake. However, when the final bill came they charged me for my birthday dessert. Here's the thing; if I'm paying for my dessert I should get to see the dessert menu!!! If you are picking for me then the implication is you are paying for it. The waiter even said \"we got something for you\". At this point I was too tired to fight it, so I let it slide and paid for it.   Also, we ordered coffee with baileys. When it came we got 2 cups of coffee, and 2 glasses of baileys.... I wanted bailey in my coffee as it is usually prepared.   Conclusion. The little things mentioned above don't happen at the other steak houses. Which is why people feel comfortable spending that type of money.  Don't charge people for birthday desserts, don't over cook a $50 filet, don't screw up the receipt, and don't make people mix their own coffee/alcohol beverage.",

It was very flat, and had almost no flavor to it at all. We told the waitress we didn't care for it, and her response was dismissive. We sent one back, nearly full, and asked for an old fashioned to replace it.

    "text": "Disappointed in food and service at Bourbon & Bones. It's noisy and expensive -- not worth the price for a Saturday evening outing with friends (four couples total), when there are so many excellent restaurants in Scottsdale. Some things that stuck with us the next morning:  * Ordering a nice bourbon -- Angel's Envy -- resulted in this comment by the waiter: \"That's a starter bourbon. You should have this instead,\" he said, pointing to one costing nearly twice as much. Uh, no. (The Angel's Envy is listed as $16 on the menu, but came through as $19 on the bill.)  * We only knew that appetizers had been ordered when servings of Hot Rock Wagyu Beef arrived for half the table. Sitting on the other side of the table, we were never asked about appetizers -- which is a shame, because we had planned to try the Chop House Meatballs.   * My order of \"OVEN ROASTED 1/2 RED BIRD CHICKEN\" was more like the size of three Chicken McNuggets. Not even close to a half chicken. It was tasty, but frankly, I've had half-chicken dinners at Boston Market that were bigger and tastier.  * My wife's order of the 14oz veal chop was fatty and largely inedible. She mentioned this was the worst veal chop dinner she'd ever had. The waiter never came back to ask how things were -- at least not to our side of the table. He spent about 95% of his time chatting with the other side of the table.  * My bourbon was gone before the dinner came; I was never offered another beverage. But then again, the waiter wasn't interested in our side of the table, he was too busy laughing and pouring wine for the other side.  * This event celebrated one of our party's birthday. We didn't feel celebratory when it turned out that the house's surprise birthday dessert (I think it was a warm apple crumble) ended up on the bill! It was removed when we complained.  * On the positive side: the baked potato was excellent, as was the sauteed corn. My \"starter\" bourbon was tasty and satisfying. The wine ordered by one of the couples was not too marked-up: $42 for the bottle, compared to a retail of $20. One of our party was drinking soft drinks, and the waiter kept him \"filled.\" And they do a neat thing where they present each diner with a big box of different steak knives, and you get to choose your weapon -- we all enjoyed that.  Our dinner bill was $131. It was overpriced for what we were served, and how it was served.",

I'm glad I tried it out, it wasn't that I disliked it, but there are so many other places to dine at that I most likely won't be back.",

    "text": "I first came here after looking for a place to get a good steak in Scottsdale for a friends birthday. I have since come in a few times when I'm in town for various reasons. I have yet to be disappointed by the service or food. We usually order a few appetizers to share, steaks and a few drinks, switching things up each time to try something new. The appetizers are always creative and tasty. The steaks are always cooked on point. I'm pretty easy going when it comes to drinks but I do like to try different things and haven't been let down there either.  The service is always great, whether we are at the bar or a table. You gotta love being able to select your knife to use during dinner.  Yes, it is a bit pricey. No, its not your normal snooty, over priced restaurant. People talk, and enjoy themselves here. I guess if you're trying to have a good time, this is your place. If you want to eat in silence, while staring at your plate... Try some ear plugs... because its still worth it.",

    "text": "This place is so terrible I don't even know where to begin. Let's start at Bourbon... I'm from Kentucky, so I know my bourbon better than the average person, their selection is very weak and very overpriced, especially compared to other high end restaurants in the area. On top of that, if you want it severed on the rocks you have 2 options. Options #1 - Pay $5 for one large ice cube, yes that is correct $5 for frozen water. Option #2 - a cup full of crushed ice, full to the brim smh! The food is very subpar, for the price save yourself time and money and go to City Hall and have an actual good high end steak and high end bourbon. Service was crappy too, our server didn't know much.   Tourist stay away, this place is a terrible representation of what our great old town neighborhood has to offer.  Very excited to see what goes in next after this place goes out of business! Hope it's soon :)",

The side dishes were great. My fiance is a vegetarian and they made a special meal just for her, that was also amazing.

    "text": "We came here for my husband's birthday dinner and left fat and happy. Emphasis on \"fat.\"  We didn't have a reservation, but I figured since we were early-ish (about 6:20 on a Saturday) that we could give it a shot. We had no problem snagging a small booth by the window. The space is sleek and modern, and our server was very nice.  We split the truffled mushrooms (truffle gouda, holy crap right?) to start, and they were amazing. I opted for the half roasted (herby, juicy) chicken over mashed potatoes, and my husband went with the bone-in filet with a side of mac and cheese. His steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare. Before they were served, we got to select our own knives out of their little knife collection box. A fun touch.  The food was divine. Like I said, everything was cooked perfectly and the little crock of mac was deceiving--it was so rich and cheesy that we couldn't finish it off! Our server found out we were celebrating a birthday and presented us with a free order of their butter cake (GOOEY, molten cake with sauteed peaches, topped with candied pecans and a side of bacon-vanilla ice cream. OMG.) It was an amazing way to end the meal, but we honestly didn't NEED it. We were so, so stuffed. (But were we going to turn down free butter cake? NO WAY.)  There seemed to be a little too much time between ending our appetizer and receiving our main dishes, as well as getting our credit card picked up after we were done, but I know it takes a while for new places to get their bearings. Prices are pretty steep, but you're definitely paying for the location, the amazing food and the nice touches.  With my glass of wine, an appetizer, two mains and a side, we came out to $150 after tip. Definitely not a regular dining experience for us, but absolutely a place for celebrating and having a special night. It's Monday, and I'm still full!",

    "text": "Ugh. This place has such a great location and sexy vibe I hate to leave a somewhat negative review. We showed up to our reservation about 20 minutes early but they seated us right away which I really loved. Our server came by after ~8 minutes which I thought was a little long to be waiting. She was very friendly and provided great service throughout the meal so no other complaints there. I want to say her name was Ashley.   I ordered the East Coast Sour {Four Roses Bourbon | house sour | Cocchi Barolo Chinato | raspberry sorbet} and it was as delicious as it was beautiful! The key is to drink it from the side so you get the raspberry flavor in every sip. My friend got the Go Green {Hendricks Gin | cucumber | lemon juice | simple syrup | Fevertree bitter lemon soda} which was also excellent.   For appetizers we ordered 1/2 dozen west coast oysters served with daily house mignonette and cocktail sauce. I'm not sure exactly what type of oysters they were, but they were tiny and lacked flavor in my opinion. We also ordered the grilled squid and octopus, the octopus being dry but the seasoning was on point. For entrees we ordered twin lobster tails and the scallops. I didn't try the scallops but my friend said they were great. My lobster was chewy and didn't really have any flavor and didn't seem very fresh. The butter didn't even help! I also think they should offer to deshell it for you but maybe that's just me being snobby. I would definitely not order it again. We got a side of grilled mushrooms which were so overly seasoned and salty they were inedible. The mac & cheese on the other hand was the opposite-so bland with no flavor. The breadcrumbs on top were soft and not crunchy at all like it had been microwaved.   Like I said- the ambience and service in general were great, and the drinks were awesome. The food was just so forgettable and it ended up being a pricey 3 star meal.",

We commented immediately that we ordered a bottle.  He apologized and said he would be back with the bottle.  He came back and shared that it was his mistake, the two glasses were complimentary and gave us the bottle.  A few minutes late the Manager came by and picked up the 2 glasses that we had already had sips of and brought two new glasses...and they cracked the bottle.  All well and fine but definitely odd. 2) Tasting the bottle....they cracked the bottle and poured two tasters starting with the man and the myself.   3) After tasting, the bartender poured his glass of wine before mine (female).  Very strange. 4) Then screwed the cap BACK on the bottle instead of leaving the cap off and letting the bottle breathe. 5) Bartender was condescending and snippy.   All of this was incredibly surprising relative to what we anticipated for the meal and experience.  Appetizer: Octopus- Fair Meal: Bone in filet- excellent  Fernet Branca - very good  It will be more than a minute before we go back.

    "text": "Overall, we had a great meal here. We came in around 5:30pm on a Saturday and the place was pretty empty. I guess it picks up more around 7-8, which makes sense, but definitely would come back much later if we returned. Noted.   Upon arrival, there is complementary valet which is super convenient. There is also a parking garage behind the building as well. The valet guy was super friendly.   When we walked in it was a bit awkward... a bunch of the wait staff was just kind of standing by the hostess stand staring. I get it wasn't busy yet and clearly we came a bit too early but it was a weird initial vibe. The hostess seemed in a horrible mood too, so as we sat down we had a bad taste in our mouth and were worried it was going to be a disastrous meal.   Luckily, our waitress came over and immediately turned it around! She was friendly, went over the menu, had great recommendations and checked in just enough. Not too much but she was still around. The guys assisting with refills and clearing plates were attentive and friendly as well.   They have an extensive bourbon list (duh!) as well as a good wine selection and other various cocktails. I just went with a glass of wine since I'm not a huge bourbon drinker. It was good.   They bring you a bread basket with some pretzel bread and traditional white bread. We also started with the grilled octopus, which I really enjoyed. It had good flavor but wasn't overwhelming and was the perfect starter.   After clearing our appetizer, they brought over a box of steak knives and let you select which kind of knife you want. I thought it was a fun concept and a cool touch.   We both ordered the filet, I ordered the 6oz with a side of chimichurri sauce, and my girlfriend ordered the 10oz. We decided to split a side of Mac n cheese as well.   Both of our steaks were cooked as requested and were delicious. I got the chimichurri sauce at the recommendation of our waitress and it was amazing.. it has a bit of a kick to it but it wasn't too spicy. It was awesome. My girlfriend enjoyed her steak plain as well.   The Mac n cheese was more than enough to split between the two of us. It was super creamy and had a milder cheese flavor. I was a big fan. They even scooped out the first serving into our plates for us when they delivered the meal. Nice touch.   After the meal, we did peruse the dessert menu and there were some interesting selections but we were just too full.   The overall building is nice, the bathrooms were sparking clean, and I liked the ambiance. Comfortable seating, part industrial, part pub, it was modern and trendy.   In the end, the food was delicious, it was a bit pricey but it's steak in old town Scottsdale so it's to be expected. I'd recommend if you are looking for a nicer meal and in the area.",

Had oysters as an appetizer. Nice presentation and excellent horseradish.  Warm spinach salad was very tasty. Everyone in our party ordered steaks which were all good. I especially enjoyed my New York strip.  I very much enjoyed my evening here. I would definitely return.   Second visit-  this time the food was not so good. Three of the steaks that came out were barely room temperature.  Left extremely disappointed.  Obviously, this place does not have the consistency that I'm used to at steak 44 and Mastro's. Dropped my rating to a 3",

We were thirsty with anticipation considering the vibe on Saturday night    Started with the crab cake and grilled octopus  The crabcake was flavorless, thankfully it came with sauce on the side. The octopus was boiled, not grilled as indicated on the menu.   Fast forward to the main course, could wait to have a 90 day dry aged rib eye. Huge disappointment in flavor, no way was the steak aged 90 days. Although tender and delicious,  was not the flavor of an aged steak.   All in all it was a great place to hang and you're not a food critic this place may satisfy your pallet",

    "text": "On a recent business trip to Scottsdale, my colleague and decided to get a steak dinner and randomly picked Bourbon & Bones, we were very much not disappointed and I highly recommend this spot. No, that's not the end of the review, if you want more detail, read on.  So Bourbon & Bones has the cuisine of a classic (see: grumpy old man) steakhouse, but with none of the classic items. The ambience is great, good music, style and decor. The staff is super friendly and attentive, offering amazing recommendations and making great conversation. Our server, Jeff, was never far and always ran over to help. He had some great whiskey recommendations. Which leads me to another great feature of B&B: the whiskey selection. It's massive, well organized and filled with tons of good stuff. It's easy to do an international whiskey tour in one evening and not totally break your wallet with alcohol.  As for the food, the steaks were cooked perfectly and the sides were great. I highly recommend the brussel sprouts (just a hint of sweetness) and the truffle lobster mac & cheese. We started the meal with a classic wedge salad, which did not disappoint. We also ended with the chocolate mousse desert, which was fantastic, flavorful, great texture and consistency and finished with some raspberries. It was the perfect way to end the meal.  Any negatives? Only that you're going to want to get a reservation ahead of time. Fortunately, we didn't have to wait too long, and it was totally work it. Next time you are in the area, definitely check it out!",

    "text": "I think that this place is perfect for those who don't know good food, and certainly don't know good steak/chophouses. The atmosphere is pretty ok, hence two stars instead of one, but the food is atrocious. This is by far one of the worst steaks I've ever had, and the other items we've tried have been terrible on numerous occasions as well. The crab cakes are nothing more than fishy bread patties, the stuffed dates are so overwhelmingly greasy and rich, they're inedible. I suppose my side salad was ok, but it's relatively difficult to mess up lettuce with the dressing on the side. Note that the only protein you can really add to a salad here is shrimp... at $8 per piece of shrimp.   The wine selection is dismal at best, and that leads me to my next point - this restaurant is gratuitously pretentious for the sake of being pretentious. The menu boasts a $20k ZD pairing dinner for up to 12 people. Come again? ZD is far from a premier Napa vineyard compared to the likes of Caymus, Duckhorn, Cakebread et al, but I digress. Further - during wine season at Wright's, where the wine dinners are just as many courses and include the vineyards I just mentioned, each seat is only $125 per person. Anyhow, my point is that this place is great for people who don't actually understand what good food is, or what a restaurant experience at this price point should be, but hey. More powr to these folks. We will not, however, return...",

We tried a lot last night, here were my favorites:  Noah's Mill bourbon Go Green (gin cocktail) Grilled octopus Blue cheese stuffed medjool dates The dry-aged tomahawk ribeye with bone marrow butter (adding the butter was such a good call) Sauteed wild mushrooms Brussel sprouts Key lime cheesecake Doughnut bread pudding  I ordered the imperial old fashioned with my steak but wasn't really a fan. I'm more of a classic old fashioned guy and this was too overpowering with the orange flavor. Next time I would probably just order a standard old fashioned with a lemon peel instead of orange and 1 sugar cube instead of a cherry.  I ordered the east coast sour with appetizers. Even though this is more fruity than I prefer with a cocktail, it was a really tasty drink and a good one to start the meal with.",

Our server was knowledgeable about the menu, dealt with our humor and excitement, and provided us excellent service by even bringing out a celebratory dessert. The food was incredible. My mom is a big fan of oyster Rockefeller so she specically asked the server if they could add Pernod in the dish since the restaurant doesn't usually prepare it that way. And guess what -- the chef did it and it certainly pleased the birthday girl! The restaurant was more than accommodating and truly impressed us. I can't recommend a specific thing because I guarantee the entire menu is equally as delicious as what I ordered. 5/5. Thanks for making my mom's birthday dinner so memorable!",

Pros: Staff & Service is quite good Knife service is a nice touch Asparagus good and not over salted (not sure it needs the fried egg on top tho lol) Mushrooms were good and not over salted  Cons: The octopus appetizer was a valid attempt but would skip especially for the price  We had the tomahawk cut to share for two people to share. The only reason I've given three stars instead of four is because the Tomahawk was seasoned well, however was a bit too raw in the middle. I don't mind cooked on the outside and pink in the center, but for such a nice dry aged cut of meat cooked on the outside and right in the center is more reserved for sushi.",

I chose this place for my birthday dinner celebration on a Sunday night. The private room was not given to me however the table we had was nice.  Food was top notch! From the appetizers to entrees to desserts I did not find a complaint.  But the service is really why this place deserves full score: our waiter, Jeff, was phenomenal. He properly introduced himself, explained the menu and satisfied every request. Large parties are not easy to handle but I saw everyone was happy both with the food and the service.  If you order steak (I highly recommend it), they let you choose your steak knife. First time I saw this and I was impressed.  Wine selection is also fair. At the end of the dinner a free abundant dessert was given to me, and it's always a joy when a restaurant does that. Highly recommend. I will be back!",

Who gonna try some? Who gonna Yelp them, when the time comes? Bourbons & Bones, Bourbons & Bones  Bourbon & Bones is a hot trendy steak house in the heart of Oldtown Scottsdale.  Swanky bar and the vibe to assure you're in for an interesting evening.    We came for a friend birthday gathering.  Whiskey, wine, and beer was flowing, but let's jump in to the food!  We started with some oysters and calamari.  Oysters came with cocktail sauce, vinegar, and horseradish; nice bite to start!  The calamari were breaded to a crisp while the oysters were cool and slurpy; yeah no such word, but I'm making it up!  I ordered their special of the night; wedge salad, bacon wrapped filet, and ending with a creme brulee.  The wedge salad was solid well topped with blue cheese and bacon.  I ordered my filet medium which I think I should have ordered medium rare.  I found it a tad bit dry that night.  For our sides we went for the sauteed corn, roasted broccoli, mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, and Truffled Lobster mac and cheese.  My favorite of the bunch had to be the Truffled Lobster mac and cheese; the scent of truffle oil while the subtle cheesy bite was music to the palates.  To top it off my creme brulee was nice way to end.  Solid sugar atop a soft creamy custard.    In the end, Bourbon & Bones has a great atmosphere for a steak dining.  I really love the service here since they were on top of it and multiple servers filling up your plate during the main course.  I didn't care for my filet, but maybe it was an off day and if I come back I'll shoot for the bone in filet; maybe that'll give it some juice.  My first whiskey came along with a fruit fly, but they were quick to replace it.  I'm not one to freak out about finding bugs in food cause it happens and will continue to happen everywhere; more protein I always say! - Enjoy!",

Well when i get there i was given a table... i questioned the booth and the reply i got was.   Sorry but we gave ur table to a bigger party....    i asked then why did i make a resv for a table...    and not one person answered me.     They all looked at me that i had 3 heads......      So we decided to take our table of 4 to a different restaurant.... And we found an amazing Italian restaurant....",

As it turns out, it's not exactly the type of place you pop into, it's a pretty fancy menu. I had the scallop meal which was delicious. The tomato and onion salad was a different story. It was literally just pieces of cut up plain tomato and onions. The pieces were much too thick. That being said, everything else made up for it... the ambience, the crowd, the windows that open up so it has an outside feel, etc. 5 stars for Bourbon & Bones!",

Essentially 5 star review is based on how our waitress Tina and the manager Frank handled our disastrous meal...long story short 2/3 entrees were cooked to the point of being inedible. Not only were the meals replaced and recooked properly and ultimately delicious it was the genuine care in which they both showed to make sure they did right by us and our experience. Because of that I would definitely going back knowing the people care and I wouldn't expect the meals to be cooked poorly again. Well done to the team there for making a potentially disastrous experience into a positive memory!",

A bit overcooked but still had good flavor. But not worth the money they were charging. What most shocked me was the price on the alcohol. I was taken back by the prices of the cocktails. For the price I paid I would rather go down the street to City Hall. Better service and higher quality. Even our server laughed when I made mention of the pricing. He said he hears that a lot.        The food overall was good. But in Scottsdale, there are far better choices for food and drink for less money. The restaurant decor was nice and clean. But the pricing will ensure I do not go back.",

When you can't cook a burger to the requested temperature there is a problem but when you order 3 burger and none of them are even close to how we ordered them this is major problem. So when we decide to have them remake us new burgers they came back almost raw and cold to the touch this is a disaster.  However we appreciated the manager taking the burgers off the bill your restaurant should be ashamed you're supposed to be what I call a high end steakhouse and you can't even cook a good burger.   Just a side note,  We do come into your restaurant a lot and this is not the first time we received free food  and this is not the way to be a successful restaurant.",

Not sure what kind of tomatoes they use to top the salmon, but I did not enjoy them at all. They tasted spoiled. I also ordered the Mac n cheese, Brussels sprouts, and calamari. The calamari was very good and so were the Brussels sprouts. I expected the Mac n cheese to be a little more rich, with truffle oil and some crumbs, but it fell short of my expectations and was not that great.  I liked the facial towels. They smelled like mint or eucalyptus. I also like getting the option to pick a knife out of the wooden box. The knives were beautiful.  The service was good too.",

My wife started with the French Onion Soup & she said it was good (not the best she's ever had but solid).    For dinner, my wife went with the petite file wrapped in bacon & said it was good. It was cooked perfectly and had good flavor. I went with the short rib over mashed potatoes with broccoli. It was just ok as it wasn't the most tender or flavorful short rib I've had. In hindsight probably would have ordered differently.   For dessert I got the gluten-free chocolate mousse (had a GF cookie on top) and it was very good!  Delicious flavor & rich.  My wife went with the butter cake and she loved it. The fresh strawberries were perfect with it.  Overall we weren't happy with Bourbon & Bones and would like to come back to experience the non-restaurant week menu as well.",

They have a very cool open bar area that have nice high tops large enough for groups of 4 (possibly 5 if you want to pull up a chair at the head of the table). It's basically a steak house but there are food entrees and you could easily sit at the bar for drinks and just order an appetizer and leave happy.  The wagyu hot rock is a fun one to try - they bring you the meat and a very hot rock for you to lay the meat on to cook yourself. This is my favorite appetizer here. I've had the filet, miso cod and several sides - the food is good but I prefer other steakhouses in the area for a full blown meal. But for ambiance, a nice bottle of wine, and a couple appetizers, this place is definitely worth checking out.",

    "text": "6 STARS! Just Go. Close my review now and make your reservation.   Ok, if you really feel like reading more I will oblige. From the moment you walk in the hip vibe and feeling of fine dining will engulf you. Without the stuffy atmosphere of the traditional steak house Bourbon & Bones will provide you with a high class, high energy, hip evening.   My first recommendation... start with The Devils Cut, Hot Rock Wagyu Beef appetizer. Yes, it is a little bit of cooking your own food at the table but it is well worth it and a great way to get the conversation going around the table. Of course the other thing that always helps open up conversation is a good drink menu; and that, Bones has in spades. Their Moscow Mule is fantastic and of course they have 1 or 2 or 100 bourbons. Also, wine on tap helps expand their by the glass selections size.   Service was top notch. Just what you would expect from this level of steak house but without the gruffness and snotty waiter that can all too often accompany this level of steak house. Our waiter was great with recommendations, had a sense of humor, and was just in general really great.   My FAVORITE MOMENT.....The staff arrives with what almost looks like a wooden box of cigars but upon opening it is a selection of steak knives in a felt lined box; all different, different handles and different sizes. So simple and a little thing but SOooo COOL. Each guest picked out their knife for their meat cutting enjoyment.  I selected a full size, full tang, drop point with a mother of pearl inlay in the handle.   As far as the food goes...well, it's tough to go wrong here. Everyone at my table thoroughly enjoyed their meal. From oysters and tuna tar-tar to lamb and of course bone in ribeyes and bone in filets, they have it all, and all was perfectly done. Start with a Cesar salad and then head for your steak and sides. Don't forget the sides. My goodness what delicious sides all very deserving of the traditional A la cart menu.   Have you seen enough? Like I side. Just make your reservation and go.",

They fit a lot of people in what felt like a small place so it can be loud but still worth checking out.  Our server was very knowledgeable and I am a fan when they actually give recommendations. We had our eye on the beef carpaccio to start but he said they were out. Next time hopefully.  So we started with the fried calamari. Wasn't the best I've had but I liked the addition of shishito peppers and pepperchinis .  I got the French onion soup. Very sweet and rich. Couldn't eat the whole bowl. But flavorful.  For our meat feasts. Husband got the ribeye with truffle butter and I got the filet Oscar style.  It's typically my go to when I go to a steakhouse and this one was prob one of the bests I've had. They piled on the asparagus and solid crab legs topped with bernaise sauce. Very very good. Only issue was they need to clean the crab better. There was still some cartilage inside of the crab when I ate it that made it less appetizing.   Sides was Mac n cheese and Brussels.  The Brussels were a Recommendation from the server and did not disappoint.  Dessert they brought us butter cake and strawberries.   Overall very good meal!p",

The waitress was very knowledgeable in all of her recommendations and pairings! Everyone had a great meal that took her advice. We started off with the crab cakes tuna tar tar and oysters. The oysters were fresh and cleaned perfectly - so easy to eat. Same for the tuna tar tar. The chef here is great with his craft. And the steak was cooked like butter. Perfect seer on the outside and red and juicy on the inside. Couldn't ask for a better cut and cooked steak. Now this is a fancy steak house so everything is priced accordingly. Very good experience from walking in to eating and valet out. Highly recommend.",

We arrived just a few minutes prior to our reservation, however our table wasn't ready for another 10-15 minutes later.  No big deal though, the place was packed, and they acknowledged us a couple of times apologizing for the delay.  Once we were seated, we were treated to a wonderful dining experience.  I mean, we even got to pick out the knives we wanted to cut our steak with!   My husband and I ordered cocktails, shared the oysters Rockefeller, a Caesar salad, tomahawk steak, brussel sprouts, and the strawberry butter cake.  Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious!   Yes, this restaurant is on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for.  Our dinner was exceptional, and so was the service.   Looking forward to our visit to Scottsdale next year, and we will definitely be dining at Bourbon and Bones Chop House and Bar once again.",

On paper this place looks great.  I had a different experience on my visit, first I was shocked at the prices, It is the most expensive restaurant in Old town. I was honestly expecting a more casual restaurant. Prices are high and I am sure the team here is aiming high as well, but my meal and service fell short, that happens, also sometimes with busy openings things don't go as well as expectations. I will chalk it up just being new and an off night by a new server and overwhelmed kitchen.  I live in the area and I am sure I will eventually get back, but at least it will be knowing that its a very expensive casual/upscale loud open steakhouse.  revised review JV",

As you would expect from the name their meat selections are fantastic. The only reason I gave them four instead of five stars is the ambiance of the dinning room. It is located on Scottsdale Blvd in Old Town Scottsdale and while the dining room is nicely appointed, you are sitting in a room with large windows all around looking at the traffic pass by.  Not a big deal but it does distract from what would be a 5-star evening.  And, if you happen to like Manhattans, they make the best Manhattan I have ever had by far.  I highly recommend this place.

This place has a huge semi covered outside seating with a bar ~ reminiscent of Sol restaurant style.   I had their house Manhattan martini- it's a bourbon martini, I think.  All I know is that after just that one drink ~ I was a goner. Of course, my alcohol tolerance level is low. Still, it was a good, very stiff drink. We also enjoyed shrimp cocktail and oysters (what kind escaped me after that martini) which was fresh and firm.  Next, their filet mignon was cooked to perfection (rare) and delicious.  Now, their bourbon butter cake deserves an award! Absolutely delish and had to hold myself back from licking the plate.   One odd thing I did notice is that they have ninja servers and bus peeps and I swear if I blink, they clear something off of the table so quickly, I thought I was just seeing, err, unseeing things.  It was weird. Maybe they want you to leave as soon as you're done??  Lastly, it's just my personal opinion, but, the type of foods and drinks, whiskey and bourbons, emphasized for this place, just doesn't seem to belong together. The feel of place is more of new American cuisine with vodka mix drinks.    Personally, for rich steaks, bourbons, scotch drinks and looking at a very similar price points; I'll go to places like Dominic's, steak 44 or City Hall for the befitting ambiance.  I'd come here for HH with friends for some unique cocktails and some fun. Not recommend for romantic dinners though.",

Still a very nice dinner spot, while avoiding the outrageous bill. Awesome bourbon selection, by far the most in depth that I've seen around Phoenix. The old fashion is a must try drink.",

    "text": "What a score finding this place! We were struggling with finding a good steak but didn't want to go to one of the typical places, this place delivered the steak but in a much more fun and cool and friendly atmosphere. The food was outstanding and we both got the bone in filet and New York steak that was fantastic. It was a bit overcooked so I would go down a rarity if you're looking for something more on the rare side Medium was more like medium well.. The sides are great and I emphasize the cauliflower was amazing The bourbon selection at the end was a highlight with the great ice balls and killer selection. I could use better wines by the glass but it was still nothing to worry about. Bartenders are great. Fun and open environment on  a warm night. Loved it..",

We ordered a little of everything:  Oysters were excellent.  Tomato and onion salad was everything we expected.   Pretzel bread was yummy!   Ribeye was just ok. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, just not the best quality I have had for the price.   Corn side was ok, I'd skip it next time. Nothing too special. Could have used a little kick of flavor. Maybe more salt?  Sherried wild mushrooms were also nothing special, we have had better (stronger) flavor at other steakhouses.   Martini pours and wine by the glass pours are generous.   Pretty sexy place, great vibe for a date night. Service was excellent too. We might not go back to order a steak again because there is better execution in town by other steakhouses, but I will be back for cocktails, wine, and snacks.",

    "text": "3 of us went tonight for the first time. They definitely have a very nice selection of spirits and wine. Will not go wrong there. Had drinks at the bar before going to table and the bartender was prompt, and courteous. Wine, Woodford neat, and a dirty martini were ordered. Good pours. For the food we started out with their shrimp cocktail. This was really good. Very good size pieces, nice and cold, and cocktail sauce came with additional horseradish to add more kick to it. Would definitely recommend. They also provide complimentary pieces of thick cut candied bacon (had at bar before table) and warm bread prior to main dishes (at table), both were very good and are nice beforehand. The server did a good job of explaining the menu in detail. She also was quick with drinks and water was re-filled in a fast manner throughout. For dinner we did a 10oz Filet, and their bone in New York. The other guest ordered a crab seafood plate, and their tomato/mozzarella/balsamic plate. He said both were good. Both steaks ordered medium rare. The Filet was perfect, however, the NY seemed slightly above that. Im not one for complaining, as it was still very flavorful. They also brought out a variety of steak knives for you to pick your preference to cut with. For the sides we did a loaded baked potato and their regular Mac and cheese. Both were great, and everything came out on hot plates. Dessert was the apple crumble dish with ice cream this was excellent. Two of us ordered coffee afterwards and came out hot and prompt with all fix-ins. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because in my personal opinion, I feel if I had to choose between B&B and Steak 44, or if someone was new to AZ and asked for a steak house recommendation, for me, it's Steak 44. This is a good restaurant though. I don't want anyone to think 4 stars is a bad thing by any means. It is 4.5, just not an option on Yelp. I tried to put as much detail in my review as possible. I took some time to read through others reviews before coming tonight, and I don't think some of the bad ones are that factual. I feel some people took it to the extreme and a lot of comments just didn't seem accurate based on our experience. The service was very good. I would definitely go back.",

We started off with the House Salad, which consists of field greens, candied pecans, dried cranberries, balsamic vinaigrette and goat cheese. It was just average...too many field greens and not enough topping and dressing. We had higher hopes for the entree, but were sorely disappointed. We split the 10 oz filet and desired to have it cooked to medium well. We were presented with a rare steak that was almost impossible to eat. In fact, I had to descreetly take out of my mouth four pieces that were not chewable. Someone should tell the chef that the silverskin (the sllimy, shiny thin skin on a piece of beef) should be removed. With the bernaise sause, it was still tasteless. We also ordered two sides. The creamed spinach was not chopped (in fact the spinach stem was still attached) and did not have a True cream sauce to it. It was a thin, watery sauce without taste. The corn off the cob was frozen corn with some stuff stirred into it. I could not identify what the stuff was. On top of the meal being horrible, this place is overpriced. As far as the food overall, it was like someone opened a place and not knew what they were doing. It was not run like a fine steakhouse. Tourist....if you want steak, there are many fine places in the Valley...City Hall, Mastros, Flemings, Donovens, Ruth Chris. While its location is great, the food is not.",

The food was so incredible, and the customer service was even better! Our only regret is that we didn't eat a full dinner, so we went back the next night. My husband and I are extreme foodies, and have NEVER visited a restaurant two nights back to back while on vacation. Well, we went the second night for the steak, and again were blown away! The steak melted in your mouth, and the sides were incredible. The staff really made our experience amazing, and took the time to ensure we had everything we needed and had fun while doing so!!! This dining experience is in our top 3, and gives Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, Steak, a run for its money! Well done guys!",

I had a favorite here in town that I use to rate other places and not many hold a candle. However, Bourbon & Bones is now my new favorite. I don't know what magic they are working but the Bone in Ribeye I had was incredible. Maybe it is the \"wet aged process\" or the perfect amount of seasoning or the temperature and cooking technique, I don't know but whatever it is it is a perfect storm. I also enjoyed the fact bacon is brought out while you order. That was a great surprise. I had several of the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and they were perfect. The staff was very friendly and professional as well. I love the vibe of this place. It has good energy, great design and good flow. The open air concept and the fact it looks out over Scottsdale Road makes it very inviting. Bottom line is that you need to go.

Bartenders were great and accommodating... but almost $21 for a Tito's lemon drop? Last time I checked, I wasn't in Vegas or Miami. Definitely recommend just sticking with a Tito's \"specialty drink\" because they run about $15. Or just take your business to Hilstone and have a $14 lemon drop (that's just as delicious) with your $50 steak. I'm mostly disappointed because we were asked to move tables (by our server) while finishing up wine because they had another reservation? Sounds like the managers job to do NOT the server. I wouldn't even expect this from a chain restaurant. Our server was really great overall... she was super sweet, but when spending over $275 on dinner I EXPECT a good overall experience. There are SO many \"boujee\" restaurants spots that's are just as good and your overall experience will be much better.",

    "text": "Dined here during restaurant week, fall 2017.  Good service from our server; very personable and provided us with good drink recommendations and info about their menu.  Started with oysters. Fresh, good.  Caesar salad - fast food-like quality. Main course - Petite Filet, ordered medium rare, and came out medium to medium well. Sides were alright. Main course - Steak Frites, ordered medium rare, and came out medium to medium well. Frites weren't really seasoned, not anything special. Sides were alright. Dessert - Bourbon cake (came highly recommended): this was ok. Dessert - Cheesecake: was a tower of whipped cream. Actual cheesecake was a little bit on the light side; almost bland.  Hot towels were offered after oysters, so that was nice. Knife selection for the steak -- I suppose this is a 'neat' idea, but I asked the employee what he would recommend, and he was not really sure. So yes, this is an idea, but it would only get the brownie points under the assumption that their dining guests have an appreciation of, or at least know a tad bit, about knives and steak.  Three positive takeaways: server service was good, chimichurri was solid, and the restaurant layout was nice.  Food, not so much.",

We asked the waitress to send it back to be warmed and then waited for about 30 min, maybe more.  Waitress didn't seem to care so my husband finally went and asked someone to see if the manager was available.  When he came we were just shocked at how cocky he was. I believe his name was Randy. Anyhow he was an arrogant jerk and we ended up just leaving and going to Tommy V's and had the best meal and a great time.",

Well, it was nothing less than perfect! My date and I ate dinner at the bar and was served beautifully by Justin, bartender/waiter par excellence! He had a great personality, provided fabulous suggestions and was truly a joy.  He knows is stuff!  The shrimp cocktail is to die for....big, juicy and perfectly prepared chilled HUGE shrimp with a cocktail sauce that had the perfect amount of kick.  The bone in filet was gorgeous....medium rare and divine. The brownie dessert was amazing, although I was hesitant because he said it had toffee in the center....but delicious and every bit was eaten!  Yes, it is pricey....but what good steakhouse in the valley isn't?   Go. You will be very happy!",

    "text": "I have to give this place a firm B with a few extra  points for service, which is very good. The food? It's not bad either, but falls short stacked up next to some of the other steakhouses in the area, like Capital Grill or Don & Charlie's. I ordered a box car cut that came to the table cooked a notch or two past my medium rare request - slightly rubbery and not much sear or texture. I didn't pick up any signature flavors either. Surprisingly average. My cocktail order was odd too. I ordered a simple old fashioned with a decent bourbon and it came out looking like a cheap well drink with chipped ice. No large rock of ice, no orange peel. If you charge premium prices for drinks, and especially if you call yourself Bourbon & Bones, you have to nail the classics and bring some style to your cocktails. One other minor complaint. Even though it's a well designed restaurant with a nice modern look, if you're seated next to the bar it feels more like you're sitting in the bar. There's no buffer zone and it was difficult to have dinner conversation. Relatively new place and I may try it again after they work out a few kinks.",

Our server Jeffrey was informative, personable and really knew what he was talking about. The manager checked in with us multiple times to ensure our food was cooked perfectly (he even circled back around to make sure I had tried everything). You're able to choose your own knife for your steak and have phenomenal toppings, I had my filet Oscar style. They defiantly did not skimp on any of the food either! Great wine selection and variety on the menu. I will recommend this restaurant to friends and visit again my next time in Scottsdale.",

My good friend was visiting from Chicago and said she wanted to dine at an upscale restaurant where we could enjoy a good steak and bottle of wine. This place nailed it, with a packed house during Restaurant Week on a Friday night to boot!  The service was impeccable. Within moments of sitting down we had a gentleman greeting us and asking for our drink choices. From then until we finished our meal and left, the staff worked nonstop to make sure every table in the restaurant was taken care of at all times with drinks, bread, and water.   The food came out, perfectly timed. For RW, they had a 3 course meal option. My friend and I both chose the caesar salad, Petite Filet with mashed potatoes and sauteed corn, cheesecake for dessert. It was simple in presentation but the flavor was out of this world on ALL fronts. I asked for medium rare and got exactly that. This steak was juicy, each bite was incredible!  Unique touch allowing patrons to select their own steak knife.   Can't forget to mention the killer high tops with the open-window seating looking at Scottsdale Rd. If you're looking for a fun Friday night date spot or Girls Night Out, check this place out.",

The team is friendly, outgoing, and fun.  1. Sit in the bar.  You get Bar Bacon for an aperitif.  It's amazing. Trust me. 2. The pretzel bread is perfectly cooked every time.  Moist and fluffy on the inside with a  salted crispy outside. 3. I had the filet.  It was was cooked exactly to the temp I ordered and the seasoning tasted great.  They season a bit more than  some of my other favorite steak houses but it's still really, really good. 4. Get the Bourbon Pecan Butter cake.  The cake has a slightly caramelized crust and is topped with vanilla ice cream.  I like my desserts extra sweet, which this was, but then the bourbon cut that sweetness and added a tad bit of a Smokey flavor and I loved it!  I've also had the burger here.

    "text": "Unimpressed but enjoyable. My family and I decided to check this place out for the first time during restaurant week since the  menu for this occasion sounded interesting enough. We started off with The Devils Cut,  (not included with Restaurant week menu) a delicious sliced Wagyu beef appetizer that you cook at the table to your preference. Definitely the highlight of the meal! Unfortunately the fact that our second course was brought out simultaneously knocks one star off in my book. This is a big no no! One shouldn't feel rushed and should be able to fully enjoy each course. Next the house salad was ok though over dressed and the smoked tomato bisque  was just not right in the flavor department. For the main course our filets were cooked perfectly and were quite enjoyable. To finish off the panna cotta and the monkey bread were nothing memorable.  Since this place opened up we had been wanting to check it out in hopes of finding another great spot to dine in. Unfortunately this was not the case. City Hall remains our top spot and then Flemmings for a more casual Steakhouse choice. While they have City Hall pricing, their decor is lacking and more reminiscent of a fancy Dennys, (take away the leather booths and  scattered wall accents and the layout is the same) and the service lacks the attentiveness and elegance one can expect at a True fine dining steakhouse.",

Our waiter Jeff did an excellent job - very attentive and helpful with suggestions. We split a house salad to start (YUM), then my husband got the wagyu New York strip and I got the salmon, and we split the truffle mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. All of it was so, so good. Steak was tender, the glaze on the salmon was scrumptious, and the sides were just delicious. Then, Jeff surprised us with the bourbon pecan butter cake for dessert. We've never had a dessert so addictive. We were completely full and still finished it! I would order this every time and can't say enough about this dessert. Overall, amazing meal and will recommend Bourbon & Bones to anyone we know, and will come back!",

The wine list is well conceived, however it would be nice to see more \"By the Glass\" offerings from differing producers.

    "text": "I would have given a negative if I could, as the ONLY reason we came here this night was for prime rib (continue with the review). I will say though;great crab cakes, but I didn't drive all the way there for an appetizer. Long story short. I called them last week to make sure I could get an END CUT of prime rib... a True end cut, that any real chef would understand. The gal who put me on hold to talk to the chef assured me he would put one aside for Monday night and understood exactly what I was looking for in prime rib. This was a double birthday celebration for my husband and me and we wanted great prime rib. The so-called end cut they brought me was simply a piece of prime rib/roast beef that was cooked well done-it in no way shape or form was an end cut. Either the chef did not know what an end cut was OR he thought I was an idiot and would think a well done slab of roast beef was an end cut. I took one bite and the rest sat there until it was boxed up to bring home to my dogs. Was a bit surprised that our waitress didn't ask me if there was a problem-thats poor service in itself. Never asked either of us how our meal was, but then again-mine sat there uneaten, so....hello? My husband got a medium rare slice -looked just like mine, except medium rare (which, by the way, was tasteless, gummy and the worst he's had in years). I did not say a word when she put the plate down in front of me because frankly, I was shocked (I probably should have and that's on me). As a rule, we do not send food back; we just never come back and make sure our friends know of our experience. This was to be a special meal -a double birthday dinner that I told the reservation gal about and no.... they never wished us a happy birthday. It's a busy (loudplace and has great appetizers, which we probably would have come back again for, but the meal we had looked forward to was just awful and frankly, if I wanted a slab of over-cooked roast beef, I'd go to a place like Denny's.",

    "text": "This place is quite the restaurant - wonderful selection of food choices and types. The menu is awesome. I'd say it's probably one of the new, better quality restaurants in Old Town. Quite surprisingly, I read some of the previous Yelp reviews to be a little shocked at some of the -ve reviews. I definitely did not have this experience at all.. We booked through OpenTable and had a booth.. we were on a double date night with friends, so we knew we were committed for the long haul of the evening.  Were seated by the hostess immediately inside (there is also bar and high-top table seating) and were presented with the menu, the wine and cocktail list.. I always prefer to start off with a beer to cleanse the palate before a good meal, and so the boys had an IPA (Hop Knot) and the girls G&T and a Berried Alive (from the cocktail menu).  There were lots of wonderful selections on the menu - making a decision on the starters was fun and allowed us to share across the table. We did have to find GF food choices, but the quality of GF these days is amazing and you honestly cannot tell the difference.  So we started with 1/2 dozen West Coast oysters, which were sooo tasty. The Tomato Mozzarella salad was also really nice and fresh. We didn't want to over heat on the starters so stuck with just the two. We had a non-red meat eater also, so a fish choice from their waiters specials menu was on order as well. The girls went the petite filet (one with the peppercorn sauce (which was surprisingly over-sweet - very unlike a normal peppercorn flavor) and a bearnaise sauce, which was the star of the 2 sauces. Perfectly cooked at medium rare. I had the Colorado Lamb Chop, also medium rare, which was huge (compared to a regular lamb chop anyway!). Looked like it came from a massive beast!!  We all agreed the meals were outstanding - presentation wise (please see images) but flavor-wise too. My only real comment on the lamb was that it was really quite fatty - sure fat adds flavor, but I had to trim excessive amounts off the chops. However the meat was very nicely flavoured, cooked perfectly, but somewhat different from a traditional Australian or New Zealand lamb chop (these are a generally sweeter, gamier meat).  Our waiter also brought out a series of different steak knives for choice in a case - which as really nice being offered the choice of your own knife, as opposed to having a standard steak knife just laid out.. Really nice touch..  To pair with these meals, we chose an Australian Shiraz - the Peter Lehman 'Portrait' series from 2014, which is an exceptional wine (and vintage season) for the price on the menu (and not expensive either). I had this decanted when we ordered our starters, so it was nicely aerating and opening by the time it arrived to our table. It was a definite winner all round so when the bottle dried up, we grabbed another. Uber was our mode of transport, so we wanted to be able to enjoy our wine and not be worried about driving. I have had this wine many times before when in Australia, so our US friend relished the varietal differences between our countries..  Sides we went with were the country mashed potatoes, the grilled and truffled asparagus spears with egg and the grilled broccoli. These sides paired easily with the main courses, so overall was a fairly easy dining choice.  Next we hit the dessert menu, although we were planning on skipping it at the time. However, our waiter said they had some pretty nice desserts worth looking at, so we decided to go family style with 3 different ones (maintaining our GF choices on 2 out of the 3).. Vanilla creme brulee (with the cookie dough in a small dish on the side (allowed us to share with our GF friend), the Banana Fosters Twinkie cheesecake (which is not on the menu (but a concoction from one of the dessert/pastry chefs who came and spoke to us about it) and the White Chocolate Bread Pudding.. All were really nice, not overtly rich but also satisfying on flavors and size.. Well rounded finish to the evening, thats for sure..",

Let's not forget the location is perfect and the vibe is spot on. We started with the crab cakes and they were the best I've ever had. To drink my husband had an Old Fashion and he said it was perfection. I tried the Berried Alive to start. It was good but the Fizzing Flower will definitely be my drink of choice next time. I had the filet with bone marrow butter. I won't order a steak WITHOUT the bone marrow butter. Seriously, so much flavor and a definite must! We had two shareable sides, mushrooms... so delicious and mac n cheese. I wasn't a huge fan of the Caesar dressing or the Mac n Cheese. But they wouldn't stop me from going back considering the caliber of the other food, drinks and service. We had Clint as our server and can't say enough how amazing he truly was. Looking forward to going back and my mouth is watering thinking of the food as I write this. Don't forget to make reservations!",

Next the bone in filet- one of the best, most tastey and tender I've ever had (sorry Dominic's and Mastro's).  And off course, bourbon.   The choices are extreme.  Next, the $35,000 Epic Crystal dinner.   As a local, we will be back even more after our welcomed tourists leave for the north.  Great job by the staff (Jared and Andrew), our server (Katya) and the team in the kitchen.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this restaurant but came away a bit let down.  Overall it's not a bad place, it's simply not on par with other steakhouses in the same price range.   The atmosphere was a bit like eating a steak at a club. My wife and I had to shout at each other. Granted, it was Friday night, but the boxy layout filled with flat reflective surfaces would probably make it loud any time.   They offer 70 or so types of bourbon, which is great. We love bourbon and had a couple of glasses. I could definitely see this place as a good spot to have drinks with friends who also appreciate quality bourbon.  The food however, was not particularly impressive. I got a filet that was cooked very inconsistently. I ordered it medium plus, which many steakhouses don't seem to understand, and it came out half overdone and half underdone. It also lacked the natural flavor I expect from a $50 steak. They offer several sauces for a couple of bucks more but I don't believe quality meat requires bearnaise.   The bread bowl had an odd mix of rolls that were unimpressive. We shared grilled asparagus that really had no fantastic flavor. For on plate addictions my wife got some crab claws with bearnaise and asparagus. The crab claws were sort of funny in that they were tiny and difficult to get the meat out of. I opted for their lobster fingers which were lobster pieces baked in filo dough. These might have been pretty good but a strong lemon flavor overpowered the meat. My wife liked them, I did not.   We skipped dessert as nothing offered had chocolate, and with so many options nearby, like Gelato Spot across the street, the menu didn't inspire us to try anything.   Ultimately, if you're looking for a night out in old town for drinks with friends, and food isn't your primary concern, Bourbon and Bones is fine. If you're wanting a great steak with outstanding sides, desserts, and details where you can hear your dinner companions, it's not the best. Roaring Fork is a mile up the road and it never disappoints.",

Service was also fantastic and we were not rushed through our meal.   My friend and I shared the Oysters Rockefeller - way too much for two people as an appetizer. The oysters were very tender, not over cooked and there was enough spinach and sauce on the dish to make it memorable however, there was a little too much bacon for our taste. For the main coarse we both had the petite filet, which was very generous in size and very tender. Both steaks were cooked to perfection. The grilled Brussels Sprouts were also fantastic. All in all a fantastic experience and exactly what we expected for the price.",

Very disappointing and we will not be returning.  Do yourself a favor and go to a different steakhouse; there are many great options.  Service was okay.  Not great & definitely not spectacular.  Definitely not on par with their prices.  Mastro's, Oceanclub, and Steak 44 blow this place out of the water.  Waiter kept the wine glasses on the table until we piled them up in the corner (this was after taking the drink order and no one ordering wine).  Waiter packaged all our food together, which I felt was incredibly sloppy (multiple couples who were obviously not going to be going back to the same location).  No one asked if our steaks were cooked to the appropriate temperature.  Food was okay.  Nothing spectacular.  I didn't think my filet was well seasoned; actually none of the steaks at the table were that fabulous (including their $95 ribeye).  if you're looking for setting, I thought the setting was good.  A little noisy but that's to be expected in Olde Towne.  Rather attractive setting imo.  This is the only thing that this restaurant has going for it.",

My first visits were when the weather was a bit cooler and it is super cool that the windows come out and create a patio so it's a good ambiance on a nice day. Since it's hot now of course a no go. Servers are always nice and managers come by and check on you so that's nice. Best thing about this place is their hh burger which is amazing. Worst thing is you can only order it during happy hour which sucks because in my opinion it's better than their steaks!  Best sides are the brussel sprouts and the mac and cheese is pretty yum too. Drinks are good, bartenders are awesome. I would probably have given it a 3.5 but you can't so I rounded up. The reason being is that it is a steakhouse and I have tried their steaks twice- the bone in rib eye and the filet and both were decent but not amazing. In my opinion the steak at a steakhouse should be amazing. They have other things that are though which is why I've been back a few times. I also like that it's a good crowd but not over crowded like some of the old town spots. I'll be back. Especially for the hh burger and fries or Mac and cheese and calamari.",

    "text": "Just finishing up my goody bag delights from last night's EXCELLENT dinner at this fabulous restaurant.  We're always on the prowl for a new and different dinner spot but after eating here this will be our go to - so many selections and if we can go by our meals from last night (salads, petit filet, salmon, topped off with outrageously delicious desserts of cookie sandwich and apple crumble) we will back to sample more.  My husband was also hooked on our server Zack's suggestion of bourbon, so much so he had seconds. The wine list from which I chose also provided several excellent selections. If you're deciding where to have dinner in or around Old Towne Scottsdale, hands down - it's Bourbon & Bones!",

(reminds me of fast food place because of that) They need to add a wall in front of the door area to separate it.  When eating you consistently find yourself looking at all the new people arriving.  For the money it should be a bit more private.",

Kind of place that assumes it produces a good product because it charges a certain price and hopes you'll buy into that.  Vegas-ish mindset. You'll find a better steak, setting, and service about a mile north at Maestros City Hall.",

    "text": "If you see my reviews, you'll see I rarely take the time to write a negative review but this place warrants it.  I was so excited to try Bourbon n Bones.  The place looks cool as you drive by and the vibe is engaging.  But that's where my praise ends.  The food is mediocre AT best! The service is sooooo bad that even if the food was worth the wait you'd be annoyed anyway.  The bar is filled with great energy as far as clientele BUT the \"bar manager\" has to be the rudest man I've ever encountered in the business.  When I asked about a specific bourbon ( I guess it is one that they did not carry) he responded annoyed, \" No lady, but I have a hundred other bourbons you could try!\" ... not only the fact that he said \"lady\" in a tone that was condescending but his attitude was pompous!   (Not to mention there was a story behind the bourbon I had requested that may have been interesting to this particular venue!) At the table, that we had a reservation for ... (we waited 45 minutes past that time) We were a party of 8!  the food came out at different times... some of it cold. We ordered a steak medium well ... it came rare! That wouldn't matter but when we asked our waitress to cook it a little more she said I'll be back for it and didn't return for 16 minutes.   By the time she brought our order back it was 25 minutes after everyone else at the table had been served and finished their meals.  The people watching is superb but the service and quality do NOT warrant the high price tag.  Have a drink... don't ask for anything off the bar menu and dine elsewhere.  There are so many wonderful restaurants in this general area crossing this off will make your choices a little easier.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I made a reservation here for dinner a few days in advance. We were excited to try it out since it had just opened not to long ago and they had a good selection of bone-in steaks. When we arrived 10 minutes before our 8 pm reservation, we checked in and were informed that they needed a few moments. We ended up waiting for about 30 minutes and finally got a seat on the patio. We were thankful for that because the fish smell was overwhelming on the dining room side of the building. We were greeted by a friendly server very quickly and ordered margarita and a martini; both priced a little high. They were good after they arrived, it took about 20 minutes. After our drinks had got there, a gentleman walked up to our table and asked my boyfriend to turn his hat around. Really?! I didn't realize we were paying 20 bucks a round for our drinks and over 300 dollars to eat a steak in a nightclub?!? I was a little peeved. We shrugged it off and ordered our meals. They also took a while; I was hoping it meant that the food was going to be really good. Well, my boxcar strip steak was ordered medium, it came out rare/not even warm in the center and tough and hard as a rock on the outside. I ended asking for them to throw it back on and ate my $12 baked potato while we waited. It was very loud, everything takes forever and is extremely overpriced. We do not mind going to dinner and spending a bit of money, but I feel like we wasted it here. It was disappointing, to say the least.",

We moved to a different seat at the bar. The bartenders apologized profusely and bought us a round of drinks. No one ended up sitting at these \"reserved seats at the bar\" so the bartenders moved us back. The bar staff was phenomenal. Manager was a complete tool. Let me know when you let him go and we'll be back for drinks.",

My husband had a t-bone and I had the halibut special. We were accompanied by our 21-month-old son, who isn't usually too welcome in most steakhouses. He is always on his best behavior and was this evening as well. The Chef brought him strawberries and bananas and the staff was super friendly. They even played hide and seek with him, which kept him entertained and enjoying the experience as well. We will definitely be back!",
