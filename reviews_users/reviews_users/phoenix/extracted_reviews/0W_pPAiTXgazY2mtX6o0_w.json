    "text": "Hmmm... This review is probably one of the most difficult to write.   I live within 3 miles of this restaurant. I have driven past many times and always wondered what it was about.  when I saw the reviews on yelp I thought it was worth a try.  However I really don't understand why people would give this four stars. It's a cheap and not very good burger joint... With some hot dogs and want to be sausages.  I ordered it Thai and meet and sausage sandwich... And it was just a big soggy nasty mess. Not very appetizing and not very good at all.  The french fries are like you buy from the store frozen Oreda. They're not well cooked or well seasoned or unique at all.    The salad bar is a joke... It looks like a mess and not very good options or tasty offerings.  The hamburgers are plain and disgusting. Not much thought no uniqueness. It's not even as good as cooking at home.  The chocolate cake was disgusting.   People will review saying it's cheap and good... But it's not even cheap. You and up paying nearly 5 bucks for a hamburger and fries. Smash burger is far better for the same money.  I really have a hard time understanding what people see in this place.",

Portillo's is really big and as crowded as it gets, and it does get crowded, there is always a place to sit.  Lines can be long at times but move swiftly.  The staff is courteous and efficient.  Portillo's is set up with an order counter, a pick up counter and general seating.  The menu is large.  I had the Italian beef sandwich with a generous dunk of gravy.  I was surprised to find the spices I did on the meat; I did get red pepper flakes and wish I would have known as I am allergic.  It was still tasty though.    Do I crave Portillos'?  No.  Would I make the drive just to go get Portillo's?  No.  Would I eat here again.  Sure, when in the area.",

My first review of Portillo's got removed by Yelp HQ...something I said about their Italian sausage resembling a d^#k they didn't care for, I guess.  Phallic shaped foods in my book are simply the best. They're fun to eat. They're also fun to dangle, pretend suck, angrily bite, and wave around when no-one is looking except your wife.   Their Italian sausage sandwich is delicious with its hint of fennel and anise flavoring, a must in any good Italian sausage.  Their all beef hot dog is good too. Nice and flimsy, and long too, good for waving around, signaling your naughty intentions for later.   The fries, onion rings and shakes are all pretty decent.  The bill was twenty bucks and I didn't get laid afterward.  She might want to apply for a job at Yelp HQ.",

Perfect place if you're looking for a quick bite to eat but not wanting to compromise quality. They have salads as well, but from what I'm told these are flown in frozen then thawed- whereas the burgers are fresh. If you're craving something sweet- the chocolate cake is delish too! Perfect for the kiddos as well.",

Please take that as a disclaimer.  In this case, I visited the renowned Portillo's Hot Dogs and ordered what?  A vegetable sandwich.  Guilty as charged.  Once I read the description on the menu, I knew I had to try it.  It promised me freshly grilled veggies,  mushrooms and Havarti cheese on grilled foccacia.  The promise of yum.  Unfortunately, the sandwich didn't really deliver.  The positives:  it was large (enough for two meals) and served piping hot.  Unfortunately, I couldn't distinguish the flavor of any of the vegetables.  Everything just combined and it wasn't very tasty.  I think the mushrooms were overpowering.  Again, I get it.  This is not their specialty and I won't hold it against them, too much.  On a positive note, I like their fries.  They were served fresh with just the right amount of salt.  Service was fairly friendly.  The drive-thru is efficient although I got a very confused server who kept trying to deliver the wrong order to my car. Bottom line:  I am game to try it again, when I'm in the mood for a hot dog.",

I expect the quality and flavor of the beef to make or break the sandwich, and unfortunately, it broke the sandwich here. It was bland. Even with the cheese and extra sauce (and peppers), it tasted completely bland. I've had better roast beef from Boar's Head at my local grocer.   As others have noted, the fries were very salty, but the cheese helped diminish that. I was truly hoping for better, but I'm afraid I was completely let down. I'm staying at a hotel right across the street for the week, so I might give them another shot, but if I do, it will be a hot-dog, and not their Italian Beef, for sure.",

Portillos is definitely not the place to order a salad. The lettuce wasn't fresh and the dressing was more like water. Stick to the hot dogs which were really tasty!

    "text": "Virtual applause to you Portillo's for handling the masses so efficiently and smoothly! Word spread like wildfire when Portillo's announced that they were coming to Scottsdale. For months, Valley residents from all around waited anxiously for the doors to open. Just recently, Portillo's doors finally opened. Were they ready for the crowds? Yes they most definitely were!   I've been to Portillo's in Illinois so I knew what I was in for. This Portillo's lives up to its roots. The exterior is bright and welcoming with tables all around. The drive-thru resembles that of an In & Out (in the ordering sense) and the interior reminds me of a 1950's booming diner. Everything is friendly and welcoming about Portillo's, including the staff. I heard that they brought in around 80 Chicago staffers to manage the launch of the Scottsdale opening which was very smart on their part. We visited tonight and although the line was wrapped around the restaurant, we ordered our food and got it within 15 minutes. What's their secret? Complete organization. While we were waiting in line, someone came up and took our order so that by the time we got to the register, all we had to do was hand them our ticket and pay. After that, we got a number and waited for them to call it. Within 5-7 minutes, they called our number and we were ready to feast!   The food here is really as tasty as people say it is. It's all about the beef, the Italian beef that is. The beef is juicy, tender and flavorful and sits within a soft roll. The fries are delicious and the Chicago dogs are as good as any. I have yet to try the Chopped Salad or the milkshakes but I hear both are extraordinary so I will be ordering them next time.   All I can say is, believe the hype and pay a visit to Portillo's. It doesn't matter if you've been to one in Illinois or not. Now we have one in Scottsdale and Shea an the 101 is a better place because of it! Welcome to the Valley, Portillo's.",

Tried a hamburger, fries and onion rings too. The Jumbo dog was excellent. Juicy without being greasy and I like the Chicago style fixins too.  The hamburger was great. Not a toasted bun, but everything else was perfect.  The Fries are awesome. Soft on the inside, crispy on the outside.  Onion rings were a disappointment in my opinion. Batter to Onion ratio is to high for \"my\" liking. I will be back.",

    "text": "Like many other misplaced Chicagoland natives who somehow settled in the valley, the little things are what I miss the most.  One of those little things are the amazing hot dog and italian beef restaurants all over the city and its sprawling suburbs.  Portillo's not only was one of my favorite of those places, but it was the one that my brother and I would ride our bikes over to so we could get a cheap and delicious lunch before hitting up a movie on a random summer afternoon.  With that kind of nostalgic expectations, Portillo's in Scottsdale had a lot to live up to, and guess what?  They hit the mark with a perfect bullseye.  A jumbo hot dog with everything on it (like a good Chicago place even an Arizona Portillo's knows that means no ketchup unless specifically requested), fries, and a piece of chocolate cake!  The 10 year old me, who ate this meal more times than I can even try to remember, couldn't have been any happier.  The dog is pretty much what I remember loving as a kid.  The bun was a lot soggier than it should be, which resulted in the very fresh condiments falling out, but I can forgive that.  The fries were the perfectly crispy \"crinkly\" fries that the best places always served.  The cake was perfectly moist and scrumptious with the very sweet [and unnecessarily too much] frosting that I couldn't get enough of as a child.  My fiance had the italian beef.  Awesome.  Make sure to order it dipped.  Messy but flavorful.  She also ordered cheese fries (they just give you a container of some cheese sauce that I couldn't stop dipping my fries into).  By the way; the food is cheap!  All that and two soft drinks was only a little more than $20.00.  The line out the door was expected, and even a little daunting, at 6:30 on the Friday night following the grand opening.  The good news; It moved fast.  We got our food and found a table in a little over a half hour.  If that can be done in the first week, then the pace will certainly speed up when the excitement starts to ware down.  If you're not already a Portillo's fan, you may want to wait a few weeks for the hype to die down before you give the place a try.  It's not like there was a shortage of Chicago hot dog and italian beef places around the valley.  But Portillo's is certainly a top notch addition.",

A cute eatery with old time posters hanging up along with other things.  I tried the Chipotle BBQ salad with chicken and my friend had the chopped salad.  You order, they call your number and you pick up your food.  Service was quick and placed in trays where food would not slide around.  Indents in the tray held the salad, dressing and drinks in place.  Genius.  The salad was fresh and slightly spicy.  It comes with a roll, butter and house salad on the side.  I liked that the menu gave the guest the calories associated with the meal.  Food was good and filling.  We took home leftovers.  Reasonable prices.",

Served in a paper wrapper that basically had all the chilli squeezed from the bun. Was everywhere! I was almost not going to eat it as it looked terrible.  The buns were either microwaved or steamed, but they were extremely soggy! The onions rings however were nice - cooked perfectly! Crunchy and tasty! Can't get these wrong I guess when you deep fry right?  Disappointing that the staff take no pride in how they present their food (hot dogs) to the paying customer!

The best part of the burger was the crispy lettuce. The onion rings were greasy. The Italian sandwich was actually seasoned only way too seasoned that it was too salty to eat. The spaghetti tasted like canned tomato sauce warmed then poured over pasta noodles. The noodles were bland no seasoning @all my 10 year old took 2 bites and refused to eat anything after that. The meatball tasted like something out of the pre-packaged frozen aisle. We won't be coming back. With all the food ordered but not eaten we tossed the barely touched food and left hungry.",

I'm only giving it a 4 star because the lady at the desserts always  ignores me  she is to busy with her co workers talking to wait on me so therefore I have to wait and wait and wait",

The sandwich was excellent, but I was doubly impressed by the shift lead working behind the counter.   It took a little time for my food to come out but I was okay with it, but Dom apologized for the wait and treated me to a piece of their strawberry cake.  Not only was the cake terrific, but I was truly impressed by Dom's gesture.  I wasn't complaining or upset, yet he did the right thing from a customer service perspective.    Excellent job Dom, I look forward to seeing again next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "In Chicago, where Italian Beef sandwiches were born, Portillo's is an icon. My experience at this location in Scottsdale did not disapoint. The experience starts when you walk in the door and are welcomed by a very inviting interior decor.  The walls are covered in memorabilia and celebrity pictures. The staff is very friendly. The food is served quickly.  And of course, the food is delicious. My son and I had the Italian Beef. My son had it regular while I had mine dipped. Mine was a little more sloppy than I remembered, but delicious all the same. The fries were the same crinkle cut fries that I remembered. I wish we had a Portillo's in the Dallas area where I am from, but finding this one in Scottsdale helped bring back the memories of living in Chicago's suburbs and going to the original Portillo's Hot Dog stand in Villa Park, Illinois. Scottsdale, you are lucky!",

Wanted to see if I just had an off-meal...I didn't...I still hate it.  I ordered one of the popular beef sandwiches called the \"combo\" and ordered it \"dipped\" - which makes it WAY too soggy. I took a few bites and couldn't even bother finishing it.  Also had the apple walnut chicken salad for $7.79. It was alright at best but reminds me of a salad you eat on the airplane. And worth maybe $4. Cheap ingredients that aren't satisfying.  I know it's a part of the \"Chicago appeal\" but everything is too rush in there - even on a Sunday. There was no one in line but the cashiers are waving their arms to come to them to order when I'm still trying to look at my menu options. 4x in maybe 20 seconds someone was  waving me down even though I was right in front of them. It's overkill. Even sitting down I think the customers are worked up from the rushing because everyone is acting anxious. So not relaxing. I'm just trying to eat lunch - it's not that serious.  I won't be returning.",

I checked out the grand opening, and after a solid wait in line (I'll post pics), I enjoyed some of the best food in Chicago right here in Arizona! I'm completely stoked that Dick decided to open a couple of locations here.   On the menu for me during their first day was an Italian beef, with hot and sweet peppers, and cheese fries. Their beef is now the leader of the pack in AZ. You'll be hard-pressed to find a better one out here. It's juicy, it's savory, and it's a bit messy (I had that beautiful staff dip mine to really exemplify that latter description). As for the fries, they're perfecto...just like home, and they're even better with a cup of ooey gooey cheese sauce.  If you know me, you know I'm from Chicago. That said, I have to implore that you eat here if you're curious about real Chicago food. Portillo's nailed it in Chi, and they brought their best to the West for your enjoyment! Now all we need is a solid Chicago-style pizza joint to come this way... I'm looking at you, Lou.",

Do it the right way and get your italian beef soaked in the gravy for a few seconds. I like it with the hot peppers and the mozz along with a spicy italian sausage.

The place is huge, with an enormous amount of signage and colorful decor.  Ton's of tables, and lots of people helping.  The lines here were long, but I didn't spend more then 15 minutes between the time I stood in line and got my food.  they have two lines here. One for ordering, one for food pickup.  They had all 4 registers open, with girls throughout the line taking your order and writing it down for you to make things go quicker.  Once I got to the register, things went fine.  They sent me over to the pickup line where you grab your drinks and food.  That was the longer line of the two, and you kind of stand around in this clustered area waiting for your number to be called.  Being that this place was packed, there was an enormous amount of people waiting, but it seemed to go by quickly.  I found a seat near the door, and the food was awesome!  I got the jumbo hot dog with relish, mustard and onions with a pickle on the side. Bun was tasty, and I loved it. Price point was right on, and I will gladly drive the few extra miles to go here in the future.  If you haven't gone to Portillo's, you must do so!! Tasty!!  They also have a drive thru here, so if you want to avoid the crowds, or are in a hurry, this is the way to go.  Outdoor seating is available, along with ample parking in a very busy shopping center. Place is visible from the road, but come early because the place is non stop busy!!",

There are always crowds and long lines here, but don't let that discourage you, they really do go fast. From the items I've had I would recommend the Italian beef sandwich, the cheese fries and the chocolate cake shake. Not so much the chili cheese fries, or the croissant beef sandwich- they were OK, but I think the portions are on the smaller side, and the meat lacks some flavor. But don't get me wrong, its good grub and all. Its just all the crazy hype holds it up too high, and its hard to meet those expectations.

The many years AZ has been without Portillos have been very sad years.  You absolutely have to go check it out if youve never experienced it.

    "text": "Just wanted to give MAJOR PROPS to the Portillo's Staff on their Grand Opening!  They did an amazing job to make sure things ran efficient and people got their food.  It was a bright move for the Management to not let people reserve seats until they got their food.  By doing so, it allowed everyone to have a chance to find an open seat and enjoy their meal.    The turnout for this Grand Opening was unreal.  The line was long and continued to grow throughout the night.  I got in line at around 5pm with maybe 100+ people in front of me.  My wife joined me in line 15 minutes later and I only moved maybe 20 ft.  It took about 1 hour 30 min to get our food but we had no complaints.  The line moved fairly quickly for the amount of people that were there.  There was a good control of the line, didn't notice anyone cutting or anything.    Now onto the reason why we went there.  Since it was our first time at Portillo's, the wife and I decided to try out a few things.  We got the Hot Dog with everything on it, the Jumbo Chili Cheese Dog, Italian Beef with sweet peppers and mozarella cheese, large fries, and a Large Chocolate Cake Shake.  Everything was delicious!!  Between the two hot dogs, I enjoyed the regular hot dog with everything on it instead.  The Italian beef was amazing. I will ask for gravy on the side the next time I go so I can dip my sandwich in it.  The chocolate cake shake was like heaven in your mouth.  It was that good.  I think getting a large of that is just too much sweets for even two people.  I would get a smaller size the next time.  It was a great experience to be there on the Grand Opening day.  We will definitely be going back on our cheat days!",

    "text": "This place is pretty cool!  I liked it so much we went twice in one weekend.  I can't think of another restaurant that is as unique as Portillo's.    The building looks like a diner out of the 50's.  Inside, the place is decorated in a super cute way with lots of interesting signs.  They play oldies music and have ample seating.  Outdoor seating is available too and they have umbrellas to keep you cool and heaters outside to keep you warm.  Ordering is quick and the pricing is very fair!  What I really loved about Portillo's was the Italian Beef sandwich with mozzarella.  OMG, THE BEST BEEF SANDWICH IN TOWN.  They put what they call gravy (I call au jus) on the bread and it makes the bread it so soft.  I ordered cheese fries and the fries are crinkle fries with a cup of cheese on the side.  Very tasty!  We had the onion rings too and they were a little hard but still good.  They have great hot dogs, so says my husband.  Will have to try them at some point.  The have the best Italian Strawberry Shortcake I have ever had....okay technically it is my first \"Italian\" strawberry shortcake.  I have had lots of strawberry shortcake in my day and this was the best.  They sell a portion big enough for 2 for a little over $4.00.  Definitely a new favorite spot of mine!",

Yes, it is a beautiful place but something happened to the quality of the beef and lack of flavor. I ordered a beef sandwich with sweet and hot peppers, wet. I was set back being charged $1.00 extra for giardinara but I like it. Sadly 1 tablespoon combined of hot and sweet peppers is not worth a buck, this should be part of the sandwich as",

    "text": "I'm in love!  Finally a real piece of where I grew-up, Cook County, Illinois.  Portillo's is the  quintessential hot dog restaurant, Chicago Style if you like. A huge menu and a large facility in retro 50's-60's style with a Chicago theme.  Hours as of opening day are: Mon-Thurs 10:00am -10:30pm, Fri-Sat 10:00am-11pm. Sunday 10:30am -10pm. Closed: Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas. See store photos for the image these hours came from.  For dine-in or carry-out the process is the same. Get in line, order (probably should research online ahead of time so you know what you want before you get to the register, because the lines may be long). Then slide down to your left and wait for the number from your receipt to be called to pick up your order. While waiting stock-up on condiments and napkins or save a table inside or out.  There's several restaurants in one at this place, one for salads, one for sandwiches, and another for desserts. One order gets all three.  Their Italian beef in a roll is legendary, the preferred style is 'dipped' with hot peppers added (no, they're not too hot) There are two choices of sizes. I cannot do the larger one.  I tried ordering beef for carry out or dine-in to compare how the roll stood up compared to the 15 minute drive home and re-nuking vs eating there. The difference was minor, so it is okay to eat a beef at home. Same with their dogs.  Oddly enough for a guy who grew up in the suburbs of Chicago this is the first Portillo's I actually went inside. I've always been to the drive thru's before. The inside is designed to handle a large crowd and long lines.  This may turn out to be the anchor store in the mall where this place is located.   Traffic is a bit of a problem. Getting in is easy, getting out is not easy. I think most people try to exit the mall by driving south past the stores to near the Fry's then head east towards 90th St, then turn left onto 90th St and back to Shea if you live west of Portillo's. Be careful, the intersections of Shea at 90th and 92nd are among the highest crash rate locations in the phoenix metro area.  It may be safest to exit onto Shea heading east then make a left after several blocks and turn around back west when it's safe. Better to go the wrong way for a while than to risk fast turns in heavy traffic near the restaurant. Please be patient and allow lots of extra time for the drive back home.  The volume of business and the traffic around Portillo's now is probably not suited to those rude people from New York City.  The location for the marker on the map on Yelp is the wrong spot. If approaching from the west on Shea or from the Loop 101, exit to Shea Blvd heading east, stay in the far right lane and take the first driveway east of the highway to exit to the right heading south. This new restaurant does not show up on google maps or street-view. Yet.  I am speculating that Dick Portillo must be buying a place to winter here in Scottsdale which will keep this location on it's toes!  Update: During week #2, still has lines out the front door. There is a reason why.",

    "text": "I was so happy to see that another Chicago favorite was coming to Phoenix. Whenever I was back in Chicago I always made it a point to stop at Portillo's and get my fix. Chopped Salad, Hot Dogs, Italian Beef, everything on the menu is great.  We first tried this location on the Sunday after they opened. I figured the craziness and long lines would have died down by then. Boy was I wrong. The line was out the door and the drive-thru was packed. We opted for the drive-thru and it took about 45 minutes. It was so good I would have waited longer!  Since then we've been back several times and will continue to go back. It's just that good. No, Portillo's is GREAT!  If you're ordering the hot dog, get with everything including the hot peppers. Want to try an Italian Beef? Order it dipped with Sweet Peppers you won't be sorry. The Chopped Salad is another one of my favorites, but if you're ordering it to go ask them to toss it. Otherwise the dressing is on the side and it's not as good. If you have a meeting or a hot date ask them to leave the onions out of the Chopped Salad. It takes away a little of the flavor, but your date, partner, spouse or significant other will thank you.  Oh, and if you feel like indulging give the Chocolate Cake Shake a try. It's wonderful, but just don't have too many or you'll have to hit the gym for twice as long every day.  Gotta go now. Writing this review made me hungry for a Chopped Salad.",

See Ted's for a similar priced dog that will blow your mind, or The Main Ingredient Ale House for a top notch \"fancy\" dog.  The beef sandwich is fine, but it's not something to bring me back.  It's kind of fun having a sogged sandwich disintegrate in your mouth like bread thrown to ducks.  But it's also kind of like eating duck-grade bread.  The gravy/jus is flavorful but the meat isn't anything special.  Tender and well prepared but not much to it.  Compared to a good cheesesteak, the beef sandwich lacks character.   Poor onion rings.  Crunchy, yes, but they were all coating, no onion.  Good price to value ratio.  Neat restaurant interior, but it's a zoo.  Friendly staff, fast service at 8PM on a weeknight.",

There are many other choices to find a good hot dog. Today I tried the beef sandwich. I will start with the ordering part of the meal. Behind the register I encountered a person who either hated her job or just didn't care about customer service. A smile might have helped, but apparently that is not a job requirement. I ordered two large beef sandwiches. In a very disinterested voice I was asked if I wanted peppers on the sandwich. I ventured to ask what came on the sandwich and was told in a very bored voice, \"beef, there are charges for anything you want to add\". She then just stood there looking at me. I added the peppers and was given a number and a receipt. Thank you probably would have been an additional charge. The sandwiches were OK. They had a decent amount of meat, although one had a large chunk of gristle in the first bite. With the lack of customer service and the very average food, there is no reason to return.",

If you want a good burger avoid  In N Out burgers which are dull and overrated, go to Fat Burger, Greasewood Flats, or San Tan Flats instead.    Portillo's offers an amazing Chicago style beef sandwiches (although in Chicago Mr. Beef's and Al's are better).  We miss good beef sandwiches, great pizza, great hot dogs.  We're tired of Mexican restaurants which are a dime a dozen.  The only REALLY great Mexican restaurant in the area is The Barrios on 16th and Thomas.",

Their regular hot dogs were probably the cheapest quality dog I've ever eaten, it was rubbery and had that \"boiled hot dog\" taste. Their buns were super low grade as well. The polish dog was the only one that was grilled and had good flavor but the bun wasn't great quality either. For a place geared towards good hot dogs, i feel like they can get better quality meat and buns and grill it rather than boil it.",

    "text": "ATMOSPHERE  I went to this place a couple of times when they were another restaurant and wasn't prepared for the huge change in look inside.  I'm not impressed by theme restaurants and in fact, would rather avoid them but Portillo's \"theme\" is more like a neighborhood.  I like it.  It makes me feel like I'm part of eating with a lot of other people but not like they're sitting right on top of me.  I'm sure they didn't have a lot of choice when they remodeled the building but the drive through is plain weird ... you have to cross the drive through lane to get to the restaurant's front door from the parking lot and I'm surprised as many people make it alive as they do.  It's not customer friendly. Neither is the small outdoor dining area which happens to be right next to said drive through lane ... \"excuse me, would you like fries with your carbon monoxide fumes\"?  CUSTOMER SERVICE  Sad to say the only person who cracked a smile and said a word was the young lady whose job is to clean the tables, and it's not her job to talk to customers.  The worst was the ONE person who should be the friendliest and most helpful, the girl who took our order. She was bored silly and showed it. I know she meets a thousand people a day, but that's her job. If it's your first time in a restaurant you will have questions and don't immediately know what you should order ... you don't need a sigh and a bad attitude to make it more unpleasant.  FOOD  I cheated before I took this test (I used to live in Chicago in my college days and used to eat at The Dog House).  I know Portillo's well and I also know that no matter what the history of a place is, once they franchise and expand they become a chain with a name.  Don't expect this to be the same as your distant memories or the original Portillo's locations in Chicago but that being said, the Italian Beef sandwich I had (just beef and extra wet) was better than average, but maybe just a little bland.  Caution - some people get weirded out if their sandwich bread is soaking wet, it's an acquired taste.  Just trust me, it's supposed to be that way.  PRICE  Here's where Portillo's wins big time.  I'm still stinging from a few weeks ago when I paid over $8 bucks for a burger and \"value\" drink at Burger King.  They're not alone either, all of the big chain fast food places have suddenly gone off the deep end on price, even a basic Big Mac with value drink is over $5 bucks.  PS: I rarely go to those places anyway and they now have done an EXCELLENT job telling me they never want me as their customer again, hence finding places like Portillo's where I can eat real food in a nice sit-down restaurant and walk out paying less that at the kiddie places is a singular thrill.  I would rate them 4 stars but it's getting so hard to find places with decent food at reasonable prices anymore so (unless they do something stupid like raise their prices) I'll give them that extra star based on being an excellent value.",

    "text": "Being from Chicago, Portillos has been a family favorite for years and years. Thankfully, this location doesn't disappoint! Obviously not quite the same as Portillos in Chicago, but still pretty awesome.  I love the old-timey feel of Portillos, totally makes the experience of dining here better. The staff is always friendly too, I have only had fantastic service here, they have never disappointed. Being a vegetarian, I can't really comment on all of the things they are known for..but my family loves the different meat dishes they have to offer. I usually go for the veggie sandwich or a salad. When I went the other week I got a Mediterranean salad with no chicken and it was delicious! A little too much dressing, but otherwise really good. Came with soft tasty bread too, yum! Of course we always get the French fries too every time we come, that crinkle cut is soo good! Not too crispy, not too mushy, just right. The fact that this place is usually quite busy says a lot, it is awesome!",

In Chi-town there is a few legendary staples that make it what it is. The Mob, bad sports fans & Portillos. I decided to get a couple of the signature items. First the Itallian Beef, not the extra beefy Itallian beef because I'm not big and fat like a Bears fan.  It was juicy on a delicious bun. The sweet and hot peppers made it perfect.  I also got the Chicago style hotdog.  First of all why do they put all that stuff on it?  Oh wait, look at the size of Bears fans.  Reguardless it's delicious. I only had one.  I would recommed more than one to any Cubs fan so they can shut the F up about winning the World Series for 5 minutes. I normally get burgers there and I highly recommend them along with the fries.  I give this Portillos 5 hotdogs in the bun at the Bath House.",

This place has got one huge menu of choices which usually I'd frown upon but this place seems to be doing pretty good.  I had their char-grilled italian sausage and it was darn yummy.  GOt it with gianderia which are pickled hot veggies.  They weren't as spicy as I like but it was still good.  But there was something about the sausage that was yummy.  Their bread was perfectly crusty and homemade.  I think they lightly dip the bread in the drippings just enough to really flavor it.  It tasted buttery good.  My bf got the same thing and a chicago hot dog.  He said the sausage was so much better.  Made me glad I wasn't missing out on the hot dog :). For you vegetarians, they had options for you too.  THere is a veggie sandwich which looked really good.  They've got salads here too.  Overall, pretty good first experience.  But darn crowded and we came on a Monday out of all days!",

    "text": "I never went to Portillo's when I visited Chicago, but I had to jump on the band wagon when I saw practically all of Phoenix metro teem with anticipation for its grand opening on 90th and Shea. The line was out the door when we arrived last Sunday afternoon, but it moved quite swiftly, which gave me just enough time to study the menu. My friend and I shared the CHAR-GRILLED MAXWELL STREET STYLE POLISH, ITALIAN BEEF, CHOPPED SALAD, and CHEESE FRIES. The polish was good - it had all the \"Chicagoan fixings,\" and it popped (with an audible sound) when I bit into it, which is a huge plus in my book. Probably my favorite item from the meal. I found the Italian beef a little dry. I'm no connoisseur, but I personally like Luke's Italian beef better. It has more flavor, more kick, and probably more calories too. Maybe I should have gotten it with \"extra gravy\"? That could have been an error on my part, so I won't hold it against the restaurant. Cheese fries were delicious, but I'm very easy to please when it comes to fried potatoes, especially when it's crinkled and served with Cheez Whiz. Finally, the salad was a little \"wet\" for my liking, but very flavorful nonetheless. Not sure if it's worth the price (seemed a little high against the rest of the fare) but  a little green after all that felt right and warranted. When the buzz dies down a bit, I think this would be the perfect place for \"a la carte\" snacking, or grabbing a quick lunch salad. Great for light-hearted family outings, too, I suppose. My friends have raved about their ribs, so I'm hoping they will be available on the Arizona menu one day. Withholding the fifth star for the \"could be improved\" soda refill system - I personally don't care, but I saw many people waiting a long time to get one.",

I am not a huge fan of hot dogs so I opted for the Italian beef.  I suggest ordering it with hot peppers and mozzarella.  It's soo good.  I literally crave it.  The drive-thru is very efficient and probably quicker than inside during peak hours.  My only suggestion is that if you get it to go the cheese may make the bread soggy so keep that in mind! The fries are good and so are the onion rings but you will not need them, the sandwich is huge!  If you are planning to dine in during meal times, I suggest you either are not in a hurry or go a little before or after the traditional times for lunch or dinner.  The lines move quickly though so do not let them scare you off.",

    "text": "Portillo's is here!!!  I am from Naperville IL originally and it's great to have Portillos here in AZ. I stayed away the first day, but heard they served 10,000 people in 12 hours, wow.  I also heard it was the biggest grand opening of any Portillo's ever!  I am not surprised.  Did you know Phoenix Metro has more Chi-town transplants than any other city? It's estimated there are over 700,000. Shocking!  Actually, not really. Chi-town is a great city, but the weather is horrendous. Now Portillos is here and we can all rejoice and occasionally sneak over for a Beef n Cheddar, Hot Dog or maybe even a Chocolate Cake Shake (watch the calories on that one). Anyway, their salads are really great too, so everything in moderation right?  Portillo's prices are very reasonable. The beef sandwiches and hot dogs are all family priced and the food is always made up fresh while you wait. The drive thru system isn't the best, but it's fast.  I just would prefer to be able to see the menu before you reach the mobile order takers, but your best bet is to ask for a takeout menu and go home and do your research so you know what you want before you drive thru because you will never have time to see the menu board. lol.    Here's more great news, Portillo's is opening another location at Tempe Marketplace this summer (under construction now) and almost ready to announce a Chandler location as well. I also hear there will be at LEAST 3 more stores, one in North Phoenix (Desert Ridge anybody?), one by I-17, another over by Arrowhead Mall and the new Estrella Falls Mall in Goodyear. I am sure they will all do great.  As Dick Portillos says, \"we call Phoenix the west suburbs\" because there are so many Chicagoans out here.  Not  too mention for vacations, spring training and snowbirds.  So Portillos, welcome to Phoenix, we are happy you are here and can't wait to see more of you!  By the way, I agree with the poster down below, we need a few more tastes of home, specifically Chicago Style Pizza and Lou Malnati's would fit the bill perfectly. Come on Lou, come to beautiful AZ with your tasty Chi-Town Buttery Crusted Pizza.",

I chose to go to the drive thru it's always busy too , The place was jammin on a Saturday afternoon.  The young girl at the drive thru greeted me, I mentioned that I had never been here before what did she recommend? She said they were famous for their Chicago Beef sandwiches and of course the Hot Dogs. I wasn't feeling too risky so I chose a hot dog and french fries with a coke. I waited till I got home to dig in.  Well now I know what all the HOOPLA'S about! Best darn hot dog and fries I've ever had!! The french fries are amazing. It's been a week and I'm still thinking about them. (I may have to join a 12 step program because of those fries, so GOOD) Hot Dog was delish. Juicy , hot , and perfect condiments. I shared the fries with a friend, she too enjoyed them as much as I had, in fact she couldn't stop thinking about them either so she stopped in a few days later to get her Portillo's Fix!  Oh and one more thing, they serve the soft drinks in Styrofoam which I love, it keeps your drink super cold and prevents the ice from melting.

An 'usher', or whatever they are, jettisoned us (rather rudely also I must say) into the line saying we have to get in line, despite our remarks that we had never been here and didnt know what to order. He insisted so we got in line and within 30 seconds were pushed to the counter. We still had almost no time to look at the menu and we let the employee know that we were pushed through and we weren't ready and then he got frustrated with us. Felt like I was in the twilight zone. Hot dogs are sub-par and disappointing. Luke's of chicago was way better in my opinion. Not allowed to sit at a table and wait unless you have food, must clean up your own plates and throw everything away your self. Not really much a restaurant format. Wonder exactly what I am paying for here; average food and attitude it seems. Gave them 2 more tries and results were similar. Not coming back here.",

    "text": "Portillo's is relatively new to the Valley and was slammed for the first two weeks it was open, making getting in a challenge, but well worth it.  These have to be the best hot dogs I have ever eaten in my life!  And the Italian beef sandwiches are amazing.  I had never had one before Portillo's and I wanted to see if they were as good as the pictures.  I was not disappointed in the least.  Add the sweet peppers folks, for a real treat.  The chicken sandwiches are excellent, but a chicken sandwich you can get anywhere.  Stay with the Italian beef and the great hot dogs and you cannot go wrong.  Then after, take a look at dessert.  Not an array of choices, but what they have cannot be beat:  strawberry shortcake or luscious chocolate layer cake.  It's hard to walk out without getting that strawberry shortcake!  Listen for you number and be entertained by the playful way they announce it.  \"Number 8, no more wait!\"  or \"Number 11, come get your piece of heaven!\"",

    "text": "The place is packed. Disorganization is rampant. The hot dogs were tasteless and cold.I honestly think they forgot to cook the hot dog as it was COLD~ not room temperature! ( I was nauseous later that day.)  They had another order mixed with ours so we had extra which we threw out. .Total chaos inside. There are several lines for ordering food, paying the cashier and then everyone waits for the order to be called. It is like a cattle call. There is no orderly flow from one to another. People have to push there way through in order to pick up their order which bottle necks at one point   I can not understand the hype.Positively there is not much to say except they have interesting   menus and atmosphere (signage etc). . In summary, this place has built up an image from its past. Can people be so desperate to wait for mediocre food, crowded conditions and total chaos?  Perhaps not all Portillos are run the same? I would skip this joint. I give it an \"F!\" Unless they clean up their act, I honestly don't see how this place can make it in the long run. I don't think Scottsdale people will in the long run tolerate this substandard establishment. I tried it out of curiosity and hype. Once was plenty. Thank goodness for alka seltzer! Argh!",

The staff did a great job of getting everyone to the right place and keep the flow or ordering moving forward - second star.  We ordered two chili cheese dogs, one fry, one onion ring, and drinks.  The hot dogs themselves were decent - more of a half star.  Then no more stars.  The chili was runny and had no flavor and we struggled to find the cheese.  The o-rings and fries were also not remarkable at all.  The availability of condiments is None.  When we picked up the order from the counter we asked for mustard and three packets of yellow mustard where thrown on our tray.  I asked if they had any other types of mustard and the lady looked me as if I was crazy and said \" No.\"  \"Ok\", I replied,  taken back by her manner.  She then said \"What were you expecting?\"  My reply \"Oh, maybe something other than we can get at Sonic.\"  If you have kids and want something fast and hot, it's the place to go. I'm sure they will have a lot of lunch business from the hospital.  We will not be back.",

My dad kept raving about this place so i finally went with him to see what he has been talking about for the past 5 months. I ordered the Roast beef sandwich with mozzarella cheese and hot peppers with a coke. IT WAS SO GOOD! The roast beef was cut perfectly and tasted amazing! The bread was crispy on the outside but the inside had absorbed all that roast beef juice and flavor! This was like heaven to my lips! It brought back those heavenly flavors and memories of when I was a fat kid visiting my grandparents and eating roast beef sandwiches for dinner! I now see what my dad was telling me about!  I found my new favorite place in Scottsdale! The place itself reminded me of New York, New Jersey, or Chicago and they were very quick to make the order. This place is great for when I am craving those foods I usually get back east.",

I was there on opening day and I'm back today with my family introducing them to all that is great about Chicago except.........it wasn't a good experience.  Here is what was wrong:  - Cheese sauce was burnt.  You couldn't see it looking at it but you could certainly taste it.  Very disappointing.  - My wife ordered a sprite and they attempted to give her a Coke and eventually gave her a cup of Soda Water.  I would have gone back but given the line, why bother?  I love you Portillo's and I will certainly give you another shot but please make sure the standards are being met!",

    "text": "As a kid, I would often travel to Chicago to visit my grandparents. One of my big treats every time I went was a visit to Portillo's for one of their famous Chicago dogs or Italian beef sandwiches. As I got older, I no longer had a reason to travel to Chicago and was missing my Portillo's. Lo and behold, this Portillo's opened up in Phoenix, not too far from where I now frequently vacation in the spring. I was so excited! So, my last trip down I stopped in. Everything was just how I remembered it. The decor and menu hadn't changed one bit. I ordered one of my old standbys--the Italian beef. That, too, had not changed: tender, shaved beef, dipped in flavorful gravy, on a soft roll, and of course topped with the ever-important giardiniera. Sheer perfection. They even offer a package to-go of their beef and gravy, enough for several Italian beef sandwiches. I love this stuff so much I figured out a way to get it all on the plane so I could have more of my beloved Portillo's at home in Seattle.   If you're a Chicago transplant, or otherwise just LOVE Chicago-style food like me, this is your place. I will definitely be back!",

The Italian beef with hot peppers was very tasty on a nice Italian roll.  daughter had beef & cheddar on a croissant which was tasty as well. We got the gravy on the side...nice to dip as you go instead of dripping all over. Two sandwiches, side of fries, side of slaw, and one drink was about $17. Would like to go again and try some other choices!",

We were at the drive thru,  they have an extensive menu and it hasn't even been 2 minutes when the lady started rushing is to go complete the order at the window. I mean I didn't know it was required to already know what you want when you just pulled up to the menu st a drive thru.  The woman at the drive thru kept interrupting my husband saying \" I can't understand what you're saying, go to the window to order\" in a not so friendly manner.  My husband asked if he could have a second to look at the menu, she said go to the window. Needless to say we got to the window,  my husband asked for a menu since we were rushed through,  they don't have printed ones,  the guy said to go to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fportillos.com&s=3395c9d0cc6024f6b9f301c1d9ebe82dac1fde629abec0b2b184de15b08fd965\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">portillos.com</a> to see the menu. My husband said well I couldn't order because I was trying to look at the menu at the drive thru, but was rushed to the window. So the guy told us \"well you had seven cars behind you! \". Seriously? What type of lame excuse, if they don't want to have a line, don't  have a drive thru. Then the irony is they said Pull up and park and we'll take the food out to you. So I am expected to wait but they can't?! Ten minutes later we got our food, no napkins or anything. One star for food tasting good. Work on your drive thru manners.",

The Italian beef was filled with delicious beef and tasted especially good. The French fries are cheap and delicious. They were rightly seasoned and filled with flavor. The bathroom was clean and they had nice outdoor seating with a misting system. I will be coming back.",

The outside of the building was like most restaurants, but once inside I was pleasantly surprised to see how large and open it was. They were playing awesome diner type music, but way more fast paced and extremely busy. There are a couple signs directing you to the ordering counter, pick up and online orders. Once your order is taken you can find a table and wait for your number to be called. I ordered a Chicago dog and onion rings while my dad ordered fries and a chili dog. Once we received our food it looked great, but once we tasted it I was a bit bummed. It was hardly warm and the onion rings were flavorless. There was a great atmosphere and I'd come back to try a salad, burger or something else. Before we left we wanted to try their Italian strawberry shortcake. I went to the counter with the desserts and no one was there. There was another girl in front of me that seemed frustrated and said she'd been waiting for five minutes. Finally a employee came to get our orders and we had our dessert quickly. One cake was enough for us both to share and it was to die for! I don't know what they do to make it, but it was heavenly. I would've bought a few more to take home if I didn't live so far away.",

The burger had a nice char flavor and lots of condiments. Crinkle fries were crispy and potato-y. We shared a \"small\" chocolate malt, which was more than enough for the two of us. They also offer sandwiches, ribs, salads, and desserts.  It's not a destination restaurant, but if you're in the neighborhood and hungry, it's a solid bet for American classics at a very reasonable price.",

The bun was soft and delicious while the fries were crispy and well cooked.  Ordering is easy and if it's really busy you might want to stand at the counter because of the noise you can't hear your order number called out.

    "text": "Went for dinner last night with the wife, daughter and sister.  Been wanting to come here since they opened but wanted to wait til they slowed down.  What better time in Scottsdale but a muggy August night. Now this place started literally 3 miles where I grew up (Elmhurst, Il) so I new what to expect.  Really impressed by the wide open restaurant.  Food was as I remembered. The only complaint I have is if you order a salad it comes out in a totally different location then the rest of the deliciousness.  Where is the soda machine for refills?  Didn't want to go up and ask for a refill for 2 reasons: would have been disappointed if they said they charged and I was going home to drink Sierra Nevada. Also,they need to be more attentive to the restroom, no paper towels but they had an environmentally caring jet driven hand blower that got the job done.",

    "text": "I'm 100% biased on this one as I'm from Illinois. I could eat here everyday if cholesterol, blood sugar and morbid obesity were not a factor.  Their hotdogs are can't lose.  They serve Chicago dogs on a poppy seed bun.  I like mine with onion, pickle, celery salt and mustard; they almost always come out spot on. They have a million different options but that's how I've been eating them since I was a kid.  I will ocasionally switch it up and get a chili cheese dog with onions. The chili dogs are good but often hard to eat due to the massive amount of chili.  Anyway, they take you back to being in the city.  The big difference is the people in Arizona are much more friendly than in Chicago.  As previous posters have mentioned, their cheese fries are killer.  They are crinkle cut fries with what has to be an imitation cheese sauce but it is delicious. I would drink the sauce if my wife wouldn't judge me.   I can't recommend portillo's enough. The service is always great and it's hard to not leave full. Portillo's Italian beef is also very tasty, I recommend trying it with extra gravy, not dipped, and with hot peppers.",

I heard that they changed owners and I believe it now.  The quality of the whole business is down.  The food now is hit or miss.  I went on Monday, the 28th. The person who took my order was rude, seems like we were annoying her.  Ordered a beef, had to bring it back because the bun was extremely hard and wasn't even seasoned right. The hotdog wasn't even good and they are not Vienna, like another person wrote on a review. The worst of all were the restrooms. They were filthy. I had to tell someone about it.  Looks like I'll have to try another place serving food from Chicago.",

I took the jumbo cheese chili hot dog. It is served in cartboard, melted with paper. The size is around 3 inches. So i can t imagine the size of a regular hotdog...need probably a microscope to see it. No condiments available. Everything ws already shut down 30 minutes before the closure. Wanted 2 beers, the blond one. No more, of course. Everything is served in paper, no plates, just jumbo trays with 4 big holes, gokd if you have a swimming pool and 3 other friends, so you can share the tray. Oh, i forgot, my daughter took fries with cheese. Surprise, it comes with fries in a paper bag....and a container witb \"cheese melted\", doesnt taste cheese, more car oil. Disgusting. Any fast food put the cheese on the top of the fries and under the grill. It was probably 55f inside the place. So you better hurry to eat your \"food\" and go back home....if your survive to that experience. Don t go there, never, even with your best ennemy",

I don't even like hot dogs but the throngs of people flowing through the doors at noon piqued our curiosity. After some initial disorientation due to the over abundance of signage, we located a paper menu and were pleasantly surprised that most of the menu items were not hotdogs.   I ordered a broiled chicken sandwich and my husband  chose the Italian roast beef sandwich.  My sandwich was fabulous! The bun was super fresh and there was a moist real chicken breast with some lettuce and tomato on it. The Italian sandwich was loaded with meat which had been soaked in a flavourful au jus. The $5 prices seemed like a bargain for them.   The sides of fries and onion rings  were nothing special but the apple walnut chicken salad and the chocolate malt are on my list for our next visit.   Interestingly many of the employees seem to be a couple of generations older than your typical fast food kind of place and they are super friendly and efficient .",

Wow it is still pretty busy with lots of families everywhere enjoying themselves and having a tasty treat at the same time. I even saw several groups giving each other hugs with excitement as they gathered up together.  Both inside and out are very clean and well decorated with style. It is fun just going around and looking at all the cool items hanging on the wall. This place is oiled like a well tuned machine. Simply walk up and order, pay, then step to the side and pick up your food. You can watch them diligently working in the kitchen to get the orders to perfection. Cool!  Had to get a Jumbo Dog Chicago Style which is basically what they call everything. Also tried out the Beef and Cheddar on a Croissant with Sweet Peppers. The wife ordered an Italian Beef with Sweet Peppers and a large side of Cheese Fries to share.  The food was really tasty and fresh. I particularly liked the Dog which was created perfectly and had a great flavor profile. The Beef and Cheddar was also very tasty but seemed to be a little skimpy on the beef. The basic Fries and Cheese was hypnotically good. Maybe I'm just a sucker for that kinda cheesy goodness. They also have Burgers, Chicken Sandwiches, Salads, plus a whole lot more.  Nice place and I would definitely go back again. Would like to see the foot traffic for the order line go around the outside of the dinning area instead of cutting right through the middle and creating a criss cross of confusion for those eating, trying to get a napkin, or a refill. Maybe hiring a Feng shui Master to give it an adjustment. Reversing the kitchen would be too expensive at this point. LOL!  Grab a menu or study it before hand. A lot of people have a list of what they want already. Just remember - Go Cubbies & Da Bears!",

I'm an HVAC tech and rarely get sent out here to Scottsdale but when I do I used to always stop by for an Italian Beef with Mozz and sweet peppers . But my last 2 visits have been terrible first time I came it was busy lunch hour place was packed and I dined in I ordered an Italian beef w/ mozz and sweet peppers and a traditional hot dog . The Italian beef was like warm the cheese wasn't even close to melted and and I got an entire green bell pepper half just slapped on top . I was kind of in a hurry and thought ok they're busy I'll let it slide . Next I get to the hotdog and the bun was hard and stale and there was enough celery salt on it to choke a horse . Ok now I was angry so I throw down the dog I get up ready to complain and request a refund and my office calls with and emergency call . Ok I gotta go I'll let this visit slide I'll give em another shot next time . So today I waited till they were open for 5 minutes and I hit the drive thru I order an Italian beef same way as always . I'm really excited to stuff down my long anticipated Italian beef so I pull over in the parking lot to feast and bam there it is another jacked up Italian beef this time the meat was cold the cheese wasn't melted at all and again just a hunk of pepper . I'm furious , but instead of going back wasting more time and causing a scene I decided to leave this review . I'm not even so much mad as I am disappointed. I'm really upset that I now don't have a go to place for my Chicago fix . You guys really dropped the ball not once but twice and I can't go back for a round 3 . I'm sorry but you lost a customer, loyal customer I might add . Get your act together guys you used to be the best around",

It was strange to me, to see a Resturant MONTHS after opening, with drive through lines across the parking lot, and a VERY VERY full dining room.   We got in line, and I had no idea what I wanted, and didn't have much time to pick because someone with a bag and a pencil pressures you into ordering before you even get to a register. I understand they are trying to speed things up, but when I'm a first timer --- let me look at the menu.   I ended up ordering a Chili Dog.   It was great to have glass between us, and the kitchen. It was exciting to watch everything going on and MAN do they have a LOT of employees. Everything seemed to work like clock work.   I have also decieded my new dream job is to be the girl who calls out the order number!  Number Eight Seven, you're about to be in HEAVEN!  Very clever!   The food was delightful.  I really enjoyed my chili dog, and the french friends were hot and tasty.   I will be returning - but don't rush me!",

    "text": "I gave into the hype and met some girlfriends at Portillo's the other night for dinner...  Perhaps I had high expectations from both the Yelp reviews I'd read prior and all of my Chicago friends raving about this institution that they grew up frequenting.    Unfortunately, I didn't realize that a few weeks after the grand opening, Portillo's would still be a zoo!  It's huge and lines weren't long, so I can't complain about that, there were just tons of people (both patrons and employees) everywhere you turned.  I didn't love the layout either...  I'm usually all about fast casual concepts and ordering at a window, but I hated that there are three different areas to pick up your food.  It varies depending on if you order salads, hot food, and/or dessert.  And you have to wait for your number to be called and then go pick it up from the appropriate window.  It's hard enough to hear your number being called and then it's tough because you have to leave your group to go get your food; hence, not a relaxing start to a meal...  Amongst my group of three, we had a hotdog, a chicken sandwich (the breaded one on the croissant), a bowl of chilli, a barbecue chicken salad, and two large fries (one with cheese and one without).  We also had a lemonade and several bottles of water.    I will say that prices are very reasonable, and the food was fine -- not amazing though.  I felt like it was a glorified fast food restaurant; nothing to make me rush back, although I am sure I'll eventually make my way back to try some of the other things on the menu.  (The other salads looked good and I hear great things about their desserts).  Again, I wasn't a fan of all of the chaos -- perhaps that will die down eventually?  There were a ton of staff, but none of them were super friendly or helpful.  Guests are supposed to clear their own tables - we learned that when we asked.    Portillo's doesn't offer a kids' menu (although considering the prices, that's fine), and no refills on drinks either.  I think if you go in with expectations for a higher end McDonald's, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",

    "text": "Can I get a sweet jesus or even a hell ya!!! Best hot dog I have EVER had!!!  This place is super cute! I love the way it's set up, very open, fits a ton of people, cute little patio out front, they have a convenient drive through and have a great mix of old school/Chicago decor, set up in a modern way (if that makes any sense)  The menu is larger then I thought it would be there are salads, hamburgers, chicken sandwiches and of course hot dogs!! I decided to go with the Jumbo Chili Dog, Cheese fries and a drink! Wish I had room for dessert, or a chocolate shake! Definitely going to order that next time! A lot of places over cook hot dogs, or have awful tasting chili they pile on top. It's nice to actually get a perfectly cooked/juicy hot dog, on a delicious seasoned bun, with flavorful chili! Ohhh and the fries! I LOVE crinkle fries.... a lot of places stopped serving them! Portillos hit home with me with the crinkle fires! Nice and crispy, crunchy, the way crinkle fries should taste!  Overall great experience! This place is very laid back, casual, family and date friendly! The staff is very courteous and welcoming! Worth the lines and the kayos! I recommend going later at night around 9pm is when we went (I know that is late to eat) but there were no lines, received our food in about 5 minutes, sat and enjoyed each others company while people watching and took the long drive home!  This specific location is about and hour away from my house, but certainly worth the drive! I can't wait for them to open up their new location this summer at Tempe Market Place!  Great night! Thanks for finally making it to AZ Portillos!",

I made an earlier call to Portiilo's to confirm that they had a delivery service and that it serviced my location.  They assured me they had this available.  All I had to do is order on-line.  When it came to the actual ordering time, I got a response that either my location was out of their delivery area or there wasn't a driver available.....try again later.   I tried six times and even a call to the actual location without any acceptable results.   The location said they had nothing to do with the delivery service and left it like that -- poor answer, I thought.  Eventually, I had a good sandwich but had a very poor customer experience which I had to resolve without any help from Portillo's.   Portiilo's:  please decide whether or not you have a reputable delivery service.   If you can't do it, please don't say/advertise that you can.",

Ok, the review: On my first trip out in AZ saw there was a Portillo's by our hotel and decided to finally try it (the closest Portillo's to me is in OC, but why we haven't been yet - I dunno). I had the Italian Beef - Dipped - with sweet peppers. So much deliciousness in such messy sandwich - but I didn't care about the mess, my hunger and tastebuds were satisfied. My hubby had the chili dog but he ate it so fast I didn't get to try it, he must have enjoyed it. Extra points for having delicious crinklecut fries. But minus one star, because I decided to try the Tamale and it was disappointing - it had a gummy texture and the filling was pasty, sorry!! A must is the Strawberry Shortcake for dessert!   Well organized lines, and food pickup. Love that their trays have cup holders! Hoping all the other locations give me the same experience. The hype is real, now open one in San Diego please. I don't want to have to drive all the way to Orange County just to try the Portillo Chicago Dog that I didn't have room in my tummy for this time around.",

Way better than anything at Spaghetti Factory/Warehouse.  It takes me 2-4 times to finish all the spaghetti because I usually like to eat carbs in little snacks.  I also like the Beef Beef sandwich here with hot peppers.  The beef isn't seasoned very well and relies on the french dip (they call it gravy here and pre-soak the bread in it).  It's good but personally would prefer it not pre-soaked which makes it soggy.    The daily fresh bread that the sandwich is made from is very good.  The hamburgers here are a bit of a let down.",

    "text": "I need to explain a few things about this review. You see, I recently lost my mom, and a lot of the memories I have of her in the past few years involve this restaurant. What does that have to do with this place getting 5 stars? Everything.  Mom never liked going into Portillo's. It's busy, a little loud, and kind of hectic. It's a place where families take their kids, and she was in her 80's and getting around with a walker. So this became the place for the rest of us to go when Mom wasn't around.   Turns out she liked the food just fine, it was just the part about going there she didn't like. Fine, drive-thru it is. It's a very efficient drive-thru. If you come in during the rush they have a brigade to get the order in and cooking so you don't have to wait very long. It's also open late, which comes in handy.  So besides the delicious combo sandwich (Italian sausage & Italian beef), the salads, and everything else I've had there, my lasting memory will be my mother in the ICU across the street grabbing a Portillo's hot dog out of my sister's hand before my sister could unwrap it for her and began chowing down. She hated hospital food, and when we all decided to send her home to hospice the doctor said we could bring her whatever food she wanted. Portillo's was her pick.  Food is love and food brought her joy that day. We lost her several days later. But the look of joy when she bit into that hot dog after 4 days of being in the hospital? That's going to stick with me for awhile.",

    "text": "This place already has a plethora of reviews so mine really isn't needed but since I'm a hot dog fan I had to say something. The Chicago dog was amazing as expected, all the fixings on a steamed bun! The fries were underwhelming and needed more seasoning. The Chili Cheese Tamale was surprisingly good but you feel guilty with each bite ( I swear that thing has to be a million calories alone and only God knows what they are using as the filler!). The stand out thing here for me is the service. This place has excellent customer service, from the time you walk in till the time you walk out their employees make you feel at home and that's something I really cherish. In this day in age when most establishments are only concerned about your money, Portillo's goes the extra mile to make your overall experience great.",

    "text": "I've never had an Italian beef before my visit to Portillo's. I lived by one in California but I never tried it because I thought it was just hot dogs, but when I saw some of the pictures of the beef sandwiches and read the reviews, I was eager to give it a try. Since this location is right by my work, I finally had a convenient opportunity to give it a shot. We went through the drive-thru and service was crazy on point! It wasn't incredibly busy like I had seen passing by other times, so maybe the 7 staff members standing outside to take orders usually have more to do, but it seemed way overstaffed at that point. The food came out reasonably fast and you could feel the heat of the sandwich intensely through the bag. We decided to share a big beef sandwich, dipped (we love gravy) and with hot peppers, with a side of fries. The sandwich was so juicy it leaked through the bag, so next time ill probably ask them to double bag/wrap it! When we got home we devoured the entire meal with great satisfaction. The sandwich was huge, easily satisfying our hunger. Can't wait to have another, and maybe try a Chicago Style dog, I'm interested in what all the hype is about!",

This restaurant should be ashamed of itself for allowing their canned disgusting tamales to be served here, especially in AZ. Too crowded. Too pricey. Plenty of better restaurants in the area.",

I have been handed the wrong orders twice before my order and handed them back bags of food meant for other customers.  This might explain why on my most recent visit we waited over 20 minutes for our to go order.  Meanwhile bags of food were handed out to three different vehicles behind us.  I am sure one of those our order.  When we got our food it was hot and we made the 20 min drive home. We got home and the Hamburger with bacon and no mayo was a cheeseburger with mayo.  The cheeseburger with no mayo or tomatoes had plenty of both.  The Italian sausage with sweet peppers, hot peppers and grilled onions had only hot peppers.  Here is a tip.  If you pull up to the window and there is a plump rotund employee standing between your car and the window maybe the rotund guy should get outta the way or stick around to hand me my damn food.  Instead I had to get out of my car to grab my food when he needed to walk back to the first window to chat.  This place is probably way too overstaffed and just a mess.  Also why don't you you let me pull all the way up to the menu incase i want to order something different.  No i don't have the whole damn menu committed to memory.  Clearly your employees do not either.  I will not be going back here anymore.  It is just not worth the hassle.",

    "text": "Really not seeing the draw to this place. Visited yesterday on a recommendation from one of their staff members I met who seemed to have nothing but wonderful things to say about his employer's restaurant. Needless to say his opinion failed to meet my expectations.   First impressions are not everything. Make no mistake, the building itself is impeccably decorated. Inside and out are both done up really well. The place was absolutely jam packed with people too. At least 150 people were crammed into the premises, all seemingly enjoying the rush of the fast paced ordering service. And it's here that I have to hand it to them. With lines nearly out the door (and it's a long way from the registers to the exit), employees handled the crowd with ease. No hiccups. No rudeness. Perfect service. At this point it's safe to say I was impressed and excited to eat!   Unfortunately you just cannot rely on first impressions. The decor is a facade for what really is going on here. Only one word comes to mind when I now think of Portillo's: GIMMICK. The food here is nothing to write home about at all, or maybe it is, just not in the way you might think. The hot dogs I ordered were served in your typical Chicago style. Sesame seed bun, pickle, hot peppers, tomatoes, onions, and mustard. How could you go wrong? Right? Well they managed to... The bun was straight out of a cheap grocery brand bag. The hotdog tasted like an undercooked Bar S hotdog glazed with the dirty dollar bills Dick Portillo managed to swindle out of me. I could have easily made this at home for a fraction of the price and effort. Even the onion rings were from a low grade frozen grocery store brand. I know this because I often buy the exact same ones to eat at home, they are indistinguishable in both looks and taste. Terribly mediocre and good only for a quick frozen home meal.   Some people will gawk at my review and say \"Try the Italian beef. You'll change your mind.\" And to that I say \"My friend ordered the 'Italian' beef and cheese croissant with gravy. I took one bite and found myself only pushed further to disgust by this rip off of an establishment.\"   What a waste of time and money. I think it's safe to say Portillo's failed to gain a regular customer yesterday. I also think it's safe to say I won't be recommending this pace to anyone any time soon.   The only thing saving it from receiving a one star review is it's visual appeal and perfectly managed staff. So... kudos to you Dick Portillo for creating one of the largest privately owned food brands around! What a business plan you've crafted here too! Incredibly cheap ingredients and components sold at a premium... Wow... Can you say profits?! I'd love to own the place for a week. A privately owned chain with an owner who's story defines the \"American Dream\" and basing out of a city famous for this style of food... Sounds good on paper but ,take heed, only one word can describe Portillo's: gimmick.",

It's not that hard to let the water drip off of a hot dog before you put it on the bun. That's really starting to annoy me, so 4 stars. The staff is always wonderful. We have eaten a few of the sandwiches, which are good. The chicken chopped salad is our favorite, but I don't think the chicken is cooked in-house. Lately the chicken in the salad has been mushy and covered in fat, so we ask for the chicken on the side so we can pick through it. We love It here, but it needs some attention to detail. P.S. A Chicago dog comes with celery salt. All employees should be reminded of this.",

    "text": "I've driven by the Portillo's in Tempe many times and have wanted to try it.  Today I noticed a Portillo's has very recently opened near my house in Scottsdale.  As I was already at Barnes & Noble, I walked over to give it a try.  And like the March Madness games currently on television, Portillo's Hot Dogs is \"one and done.\"  I will not be returning due to many reasons.  (1) The place is called \"Portillo's Hot Dogs.\"  Therefore, I ordered their signature menu item, their beef hot dog with everything on it.  When I got my paper bag of food, there at the bottom under my fries was the smallest hot dog I've seen in a soggy bun that was squished from being wrapped up tightly.  It brought back memories of the 1970s commercial \"Where's the beef?\"  Really, the hot dogs at the Diamondbacks' baseball games are a higher quality and that's a very low standard.  The circumference of the hot dog was smaller than a dime.  It's that small.  And for being their signature menu item, my expectation was for a quality hot dog that was plump and juicy.  Maybe their signature item is actually a kids' hot dog???  They should provide a bigger hot dog in a more appealing manner.  (2) The place is loud.  It just gave me a headache to have to listen to a constant barrage of \"Order Number 240.  Order Number 236.  Order ...\" constantly blaring over the speakers.  Seriously, come up with a better, less obnoxious way to match people with their food.  (3) The whole eating experience has the feeling of disorganized hurry mode.  The whole process of ordering to picking up the food is disorganized.  Perhaps they should slow down a bit and actually listen to the customer.  My order was to eat there, but they give it to me in a bag.  I told them my order was to eat there and had to request a tray.  I really don't think they're focused on listening in the rush to push people through the assembly line of ordering.  I will not be returning to give them another shot at my business.  I chalk this up as a learning experience.",

Of Course I had to try the Italian Beef this tender morsel was amazing full of flavor and incredibly juicy. That it was served on a soft croissant was a bonus. I also had to try a Portillo's Hotdog the flavor was very flavorful for a hotdog. Cant wait to come back. The decor was very vibrant and fun. Outside seating was great.",

I tried a variety of foods including the regular hot dog (good but the bun was cold). The french fries were lacking in temperature and salty - this is surprising considering the number of people in line. You might think that the fries would be fresh with so many people in line; perhaps they were not ordering the fries   The Italian Beef sandwich was also good but lacked in presentation w/a chunky pepper and a tough roll. The Chocolate Cake Shake was out of this world; reason for the 4 stars.",

I love the Beef and Cheddar Croissant. It is what I order from Portillo's almost every time I am in one of their restaurants when I am back home, and it wAs a very pleasant surprise to find a Portillo's in the desert!  The food is great and the service is pretty good. I was thrown off a tad when i ordered my sandwich sweet and wet, a term that most Chicagoans would easily understand, and the young lady behind the cash register looked at me like I was crazy. Fortunately, I was able to translate the lingo into layman's terms pretty easily, and it got me one of the best Beef and Cheddar Croissants that I have had.",

We made out way over and while it looked busy, there wasn't a long wait to order or pick up our food. I decided to try the beef n cheddar and fries and my friend had a chili dog. Our food was ready after not too long and we grabbed a table and dug in. Unfortunately, the fries and lemonade far outshone the sandwich. It looked and tasted as though it had been preprepared and was sitting in a warmer. It was warm, not hot, and there was little cheddar to be found. My friend was equally unimpressed with his hot dog. For the price though, it wasn't a total rip off. On our way out, I grabbed a chocolate cake shake and he got a strawberry shortcake. Those definitely redeemed our experience and I loved the shake.   Maybe they are experiencing a lack of quality control in the kitchen since opening up? I'll probably try the Tempe location once it opens up but I was less than impressed with my first time here.",

Onion rings are good, fries are usually soggy unless fresh. Italian Beef sandwiches are tasteless soggy and gross, chicken sandwiches are decent but I'd rather go to chick file across the street. Hot dogs are nothing special and a mess. Everything is way over priced, they nickel and dime you for just about everything. No meal deals, every item is separate. They throw your food around in a bag until it gets to the end and finally give you a crumpled up tattered bag for orders to go and dine in. You cannot get your own refill so you need to wait in a drink refill line until someone will finally notice \"oh! Do you need a refill?\"....cheapskates. Costumer service is usually a bunch of rude older people that don't give a crap... unfortunately I try I to stop by here every 2-3 months or so to see if it gets any better, but this is the last time. I'm done with this place.",

He kept looking at me and then my ID over and over again like I was some kind of homeless person who shouldn't have a debit card on me.  I will NEVER come here again.  The manager was even more rude when he said it's company policy that they really make sure the is and card matches.  But what about the guy making it look like he didn't believe it was me in the photo in the ID. Quite offensive!!!' I am more than livid.  You're a \"fast food\" joint - get off your high horse.",

    "text": "Portillo's is obviously a Chicago legend and its the closest that you will get to having an authentic Italian beef sandwich or Chicago dog in AZ. Speaking of these two items, I tried one of each when my wife and I came in here a few weeks ago. I ordered the Italian beef sandwich \"dipped\" so it was pretty sloppy but really tasty as well. The beef was cooked nicely, but I was a little disappointed that you had to pay for the spicy peppers. You think that would just come standard? Anyways, the Chicago dog was nice too, the hot dog itself had good texture. To top of the meal, we ordered the famous chocolate cake shake. If you couldn't tell from the title of the shake alone, this thing was decadent. I actually thought that it was going to be a little more chocolatey considering the name, but it actually wasn't. My wife and I really enjoyed it. This place is huge by the way! There is a lot of seating but I'm sure this place gets crazy packed as well. Gotta come here to get your Chicago food fix.",

    "text": "Was so excited to order lunch for the office from here and was even more excited to get it delivered since we don't have time to leave at month end.   The order arrived on time but as we started to go through it and pass it out our disappointment set in.   1. We were completely missing a hot dog (we only ordered 3 entrees, 2 fries and 2 cheese sauce so it shouldn't be too hard to verify the order before it leaves the store). So now someone doesn't have their lunch.   2. Missing a cheese sauce (again, how hard is this to verify before you drive away with the food???)  3. The chili dog was put in a paper tray, wrapped in parchment paper, and put at the bottom of the bag... needless to say there was more chili on the parchment than the hot dog.   I called the store to complain and get the rest of the order delivered. First, I got hung up on. Second try I got a hold of the manager who was nice enough but still rubbed me the wrong way.   1. He said he would be happy to refund me the order if we come in to get the food we were missing. I ordered this for delivery for a reason, no one has time to go get lunch today because we have deadlines to reach. So I asked for the items that were missed to be redelivered. He had no problem doing that but now I get to wait another 30 minutes to eat...alone since everyone else will be done by then.   2. I suggested that they package the chili dogs in containers and not wrapped since they don't transport well that way. He says, \"yeah, we get a lot of complaints about that\". Well thanks for caring about all those other complaints and just rolling forward with crappy delivery service.   The food was good and fresh but the whole experience was not enjoyable. I appreciate the managers offer to reimburse me but don't appreciate that it came with stipulations.",

To start off, the person taking our order was very rude and seemed like they didn't want to be there. I understand having a rough day at work because we are human but you should not take it out on the customers. Also, we are from out of state and wanted to ask a few questions/get recommendations and the employee was not having it. We ordered the chopped salad, a hot dog, the dipped beef sandwich, cheese fries, and chocolate cake shake. The order was for dine in but all the food came shoved and smashed in a to-go bag. The hot dog was on the bottom of the bag and completely smashed. The salad was not fresh at all. The best part was the ditalini pasta in it. The \"cheese\" fries were just fries with container of cheese to dip in. The beef sandwich was so soggy and was also smashed in the bag so it was hard to eat since it just fell apart. The best part was the chocolate cake shake. It tasted exactly like a blended piece of cake. The decor inside was cool but other than that it wasn't worth a second visit.",

I've NEVER ordered a Chicago Hot Dog that by the time I get to my table IN the restaurant the bun is totally soggy and falling apart! Plus you've now shrunk the size of the hot dog! Here's an idea...pay MORE money for buns that don't fall apart (I know you've cut buns costs from your bun manufacturer because of the amount of buns used). It shows in your below average hot dog and bun.",

    "text": "Super disappointed today, the food is still great (when it's made right) but the service has consistently gone downhill. The attentiveness from the employees taking your order is always subpar. I don't think we've ever had a super friendly cashier and it feels like they just want to get you in and out, however, the last couple of times we've gone they just have a horrible time listening to what we ordered. The first time wasn't too bad but yesterday evening the girl at the register just forgot things left and right and she didn't even care.  When our order was called we sat down and noticed the fries were missing, I looked down at the receipt and saw that she didn't even ring them up so I went back to the counter, paid for the fries we initially asked for and let her know that we had just gotten our food. It was packed and I really didn't want to have to wait again for something so small. She went to the back and quite literally threw the two large fries in a bag and handed it to me.   Whatever...at least I got that taken care of only to sit back down and noticed all of the condiments for both orders were wrong. One sandwich we specifically asked for lettuce, tomato, onion, and extra pickles (two of which should come on it automatically), what did we get? Just chicken and lettuce in a bun. Also the burger we got (I have an aversion to red onion) and had specifically asked for no onion with that order and what did we get? Onion.   Back up to the counter I went this time asking the same girl for a manager instead since she wasn't really paying attention. I was really frustrated that I could just sit and enjoy my meal but had to keep coming up, interrupting a nice evening out, just to keep getting items they missed. I let the \"manager\" Jaimie know that having to come up there not once but twice to correct mistakes that were clearly mentioned was super inconvenient.  I thought going to management directly to address any issues at the time they happen is what restaurants usually want you to do but he just stared at my like..what was he supposed to do? I tried to help him get the hint that this was not okay and at this point has become a hassle for the customer and the employee with the poor customer service skills is standing right next to you. I said \"so is something going to be done? Can these get remade or something???\"   Jaimie did not seem to care in the slightest, not one single apology for any misunderstanding or lack in communication. Nothing but..\"well we've got the tomatoes and pickles in the back here, I can get them for you.\" Yeah, that would have been great if they were on the food from the beginning instead of us putting everything back together at our table. He hands me two containers of condiments and I make my way back, finally sit down only to discover he gave me those large pickle halves that don't fit on sandwiches. Cmon dude. AGAIN I went back to the counter and got them switched out with the correct kind that usually go on their menu items, ended up giving my boyfriend the onions they misplaced on my order and called it a day.   It's the little things that added up and turned something small and silly into an overall stressful dining experience. I think if the manager had given a simple apology with some genuine concern and effort to get us the right condiments or had at least remade it properly I would he understand the ordeal but no help was offered and the manager's attitude about it all left a bad taste in my mouth. Super disappointed. When we got home it was mentioned how Portillo's has become such a hassle when having to dine-in and I would definitely agree.",

He even tried to do a double check on the order initially at the drive through they said \"don't worry everything is in there\".  So he left only to find out when he got home that part of the order was missing  I'm not sure if this is a gimmick because most people won't go back since they don't realize their order is missing so the restaurant gets to keep the extra $$ and food or of this is just secondary to poor staff and just not caring.  I don't know..... But cmon ??!!!!",

It was a nightmare to say the least.... 30 minutes later my food has been sitting on the counter NOT in the warmer, The attitude of the manager was UGLY and I was just wanting to walk away from it all. DO NOT TRY TO USE A COMPANY CARD..... Because they will treat you as if you're a thief...They didn't even apologize after they got the faxed authorization form.... So fast forward, I'm back at the office, food is 45 minutes late, and NOT hot, and we are not happy.... I call and get hung up on. OVER IT. Wont be going here again.....",

I stopped at Portillos for my very first time with some fellow teachers to eat some food before we went to our 2nd jobs. The woman calling out order numbers to pick up your order gave us dirty looks. Then before I got my order, she asked me if I was a teacher and I responded that I was. She then stated that \"what I was doing to children was wrong\" and basically wanted to argue politics with me and tell me how terrible teachers are. I took my food and I went outside to eat with my friends as I had no desire to engage with someone when I was simply trying to get something to eat during a long day. I cannot believe that Portillos allows their employees to voice their political views and berate their customers. I called on my way to my 2nd job to talk to the manager. He said he would talk to her about her behavior. This was my first and LAST visit to Portillos.",

First, I took my daughter for a late dinner on Tuesday night; then I sprung a friend over at Westminster Retirement for his first Chicago Italian Beef yesterday; then my son on his last night in Scottsdale wanted some comfort food before journeying to California for his new job; and lastly, today we had a UYE with Phoenix Buffet King Rand H, Robyn N, Mike C and his fiancee Jackie R.  Over the last few days I've gotten to know Mike Portillo pretty well.  He's a great guy who is in charge of Training at his family's restaurants and is here working the kitchen with the rest of his employees. Given the crazy opening three months ago, he's done an incredible job! A textbook management case study if you ask me!  The food is still great!  And now, that some our out of town guests have returned to points north, it's easier to get in and out of here. The place today was packed, but with three/four cashiers working, the wait-time was less than ten minutes to get your food. Nice!  Sooooo, if you feel like an Italian Beef, Combo with sausage, or a Chicago \"Red Hot\" stop on by.  Now a shout-out to Nancy P, who is next door at Scottsdale Health waiting to deliver her son and tells me: \"Think my hubby will be spending a lot of time in line here while I'm recovering after our son is born!\"  You hear that Mike!",

They also have fries and burgers. For sweet treats, they have various shakes, malts, and desserts.  We shared a big beef, dipped, cheese fries, and a large vanilla shake. The big beef was excellent. The beef and broth had a really nice, rich flavor, and the bread held up well to being dipped in broth. We added sweet peppers and mozzarella, which were both good additions to the sandwich ($.50 extra per topping). As for the fries, rather than putting the cheese on top of the fries, the fries and cheese are supplied separately so that you dip the fries into the cheese. The fries themselves were crisp and crinkle-cut. The shake was huge, and very thick.  While the parking lot is a bit small, the restaurant itself is quite spacious, and we had no problem finding a seat despite it being busy on a Saturday afternoon.   Our total for a Big Beef with 2 toppings, cheese fries, a large shake, and a small soda was about $17, which isn't too bad considering the amount of food we got. We were both definitely stuffed after eating!  I'm looking forward to the opening of the Tempe Marketplace Portillo's, so I can enjoy tasty Chicago style eats closer to where I live!",

Now, instead of a happy returning customer, you have an upset one who won't be returning any time soon. On top of all of that, they had a fly problem buzzing around the pickup window. That's two strikes for management.   I would be remiss if I did not point out the shinning stars of the restaurant. Obviously the cooks, as the food was tasty as always.

    "text": "I FINALLY made it in to the ever popular Portillo's.  I wanted to go for the opening night UYE, but it was just too cold for my thin blood.  So, I waited to go here for a Yelper luncheon.  I met up with  Mike C., Georgie M, Rand H and Marvin A.  Only girl in the group and that was fine by me!    What an amazingly delicious place.  I left there thinking, I understand the excitement.  What's baffling to me is how a place so big can do, at least, one thing so well.  This was my first time taking a \"dip\" in the Portillo's family of restaurants.  I've been to Chicago plenty, lived in the burbs for a short while, but never heard of Portillo's.  No matter, what I lacked in hearing, I made up for in tasting yesterday.    Oh yeah... this place has been open about 3 or 4 weeks now and the crowd has yet to die down.  I highly doubt that the crowd will.  At any rate, I get there just before 11am and you can tell by noon the place would be packed.  There was a very short line that I hop in to place my order.  I checked out the menu before I arrive and then I wrote down my order so when it was time to order, I just read off my little piece of paper.  But, to be honest, I don't know where their menu is displayed.  I did try to take a last minute peek to see if I wanted to change my order, but I remember thinking, \" I don't see the menu, just stick to the script.\"  I pay and then I wait for my number to be called.  The place is REALLY REALLY LOUD, so you definitely need to pay attention for you number to be called.    I ordered the half sausage/half beef sandwich - Dipped baby Dipped and with hot and sweet pepper and mozzarella cheese!  What a simply delicious sandwich.  I RARELY eat bread, but I wanted to devour the bread.  the bread was firm, yet soft.  It has a subtle hint of Italian spices that you can definitely taste.  I highly recommend adding the mozzarella cheese for that reason.  I wish I had my sandwich DOUBLE DIPPED!  or more gravy on the side!   I didn't enjoy the sausage, and I would never order that again.  I also ordered the fries.  This is where I kinda got irritated.  YOu can't order a salad for less than 5 dollars there.  I wanted a simple side salad with my sandwich.  I need a reasonable option to make up for the calorie bomb!  But they don't offer a small salad, so I ordered the fries.  Definitely some of the best tasting fries I've had in quite sometime.  The perfect amount of salt with a crisp exterior while hiding the soft warm middle.    I will definitely go back.  I hope sooner than later.",

LOL -- gotta love my Chicago peeps!    Needless to say, this place is slamming with patrons salivating to get a taste of a Chicago style hotdog!  The place itself has nostalgic signs hanging from the ceiling and walls.  I gather these are all old school Chicago neighborhoods or Chicago based signage; along with some vintage photography.  Not too easy on the eyes, but whatever!  I ordered the Chicago Style dog of course along with some cheese fries and onion rings.  I also had a taste of their Polish dog too.  I thought the Polish dog was okay at best.  It was just grilled onions on a polish dog and bread -- um okay.  The Chicago style is always my favorite.  Pickles, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos and a hot dog.  You thought I was gonna sing the Big Mac song didn't you!?  Truthfully, I thought the hot dog was okay at best.  I think it was over hyped and you can get this \"Chicago Style\" hot dog anywhere in the valley that sells \"Chicago Style\" hot dogs.  I think it's say that this place was the talk of the town when it first opened and sadly it didn't deliver!  It's like watch Transformer 2 and 3 -- what the heck happened!?   At the end of the day, I think if you haven't experienced it yet, then I would recommend this place.  However, you're if you're expecting miracles in your palates and the site of a food deity, then please pass on by cause it's not your religion. - Enjoy!",

    "text": "I visited Portillo's after several of my co-workers raved about the place. I probably won't bother going back; like its gaudy decor, it's all shine and little substance.  SERVICE: I'm not a huge fan of the cattle-call style of food service. The organization was pretty lax when I first arrived and we got 'cut' in line several times as groups came in. Eventually an employee came out and started sifting people into appropriate lines.  When it came time to get food, we were back to 'cattle-call' again. The woman calling out the orders was humorous at first; eventually her rhyming and overly-loud microphone just gave me a headache.  FOOD: I had an Italian beef sandwich. The beef was mostly flavorless and somewhat dry, even though I had ordered extra gravy; the cheese was rubbery, but at least it had some flavor from the grease on it.   I tried a bite of a co-worker's hot dog; it wasn't anything special.  AMBIANCE: Can you hear me now? No? Then you might be at Portillo's. The only thing louder than the mishmash of decor is the actual noise level in the building. Don't bother trying to talk here. Including a pair of noise-canceling headphones with each order would be nice.  OVERALL: If you couldn't tell, I didn't really see any positives to the place. The food was mediocre, the style of service is annoying, and the noise level might just be tinnitus-inducing. From now on if I want an Italian beef I'll go to Guido's, and I'll make the trek down to Ted's Hot Dogs in Tempe when I want a good frank.",

    "text": "Have you ever been to a small food-shop owned by an immigrant of any nationality where they seem to be skimping on everything to make ends meet? Common, we have all been to those places. You ask for an extra side of their delicious ethnic sauce and they want those two quarters in your pocket. They charge for the three day old iced tea. I understand for they are a small establishment. Portillo's is a big Corporate operation.   Well, cheap owner of Portillo's, can you put in a self-serve beverage refill counter? I do not want to have to go awkwardly across the pick up line to get another beverage. This is Arizona. We expect free refills with 105 degree weather.    At least you replaced uncle Sam's. That clown didn't even have blue cheese for his wings.    Oh yes, this is what happens when you skimp on beverage service in Arizona. In my dehydrated state I am not getting to the food until the middle of the review. The Italian Beef was excellent but small. I would like a 8 - 10 inch option for a couple extra bucks. The gardinere * lasted a few bites into the sandwich. Again, is there a guy fresh off the 747 skimping on food cost involved with  the operation?   Yes. I will return to Portillo's because it is good and well priced. I will pay extra for a couple of extra inches on a sandwich. In fact, I am back at the office now and still hungry. Maybe I will return for that delicious Italian Beef.   Oh yes, the employees were excellent at executing efficient counter service during a peak hour.",

    "text": "Woe! Woe, wait just a minute!  Hold onto your hats cowboys/girls, this Portillo's is the real deal!  It's worthiness is much greater than some of the 3 star reviews I'm reading on the Yelp iPad-acus.  I've been here now 3 times (Yes, I missed a checkin for you fact seeking yelp nerds) and this is the Portillo's I've grown to love when traveling to Chicago many time over the years.    This Portillo's reminds me of the one in Dekalb IL.  The decor, shape and  size are very similar.  The food taste just as good as well!  The only thing different are the droves of people trying to go here for a bite to eat all at the same time!!  But don't let that stop you from giving this Portillo's a try!  It's a fantastic place to go for a delicious hot Italian roast beef sandwich dry, dipped or wet!  Their hotdogs are great and so are their salads (believe it or not :-)    If your feeling adventurous and hungry, I must warn you this can NOT be good for your health but it is really tasty good, try their Italian roast beef and grilled sausage with peppers!  OH MY!  It is an extremely dangerous and yet delicious mouth full of goodness!  You'll be tempted to order one of their DELISH shakes and a side of fries with this, but don't unless you are eating with someone that can call the paramedics in case you get a carb overload...   The only downer about Portillo's is how they want you to wait at the counter to get your food before sitting down.  This is not how the AZ peeps like to do things.  So they should adjust to their new environment and come up with a better way to get people their food.   In looking forward to going back again real soon.  I hope to see you their!",

I also tried their dipped beef sandwich, which is actually my preference. Just know that the dipped beef is a little messy to eat and the bread gets real mushy...mmmmm. Can't beat the portions either.  Value: I thought the price was very reasonable for what you get.   Service: Outstanding.  All in all, if you've never been to a Portillo's, I highly recommend. It's like Chi-town's In-N-Out. Even if you end up not liking it, I think you'll appreciate the experience.",

    "text": "I am writing this as a born-and-bred Chicagoan who used to go to a Portillo's location at least once a week before I relocated to Tempe--it is EXACTLY the same as \"back home\" with 2 exceptions (which I will get to later).  Construction and ambiance--exactly the same.  Burgers and fries--exactly the same.  Milkshakes--exactly the same.  Maxwell Street Polish--EXACTLY THE SAME--thank you God and Dick Portillo for FINALLY bringing a real, bona-fide Maxwell Street Polish (read:  Chicago classic) out here to the desert!    The two exceptions that may put Chicagoans off:  1.) staff is very well-trained, but they are not Chicagoans, don't understand the \"passion\" of the food, and although they show great potential don't seem to have the same \"write on the bag, move on, pay, and pickup\" expertise as they do back home.  2.) space-case, self-absorbed Scottsdale patrons who don't know how to order or to KEEP THE PICKUP AREA OPEN AND CLEAR whilst waiting for their food.  For those \"meh\" reviews by AZ natives--you have NO CONCEPT of a hot dog, Polish sausage, or Italian Beef, and you REALLY need to keep your purportedly-\"expert\" opinions to yourselves.  Ted's is NY style--so there is no comparison.  Other locations here in Phoenix--not the same.  PS to the dipstick who said this is a \"chain\" restaurant--it is NOT.  Dick Portillo and family are the sole owners (and will always keep it this way) and visit each location multiple times per year to ensure that every \"branch\" is just as good as the original.  As for them being \"sure to fail unless the food quality improves;\" the food is the SAME as it is in Chicago, and to the best of my knowledge no Portillo's location has ever failed since Dick first opened shop in the 1960's.  So you might want to do a little research (and actually be from Chicago) before you run off at the yap with your idiotic opinions.  Bottom line:  Chicagoans--go and shed a tear of joy as you have a taste of home.  Smug Non-Chicagoans who have never been to Chi-town and have no clue as to what you are talking about--shut the F up.",

I was there on opening day and have been a loyal customer ever since.  Love their Italian Beef sandwiches.  I usually do mine dry (very little gravy) with cheese, hot peppers and onions. I also order a side a gravy to dip my sandwich in. Wish they included these extras in the price of the sandwich but they all are an extra cost. You can't go wrong with their cheese fries. They are a crinkle cut and one of my faves.  Their cheeseburgers are actually really good and my kids love their Chocolate Cake Shake.  If I'm feeling like I need to cut back on the meat and bread, I order a salad instead. My two favorites are the Poppyseed Fruit w/ Chicken Salad and the Chopped Salad. The salads come with a lemon poppyseed muffin and are very tasty.    Overall, their price points are reasonable and the service is good. They are very efficient with handling crowds during their busy times. This is kind of minor, but it is always freezing inside their restaurant.  So much so that we sometimes eat outside even in the summer.  Bring a jacket if you are always cold.",

    "text": "Meh - what is the big deal here folks? Honestly?  Lord knows that Phoenix is packed (PACKED!) with homesick Chicagoans  who miss the comfort foods of their childhood.  I will say that I was impressed with the building and structure - this is a huge palatial restaurant, and I love the little retro detailing inside. It is eye candy at it's finest, and the place seems to anticipate a massive following based on the cavernous size. Neon everywhere, cool old photos (I'm from L.A. so the Chicago memorabilia was fun to look at).   But in a way it all seemed kind of fake - surreal really - like a Disneyland Main Street USA - or a movie set. It feels like they are trying too hard... to make a new place that intends to expand to multiple locations feel like some kind of old style place you grew up in as a kid.   So in the end, this place is a chain... and the food tastes that way.  With all the talk about the amazing PORTILLO'S - well gushes really (mostly from ex-Chicago pals who raved about this sacred shrine), I had high expectations.  The (mostly young) staff seemed very well trained, clean-cut and knowledgeable in the In 'N Out Burger kinda way.  Admittedly I have only eaten at Portillo's once - about 10:30 PM last night (Sat). I ordered their (supposedly) famous chopped salad and let me cut to the chase by saying that this was basically a salad you could get at any TGI Fridays or other non-cult fast food joint.   I watched it being made before being hand tossed - tasteless & cheap cubed while meat chicken (like from a can), little bits of macaroni, cheap (mostly) iceberg lettuce (menu says Romaine too but I count not detect any) -blue cheese (didn't taste any) -  Bac-Os bacon bits - and a VERY (overly) strong creamy horseradish dressing. Horseradish? Yup.   This is NOT a great salad folks - give me a break  What a joke.   They should have more appropriately named this stinker a \"horseradish chopped salad\" as that is exactly what it tasted like.All horseradish!  I know, I know...shoulda ordered their world famous hotdog or Italian Beef huh? I wasn't in the mood for meat last night, but I will give Portillo's another shot some day.   But so far my initial impression is this place is based on the fantasies and exaggerated memories of the many lonely heart Chicago natives who miss their basic staples.   Apparently the Portillo's genius/mogul owners have big plans to open another location soon at Tempe Marketplace. Woo-hoo! Go get 'em guys. Best of luck - over expansion too quickly literally killed the once high flying Krispy Kreme Doughnut operation in Phoenix - why not take your time and improve the food a little? Best way to kill a cult is to over expand - there are only so many Chicago people drinking the Kool Aid, right?  There is nothing wrong mind you with simple food like dogs and burgers made exceedingly well -  but so far TED'S Hot Dog's in Tempe is the real deal for quality and authenticity.   The authenticity of a TED's looks and tastes REAL.   Portillo's may kick ass here in Phoenix, but so far I am not at all impressed with the food. Hot dogs and burgers are a dime a dozen.",

Going to Portillo's in Scottsdale was like watching the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as an adult--I don't know what I ever saw in this.  To begin, I visited twice: once during peak hours and once in between the lunch and dinner rush. During peak hours, the wait was long, I was scolded for taking a picture inside, the order was incorrect, and the burgers were similar in quality to Wendy's. The second visit wasn't much better. I entered the drive through to see more attendants than cars and waited 15 minutes for a cheeseburger with only one car ahead of me. Upon arriving home, the fries were only half full, the soda was mostly ice, and the burger was a soggy mess of mayo and ketchup. I took three bites of the burger and tossed it in the trash.  The food doesn't live up to the hype or the price. I will not be returning.",

I had no idea what to expect other than knowing they took over the old spot that Uncle Sam's used to fill on 91st and Shea.   First off, I COULD NOT BELIEVE how busy it was, especially for a weekday lunch in an area without a large concentration of businesses (I work downtown). Drive through line was a mile long (but seemed to be moving quickly). When we got inside I was shocked at the amount of people cramed into this large space. Not a table to be found and long lines again, but we had made the drive so there was no turning back... Glad we didn't because that line moved quickly also.  My buddy and I both got the \"combo\" sandwich, which is an Italian Beef with a sausage stuck in there also. Strangly enough my Chicago friend got a chicken sandwich, which apparently he loves there.  Cool thing about the \"combo\", or just regular beef sandwiches, is you can choose how much \"gravy\" you want on them. Hardly any, some poured on top, or, and of course the one that I picked, DIPPED. They dip the who damn sandwich in the \"gravy\" (beef drippings). NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN BOUT.  We got cheese fries too. Fries were good but they put the cheese on the side...kind of a bummer, BUT the sandwiches were excellent... Best Italian Beef I've had other than Luke's of Chicago on Indian School, which is quite a compliment.  We did end up finding seats by the way. Very crowded place, but a lot of turnover, so if you just wait a second something will pop up.  Prices were excellent also. Most sandwiches were right around $5 bucks, even the Halibut fish sandwich, which I gotta try next...I'll be back. Gotta try the dogs too!!  Enjoy",

    "text": "We were great fans of Portillo's when it first opened, even though there were long lines.  I am from Chicago and appreciated that they brought hometown favorites here to Scottsdale.  Tonight, we ordered one of the Chicago basics to go:  a big, Italian beef sandwich, wet, on a crispy roll with sweet peppers and extra a jus on the side  It came back on a burnt roll, dry, with 3 overcooked pepper slivers that looked like they were from yesterday's leftovers and   a 1/2 full, tiny cup of a jus.  When I called the manager, Peter about the problem, he could not be any more rude, unhelpful and condescending and  finally said we could expect a refund in 7-10 days,    When, after 10 minutes waiting for and talking to him, I asked to talk with his boss, he said Jim had left for the day.  No I'm sorry.  No how can we make this right. No nothing.  My advice:   Stay away from this used to be a good place and go to Spinato's or Vermont Sandwich Company for a great beef sandwich, They understand being gracious to their customers; consistently serve real, quality food; and stand behind what they sell.",

Great atmosphere and outstanding service for a fast good joint. My only disappointment is that they didn't bring to Arizona the Barnelli's side of the restaurant. Two requests for Mr. Portillo - please bring Barnelli's and please, please build in the Northwest valley - Peoria, Arizona would be great in honor of its sister city in Illinois.",

    "text": "Although I am a midwesterner by birth, my first experience of Portillos was here in the Valley of the Sun.   I've been super interested to try it, but wanted to wait until the initial craziness was past.   We finally checked it out this past weekend and wow! So yummy.   Parking was crowded, but we found a spot easily enough. There is a nice patio at the front with plenty of seating and tables overshadowed by umbrellas. The restaurant is kitschy, with memorabilia covering the walls and hanging from the ceiling - Flash Gordon poster, bicycle, airplane pedal car...   The dining room is very clean and teeming with staff - we were greeted at arrival, handed paper menus, and ushered into one of two lines stretching up to the counter. We reviewed the menus and when we reached the front of the line, were directed to one of the windows to order. This whole process was a bit frenzied - we didn't really have an ample amount of time to decide on our orders before we hit the front of the line, and when we did, getting up to a window while not cutting off someone from the other line was somewhat stressful. One of our only snags during the dining experience came when we got to the counter and learned that the printed menus that we had been looking over to make our choices were NOT actually current menus. So we had to make some rapid re-selections on-the-fly.   Your order is assigned a number and you have to listen for it to be announced, then go pick it up from the window. The girls announcing that the orders are ready have funny catch phrases for each number: \"Fifty Four, wait no more!\" etc, which is entertaining the first 5 times you hear them (but I'll come back to this)   You pick up your orders on large trays with drink holders in each corner and reminderd me of the trays that used to clip to your car window at A&W Rootbeer stands (if anyone remembers those) They're handy for transporting your food to the table, but are very bulky and get in the way if your table is crowded, like ours was.  We ordered The Italian Beef with spicy peppers and mozzarella, a Grilled Chicken Sandwich, a Hamburger, and a few orders of crinkle french fries.   The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was pretty okay - more \"meh\" than amazing.   The Hamburger was good - flattened thinner, similar to other midwestern imports (Freddie's, for example) which meant that the flavor was more concentrated and it was crispier than your standard burger. The bread got very soggy and the toppings were in disarray, so it was a mess to eat.   The crinkle fries were okay - we got three orders for the 3.5 of us and I'd probably tailor that down to 2 orders (or maybe even 1) the next time. They came out CRAZY hot, too hot to eat, so we had to wait a bit before digging in. They tasted alright and had good texture, but weren't anything to write home about.  The Italian Beef was, as others say, incredibly good. The beef was sliced very thinly and then piled on thick.  It was savory, juicy, and very flavorful. The bread was pretty thin and did get terribly soggy from the juices of the sandwich. I ordered it with spicy peppers and mozzarella; the mozzarella was barely there, but I was so glad that I ordered the peppers! The juice from the peppers permeated the whole sandwich, giving an extra dimension to the flavors - the peppers themselves were not overwhelmingly spicy, which was nice. There were some little crinkly pickled carrots in the mix as well, which was weird at first but tasted fine. Eating the sandwich is tricky: it comes in two wrappers, a larger outer wrapper that is more \"dry\" and a more tightly wrapped inner wrapper. I took my sandwich out of the outer wrapper but kept the inner wrapper on so that it would blockade the sogginess and keep the sandwich together. This was a good move; my friend who also got the Italian Beef did NOT do this, and it was a huge mess.   The dining room is very hectic. The seating is bordered by the line of guests, the order counter, the pickup window, and the catering counter. The cacophony of the many guests plus the announcer calling out the orders is definitely less than relaxing.  Hearing \"54 wait no more\" 100 times while you dine is not so great. However, the decor, very friendly and attentive employees, cleanliness of the restaurant, and overall casual level of the place all make for a very fun experience that was ultimately quite enjoyable.   Pricing was okay - just over $30 for three adults and one baby, so not too bad.   The staff were phenomenal. My expectations are generally pretty low in a place that has really young employees, but you can tell that the training at Portillos is top-notch and that they ask a lot of their team. We were greeted, treated politely and professionally, attended to (they have employees bussing the tables, collecting trash as you finish) and thanked as we left.   I can definitely recommend Portillos for a delicious and lovely casual lunch or dinner. Be sure to check it out!",

In fact, they seemed downright offended that we returned a very burnt chicken sandwich, making me wait 10 minutes for a new one, not even offering to bring it to my table, where my family was waiting. They also forgot a couple of items from our order.  That said, the fries, onion rings, hot dogs, and beef were excellent, and the location is much nicer than the one at McClintock. However, when you pay a premium for fast food you expect decent service.  By the way I am originally from Chicago, & I understand the attitude, but this staff needs more people skills training.   They earn 4 stars and not 3 cuz the other few visits were not as bad as this one.",

It was Ok, just wouldn't make it a point to go there.  Unless I was in the area.  The service was good, and as crazy at it was, they were still very quick with the order taking and delivery of food!",

It was nice to see all the folks from the Naperville, IL location that I had not seen in about 3 years. The food was great! It was everything I remembered from the good and the bad!   The Good:   Food taste was the same, the Beef has great flavor that I have yet to taste when eating other Beef sandwiches from around the US.   The Bad:  My order was incorrect, funny thing is I'm use to it from the Naperville location so it was funny that this location made the same error. But overall the food is great and the experience for me is the same which is great and I'm glad they are in town!",

One order was in cash for my friend, so I could give him his change. The other was with my debit card. He said corporate doesn't allow two separate payments cause I could be doing a scam. I didn't know ordering food with real money and a debit card was against the law. I am disabled and came here to pick up food because they're open late. I will be calling corporate first thing on Monday. To treat a disabled customer or any paying customer with such disrespect is absolutely appalling. What kind of business are you running where you treat customers like a piece of garbage? I will never be back here. I will let all my friends and family to go elsewhere. You want a hot dog go to Weinerschitznel or Sonic. I hope Jamie is fired for this. I've been in customer service for over 10 years and have never been treated so badly and by a manager! Disgusting customer service.",

We live right down the street and when I got home the Italian beef and the double cheeseburger both had slimy soaked buns, fell apart and were inedible, along with both meats being flavorless and patties being burnt. I contacted the restaurant and spoke with Peter(The manager), expressing my unhappiness with the customer service I'd received, unfortunately Peter was unprofessional, insincere, while rudely questioning my integrity by saying \"I was the first person to complain tonight\" then questioned how I ordered the meal Insinuating it was my fault the food was soggy, and that the dry burnt patty was of no concern. Peter didn't appreciate my  business, or really care about my concerns, he then asked for my address so he could forward it to corporate instead of using an in store solution.Due to this Extremely Bad Experience, I will never visit or contact that Portillo's again!!!!",

I felt a little rushed through the ordering process, but they made it work and it was definitely fast service, which was great because I was on a break from a class across the street. Oh yeah, the seating arrangement was a pain though! The place is huge but not big enough for everyone to sit down, causing people to turn to seat vultures, eyeballing you to hurry it up with your meal they don't have to stand there anymore.  Now the food... It was delicious! I had an Italian beef (dipped plus hot peppers) and a bottle of water. My co-worker was kind enough to share her fries with cheese sauce and I only had a few, but let me be honest in saying I could make a meal out of those! Yum. So, I would be back for the fries alone.  Let me tell you why the two stars and why only the cheese fries would get my business. I was soooo sick to my stomach the rest of the day. I could feel the grease from the \"gravy\" sitting in my stomach and was belching the taste through the next day. This is not normal for me and so disgusting! Like I said earlier, it was delicious, however, after that bout I am too scared to give the sandwich another shot.",

    "text": "Ok, here's the thing about Portillo's - the place is a freakin' zoo.  It was a Sunday afternoon...  A hot, muggy, and generally miserable afternoon - to be outside that is.  We had plans to go out for dinner, so we wanted something light for lunch.  Hmmmm, fast food? No. Salad bar? Not today. Oh I know, how about we grab a quick bite at Portillo's  - I hear they have great hot dogs!  And so we went....  First thing I noticed as we approached were the workers standing outside along the drive-thru lane - looking like car salesmen waiting to grab you.  Apparently tho, they are there to assist the massive amounts of cars that come thru - like In N Out.  Next thing I noticed was the large dining area consisting of tables, booths, high tops, and bars.  The 3rd thing I noticed was the massive amount of people and long line to order.   To make a long story short, we had problems finding a place to sit - it was like trying to park and when someone leaves everyone rushes to the vacancy like musical chairs.  We found an uncomfortable bar seat.  As far as the food, it was just OK.  I got the polish and my girl got a regular hot dog.  Both were tasty, yes, but boy were they train wrecks.  Maybe it was a bad day to go, but dining in an overly crowded restaurant, sitting in an uncomfortable bar stool facing the wall while trying to negotiate an OK hot dog falling apart at the seams is only worthy of 2 stars in my book.  I will probably only go back if someone else is treating me.",

Best hot dog you'll ever have, and it's only $3 for a jumbo. it's only the best if you get everything on it. If you're a plain hot dog eater, go to Costco. Their cheese fries are great, but only get them if you like the fake nacho cheese, cause that's what they put on them. I get my beef sandwich \"dipped\" in gravy, with mozzarella and sweet peppers. You might need a fork and knife, but it's worth it. Skip the chocolate cake shake. IMO, I don't know what the big fuss is over that thing.  Originally they had people from Chicago training the Scottsdale team on how to act like they are from Chicago. Unfortunately, they are (or at least, seem to be) all gone now, so you're left with teenagers trying to pretend like their from Chicago. It's both endearing and awkward.   The location is great and the play great music. A little nostalgia never hurt anyone. I wish they would allow dogs on the patio like Culver's across the street.",

Italian beef was soggy and had a flavor I didn't care for, I think the was the gravy, it had an off/almost artificial beef flavor.  Their onion rings are very good and I love the crinkle cut fries.  I would like to try the tamale in a bowl and their sausage sandwich so I'll be heading back but you can get better burgers/dogs at other places (AJ's supermarket is actually better).

Portillo's was never my favorite place to eat Italian Beef living there, but my family really liked it so we went quite a bit.  Now that Portillo's is in Scottsdale (and is coming to Tempe), it might be just about the best Italian Beef in town.  I like their hot giardiniera on a full sized sandwich made dry.  If you know italian beef, you know that even your dry sandwich is going to be soggy.  Ask for it wet and the thing practically falls apart.  I do miss my local italian beef spot that had better choices for bread.  I also miss being able to buy italian beef frozen at Costco in Naperville, IL.  However, living in AZ and not having to withstand the Chicago Winter... I will take Portillo's!   This location is great when there is no rush (think midday).  I have eaten here 4 times and my order has always been correct... even when we placed two to go orders and had a party of six.    If you're ordering chicken... you're doing it wrong.  If you want a \"lighter choice,\" get the chopped salad.  Everyone I know thinks it is AMAZING.  Of course, I don't eat pork but... get it!",

I was so hungry and took the rest of it off the salad just to eat something. The chicken sand felt like a box of air when we took it out of the bag. It was mushy and came with nothing on it. Plus, they wanted $.31 for ranch dressing. You must be kidding me?! The onion rings tasted like frozen rings and the ketchup cups were so small, we couldn't even dip it in anything.  We saw a lot of people got the beef sandwich, and looked good, but will never go here again to even try it. I'll take a bag of Skittles and a Snickers for dinner before I'll visit this place.",

    "text": "As a Chicago native, I'm reviewing with that standard in mind. While not bad, this place does fall short a bit. My usual order (for years) has been a hotdog with no tomato and no pepper, a bowl of chili, and fries.  Moving out to AZ, I was sad that I'd only get my Portillo's fix when I flew back to visit family. So when one opened in Scottsdale, I was all over it.  I've been quite a few times at this point.   Hot dog - pretty much as expected. Hasn't let me down.  Chili - gross. I seriously don't know what happened, but it's thicker somehow and lacking something. I tested on my last trip to IL, and it hadn't changed there. It's just bad here.  Fries - hard to mess up. My go-to side.  Onion rings - gross. Super hard, oddly sweet, nothing special.   I use to love the strawberry smoothie, but that's not served here. I did try the chocolate cake shake for the very first time a few days ago and was mightily impressed. I'd never had it before, so I can't compare to IL. While it falls short in a few things, my kids and I have made this our after-zoo spot.   Question though...when on earth did the relish turn neon green? I'm certain it wasn't that color before...?",

    "text": "Today after Church my wife and I decided to stop at Portillo's on Shea for an early lunch.  Prior to placing our order we both went into the restrooms to wash our hands.  I exited first and waited for my wife.  When she exited she walked to the ordering area and requested to speak with a manager. Upon his arrival (Nate) my wife explained that they were out of handsoap in the women's restroom and that she observed an employee in uniform exit the restroom without washing her hands.  The Manager stares  \" we have handsantatizers she must have used\".  We both watched her go directly to her work  station processing food orders at the food line.  We placed our order and sat down. Once we received our order it was completely wrong and missing items.  I went back to the manager and told him about our order and that we did not appreciate the way he handled my wife's complaint.  The manager stated that he spoke with the employee.  We both know for fact that he did not speak with her as we watched to see if he did.  I understand things happen but when it comes to food safety and health of your guests there is no room for error.  Plus I do not appreciate being lied to by the manager. You lost our business. Businesses need to understand we as consumers have choices as we work hard for our income.  I would encourage others who have had a bad experience here to post your comments.  Other reviews of the establishment show a consistent pattern of poor guest service.",

The food quality has definitely gone down since the corporate takeover but that's to be expected when you go from an individual owner that grew the business from a humble hot dog stand. That's not my gripe, service is. The general manager Jaime is an unprofessional, unfriendly person that should not be in customer service or a managerial role. Seeing his poor attitude towards customers, it's clear that employees think it's acceptable to be unfriendly as well. This place needs a management change and new friendly faces that appreciate their job and the customers they serve. Save Portillo's!",

I ordered the beef and cheddar croissant. It is disgusting. The menu description says it is served on a toasted croissant, but what I got was a sandwich so wet and slimy I couldn't pick it up. It was so wet it resembled uncooked dough. It was inedible. The beef was good, but under seasoned. My husband went to the counter to ask for a new roll. They charged him $.75 for it. I scraped all the pasty, slimy bread off the beef and transferred it to the new roll. That was much better, but now cold. I would never order that again. The first pic is of the wet slimy bread, and the second is with the new roll.",

The owners of this specific operation should visit a Portillo's in Chicago to learn how to make this properly.  Better yet, while in Chicago they should get one at Al's on Taylor street.

We just left having lunch there and while we were waiting for our food the power goes out. Needless to say what we got was far from standard.   My burger was completely burnt and hard with a hard slab of cold cheese. The fries were ok but instead of the coke i ordered i got a rootbeer and was told thats all we've got. I hate rootbeer. My father in laws and fiances food was decent but they didnt get their correct drinks either.   I understand these things happen and sometimes it's out of your control but what is in control is how you handle the situation. You dont tell your customers sorry it's all we've got take it or leave it and you certainly don't have your employees laughing about the situation and commenting about how they can't believe this is the 3rd time this has happened.   If this has happened before i would hope that you would prepare and get some back up generators or something for emergencies like this and it would have been nice if the management gave us a coupon or some sort of discount for next time since we didn't even get what we ordered. Again i love this place and love the food normally. This was an unfortunate situation that was handled extremely poorly.",

Fries were good too although a little boring- they're crisp, crinkle cut, and salty.  Ultimately I did like this place and wouldn't hesitate to go back. It just wasn't the destination so many others talked it up to be.",

    "text": "This place is a great hotdog experience! Although there are other excellent choices on the menu, the best aspect of this restaurant is those great hotdogs. My favorite are the Jumbo Chicago style or the Jumbo chili- cheese dog! So delicious! The fries are some of the best I've had. Thick and crispy with an excellent flavor. Although I stay away from it, the chocolate cake is also a great attraction. It's a hybrid of a fast food and sit down. Built around the same system as In-N-out, you order at the counter then sit until your number is called out. Fast service and great for the whole family. Must do when in the Phoenix area.",

    "text": "I never realized what a Chicago dog was until I wandered into a Portillo's in downtown Chicago over 10 years ago. A decade removed from that memorable Portillo's dining experience, I made a beeline for this location as my first meal after my flight landed in Phoenix. The interior design of the Scottsdale location is way cool and very welcoming. The jumbo dog was as flavorful as I remembered it, and one of my dining guests who had never had a hot dog from Portillo's agreed with me that it's tasty and a few steps above your run of the mill hot dog. The burger was very average and forgettable, and not something I'd order again. The onion rings were perhaps some of the best I've ever had with a very flavorful & crunchy coating. I sampled some of the Portillo's chocolate cake one of the diners had ordered, but found the cake to be nothing special and the frosting a bit too sweet. They have a vast menu including a multitude of pastas, salads, and desserts, so I can't wait to try out some of their other menu items, but I know the dogs and onion rings are a must. Hopefully another decade doesn't pass by until my next Portillo's dining experience.",

We did have our dog with us and this place has a huge patio, you would like it would be appropriate for pet owners to bring their pups, but no. There was a sign on the door that clearly stated no dogs on patio. How disappointing!  The shake on the other had wasn't disappointing. It was really good and you get a decent amount for the price.

Try placing food in a tray?  Great food, wish we had better experiences.  The food here is by far the closest you will get to eating in Chicago!  Their salads are phenomenal as well as the hot dogs (of course).  The only problem seems to be getting the orders right...  Third time using the drive threw, and the third time the order was not correct after waiting over 20 minutes for the food. All in all, it's a great place to eat, but checking your order for accuracy is certainly a must when visiting this particular location.  Maybe a little review with the friendly staff and management may help fix this little issue.",

Sorry Portillos, your recipes have changed, as has the quality of your ingredients.  We both ordered the breaded chicken club sandwiches, which contained skimpy and small fried chicken-breast cutlets, which at best covered perhaps two-thirds of the small bun and included two thin pieces of undercooked bacon.  The crinkle cut fries were excellent! My wife thought the frozen strawberry shake was wonderful.  The noise level was unbearable.  A pulsating and very loud mix of music and voices disrupted my digestion.  We ate as quickly as possible in order to get out. The staff were efficient and friendly and kept the many tables cleared. Three stars are generous.  We probably won't return.",

We were not disappointed at all.  We felt like we were back in Chi-town!  The Italian beef was as great as ever, then I saw that they have a \"combo\" sandwich with Italian sausage & beef together!  So I asked my brother who lived in Chicago about this & he said that's all he ever gets!  So we came back a second time & I had that & OMG - it's heavenly!   I also had their chocolate cake shake!  Maybe it's the \"kid in me\", but it reminded me of when you were having cake & ice cream & you mix them together! One tip - when you order, hang close to the pick up counter, they DO NOT call order numbers in exact order & it's quite boisterous in there, so you can miss your number (which on the first visit, we did & I'm pretty sure someone took our order).  They quickly made it for us again, but lesson learned, the 2nd time, I stayed close & made sure to grab our order as soon as it came up!",

It's actually worse, as sometimes they'll make multiple mistakes, just to keep things interesting.   If you're eating at the restaurant, they'll fix the problem but certainly don't count on a good attitude about it, and don't expect an apology silly customer! If you're ordering at the drive through, you'd better unwrap and inspect your food before leaving to ensure you got what you ordered. Topping hot dogs is complicated stuff after all, apparently so is counting.  Food is OK, apparently brings back memories for Chicago transplants. But the unengaged, unhappy staff screams poor management that can't be overcome by any amount of nostalgic signs and photos and makes for a poor dining experience. Do yourself a favor and look at other Chicago style hot dog restaurants on Yelp, you'll find some that serve great food, with a great attitude, served by happy people who can both top hot dogs AND count !",

I had never heard of it before because I from Montreal. I had hands down one of the best beef sandwiches in my life. It had these tasty hot peppers too. I enjoyed the crinkle cut fries as well, very yummy (but very fattening!). Definitely a must have if you are around!",

My favorite dinner here is an Italian beef (prime roast beef, soaked in au jus type sauce) sandwiched between pillows of the softest bread imaginable and then dunked again into sauce. It's amazing, and messy, but mostly amazing.  Also, the cheese fries are de-lish. I normally am anti-fake-liquid-cheese, but this cheese is like a creamy bowl of macaroni and cheese sent from heaven to dip your perfect french-fries in; a dangerous combination!  The chocolate cake is delicious. I also love the chocolate cake shake -- chocolate shake with chocolate cake crumbles. Yum, yum, yum! Naomi Garnice gives it two thumbs up!!",

We enjoyed what we ordered, but I wouldn't drive more than 5 minutes to eat there.   I had a chopped salad, it was alright, the dressing was good, but too much of it. My hotdog bun was pretty much wet. Everyone said the was because it had been in a steamer or something... if this is what people in Chicago call a good hot dog, they must not get good food often. I guess the Italian Beef is what all the rage was about, but none of us partook in any of the beef sandwiches, maybe we will give it a whirl next time.   I also don't get the drive through right next to the patio like that..... yeah that's just what I want with my sandwich a lung full of exhaust fumes. Awesome!

Well.....the food was better than the place we left, but it was nothing special. I had a hot dog and was disappointed that they didn't use Vienna beef and that they did not have neon green relish....those two things are what make a Chicago style hotdog in my book. The BF enjoyed his cheeseburger, I thought it was pretty par as far as cheap cheeseburgers go. I definitely would not drive all the way out here to eat again, but I wouldn't refuse to eat here either, so I suppose it is ok.",

The people are friendly and the wait wasn't too long considering how packed it was.   We had a plain hot dog for my 2 year old, chili cheese dog with onions (sooo good), a bacon burger which was great just be careful not to leave it in the container it comes it mine got super soggy. Italian beef sandwich was also good pretty much anything we tried was great!   for dessert we got the chocolate cake and strawberry milk shake both were yummy!!   will definitely be coming back wish it was just 5 minutes away but worth the extra drive",

    "text": "Growing up in and around the Chicago area, I am ashamed to admit that it took this landmark eatery's expansion to Arizona for me to walk in the door.  The wife and I decided that our Sunday Fun-day wouldn't be complete without a Chicago Dog, Italian Beef and Rings...I should probably mention that we split a Chocolate Cake Shake too.  The employees are very \"Chicago\", filled with personality and attitude, all working for a seemingly competent and well managed organization to boot.  The interior was very clean, it appeared that they have numerous employees who's function it  is to quickly clean up tables as guests pick up their trays to depart.  Many other restaurants come to mind that should take note.  On to the food:  the Hot Dog was, well a Hot Dog.  Delicious in it's own right, but a Hot Dog nonetheless.  One discerning characteristic comes to mind, the poppy seed bun.  Fresh, almost spongy, not soggy.  Italian Beef was the best of recent memory, possibly knocking Mr.Beef (666 N Orleans St, Chicago IL) off of my #1 spot.  Ordered it wet with hot peppers.  Serving was proper, plenty of meat, bread that was moist and retained much of the Au Jus.  Purely Fantastic!  Onion Rings were delicious, not too thick,  the batter is unique in its texture, much crispier than I remember rings typically being.     Chocolate Cake Shake: two things I am not 1) A fan of chocolate 2) A fan of shakes. How can two things that I like so little, taste so good?  A must for all visitors.",

The beef was good, but I didn't really care for it in a croissant, as I prefer eating crispy, flaky layers, and not the soggy mess I had for lunch.

They even have soup and I love soup almost any time of year!  Staff pleasant and when they call your number this server put a little poetic twist based on the last number of your order. Clever. We chose to go outside. It was a beautiful day. Besides, while the music was great (loved the genre) it was terribly loud inside. You can hear the music outside but at a lower tone so you could hear each other talk. Not a True complaint because now I know I won't be a stranger just some constructive criticism. Maybe others are okay and I  am just an old fuddy duddy. Oh well. I can always get it to go if I want. They also cater so now another place to consider for an office lunch. I also noticed special Lenten sandwiches.",

My sister took me here because she knows I'm a fan of places that have a diner vibe to them. This place has some tasty food options. Lots to choose from. The staff was super friendly. We took a while to order but no one was behind us so it was all good!   I decided to get the mushroom burger with pasta salad. My sister ordered chicken fingers with onion rings. We both got shakes. She ordered the chocolate shake and I ordered the chocolate cake shake. Everything was AMAZING. The food was cooked in decent timing. My sister had to pick up her food at one counter where as I had to pick it up at another. Weird set up but that doesn't affect much.   The chocolate cake shake was weird but I couldn't stop drinking it. Everything was great and I would highly recommend this place to anyone who lives here and even those who come to visit. Can't wait to come back and eat here again!",

Nowadays it's just another place to eat. Heck, somedays I'd prefer McDonald's over them. Such a sad loss of quality.   Dipped sandwiches were dipped. And I mean held down and made soggy. The way they should be. Not anymore. Now if the sandwich touches the gravy it is momentarily at best. Dry, unwet bread that is just not the same.   I've talked to team members, hosts, assistant managers, managers, GM's, and even Directors based in Chicago. All offer the same lame apologies and promises to do better next time.   Nothing changes. No improvement. Zero.   I was once a Portillo's fanatic. Spending hundreds of dollars a month there. Now I barely go once a quarter and am still consistently disappointed with their quality.  \\_()_/  if it doesn't matter to them...",

You can order food in drive thru, get it delivered through door dash or go inside (lots of seating inside and outside on patio) and sit down for a meal. You order your food first and then wait until your number is called to pick it up at the counter.  I saw families, veterans, seniors, couples- all ages during my visit. This is a great place for everyone.  I got the classic Portillo's dog- it was just perfect and came with colorful toppings and the best dill pickle.  On the side I got onion rings- so crispy.

We have tried it three times and like the Cubs in most years, they struck out. The first time was to my office. We got the wrong order, so the delivery guy went back to get our order. I thought he was going back to Portillo's, he went back to where he dropped the wrong order and the brought it to us. We opened to find one sandwich with a bite out of it. GROSS.  Gave it another chance last week and after an hour it never showed and we had to cancel as daughter was hungry (delivered to wrong address) Third time was tonight and while our order was correct, it was cold and our \"large fries\" were half empty. Guess the driver was hungry. Anyways, Portillo's rocks, but their delivery partner is the WORST. Sorry, but Portillo's- you are out.",

Wrapped in foil and placed gently in a thick cardboard box made just for them which included extra sauce and a couple wet naps.

Atmosphere: there's a lot to see in this place, keep your eyes open and keep them constantly moving and you might see about 20% of everything that covers the walls and ceilings. It's really very cool, great casual vibe, colorful and visually stimulating. Because of the hard floors, large windows, wooden chairs and tables and other hard surfaces, it's kind of loud, but in a good, exciting, fun, upbeat way. The seating area is large, spacious and open, even though the place can get packed, there are plenty of seats and it can feel kind of fun to be sitting among the masses. If you're looking for a place to sit off to the side, you can usually find that also. But, it does depend on the time of day, this place gets packed. Of course, half of Chicago lives here, so what would you expect  (if confused, i'll explain, Portillo's is a Chicago institution)  Service: I have always found the service people here to be pretty friendly, you occasionally get the bland-human, but you'll find them occasionally everywhere. For the most part, the people behind the counters are either relatively friendly, smiling and taking your order, or running around like mad-men (and yes, mad-women), filling orders for the masses waiting in the dining area for their grub. It is kind of funny when the place really gets hopping and you see a single employee trying to manipulate lines of 40 and 50 people each waiting to order, a bit like herding cats and their frustration can be mildly amusing.  Food: I'm kind of a sucker for sticking with what I love, so for me, it's always Chicago hotdogs and fries. If you know you'll love it, why take a chance, right? Fortunately for me, I've been with plenty of other people who have ordered other things and their food always looks delicious and as I am eating their leftovers, I've always enjoyed them too . I find the food here excellent. It's high-quality, served fresh and temperature appropriate, large portions, great value and the taste is excellent. It's clear that ingredients are quality.  The business is clearly all about the food and the experience, a great thing!  Yup, I definitely recommend Portillo's. It's not going to be a first choice for a formal business meeting or coming here before prom or anything (although, how cool would that be???), but for just about any other \"eating out\" occasion, it's a terrific stop and you'll be glad you did.",

We have always had wonderful food and mostly good service util today. We placed our order which included a chopped salad. The lady at the salad counter was so freaking rude. We needed a  lid and she just ignored us. We ended up just reaching around and getting our own.  We also ordered cheese fries, which we always do, and they forgot the cheese. No big deal but they forget it 80% of the time. It's just annoying.  We also ordered plain iced tea. It was rancid. We took a sip and my husband and I just threw it away.   Also, I ordered the flounder sandwich. It was disgusting. I usually get the grilled tuna which I love but wanted to try something new, I'm so sorry I did.   We truly love Portillo's, we drove 40+ minutes just to go there. This trip was just so disappointing. When you look forward to some awesome food, it's a major let down when it sucks.",

Once he finally came on the line, his response was along the lines of \"oops, but you can get it next time.\" That's not okay, so I asked for better - like a gift card. Begrudgingly he agreed and promised to put one in the mail for a mere $10.  Two weeks later and nothing has arrived. Disappointing, sloppy customer service. Next time I'll go across the street to Chick-fil-A where the service is top notch - and the food great, too.",

At first I was delighted to be able to go to Portillos but I'm tired of over cooked hot dogs, wet buns, small portions of Italian beef and mistakes on my order.  It's still ok, but they screw up  so often and don't pay attention to details.  Check your order twice before you leave. Tonight I went and once again they messed up my order. Portillos is the single worst restaurant for takeout. EVERY order I place for takeout is wrong I've decided I'm going to take pics of my receipt and my order. Post them here for your viewing pleasure. But you know what really pusses me off? They never offer to pay for my dinner or offer any compensation. Tonight I asked them to remake my order, which the manager agreed too. Your customer service sucks",

Maybe I've been going to local restaurants too much but when I asked if they had military discount, stickers or WIFI the answer was a resounding NO. We ordered a full rib dinner, chicken caesar salad and drinks anyway.  How it went:  The Chicken Caesar Salad: Good, I mean crispy lettuce and all but the takeaway was it was a little dry.  The Full Rib Dinner: Very good. The sauce, different from what we're used to (it tasted lemon-based or something) but the meat was falling-off-the-bone delicious. The fries and baked potato were average good. The coleslaw side...I think KFC makes a better one. We split a strawberry shortcake for dessert; also nice. The strawberry shake I ordered was also good but not like I remembered in the past (but is ANYTHING the same as 20 years ago?).     Despite the negatives, we'll probably visit again if only to try the famous hot dog.     Worth checking out...again!",

It's nothing out of the ordinary, just standard comfort food (I.e burgers, pasta, fries, etc.). However even though the food is standard, the shakes are what blows everything out of the water.  If you haven't seen of or heard of the chocolate cake shake that they offer at Portillos, you need to head over and grab one for yourself ASAP! It's just as you imagine, a chocolate shake with bits of chocolate cake in it, and little pieces of icing and cream in every gulp. I'm not even that big of a fan of chocolate and I always get it when I go. If you're not even hungry and want a good shake, this is the place to go to! It's also a plus that they have a drive thru so you don't have to go down and place and order and wait for it to be made.   Food = 3/5 Shakes = 5/5",

I addition to hot dogs, I saw they had a pretty big salad set up (not just a token salad or 2), italian beef, different sausages, pasta, ribs, burgers, chicken sandwiches, chicken tenders...    I got a chili cheese dog (I know, right?!) and onion rings.  Both were great!  And I'll be back in the not so far future to try their other menu items.   It's a little confusing when you first walk in where to go.  Go all the way back to the corner by the salad station and order at the register.  Service is very friendly and helpful.  Food came out in just a few minutes.  They could use more tables inside because even though it wasn't very crowded most of the tables were full, but the tables were all clean and the place is kept up pretty nicely.    Portillo's is a welcome addition to this part of town as a reasonably priced place that has something for everyone.",

This is not once but FIVE times that I have got off work and tried to swing in at 9:45 and it's already closed down with the drive thru blocked by orange cones. I'm done trying.

If I hadn't said anything, they would have closed the restaurant and probably wouldn't have even asked if I was waiting for something. Granted, it was near closing time but it didn't make me feel any better that there were 10+ people behind the counter looking at their phones and shuffling around until quitting time. After I complained, all the manager could say is that he couldn't provide an explanation as to why my order was not acknowledged until I said something. Really? Maybe because you're not managing your people. He did offer me a piece of cake on the house to which I declined, but I'm sorry to say they lost me as a customer.",

After waiting 20 mins in the drive thru he drove another 22 miles home to realize they did not give us the extra peppers we paid for or the juice on the side for the beef. When I called and spoke with the manager about the situation his response was \"I don't know what you'd like me to do about it, I can't give them to you for free.\" The sandwiches are dry and tasteless without the juice. A waste of money. As a customer if my food isn't made the way I ordered it I expect it to be replaced. I don't drive 40 miles out of my way to find something to complain about so that I can get a free meal, I expect my food to be what I paid for. Which it wasn't. The manager did offer me a $10 gift card which would barely cover the cost of one sandwhich with extra peppers, not even the cost of gas to get me out there and back. What a joke. Very disappointed in how this well known company handles their mistakes.",

I'm an Italian beef sandwich whore.  I don't think I've met one that I didn't like. And now that this place is really close to work, I'm adding Portillo's to my dance card...  Yesterday a couple of folks from the office ordered takeout from there...I've been trying to be a good girl and avoid eating out everyday for lunch, but I finally broke down and said \"Yes\" to the mess.   I ordered an Italian beef sandwich with EVERYTHING (how do you know if you REALLY LOOOOVE your new beau if you don't get to know every nook and cranny?) with \"gravy\" on the side...bless their hearts, they put my grilled onions and mozzarella (all melty and seductive-like) on the sandwich to go and put my \"gravy\", giardiniera, and peppers on the side...BRILLIANT!   When I got my sandwich, it was P-E-R-F-E-C-T-oh, no sloppy, soppy mess that had been sitting or congealing for the 10 minute commute to tummy-town. I was able to decorate my vittles as I saw fit. The cheese fries were deliciously crispy crinkle cut fries that I was able to dip in the decadent, hot cheesy/jalapeno sauce. And to wash it all down? Sure I could've continued my quest for good-girl status and had water or a V8 but NO! I washed it down with a frosty, cold, bubbly root beer...and I was in heaven.",

We went there tonight and tell me why there are literally 3 guys walking around with rags with no clean tables?! We ended up sitting at a dirty table and wiped it down ourselves. While we were eating there was this really rude, ignorant worker/employee just opening and closing the trash while we were eating!! He was making it smell like hot garbage while we were eating! That's so effin gross! My fiance even told this nasty employee hey could you stop opening the trash a million times while we are eating here??!\" Then this guy just ignores the fact he said that and continues to do that! Like excuse me we just paid to go out to eat on a Friday night and he just made us have the worst experience! Also while we were first getting our food I seen this other employee mess with her nose and then gave me my bottled water! I'll honestly say I'll never come back to this establishment!",

So imagine my surprise while I was in Phoenix this past weekend to discover a brand new Portillo's right there in Scottsdale.  It's pretty much the same experience I have when in Chicago.  The staff was friendly and efficient which on my visit was definitely nice since the place was so busy.  Seriously, I realize it's new but I was surprised at the draw this place had.  In any case, the staff made the crowd much less of an ordeal than it could have been due to their organization.  So kudos to the management for good planning.  As to the food...well I of course had a hot dog and ordered it through the garden which is basically what we'd call a Chicago dog outside of Chicago.  Hot dog and veggies!  It's healthier that way right?  My friend and I also split an Italian beef sandwich which we ordered hot and dipped.  If you've never had this culinary delight, it's like a roast beef sandwich with some hot peppers and then the whole thing is soaked in the juice from the meat.  You may have to use a fork to eat it but your taste buds won't care!  It was all very tasty.   My friend who lives in Phoenix was sold and planned to go back again.  If i lived there, I'm certain I would be darkening Portillo's doors often too.  It's good food.   Really.  Go and enjoy!",

We had the beef and some Italian sausages with their bread, which was great too. We got some toppings for both like hot peppers and such.  Everyone was so pleased with the food and apparently they have a ton of other great stuff to try as well.  I will definitely go back here because of the food but how can you not after having such awesome service when you're such an idiot?",

    "text": "I really like Portillo's dogs and beef and tamales and even fries, but they must find a better way to package take out Chicago hot dogs. By the time you get them home, they are soggy and squished and disappointing.   Wrapping them in paper and throwing them in a bag with everything else just does not do them justice.  It works ok for Beef sandwiches which are juicy any way, but even they would be better if packaged to go better.",

    "text": "My wife, daughter and I braved the lines and the cold to be here on opening night. We met up with a great group of Yelpers for Georgie's UYE. Thankfully, those aforementioned Yelpers had saved us a spot in the INCREDIBLY long line. I mean, seriously...I think I overhead people speaking of their wait time in hours...plural. That's ridiculous. I don't know that I've ever seen people that excited for a hot dog.  While we waited, we witnessed the amazing employees making their way through the crowds (both in the parking lot waiting to get in, as well as the seemingly endless lines of cars making their way through the drive-thru). Portillo's DEFINITELY has their stuff together when it comes to managing the masses.   After our sojourn through the crowds, we finally made it inside. By this time, we had already chosen our food, and were just waiting to make it to the register. That gave us quite a bit of time to take in the sights. Now, being that I'm not from Chicago, I had to lean heavily on my great company for authenticity. According to the two greatest kings this city has known, Portillo's definitely gets an A+ in that department. Apparently, each Portillo's has it's own special theme. This one has a 50's retro vibe. After all...retro is cool again. Go figure.  As I've mentioned before, I'm not a HUGE fan of hot dogs. They're alright, they're just not my favorite. My wife and I each got the Supreme dog...which we thought would be...I don't know, supreme, I guess. Ultimately, it was sizable, but for something to be called \"supreme\",  I guess I just expected a lot more. It wasn't much bigger than the Ballpark Franks you can buy at the grocery store. It probably didn't help that my hot dog was on a table next to a GARGANTUAN beef sandwich. Talk about buyer's remorse...but, I digress.  For me, the best part of this place was the dessert. We ordered the Chocolate Cake Shake. I thought it would just be a chocolate shake that magically tasted like chocolate cake. Little did I know, they actually take a piece of some of the richest chocolate cake I've ever tasted, mix it with ice cream, and stir it all up. If ever there was a dessert that made me want to immediately get tested for diabetes, this was it. It was SO thick! I ended up having to eat the last bits of it with a spoon. This shake is definitely a game changer!  If you're a Chicago native (which there seem to be a lot of out here), then you'll undoubtedly love this place. If you're a hot dog enthusiast, you'll probably like it, too. If you don't really like hot dogs, then what are you doing here in the first place?  And if you love an AMAZING chocolate cake shake, then you'll DEFINITELY love it!",

    "text": "Pretty great food. It's really just popular for being the chain it is. It's a little chaotic and always full, but it's a great experience. I've tried quite a few of the items and been here multiple times, so here are my reviews for them. Chili cheese hotdog: Great! Chock full of cheese, chili, and onions. The hotdogs are great quality and the buns are soft, and delicious. Make sure to get the jumbo size! Definitley a lot bigger, but not too much more expensive.  Regular Hotdog: Just okay. I guess I'm not fans of any chicago dogs, but on the bright side, the thing was very full!  Italian Beef: MMMM!! What can I even say? The first bite was a little weird, but as I kept eating, it got more and more amazing!! The beef is perfectly cooked, and almost buttery tasting, and has a little kick of heat. THe flavor is seriously amazing, and bread compliments it perfectly. And for those who complain it's soggy, it's dipped in the juices! If you don't like it, ask for it \"Dry\"   Cheese Fries: The fries are quite generic, but they're cooked perfectly crispy, and the inside is very soft. The cheese, as always, is great.  Burgers: They're pretty great. But why would you order a burger at Portillos? Good, but not recommended unless you're not a fan of anything else here.  Chopped Salad: Pretty good. But still, not worth it.  It has a very unique flavor and a nice sweet tang. Probably not worth getting again.  Chocolate cake shake: Just okay, great for chocolate lovers, but too sweet in my taste.  Overall, if you're a hotdog fan and looking for a great hotdog in the valley, this is defintley recommended. I also recommend the italian beef. One thing about this place is that it can add up to be a bit pricey if you order a few things.",

    "text": "\"Hot Dog\" is in the name and I am only going to Review the Hot Dogs.  Here I am going to \"go against the grain\" with a mediocre Review of a New Restaurant receiving mostly good Reviews.  Okay, so maybe I am a \"Hot Dog Snob\" from the East Coast, where everyone knows there is only one brand of Hot Dog that can stand up to being boiled instead of grilled. (The \"Dirty Water Dog\" is the Sabrett brand, in Natural Casing).  In fairness to this new location and because I love Hot Dogs I tried three varieties:                          With everything! (The Chicago way)                          With Mustard and Relish only (My favorite)                           Chile Cheese Dog  Let me say, the \"Toppings\" are terrific. The problem is with the Hot Dog itself. Far too mild, no beefy taste (Bordering on no taste), overwhelmed by the toppings and with very little \"snap\" when biting into it.  Probably in the minority, but just NOT as good as the size of the Restaurant and the reputation would indicate.  Ted's is still the \"Hot Dog Of Choice\" in Phoenix and they are from Buffalo, New York.   Willing to venture to Maricopa for the BEST BOILED HOT DOGS EVER (Sabrett)? If so, go to Al's Dogs located next to O'Reilly Auto Parts on John Wayne in Maricopa. Better call first to be certain they are open: (520) 357-3647",

Portillos got our order wrong, asked me to turn off my camera when I was filming (I take 1 second every day for my year video scrapbook), charged for ranch (dumb!), and all for mediocre food. We had the chicken club and italian beef. Add in some fries, some drinks, and a piece of cake = $40. Uh...no?   They have a sign that basically puts down other restaurants that don't have glass panes peering into their kitchen/prep areas.  Two stars because in general, the staff was very friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed the chocolate cake. The cheese sauce with french fries was good too- same stuff I used to get from the high school cafeteria.  Overall: I like Johnny Rockets better. Same type of food without the crowds.",

I often feel rushed when I get in line to order because they have a person carrying a notepad or something taking our order as we stand in line, so I don't really get to peruse the menu to see what I want - an option is to get out of line to read the menu, but considering how busy it is, you need to stand in line, get your order and hope to get a table to sit at.  I'm not a HUGE hot dog fan, so I usually just order the \"hot dog\". It comes with everything including: mustard, relish, freshly chopped onions, sliced red ripe tomatoes, kosher pickle and sport peppers piled onto a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun.  The best part is the poppy seed bun. So soft and warm!  They also have crinkle fries that are also really good.  I'd definitely keep coming back to this place as there are many other things on the menu that I want to try.",

Sure there are places around the valley to go get a Chicago dog or beef, but Portillos has them all beat hands down.  I got the Italian beef dipped with hot and sweet peppers on top, my wife had their hot dog, and we both had their crinkle fries.  This food was so freakin good, it's like we were back in the windy city.  We went on opening day, and the line was out the door, and wrapped though the parking lot.  This didn't phase us, as the food is well worth the wait.  I cant estimate how many people were standing in line, but it took us about 1.5 hours to get our food.  The staff at Portillos were on top of it though! Tables were being cleaned as fast as they were being filled, cooks were sending out food as fast as possible, and all employees had very positive attitudes.  Bottom line: Awesome food & great service! I cant wait to go back!",

I've read some reviews by people who claim they don't understand the hype - don't order a salad! (Their chop salad is, however, delicious)  You gotta get the beef dipped with sweet peppers.  Some go for cheese, but honestly I think that just takes away from the amazingness of the beef itself.  I guess I'm pretty simple.   A helpful tip to avoid the crazy crowd:  go right when they open!  That's what we did and it was easy breezy and quiet.  Late \"breakfast\" or an early lunch - if you don't want to wait it out in the long lines, get there as early as possible.  We got there at 11am and it was getting pretty crowded by 11:30. It's worth it.  Having a Portillo's here means one less thing on my To-Do list when I go home to visit! Love it!",

    "text": "Well let me start by saying the location is more than a notion being located right of the Expressway and at the Corner of 90th and Shea. Traffic is going to a nightmare and getting out of there is going to be an even bigger nightmare especially on weekends...you can count on it. However with all of that being said it is definitely worth the trouble. This was the second opening day event I went to today (First being Krispy Kreme which I will review later) and I have to say the owners of this establishment  \"NAILED IT\"....wohoooo. I don't miss many things about Chicago during the 10 years I stayed there....but Portillo's was definitely one of them. The chopped salad was in a word DELICIOUS and I was hoping it would be the same way here in AZ. After waiting for a year for this place to open I was not disappointed. The staff was awesome....the drive-thru was fully staffed and not a single person was waiting out there. The outdoor seating is a bit close to the entrance and right next to the drive thru lane so they might want to look into other options with that.  Back to the Chopped Salad.....as I said before just like in Chicago.....they NAILED IT. However the lady that was making them today seem to have trouble with special orders. I ordered 2 chopped salads one with no bacon.....and one with no cheese....she managed to mess that up REALLY. I didn't hold that against her or the establishment because it was opening day...but if it happens in the future they will lose a star on this review. The prices were also dead on and the establishment itself made me feel like I was in Chicago for at least a few minutes anyway. I think the people that moved here from Chicago like myself will be very pleased and for the newbies.....well I think their dining options will change once they visit Portillo's.  Warning....Warning....Warning....to Chili's......Applebee's .....Mimi's Cafe....Quiznos and Culver's......there is a new kid on the Block and it's name is PORTILLO'S....WATCH OUT....WOHOOOO.

I'm not from Chicago, from good ol' Arizona. I had the sausage w/ Italian beef and hot peppers (pics posted) along with onions rings. Line was a bit hectic about fifty people in front of me but it goes by fast. The food was so amazing after I ate my sausage Italian beef sandwich inside, I then walked to my truck and waited in the drive through for more. Don't judge me its THAT GOOD!! Thank you baby Jesus for Portillos!!",

    "text": "What an experience - that's all I can say after a recent trip to the new Portillo's in Scottsdale!  We decided to brave the crowds on a Saturday afternoon before a spring training game.  Thanks to an early game we got a good start at Portillo's around 11AM, which I think SOMEWHAT helped with the crowds.  Thankfully we found a parking spot quickly and hurried into the line that was already outside the door.  Inside was PACKED and a bit overwhelming for a person who isn't too keen on crowds.  After placing our order one person in our party stayed in line to pay and two of us looked for a seat.  It took a good 10 minutes walking back and forth to finally get a seat.  People were pushing and shoving the whole time - not fun.  Once we finally were sitting and our food was received, we all calmed down and scarfed our food.  I had a hot dog, which was fab.  I really enjoyed it!  The fries were great as well... only wish we would have gotten more!  The Hubs had an italian beef sandwich and we really liked it.  He got it plain and said next time he wants peppers for sure.  We all really enjoyed the food here, though the crowds were CRAZY!  Not sure it will get any better anytime soon, but perhaps in the future when I am brave again we will give this place a second go around.  For now, I will wait to see if the masses die down.... I doubt they will!",

I'd recommend trying to grab a menu before getting in line, since it's hard to see the one of the board behind the registers while you're waiting. Plus, you don't want to be the old guy holding up the line while you're making your decision at the register.   After ordering, head to the left to wait for your order number to be called (probably in the form of a rhyme). THEN, you can get a seat. Otherwise, you're the old guy hogging up a table for 6 while people with their food are standing to eat.  The hotdogs are delicious. My boyfriend got the sausage sandwich and loved it. Very tasty place if you can navigate it!",

Then when I walk back up the girl tells me I asked for different hotdogs. I asked for what I ordered and what was on my receipt. No one apologized. I got frustrated and walked to the cashier and asked for my money back. I said I'd pay for the burger and fries my girlfriend ate but not the hotdogs.   What made me mad was no manager took responsibility or tried to make it right. All I got was grief from the employees for their mistakes. Sad to say but I'll never go back.",

It was dripping all the way through the paper and made the French bread very soggy. The meat does taste good but it was still too plain for me, despite how it was drenched in oil. French fries were too salty. I do like the poppyseed salad though. And the poppyseed muffin that came with the salad was good. I guess if you're like me and you don't like fast food, you probably wouldn't like this place. It's way too unhealthy.

He invited me by the shop, and I since I worked in North Scottsdale, I was more than willing to oblige.  It took him a moment to remember seeing me from the night before, but  after a moment It clicked. He recommended that I order the Italian Beef sandwich with peppers and mozzarella. Dipped in \"the gravy\". That shit was good.  I also got the crinkle fries. Standard salty french fries. Them shits was good.   The place was a madhouse. infinity people everywhere.

The place is run like a machine, with quick ordering, and fast delivery of your food. The prices are on par with other restaurants with similar fare.  I almost always get the same thing, a jumbo dog and fries, but it's consistently good. My only complaint. I grew up eating this kind of food, and miss the famous hand-cut style french fries from Chicago. Their's taste like they are right out of the giant frozen bag.  The place is jumpin, but there's plenty of places to sit, and lots of room for big parties. They also sell their food in bulk so you can have a \"hot-dog\" party at your own house ( :",

Thank you for the friendly service.  ________________ Previous review: I am very sadden to write this review. My dad was so excited to take me for lunch here but I was so disappointed in my meal. I ordered to go and had no choice but to eat it. I don't think its an issue with the company but more of how the cooks are trained. I know this is more of a meat eater place and as a vegetarian I was thrilled to read about your grilled veggie, man it sounded SOOOO good.   When I got to open the sandwich I was so heartbroken at what I saw. The veggies were really over cooked, I honestly couldn't identify two of them. They were soggy, brown, and just not very tasty. The buns were soaked from the overcooked wet veggies it was almost inedible for me. I got through one half and just felt sick.   A positive was the employees were very friendly and welcoming and the fries were so yummy and crispy.   I will try this place again but maybe stick with a salad :c",

They offer free refills on drinks if you ask at the window.  The service is fast and friendly serving a lot of folks. I would recommend this for anyone and great for groups.",

Our cashier was Merry, but her face said a different thing, She was through and precise.  I had two Chicago dogs and better half had the Italian Beef Sandwich which she said was very good. It must have been, because she devoured the whole sandwich. We ordered french fries and onion rings, but after tasting the onion rings, I should have ordered a large. The coating and texture was beautiful and the crunch was amazing, not too hard and not too soft. Betcha' can't eat just one.  We were both satisfied and looking forward to our next visit.",

    "text": "My buddy Dave G. recently wrote an updated review on Portillos.  There are like a gazillion transplants from Chicago out here in AZ, so they have 2 of them.  After reading his review, it made me realize that the last time I was there (Buena Park), I left a bit disappointed.  I wanted to go see a movie that was close by, so I decided to stop and get some lunch.  Redemption?  Yes!  I got there early at like 10:40am.  There were maybe 5 other people in the joint.  I walked up and placed my order for a Jumbo Dog with mustard, onions and relish, a Maxwell Street Polish, a Large Cheese Fries, and a Large Diet Coke.  My total was just under $12.00.  Not the cheapest lunch, but it was substantial and kept me full most of the day.  I paid the lady my money and then took a seat.  A few minutes later, they called my number and I picked up my order.  Here is how everything tasted...............  Jumbo Hot Dog-  Delicious!  I didn't go full Chicago style on this one.  I'm not the biggest fan of tons of toppings.  Mustard, onion and sometimes relish and I am a happy man.  This dog was great!  It was large, plump and beefy!  It was encased in a soft, steamed poppyseed bun and then topped with mustard, onions and plenty of neon green relish.  I really liked the dog and for the .34 cents more than a regular dog, it is well worth going with the jumbo.  Pretty much a must order every time here.  Maxwell Street Polish-  The last time I had this I was extremely disappointed.  The onions were too watery, the bun was soggy and the sausage didn't taste that great.  This time around it was better than last time, but not as good as it could have been. The caramelized onions they use are plentiful, but they destroy the bun.  They soften it up too fast.  The Polish sausage itself was a bit lacking too.  It wasn't that flavorful and had a weird texture.  They skimped on the mustard too.  I ate the whole thing and it wasn't \"bad\" per say, but give me a Teds Polish any day of the week over this thing.  I doubt I will order it again.  I would get 2 Jumbo Dogs instead.  Large Cheese Fries-  These are probably my favorite thing here!  Whatever it is, their cheese sauce is just fantastic.  Its piping hot, creamy and it sticks to the fries perfectly.  They use a crinkle cut fry here and they are fried and salted nicely.  A quick dunk in the molten cheese and you have yourself a winner.  Their fries are in the same pricing scheme as their dogs.  A small fry is only like .20 cents less than a large.  Why even get a small?  For .20, you get way more fries.  The cashier was friendly and the guy that gave me my food was cheery.  They still aren't my favorite hot dog in AZ (Teds holds a special place in my heart), but a jumbo dog and some cheese fries are a guaranteed winner!  This visit redeemed my faith in Portillos and I'm sure I will be back soon enough!   Thanks for planting the seed, Dave G ;-)",

If i want a hot dog, I'll go to Ted's in Tempe and if I want a beef I'll go to Rosati's at Warner and McClintock since it's not a franchise.

The large fries were not that large (ok maybe I am getting spoiled by Five Guys).  Thought the Italian beef could have used something else, I did get the peppers added, but they should also include grilled onions.  BUT, they FORGOT the gravy on the side  for the Italian beef.  And this after I ordered it, and even read back the order when we picked it up, and confirmed that they included with the order.  And when we got home, NO gravy (I think they got confused, as we ordered cheesy fries, and probably thought that was the gravy).  How can you have an Italian beef without the gravy.  Very disappointed that they forgot it.  Take out is easy, very friendly staff.  Next time, will double check the gravy.",

Tried the Chocolate Cake Shake and fries which were all tasty. Will be back to try other items. One thing is when ordering, have all the items with everything the way it is suppose to be.",

You'd think hot dogs would be mostly idiot proof, but it's honestly hard to find a good one when eating out. The burger was pretty good as well. I ordered a small cake shake and only got through about a third of it, but it tastes exactly like you would imagine. Also, Chynna, who took our order was very nice and helpful in answering our questions. She's also great at making you want to try everything on the menu. Hit this place up if you want a good hot dog, I plan on going back.",

So for a place you can sit down and feel comfortable. We ordered two hog dogs and a charbroiled chicken sandwich. The hot dogs were unremarkable. The chicken sandwich was good but the toppings and bread did nothing to aide in the flavor. I ended up pulling the chicken out and eating it by itself. Overall I'm not bashing the place, after leaving here I was already looking forward to my next meal.",

If you go to get the hotdog, spend the little extra to get the Premium/Jumbo dog. Its the same bun and fixings, but the meat quality is like the difference between Nathan's and a highschool cafetera. In my opinion they should stop offering the standard quality hot dog and just go all out on the jumbos. They aren't doing themselves any justice by trying to pass off that crappy tube of animal product as food. For some reason the two dogs are just that different!",

Taking down the restaurant decor for a very open counter service restaurant. Akin to something like Five Guys, you can view the entire line of cooks from grill to tray service along half the perimeter. They even have a separate counter for serving desserts.   The title suggests hot dogs is the main attraction, but from what everyone's been ordering and what the staff tells me, the Italian beef attracts the most customers. The gravy is excellent, and the beef while succelent embodied all the classic flavors every Italian beef fan loves. The bread does the sandwich justice, but it's good but not great. I personally like the combo, which comes with an entire sausage in addition to the beef.  The sides are not something to shirk at either. The onion rings are super crispy and the crinkle fries work well with dat cheese whiz.   To top everything off, this entire restaurant even has a drive thru, which totally works!  The menu is huge, so I'm far from exhausting my limit here. I hear the salads are pretty good, and I've got to try the namesake dish eventually. However, it's really hard to stay away from the Italian beef every time I come back.",

The food is awesome and just as good as the Portillo's that I remember in Chicago. Although the parking lot was packed when I got there, there was pretty much no line to order and the food here is cranked out very quickly. You can even watch them make your food in the window to the left of the cashiers. Their combo italian beef/sausage sandwiches are to die for. I can't wait to come back here next time I'm in the area. Who knows, if I have a craving I might even drive down from Vegas just to eat here!",

Cheap, good eats and an authentic Chicago Dog.  My father-in-law spent decades loving the Italian Beef sandwiches.  Prices are very good for the amount of food.  Truth is there is a lot of hype associated with Portillo's coming to the Phoenix area from folks with Chicago roots.  It's a classic and old-time fave.  Food is yummy and authentic, but nothing remarkable compared to your places with innovative chefs.  Um, it's also not considered health food.  (Just FYI. :o))  The drive thru process may also throw people the first time.  I had forgotten how unusual it is-- order with a person who walks your car to the cashier person who then send you up to the food deliverers.    Regardless, I love that Portillos and Chicago Hamburger Co are here to fill the need for authentic Chi-town fare.",

    "text": "I was in Chicago recently and went to the downtown location for a quick meal. I had the Italian beef and a friend had a hot dog.  I regretted not coming back to try a hot dog but, after learning there was a Portillo's in Scottsdale, I figured I'd get one back home.  And I did.  I went here with the same friend. The restaurant's interior looks a lot like the Portillo's in Chicago except it's smaller and newer. This is one of those, walk up to a counter and place your order and then wait until your number is called along with something clever that rhymes with your number, \"43 come and see me\" (the woman in Chicago was much better, the guy in Scottsdale just didn't have his heart in it). You then sit in their large seating area.   My friend got the Italian beef and I got a jumbo hotdog with everything.  Some comparisons - the Italian beef I got in Chicago was tasty but it was was very wet. I mean, running down your arm when you picked it up wet. The Italian beef here was moist but wasn't dripping.  The hotdog was OK. This was my first Chicago-style dog so maybe I just didn't know what to expect. It's a fat beef hotdog with mustard and there are sliced onions, pickles, peppers, etc just laying in the bun along with the hotdog. It was good, just not what I was used to.  My friend said she preferred the Italian beef over the hotdog she got in Chicago. I concur.  On the plus side - $20 for an Italian beef, a jumbo hotdog, a shared side of onion rings and two soft drinks! Nice deal.",

I think all their sandwiches are excellent as well (Italian Beef, polish sausage, etc.).  Only thing I do not recommend is their burgers...but in Chicago no one goes there for the burgers!  I do admit, I think the hotdogs have gotten slightly smaller, but the flavor is still there.  Pure Vienna beef....mmm mm mmm.  I haven'd had any bad service issues. As packed as this place normally is, they literally have never messed my order and they are very fast.  Their chain of communication in the food prep line is amazing.  Makes me wonder how food gets messed up between 2 people at other restaurants.  The food selections are endless, the menu is huge.",

Between everyone in our group, we had italian beef, hot dogs, cheeseburger, a salad, and chicken fingers for the kids. The general consensus- its good. Is it worth the drive from Gilbert? probably not. The prices are good, they move people through at a fast pace so even if the line seems long it moves pretty quickly. I think that there are other places out there who do hot dogs and italian beef just as well, its more the experience that makes Portillo's special.",

After the 2nd time though, I think it's a tad overpriced for all the fanfare. And, yet we have another fast food joint, made to be a restaurant, where you have to pick up your own food.   Note to all restauarnt owners... If I want to pay high prices for food, bring it to me! I don't want to stand in line, I don't want to wait for my name to be called, just bring the damn thing to my table. Hell... Even Carl's Jr. brings your order to where I am sitting. I'm not lazy. It's just stupid to pay restaurant prices for fast food, in a sense. It's not that often I crave a chili dog. But I can grab a can of Hormel's chili for a buck, and package of hot dogs for 2 bucks, and with cheese and inions, I can feed myself and 4 friends for about a buck each. What's the difference between my deal and this place? About Ten Frickin' Dollars I tell ya'. I can get a better hot dog at Costco, thank you very much. Won't be returning.  And all you people from Chicago... Always talking about your town... Selling out the Diamondback games when your beloved Cubs are in town... Welcome Chicago to the Desert, etc. etc. Why did ya'all leave, and why are you here, if it's such a gosh-darn great town?????????",

    "text": "I don't know what to think of this place. I mean, I really do like it (I'm giving it 4 stars), but it's not what I was expecting. I had heard SO MUCH about Portillo's before going, but despite that I didn't realize it's basically glorified fast food (and I don't mean that in a bad way at all). For some reason I thought it was more like casual dining.  Anyway, I've been here a few times since I recently started going to a new doctor in this area & I've really liked what I've had. I will say, I got things that probably aren't the most popular items, which actually probably speaks to how good this place is (my dad always gets the chili cheese dogs w/grilled onions & LOVES them). I've had the chicken tenders, grilled chicken sandwich, and beef on a croissant, all of which were yummy. I also LOVE the cheese fries. The fries are crinkly & I like that cheese is on the side. I also tried the chocolate cake & brought home the strawberry shortcake on my last visit. The chocolate cake was VERY rich, but it was a huge slice. I really LOVED the Italian style shortcake, though.    This place is a really weird place to dine in at. I do like that they are kind of old school when you place your orders. They write it down as you order and call it out to the back over a microphone before ringing it up. I think this makes for less mistakes, especially on orders that aren't as exactly as the item(s) are on the menu. However, I do wish they had a soda fountain where you could serve yourself. It's nice to grab your drink immediately while waiting for your order (it also makes it easier for refills). They also serve you your food here as if everything is takeout (bagged up) whether your dining in or not. It's not a big deal, but it seems like kind of a waste to bag up food, rather than just place it on a tray if your gonna dine-in.  The few times I've been here have always been late afternoons (right after the lunch crowd), and although things have been pretty busy the wait to order & for food isn't bad. From what I understand though this place gets PACKED at peak hours.   All in all I really like Portillo's, and think it's a good, \"different\" fast food place to stop by and grab a bite to eat at when in this area.",

The food was good and served very quickly, but not having been there before its a bit disconcerting to have them ask for your order before you even reach the point where you can read the signs.   Of course, not being from Chicago, I had never heard of Portillo's before this opened and while it was good, it's basically a hot dog and Italian beef sandwich shop. Are they good hot dogs? Sure. Are they worth a long wait in line? If you're not from Chicago, probably not. Will I go back? Probably, but I wouldn't make a special trip.",

    "text": "After shopping at Fry's, my husband and I decided to grab dinner at Portillo's. We had never been to a Portillo's previously and wanted to try it.  We contemplated parking and going in or using the drive-thru. We saw several employees standing outside with headsets and such; we were concerned something was wrong with the telecom system that most drive-thru places use. We decided to chance it and use the drive-thru.   When we pulled up, a friendly employee greeted us and asked to take our order. We explained that this was our first time, so she handed us two menus. I decided to get the chili cheese dog and my husband decided on the Maxwell Street Style Polish dog. We both decided on onion rings. The employee told us to drive around and pay at the second window. Again, there were several employees outside waiting to take our money and hand us our food. They were all very friendly so I asked why they were standing outside. Apparently this is what they do! All day, every day - unless it's really busy and not efficient to do so. Call me crazy, but this was totally bizarre to me. It was a very hot day, but AZ can get scorching during the summer. Let's hope they are inside on those days!   Our food was prepared quickly and we took it home to enjoy. My chili cheese dog was really good - everything was flavorful and the bun was soft. I had a bite of my husband's and it was really good too! I couldn't decide which I liked better. The onion rings were good but I probably wouldn't order them again. (They had more bread than onion - the ratio was off.)   Looking through the menu more closely, they have a lot of items to choose from. I'll definately be back to try more!",

It's simply convenient -- close to home and you get your food quickly since you order at a register and then pick it up at the counter.  Ambiance is zero inside, and the outside patio features car fumes.  The roast beef sandwich and meatball sandwich are probably their best items.  The rest - average.  The fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings are all just ok or maybe a bit less.  The hot dogs are fine, but try making them Sonora style and you might have something.  If you are passing by and are hungry and are willing to spend about $10 for a sandwich and fries, Portillo's will do.",

They are primarily known for their hot dogs (chili cheese!!) and Italian Beef sandwiches.  NO, the beef is not a cheesesteak. This isn't Philly.    The fries are old school and the cheese is REAL, not 'orange'.  I'm a huge fan of the Chocolate Cake Shake.. think chocolate shake with cake in it. Sounds gross.. tastes great.    I mix it up time to time and I recently got a burger there.  My hangover craved it.  Hand made and hand pressed, and grilled to perfection.  POrtillo's is delicious and unhealthy food.

I don't even know if I should really be reviewing it under the same umbrella because this new trend of taking quality sit down Midwestern food (Steak n Shake, etc.) and turning it into... well, whatever on the west coast is disturbing.   Where to start, well for one every time I've been there they've gotten mine or someone else's order wrong. The burgers are not what I remember, some flavorless non-juicy knock off. The shakes taste worse than fast food syrup concoctions sitting out overnight and the hot dog is sub-par at best. I am all for people enjoying whatever they want but I respectfully think you're wrong. In addition, there's something about the onion rings in that every time I order them they don't agree with me in a way I don't experience else where.   Although, on the bright side, usually the cashiers are very pleasant, patient and suggestive. The deco is alright as well. However the wait is fairly long, I remember this from before but I figured I'd get the same quality. The outside area is very nice but on several attempts some staff has attempted to take my food... I don't know why, hyper eager preemptive cleaning?",

People were starting to clear out, but the lobby and seating area was still packed.   The decor was interesting and comfortable. This operation is very fast paced as Nydia mentioned in her review. What I like about the layout is you can see them preparing your food and it appears extremely well maintained, clean and organized.   Update 1/2/14: Jumbo chili dog with grilled onions is messy and not much to brag about. The itailan beef was good, but not sure I agree with the masses on this one.",

And I don't even have to catch a flight to Chicago!   My heart started beating faster as soon as I walked in. The anticipation for the Portillo's Dog had me smiling giddily, like a little school girl on Puppy Day. Is Puppy Day a thing? If not, it should be.  The hot dog was great, just like it was in Chi-Town. I'm no hot dog expert, but these are still the best I've ever had.   If you don't like hot dogs, there are plenty of other offerings. The Italian beef sandwich is Great, tender beef, and dipped in gravy to your liking (Dry-light gravy, Extra gravy or totally Dipped in gravy). I like the beef sandwich with sweet peppers added, and I don't really even like peppers.   They also have chicken sandwiches, fish sandwiches, a veggie sandwich, burgers and even..... salads.   Most importantly, if you do like hot dogs... you have to get here as soon as possible to do work... Joey Chestnut style.",

Cheese fries, burger and chicken sandwich and tenders are all average. Service can be slow though, it's hit or miss here. I will say the chocolate cake is amazing... if you order one thing here it should be that.   Inside, you order towards the back left corner. You get a number and head back towards the front of the building, where you wait for your order to be called. It can be pretty chaotic at peak hours or if you have someone calling numbers quietly.   The drive thru at lunch time is kind of a mystery to me. Sometimes they have someone outside to take your order, sometimes you just talk to the speaker. Sometimes you pay and get your food at the first window, sometimes you drive up to the second to get your food. Just pay attention and listen to any directions they give you.   Maybe I just don't get the hype cause I don't eat hot dogs or other stuff? Either way, could be worse.",

You order your food on a line, and someone is taking your order before you even get to the register, and writing it on a paper bag. They give you an order number and call it when your items are ready. I didn't like that the salads and sandwiches were picked up in different places. They were using a speaker to call the numbers for sandwiches, but for salads they were just calling out, and we couldn't hear a thing since we were clear across the restaurant.   The food itself was a mixed bag for us. My husband liked his Italian Steak sandwich. The crinkle cut fries were simple and good. I absolutely despised my apple walnut chicken salad. The chicken was chewy, and COLD.   I should go back and try a burger or a dog, and maybe I will on a future visit, but I don't want to spend anymore time here this weekend since the salad was so disappointing.",

When trying to check it, the window cashier was quick with attitude  about my holding up a line (that I  had  waited in as well) so I could check. Sure enough half the order was missing. Her answer was \"good thing we could fix it\" not even a lame I'm sorry..... I didn't even realize how much was missing, things I paid for, until returning home.

Topped it off with a strawberry short cake lots of cake, berries and whipped cream. Plenty big enough to share for two.  Lots of room but it fills up quickly. Little noisy but there's a lot going on.

Paid for an extra gravy. Now let's see, that's two gravies plus one... I should have three gravies. Got one cheese fry and paid for an extra cheese. Now that makes two cheese sauces right. Get to the second window and I ask the man, now theres 3 gravies in the bag and two cheese right... oh yep you got it, 3 gravies and two cheese... I take the bag and double check and NOPE,  they are missing a gravy. After I literally just asked him. Either he couldn't count, or he didn't even double check the order. So now I have to sit at the window and honk until I get someone's attention. Then he takes what seems like forever to get the gravy, that they forgot, while my food is sitting getting cold.

Considering the time of day and how packed it was we had no problem finding a seat and the line to order moved quickly.  Our food was also ready within a reasonable time.  This location is really spacious and the environment is nice.  The place is heavily decorated, there is a lot to see in there! The cheeseburger and fries that I ordered were delicious!! And the chocolate cake was on point as well!",

The food is always fantastic and I've eaten probably half of the menu and the chocolate cake shakes are absolutely fabulous and a must have every time I'm there. I don't normally eat crinkle fries, but these are so darn good I can't pass them up!  Please build one in Goodyear or Buckeye!!!",

First someone put me on hold and never came back, 2nd time no one answered and 3rd time I finally had a wonderful sounding employee named Laura answer and help me with my order both professionally and efficiently. Thought it was going to be smooth sailing from there until I got in the pick up line which was long and slow and it wasn't any better inside. I was now waiting 15 minutes in the line and because I had time I decided to add two cake shakes to my order once I got closer to the front and saw an employee delivering the food to the cars. Asked him if I could do that, it was no problem, just had to get some other employee to take my payment (why?). Finally got to the front and cars behind me were getting their orders and pulling out. I'm now at the front and no one has come to take my money. Asked if my food was ready and if so, just forget the shakes..my food has probably been sitting up there as long as I have been waiting. Food was ready, employee seemed relieved that I didn't wait for the shakes. This is not even snowbird season yet so I'm going to have to decide if I'll just hold off visiting again until May.",

We ordered the Grilled Tuna sandwich and the Grilled Vegetable sandwich - both great!! These aren't just token non-meat items - they're really tasty!!  The tuna was the perfect drive-thru fish sandwich - tender and yummy, served on a small, fresh bun  (not fried, not gross!!). The veggie was a generous portion on fancy bread - lovely fresh grilled vegetables, Havarti cheese and nothing else! So healthy and tasty!   The people who work here obviously take pride in providing excellent, friendly service. Door greeting, directions, order taking, etc were great, plus an employee held the garbage can open for us! I kept turning to my husband and saying, \"wow, how can they all be this nice?\"  We're so excited to find such a tasty, healthy bargain right near our gym!! Feeling like we won the lotto :-)",

Yes, I've had Chicago, New York, Philadelphia hotdogs and you cannot compare. It's all hype or placebo effect if you will with all these bogus Yelp reviews giving this restaurant 5 stars.

The burger was 1/3 lb., grilled and tasted fresh.  It's my understanding the restaurant is also known for their all beef hot dogs.  The wait staff was pleasant.  It was fun to read the various vintage signs hung around the room.",

After leaving Chicago over thirty years ago, and with just a couple of visits back since then, I missed a True \"Chicago Hotdog\", and Portillo's filled the bill with a perfect dog, including the poppy seed bun, sport peppers, kelly green relish, and a taste of celery salt.  The service was quick, the restaurant clean, and prices were appropriate.    The Italian beef however left a little to be desired.  We requested the beef dipped, and even with it dipped the beef was dry tasting and over salted.  The roll was great, and the amount of meat in the sandwich was alright, but not \"piled on\".  The sweet peppers on top were very tasty.  5 star dog, and 3 star beef.    After a day, I'm already craving another one.",

Wow they have the gravy down awesome sandwich .   Everything holds together perfect, the bread does not fall apart even with the extra gravy .the sweet peppers were a perfect combination with the beef . You can even add mozzarella , which I didn't honestly it does not need cheese .  I hope the food stays consistent , which I know some  places have this issue. When I went to Al's i thought wow this sandwich was awesome , no wonder why they are so popular in Chicago . Then I read about Portillo's  a lot of Chicagoans saying Portillo's  had the best Italian beef on Chicago.  I thought to myself no way I don't see how they can beat out Al's  , boy was I wrong , do yourself a favor and get one with the  extra gravy and sweet peppers if you like peppers .",

TO me that seems like a wasted staff amount probably could be used inside rather then outside. Took about 7 mins for order big meat - Italian Beef sand. The meat and auju was great bread was lacking it. The onion rings could tell they where fresh however a little bland we where in drive threw and not presented our drink while waiting for our food. I dont mind waiting espic if I have a drink to chill out too but to me that was interesting. I do not understand concept of having to stop and talk to people I would rather pull too the menu board and order that way. If there triing to be like sonic ? It was a friday however I still do not understand why so many steps and still left a little confused. I rather run into chompies.",

I have to mention the man calling out the orders who had a fun rhyme for every number that got called giving the restaurant a different feel than any other restaurant. I guess it's fast food, because it's fast and there's a drive through, but you can't tell with the quality of the product. Watching them work was amazing too, you know they have a great management team. In fact, I'm not sure what I loved more, the food or the employees! Definitely will be a regular here and can't wait to try out their other locations. Seriously one of the best experiences I've had in a while.

    "text": "To be honest, the place isn't all it's cracked up to be, and for a few reasons.   1. Everyone here (and by everyone I mean the customers) are SO bitter! Probably because they have to wait in a 30 minute crowd standing shoulder to shoulder with strangers, but seriously. Everyone is so grumpy and has such an attitude! Normal people turn into vultures hunting and pecking for tables, a spot at the ketchup dispensers, or at the registers and do whatever it takes to get what they want, even at the expense of other diners. It makes the experience a little less pleasant.   2. The whole place seems to lack organization. Not that the restaurant is dirty or disheveled, but the way it is set up doesn't make sense, considering the high volume of people it gets. The line literally wraps around the dining area, and makes it virtually impossible for people to get inside the area where the tables are to find seating. Also, the restaurant is divided into sections. A salad area, a place to order your sandwiches, hot dogs, etc, and then a dessert area. Why can't you just order all at once without having to navigate through crowds of people?  3. The food is just okay. In our party, we ordered the Italian beef sandwich with roasted peppers and mozzarella, a hamburger, side of chicken tenders, cheese fries and regular fries. The sandwich was apparently decent. Not the best my boyfriend has had, but definitely not the worst. The hamburger was also good, but then again, they're not a hamburger joint, and how hard is it to mess up a hamburger. The chicken tenders were something like what you'd find at a Safeway deli. This doesn't mean that they were bad-- they were just average. Not to mention, one of the chicken tenders in the box (each box is a 4-piece) was about the size of a McDonald's chicken nugget, if not smaller. The one thing that caught me was the two orders of fries.. With the cheese fries, you get a normal order of fries with a cup of fake nacho cheese-esque sauce, that you're supposed to dip your fries in or whatever. I would have definitely preferred a cheese that was either melted on top or that had a bit more flavor. And the fries themselves, by looks and taste, were somewhat like the crinkle-cut fries that you'd find in the frozen food section of your local grocer.   Regardless, they still have a really cute atmosphere/decor: that of a 50's/60's Chicago-style diner, and their staff seems to know most of what they're doing. I would go back because their prices are great ($3.65 for a decent-sized burger), but it would be under the conditions that 1. the weather is nice because it's a 50/50 chance that you'll be sitting outside, and 2. that I have a solid hour, hour and a half to blow considering the line to order and the wait to get your food and then find a table.   Anyhow, to sum it up: not great, not terrible. Just average.",

I'm going to talk about the experience and then the reason for the 3stars. I arrived at about 7pm so I expected it to be busy. The line was about 40 feet out the door but that didn't bother me since it just recently opened. I ordered a Jumbo Hot Dog, Cheese Fries, and a Vanilla Shake. All in all it took about 40 minutes to wait in line, order, and get my food. Their hot dogs are the talk of the town so when I started eating mine I thought there was something wrong with me. However, the hot dog bun was extremely wet, not with juicy flavor but from water. The water wouldn't have been a problem if it didn't smell and taste like it was just used to wash some dishes. The same went for the hot dog because when I bit into it I got a squirt of that same water and then I gagged and set it down. Other than that, the pickles, peppers, tomato, mustard, and onions were great but I was really disappointed in the hot dog and bun. The fries are AMAZING and the vanilla shake was pretty darn tasty. I'm going to attribute the dishwasher water flavor to the speed with which they made the food because it was really really busy in there so I will be returning in a few weeks when the hype has died down and hopefully it will be better.",

I love their hot dogs, aside from the fact that their mustard is bland and the only reason you know it's mustard is because it's yellow...

My boss got the wonton chicken salad without the wontons; not that bad I know, but this was 1/2 an hour after my coworker got a grilled chicken salad with no chicken and no side muffin. Adding this to my own experiences where the Italian Beef was really bland (and yes, I got the peppers and gravy so it was soggy, slimy and bland) and when I ordered cheese fries the cheese was all over the inside of the bag and not in the container, well, I think I'll stick with driving a ways to Uncle Sam's.",

None of them had the right texture, seasoning, moisture to be called a Chicago style sandwich. Today we visited Portillo's and are so happy we did.  We had their Italian Beef sandwich and it was like being back in Chicago. We LOVED it. My husband liked it so much he ordered the Big Beef sandwich to go and had it later this evening at home.  One of their salads made my mouth water so next time I'm going to try that. It's an apple walnut chicken salad. The place is large, airy, a little on the noisy side, quick service, plenty of space and an outside patio. We will be back and I'm sure it'll be multiple times.",

One of my favorite places has now lowered itself to the obvious pursuit of increasing its profit margin and making more money. You know what? I would rather pay more for the original unaltered sandwich!  Should have known this would happen after the change in ownership and sale to a private equity firm.",

FWIW, I'm also no fan of Chicago style pizza either...  Today I had Portillo's for lunch, a chili cheese hot dog & cheese fries.  They do not offer Dr. Pepper so I had bottled water. I liked that they sell spring water and for only 99 cents. Usually with bottled water you pay twice that for only 'purified drinking water' so definitely nice they had the real deal.  My food was delivered hot and fresh but simply lacked flavor. I found no condiment other than ketchup and even that wasn't available in to go form. The hot dog was all beef and had the snap of natural casing, but the chili was bland and featured beans (an abomination to any old-fashioned traditionalist-minded Texan).  It just needed SOMETHING, even salt & black pepper would have helped.  The fries were hot and a little salty but the cheese sauce was like what you get on bad ballpark nachos.  Overall just unimpressed...",

With all the hype on the Italian beefs, which ARE very tasty, the hidden gem for me was their burgers. very flavorful, well cooked and taste like they're cooked over an open flame.

They were crinkle cut fries with the perfect crispy outside and soft inside. We also shared the \"famous chocolate cake\", and it was worth it. The cake was moist and delicious, with a perfectly smooth and luscious frosting.   Their menu also has fresh great-looking salads, char-broiled burgers, chicken sandwiches, beef sandwiches (looked like a great Philly-type), shakes, tamales(!), and wonderful smoothies (my son had the strawberry one and loved it).

I never bothered to read reviews or visit the website and thought it was just a big hot dog joint. How excited can anyone ever get about a hot dog?  After reading some great reviews here, my wife and I made an early lunch run Sunday to try the Italian Beef sandwiches and were both very glad we did. She got hers with the spicy peppers and I went with the sweet peppers ($0.50 extra) and neither option disappointed! The peppers came with just the right amount of juice to soak the meat and roll.  The fries were crinkle cut, crispy and just the right amount of salt. The big plus was for an extra $0.50, you get a side of liquid cheese to dip them in if you're into that.  Onion rings were great too!   There were a lot of other things on the menu I wanted to try but didn't have the room for, so we will definitely add Portillo's to our list of favorite places to eat at since its right down the street.  The only negative is that it's crowded and there is no self service soft drinks :(",

My experience in the valley has been- if a restaurant says it is Chicago style- it never comes close to what you can actually get in Chicago. We FINALLY have a REAL Chicago place- an original. And nothing has been lost in translation! I was lucky enough to be there for the test runs, and couldn't resist battling the crowds when they opened yesterday. Their employees are awesome, the food was wonderful! They bake their own bread and cakes on site. Tip- In a hurry???? Check out their drive thru if you can't wait long- my chopped salad only took 10 minutes to pick up. Favorites- Italian beef with hot giardinaire, burgers, chicken sandwiches, amazing salads and ...best chocolate cake EVER!",

    "text": "Why is America getting fatter?  Why is Portillo's busy? Answer one question and you probably answer the other.   I stood in a long line, placed my order, endured endless number-calling (\"54, your order is ready ...\"), sat on an uncomfortable chair, ate food straight from the wrapper, listened to more relentless number calling, suffered without a cold beer to make everything seem better (no alcohol license!), then dumped a massive amount of waste into the garbage (this place is as green as a polystyrene factory - if the order is not 'to go', could they not place the food on a plate?!).    My Italian sausage was edible, the fries were OK. My partner's sandwich was disgusting - wet, disintegrating bread. I got home and for several hours my stomach was in shock ... I probably had more salt that night than in the week preceding!   Why, oh why, is this place so popular?  I mean, sure, the competition in the 'hood is Red Robin, Applebees, and Mimi's Cafe - three establishments fighting for the bottom of the barrel spot - but still ... long lines ... for this?!    I am glad to see a good source of employment for the local retirees who work there, but other than that - not for me!",

I feel like I could have had more food from a stadium hot dog.  The food was warm and I appreciate their cheese fries were not drowning in cheese but on the side (helps not be soggy.)  For the price we paid, I was hoping for a bit more food but otherwise the taste was great!",

    "text": "I could write a huge review about how much I love Portillo's, but I'm going to write a short review, which doesn't mean I love it any less, just that it's simple...I love this place!  I admit I'm addicted to their burgers and fries. I could easily come here all the time and be content with my life. I don't even think about other fast food joints anymore. Love it!! I have yet to try their desserts and shakes, but they look tasty! The food is so fresh. Burgers are delicious. Crinkle fries are crispy with the right amount of salt, topped off with a coke and I'm in burger heaven! Lucky I don't live too far from this location!",

    "text": "I would rate this fair at best. Its very loud and busy. They wanted our order before we saw the menu. You have to order at the counter then pick up your order and try to find a place to sit. The hot dogs are small and average at best. The Italian beef was tasteless and on a soggy bun. I paid extra for sweet peppers that one would need a microscope to find and once found they had no taste, a waste of money. The onion rings were on par with most fast food places, average at best.  Our dinner for two was $20.00 at a walk up to order place, that wasn't bad enough until you realize you have to try to find a clean table. They have a sign that you have to clean your own table! There were a lot of dirty tables and nobody cleans them. Now you get a walk up to order and pick up yourself, eat at a filthy table and get average food for $20.00.  On the up side the decor was kind of cool but that isnt enough to get us back. My 2 stars is a gift.",

    "text": "I saw a line out the door when I was on my way home from work the other day, so I figured it must be a great place.  I checked out the menu online and decided I wanted to take my parents over there to try it.   Now my dad loves Italian beef sandwiches, so i usually take him to Luke's across the freeway.  So sorry to Luke's for trying something new.  We got there about 11:30 am, just right before the lunch rush but looks like that started pretty early.  The outdoor patio was full with customers and the line inside was pretty long.  Now let me tell you that I've never seen so many people working in a restaurant before but it was definitely needed!   The first thing you have to do is get in line to order your food.  Keep in mind that if you want salads, you would need to go to two different areas to pick up your food.  But like I said, there are lots or people working that its pretty quick for the order coming out.  Finding a table was no that big of a problem, so I had the Asian chicken salad and my dad had the Italian beef.  My mom and nephew had the Chicago style hot dogs.  The salad was very good and a good portion and i took a bite of the Italian beef and it was awesome.  You have a choice of having your Italian beef sandwich dipped in Au jous to make the meal more juicy which is what i recommend.   The place is very good but is you want to avoid the lunch crowd, come after 12:30pm, that's when the crowds kinda lighten up.",

Absolutely excellent.  I have eaten here a few times now, and do have one bit of advise.  I personally like my Italian Beef sandwich dipped.  If you do as well, make sure you are eating there.  I made the mistake of not getting the ah jus on the side, instead of dipped, and had a rather soupy mess when i got home.  The meat and peppers was still amazing, but the bread had lost all molecular integrity.  Make the trip to try this place.  Well worth it!",
