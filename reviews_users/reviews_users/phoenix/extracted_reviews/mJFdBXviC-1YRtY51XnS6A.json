I understand it is only 1.29$ but that practice is extremely annoying.    Quesidilla= its melted cheese in a tortilla...not hard to mess up.  Flautas = average  Carne Asada burrito = in the absolute top ten of the worst dishes I have EVER had in terms of mexican food.  The meat was the hardest, most difficult, leather-like cut I have had in years.  I couldn't eat it.  I know going into a mexican food place a 6.50$ burrito is a 6.50$ burrito.  However, after reading a majority of the reviews, I had seriously high hopes.",

They have a bar area that had more patrons at it then were sitting at the tables for food.   They did not have to twist our arm to get us to try their margarita drink special. The margaritas were pretty average but they were cheap so that is a win in my book!  The drinks worked well with the basket of chips and 3 salsas which were delivered to the table. One of the salsas was ridiculously mild, but the green and hotter red (habanero) were tasty. Our server did a great job keeping us topped off with the two salsas that we liked.   We ordered the lobster enchiladas and the parilladas. The lobster enchilada was not overflowing with lobster but there was enough there to let it be known that it was  present. This was my first time having parilladas, which is essentially a mixed meat fajita with pan fries thrown in for good measure. Not a huge fan of the potato addition so I will opt for straight up fajitas in the future.   Definitely a great choice for good food in an elevated fast food setting.",

I recently returned after having a taco craving and remembered why we used to go here for lunch. You order each taco a la carte so you can mix and match. Their blackened shrimp tacos are delicious, but spicy... at least for me. My favorite was the carnitas taco. They give you a ton of guacamole and it's so flavorful. In the past, I remember ordering at the counter. This time, we were seated and ordered at our table. I'm not sure if this is what they always do or just during dinner. Overall, the prices are great and the food is delicious. I definitely won't forget about Habanero's next time I have a taco craving... which is at least once a week.",

Lots of meat, beans, cheese and all the other fixings that nachos should have. The chicken fajitas were huge for $10. Not the best ones I've had considering there's no lettuce or tomato included, but not bad. Lots of peppers and onions.  The carnitas burrito (enchilada style) is something I would definitely pass on. The meat was extremely bland and there wasn't any wet sauce that you could expect on an enchilada style burrito.  I would give them a 3.5, but I'm rounding down because I'm not necessarily dying to go back. The quality just wasn't quite there, but at the price point it's still a value.",

The rest was a weird mixture of warm onions and pepper on top of salad greens. The greens instantly became wet, warm, and soggy. Overall, a very weird and gross dish.  To make matters worse, the place is extremely noisy inside. It's basically cafeteria style where you order at the counter.  They even have the little cafeteria trays. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I will give them the benefit of a doubt that perhaps the tacos are halfway decent.  I definitely won't be back to find out. Lots of great places to have lunch in Scottsdale. No need to waste $15 on this place.",

It was very busy on a Friday night and very loud but I was able to find one empty table and the food was good so that made up for the loud environment!! The staff were all very attentive and helpful! The tacos were good, not \" out of this world\" but pretty great anyway!! It's very reasonable priced I would say.. I love that they bring two different kinds of salsa with chips! The green was my favorite. If I come again I would maybe try something different on the menu.",

Great atmosphere.. college football and basketball on tv, full bar, plenty of seeing, well kept.. there's no wonder why Habanero's is still open out here, nearby to so many bars and clubs!

Little confused cause the dining area was so nice it almost felt like a sit down place but dumb me they have ordering counter.   Me and my daughter ordered the same thing. Carne asada burrito and a side of chips. The side of chips comes with two salsa. A red and green salsa. Really like the red but the green seemed a little sour to me. Just to clarify I liked both. The carne asada burrito was really good. Nice moist and juicy meat with guacamole, Pico de gallo, and Jalapenos. So it had a nice little kick to it. Not too hot but just right.   I was very surprised by the service. They bring your food to your table and I even had a few people ask us if the food was okay. That's a nice touch for a place like this. They even thanked us for coming in as we left. Very nice.   Food was good, great service and friendly. Let me see, I think i will be back. Quick food and friendly people. Enjoy.",

When you order anything, it goes on the grill, which is essentially located within the dining area.  You can see everything that goes in to making your order.  I have tried just about everything, and can highly recommend the blackened fish, carnitas, and ground beef.  Whether it's in a taco, burrito or nachos.  The ground beef is surprisingly awesome.  Not your typical 'wet' ground beef.  They dry-flavor the hamburger, then grill it.  Best I have ever had.  I still need to try the blackened chicken, but having a hard time ordering something new!  Oh yeah, they make a fantastic breakfast burrito too.",

Chips and salsa was ala carte so that was kind of a flag for me. Attentive service and quick with getting me my order though so I figured it would be cool if the food went well. I was not impressed. I had ordered two carne asada tacos and they were just bland. Not much in terms of seasoning. Just, flavorless meat with corn tortilla and cabbage. Boring. The salsa and chips weren't particular flavorful either. I don't me myself going back any time soon.",

Your prices keep increasing and your portions continue to decrease.  Getting salsa with an order seems to be a True put out and when you do, the size of the container is so small, there's hardly any in it.  An order of chips and salsa is almost $2.00 for slightly over a tablespoon of salsa?  Today we called in an order - ordered steak fajitas, got beef flautas, my shrimp quesadilla honestly had 1 little shrimp in one entire quarter of the quesadilla and hardly no cheese and the guac was brown.  I know you guys are a family owned business and you deserve to make money, but go ahead and raise the prices to a comfortable level, then don't skip on the ingredients.  You can't continue to cut ingredients and raise prices without also losing long time customers.   Had this been my first visit, I would never go back.",

Okay, it's not Chipotle or a (fill in the blank) bertos but seems to run in the middle.  If that makes sense.  The best part of the burritos is that its just meat, guacamole, and some pico de gallo no beans.  I know they say beans are good for you but it doesn't mean I have to like them.  Besides I think there is already enough mush in the burrito with the guacamole.   =)",

    "text": "I eat here relatively frequently.  That alone says something.  Everything here is solid, but some dishes truly stand out.  Tops among them is the Parrillada.  That dish is unique and comes with potatoes, onions, chicken, steak, chorizo and carnitas.  On the side is beans (pinto or black, your choice), rice, sour cream and guacamole.  Order an extra 2 tortillas (comes with 3) when you get this as unless your fajita making skills are vastly superior to mine (which would not be difficult), you won't finish this meal in 3 tortillas.  I eat it with the habenero sauce which is very tasty and spicy.  As another reviewer mentioned, the guacamole is not going to be the most spectacular, \"eat it plain with nothing but a chip, table-side type variety\" that you've ever had. But it's good fresh avacado that provides a nice creaminess and pairs nicely with the rest of the dish.  And... they won't charge you $1.95 extra to get some. Another dish I like is their nachos.  I get blackened chicken, sometimes with chorizo.  That option is not on the menu, but they'll make it if you ask.  It comes with pinto beans which will make some of the chips soggy.  If that's a problem, request it \"no beans, extra cheese\".  It comes with real cheese (two types) and none of that nacho cheese whiz crap that other places insist on foisting upon unsuspecting customers.  Other dishes I've had are the quesadilla (shrimp), the breakfast burrito (chorizo) and the revoltura (another breakfast dish).  I've enjoyed them all.  But, if I were to recommend 1 dish, it's the Parrillada.  It's the most unique dish on their menu and what keeps me coming back for more.",

I like tortillas that are on the thinner side, and these fit the bill.   I had to take away a star because I ordered a mahi-mahi burrito, was charged for a mahi-mahi burrito, but received chicken. Since the food is made fresh, it takes a bit of time to be prepared. We did not have the time to wait for them to remake the food properly. The black beans were also just kind of there. While my husband enjoyed the guacamole, I thought it was okay. I prefer it more natural. This was more creamy. It reminded me of the \"Wholly Guacamole\" brand.   The guys working there were super friendly, and upbeat.",

    "text": "Take this review with a grain of salt... I don't really like \"American\" Mexican food. I came here a few weeks ago and got their Super Nachos (I forgot what they were called). They were alright, but the taste wasn't really authentic. Some of the people I went with got other stuff and they liked their food, but like I said, I am very critical of Mexican food that does not have a lot authentic staples. It all tastes like Taco Bell to me.  The usual suspects were at play here: bunch of sour cream, guacamole that tastes like most guac from these types of places, pasty beans, etc.   Service was very good so no complaints on that front. I'm just real fickle when it comes to taste with Mexican restaurants, so I tend to be really picky with Mexican restaurants.",

    "text": "This place is definitely a step up from the same old bertos style fast Mexican places. I think the food seems much better quality and you have better options if you want something more. There is also plenty of room to dine in, as this isn't as much of a to go place as most fast taco shops.   The service here is fantastic. The cashiers and cooks have always been super friendly. You order at the front and then they'll deliver your food to you, so it's not super fancy or anything, but they are still attentive to their customers. Even while dining they have always checked on our table and cleared plates if needed.   They have some amazing specials, I would always recommend ordering them if they sound good to you. From their tacos, to shrimp quesadillas, to just the chips, rice and beans, this place is phenomenal, especially for the value. It's casual but satisfying and filling.   They also serve alcohol and have a few seats a bar up front. Highly recommend!!!",

I was hungry after swimming laps, this was the closest Mexican restaurant from the Cactus pool. I noticed they were closing shortly but came in anyway and they said okay to come in, (while I believe they really didn't want to).  There were no other customers on Sunday afternoon, I quickly ordered a cold glass of beer and two types of tacos (fish and lobster). They brought two tacos pretty quick. I started with lobster tacos and they were good, but fish tacos was pretty plain and fish was dry. I tasted my friend's dish but that was just okay too. Nothing great to make me want to come back here again.  As soon as they served food, they started cleaning, as if they are telling us hurry up and leave. We left before 2:30pm before their official closing time.  I guess since there were no other customers, they thought they could leave early. So I wished they would have just turned away when we walked in. I didn't want to feel rushed out.",

We walked in and thought, ok I guess we place our order at the cashier and then find a seat. But we were seated and given menus, though they were paper and all the other service items were paper/plastic except for my margarita glass. It felt odd because it was kind of trying to be a restaurant but only in certain ways. I guess I shouldn't complain because the prices were very reasonable. We had a nice waitress with good service. Overall the food was great! I wasn't that hungry but the blackened chicken tacos with a hard shell were awesome and could have eaten 5 or 6. If I could get specific with improvements, it would be to offer real plates and glasses for all table service, upgrade the paper napkins and menus and warm up the chips and offer them complimentary.",

I found Habanero's on Yelp, we tried it, and concur with the many positive reviews that this restaurant (and the one up near Airpark/Scottsdale) have received.  Very good Mexican food!    The restaurant is definitely fast-food oriented (rather than sit down and be waited on) and while we would prefer sit down and be waited on, we will gladly order at the counter to get good Mexican food.  The food isn't bland and a little more zip can be added with some auxiliary spicy hot sauce.    We will definitely return to this place!",

There seemed to be a good amount of \"regulars\" which is always a good sign, especially with larger-sized familes in this economy. I had the blackened chicken nachos (okay, half an order and wish I had been with someone to share the huge portion). There was tons of chicken, fresh chopped guacamole, plus all the other yummy fixin's one would expect to find. Wash down with a fountain drink, bottled beer, or house margarita and it makes for a tasty treat! I think I'll go back next weekend to try the breakfast menu - ole!",

    "text": "Solid, but lacking that little something that could make a spot like this special.  We started off with chips and salsa. Liked the multicolored chips, but they were a little stale and served cold. Made me a little sentimental about the chips at Blue Burrito which used to be located nearby. Served with green and red salsas that could be characterized as Scottsdale bland.  We opted for a couple of tacos and a quesadilla. The blackened chicken quesadilla was definitely the highlight of the meal, but the tacos. a carne asada and a blackened chicken, were just average. Disappointing also in that my request for two types of tortillas was not honored. The whole wheat tortillas were thin and dry, good for me I suppose, but nothing special and not what I ordered. The chicken taco also had quite a runoff of mystery fluid that filled my basket, a major taco pet peeve of mine. I'd also appreciate easier access to some salsa to help doctor the tacos as needed, not just a bottle of pepper sauce on the table.  No kids with us on this visit, but they do have chicken fingers ($4.99) and Cheese Quesadillas ($4.50) served with a choice of rice, beans or fries for children. No drink included.  They also serve alcohol, with a happy hour from 3-6 p.m. weekdays. They serve domestic and imported beers, as well as a house margarita and other specialty drinks.   Ordering can be a bit slow, as we fell in behind some carryout orders at the counter on this visit, but service is quick once an order is placed.   The staff here is always nice. I suspect if I ate here more often my review would gradually become more glowing just because of their friendly attitude. I will definitely come back. Just not that often with so many other good Mexican grills and restaurants available in metro Phoenix.",

This place does what Mexican restaurants I grew up eating at growing up did - unpretentious, high quality honest food.  Finding the place isn't the easiest as they are literally tucked in between a sandwich shop and animal hospital, totally invisible from Scottsdale road because of the Denny's out front, but once you've found it, you don't want to go to any other \"taco shop.\"  I've tried a few different taco's, next on my list is their fried fish, can't wait.  Their carnita's they crisp up a portion when your order it, so it's a bit crispy.  Today I had something I know I'll order again; shrimp fajita burrito, enchilada style with green sauce.  To Die 4!  I've spread the word at my work as well about their very reasonable catering as we've become tired of the sandwich and pizza staples in the area.    Check this place out, support your True local mom & pops over the other chain \"taco shop\" in the area, you will not be disappointed.",

The Carne Asada is very good also. Everything is always tasty and consistent. Service is fast and the staff is friendly.

It was perfect for that purpose.There was plenty of seating, so we got a table immediately. When I first walked in, I thought that the setup of the place was such that you order up front, but it was a full service meal. The kitchen is open, so you can see what's cooking back there.  The service was friendly, the restaurant was clean.  As for the food, I was pretty impressed. We ordered the parrillada for 2, so we got a really good mix of what the place has to offer. The meal comes out on a plate for the guacamole, sour cream, beans (of which you have a choice of refried or black), and rice and a little grill for all of the meat. And there was a lot of meat! There was chicken, chorizo, steak, and carnitas on this plate. You also get your choice of tortillas (corn, flour, or wheat). On both the tortillas and the beans, we got to choose separately, so we had some corn and wheat tortillas.  The meat was all great! Juicy and tender, it all made for good tacos. Add a little guacamole and some of the salsa, and this is some tasty food.  I'll definitely come back, and I'll likely find it difficult to order something other than the parrillada. It's a great option!",

There is lots of competition for Mexican places, so this place would be top notch anywhere else, but here, it's the best in the area for price, taste, and convenience. It's where I go for good Mexican food when I don't feel like driving to sketchy parts of central or south Phoenix (Carolina's, La Santisima, etc)",

Didn't know we went during happy hour and draft beers were $2.99. Total bill with tip $30. Worth every penny. Will be back when we are in town.",

Service is very prompt and attentive. The HH margarita is HUGE and right on. Stuffed jalepenos (fresh, not pickled) are stuffed, fried and tasty. Padilla for 2 is generous and tasty as well.",

Mind you they opened a little after I started work but the point is I could always eat at this place and enjoy the food.    I either order the blacken chicken burrito or the blacken chicken tacos.  They are always amazing, I would recommend these to people all the time.  Everyone I have gotten them for loves them.  The chorizo breakfast burritos are also really good.    They use fresh ingredients and make amazing food.  The owner is there all the time and a great guy as well.  If you have never eaten here I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "I have been coming here for lunch over the past few months and I finally decided it was time to write a review. Habanero's is definitely a nice little spot for lunch, it's quick but the food is made fresh. Being a Mexican food fanatic I know good Mexican food and this is definitely it. Everything on the menu is fairly inexpensive but the portions are a good size, I always leave feeling satisfied.   My favorite item on the menu is the blackened fish taco salad, it has everything you could ever want on a taco salad from tasty guacamole to satisfying rice and beans. The blackened fish is absolutely amazing, it's cooked to perfection. I highly recommend anything on the menu that has the blackened fish.   Today I decided to try something a little different. I ordered the a la Mexicana with chicken. It's juicy marinated chicken sauteed with jalapenos and onions, it also comes with a side of rice and beans and warm flour tortillas. I definitely wasn't disappointed. The chicken was flavorful and grilled to perfection. I made tacos out of the chicken, rice and beans and then covered them with the habanero salsa. The habanero salsa gave the tacos a big kick, but it was worth my mouth being on fire for the remainder of my lunch break.  The only reason that I gave Habanero's 4 stars is because I'm not the biggest fan of their salsa. I am a salsa connoisseur (you probably didn't know there was such a thing lol), so I am quite critical when it comes to salsa. They have 3 kinds of salsa, verde (mild), red (medium) and habanero (very hot!). All of their salsas are very thin, they have more of a hot sauce consistency. While the salsas do taste good mixed in with your meal they aren't really ideal for chips and salsa but it all depends on what kind of salsa consistency you prefer.   Overall the food is delicious, the staff is very friendly and the service is wonderful! I will definitely become a regular!",

    "text": "Five stars for it being my favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale!  I was beginning to lose hope I'd never find good Mexican food.  Thank goodness for Habanero's!  It's definitely one of those great places that will never do you any wrong by ordering today's thing.  Both times I've been here I've ordered from that separate menu item.  First time, I ordered the Blackened Chicken & Relleno burrito that was served Enchilada-style...and was saddened by the reality that I had finished eating this burrito.  The next time, I ordered the Surf & Turf burrito and loved it almost as much as the first burrito I ate here.  You can't go wrong ordering chips & salsa here.  There's nothing like dipping those mult-colored tortilla chips in that salsa verde.  And don't be afraid to order a drink with your food....because they have so many delicious beverages to choose from.  Don't get Coke or Sprite...try something new!  They have horchata, jamaica, timarindo, pina colada, etc.  Try one of those and it won't disappoint.  I'm salivating just by typing those words.",

I like that they have a bar and great Mexican beer selection along with fun Mexican sodas!  I had the fish, calamari, and chicken tacos..... they were just okay. I was hoping for more flavor. They were good so I may go back, but I am an as satisfied as I hoped.",

Had lunch last week including a chicken fajita burrito with voids and guac. The chips and guac were tasty and fresh. The burrito was awesome, I'm talking better than chipotle awesome. Washed it all down with a cold negro modelo.   If you're looking for a solid, quick and tasty Mexican meal, don't miss habanero's.  Another yelp success!",
