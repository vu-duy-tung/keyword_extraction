But I did take one star because they desperately need to update their menu. For months now there are incorrect items...including last night when I ordered the Tempure Ice Cream only to find out they no longer use Chocolate & Peanut Butter ice cream but they now use Chocolate & Banana. Same with the drink menu. Not a huge deal...just a little annoying.",

They offer a few rooms that fit 10+ people, so you can invite just those friends that you don't mind embarrassing yourself in front of! So much fun! Some girlfriends and I were able to belt out some awesome tunes this weekend! The only reason it didn't get 5 stars, was because it was $75/hour for the room! Holy moly, I'll pass on those kind of prices! Granted, with that price came a super tasty plate of mixed sushi options. Thankfully my friend had won us a free hour, to sing til our hearts were content, and sing we did! :D",

The atmosphere is hip and inviting. The only downside was the waitress, she was so hard to read and acted like she didn't want to be there. But the food was good, so I wasn't too pissy about her lack of enthusiasm. But it would have make my experience that much better if the waitress was on her A Game. Definitely recommend!! The flavored Saki is pretty good too!!",

    "text": "This place= great hang out place for a group of friends and I could easily give it a four stars- but here's why I gave it what it got.  I was really amped about this place because a group of my friends are going to hit the town, get drunk and karaoke.  Turned out- this Geisha is no Zhang Ziyi.    The room is $150 for two hours- we checked in around 10:30 ish for two hours so I figured we would get out at 12:30 - when we got there they were still cleaning the room so we didn't get it at ten.  Since we  were getting into the groove of things a little before our time was up, I got another hour for us thinking we'd get another hour- the cashier charged us for the full hour but we would have to leave at 1 AM- I ask her why because we aren't getting the room for the full hour and her response was \"We have to get everyone out of the room at 1.\"  Which I was cool with because she's doing her job- but why charge me for the whole hour?  It didn't make sense to me- making me go-go a ga-ga.  I didn't give a fist about it because I have a large group- but that is something Geisha should review...business ethic?    BTW the \"large sushi platter\" that is suppose to come with our two hour reservation turned out to be a \"tiny platter\"- if you ever had the boat order or know what I'm talking about with that reference- think 1/3 of that.  The sushi is mediocre.    The lady who served us didn't really teach us how to use the remote control and one of the TVs in the room did not work.  Our mic was cutting in and out- I didn't remember anyone was bad enough for the mic to cut out like that.  It did and one just stop working- and took them a while to come in to fix it for us.    The UPs for this joint is the private room and the pole in the room.  It is a good enough reason for anyone to come to this location.  It is something different for Scottsdale and it's a lot of fun if you come with the right people.   The bar area is also nice because it has a little dance floor and high tables/chairs for people just to sit and hang out.  Also there's a patio area.  It is a good hang out spot for a night out aside from my bad experience mentioned.",

There's also a hug big rock in the middle of the floor so you can look silly dancing around it.  I went with a couple of friends on a Sat nite so the place was crowded with young good looking people.  As for the sushi - it was okay to me. It wasn't bad, but it didn't give me the \"wow, this is delicious\" reaction. But they do have a squid salad that is very tasty and chewy. Great with beer!   They also have a private karaoke room that you can rent. However, if you have been to one of those Korean karaoke room, you will be disappointed here. It can be boring looking at a blank screen with just lyrics and the songs are limited to just only American songs. So if you're looking forward to singing to a Super Junior music video, it won't be here. Don't expect a great sound system and disco lighting. However, they do have a dancing pole in the middle of the room for any sexy ladies to show off their dancing skill.",

    "text": "This review is primarily regarding the larger karaoke room you can rent. Considering the rate begins at $300 for 3 hours (with $150 going toward food and drinks, but depending on the number of people you have it will be well above that) one would expect Geisha A Go Go to maybe channel their profits toward maintenance and cleaning of the room. One area of the carpet by the stage had a strong smell of urine (which is great while eating,) and several of the seat cushions were in such poor shape that they were sunken into the seat several inches. A friend of mine who had rented the same room in 2009 felt it was much nicer back then and that they hadn't updated it since. The service, food, and drinks were not an issue, but the karaoke room itself was quite disgusting. You'd be better off going to a local bar that has karaoke, sharing the mic with others, and saving hundreds of dollars.",

You feel like you have your own space but get to enjoy being with all the other patrons.  Very well designed.  The low ceiling of the restaurant lends itself to a very quaint feeling. Well appointed and designed with a unique twist.  Not your standard decor for a restaurant with an Asian theme name. Great outdoor patio that flows into the main area so that you can look out onto the street whether you are seated inside or out.  Our waitress was excellent.  Attentive and followed up without hovering.  We couldn't ask for better service.  I started with one of their signature happy hour drinks. \"Turning Japanese\" which is a pear cocktail.  Perfectly yummy!  Not to sweet, not to dry. (Happy Hour specialty cocktails are half price.  Right on!)  They offer all their appetizers half price as well for happy hour.  We started with two rolls; a rainbow roll and a lobster roll.  Both very good and fresh.  We followed  up with scallop sliders....FABULOUS! These must be tried, they are unique and wonderful!!  They also have a very unique list of flavored infused Saki.  If you love Saki you will want to give these a try.  The only reason I didn't give a full five stars is because I will want to come back and try the full menu, not just happy hour.  But, from what I've seen and experienced, I would suggest this Sushi style restaurant to anyone!",

First off the sushi was a little overpriced for what it was, I didn't get much for what I payed and the service wasn't great.  my waitress was absent until it was time to pay the check.

We sat outside and the environment was great. Cool vibes, and our cooler waitress came up and got our drink order. I got a lemon drop - it's my favorite drink for sushi and I get it all the time. I was disappointed by the drink. It had a ton of ice chips floating on the top and was really harsh, not smooth or sweet in the slightest.   We got a few appetizers - the gyoza was delicious! I loved the sauce that came with it. We also got a shrimp tempura roll and it was what I expected it to be - it was, in a word, alright. Nothing to write home about.   I got the salmon seaweed salad bowl and my husband got the Astro boy roll. He loved his roll and it looked beautiful (I'm mad I didn't take pictures!). The salmon bowl had great flavor, but I wish the salmon was cut into manageable pieces instead of huge slices of it covering the whole bowl. Without a knife (they only give you chopsticks, which I can appreciate, but still), it was really hard to get a full bite of flavor. It was still delicious though.   Experience wise, the crowd wasn't really my kind of crowd. Pretty typical old town Scottsdale crowd - complete with loud golf carts full of drunk people (at 3:00 pm on a Sunday! Go to church you sinners!) ready to par-tay.   I would say if it's late and you want sushi and to maybe sing some drunk karaoke, this place would be tops. If you want some chill sushi with your husband on a Sunday afternoon, it's not the best.",

Geisha a Go Go sits right on the higher end of middle range sushi.   When you first walk in, an assortment of Japanses video games line the walls. The dining room is trendy, and there are lots of different types of seating, including the bar.  The drink specials are always good, and some of their signature drinks are spectacular.   They even have karaoke rooms you can rent! Seriously! How amazing is that!  From what I hear they run around 200 dollars which is an amazing steal for the experience.   I know it's geeky, but I love the Japanese toilets. I can't tell you have many times I beg my husband to buy us one, but apparently they are \"expensive\" and \"not a necessity\"   I've had date nights with the hubs, bachlorette parties, birthday partys, happy hours, and family gatherings at this place, and it never stops being a good time.

Tonight we went there and the hostess would not let us have a 4top and was forcing us to the bar! For us we like to have a table for date night I asked her to tell the manager she has regulars here who don't want to sit at the bar and if they would do us the courtesy of giving 1 of 3 of the 4tops with very bad attitude she left us and came back to say our manager will not let you have a 4 top! What kind of customer service is this? I will never step foot here again and as being in Arizona for 17 years and owning restaurants and nightclubs I will make sure that my sphere of influence knows what happened.  Hostess and management should be fired immediately if this was my place.",

They have happy hour every day from 3-7pm, and 1/2 price on all drinks and appetizers for all day Sunday.  Their infused sake is amazing in pomegranate and strawberry. I'm not a fan of the mango or cucumber flavors. Sake bombers are on point.  Can't go wrong with the appetizer basics, Edamame. The Chicken Lettuce wraps are a delicious combination of chicken and vegetables. If you like Fritos then you need to try the Pokeman roll, containing frito crusted salmon, spicy crap, and avocado!  One drawback is the wait for a table, but usually there is room at the bar while you wait to be seated.",

Loud, mostly bad, rock music blared (I guess in keeping with the GoGo theme?) and made it feel more like a club than a restaurant. The Japanese Cobb salad had nasty tomatoes, some bad lettuce and a tiny cup of dressing and a small, apparently dying, fly found his way onto my salad and wouldn't shoo away.   The barmaid was very helpful, friendly and attentive even though she didn't know how to make a Paloma.   This place is over priced for the poor quality of the food. I won't be going back.",

The music is great, service is superb, and the place is very trendy and has a super cool vibe. We have ordered the ribs, wings, fried rice, ramen, and assorted sushi. All were tasty. And priced right at happy hour. Karaoke rooms available for parties and the staff is cute and peppy, never an empty glass for us. Great place to hang or bring a date. Get a reservation if you go during busy time or they will turn you away  or sit you in the sun, Bummer.",

Geisha is often pretty busy and can be a tad loud, so if you're expecting a super traditional, authentic Japanese outing, you may want to consider going elsewhere. That said, the vibe is very fun, the private karaoke rooms are ridiculously cool and I've always found the staff (particularly the hostesses because we get take-out more often than not) to be very kind. If you're reading this, take my advice and give it a shot, I think you'll love it!",

During happy hour, sake is pretty inexpensive, and they have tons of fruit-infused flavors! Overall, decent place.",

The service is terrible. There were two hostesses. One was Asian and very kind and sweet. The other one ugh oh my!! I can't describe how rude she was. She must think that she is doing customers a big favor by organizing the sitting. Since she said it would be 20 mins we just went to the bathroom and then stopped at the bar. A min later we see her pointing at as as if her mother never told her that pointing at people while you talk about them is rude!! I read other reviews and seems like I am not the only one thinking that. And is not like it was busy at all. Was close to 9 pm on Sunday.  Now, despite it wasn't exactly packed when I ordered a drink it took 15 mins or more to get it. At the time of taking the order for our food they did not set up the table. I waited like 10 mins for soy sauce after my sushi arrived. So much that I just gave up and ate half of the roll without it. And the next sushi took close to 20 mins to come after the first one. Pretty pretty slow service. I was a server at some time in my life and I can understand it can be overwhelming. But then there's times when the service is just plain uncaring. This is one of those times.  The ambience is priceless. You can't argue with that. Is it worth eating a mediocre sushi with mediocre service. Not at all. For years I spoke wonders of this place to my husband who had never been there. He was so sad to see me so disappointed.  But oh well. I will just go back to my new place and never look back for sure. :)",

So it took me along time to try out Geisha even though I have heard about it relentlessly from my \"cool\" friends.  We had a double date during happy hour, which is perfect for good prices, availability, and people watching.  The atmosphere is pretty cool. It borders on cheesy but it is still pretty fun. I love the pics of the rock starts on the wall. That makes any place cool.   The music they were blasting was a great mix of rock, new and old.   People watching was incredible. Highly entertaining, especially if you are married and in your 30's like me and you want to watch the mating game unfold in front of your eyes.  The sushi was so-so. Can't complain with the half off prices though.  The drinks were really good but I couldn't repeat the names of them to my server without blushing...  Veggie lettuce wraps were good, nothing outstanding. My favorite dish were the vegetable gyozas. They were delicious! Next time I'm skipping the sushi and ordering 2 orders of them. The filling was delicious and they were grilled perfectly. The spicy mustard aioli it came with was perfect.   Service was good. Our server was a typical Scottsdale babe, except she was nice and NOT a pretentious wench like some of them can be.   Management checked on us a couple times to see how we are doing, which is always nice.  We had a blast and will definitely be back...",

While Geisha-a-go-go is nowhere close to a hole in the wall, they do serve damn good sushi!   The prices were pretty reasonable. The fried rice was the best thing I've eaten! It was so delicious. I wanted to do a repeat of that dish. The rolls were all delicious and tasty, although nothing I special, but so far the best I've ever had since living here. The dessert was ok. It was a friend banana lumpia dish. The really good part of that dessert though was the coconut gelato, which I found out they order from a local gelato shop. So nothing special there.   The ambiance and location are what sets this sushi place a part from the others in Phoenix. I love the rock n' roll influenced decor and loud rock music blaring. I especially liked the part where the waitresses were not trying to impress by greeting me in a horrible Japanese translation of hajimemashite or konichiwa. I've cringed at other restaurants that do that out here and it's not pretty.   The raspberry sake we had was more then enough for a party of four. The wait staff was ok. Nothing special to be honest, but she wasn't rude or anything, just average service.   I was bummed to find out later that they give out pretty funny fortune cookies. I didn't get one, and had to find out about it on Instagram. So if you are eating here, ask for a fortune cookie.",

    "text": "I used to love this place until recent visits. Service has sucked lately...and really bad. Not only have I noticed, also my friends who are frequent patrons as well. I didn't really go for the food, as its sub-par nowadays. The only reason why I went was for the happy hour on drinks, half off everything.  There are only few waitresses I recognize from my early visits here, otherwise I feel as if I have to repeat myself.   Well on one occasion friends and I rented a karaoke room, afterwards we asked to split the bill but she took ages and had major confusion. We waited like 20-30 for the checks to split and whatnot. Before we went into the karaoke room, we requested to have a table ready at 10pm when our time was up. So it was time to enjoy the dining area, YET they didn't have a table ready. Every was there an accounted for, and we told them our plans and yet they didn't comply. Even though there was a 2 hours heads up. WTF?!   On my last visit, friends and I had a decent time until the bill came. We had to dispute some charges, asked for a manager and expressed that we had been patrons for over 2 years and this was the first time I, myself, had a problem. Just when I thought he obliged, he said he would take care of the situation and take off somethings. Moments later he returns with ONE item taken off and gratuity added. Again WTF? It was there on the first bill, let alone other previous bills where I had large parties before. I was outraged! We paid only the first total with cash and left immediately. I was so furious, I couldn't wait to get home and write to BBB.   3 weeks later, no response from the company and now BBB has it on record. Thankfully I have found other places with decent happy hour and better food!! Goodbye Geisha.",

    "text": "My bestie and I stopped in last night for sushi after partying it up on a \"school night\" in Old Town for Halloween. I love that Geisha is open late. Sushi seems to taste even better when hungry and I had gone out without eating first. Geisha wasn't crowded when we arrived and we sat at the bar to eat.  I rarely...almost never, eat fried food, but I craved a Vegas roll. Geisha doesn't have a Vegas roll (say what?!) so the bartender told me to order the Philly roll, and to write Vegas roll next to it. My bestie ordered the sashimi platter. Both orders arrived quickly. I bit into my roll with eager anticipation, but was surprised/turned off by the bacon grease flavor. ewww. I tolerated it because I didn't want the drama but hungrily eyed the nearby sashimi platter with drooling mouth.   Lesson learned. Don't order a Vegas roll at geisha...get the sashimi platter.  I enjoyed eyeing all of the Halloween costumes as we dined and chatted. Geisha might become an after party destination from now on, but not for a Vegas roll or anything fried.",

I asked do you know what the wait is for a table, he responded \"it's not my job to know how long your going to have to wait.\" That's fine, but common courtesy would have you say, \"I'm sorry I don't know.\" Then when I asked the hostess who seemed utterly uninterested in helping people once again I got an answer of \"ummm idk, 35-40.\" It's pretty sad. Everyone in Scottsdale has been nothing but respectful and kind, but apparently none of those people are who this business hires. The owner should look into his workers, if I owned this restaurant i'd be mortified that this is how my employees run my business. Disgraceful.",

The drinks came out fairly quickly but were extremely watered down, then came the appetizer (chicken gyoza) this was the highlight of the experience and why I gave 1 stars (+ the pachinko games are a nice touch)!  So after finishing the gyoza we anticipated our sushi rolls, and anticipated , and anticipated...after about 25 minutes (no joke) I asked the server what the hold up was, she mumbled something about how they only have 1 sushi chef today or something like that (no \"I will go check on that for you\")...when we finally do get our rolls there was a nigiri that was not on our list and we were missing a roll..also they tried to cram most of the rolls on one plate?...I asked the server about the missing roll and she said \"it wasn't on the sheet\" , I asked to see the sushi order slip, server said it was already in the trash, so they asked if I wanted them to make the roll and I said nope, my friend and I had already been there for over 45 minutes and I didn't want to wait around longer, my big issue was the server's stubborn attitude about what was ordered...couple of things about sushi bars...1-it should never take long to get sushi, if it does the place sucks..2-sushi order sheets are pretty much perfect for getting orders correct, or at the least you can blame the customer for marking the wrong thing if they actually did...3-not doing your job then blaming mistakes on the customer is why restaurants in Old Town change ownership so often and ultimately fail, one investor after another try to be \"hip\" instead of just being a good restaurant, they deserve to fail.",

    "text": "I am so incredibly disappointed in my last visit. I'm from Chicago and come out to Scottsdale almost once a month, and make it a point to come here every trip because I love the food. I made reservations almost a week ahead of time to celebrate three birthdays. The hostess was extremely pleasant, and seated us at what was a table for a maximum of 3 people (we had a party of 9). The settings were crammed together, and it was basically a joke to be seated at that table. I went over to the hostess to let her know that we have 9 people coming in for dinner, and she said they are working on getting us another table, which I was fine with. At that moment, the bus boy chimed in and said \"the guys at your original table are being d*cks and wont move\". When our new table was ready, it turned out that it was another table, three feet away from our 3 person table, and we were not able to move the two tables together because they are bolted down to the ground. Not only was the second table 3 feet away from our other table, but there was a large party sitting next to that table as well, and they were piling over into our table.  At this point I asked to speak to the manager Mr. Hanson, and he basically made it seem like it was my problem, and not his. I asked him politely if there was anything else that he could do to get us seated as soon as possible, and he kept brushing me off and told me that if I didn't like it, I could leave. I am extremely disappointed in the lack of regard for what was clearly an issue. I would have been happy to wait by the bar while the situation was rectified, but there was ZERO effort put in to try to correct the problem.  Most definitely will not be coming back here.  PS- We did leave and had a FANTASTIC dinner at Mastros, where the customer service was above and beyond.",

    "text": "It is not often that you write 400 reviews on Yelp so I wanted to make this a special review for my 400th.   In short (TL:dr): Geisha was shit.  I came here with my girlfriend before hitting up the rest of Old Town. In general, we are simple people. Don't let my water be empty and you'll probably get a 20% tip. Almost 75% of my reviews are 4-star or 5-star reviews. It pains me to give negative reviews - truly - but I'll break it down why Geisha was a severe disappointment.  DECOR: The decor is pretty cool and sadly was probably one of the better items of my visit.  ATMOSPHERE: Dark and kind of romantic.  FOOD/DRINKS: Pretty good. I got three rolls and the girlfriend got one. Standard Asian brew.  SERVICE: The service was some of the worst I've experienced. The girlfriend and myself actually started a timer that if we were not helped or talked to - we were going to walk out.  We sat at the bar in what I would say was the brightest lit area - we couldn't be missed. There were three bartenders behind the bar and I think that it took them a solid 3 minutes (no joke) to even come over and say hi or put down napkins. When we got the napkins dropped off she even said \"oh have we not greeted you?\" Nope, you sure haven't and that isn't why we have no menus, no napkins, and no drinks in front of us. So all we got after 3 minutes was two napkins - no water.  Another 3 minutes goes by and finally some water shows up and some menus. Well thanks - I was about to eat this napkin. I filled out what we wanted to eat on the paper and then waited. And waited. And watched all the bartenders talk to certain people at the bar for a good 5 minutes and paying no attention whatsoever to other patrons. This is when we started the timer - I mean if I have to ask people to take my money then it isn't worth it. I shouldn't have to shoot a flare gun off any time I need service.  So we are waiting. We are literally said, if they don't come in 2 minutes (after waiting for 3 already) then we are just going to bounce. I think we were 1:45 into that timer when they finally came over and took the paper. Thanks.  From the time to get the paper to get the food was also seemingly slow. I'd guess that we waited 20 minutes for our food. And of course, no attention given to see if we wanted more drinks or anything while we waited. It wasn't like the place was slammed either - nobody waiting to get in, multiple tables empty, and the bar was about 1/3 full (and half of them only drinking).  Even when I was eating the bartender just came over and without saying anything just poured the rest of my beer in the glass and took the bottle. In general I am pretty forgiving but being ignored almost the entire time I was there just to have my bottle emptied into my glass kind irked me (the bottle was keeping it colder than my glass, so I would only pour it in there a little at a time). Maybe if you asked me if you could do that... or you were being friendly with me the entire time then I wouldn't have minded. It kind of just felt like some stranger off the street came in, saw my bottle, poured it in a glass, and then walked off with my bottle without saying a word.  COST: Jeebus, I think this was my most expensive sushi bill in years - About $60 for two drinks and four basic rolls. Maybe I'm just cheap.  I read the other reviews that noted that the service was lacking and if there is anything you take from my review is that the service IS lacking. It is some of the worst service I've ever had. I've had better service at Dennys, Taco Bell, and Jack in the Box by far. I literally have no idea why some people like this place other than it is a trendy kind of cool place to hang out (and apparently have your bartender talk to you for 5 minutes while ignoring all other duties and patrons).  I'm promptly adding this place to my Yelp Blacklist.",

I wanna hit that high, yeah, yeah  Geisha A Go Go is great for Happy Hours and Sunday specials.  This place is on prime real estate in the heart of Oldtown Scottsdale.  The place is still a rock and roll hall of fame kind of decor mixed with some anime-like feel.  I usually come for drinks and to meetup with friends to start the night before heading out.  Needless to say, it's still the same way.  I don't eat here much but they do have some interesting rolls; Pokemon, Bye Bye Kitty, and Dragonball just to name a few.  We started with the basics of calamari, egg rolls, and some chicken wings; very basic is the key, but the chipotle aioli is always welcoming.  We progressed with some rolls starting with the Samurai Warrior, a rice-less roll wrapped by green rice paper within albacore, salmon, spicy tuna, shrimp, avocado, and snow crab, served with a garlic ponzu sauce.  Probably my favorite of the night since it was not too heavy, but the garlic ponzu sauce gave it a mouth watering punch.  The second roll we had was the Seared Salmon Special; again a rice-less roll with what seemed to be pretty much the same to me as the Samurai, but with less ingredients.    In the end, we ordered my basic spicy tuna rolls and sorts, but the drinks is why you come to Geisha A Go Go and also the Karaoke; which they opened it up to open mic nights.  No more renting rooms here, just get up and sing!  As for the drink I would say their most popular among women is the Hello Kitty; Japanese strawberry soda, citrus vodka mixed with infused sake.  For the guys, I say go with the infused sake.  They have everything from mango, pomegranite, blueberry, and cucumber lemongrass. - Enjoy!",

Seated at 6pm with ongoing orders placed as we went...wait for service was looonng!!! We didn't \"hunt\" down server and expected great deals. Nope! Tickets turned in time stamped. On top of no Military discount, they skimp with seconds after 7pm. Greasy food. Weird flavor and watered down drinks make this place a far cry from just a couple of years ago. Sad. Food came out at various times over 90 minutes, where we watched each other eat...never once eating together!! So-DO NOT Recomend!!! Manager Angelica stopped in and was a bit petty. Didn't listen. Talked over us & was fine w/a negative review. I guess common sense didn't come w/that Job Title...Just overall a BAD experience :-( Shame! Shame! Shame!",

    "text": "What happened to Geisha A Go Go is what I want to know. I had my 23rd birthday celebration there(7 years ago) and back then it was this awesome karaoke/sushi bar. The sushi was fresh, the drinks were amazing. A spot where you would get dressed up and enjoy the atmosphere. I finally made it back there, seven years later and oh boy, I was highly disappointed.   The place just has a dirty look/feel to it. We sat at the bar and behind the bar, all of the previously opened bottles of alcohol had paper cones on top of the bottle to create the illusion that they are actually covered. Ummm no. It looks cheap and unsanitary. You're charging $10+ for a drink and you can't afford containers with tops? Come on!  My boyfriend ordered one of the sake's and they brought him a sake cup that was dirty. He waved down the waiter and asked for a new cup and the waiter had the audacity to intensely examine the cup like he was lying. My boyfriend saw this and told him, \"there's a ring of dirt on it. I want another one.\" The fact that he had to point out and explain to him why he needed a clean cup to drink out of is beyond me.  We only had a couple of drinks because there was no way we were going to order food from there. I don't see this place being open for much longer. As for me, never again. I'm 100% sure my water cup was dirty because the water looked pink to me but my boyfriend didn't back me up on this so I'm doubting myself. It could be that I was just seeing things because I was highly uncomfortable with how dirty the place was overall.",

The employees are caught up in their own \"too hip\" vibe to remember that it takes more than the spoiled Scottsdale 20 somethings to make a place successful.  The sushi is fair at best.  Only saving grace is the old town location. We were almost out the door with an open table reservation at Ra before they could accommodate our request.  Probably should have moved on anyway. Since we're not part of the pick up crowd we'll find another place. Leave this one for the wanna-be bopper crowd.",

There is plenty of room for wheelchairs/powerchairs inside, though outside it's very tight and the tables are all very high.    The parking was ok, though I always seem to have to valet since I meet my friends right after work across town, and parking is gone around 7pm. I ordered a couple of the appetizers, the chicken lettuce wraps, which was putrid. So bad.  I left it. The other was dumplings, which could've been reheated. I read some pretty bad reviews on here about the food so, I had very low expectations but, a friend of mine likes the spot, so I went along with it.  Truly though, this is one and done for me.  I can't recommend it with so many other nice options in the area.",

First timers try: chicken gyoza, seared albacore Watch for: Nina and Emily  FOOD: lots of strong options and vegetarians say yum! Lots of great things and my vegetarian friends love their options. I recommend the chicken gyoza, seared albacore with TINY crispy onion strips, chicken yakisoba, squid salad, pork and veggie gyoza, and the shrimp tepanyaki but sub in the appetizer shrimp. Also good is the ramen. For rolls, the dragonball and the charlie sheen (always late and a total surprise) are interesting.  SERVICE: I like to sit at the bar. I always sit at the bar and the bartenders, especially Nina and Emily are sweet, fun and playfull. Many of my other favorites have moved on to Spanish Fly, owned by the same people along with Sting Ray and Jimmy Woos. Usually pretty fast, but on occasion the kitchen can slow down, so keep on them if you have been waiting long.  ATMOSPHERE: Must do stop for Sunday Nights. A must try for Sunday. I am there most Sundays at 9:15-10:15pm. Lots of beautiful people, lots of energy, and a perfect lead in to Sunday night carousing. Partly indoor partly outdoor main bar, Kareoke rooms, a very small sushi bar ledge and a two level floor set up that slightly elevates the back half of the restaurant. Oh, the big talk is the bidet in the bathroom. With lots of controls and services, your girlfriend may not be back from the restroom for a while... :)  AC Star Explanation: 5 star: you MUST try this place at all costs! 4 star: GREAT place! 3 star: good for variety, but there are a few better 2 star: avoid unless your date is excited to go here. 1 star: avoid even if your date suggests it...",

It has something for everyone and I've never had a bad experience. On my most recent visit, the server recognized me... I might have to cut back on my Geisha visits!  I just so happens, almost every time I go to Geisha its happy hour! Thats because their happy hour runs EVERY day from 4-7pm! Great deals are found here at happy hour... Half off all specialty drinks, infused saki and sho-chu (similar to saki), appetizers and maki. It ends up being $3-5 for pretty much anything on the happy hour menus. I've never had a bad drink here and I'm pretty sure I've tried them all. The sushi doesn't disappoint and the apps are great! You can't beat their Spicy Yellowtail roll at $2.50. On the apps list, I highly recommend the Teriyaki Ribs. These lil pieces of pork heaven have a delicate teriyaki flavor and are so tender they fall off the bone. And they're only $5 on happy hour. =)  This place also has private karaoke rooms. They have small rooms that hold up to 10 ppl and a large room that holds up to 20. Karaoke rooms are $75 and $150 an hour, respectively. And Get this... The rooms are HALF OFF during Happy Hour too!!  So if you can talk your friends into singing a few tunes, the shared cost of karaoke is minimal at these times.   Everyone I've introduced to Geisha loves it and I hope you do too!   p.s. Geisha, keep up the good work and don't change a thing.",

Maybe I'm just being a snob (I am kind of a snob; full disclosure) but I feel like it's a little run down and old. It doesn't smell musty but it's one of those places that look like it could. Also, it's not like it's cheap; usually you'll spend about $40 bucks for two people I mean that's not a lot by old town standards but considering the sushi is ho hum and it feels a little old and like it hasn't been renovated in awhile I personally don't think it's worth it. When I go out to eat in Old Town I expect nice decor and delicious and this place just doesn't do it for me.",

But everything ELSE considered, it winds up a solid 3 stars.  Seems like there are a few people that had a rocky start with their dining experience at Geisha A Go Go- such was also the case with our group.   It was Saturday night and we were asked to relocate to another table shortly after being seating because another party, that was already seated and enjoying their sushi, preferred our location. I know, strange... to cut my venting about That to a minimum- we did eventually get menus, a server, and water... yay.  DJ was amazing- better than the club we ended up going to! Mixed B.E.P.s, Tupac, a lil Biggie Smalls... perhaps a lil Britney :). Bathrooms were also unique, contemporary, and clean. The Lettuce Wrap App with all of the Tasty dipping sauces is a great decision.  A poor dinner choice is the scallop bento box... Three scallops. Needless to say I regretted not getting sushi.  Instead of dining here, I would unregrettably recommend G.A.G.G. as a chill venue to kick-it.

We made sure to let them know ahead of time that the check would be split in 4 ways but the server was too overwhelmed because it was too many tables for her to manage (understandable). We tried to be patient but it took us 4 hours to eat and get our checks. There was a party next to us experiencing the same thing. The first roll came out 1.5 hours apart from the  last roll. We waited over an hour for our check. We talked to the manager and he said it was our fault for not putting it all on one check. I can't even believe how awful the service was. I will never return.",

    "text": "Finally getting around to writing this review.  We normally come here as our pre game dinner spot before hitting the town.  Totally love the vibe of this place, really gets you in the mood.  They have a DJ that plays a lot of mixes that you hear from bars and clubs around .  This place gets super busy on weekends and sundays so expect to wait a bit.  We were told a 40 minute wait for our group of 7 so we waited at the bar, however it must have been a shorter time than that or time just flew while we were too busy having fun.  The hostess did inform me that we are able to call ahead for our party in the future so we can avoid waiting, will make sure to do so next time.     I must say in the past the service has been so so or not too great,  which is probably why I never care to really write a review cuz my review would be mixed cuz I love this place and the food, but the service was ok.  However our server this time, Alleyne was awesome.  She was really friendly and patient with us.  She recommended we try one of the unfiltered sake, which of course after a couple shots I've now forgotten the name, it was yummy and not gross like I imagined sake to be.  We normally stick to the boring spicy tuna and california rolls, but she helped us pick out some other sushi rolls that were amazing.  My personal favorites was the salmon special and the Bye Bye Kitty.  Overall all our whole experience was fantastic because of her great customer service, thanks again to our server!!   I highly recommend this place!!!",

Even tho couples ordered on separate sushi menus and asked for separate checks she decided to put the whole table on the same bill and seemed confused why we would want her to split it up? She said she had no clue who ordered what. So spend 15 min figuring out the total for 10 different people. Wasn't impressed at all",

It was a boring Monday, and we needed a place to go after dinner. We didn't really feel like walking all the way down to 1st street, so we stopped here for some drinks.  Not a bad place. The crowd seemed kinda meh, but if you are with the right person or people, who cares. There are private Karaoke rooms. I plan on making a scene someday soon.  Drinks are reasonably priced. I can't really speak for the food since we didn't come here for that, and no one around us had food either. Hmm.   My one gripe is they don't have Sapporo on draft. WTF!? For shame. I don't even like Sapporo, but I figured it would be a safe bet since this was a \"Sushi\" place. Oh well.   The cocktail menu looked creative. I'd come back for drinks.",

    "text": "**HAPPY HOUR DELIGHTS AND TASTY BITES**  We didn't think too much of this so-called Japanese restaurant in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale.  Yes, we had low expectations.  But lo and behold, when the clock struck 4PM, there were some marvelous drinks and apps for 1/2 off.   The vibe was young, hip, and happening. Pretty bartenders (Victoria was her name) and good service.   Water refills, menu suggestions, and laughter were abundant.  ORDERED:  *RIBS - Favorite app by far. Off-the-bone, greasy deliciousness. *DRAGON ROLL - Didn't care too much for this. Not colorful, boring. *SPICY TUNA ROLL - For 1/2 off, worth your while to add this to the menu. *FRESH EEL ROLL - Liked this one, too. Tasted fresh. *EDAMAME -Pretty tasty and addictive.  DRINKS:  *HELLO KITTY - Skyy Citrus and Japanese Strawberry Soda mixed with Fruit Infused Sake was REFRESHING to say the least. Good way to start the Happy Hour.  *HARAJUKU LOVER - Grey Goose Pear Vodka and Sparkling Sake was also refreshing. I didn't like it as much as the last and third drink of the night.  *TURNING JAPANESE - Stoli Gala Applik, Peach Schnapps, and Organic Pear and Apple Juices with a Squeeze of Lime was my favorite cocktail of the evening. Good stuff man.  I also tried my friend's KINKI KOOLER which tasted like a Jolly Rancher. Very sweet and very good.   Our bill at the end of the night was cheap and ridiculous.  They also have a sick-ass private karaoke room with a stripper pole in the back. Trouble much?   Oh, their bathrooms featured toilets that basically did everything, including warming one's butt.  RECOMMEND the HAPPY HOUR (4-7PM), karaoke, and bathrooms!",

I keep my sushi simple but friends like the spider rolls and one friend doesn't like seaweed so he gets his choice rolls on rice paper as substitute.  Only thing I don't like here is waiting, they should have chairs or stools outside while you wait. Not everyone wants to wait at the bar for a table.  Good happy hour!

Literally says that word for word. Obviously, I'm not ordering pappy or some 200 year aged bottle of wine. After waiting 10 minutes for anyone to greet us, we told the waitress we were here for industry night and then asked for sake bombs with cold sake. The girl asked if I wanted some sake with a weird name so I told her whichever one works, being under the impression that every \"DAMN DRINK\" is half off. After dealing with slow service the whole meal, we get our checks and the sake isn't discounted on a couple of our checks. We told the waitress about it and she proceeded to say \"oh, what's industry night? I've never even heard of that.\" Then, she sent the manager over and as I'm explaining to him what I just explained here and our conversation with the waitress, he says \"I have no idea the conversation that happened between you two\"......IM TELLING YOU THE CONVERSATION. Like what bro? It's just unprofessional as hellllll. And instead of fighting me on it, you should pacify the situation and accept the fact that: 1- you have False advertisement and 2- your server doesn't know what the hell is going on so maybe as a manager you should reconcile the situation. And I still tipped the waitress fat because I'm not a douche. But y'all need a new manager and maybe a better training system. And some new menus that specify what the hell is actually discounted.

The Happy Hour is fantastic, and since we realized that the HH was still in effect when we arrived, we ordered promptly.

The food was awesome BUT the rolls that are affected by happy hour are very much alike, and that's cool. The appetizers I had was all great. Just deliciously unhealthy and tasty. The rolls was good, but we ordered too much food and by the end I was just stuffed.   I will definitely come back here, both for happy hour and not.

Giant portraits of rock legends Jimi Hendricks, Jim Morrison, and Sid Vicious. But again, greeted by no one when we sat at the bar. Waitress walked past us without a smile or any kind of acknowledgment.  Finally was able to place an order, but it was like talking to a brick wall trying to order. You would think a waitress working at a sushi restaurant would take at least five minutes to educate herself on the menu. Oh, and never asked for a drink order. I'm sitting at the bar, I think that means that I want to drink. All in all the waitress did not seem interested in helping us. We came in on a Wednesday night, not busy or packed.  The food...... Some of the blandest, tasteless sushi ever. I could have gotten better sushi at a bait shop. Completely lacking in flavor, taste, and flare.

You can get a reallllyyyy good buzz for not a lot of money!  The waitresses can sometimes be slow/forget about a table. I've experienced this only a few times, so I'm sure it's not the norm, but it does happen. Parking in downtown can be troublesome in evenings and weekends so be prepared for that. Call ahead if you have a large group or planning to come during a busy hour",

The music is good and a healthy level to give a good ambiance while still being able to hold a conversation without yelling. The decor is fun and unique and they have private karaoke rooms you can rent. Happy hour prices are good with a good selection of items included and the food is good and well portioned. I'll definitely bring going here again.",

Happy hour is at a great time as well running from 3pm to 7pm which is manageable for people who work all day. Not to mention happy hour all day on Sunday! The staff was incredible and service was fast as well as classy. The vibes inside this place are very warm and welcoming. Overall a great atmosphere to enjoy sushi in! The sushi itself tasted delightful and fresh so no complaints there. I will definitely be coming back to this establishment again and again. I have already recommended this place to friends. This is a place every sushi lover needs to try!",

    "text": "This was my second time here, the first time was for HH on a Sunday, and then last night.  I decided to leave a review this time, because the service wasn't any better last night than the first visit. On our first visit we ordered a couple sushi rolls and a few other items, plus drinks. Drinks were good! However, we waited awhile for the food to be served and when the waitress finally brought out our order, that's when she let us know that one of the ingredients for a roll was out. It would have been nice to know this before hand so we could have chosen another item in place of it. After we received our food, it was hard to get her back to our table to order anything else.  Last night was the wrong order, slow wait for the correct order, as well as slow wait for drinks. Oh yeah, let's not forget the sticky dirty table! Had to ask for a wet rag to wipe it down. Waitress was a bit miffed that I asked, she said she'll do it herself. Question... Why couldn't she see it, check table herself before asking us what we wanted to drink?? Isn't that a general basic in the restaurant business to sit a customer at a clean table!!! UGH!!!!! I get that it's a very busy establishment, but the manager should  make sure that the kitchen has enough of ingredients for the food being put out! Also, make sure there's enough help on the busy nights, or shifts. Not sure we'll try a third time.",

Dirty (tables are sticky, soy sauce container desperately needs to be wiped off), booths uncomfortable, sushi sub-par (j-pop, spicy tuna, dragonball), salads bad (sunomono had no cucumber and uchi was drowning in a creamy dressy), service not so hot (waited so long to order we eventually walked it up to the bar, ordered 4 rolls but only received 3, never got a refill on our water). The drinks sounded interesting, but the chikorita was way too sweet and the karaoke cowboy just tasted like bad whiskey and simple syrup watered down with cheap ice.   This place is just not for me, will leave it for the rest of the downtown Scottsdale party crew.",

I got my food first, but my friend got his food at least 10 mins afterwards. In sum, we ordered edamame, chicken gyoza, chicken lettuce wraps, and the chicken geisha gogo bowl. The edamame wasn't fresh, the gyoza was oily, the lettuce for the wraps - they didn't bother wringing out the water, the chicken itself was soupy, the chicken bowl was over sauced and in big clusters.  Would I go back? Probably not. What about happy hour? Why- so I can get small portions of bad food? No thanks.",

It was refreshing; about half the drink is alcohol, but you can't tell.. served in a tall glass- $12 reg, 1/2 off at HH. It was good- exactly what you'd expect, but nothing over the top. I then switched to Kim Crawford Sauv Blanc- my go to $10.50 a glass here. Also ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. They were ok- the hot mustard they're served with will light your mouth and nostrils on !! Be careful with how much you add. Also served with two other sauce options. It's a filling meal and only about $6 at HH. Bartender highly recommended the rock shrimp app- really regret not trying it! All apps are 1/2 off at HH. Enjoy!",

Half off apps, house maki and house cocktails? Cant beat it. At night, this place fills up and the music gets a bit louder, definitely a spot to come for drinks before a night out in OT, or a spot you should stop on your night out for some flavored sake.   Our fav cocktails: blushing geisha, shiso horny Apps: rockin shrimp, pork gyoza, (new) snow grab mozz sticks \"Lighter fare\" sushi: seared salmon special is TO DIE FOR.   Love this place.

Or a late night place to score some decent sushi since not many other places are still serving food past 10pm ...  This is probably the go-to place for happy hour, and the best way to describe happy hour here is: \"a party in your mouth!\"  A few of my favorite must eat/drink are:  1) the ribs and 2) the house made saki (love the pomegranate & the mango!).  The sushi here is just alright for me ... Nothing amazing, but not horrible either.  I went there with a few friends the other day and we got a ton of food/drinks and our bill was a mere $60 - gotta love it!  The decor is cool I like it .... The service can be hit or miss.  I have had some decent service here and some absolutely horrid service here (mostly because it's a lot of youngsters working here)   The music is cool though ... They always have a DJ rockin' the house...   Overall, I would recommend geisha to others ... Just don't be expecting some super high end sushi place - this place is more chill, relaxed, etc. Do I like it? Yes! Do I love it? Ehhhh it's okay/cool - check it out for yourself and enjoy the happy hour recommendations!!",

Another member of our party ordered a tuna dish and found the tuna to be sour (ew!). The sushi selection was dismal. Everything tasted like it was dirty. Every sushi roll had its own realm of disappointment. Not to mention our service was below par. We waited for 20 minutes just to ask another server for our check. When our server returned she RUDELY said that we had been ignoring her every time she came to our table when we had been clearly waiting on her for 20 min. It was all around a terrible experience and I do not recommend especially if you like good (fresh) sushi.",

The music's always HAPPENING and the drinks are plenty cheap and constantly a-pouring, I swear if I could choose my heaven I think Geisha would be it... (hmmm that can either mean i wanna party it up or I am that crassy?)! Anywho, I celebrated my birthday at Geisha last October and got myself the largest karaoke room available to fit my guestlist of 20. Now, they say that the room can fit 20 but I think they fail to mention... maybe 20 skinny Japanese not 20 american adults. lol. I got the room for half price since my bday was on a sunday (i later found out and not sure if it has always been but you can get a karaoke room free on your bday, score! not for me =( )   Anyways, karaoke room at half off with some free apps, and a server that handled my group's orders, and with all day hh going on and 2 hours of fun and bad singing = hella good fun! I loved that the total of the bill split amongst people came out to around $210 excl. the room, lots of cocktails were had and soooooooooo many orders of teriyaki ribs. And this is why I adore Geisha, the apps don't suck, the rolls are yummy, the drinks delicious and the atmosphere cannot be beat. I always rave about this place and I think the consequence is that this place gets even more crowded every Sun I come here. still in love with you Geisha!!",

I'm a big fan of their kinky kooler to drink. The pot stickers and teriyaki ribs are awesome. All of the sushi I've tried so far has been fresh and tasty.   There's a reason they call it happy hour, because it truly is the happiest hour of them all especially at Geisha. The music is rocking, the ambiance is cool, and the drinks are free flowing...err...maybe not free but half off is a pretty good deal!  If you want a decent place to sit, get there early as it gets really crowded from 5-7. This is a place I frequent while in Scottsdale.",

The drinks were a bit pricey at around $10 for a martini, but that's pretty average for Old Town. The karaoke selection was pretty big and the sound system was good. There's also a stripper pole in the room, so everyone can place bets on how many drinks it will take before the men start practicing their moves. The average for our party was 2.5.",

The Hello Kitty cocktail is good. Kind of creamy and sweet. Pretty pink girlie drink. They have great sake infusion flavors. I've had a handful of appetizers. All good for the prices. The house rolls are half off on happy hour. They aren't the best in town but like I've said, the price is right. However we went yesterday and this was the first time I really wasn't impressed. The fish was kind of gray and it just didn't taste fresh. I probably should have spoken up, but I didn't. And I feel fine today. So that's what matters. The thing I don't like about this place is the atmosphere. It's dark and sort of dingy, especially in the summer when it's too hot to sit outside. Also it is the quint essential Scottsdale douchebag joint. Big groups of bros and twenty something girls trying too hard and getting drunk at 3pm. Not the classiest of crowds. I think the place needs a facelift. My fiance came here is 2011 and said it hasn't changed. I will probably go back when the weather is nice again but sitting inside just doesn't cut it for me. It's just depressing.",

Being in the middle of the desert, I wasn't expecting the best fish, so I ordered a shrimp tempura roll. I figured they could thaw out some frozen shrimp, deep fry it up and it'd be good enough. I literally had to choke it down because it was that bad.  A sip of water with every bite helped a bit. Oh, but then again, the waitress only refilled our water ONE time in an hour span. So there's that. I'd like to mention that I was with 'Michelle C.' who wrote a fabulous review as well, so I'd love if you read that before giving your money to this restaurant.

We were greeted with one server when we sat down in the private karaoke room who did not return for at least 30 minutes. There wasn't any instruction on the room , how to order, no greeting, or literally no information on how to use the karaoke machine. We had a group of 12 girls we were fully prepared to tip well, and order a LOT of food and alcohol. The server never refilled my water even though we asked more than 2-3 times. I got charged for an extra roll that we didn't order and our food came all at completely different times. There was never any apologies, or empathy about how long the food took to come, and on top of that, before 3 girls in our party even got to order they told us we were no longer allowed to order food... The server would come MAYBE every 30 minutes and would only ask maybe one or two people if they were good, and not actually ask the whole room what they wanted. The server was so unprofessional, and some of the worst service we have ever received. To top if off we were told we would need to spend $200, but we were charged an extra room charge for $200. This was never put in writing, or told to our friend that booked the room before. When we approached the managers about it, the manager continued to berate and yell at both girls in our party that asked him for more information. Scott was completely rude and unprofessional. He repeatedly said to our party.. \"I WILL be getting my $200 from you.\" I can not believe that he wouldn't work with us at all, and wouldn't even agree to a professional conversation. We were willing to pay the fees if it was what was discussed, but the way it was handled was completely out of line. I will tell everyone I know to stay away from this restaurant and have already shared my experiences about it to every one i know. I've always heard if you have a good experience you share it with one person, if you have a terrible experience you tell the whole world. Scott could have diffused the situation so easily because clearly the staff miscommunicated the wrong thing to us, but instead he was incredibly rude and pointing fingers at us. The best part was... his way to \"make it right\" was taking the gratuity off the bill. That made his server lose out on over 300 dollars worth of tips... real nice boss huh?   The whole situation was honestly so unbelievable, and I'm still leaving out so many details of other things that had happened. Stay as far away as possible to this place. Anyone that treats their staff, and customers this way does not deserve to be in business. Also -- if i could give this place zero stars i would but they are making me pick atleast one star.... ridiculous.",

    "text": "Geisha is easily one of my favorite places to get sushi in the Valley. From their happy hour prices, to the quality of their fish, Geisha just can't be beat.  Ambience: 70s hip rock 'n roll vibe, lots of teak and green. There's mostly rock that plays on the radio, however it doesn't detract from conversation or your meal. For seating, there's patio seating, table seating, and booth seating. Oh, and the bar.  Service: honestly, I could dock a star for service. The last time we were here, our waitress was a bit cold. She seemed more interested in herself than her job or our lunch. This place is heavily frequented and staffed by your typical Scottsdale snobbery. She neglected to tell us that happy hour is all day on Sundays, and we only found out because we overheard it at the table next to ours. She also removed our chicken lettuce wraps from the table before we finished. That being said, I did notice that the waiter at the table next to us was very helpful, polite and friendly. So perhaps we just got a bad egg.  Food: both times that I've been to Geisha, I've had the pleasure of enjoying their happy hour prices. For appetizers, I would recommend the chicken lettuce wrap, the short ribs, or the tempura. I've tried all three and can say that I would happily order all three again. As for the rolls, I would recommend the spicy yellowtail roll. We've ordered other rolls in the past, and remember them being just as good and fresh.  Price: I can't say when their happy hour is midweek, but I can tell you that happy hour is all day on Sundays! Happy hour includes half off all appetizers, house rolls, draft beers, and other things that I can't remember at this time. The normal price of their roles is comparable to any other sushi establishment in the valley, but their happy hour prices are definitely something to go in for. The normal price on appetizers is a bit steep for my taste, but definitely worth their value on happy hour.   And so, to sum: Geisha has fantastic happy hours on Sundays and I wouldn't miss it if I was in the area.",

Emily (if this was really her name, we asked for our servers name and the hostess stuttered a bit, so not too sure if Emily is accurate) she is typically is always in the back room/private area. Her personality is horrible, her service is horrible, she sat on her cell phone about 90% of the time and we were her only table for at least three hours. On top of that she has a little helper following her every footstep and he was just as bad as she was. We would politely ask about our food order and it wouldn't come, we would ask her again after some time where our food was and she said it was coming. Then 45 minutes went by and we would ask again and she went straight to the computer to put in the order which probably means she didn't put it in in the first place. A spicy tuna roll is the simplist of sushi rolls, shouldn't take that long to get. It seems like a pattern with this place and specifically her by reading other reviews, tip is already added...20% so they don't care at all! Sad, we come here multiple times a month and have decided to NEVER come back because of this last experience this past weekend! Even more disappointing is management and the owners must not be keeping up with the reviews because from others I have spoken to seems like a pattern with this same server/bartender and always in the private/karaoke room. I would give zero stars if it was possible!",

I have never been,more honest or sincere when I say I'll advocate not just against geisha a go go but anything that is ran by Bryan Chittendon I have never been wronged that badly, a service dog is not something you have for good reasons this was so immoral so unethical and inhumane   The sushi was was mediocre at best and priced as though it, was the best, some of it was extremely fishy, staff always treated me so kindly so well ( because they loved my dog partially lol) but thats ok this place can stay but Bryan. Chittendon should go.",

The music was seemingly loud for 7:45 on a Wednesday and still couldn't drown out the vulgar and volume of the three tables surrounding our family. I counted 30-or-so f-bombs in the time it took our appetizers to arrive. Goyaza was fab, edamame was hot fresh and salty. But when the party of 6 at the neighboring table began slamming their fists on the table to emphasize cackling laughter, along with a expletive that made all three kids look up, we got up, paid our check and left. I was bummed; it would have been great to try the original- if a little precocious/hoitytoity- rolls.   Be warned. This isn't a family friendly restaurant! This is frat bro/sorority sis land. Better off going to p f chiangs",

    "text": "My girlfriends and I were so excited to come here for girls night out. We were going to do karaoke, eat sushi and drink saki bombs aka have a GREAT time. We reserved one of the private karaoke rooms so we could sing all of our favorite songs judgement free. When we arrived and gave our name to the hostess we were escorted to our \"karaoke room\", there are not enough words to describe this room. It is nothing like the pictures online and our waitress even said the pics online are out of date. The smallest room, which is what we  reserved for $100, is about 10ftx10ft and that's a generous measurement. There's a DISGUSTING couch in there that is cracked and heavily used and scratch/scrape marks all along the walls. In front of the couch is a coffee table to eat off of and a small entertainment center directly in front of that with a karaoke program that you operate yourself. We would've been better off and more comfortable doing karaoke at someone's home since there wasn't even enough room to stand and sing in our tiny little panic room.   We let our waitress know immediately that we were not comfortable in the karaoke room we reserved and we no longer wanted to use the room. She spoke with her manager and even though we weren't using the room we still had to pay $100 for our last minute cancellation. I understand that they could've booked someone else in that room but, who would've wanted to be in there? It is quite possibly the most uncomfortable room I have ever been in. On top of that, we also had to bargain with the manager (who never even approached us to apologize for the misunderstanding) to have the gratuity removed from our $100 bill.   Needless to say, our girls night out left much to be desired. We went from so excited and willing to drop way more than $100 on a great evening to just getting 1 sushi roll each and 1 drink and leaving.   Impressions of Geisha A Go Go- Poor customer service, False advertising, mediocre sushi.  We will not be returning.",

It would get a 5 star in my book if it wasn't for their staff. Always a little slow to the punch and NEVER smile or seem friendly. Bartenders tend to com  across as a little rude sometimes. I wish there were more karaoke rooms as they tend to never be available :( Highly recommended if you want great priced, yummy food in a fun environment that's close to all the hot night life!  Update: this is SERIOUSLY not the place to go if you're looking for any type of service. I waited 10 minutes before the server even came over to say hello. I watched 2 tables who were sat after me get drinks and food going before anyone even came over. It was very disappointing to say the least",

There was eight of us and she only spoke to the four near the front of the table. She didn't even take the order of the four of us sitting at the end, we had to track her down and tell her what we wanted. She didn't ask if we wanted to order drinks, and didn't even bring us water. They delivered our orders all wrong, and were not even aware of what dish was which. At one point, the waitress came up to me, asked \"is this the California roll?\" and when I said yes, she grabbed what was remaining of my dinner and took it away. The sushi was good the last time I was here, but this time, whether it be because of the bad customer service or not, it was not even appealing. I get that this is Scottsdale, but if you're going to have a snobby, bad attitude don't be a waitress.",

The chicken gyoza is amazing, and I always get two orders for myself.  It comes with a chipotle aioli, but I always add a little Sriracha.  Their specialty rolls are delicious, and they have the most creative names like Dragonball and Bye Bye Kitty.  The sake flavors are always changing.  Some of my favorites have been pumpkin (seasonal), spicy mango, pineapple, and pomegranate.  Another fantastic draw for me to this place is that their happy hour is 7 days a week and is a nice 4 hours long.  Some places do a lame 2 hour happy hour and your rushing to get there, and make it on time.  I can't say enough good things about this place.",

Incredibly loud music managed to drown out any real conversation, and I am also assuming this is why the service wasn't that great - I don't think the waitress could hear us.  On top of the overly loud music, there were TV's playing sports everywhere, which really detracted from the atmosphere of the room.  Neat features like rocks in the middle of the room that added charm and a zen like calmness were overshadowed by the visions of football coming at you from every direction.  Geisha A Go Go - you don't need to be a sports bar, karaoke bar, night club and sushi restaurant all in one....  The food was good, and they had some sushi rolls that looked pretty interesting.  I went with the tepanyaki, which was quite tasty, and very filling and a good value for the price.  The service was interesting, long waits for drinks, and the food was brought out in no apparent order.  Appetizers appeared after full meals, and the easier items like lettuce wraps appeared a full 15 minutes after the tepanyaki box was put in front of me.  I would like to go and check out their private karaoke rooms someday, but as far as just going out for a social evening, this one will hit the bottom of my list.",

    "text": "Tried out the happy hour  with a few friends and they do have some really great happy hour specials!   I don't know if the sushi was mediocre in comparison or if the bathrooms were really so great ...but the bathrooms were my favorite part of Geisha. Who doesn't like smart toilets that open and shut for you (no more kicking the lid up with my shoe) and the seat is even heated! Just like the heated seats in my car. There was a whole panel on the wall for more advanced options, which I did not explore but appreciated the possibilities ;)   Eating sushi at Geisha is like eating sushi in an Austin Powers movie. Shag carpet, low couches, very retro feeling.   Not the best sushi or the best drinks but for the happy hour special prices its very worth checking out!  (or just to use the bathrooms)  :)",

    "text": "Definitely recommend renting a private karaoke room if you get the chance. It was the perfect birthday experience and my family and I had so much fun. The room was definitely pricey but in general, you aren't gallavanting around Scottsdale w/o money. They definitely don't exaggerate when they warn you the rooms are small, think large walk in closet size for the smaller rooms. My intimate party of 8 fit ok but definitely don't think a bunch of strangers would feel comfortable in this small room. The larger room can accommodate many more people and has the disco lights and stripper pole. The waitress to our room was very helpful and accommodating. It must be tought to work in such a high energy/fast paced/drunken/loud environment so definitely props to them. The machine worked fine and after a couple hours and one too many sake bombers, you're not even singing the same song on the screen anyway. The song selection was huge! Lots of fun and easy to use. I wish they would put two books in the rooms though so multiple people can look it over and pick songs simultaneously.   Food wise, my favorite were the short ribs. It came with our appetizer platter and we ended up ordering another plate of it. Possibly one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. The edamame was really good too. Everyone in the party enjoyed the myriad of sushi they ordered although I myself am not a big sushi fan.",

When we got there the hostess said there was a wait of about 30- 45 mins so we just sat and had drinks at the bar and jammed to  the music. Then about 15 mins later a table was ready for us and we were drinking and eating. My boyfriend ordered lettuce wraps and 3 plates of different sushi and I ordered fried rice, I dont really do sushi, and he enjoyed every last bite. For drinks altogether we had one sake bomb, one matini, and 2 crafts of flavored sake and for all the food and drinks it only cost about $40. Im really cheap but I thought that was great considering all the food my boyfirend ordered.  The only downfall was that I left my sweater at the bar after we relocated to our dining table and when I realized it was missing it was nowhere to be found.",

I had the only Chardonnay they offer and the second glass tasted pretty off like it was old.  I had each one of my friends at the table take a small sip and everyone agreed there was something wrong with it. When I told our server she took the wine and said she would bring me a new one and she did.  A few minutes later the \"manager\" came over and was asking \"who had the wine\" and he had an attitude about the way he asked. He wanted to let ME know that it was the same wine and nothing was wrong with the first one. I said well it tasted off and instead of apologizing he proceeded to tell me it was the exact same... pretty much trying to make me look stupid.  Definitely wont be back unless its happy hour and I won't be getting any wine. I am giving one star for management. The food and other service would be about 3 stars...",

    "text": "I went here with a group for a bridal shower and rented one of the private rooms.  Now, we knew this was Scottsdale, so it would be expensive, but generally, I've never had a \"bad\" experience in Scottsdale as a result.  Well, this was it.    The room wasn $75 an hour and boy was tiny- it said for 10, but we had 10 people and at least two had to sit on the floor the entire time.  We were supposed to get a $75 tray with the room and it came with three 1/2 order apps and three rolls- all with crab.  Now, if I added it up according to the menu, there was no way it came to that value.    The karoke song menu was marginal, lots of duplicate songs and songs with tracks that we had never heard- despite knowing the song line by line.   On top of that, the service was terrible- the waitress kept coming in to refill our water, but we had to practically demand her to take a drink or food order. Then, when we got our drinks, there were only 3 people who found their drink good- or even palatable- and matched what was stated/shown on the drink menu.  The sushi tray was OK at best, and although two people did order sushi and say it was OK, the rolls were loosely done.  The two salads we got were not very good at all.  The cobb salad had a lot of toppings, but very little dressing and the lettuce was weird.  Not sure how, but it was.   The ceasar salad was dry and tasteless according to my friend.   I would never go back again nor would I reccomend anyone else to go back either.",

Went at happy hour for a friends birthday.  We ordered what seemed liked everything on the menu and everything was delish and nothing broke the bank.  Very pleased.  Im not a sushi snob in anyway as you can see I like almost every place I go to. However, do to the fact that they have great food, waitresses, great bathrooms, and a pic of Jimi Hendrix at the bar this place easily gets 4 stars.  Only reason I wont give it 5 is I have been here at night and the place has gotten too crowded and that gets annoying.  4 1/2 stars",

    "text": "Nothing is especially bad about Geisha A Go Go, but nothing is especially great, either.  I was expecting from the way this place was hyped by Phoenix Magazine to be something truly special, even outrageous:  JPop on the TV Screens, staff that made a point to act as if they were in a Tokyo bar with all the attendant crazy fashions and giggly attitude, and drinks that were something out of this world.  While Geisha is pretty and very friendly, it certainly isn't anything unusual or exciting-- it's really just another Scottsdale Sports Bar with some Dark Colors  and Japanese Calligraphy hanging on the walls.  The food is just ok, but hardly in the same league as Stingray. The drinks aren't any more interesting than those at your local Bamboo Grill, despite the cutesey names.  And Phoenix Magazine had said in a write up that the Pachinko Machines were the high point of the Geisha Experience -- what a disappointment to discover that they are merely decorative, and don't actually work.  WHY anybody would put out the outrageous amount of money they want for Bottle Service or the Private Karaoke booths when there are so many other far more interesting bars in Phoenix that offer the same stuff is beyond me, and I am very glad I went here just to hang with friends before I succumbed to that temptation.  Not worth a return visit, unless they ramp up their game quite a bit.",

That day, the hostess calls her and says that they don't take reservations and they might not be able to get us a table of 10. An hour before we leave, they call us again saying that we are all set to move forward with our original reservation. We happened to be 5 minutes late, literally 5 minutes and the \"hostess\" gave away our table. The nasty hostess insisted on arguing with us the entire time and saying, \"we don't take reservations!!\" And FINALLY  she said. \"we'll I guess we can put you outside.\"  So we're in, and we are hungry! Next comes the server... She told us that she couldn't do split checks and that they don't do that there! When we told her that SHE really didn't have an option, she now was able to split accordingly. The food wasn't too bad... But DEFINITELY, for a sushi bar in Scottsdale, it wasn't great. Way over priced. I will NEVER go back there again, and neither will the rest of the 9 girls that had went. As someone who has been in the industry for 10 years, I was embarrassed for everyone who had worked at this establishment.",

I've been here a ton of times to meet up with friends. If you are in a group larger than 4 people I would recommend calling to see if they can hold a table for you because its first come first serve and tables go quickly! The prices are reasonable and def cheap during Happy Hour, which is from 5-7 daily and all day Sunday for those of you who take part in Sunday Funday:) They recently expanded the patio so now there is a lot more seating available outdoors. Staff has always been good about seating my party and I quickly and also taking our order promptly. All specialty martinis are $5 during HH and they are filled up to the brim just the way they should be! My favorite martini is Turning Japanese, which is Stoli Gala Apple, pear juice, peach and lime, and by the time you finish it you may feel just that:) My all time favorite roll is the Seared Salmon Specials, which you can actually find on the appetizer section its DELISH! It also doesn't have any rice on it for those of you looking to cut out some carbs. This is what I recommend to all my friends as a MUST have! Overall, its a great HH spot in old town Scottsdale with well priced food and drinks:)",

We sat on the patio with the misters on, not the crazy kind that soak anything they touch, but they were perfect. The food was awesome! Price was very right as well. I think I had a spicy tuna roll, a caterpillar roll, and veggie gayoza and a cocktail for less than $15. Score!   I HAVE to tell you about our waitress as well, I believe her name was Lindsay. She was so helpful! Gave good recommendations, very attentive, and even when all eight of use were yelling out an order she got everything right! Go and request her!   Other than happy hour they have a pretty fun dance club after hours. They also have karaoke rooms. So much fun, you have to try it. They are private rooms, so you only have to make a fool of yourself in front of your close personal friends. Great for parties!   Have fun!",

    "text": "Geisha a go go When you walk pass a large oriental style door and old Japanese arcade games; you know you are in for unique experience. Geisha can be describe in its simplest form as a sushi bar for the young and wealthy; the young because there is loud music and a DJ, and the wealthy because the sushi was quite expensive. Trust me when I say that geisha has a lot more to offer with friendly staff, clean bathrooms, and a convenient location in the heart of old town Scottsdale. The presentation of some of the rolls is simply stunning. For example the caterpillar rolls looks as if it is snaking across my plate with tooth picks for eyes. This is just one of many examples of how the Sushi chefs here take their time in plating each and every roll. Carefully crafting rolls to excite your taste buds before the roll reaches your lips. Not only did they take their time on how the sushi looks also with their decor. With beer that is dyed and placed in large glass tubes or large photo photos of famous musician behind the bar. My parents have order several exotic drink specials that seem light up the room with their bright neon colors. There is also a large rock placed in the center of the room giving up valuable table space for the sake of aesthetics. On your way to the bathroom you may notice a private telephone booth adds to the unique feel that only Geisha can offer. The unique design doesn't stop there; it carried throughout the entire restaurant including multiple karaoke rooms. . I personal have been to about 7 or 8 sushi bars across the valley and none of them stack up to Geisha when it comes to freshness of ingredients. All of the fish is flavorful on its own and is only enhanced by combination of things you can add to the fish. I believe this can be partially attributed to the large number of people they serve on a daily bias. The ginger has a very clean taste leaving my pallet ready for the next round of rolls. The wasabi is spicy and fresh and brings the right amount of heat.  My typical meal at geisha would be some edamame to start, followed by a simple roll like a tuna, then moving on to the dragon roll (rice, cooked eel, avocado, and a sweet sauce on top). This would cost about 30 dollars during non-happy hour and 13 dollar during happy.  If there is one complainant that I have about Geisha it is that it can be very expensive. When my family and I went recently it was about 200 dollars for the 4 of us. This bill included appetizers, lots of rolls, and desert. This was plenty of food in fact it filled 2 teenage boys and 2 adults. However, Geisha has a great happy hour special which is 50% off all rolls.  Happy hour is always packed so expect to wait but I cannot really complain because of the great specials offered during this time. Once seated though you can expect to get your rolls fast and have a waiter nearby in case you need anything else.  I think Geisha is a great sushi bar not only for its food but for its appearance and overall atmosphere and would recommend Geisha to anyone looking for a great sushi bar.",

My cousin and I waited for 20 minutes for a table while empty tables waited for late reservations. I ordered the fries rice that is made with shrimp, chicken and beef. I do not eat chicken or beef mind you. Due to ordering the same thing every time I explained to the waitress I want the rice without the chicken or beef but I understand that does not mean an additional portion of shrimp. She returns to the table to let me know that it's possible to remove the chicken and beef but I'd have to pay full price instead of the happy hour price. Please tell me you all are as confused as I am! I looked at her and said \"because I don't eat those meats, and not requesting additional shrimp, I have to pay extra\". She said yes. \"Due to people having allergies and getting wrong orders in the past this is the new policy. I swear I couldn't make this up. I ordered something else doe to be hungry and already being there over 30 minutes. Sounds like to me the staff needs to be trained better on delivering orders, not make you customers pay more for less food! Sadly, I'll be finding a new fav.",

    "text": "The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the wait staff was pleasant and polite and the food was good.  Other than that, I would never recommend this place to anyone, nor would I go there again, and here's why...  When I had called to make my reservation for the private karaoke room, I was told that there was a room large enough for 20 people.  We had 18 people and the room was insanely small and cramped. Several of the members of our party wouldn't even come into the room bc they said it was too small and they were claustrophobic. It was my birthday party and I sat on the floor to eat because there was no place to sit with only 16 people in the room. But this wasn't the most disappointing thing.  I LOVE karaoke and was most concerned with that part of the night so I was willing to overlook the tight space.  Being that this establishment is known for its Karaoke, I assumed I'd be able to jam out to tunes from The Greatest Showman and A Star is Born, two movies which were released LAST YEAR, but I was quickly made aware that I'd have no recent song choice options...the song selection was extremely outdated, and to make matters worse, some of the songs we found in the book that we settled on wouldn't even play! We would select a song, and it would just make a super loud buzzing noise that made the cramped quarters even more uncomfortable.  We asked for a round of waters and it took the waitress being asked at least 2-3 times to bring them to us, and the mess from our food and drinks was not cleared away the entire night, after we politely requested the room to be tidied up, especially because there was absolutely NO ROOM to set anything from purses and such, let alone our drinks.   I ended up being super embarrassed for inviting my birthday party guests here. I do a karaoke birthday party every year and can almost guarantee no one will come if I tried having my party here again next year, that is not unless they make some drastic improvements. My recommendations would be to limit that room to 10-12 people MAX, and to invest in updating their karaoke system.   I would have tried complaining the night of the party because I was so disappointed when I was brought the bill of over $400 (for my husband and I and one other couple - the other guests paid their own bills) but I didn't want my night to be ruined any more than it already had been. So I'm praying this review will at least be seen by upper management or the owner so the required changes are made to improve the experience of paying customers.",

The veggies were shaved, and not all that good.  The sauce was good but could not make up for a lack of chicken and the horrid veggies.  My wife said the veggies in her dish were bad too.

Hands down the best way to do karaoke because they have quite the set up and food/drinks can be ordered. It's definitely a bit pricey, but hey, you're paying for the experience. The only negative about the rooms is that the songs are a bit outdated. They could use an upgrade. Secondly, i came here for lunch one Friday evening and the happy hour is definitely a good one. The sushi is filling and haven't of options for appetizers. The overall feel for the place is nice but it can be a pain to grab a table. It's all good though. Lastly, a couple buddies of mine went to the bar on the other side of the establishment. Bartenders are pretty attentive and the prices are reasonable. Could use a bit more seating.  Overall a great place to go. Just a couple things here and there.",

It took over 7 minutes for us to be even greeted by someone. We order drinks and waited another  15-20 minutes and we finally left and cancelled our order. I mean come on guys it's not that hard to pour a few drinks in a couple minutes. My friends were pissed too because we didn't have much time to begin with and even mentioned it to the waitress.   It just seemed like a complete chaotic nightmare that no one can have efficiency for something fairly simple. It also felt like no one cared. No forth effort, nothing extra, zero. Maybe I'm being a jerk but you are in the service industry and your service was terrible.  Not sorry about the one star, I should get an apology for me and friends time being wasted we can never get back. This review also took me less time than getting our drinks.",

We called multiple times and every time they said it would be $200 for the karaoke room for 2 hours. Once we got the bill, visibly upset, I requested to speak to the manager. He told us there was nothing he could do and that he has had this problem many times and all he could do was talk to the owners. By him telling me he would talk to the owners about this constant problem, i didn't really believe it would make a difference. This is completely unprofessional and bad business.

I went here with a group to celebrate a birthday and was served hot sake with flies in it, followed by a 40 minute wait for Dirty Diaper Soup, which they try to pass off as a Pork Ramen. The waitress laughed in my face when I told her I couldn't eat it. We ordered a sushi appetizer and barely got the roll by the time the checks were dropped. This wasn't my first bad experience here, but it will certainly be my last.",

Based on food solely I would rate this place 3 stars. I am docking off an additional star because the service we received from 'Emilie' was terrible. We ordered a couple of beers and it took her 10 minutes to bring them, note that it was a weekday night and it was pretty empty. We had to pretty much chase her to get our water refilled since she was nowhere to be found. We dined there for a total of 80 minutes and our server only stopped once to ask if we needed anything. On my way out of the restaurant I figured out why I couldn't find our server throughout the entire night, she was in the entrance chitchatting with the hostess...  With so many dining options around the area I won't be returning to this mediocre place.",

Each carafe came with at least 8 shots, it was me and my boss, so after the two carafes we got a little buzz. Wanted to try out the karaoke rooms but we ended up taking off to meet up with some colleagues. We were being helped by a blonde bartender who was excellent. Gave good service and small talk for some out of towners.  Alcohol. Karaoke. Food. Sounds like a pretty good night just make sure you bring some friends.",

Besides having great sushi, some of the best in town, Sundays have an all day happy hour for selected sushi rolls, all appetizers, as well as 1/2 off the entire alcohol menu. I went there last night (Wed) besides great food and service, one thing I did like was their music selection. On Sundays its mostly hip-hop that's too loud and hard to have a conservation most of the time without yelling. Well, on Wed they played classic rock at a lower level and more suitable for the crowd. As a group, we enjoyed that atmosphere much better. Recently opening for lunch and with happy hour specials daily in the early evenings, I would recommend this place any day of the week.   Davena",

They are creative and have an artistic flare.   The sushi is always presented well and tastes fresh and of great quality. They have a great happy hour daily and awesome happy hour sunday.

The price is really 240.00 for two hours cause they put a twenty percent gratuity added at the end. The drinks are typical 10.00 for a specialty drink and around 8.00 for wine. Believe the reviews on here. When you book the room it says the room will hold max of 20. You can really seat comfortably 18 people. The room was not ready when we got there at 10pm and was seated 15 min after. I had to complain to get our full 2 hours. The service does suck and you automatically have to pay the twenty percent gratuity fee. We had to to find our server several times to get drinks and she had no personality. It seemed like she didn't care cause she knew she was getting an automatic gratuity. Overall, believe the reviews. The amount your spending here it's probably better you go out and buy your own karaoke machine and you will have a better time.",

It started off with the waitress taking 2 of our drink orders and walking away even though there were 4 of us at the table.  Then tables that had arrived after us got their drinks before and of course our drink orders were wrong. Next, one of us got his food order...20 minutes later one more...10 minutes later one more etc. The manager was no where to be found so after waiting another 20 minutes to address the situation, my boyfriend had to physically go find him. He was rude and after giving only 20 percent off we got the check with no discount so another one of us had to deal with that. Needless to say after 2.5 hours of bad service and mediocre food, I won't be recommending this spot to anyone.",

The Rock Shrimp Tempura and Chicken Gyoza are absolute musts for appetizers. I have tried several different rolls but the Caterpiller and Philly are my go-tos. I love the Salmon roll with spicy crab on the lighter menu as well. And drinks? I had no idea that I enjoyed infused sake before having theres. I have tried the Cucumber, Mango, and Peach- Mango is definitely the best so far. The Peach was not my cup of sake since you couldn't really taste the peach flavor but to each their own. The service is typically average at best but it's really hit or miss depending on the server. I've had great service and there have been times where I had to ask for a water refill each time and the server never checked on us. What lacks in service, the food definitely makes up for. Their patio is awesome on a nice night as well. With it's great location, it's the perfect date night, girl's night, or just a quick bite to eat in Old Town.",

There was a large (and excessively rowdy) group of us in one of the private Karaoke rooms celebrating Nathan S's 35th birthday this  past Saturday and I gotta say, I had a damn blast. We sang Love Shack and Sweet Caroline and Careless Wisperer. I even did an inappropriate duet to \"Like A Virgin.\"  Oh, and those pear vodka champagne drink things?? I unknowingly sucked down 6 of them. Thanks to Georgie S for making sure it was Grey Goose. Anyway, sure I paid $54, but I was seriously having the best drunken blast and I felt like I hadn't touched a drop the next morning.  So, the waitress fucking hated us, but we had a g-damned blast. A BLAST. We twirled on poles, sang horrifically at the top of our lungs and probably contracted some diseases from the booths and carpets, but whatevs, it was a blast!  And P.S... I never actually used the bidet.... really... for more than a second",

I've become a Sunday HH regular here. I can't believe I didn't go here sooner in my whole time living here. The house rolls were half off, appetizers were half off, and the drinks were half off as well.  My favorites here: For the signature drink there, and I did a fair bit of sample them, was the Blue Berrymore. It was a nice drink on a nice summer day. I enjoy their house rolls. The Geisha A Go Go roll was delicious, wrapped in their \"Geisha Green\" soy paper with a jalapeno sauce. The Gaijin roll, a specialty roll here, was yummy. It was an interesting take on a chimi, topped with their chipotle sauce made it super yummy. I really enjoyed the calamari here, again paired with the chipotle sauce for dipping, and the teriyaki ribs, which were so good and tender. The fried rice is really yummy as are their other apps. The ones I mentioned are just my favorites and ones to try. The apps here are a good portion size, unlike some other places, where you can actually share with people.   It's a good place for food and the environment is really awesome! There's an awesome DJ mixing fun music, nice eye candy. It's a good place all around :)",

We went down anyways for dinner since the food reviews were pretty good.   I was expecting this place to be a restaurant but its TOTALLY more like a bar. The tables were tiny and the music was blaring. We ordered several dishes for dinner which barely fit on the table at the same time. The food was good but I was expecting a normal sit-down dinner which we didn't get.  Case in point - when everyone raves about happy hour at a place on yelp - go there for happy hour, not dinner!",

Happy Hour is 1/2 off house sushi, appetizers and drinks. The prices are similar to stingray but with a much bigger selection, not only for the sushi but for the appetizers and drinks as well. I will be back...ALL THE TIME!  Try the Astro Boy!",

There is a random rock in the middle of the bar, which I'm convinced has more to do with tripping up drunks than it does feng shui.  Drink menu highlights include Sakes and Sou-chus, loads of asian beers, and cocktails that look AWESOME (I haven't gotten drunk here, tragic!). Harajuko Lover? Yes please!  The Karaoke room is sweet, though the location of the pole is awkward and people sitting on the couches need to watch out for wildly flailing body parts as their drunk friends work it out. Maybe that's half the fun?   All in all a solid bet for a guaranteed hysterical night of karaoke, alcohol and dinosaurs in space. Or whatever other birthday theme you'd like to apply.",

Sake bombers, sushi, random drunk broads coming on to your boyfriend because you spent too much time playing with the toilet controls in the bathroom?  Seriously girls, be careful in there.  Thankfully, my boyfriend did not give in to Drunky McSluttersons advances. However, the fact that she even had the gall to attempt it is really a testament to how awesome Geisha A Go Go's happy hour is. Chick was wasted. Hard not to get drunk when everything on the damn drink menu is half off! I think we were drinking $3 beers and $1 Sakes. $1! Truly wonderful.  The \"House Maki\" is half off also, which usually means basic rolls like California and Tuna, but nothing fancy. Geisha A Go Go's \"House Maki\" includes quite a few of the fancier roll selections, including one of my faves, the rainbow roll.  The sushi is really nothing to write home about, but when you got a nice buzz going on with aforementioned $1 Sakes, you don't really notice.  To recap: Happy Hour is awesome, Sushi is Okay, Bathrooms are time consuming, Don't take slutty coworkers.",

I wish she had so I wouldn't have wasted my Scottsdale sushi sampling here.  Sushi was not particularly fresh and they use that disgusting mayonnaisy crab mix in the rainbow roll. I'm so tired of sushi places not noting on their menu that they use KRAB (aka imitation) and not crab. Perhaps I'm just an L.A. sushi snob, but I can't get into a sushi spot like this. It was extremely inauthentic and the sushi tasted very manufactured.   The only reason this spot didn't get a one star is due to the friendly staff. The bartenders were really pretty so I can see why men might frequent the spot. From reading the other reviews it seems the happy hour is the best thing going. Well sad to say we didn't make the happy hour and paid outrageous prices for pitiful sushi. Would not recommend for anyone looking to actually enjoy sushi.",

The decor in the bathroom is expensive, mimicking a Japanese ancient Castle, with large cuts on stone masonry, copper pots for sinks, and metal tubes to look like large bamboo as the faucets.   The next best thing is the large stone in the middle of the room. It is a large rock with a spotlight on it, and mimicks a Japanese rock garden.  The third best thing is the out door patio seating, with the misters going full blast as the tempurature still hovers around 100 at 11:00pm in August. There are several tables out there, and also some couches.  The 4th best thing is the Pachinko machines in the entryway, brightly lit and real, However, as the cute hostess will tell you, she has no balls (for the pachinko machines, stupid!)  The 5th best thing is their large drink menu of specialty drinks. I didn't look in there for an \"Orgasm\" or a \"SloeComfortableScrew Against the Wall\", or other ridiculous concoctions, etc.   I felt like a Tanqueray and Tonic.  No, Make it two!  The rest of what they have to offer is, well, meh!",

The server was great and we had so much fun. This year they were kind of snooty with us. We were all ordering food spending money and they come in the room and demand the money for the room rental. It was embarrassing. They had my credit card why in the world they did that was beyond me. We also got the \"big\" room this time and I was expecting more food as per advertised on the website. Nope. 2 little trays of food. I think we had 4 trays last time in the small room that's only $100 an hour. The large room isn't cheap even half off you have to book 2 hours so it's $150. I don't think I will be repeating again next year. Just not worth the hassle. Also their website has a bunch of False info about happy hour. Beware. Many of my friends were charged different prices for the same things.",

Being from LA obviously all sushi in Phoenix & Scottsdale is a little lackluster.  It was okay.  Not great, but not bad either.  Nothing really unique or adventursome on the menu but pretty good for the desert.  What I did not expect is to get ripped off by our server.  Not wanting our guests to pay for dinner I handed our server $300 and asked her to just let me know when it runs out.  Asked her for a check before leaving and tipped her another $100 only to find out later that she also slipped a check to our guests for the entire meal.  Neither of us mentioned anything to each other until some time later.  I am not surprised as the servers we interacted with were probably just moonlighting from their normal gig at the strip club.  I would not recommend this place. If you do go...use your AMEX etc. so you can reduce your chances of getting scammed.  You can get better food at the Roku at the W.  When remembering to write this review today I was actually surprised to see this place was still in business.  There is no way this place would make it in any major market or city and I am sure they are on borrowed time.",

The infused sake was good and wallet friendly however it was very weak, not like regular sake, I feel they must have diluted it with juice and not actually used an infusion process. This is not where my disappointment comes from. The service was horrible, and our server made it seem as if we were the problem and she didn't want to be bothered by us. I only got to try one roll because the rest of my food that I ordered, on the same order card, never came. They brought out my one roll on the same plate with one roll from another persons order card, who ordered her food 30 minutes before me. She got her second roll 45 minutes later after asking the waitress about it. Another girl had to wait 30 minutes for her first drink. I have been a waitress before and even if you are extremely busy the server should never make the customer feel like they are are a burden to them. Regardless of what the reason was, the service was terrible and the restaurant should either replace these types of servers or make sure that they have enough staff to handle the volume of customer they get on Saturday nights. I would not pick this as a place to eat.",

I have an HP camera that Gwen Stefani designed for her Harajuku Lovers line so of course I took a picture of my camera next to the drink menu.  While we were there, (a guy) recommended we use the women's bathroom before we left...O..M..G!!

It was a Friday night and there weren't very many people there...not a place to 'see and be seen', but it worked for us :) I do think this place would be fabulous for dinner and a happy hour.  OH!!

Great place for a group date, if you all like to sing and drink Sake.

We ordered a half which came in a nice bamboo shoot.  It was a nice presentation. The crowd was attractive but after a while of relaxing viewing the restaurant my companions and I started to notice how all the men were talking to men and only some of the women were talking to anybody.  Kinda weird but you can get the idea.  We didn't try any of the food, but the one thing i will worn about is the Giant Rock that at some point will be the cause of some injuries. Overall i liked the decor and the vibe but dint know how often i would visit this place. best thing about it is the mixing of music and the private karaoke.",

After the usual first stop at Saddle Ranch, my friends and I would wander over to Geisha and of course hover around the rock in the middle of the floor. That was my first love of Geisha.  Now I've finally experienced their Happy Hour, which they even have on Sundays! How could you not love that? 1/2 price on all their drinks and appetizers--sign me up!!! Seriously though, the food was good. I had the veggie tempura, edamame, and gyoza (pork dumplings). I haven't developed a taste for sushi, but my friend loves it and has been going every Sunday for about 5 months now just to get it.  Plus, 1/2 price saki? Saki bombs anyone? Yes, please.",

The drink and food specials are awesome so even if it's really busy I don't get too cranky about it.  The only day that's been really tough is Friday - between 5 and 7 it's packed and sometimes the service gets a little sluggish. I don't blame the wait staff, they're all hustling, it's just that the bar is slammed. Honestly, I normally just double up on my drink order instead of running dry... it might not be the classiest method, but it works.  LOVE the Vegetable Gyoza and the Phat Daddy roll. Totally recommend their flavored sake and the Harajuku Lover.  Also, I've heard that karaoke here is a blast, but I haven't done it yet.",

One has fritos on it for god's sake...this place is all-American.   I won't go into detail on how amazing the sushi is, but it is. Lots of things to choose from and if you're not a super big sushi person, this is prob a great place to try out b/c the rolls are very mild.   My fav part of this place is their infused sake. You get an entire carafe for $8...great deal in Old Town. I've had mango, pineapple, pomegranate and apple. All were good, but mango was the best. They also have some delish cocktails that knocked me on my ass pretty quickly...highly suggest. Another perk - the waitresses are actually really nice. Skanky, yes. But extremely nice and helpful. I don't expect that from a place like this in Old Town.   Great people watching and great music plays throughout the bar/restaurant...give this place a try, you'll like!",

When we told the waitress (after she placed it on our table) she left it anyways. When we got the bill they charged us for it. After we nicely told them we did not order this roll we were told that since we ate it they were going to charge us for it. They said they would have \"reused\" the roll for a different table if we didn't eat it despite the fact that we modified the order. The manager agreed to \"compromise\" and take half off our sushi roll that we didn't order. When the waitress brought our bill back she walked away and flicked our table off. The customer service here was beyond atrocious and I would not recommend this place to anybody, especially in this area where there are so many fantastic restaurants.",

Technically, Geisha a Go Go didn't start out as a sushi restaurant but they soon joined in on the Phoenix sushi phenomenon. On a weekend night, be prepared to wait for a table and push your way through the crowd, but the best time to go is on Sunday. Why? All day happy hour. That's right. For the entire day, half the menu is half off, including tasty drinks like the hello kitty.  Ladies, this sounds strange, but check out the ladies room and report back to me on your findings.    So, geisha a go go is definitely not a no-no on Sundays, or if you're looking for a good spot pre-night on the town.",

I'm reviewing this on my drinking and entertainment experience since I didn't really order food.   I really liked the setup of this place and the indoor/outdoor layout, there was a nice size crowd on a Thursday night too. I was actually surprised that this place was a lot smaller than it looked in the pictures on their website, but I didn't feel crowded or anything so it wasn't much of an issue. I've gotta agree with Erin G. though, I'm sure that random rock in the middle is there to trip up the drunkies!  Also, I wasn't planning on doing karaoke at first, but if you're going with a good size group of friends, throw down some money to get a room. They had a huge book of song selections and it comes complete with a disco ball and pole, which means good times are to be had for all!  I'm not usually in this area, but it seems like a cool place to meet up with people and have a few drinks...it'll definitely give me an excuse to try the food if I'm ever back here.",

The ambience is actually very good on the right side, but according to the manager the music and volume level can not be mirrored to the newer, left side.

I looked online prior to going to get a good idea of what I would want (I'm very picky about my sushi being that I am from California and know quality fish) and decided I would keep it simple and order off the happy hour menu. Prior to ordering, I had the waitresses (we had two for some reason, could possibly have been a training situation, but it was never relayed to us) explain the options and ordered from their explanations. Everything I ordered was ok - they did have some great vegetable tempura, everything was fresh. When we got our bills, they separated them (which was nice) but I noticed that we were charged regular price for everything that was marked \"Happy Hour\". I tried to nicely ask a girl at the front, and she played it off and said that prices have changed and I simply replied that they should market these changes better consider people are coming for the happy hour deals. I didn't feel like holding myself up any further since we were leaving to watch the game, but I definitely will not be returning. I feel like I was cheated out of my money and the customer service was less than par. The one star is for the tempura lol - even if it was still inexpensive - this day and age, it is not that difficult to update menus and staff of current deals or to accommodate a customer if they catch you in a mess up.",

Attempting to keep the party going, I told the waitress to put the extra hour room charge, $100, on my tab.  Come to find out after the hour passed, even though I was not the original renter of the room, I was then subject to all contractual terms, which included sales tax on the room rental and an auto-grat.    I had my own bar tab, plus I ordered some food late.  The extra $100 room fee jacked up the sales tax and an auto-grat of 18% they applied to my lone bill.    In the end, I paid the $100 fee cash, and they took the charge off my bill, reducing the sales tax burden and their auto-grat accordingly.    I normally tip 20%, and my waitress was great, but I left $0 above their 18% auto-grat.    I did not like the way the bill was presented.  I voiced my concern to the manager on duty.  He didn't seem to care that I was upset, nor did he seem to want to make me feel better after my initial frustration.    The situation was resolved amicably, but I will not return.  I've lived in Scottsdale and frequented Old Town since the mid 1990's, probably about the time this manager was getting out of grade school.  The customer is always right, even when he isn't, or when he's at GAGG, apparently.      I am tempted to share this experience with my 5,000 local friends on facebook, but for now, I'll let this review stand and take my karaoke back to Ernies and 92nd Street, and for sushi, it's always been Kyoto.",

The sushi portions are great so are the quality and flavor, still they get 4 stars for their very limited sushi menu. Today I'm taking advantage of the happy hour and intend to get very happy, instead of rolls I ordered the sushi sampler and looks good and plenty full. I guess if you want more options you could go across to Stingray, but you will fin lower quality and yes higher prices. What I like here the most, after the food, is the ambiance, the place is cool and trendy the bar/terrace is the best place to start the night early before heading to a club. If you haven't been here, I know options are plentiful but you have to make this stop a most! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",

You cannot go for dinner with underage friends and have a drink...ridiculous. Second, the staff is beyond rude. I came here with a service dog and they refused to let me have her on the patio despite my paperwork. They (illegally) asked me specific questions about my disability loudly and aggressively in front of a crowded restaurant, embarrassing me beyond belief. Despite the manager being rude, I decided to take my dog home and attempt to come back without having my ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY service dog. When I came back, the waitress refused to serve me despite the fact that I am well over 21 and was stone cold sober. Again, I pushed it aside and continued with my meal. When I continued to ask to have a glass of wine, the woman at the table next to me (who was trashed) jumped in and started screaming at me for being disrespectful. I finished my meal and left and I refuse to recommend this place to anyone. Insulting and treating someone different for a disability is disgusting.",

If you're gonna take a dump here, which I assume you will if you eat the food, I highly advise HOVERING, not even a nest of TP will save you from the potential staph infection you could catch from those toilette seats.  I was trying to have a decent conversation with my company, but the 40-something year-old patrons there seem to think that yelling is the only way you can communicate at a restaurant.  If you wanna listen to dudes talk about how Poison and The Scorpions are great \"hard rock\" bands, this place is for YOU.    If someone is rating this place 5-stars, it's because they are getting payed to, or have never had sushi near a large body of salt water, and are land-locked in the misery we know as Scottsdale.  The staff were amazing, very polite and kind.  Hence the generosity on two stars.",

I have a difficult time finding sushi I really like in Arizona, but this place never disappoints!  Sushi always tastes fresh and it is delicious regardless of whether I get a basic roll or a specialty roll.  If you come during happy hour, you can fill up, get drunk, and get out of there ridiculously cheap.  For example, I went yesterday for happy hour and got a carafe of cucumber lemongrass infused sake (probably about 10 shots) for $4.25, and 2 cali rolls w/ smelt eggs (highly recommended!) for $5.75, for a total of $10 + tax and tip.",

    "text": "If you can handle usually sucky parking conditions, consider making Old Town Scottsdale's Geisha A Go Go your next go-to spot for happy hour.  I've been really impressed with the great deals the still-trendy (despite being open about 4 years) restaurant and bar offers. Not to mention, the space boasts private karaoke rooms, which makes it stand out that much more.  Every day, from 4-7 p.m., all appetizers, house maki, sake bombers, specialty drinks, seasonal wine and sake infusions are half-off. That's a TON of menu items!  Definitely check out the specialty drinks. There are so many to choose from, and they all tend to be very strong. The last time I went there, I started off with the cutely named Kinky Kooler (usually $9, at happy hour $4.50). It was sooo strong, with Bacardi Dragonberry mixed with fresh kiwi and lime juices and garnished with kiwi, my favorite fruit. It was too strong for me (I'm sort of a wimp when it comes to alcohol), but if you like kiwi, it's an obvious choice.  I tried my friend's Turning Japanese (usually $10, at happy hour $5), which I liked a lot more. It had a very refreshing taste to it, with Stoli Gala Applik, Peach Schnapps and organic apple, pear and lime juices and was garnished with pear slices. I'm sure it was still strong, but the sweetness balanced it out perfectly.  I also had the Hello Kitty (usually $10, at happy hour $5), which you just can't go wrong with. It's a pretty pink cocktail with Skyy Citrus and Japanese strawberry soda and fruit-infused sake, garnished with a strawberry. It tastes delicious, and how could you not order something with as cool a name as that?  I've also had Geisha's sushi before, which I thought was delicious. And you can enjoy all the cheap eats and drinks in a vibrant atmosphere, both for the high-energy ambiance and people who go there. It's your typical Old Town Scottsdale, pretty people crowd, and the bar is bright green with giant pictures of musical icons, connected to a cool patio. Happy hour was packed, so stake out a spot early and get to noshing.",

And every time we sit down there we say \"WHY THIS AGAIN???\". Maybe it's because it's the only sushi place in old town (except sting ray which has a terrible menu, is weirdly right next door, and owned by the same owners...).   Anyway, Geisha has a GREAT happy hour. Like i'm talking amazing. And some of the best infused sake I've ever had. And the food is pretty good too. The reason we always question why we go there is because some of the servers are just so rude and terrible. In fact, the one hostess (you know who you are...) is SO rude it actually baffles me every time. Some of my calmest friends have actually gotten into arguments with her. I will say that there are some great people who work there too. But that hostess....man she's gotta go",

First off it's not an authentic sushi spot, completely Americanized...gross(to me) I like the real sushi spots that use the raw fish just the way I like it. I had to order just a regular tuna roll and sashimi since none of their special rolls had anything that caught my eye. It only seemed like they had crab mix and tempura shrimp as an option. So disappointed.   You cannot do sake bombs the loud and obnoxious way that my boyfriend loves to do them.  You will get stopped by one of the staff members.  Not like I enjoy listening to that stuff as I eat but it's just kinda dumb that you can't if you wanted too.  Scottsdale or should I say SNottsdale....where everyone looks at you like you are crazy if you aren't completely done up. Now if this place was like a whole In the wall sushi place with the type of options I was looking for id give this place 4 possibly 5 stars.  But because their basic tuna roll couldn't even hold together for the prices we paid here I'm just not even surprised at this point. I was just so upset that not one special roll stood out to me.",

Hence why I said in my review that tables CONTINUED to free up and the restaurant CONTINUED to die down. We were there for a duration of 2 hours and there were 10+ tables empty around us all night   Had EXTREMELY poor service here. Initially I called ahead to reserve a table and the host told me they were booked for the whole night. I asked if they took walk ins and she said yes but we probably won't get a table. We debated heavily on just going to Ra because we thought we weren't going to get a table but ultimately decided to risk it because Geisha has better sushi. Literally 40% of the tables were unoccupied and tables continued to free up the longer we sat there. I had to go up to the front to ask for menus and the host says \"by chance did you guys seat yourselves?\" We did not seat ourselves, we met up with 2 friends that already had a table. They had ordered already and the server did not bring us menus after we joined. Nobody at the table had any waters for well over 20 minutes despite asking multiple times. 2 of us ended up not ordering any food because the server never came back to get our order. We only saw her when she got our drinks orders and when the drinks were dropped off but she wouldn't stay long enough for us to order. Unless there was another hidden room full of occupied tables that I wasn't able to see I am unable to wrap my head around why the service was so terrible and why the host was trying to drive us away in the first place. Oh and to top it all off our server added a gratuity to all of our checks even though we were a table of four. Guess you don't have to be a good server since you can add your own gratuity anyways!!",

He was obviously was using Axe hair products. His grandfather probably has some luscious hair back in the day. Rolling in I see large tubular cylinders with some red juice in them. Little did I know this stuff would lead me into white girl wasted bliss. The sake was served cold just like my ex-wife's heart. But all of a sudden a beautiful blonde shows up behind the the bar and damn! crooked smile, hair up, lean physique, and a sweet demeanor to wrap that all up. Ananda was sweet and charming, she kept the drinks coming even while I was trying to fight off the red head who trying to cramp my style.Matt and Ananda are beautiful and talented bartenders. They kept me \"hydrated\" and a happy while I was sad and down. They were both a breath of fresh air in dark and cloudy night. Keep doing what you are doing, love this bar restaurant. Good people, and good friends here. Oh! And the food is glorious as well. Replace the Sid Vicious with Stevie Ray Vaughn. ~E",

If you can, go at night to appreciate the neon and giant black and white photos of three passed rock legends that hang behind the bar. A 60s retro, perhaps Hawaiian, look  The ambience is festive and fun with new music and a lot of 20's to 30's-something-aged people enjoying one of many flavored sakes offered at a discount and great happy hour prices on an array of familiar Asian appetizers such as tempura shrimp, sushi, wonton and noodles.  The service was terrific on a busy Friday night. Happy hour stretches through to a nice 7 p.m. with 50% off on great food that is already priced right. A bargain. All-day Sunday happy hour. Has an appealing patio that was full on our visit with a range of ages in patrons. Note that the music was a tad loud, but bearable, for my older ears, inside.  I am giving this place 4 stars for the festive atmosphere and great prices on food.",

    "text": "\"Eat to the Beat\" is the motto at this funky Asian restaurant.  A place where Japanese Pop Culture meets Rock and Roll, private karaoke rooms can be rented out by the hour, and the toilets come with remote controls.  The menu was reinvented this year, and you will find appetizers such as Rock Shrimp Spring Rolls, incredible Teriyaki Ribs, Seared Ahi Sliders, and a plethora of Tempura selections.  In addition, the restaurant offers Yakisoba, Ramen, Teppanyaki, and Specialty Maki. Maki of Note: Foku (bacon, salmon, cream cheese, scallions, and crispy onions topped with baked spicy crab) Gaijin (spicy tuna, spicy crab, avocado, cream cheese wrapped with a flour tortilla and then deep friend and topped with a chipotle cream sauce) Harajuku Lover (shredded chicken breast, avocado, cucumber topped with spicy teriyaki sauce and pineapple sauce)  Although they have an extensive menu, I consider this strictly a watering hole, especially during their happy hour.  Happy hour is daily from 4p-7p, and all speciality drinks are 1/2 off, as well as all appetziers, sake bombers, wines, and sake infusions.  The specialty drinks are a liquid dreams.  My favorite is the \"Hello Kitty\" which is strawberry infused sake and Japanese strawberry soda, mixed with vodka.   Runner up is the \"Katori Kick,\" pineapple infused sho-chu, zen green tea liqueur, and fresh lime juice.  For a lighter cocktail, try the \"Harajuku Lover,. which is a pearl plum vodka and sparkling sake.  The karaoke rooms are small, but the large one comfortably seats nearly twenty people.  If you can get that many people together for a room, the $150 per hour cost is not so bad.  We had a fantastic time in there, and were complete clowns.  We had designated wait staff, so no one had to leave the room in order to get drinks.  (If you show up during happy hour, the karaoke rooms are half price, as well)  Busiest nights are Fridays-Sundays.  Sundays are industry night, and all sushi rolls and appetizers are half off, as well as every drink in the house.  If you want a peaceful and quiet dinner, this is not the place to come. Expect it loud and rockin.' If you are here late night, forget about finding a place to sit.  If you want an incredible experience with a toilet, luxuriate on one of their heated toilets, complete with remote control panel where you can rinse and dry your bottom, down to controling the water temperature and air pressure.  WIth so many Asian eateries in this city, this one brings a very unique pop culture experience.",

    "text": "Some friends and I went here for happy hour recently. All of the appetizers, maki and some of the drinks are half-price 5-7pm, so we each ordered a couple appetizers and sushi plates. Everyone raved about the teriyaki ribs - soft, juicy and slightly spicy - a plate of about 5 for $5 at happy hour was quite reasonable. Tamago (sweet egg) was bland, but the avocado roll (nicely priced at $1.75) was plump and fresh. Chicken lettuce wraps were just okay; my favorite lettuce wraps are at Ginger China Bistro up in Glendale, and these were passable but not something I'd order again.  A friend ordered a Turning Japanese (a specialty drink made up of orange-infused sho chu, Japanese melon soda, vodka & Asian fruit juice), and after offering everyone at the table a sip, we all agreed it was exquisite. Seriously good stuff - even though it had a lot of alcohol in it, it did not taste alcohol-y.   Kudos to the chef for redoing an entree to make it allergen-free for one of our party. Nice to have a chef and waitress who know what 'anaphylactic' means.  Cons - The music was very loud and not my style. After a while I couldn't wait to go outside for some quiet, and to get out from under the penetrating stares of the three tragically dead rockers on the wall. As other reviewers have questioned, what are they doing here? Looming over the bar, are they there to serve as a cautionary tale? As a heads-up on the music played there, i.e., that few tunes are from female-fronted bands? Shrug.  The tables are low and funky (in terms of shape) and the seat cushions do not provide much in the way of back support. They do have regular chairs, but the 'floor' option was easier for a group. However, there's no one there scolding you for bad posture, and quite a few floor dwellers were slouching happily.   This place was designed for people far more limber and hipper than me, such as the waitresses - fabulously gorgeous and sewn into tight black dresses crafted purposely to show off miles of tanned, toned legs. I watched people's eyes follow the waitresses around the room. Indeed, they were quite the distraction.  All in all, I'd come back for happy hour - but sit in regular chairs and leave before my ears reached sensory overload.",

Music is good and the decor/set up is fun. Service was pleasant so no complaints there. The sush is a bit pricey but that's OK considering the location. What we didn't really favor was the undercooked rice in our sushi rolls. Granted, this is probably not the case on the regular and was probably a one time thing but even then, I felt that the sushi rice wasn't quite as sweet and sticky as I like...maybe not enough rice vinegar? Who knows? Overall, we had a good dining experience and enjoyed our evening but we'll probably keep trying other sushi spots just for fun.",

I can't believe I paid $15 for a roll that was mostly rice and imitation crab.  Sushi rolls should emphasize the fish.   This place did not live up to all the hype with their fancy names for their rolls.  Their rolls are good for people who don't normally eat sushi and are afraid to eat the real stuff... Fisher Price Sushi - my first sushi roll.  Yes, I am a sushi snob.   2 stars for the cool atmosphere with good music.

The identity crisis between sports bar and sushi bar was a little distracting to me - we sat outside where TVs were playing some sporting event, but inside seemed more like Feng Shui-ed. The restrooms were highly entertaining with remote controlled toilets and sensor activated zen inspiring pebble sinks; if I wasn't so hungry I probably would have spent more time in there playing with the gadgets.   We unfortunately had just missed happy hour, but I could see how the slashed prices may be somewhat redeeming. The menu had some pretty decent veg options. However, the tofu lettuce wraps had a sour funk that smelled like feet. They didn't taste much better either so I'd steer clear of those if I were ever to stumble on the occasion where I had no choice but to dine here. I'll admit the veggie roll was actually tasty, not enough to make me a loyal patron though.  I've had better food. I've had better atmosphere. I've spent less money on mediocre sushi. I left feeling satiated, but after trying to wash those lettuce wraps down with sake, I still had to brush the sour feet out of my mouth when I got home.",

I specifically told the waitress I had a gluten-allergy and asked if there was anything here I could eat besides the edamme (which I said if not that is fine i'll just eat the edamme.) The waitress  checked with the chef and came back saying I could get this chicken rice dish and they could do it in gluten-free soy sauce (she also brought out the extra gluten-free soy sauce in the bottle to show me that is what they were using.) So I trusted them in the fact it was the same sauce I use at home...but oh no. About 10 minutes after I ate I felt so sick. Someone must of used the wrong sauce or put the wrong sauce in the bottle by accident cause I was sick the whole entire night. So besides getting very sick..(from whatever mix up...or lie..no one will ever know...) they do have good drinks at happy hour!",

Dirty martini up with olives is not hard.  Vodka tonic always comes with a lime.  Twice we actually went to the bar ourselves to get the garnish.  Totally lame.

But, it also has one big selling point: private karaoke rooms.   Some friends rented a \"big\" room for ten people. It is totally a small place that would comfortably seat six and is furnished with green-ish shag carpeting and a bottle of Grey Goose behind Plexiglas that has been assaulted more than once. Classy.   But, you will not care b/c the private karaoke is so much fun...less public humiliation than regular karaoke, lots more silliness and singing along. I definitely look forward to getting another group together and coming back...   Also, the bathrooms are worth a mention. They have seat warmers and some pretty interesting fixtures.",

    "text": "Horrible. If I could give ZERO stars I would.  This place is totally overrated. I went there to celebrate my 30th birthday this past weekend and was utterly disappointed. The head hostess was rude and didn't seat my party until an hour after my reservation time, which then cut into my karaoke room reservation time. They charged me for the full 2 hours even though we were barely in there for 45 mins, which was their fault. Furthermore, I booked a small private karaoke room, which under normal circumstances (meaning, a REAL karaoke sized room) would have accommodated my guests. The person I made the reservation with failed to mention that a small room will only fit 6 people MAX. It's more of a closet than a room. Most of my guests had to stand in the hallway because there wasn't enough room for them to sit down. It was horribly embarrassing. The seats were ripped up and the karaoke machine was totally outdated. They had a huge book of songs that was also totally outdated. They are also supposed to include a small sushi platter with the room which they didn't, I had to actually go find a server and ask for my sushi platter to go. Then the sushi was not rolled correctly and fell apart when I picked it up.  I am VERY angry about my experience here. I feel ripped off and they ruined my birthday. I would have had a better experience making my own sushi and doing karaoke on the Wii or going to a karaoke bar in Phoenix where me and my guests could actually have room to breathe. Avoid this place. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY.  Very disappointing considering I frequent Sting Ray across the street and love it there. I expected the same quality since it is owned by the same people, but it's NOT at all.",

Music- There is a dj spinning music onthe weekends and no question the best DJ in Scottsdale , playing music mash ups people actually can dance to not just a bunch of hip hop or house music. Every now and then late night the middle area turns into quite the drunk dance floor which makes for fun dancing or really fun people watching.  Eats- We usually load up in sashimi, which the chef came out to talk to us how it was nice to see people eating real japanese not just balls of cream cheese and rice. Everything has always been super fresh. I swear I cannot lie with out the ahi tuna sliders. We always bring a large group who always leave very happy. Its a great place to start the night at!!  Service- The girls are super cute but every know and then it takes a bit too long to get a drink but when you order a comlicated martini , you cant really complain!! I love the \"picachoo\" yum yum.  Overall the best scottsdale stop . A million times more fun and delish then Ra or stingray!",

Funny names and descriptions to match really creative and innovative combinations of flavors. It's not your average sushi place where you see the same ol' types of rolls (although you can order them I'm sure). I think we shared 4 different rolls between the two of us and I wish I had a bigger stomach. You can find so many unique flavors on the menu so no dish we had tasted the same. Shoot it's been a month and whenever I get on the subject of sushi I still talk about this place!  Lots of places to sit, which is good because it's a popular spot. I wish there were more outdoor options because the weather is typically nice. The one thing I didn't enjoy was the noise level. It was really loud inside and difficult to have a conversation.",

It took about 5 minutes just for someone to stop by and grab us waters and then finally 20 MINUTES LATER our server finally greeted the table. (Let me just mention by the way that this was a Tuesday at 6:00 and the restaurant was fairly slow). We placed our drink and food order at the same time (because we had so much time to figure out what we wanted). The drinks that we ordered then took ANOTHER 15 minutes to get to us! At this point it's 6:55 and the whole reason we came was for happy hour which ends at 7:00. I walked over to the server and asked if we could put in one more drink before it was over and she agreed to it. At this point we have been here for 40 minutes and finally got our drinks. On top of all of this when our food came out we were missing 3 items that the server rang in and the kitchen never sent out!! I'm gonna end this by saying our server was a very sweet girl but when it finally came to order she just asked if we were ready before even introducing herself! The restaurant, waitresses, kitchen, bar and management need to get their sh*t together!",

The table of three ordered 3 yellow tail rolls a California roll and tuna roll. After we expressed our disappointment on our wait, a woman who I am assuming is a manager came out at 6:30 and informed us our wait was put in at 5:50 (we placed our order at 5:30) so we hadn't been waiting as long as we claimed. She did notify us they were short staffed however the restaurant was fairly empty, I counted 6 tables as we walked out (dead on Valentine's Day, maybe that should have been our first clue not to go there). An hour wait for simple rolls seems like a ridiculous wait. We had to repeatedly remind our server of things we requested. She did not check on our table often and if we happened to flag down another server they would say \"uh ya I'll get your server\". My water was never refilled in the 2 hours we sat there. I had thought about putting in another order of sushi considering how long the wait was but then decided it really wasn't worth the wait. The sushi is as good as you would expect a place that turns into a bar/nightclubs I have only really been here before for drinks. Not to mention the happy hour menu is pretty weak, only maki rolls, apps and select drinks. Not sure I will be making a return here for sushi/happy hour.",

Cons: -Very poor lighting, could hardly see my food -slow service and our waitress did not communicate very well. Not sure if she was completely fluent in English. -took 20min to get a beer -music was loud and bass driven, an atmosphere you would go and get drunk at not somewhere you would sit down and eat sushi.  -had a unisex bathroom with one toilet  really?

    "text": "This review is specifically for my experience doing karaoke at geisha.   I have copy and pasted an email I sent to the restaurant and never received a reply to.  I went to geisha on 8/17. Sent the email on 8/18.   Last night (8/17)I went to geisha with my friends for my birthday. We had reserved a karaoke room from 5-7.  The room was reserved under my name, Dylan (it's notable that I am a woman who has an unconventional name).  I walked in around 455 and spoke with the hostess to check in - she asked for what name the reservation is under and I said \"Dylan\".  She told \"ok well we need to wait for them to get here because there's a waiver that needs to be signed.\" I had never been there before and assumed that she meant that my whole party needed to be there before we could go in the room. One of the people in my party was running late so we were standing in the entrance waiting for about 12 minutes. A waitress came and asked if we had been helped and I told her that we had a karaoke room and we were waiting but I wasn't quite sure why we had to wait.  She got the hostess and she told her that we were ready for our room. The hostess said \" no they are waiting for Dylan to get here\"  I then informed her that I am Dylan. She then took me to sign the waiver. At that time I asked her if we would be getting the 15 minutes added onto our time in the room because she wouldn't let us in. She said \"No I said we needed Dylan to be here and you didn't say anything to me. So that's on you\"   I was pretty unhappy with this response and her lack of communication. I think it was very much a product of her making assumptions about what a person named \"Dylan\" should look like. She never asked me what my name was. She fully assumed I could not be a Dylan. And when she said we have to wait for them to get here - that did not provide me with any information about what exactly we were waiting for.   Once she took us into the room, she didn't show us how to control the volume and we had to spend another ~8 minutes unable to do the karaoke because none of the background tracks were audible and we could only barley hear the mic.   The food was great. And our waitress was very friendly. She kept trying to get the a/c to work in the karaoke room because we were super hot and she said it was 85 degrees on the thermostat.   I would come back for the food but the initial experience with the hostess was very unpleasant  and I would not recommend the karaoke rooms to others due to the temperature of the room as well as the cramped space and rushed feeling. And the amount of time it takes to look through the binders to find the songs.",

More info on it is below which is straight from their website:  \"FREE PRIVATE KARAOKE MONDAY thru THURS all day Friday -Sunday from 5:00 to 7:00pm!! Just spend a low minimum in food and beverages.  No rental fee.  Regular Room -Seats 6.  $50 min food & beverage spend per hour Large Room - Seats 20.  $100 min food & beverage spend per hour\"  We enjoyed our experience and staff rountinely checked on us. The restaurant is decorately very nicely but not the private karaoke rooms. Also, their karaoke system isn't entirely electronic. To check if they have a song you want you have to flip through a large binder. They had roughly half of what I really wanted to sing. I was also sad they didn't have soju so I just had sake.",

Even though it was HH, I wanted to try an option on their lighter fare menu since I'm not a huge fan of rice. I order the salmon, which was a spicy crab mix with avocado wrapped in salmon and it was delicious! For the price, I thought it'd be more than four pieces but still super good. I think next time I'll try something on the HH menu, but if you're looking to eat something healthier without rice, this is a perfect option! The service wasn't great but they were really busy and since the location is in the heart of old town, I wasn't really expecting the best service. Overall it was a good experience and I will definitely return!",

    "text": "So....I don't know why but this place brings the dance scene from Pulp Fiction to mind. Super funky, super cool fusion of rock'n'roll and Asian vibe with a good dose of cool funky to kick it up a notch. (Love the green \"quilted\" bar stools & copper bar top) Huge patio with fully open and flowing concept right in to the interior. Perfect for our good time of year here, probably not so much for our season of surface of the sun.   Ok, the food.... I had yellow tail sashimi. It was very good. My only complaint was the center of the fish was too cold. You could still pick up on some icy particulate in the center of a few pieces.  However, I suppose way better too cold than too warm.   My next common order is always by happenstance a test of customer service level. One of my favorites is a spicy salmon hand roll with no rice, advocation, cucumber, & crab stick. At many sushi places I get attitude when ordering this.  My waitress/bartender didn't even blink an eye and handled it like a pro even while letting me know that they didn't carry crabstick. It arrived correct (another major test for sushi places) and was quite good.   Overall I was definitely happy with the food I ordered and the cool vibe. The staff was friendly and more than competent. Kinda relaxed and chill for my lunch at 3:30 in the afternoon but one can tell this place is packed, loud, and hoping in the evenings, particularly in our winter months.",

    "text": "I've come here for years and always thought everyone was very friendly. However, my most recent experience left me questioning their business practices.   I came here with many friends to celebrate a birthday and ordered a 500mL bottle of the premium cold sake on the menu (~40$), but what arrived was NOT a bottle of sake but rather a pitcher filled with sake, similar to a water pitcher... I asked my sweet waitress \"what's this\" and she said that Geisha doesn't actually sell 500mL of the premium cold sake. Instead they pour 500mL (assuming the pitcher is 500mL) worth of the smaller bottles into the large pitcher.   I find this to be unacceptable. Firstly, they advertise something on the menu which they don't sell. Secondly, they don't pour the bottles into the pitcher in front of you. How do you even know that you're receiving what you purchased? Thirdly, it wasn't mentioned prior to receiving the pitcher of sake that this is their practice. If it was brought to my attention at the time of ordering, I would have happily ordered something else.",

The place has a fun vibe: they play a variety of rock music and it seems like a fun place for college-aged people to go out for food and sake bombs.  Know that while the servers are very kind, you will have to be diligent in asking for what you need (e.g. water glasses, refills).  Even though our larger sized party provided sushi orders on separate forms with our names, it all came out in a jumble and we had to divide them up ourselves. They did kindly split our checks for us though!  Overall, the dinner was fine and the happy hour prices are fairly reasonable.",

    "text": "Well my time here was well spent. I stopped in for Happy Hour as I was craving some sushi. I ordered the Chicken Gyoza and I enjoyed it very much! I then opted for the Spicy Tuna and California rolls. I judge sushi by the quality of the ingredients and how tight the rolls are made. Better sushi chefs make tighter rolls; that's a fact.  I did not opt to drink as I was out by myself, so alcohol really is not an option (too much to lose). I sat on the outdoor patio with the brilliant green chairs. It was very comfortable and the misters took the edge off of the Arizona late evening heat.  There was a T.V. out there to watch the NBA finals and the crew promptly opted to put it on for me. The service here was great! They checked back on me often. They made it a point to see that both my tea and water were constantly refilled.  The inside is very hip and the visual sushi bar sits far to the west side of the establishment. The music and vibe here is enticing and the draw of Scottsdale locals is a show within itself. It amazes me the things I see these women wear. I saw one gal with heels so tall that she could hardly walk; not to smart if you are drinking but good to look at and a story for your friends.  It is located in a great spot not far from a wide array of many other venues depending on what you have in store for the night. It is crazy but my entire bill came out to $16.50 including my drink. Great Happy Hour pricing! Check this place out for sure! They open up around 4pm daily.  #geishaagogo #Irishcatv2 #vino2 #vino2ultimate #vinosquared #scottsdale",

I knew it had some kind of weird hot seat toilets and karaoke rooms.  I decided to check out the toilets with some of my friends after work.  The comfortably smallish lounge is located across from Stingray Sushi.  I called ahead to see what kind of crowd was expected.  She was extremely friendly and said I should definitely come down and check it out.  Oh-and there was to be a photo shoot taking place.  Hmmm.  When we arrived, Jamie -the hostess took us on a full tour of the place.  A thumping rhythm was blaring through the air.  A blend of styles made up the ambiance in the bar.  Giant sepia toned prints of  Hendrix, Morrison and Sid Vicious took up most of the entire wall behind the bar filled with very pretty Scottsdale ladies in their 20's and 30's.  there were some slight Japanese accents but overall pretty normal and DARK.  First off, Jamie showed us the Karaoke rooms each ranging in size and cost per hour. They were all complete with their own large flat screen monitor, microphones and songbook .  Prices began at $60 on up.  Looked pretty fun and I especially like the idea of not having to suffer through someone else's pain full rendition of \"Not Ready To Be Nice\", when I can clearly do that on my own and in private no less.  I liked it, but I had to see the robot toilet!  Jamie laughed when I asked and took us all immediately to the john where she, without hesitation, went right up to the commode and pointed out the various features on the wall next to the TP.  It was rather uncomfortable for me looking at a public toilet and hearing this very pretty woman talk about how you can make the seat warm up so your behind would not be shocked with coldness when in need to drop the kids off at the pool.  I am even uncomfortable now, just writing about it.  The porcelain throne did some other bizarre things- but I had left the room as quickly as possible back into the bar looking for a drink. Jamie set us up at a table along the perimeter.  Samples of Stevie Nicks, Pat Benatar, Yes, Billy Squire and even Neil Diamond rolled out over the pulsing beats.  Very strange but I liked it.  Within minutes of being seated my 2 friends (straight) and I  (not straight) noted the higher numbers of well dressed men that seemed to cluster amongst themselves without any inclusion of a female.  Hmmmm, we were very close to BS West the local gay bar.  Oh well, I wasn't complaining and my friends are cool.  Our server, also attractive was very nice and got my friends a \"pitcher\" of floral saki to split.  I had a $9 glass of Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc.  I liked my wine very much they got used to their 25% proof saki at $36 a pitcher which was shaped like a large bamboo shoot with a spout.   Then the photo shoot commenced.  Two ladies made up to look like Asian Geisha's were placed in suggestive positions, sometimes with young pretty boys that were totally into it (NOT).  Over all it was pretty cool if....IF...1.  You like really loud music that never plays a complete song.  2.  You want to do Karaoke and stay in a closet doing it.  and finally, 3.  You want to pretend your straight.  They serve food, too.",

    "text": "This place is great. The decore is awesome, looks like a cool tiki island themed bar from back in the 70's. They have special infused saki's with flavors that change from time to time. I recommend the cucumber lemon grass flavor. It's a nice, light flavor that cleanses your pallet while you eat their most delicious sushi! We had a sampler plate that included salmon, ahi, albacore and octopus sashimi. They were all fantastic, very fresh and just melt in your mouth. Also if you have never tried a \"Quayle Egg Shooter\" this is the place to be adventourous. Do not confuse with the regular quayle egg order as our waitress did at first. These must be ordered from the sushi chefs and they come in a shot glass with saki, raw quayle egg, a hint of soy and these tiny little red fish eggs that settle to the bottom. They are very similar to what an oyster shooter would be but the flavor and texture of the quayle egg shooters have so many levels to it! I would recommend you go during happy hour as most of the items are 50% off.",

At $150 an hour, I was cringing a little at the outset. However, after a number of surprisingly inexpensive vodka cranberries ($5 each.... and this is Scottsdale!), I found myself fondling my boyfriend's boss as he sat on my lap while watching my normally prim liquored-up friends work the conveniently provided stripper pole like pros. Plenty of Journey, AC/DC, and Black Sabbath provided the perfect backdrop for the shenangians. We made sure to keep the door open even though the staff kept trying to tell us to close it, and even those too-cool-for-you Scottsdale fuckers walking by the bar were stopping and checking out the mayhem. Fabulous. It's almost a week later and people are still talking about it. This will be an annual birthday tradition -- mark my words. Worth every last penny.",

Since I was getting a mixed group of friends together, I thought what could be a better way for everyone to get to know each other then over sushi and Saki bombing?!? Geisha nailed it! The ambiance was fun and hip, the food was FAB and the drinks were flowing. We didn't do the private karaoke room (with stripper pole!!!) this time, but don't you worry, we will definitely keep it in mind for the next fiesta!!!  Great place for dinner, drinks, and tons of fun!!",

When I had heard of Geisha it was for the cocktails, music and people I had very little about their food however it was delicious and we will definitely go back to try other foods on the menu.  Our group had a couple different items they offered on the tasting menu however particularly the spicy pork dumplings and the sea bass were very YUMMY!  The sea bass came out piping hot which made it that much more tasty.  Also something to note, which is a HUGE compliment to Geisha ...they cleared the plates!!  Novel concept for some restaurants in Scottsdale.  Our server and the service staff made sure when we were done with a course to clear our plates quickly so we could chat and enjoy more cocktails- love that!  All the girls had the fried banana and green tea sundae...beautiful table presence, eh on the ice cream.  The fried bananas were AMAZING but the ice cream didn't taste like it had green tea flavor.  I would have been happy with a small scoop of more premium green tea ice cream rather than a big scoop of the blue bunny.  Fortunately the friend bananas were delicious so I would order it again just for those. If they had not been included in restaurant week I don't think we would have ever thought to eat there, overall it was very good .  The service was good, the food was hot and tasty, the atmosphere was fun and ladies don't forget to check out the restrooms ;)  and let folks know don't come in after you if you're gone for 20 min!",

We all kept tasting it to try and figure out what medicine it resembled... My friend did order a pear martini that was quite good.  The sushi was good. Dragon Ball sushi was really nice. My friend got the octopus dish and loved it. Dragon rolls are my favorite and I've definitely had better at multiple places in the valley, but I got a big variety and was pretty satisfied with all of them. My friend was displeased with her choice \"Phat Daddy\" because there was some unidentifiable skin (of I think crab per the waitress) throughout her rolls.  I didn't feel like the variation in there specialty rolls were very varied. I tried 6 of them and they were all good but flavor wise not a huge difference. But some of their more daring options I didn't take a gamble on.   The service wasn't bad but for a table of 7 there should probably be more than one soy sauce bottle.   Price wise it was a little stiff but no more than what I would expect from a sushi place in Old Town Scottsdale.",

I have heard a lot about karaoke being the new trend but not until I actually experienced it for myself did I understand why, until now. We had a private room with a flat screen TV and drinks at the flip of a switch (um, can you say bachelorette party?!).  It was so nice to have a night out without actually having to wait for drinks at a crowded bar or being able to hang out with your friends without random guys interrupting with a cheesy line to try to talk to you. It was $75 for an hour in a private room with 10 of my best friends. And by the time you split that between everyone it was well worth the extra expense.   Seriously once you try it you will be hooked too! I can't wait to go back!",

The drinks and the food were ok and since it was happy hour the price weren't bad but everything was just ok, nothing special.

We were the first of our group to show up and they said that we couldn't hold a larger table (which I understand) so we found a 2 person table and wanted to get some food & drinks while we waited . . . We were then told that we couldn't start a tab at one table and then move to a larger one when our friends got there because it would mix up between servers (meaning we couldn't order food) . . .  So now I had to get drinks from the bar and bring them back to the table.  While I was at the bar ordering, a manager came over and told my wife she couldn't sit there without getting food . . . I can only imagine this guy must have been managing a gas station before this because you would think someone with any restaurant experience would just have us close out one tab and then start another when our friends arrived.  I even attempted to speak to the manager to find some way to make it work and was stonewalled by a lack of any form of customer service.",

I foresee some drunken frat boy trying to climb on top and really hurting himself.  The room is small and dark with a nice bar area and dining booths surrounding the back of the room.  There is an open window by the bar that lets in some natural light which is nice.  On to the food & drinks.  I ordered the Hello Kitty, which tasted like a strawberry daiquiri.  Between the three of us, we ordered the hot rock ahi tuna, chopped salad with wasabi peas, grilled lobster spring rolls, dumplings, tempura rock shrimp, and teriyaki pork ribs.    The hot rock ahi tuna was okay, but I had better at Taneko.  I really could not taste any of the lobster in the spring rolls at all, so hard to really rate it.  The teriyaki pork ribs were very nice and tender, falling right off the bone.  The sticky rice they advertised is not sticky rice.  It's just rice.  All of the other dishes were good, not great.  I had a real problem with the portion sizes.  I have had tapas and been to Sea Saw a few times so I am used to the small dishe/sharing concept.  But their portions were inconsistent.  On some dishes, there was enough to share among 3 people (but just barely).  On other dishes, there was only enough for 2.  I guess you will have to double up on everything, but then be prepared for a really large bill!  The karaoke rooms are really small.  You could maybe fit four-five people comfortably.  Any more and I'd imagine you're basically sitting and singing right on top of each other.    All in all, an okay night.  Our bill came out to about $35/person (before tax + tip).  I felt a little let down, because I love Stingray Sushi and Drift.  So, this was a disappointing 3 stars.  I think I will be back, but only for drinks.",

Half our staff was at the culinary festival today and their a little, you know, drunk.\"  I'm paraphrasing a little bit but this was the rationale given to our group of 6 for why it took over an hour for our noodles. Our server gave this answer to our pleas for our food with a straight face - apparently at this restaurant it's ok for staffers to be late, drunk, and provide bad service if there is a beer garden and/or Absolut tent within 10 blocks.  We were excited about checking this place out but on our way in we found some of the less-than--stellar reviews on this site. Uh oh. We went anyways and I can now happily say that we won't be going back.  If you like paying way too much money for inconsistently portioned food then this is your joint. If you don't want to have a conversation when you eat then this is your joint. If you want to be somewhere with a lame-o doorman and an actual rope line then this is your place.  PROS: The toilets are cool. Karaoke rooms are cool.  CONS: $13 for 6 quarter-sized meat medallions that you cook on a hot rock. No apologies from server for looong wait for food... but wait! They were getting blitzed at Culinary festival so all is forgiven... THE MUSIC WAS VERY VERY VERY LOUD. Ordered sake bombers and were given sake glasses that were too big for beer glass they came with - made for an interesting and wet first round. Doormen and rope lines are freakin' ridiculous.  Get over yourselves. Going to have video games? How 'bout not placing them in a 4-foot wide entryway.  Drinks were reasonably priced and creative and the music, although very loud, was good so I give one star. Unfortunately there are too many other places within a 5-minute walk that also have great music and great drinks in a less pretentious atmosphere with real serving sizes. And with a serving/cook staffs that can do their job.  P.S. We all went to college. When you put Ramen noodles on the menu we all know you can cook them up within 10 minutes. Why would it take 90-minutes at Geisha? Dunno...",

    "text": "It has more of a college bar feel than Hip Tokyo sushi bistro.   I could see where it could be fun possibly as a club sort of venue with friends on a very crowded Friday night.   But, it's marketed as a hip sushi bistro and didn't really deliver. The night was light with customers, only a few tables, yet, they struggled to keep glasses full and service the table. Food was OK. The bento box teppan was disappointing, small, and over priced. The sushi rolls were OK but, you wouldn't be surprised to get them in a mall. The drinks were good.   Unfortunately, we ended up having to go for 'second dinner' at another restaurant after wards to end up with a decent meal for the night.   Oddly I think the place is owned by the same folks that own Stingray, yet Stingray is delicious and is such a major step up over Geisha it's hard to believe it's from the same parents.   I almost never rate restaurants this low, but, it just was a bad experience for what it claims to be. If it was marketed as a bar to get drunk, get sick, and jostle with friends, OK... two stars.. but, it's nothing like anything you'd see in Tokyo.",

With 10 people in there, we turned into a sweaty airless mess very quickly. Secondly, their song choices are not good. They're behind about 2 years. Had we known, we would not have gone there. The food was mediocre; I've had better sushi. A room rental comes with a complimentary sushi platter, which was one roll (no idea what it was, even though i ate a piece); some edamame; two ribs. I ate the edamame; they weren't cooked through because they were hard and had that slightly spicy raw taste.   We went on a Friday and it was packed to the gills with Scottsdale d-bags. At least the servers were very sweet, even though they messed up drink orders once and the bill once.",

They have a really good happy hour, $1 Saki...can't beat that lol and they have happy hour on Sunday! The Saki infused drinks are tasty as well. The vegi wraps are pretty good too. Try the Karaoke there for groups!  They have heated toilet seats in the bathroom which is a plus! Be aware of the giant green rock in the middle of the restaurant if you've had too many saki...I don't know why it's there but can be hazardous haha.",

    "text": "After almost literally walking all around Scottsdale trying to find a place for dinner, we finally settled on this place. The Yelp reviews are not quite as plentiful as they are in the SF Bay Area so it took some time for us to make our decision as we looked up places to eat. Usually we look for 3 1/2 stars plus on 100 or more reviews unless it's somewhere new, but in Scottsdale we had to base our choices on about half the number of reviews.  We were drawn in by the pachinko machines in the lobby and were convinced to stay by the Richard Avedon prints behind the bar. The restaurant has kind of a cave like atmosphere so it's definitely a unique experience especially considering that there are karaoke boxes in the back.  We ordered a few of their rolls and appetizers which were half off on their happy hour special. The rolls were really tasty and the appetizers were good but had they been regular price it probably wouldn't be worth it.  Definitely a cool place but more so for the ambiance than the food.  It was a Sunday so we were sold on the half off maki. We really liked the decor. There were pachinko machines in the front with a few big Richard Avedon posters on the wall behind the bar. The interior was kind of like a cave We ordered a couple",

    "text": "Greg Donnally, Brian Chittenden and Andrew Nam, the team behind Drift and Stingray Sushi, have another restaurant opening on Friday, Feb 22.  Donnally calls it an \"Asian Bistro Lounge\" and takes his inspiration from the lounges and clubs he saw on a recent trip to Japan.  He says that it is the kind of place where Japanese men go after work to unwind, and to have drinks.  When you enter, you are confronted with brightly lit modern versions of the Pachinko machine.  Pachinko is a cross between the pinball and video slot machines.  They have \"private\" karaoke rooms which i suspect will be well fueled by the post work drinks.  The menu will have a lot of shareable plates and, of course, sushi.  They also boast a variety of infused sake and shochu.  I'm looking forward to the opening.... Pass me a sake, anyone wanna karaoke?",

The other place  - Stingray Sushi - is awesome. I expected Stingray style service and manners, but was really dissapointed.  The biggest problem was that the \"doormen\" were rude to a bunch of guys I was with. They said they couldn't come in because of \"dress code.\" They said \"no flip flops.\" This was ridiculous because:  A: They let me in. I was wearing flip flops.  B. They have a wide open window that showed at least a dozen other guys inside wearing flip flops too. No dress code for the dudes inside, but there is a dress code for the guys I was with?  C. A bunch of guys and girls came in wearing flip flops after us  The guys I was with are all well dressed guys who were dressed down after a spring training game. After a little hassle over the flip flops they let us in. We asked the bartender about the dress code and she replied \"what dress code.\" So I asked a manager about the dress code and he didn't seem to know what I was talking about.   It seems like the bounchers decided just because my friends prefer to wear Lacoste, Puma and Hugo Boss over wearing ED Hardy and those stupid-ass AFFLICATION t-shirt s.   I guess we are not cool enough for this bar. Which is fine with me.   Cool concept. Too much dickwadness in the way of having a good time.  I will give it another try on another night and see if it was a fluke. Stay tuned...  Boo!  * Edited to add more information",

WTF do Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, or Sid Vicious have anything to do with Japanese food?  These portraits on the wall are just one of many examples of how this place does not get anything. This place is treated as a club by the bouncers outside, but it's really just a sub-par restaurant in the disguise of a high-end Japanese restaurant. So, Geisha A Go Go are you a club? Bar? Japanese place? All of them?  I was here for a friend's birthday a little while back and I found that the food overall is not worth what you pay for. Of course they go with a \"minimalist\" gimmick and give you insultingly small portions. The service is alright, but again, nothing special.  I don't think even hara-kiri would bring any honor to this place's horrible sushi. I guess the usual Scottsdale, Diesel jean-wearing date rapist wouldn't know the difference between good sushi and mediocre with all the blow dripping down his throat, so I guess this usually goes unnoticed.  Now, if you talk to a fan of Geisha A Go Go you might hear them mention, \"But, they've got really cool bathrooms.\" Well, I don't go to a restaurant to dump out the meal I just ate.

There was little pieces of lint floating all inside - and the shot glass fits only like a tablespoon!  At the bottom, there was a little brown streak that I wiped out (I was not going to ask for another dusty shot glass).  BTW, the sake tasted like water and green apple mixer with a touch of sake - it is the weakest drink I've ever had!  The carafe which is normally 10 dollars, 5 at happy hour poured 5 little teaspoonfuls of sake.  How do you mess up wasabi and soy sauce??  The rolls we ordered came out fine but somehow the soy sauce had like no flavor.  Do they water the soy sauce down??!?!  I normally put a lot of wasabi, but this is the first time I put the whole pile in and barely got a tingle in my nose.    Oh, and I had to wipe down my little place too because there seemed to be old food on it (it felt gritty and there was a piece of dried up lettuce on it).  The table probably was never wiped down because it was sticky as well.  This place SUCKS, and I would never go there again.",

My friend had the Turning Japanese (which I tried as a shot the first time I went and either it was made really sweet, or it tastes super sweet after the Mango Sake) and she thought it was delicious - so delicious she had 3.  I had the Hello Kitty and it was delicious - so delicious I had 3.  Probably my only negative is the music was too loud. I think that it might just be me though...

Uhm, the door was unlocked, though. Just as we began to pull it open, thinking they had just opened for lunch, a man in a gray t-shirt approached.   \"Hey, we're not open.\"  \"We read an online review that you were open for lunch.\" \"Nope. We've never been open for lunch.\" \"Oh...\" \"Come back for happy hour. We open every day at 5.\" My co-worker checked his watch. \"That's only 5 hours from now. Thanks.\"  And then he walked off. No \"thank you.\" No \"let me tell you about your other options in the area.\" Nothing. He just walked toward the back of the business. Must be the owner or manager.

    "text": "Took a friend to go and check out one of Scottsdale's newest spots, Geisha a Go Go which just opened on Saturday.  We walked in and were greeted by a Kaitlyn a Bubbly hostess...she introduced us to one of the doorman (who was off of work) and 2 bartenders Logan and Ray.  Again very nice, friendly and Talkative...The place is small.  But nicely decorated.  A large rock is in the middle of the bar area, very Feng Shui, but I wonder what knuckle head is going to try and \"climb\" it in a drunken stupor. But I couldn't understand why there were 3 very large pictures of Jimi Hendricks, Jim Morrison and Sid Vicious...great rockers, but why?  Two died of a heroine overdose and the other committed suicide.     The Karaoke rooms which they have been advertising to rent out by the hour for $50-$100 are very very small with a HUGE tv.  (remember when you were a kid and your mom told you not to sit too close to the tv or you will go blind?!  That is what will be in the back of your mind when you are in the room)  Lets talk food...I have to say, this was NOT one of my new favorites.  First off, Logan made us a \"Hello Kitty\" cocktail....very fruity, whicj i am not a fan of, but i slowly enjoyed the strawberry martini cocktail. We started with there rock shrimp and soft shell crab small plates.  These items were okay, but too much cilantro on the rock shrimp...We then ordered the grilled lobster spring rolls and tuna/blue crab tartare.  Terrible!  I did not like these items.  Why does everything include cilantro???  I hate cilantro.  I wasn't at a Mexican restaurant.  The spring roills were chewy and more veggies the lobster and the tartare, I had trouble tasting this.  I felt it to be WAY TO fishy!  That to me was scary because tuna does not have a fishy smell...well it would if it was old!!  So that scared me, oh and the seaweed salad atop the tuna was very very salty...  Geisha a Go Go also mentioned that they will be redoing the patio in front to offer outdoor dinning.  This will be completed in the middle of March.  The only reason I would go back would be for a cocktail...I would not recommend the place to dine.",

    "text": "We were recently at Geisha a Go-Go for a friends birthday for dinner and karaoke.  First we did dinner, then karaoke in the BIG room, which was a blast.  My issue was our waitress. We were there on a Tuesday night and we were some of the only people in the place, so the excuse \"it was just really busy\" doesn't apply.  A couple of us ordered Hot Rock dinners, which were supposed to come with rice. Our meals came with no rice and when we brought it up to the waitress, the following conversation ensued:  Us: Hi, I think our meal is supposed to come with rice, right? Waitress: Yeah, but usually the meat is filling enough, so I didn't bring it out. Us: Okay, but it's listed on the menu. Waitress: I know.  Um, I'm still being charged for it, right? And the Shrimp Hot Rock meal came with 3 shrimp and a tiny Asian salad.  Wow, how filling. There were other issues with her service, like bringing out the other, more expensive wine that I didn't ask for twice.  I will probably never go back to Geisha for a meal, but it is a good place for drinks at the bar with friends on the weekend. Or on a weeknight if you don't want a big crowd but fun atmosphere.  The reason for the \"Meh, I've experienced better\" rating, and why it is not at an \"Eek! Methinks not\" is because we did have a good time...when we didn't have to deal with the waitress.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I'm probably older than most of the people reviewing this place. I choose my eateries based on the food...the vibe is important, but secondary. So I'll limit my comments on the whole karaoke thing....yes, it's probably a decent place to party down, get smashed and make a fool of yourself, if you're into that sort of thing. But I'm a retired musician, so I've done more than my share of belting out a tune. I came here for the food.  So...the vibe didn't do much for me when I walked in....it's set up more like a bar than a restaurant...cramped, dark and loud. Fortunately, it was a pleasant evening, and only around 6PM (it was a dinner meeting), so I was able to miss the rush =and= grab a table outside. A table full of noisy drunk yuppie college kids and some poorly chosen music could have harshed my mellow if I'd been in a crummy mood...but I wasn't, and it didn't.  As to the food....for a sushi snob, it's not easy to find decent sushi anywhere in the Phoenix area. So I was pleasantly surprised. The fact that it was happy hour and all the appetizers were half price made it even more pleasant. Tried the spider roll, tuna roll, sashimi, and some non-sushi items too...ahi sliders, cucumber salad...all quite good. The spring rolls were a bit nondescript, but all in all, not bad. The service...well, the waitress was cute and called everyone darling, but I'd have rather she actually knew how to pay attention. (Okay, I guess I'm showing my age again, but I've fulfilled most of my waitress fantasies, and these days I just want them to bring me my food on time.)  All in all...not bad. I'd eat there again, but I'd try and make sure I could sit outside.",

    "text": "Geisha is part Scottsdale, part Los Angeles, and part Osaka. What I mean by that is they have the cheap ass patio that is so common in scottsdale bars, with the goofy oversized pictures of rockstars that you would find in an LA rockbar, and the private karaoke rooms and \"Japanese\" food.   I tried a multitude of dishes, starting with the steak and chicken skewers, both average. The tempura rock shrimp, while a familiar dish at any japanese restaurant, was exceptionally delicious. Octopus salad was fairly weak, but it was followed by a trememdous steak stir fry. But by far the best dish, was the ribs. OH SHIT DAMN! I had ribs all over the country, and these were the best I have ever had. Hold the bone, and pull the meat cleanly off with your chopstick. It was the most tender, succulent piece of meat I have ever had. I WILL go back craving those ribs some day.   The place is very dark, and very loud so it is a good place to hang out with a group of friends and dance or drink. Not the best for convo. The private karaoke rooms hold from 4-20 people and are rentable from 40-100 dollars an hour, depending on the time and day. They do have waitresses that go in the rooms if you want them to. This is how most karaoke bars are in Japan.  The best part of the place by far is the bathrooms. The toilet seats are heated, power up and down, air freshened, self flushing, and they shoot water on your butthole and then dry it off. I guess I'm sheltered because I'd never seen those before.   This is a great place to have some rambunctios fun with friends, and the food is better than average. Everything was good for the most part, but the RIBS WERE AMAZING.  \"I had ribs for lunch, thats why I'm doing this\"",

Velvet ropes, a meat-head bouncer, and a skin-bearing girl standing in the doorway. Blah.   I went with a large party and we rented out the large karaoke room. I have to say, it was pretty fun. There were two flat screen tvs on opposite walls so the person singing on the small stage could see them. There were couches lining the walls and two tables - so there was room for all of us.   There was a vast array of music to choose from. From your cliche \"I Will Survive\" to much more recent songs \"Toxic\". And  yes, I had to listen to both. However, it is somewhat entertaining to watch a drunk guy sing a Britney Spears song in Falsetto.  Anyway, that's it. I'm not much into karaoke so I probably won't be back. But I can appreciate the novelty. And, for anyone who loves karaoke on a Saturday night, well this is the place for you.",

I had never had the opportunity to go to this place but was always wanted to try it out since their seemed to a nice crowd on the patio.  Well let me tell you what I think, that is why you are reading this of course... It was packed! Like crazy packed! But there was the nicest hostess! We had a party of about 8 people coming and she said it would be a wait, but not a problem! She kept checking in with me to make sure I was ok and letting me know where we were on the wait time for the table!  Who ever was working as the hostess on the 4/18 around 5pm.  Give that chick a raise! She was awesome! No matter how busy I saw she was, she always made me feel like I was not forgotten in the shuffle. Well we sat down and my friends were drunk and starving! I mean they spent the day at the culinary festival so you know they didn't have an opportunity to eat! Our waitress was so sweet! she informed us that it was half off Sunday! All sushi and drinks were half off! I've never been so happy in all my life! I ordered two vegetarian rolls and my friends ordered the left side of the menu plus a couple rolls and drinks.  Our waitress was on top of it!  After the crazy amount of drinks and food that we ordered the bill was only $70.  If you eat at a sushi restaurant, anyone knows the bill is usually around $100.  I was so impressed!  This place is awesome and should defiantly be a stop on a Sunday Funday! Oh P.S.  Their toilets are crazy! their mechanical and warming and I don't know what is going on, but you have to check it out.",

Upon checking my account later, i realized the waitress put an extra $40 on my tab, which was frustrating, because I had to come back and speak with the manager. The manager was kind of annoyed because he had to go back in the records and find my transaction using my credit card to fix the problem. When he came back he apologized and said he would buy me a drink for my troubles. I actually had other plans so I said \"get me next time.\" So, next time I came with some friends and told the waitress the manager agreed to buy me a drink.

After studying Japanese for six years it's hard to go to a Japanese punk/rock themed sushi/ Karaoke bar with authenticated toilets without laughing at the Hello Kitty titled martini. I couldn't build the courage to try the Pokemon inspired dish.  Too afraid it would be something electric and related to rat.  Would have loved if the waitresses had a little more spunk. I felt like I was in some teeny bopper themed beach st. hangout in Laguna.  On a good note, the sushi was cheap, but for a place also owned (and this is what I've heard) by stingray sushi...the sushi promotion should have been a whole lot better. Tip, GO DURING HAPPY HOUR.  I honestly have to go back and review it again without bias.  Maybe going in blindfolded would help.     Good thing myself and Ameerah A. know our sushi, or we would have ordered dragon roll expecting dragon! I loved the sushi bar, but wish there was seating there (that's where you drown yourself in sake and sashimi after a chew out at work) the Green seats were nice as well.  the Pachinko machines were classic. One said cleverly in Japanese 'press button' so, by pressing the button you release a Japanese Oni that yells at the top of his lungs and chases you out of the restaurant.  Haven't found that button yet have you? too busy with the spraying toilets I see. ;)",

    "text": "Let's face it: Arizona is not known for its sushi. Sadly, this girl loves sushi. So A few months back a few girls and I decided to come get drinks here before a night out on the town. The drinks are inventive and delicious with adorable names. The first time around I only got drinks, but liked them and the atmosphere enough to bring friends back who were visiting from another landlocked state. This time, we ordered adorably named drinks and sushi. The sushi was fantastic! I was so impressed with the quality of the food, considering the place was packed with a gagillion people all ordering sushi at once. I have been back a few times since and would highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar. It is fun to watch the chefs, and it is out of the way enough that you don't feel bombarded by the other guests. The last time we went, we even had a great conversation with the chef about his recent trip to Japan. Very entertaining. Sunday nights are obscenely busy for one reason or another (can't remember why, but there is a reason for it) and nighttime in general brings in a rowdier \"Scottsdale scene\" crowd. But I love it. And I love so much about this place. The best sushi I have had so far in Arizona with great service to boot!",

Don't let that Asian menu fool you... the tables are awkward to sit at, the plates and portions are UNREAL small and not made for sharing oh and try not to be distracted by the Geisha Girl waitresses that look like they are straight out of a slutty Japanamation comicstrip - seriously. What's it good for? Well, go to Stingray and get some good sushi and then walk over to Geisha for drinks and karaoke in private rooms. That's about it.",

I thought it would be perfect because my friends love to karaoke (and drink) -- but the service was terrible and the microphones/karaoke machine continually stopped working.  At one point - it took the guy a half hour to \"fix\" the machine... when you consider it's $150.00 an hour - that was $75.00 we spent to just sit in a room and watch a guy attempt to get the machine to work.  Not to mention we were told that we would receive large sushi platters -- and the waitress just \"thought we didn't want them\".  After we finally got the platters - other people wanted to order food and the \"kitchen was closed\".  Would have been nice to get service/sushi right at 10:30 when we showed up.  Not to mention the $600+ bill that we had to figure out how to split ourselves (even though we were willing to pay as we go...).  The service was terrible.  This place ruined my birthday.  I wish we would have stayed at the dive bar down the street (for free) instead of paying $450.00 for all the hassle.",

    "text": "In a word: run for your effing life.  After reading the review on it in the New Times, we decided to hit this place with some friends. It was the first time for all of us, and to be fair, we are not of the \"Scottsdale\" scene and that was definitely part of the problem.  I'll make this simple: Issue #1: Made reservations for 8:30 and even though almost every table was open, we couldn't be seated for a good 15 minutes. Issue #2: Um, is this place a restaurant or a dance club? A DJ fired up at 9p and it wasn't music you could ignore. It was like eating in \"Trainspotting\". Issue #3: Gigantic, pointy rock in the middle of the \"dance floor\" Issue #4: $12 for four TINY SLIVERS of tuna that wouldn't make an anorexic full. Issue #5: Over an hour to get our meals, which were served one at a time, apparently whenever they were ready. Issue #6: Did I mention there was a DJ? Issue #7: The crowd was of the Paris Hilton type, which I was expecting, considering. However, my friend summed it up perfectly, when she said, \"This is the kind of place where you can see a 40 year old puking in the bathroom around 10pm.\" Well done, my friend. Issue #8: The service: horrendous. Our server actually admitted to us that the kitchen crew was hammered because they'd been at the Scottsdale Culinary Fest all day. I'm sure they remembered to wash their hands, though.   Other than that, it was fine.",

This was a light meal for us so it was chicken gyoza dumplings (savory), chicken Ceasar salad for me (a simple and excellent light dressing), salmon sushi (very fresh fish), pork Katsu for the Mrs (hearty) and a tuna roll that was very strong. Incredibly good black ice tea. The service - we sat at the sushi bar and the chef was super attentive to us. We had a waitress that was very friendly and attentive when she was there. The problem was that there didn't seem to be a manager and so she covered indoor and outdoor on both ends. A bit more planning of stations would have had the shorted the lag and skirted the issue. Good music - a bit confused decor but overall very good experience.",

We tried a similar place in Vegas and it was amazing, so when we found out that there was a place in Scottsdale that had private karaoke rooms, we were all in! HUGE disappointment! First of all, There are only two private rooms. One small, one large. And they weren't worth the $$$. They also charge you for a full hour. So we were there for 1.5 hours, but were charged for 2. It cost us double what we spent in Vegas for half the time. Then room itself was dark and plain. The karaoke system sucked. It kept telling us certain songs that were in the catalogue weren't available. The song selection was weak. And the lyrics kept fading out so you couldn't see them. The food was awful. Chicken tempura with no flavor. Seared ahi sliders that tasted like rubber. Drinks were poor. Service was horrible (waited 22 minutes for a soda!)...then the waitress kept walking in and interrupting songs. Then when we got our bill, an automatic 20% gratuity had been added! And the gratuity included the charge for the room fee! There's no way I would have given a $35 tip, but we had no choice. It was just bad. Will NOT be returning!!!",

I used to be a server and I know how the computer works. The server manually added chicken to my dish to increase the price of my bowl. Lol. Sad? Absolutely. For a couple extra dollars to add to my tab, seriously? Little does she know that I would have tipped her well since I was in the industry. I asked her about the price change that differed from the receipt. She lied straight to my face. Lucky for her, she added gratuity to my tab because I would have tipped her zero. I don't think I've ever tipped absolutely nothing before in my life, but this is absolutely unacceptable. I wish I would have remembered her name. Completely fraudulent and disgusting.",

If I had to rate this spot on sushi alone, they'd probably get a 3, and although the fries tasted fishy, we kept eating them. Fries at a sushi bar, you ask? Yes, yes indeed. The menu was a bit overwhelming  - sometimes it's better to have fewer options rather than more - although I thought the Geisha Lips, Astroboy and Dragonball rolls were standouts. The drink menu is predictably strong and fruity, with kudos to the infused sakes, lots of bubbles options (although only one by the glass), and the Kotori Kick.  Would I go back to Geisha? Well, she was my karaoke first, so she'll always hold a special place in my heart. So, yes.  P.S. Do not miss a stop in the bathroom. Seriously.",

You can sit outside on the patio and when the weather's nice, it's lovely.  Happy Hour is a great deal with a large beer for about three bucks and half-price appetizers and maki.  If you stick to the maki - spicy tuna roll, etc. -  you won't be disappointed.  If you order anything else, you probably will be disappointed.   Pro: Good location Nice outdoor patio Great happy hour  Stick to cheap beer and maki  Con: Everything other than the maki is pretty lame Classic rock 24/7",

    "text": "A friend reserved a large karaoke room for her birthday here. I like how the rooms were cleaned and there was ample amount of seating available. The pole in the room was a nice added touch, too. It has been a while since I've gone out for karaoke with friends so I was excited to sing my heart out and down shots of soju.  They had a large selection of songs to choose from and we had a hard time deciding since our time was limited and there was quite a few of us. We had a blast singing and dancing along while sippin' on some flavored sake. I usually enjoy soju (or sochu) at karaoke joints which they didn't have, but flavored sake is just as good and sure hit the spot. We had several carafes of the Mango, Cucumber and Pomegranate. Mango was my favorite since I'm a sucker for Mango but the Cucumber was refreshing and the Pomegranate wasn't bad either.   I thought the rooms were outrageously pricy,though. $150 an hour for a large room. But given that there aren't really any private room karaoke spots available out here I can see how they can charge such price and have people actually pay it. I think there are two others private room karaoke places but one caters to a chinese clientele with very limited english songs and the other is a brand new one in chandler that I have not explored yet so i don't know too much details on it. So for now, I guess it's pretty much the only private room karaoke spot I know of here. I hope more spots open up around here cause I had a blast and would love to do it again but I wouldn't wanna pay $150 an hour for a room. I know there is a half price happy hour rate, but I rarely can make it there that early.",

The manager told her they could not do it. How do you take reservations for your karaoke rooms? Over the phone credit cards... Basically a lazy manager who did not want to help make a night more special for my friend. I have worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years, and that is not hospitality. So though I live in LA the next time I visit Phoenix, this will not be a place I will be stopping by. Great job!",

Half price drinks, appetizers & house maki (get the chicken gyoza - you're welcome in advance). I've ordered different rolls here and favorites are the freshwater eel roll, cali roll and dragon roll.   Kudos for *consistently* fresh sushi served at a good temperature - but it could be rolled a little bit tighter, sometimes they seem to fall apart easily. Actually, every roll here falls apart, it's predictable.   I've spent less than $20 with another person on 2 different rolls, saki bombers and an appetizer.  Servers are always sweet and seem to have fun here, I dig the vibe. I always feel like they work together to help each other out so we get our food & refills faster - I hope they tip their bussers well.   And...definitely check out the bathrooms, like a trip to Japan.",

It was after 9pm and we looked for somewhere to eat and instead of bar food we decided to come here.  We were seated right away. We ordered sake right away and the waitress gave us 2 glasses for beer. Not the way you are suppose to serve sake. Anyways, I also decided to get beer and I told her we'll just keep the glasses and to bring some sake cups which she did. Minus 1/2 star.  We ordered from the sushi menu since we were both waiting to dinner together. Chicken wings were not crunchy and lacked flavor. Minus 1/2 star. Yellowtail was okay but not great. We also ordered a couple of interesting rolls Gaijin (some kind of chimichanga roll) and I don't remember the other but it wasn't memorable at all. The waitress totally forgot about bringing the gaijin roll and I had to remind her. Then another waitress came over and asked me a couple minutes later which roll they forgot. OMG. Minus 1 star.  The waitress didn't have an idea of what she was doing and lacked any kind of knowledge of the food. My gf asked what kind of sashimi they had and she didn't have a clue and she started guessing some names. Minus 1 star.  Would I come here again? NO WAY will I eat sushi in AZ ever again!!!",

Not unless I'm there for my favorite sport: people-watching. However, my fabulous friend Natalie had recently won a free hour of a karaoke in one of Geisha's private rooms. Free karaoke? Don't mind if I do!  It's no secret, I love karaoke. In fact, I am slightly obsessed and a place like this really gives me the opportunity to sing my heart out without having to share the mic (much). Just like any other karaoke joint, you get two books full of song choices, two microphones, and your own server. There's even a little switch to flip in case you need your server to come check on you. Unfortunately, our server was like a freaking model or something. AND she was really nice. Couldn't they give us someone a little uglier to make me feel better about myself???   Anyway, we had a great time here. We gave Celine Dion, Spice Girls, and Bonnie Tyler a run for their money. However, that being said, I don't think I would be willing to actually pay the $75 per hour fee to rent one of the rooms. The rooms are super outdated and a little gross. Yes, that is probably True to traditional Japanese karaoke, but the price is just too steep.   Thanks for another free night of fun, Natalie!

I have yet to find another HH anywhere in AZ with specials like they offer, as well as the quality of food and drinks on their HH.  The infused sake bottles are DANGEROUS and when I say that, it is because they are ridiculously cheap and tasty. Their specialty drinks are also delicious, especially the Pikachu. (I have yet to try every specialty drink but I am sure it will happen eventually)  And if you're addicted to edamame as I am, you can't beat a decent sized serving for $2 during happy hour. Not to mention the Go Go Fried Rice has always been amazing! (and the amount of food for $5 is ridiculous, in a good way) My favorite sushi will always be their Dragon Rolls which have always left me satisfied.  I've read previous reviews about the poor service and I have never experienced that myself here. (but again, I have only gone for HH and have always been able to seat myself at the bar)  If you only have a party of 2, perhaps sit at the bar or patio. Sure, it's hot in AZ but with their misters on and a nice cold beverage, it's not half bad.  The music has always been top notch as well. I am a fan and will continue to spread the word on the great Geisha a Go Go!",

When you first walk in through the giant green door, it's like you are entering the walk-in closet of a Japanese slot machine hoarder. You have the option of sitting inside or on the patio, or renting one of their three karaoke rooms. We almost always sit on the patio since the inside is so dark that I'm afraid I might wind up in the wrong bathroom. The karaoke rooms are nice, although intimidating as you are being led down a dark hallway to a room in which your companions will most certainly make fun of you. Depending on your group size, 5 could fit comfortably in the smaller room whereas 8 is pushing the limits (imagine spilled drinks and dropped sushi). They larger room is intended for 10 - 15 and is pretty spacious. The sound system takes a bit to get used to, especially figuring out if it's plugged in correctly or trying to input numbers for the song selections. Once you get the hang of it, its smooth sailing and the only bumps are trying to decide which song to sing next.   The Happy Hour here is fantastic - half priced karaoke rooms, maki, appetizers, sake, and house specialty drinks from 4 - 7pm every day. We can get away with a ton of food for very little money - it's great. I think we've tried almost everything in the appetizer section - our favorite being the teriyaki ribs. Then, we normally order the dragon roll. Their sushi is good, standard for the most part, but the specialty rolls have some pretty cracked out names. One of our favorites is the Gaijin - a chimichanga styled sushi roll, deep fried and delicious with cream cheese and avocado. We haven't ventured much into the other areas of their menu - salads, noodles, etc. The green tea gelato is good, but we've had better that tasted less freeze burnt. (If you want ice cream after this meal, definitely walk around the corner to Lee's Ice Cream Liquor - alcohol infused ice cream to die for!)   I would definitely recommend this for happy hour or a birthday with friends.",

I had Turning Japanese...I lost count after my first couple of those. The Happy Hour food is also a really good deal and tastes amazing! This doesn't taste like Happy Hour sushi, it's just good sushi.   The only issue I had was the service. The hostess who sat us didn't know if it was Happy Hour or not, and deflected a lot of initial questions to the waitress. Don't plan on asking your hostess too many questions, apparently they can only process whether or not you want to sit inside or outside.  Our waitress sucked. I mean, she didn't smile, didn't check up on is, didn't ask if we wanted dessert, didn't refill our water. Whattahfail.  But whatever, as long as she brought me my drinks promptly, I was happy.  The atmosphere was really fun and laid back, so this is definitely a place I see myself going in the future.",

With all honesty, I only go here for happy hour, but you can't pass it up!   $5 sake bombs = YESSSSS!  veggie gyoza= YUM! chicken gyoza = UHHH YUM!  and the rolls! oh the almighty rolls, they are all made to perfection ! They are really delicious.  All the apps are half price during happy hour, and there are so many choices!! it's excellent! and BONUS they have a DJ there sometimes that plays some groovy tunes.   In addition to the great prices, the location is killer too! Old town is really a great place to go out so if you're feeling rowdy enough to start drinking during happy hour, you can hit the bars a little bit later and make a night of it.  WIN WIN LADIES AND GENTS!",

    "text": "Last Saturday two of my girlfriends and I went in for dinner for one my my friends birthday. It was a pleasant place, the food was good and decently priced. It was loud, but that was the type of atmosphere this place was going for, which is something I'm not going to complain about. The only unfortunate part of the evening was our server. Our sever was ignoring us consistently through out the night, and we sat for a decent amount of time waiting for her to come over to take our orders. But, it was busy, so none of us were too bothered by the situation, so we shrugged it off and understood.  The thing that really got us is that we all split the check, two of us paying with credit and one with cash. When another server returned with our checks, the server who had been taking care of us pocketed the rest of the cash in my friends check book. My friend was planning on leaving that amount anyway, but the fact that the server assumed she was being tipped that amount (which was approx. 27% for her portion of the bill), was rude and the last straw for tipping our server a larger amount. So, myself and the other friend of mine left a small amount of money on both of our bills, leaving the server with a 10% tip, and pretty annoyed customers.  I definitely would have gone again if I had not had to be taken care of by that server again, but unfortunately, the server has left a really disgusting taste in my mouth. Checking my bank statements this morning and doing some budgeting, I found that the server had over charged me, giving herself a 20% tip on my credit card receipt.  I myself have worked in the food industry for nearly 6 years, and I have seen servers come and go for \"stealing\" from customers, and a few get arrested for it as well. I do not wish that on this girl, but I do want it brought to the management's attention. This is absolutely inappropriate, especially when you are working to create a name for yourself in Scottsdale food industry. I hope you can look into this a bit more, and find out which one of your servers is doing this.",

Most of her time was spent in the service well talking to some stereotypical \"bros\". The shrimp tempura roll was labeled $5.75 but we were charged $8.50. I wanted to bring this to the attention of our waitress but I couldn't chew and swallow fast enough to say something before she'd drop and run. The tempura roll was bland and made sloppily. However, the sushi rice was made perfectly, it was sticky and just a little sweet. Both the fried rice and yakisoba noodles were drenched in sesame oil and were only enjoyable after a liberal application of Sriracha. For $64, bad service, and just okay food I won't return and do not recommend this place.",

We constantly struggle to get seated and serviced. Today specifically, we wanted to sit inside by there was nothing available so we asked if we could start outside and move inside once a table was cleared because it's so hot out, and they've done this for us before, and for some reason this time they would not cooperate with us. It wasnt even that busy. Even when we agreed to stay outside we still had to wait another while for someone to come help us or even get us a menu. It's sad how poor the service has gotten. We even stopped sitting at the bar because the newer young female bartender would always ignore us and would always have a sour look on her face. It always takes so long for someone to serve us, they serve everyone around us and just completely ignore us. More than once, we've had to go up to the hostess to ask to see if anyone was going to help us. And we waited while everyone around us were being helped. And they don't even apologize for making us wait so long. Been going here for years but it's time to find a new spot.",

Service was just right for the experience I was seeking. The sushi chefs were also friendly and they made some delicious rolls!  I tried the Rock Shrimp Tempura (happy hour pricing, of course!) and I recommend trying this! I wish all of my favorite local sushi places had it because it's a perfect shared app. I also got just a plain ole Philly roll (with soy paper, because that's how I roll .... no pun intended), and a Bye Bye Kitty that was pretty good.

I'd never made so much for a cold sake bomb, or for Sushi that taste like I made it myself!  Nothing exceptional about it all.  This is only my 3rd time trying sushi since moving to Phoenix.  Here, Blue Water Grill and Whole Foods!  Whole Foods beats everybody else out of the water.  In addition to the mediocre sushi, the service absolutely sucks!  We probably only seen our server a total of 4 times.  Once when she took out drink orders, once when she brought the drinks back and took our order, and the third time she came when she noticed we were done and already had the bill in hand.  I careless to give this place a second try!",

    "text": "On Sunday night, a bachelorette party that I was apart of had made reservations to come to Geisha A Go Go. Sushi and Karaoke sounded like so much fun! We had made this reservation a month in advance and had been told that it was a minimum of $200 to reserve a room but that would go towards any food and drinks that we would order. We had a large group--that would not be problem. From the very start of the evening, there was never any clear direction of how the evening would go or how we were supposed to order or the time frame of anything. There were long periods of time where we wouldn't see our waitress. We didn't know if we were supposed to go outside of our private room to order or if we were supposed to wait, it was all very confusing. We were finally able to order some preliminary drinks and appetizers and when they arrived at the table, the drinks were piled up in the middle of the table and we had to guess which was which. In addition, the food delivery was so staggered, part of the party was almost finished eating before the others even received anything at all. And the bills were slapped down in the middle of the table before all of us had even been served our food, a clear indication that we should feel rushed. When we finally received all of our food and were ready to close out our bills, we were shocked to find that not only did we have things on the bill that we had not ordered, but, instead of putting our $200 deposit towards our meals, we were charged a separate $200 on top of that. One of our girls, very calmly, I might add, went to go speak to the manager just to clear it up or to get a better understanding of what had happened. She returned and said he was unbudging and would not even discuss the discrepancy or the fact that whoever we had spoken to about the reservation had clearly given us faulty information.   We tried another attempt to speak to Scott the manager of Geisha. He became belligerent and hostile and pointed and wagged his finger in my friend's face and said \"I WILL get my $200!\" A point to keep in mind, we had no intention of NOT paying the bill. This was never a question, however, having worked in retail and having friends that have worked in the hospitality business, keeping a customer happy, even if it's a compromise, is usually more important. He said the only way we could work it out is if he took the gratuity off so that his servers wouldn't get a tip. Although the service was subpar, this problem was not our waitress' fault. I have never heard of a boss that would throw his employees under the bus like that. At this point, we are exiting the room and going to sign for the bill at the front of the restaurant, Scott was completely indignant and continued to be aggressively rude. Although there were multiple witnesses that saw Scott raising his voice and pointing at our friend, he begins to back track when we were signing the bill, and says that not only was he NOT yelling, it was our friend that was yelling at HIM. My friend literally had no voice from being sick, there was no way this was even possible and he tells her she has no voice because she had been yelling at him. Let's just say for argument's sake, they just had horrible customer service and they couldn't do anything for us, that is one thing, but to have a manager of an establishment be that blatantly aggressive and unapologetic about the situation was completely uncalled for. The most unprofessional experience I have ever had in a restaurant.  I would also like to point out, that when I arrived at the restaurant, I took a trip to the ladies' room, where upon entering, a few girls crammed into a stall to do lines. I guess that should have been a good indicator of what kind of establishment we were dealing with--or if nothing else, at least the management that night. Scott was a terrible representation of this restaurant's branding.",

Had a birthday party with all my friends in their Tokyo tonic room, and they were unwilling to put on karaoke. But the thing was, it wasn't about their unwillingness, but the extremely rude behavior to the groups there that were paying several hundred dollars for drinks and food. I was very disappointed in the service overall and will not be coming back here with my friends until I hear that things have improved. I really wish that they'd change their habits at the management level. Clearly something is very off.  If you're simply looking to have lunch here, it's good. If you're trying to have a birthday party or anything larger than normal, I do not recommend.",

    "text": "We reserved the large $200 karaoke room and at reservation a $100 nonrefundable fee is required.  They didn't let us check into the room until 5 minutes prior.  We brought our own birthday cake, $20 dessert fee.  If you bring confetti, it's a $50 fee. We were told there would be an 18% automatic gratuity on the room.  When we got our bill, the $200 room rental was present once again on the ticket (even though we already paid $100 at reservation) plus our drinks.  The 18% gratuity was taken from the total amount and THEN the $100 was deducted that was paid weeks prior.  So realistically, the room is $250.  The server was able to walk away with a tip  larger than our order itself.  The room was pretty much what we expected so no issues with the room itself, it's just all the unknown fees and extra digs they make for an extra buck.  Since there are so many small details that should be noted, we would have really appreciated maybe an email at the point of the reservation to be made more aware of the extra fees and rules.  They sort of just threw it at us at check in requiring signatures, when our minds aren't really able to fully focus on those things, instead, we were focused on our party attendees and greeting them.  Just disappointed with how they appear to sneakily take more money.  We tried discussing this issue  with the manager about the billing, left a message, and never got a call back.",

I ALWAYS get the hello kitty martini. The name just speaks for itself. It comes with Pinnacle citrus, Japanese strawberry soda, and fruit infused Sake. Yummy!!! For food, I always get the Gaijin roll. It's like a chimicanga type sushi roll. I know, it sounds weird but it's actually quite tasty. I don't usually do hand rolls, and I've never gotten a philly hand roll before but omg, I loved it!   The only negative thing about this place is it can be a bit pricey during regular hours. However, they do have happy hour everyday from 3-7 and half off ALL drinks on Sundays. The service is also really good. We were always checked on and they're also very knowledgeable about everything.   I need to come back during happy hour and Sundays! =)",

Change the attitude. -the hostess thinks she she owns the place. We came here once to celebrate my friends new job and put our names on the list. An hour goes by and no notification.

The service is hit or miss. If you can get a seat at the bar, that's about the only time I actually have received good service. I've been there countless times with a party of two where there are plenty of tables open only to be told the only place they can seat 2 is at the cramped sushi bar that servers are constantly walking by with food, but not actually checking on you. The plus side to that is the sushi comes out almost immediately, but you'll be waiting and waiting on the appetizers and drinks. Maybe if you're dining with a large group you'll be seen as a more valuable customer and will receive better service, this is just what I've consistently experienced in almost 3 years of going here.   Overall a great spot, if the service was better it would easily be 5 stars for me - they have rent out karaoke rooms, an upbeat Rock N Roll theme, and a great menu of food and specialty drinks. Happy Hour is 1/2 price apps, maki rolls and drinks, which is unbeatable. Just don't come here for the top notch service because you won't find it.",

There was some confusion about the rental fee versus minimum spend and we almost left, but they were nice enough to have been willing to waive the cancellation fee due to the miscommunication. We ended up staying and having a great time.  I had a gin & tonic at the bar and a Hello Kitty in the private karaoke room. The Hello Kitty drink was absolutely delicious and perfect for someone like me who loves sweet drinks. Happy hour sushi was cheap but delicious. When doing tequila shots, salt and limes were available upon request.  While they had a good selection of songs, the selection wasn't the most current (where was \"Hotline Bling\"?) and sometimes random: no \"Don't Stop Believing\" by Journey? And only two Taylor Swift songs (and from her first album!)??  The staff were competent and accommodating and I was impressed by how well our server handled us despite all the karaoke commotion. I wish it was easier to pay in large groups. Individual tickets would have been nice.  Overall, a good place to go for drinks and karaoke. Just do your research about the private karaoke room policies beforehand.",

    "text": "So things may have gotten off to a rocky start (losing our reservation for 13 and having to eat outside), but thanks to friendly service and yummy rolls, I found myself in a very forgiving mood.   Is this place super authentic for you sushi snobs? Definitely no. But it's a fun atmosphere and there are plenty of options for vegetarians, and even non-sushi eaters (everyone loved the chicken teriyaki sliders). The most memorable item of the night for me was a roll featuring crushed fritos. Sounds gross, I know, but with the katsu sauce on it it tasted more like panko breading than corn chips.   Most importantly, the cocktails are amazing - I could not get enough of my kiwi cocktail (I think it was called the kinky cooler - ignore the name and just try it!)  After dinner, we piled into one of the private karaoke rooms and thanks to our helpful waitress and many sake bombs, we had a wonderful night. They were lacking some randomly important karaoke songs, but we managed to have a good time regardless. I have to say I thought we'd get more use out of the pole in the middle of the room though!  Two very important notes, one good, one not so good:  First, you MUST go to the bathroom. Anyone who's ever been curious about those fancy Japanese toilets will have a blast in the ladies' room (can't speak for the boys' room). I'm surprised they put them in because I bet on busy nights a long line must form as people are testing out all the fun, weird functions on the toilet.   Second, a note to whoever writes the descriptions for the rolls on the menu: You may not have too many Asians in your life, but next time you're thinking of a way to describe your sushi, saying things like 'you no likey?' and 'herro!' are not appropriate and may be offensive to some!",

    "text": "Sign me up for a return visit based on the eye candy alone. Every server here was a total smoke show! The amount of times I fell in love was the equivalent to the number of sake bombs I consumed (4) making my evening both easy on the eyes and buzzworthy.   Even though I showed up late to meet my coworkers and the food was not exactly fresh, it was certainly apparent that for Scottsdale sushi this is a hot spot. Several of the rolls I tried were unique with innovative flavor combinations.   For dessert we headed into the private karaoke rooms where I ordered a large humiliation sundae. My only caution is to be prepared for the most random song selection you've ever seen. With very minimal hip hop or 80's tunes and a heavy dose of Celine Dion, just be prepared to double my intake of bombs in order to be comfortable singing here.",

    "text": "Wake me up, before you Geisha A Go Go...  This place conjures up images of super cool Geisha chicks wearing modified robes (ie super short) with white boots dancing to \"These Boots Are Made For Walking.\" I just love the fun vibe here, which is carried through to both the cocktail and sushi menus.   It's not just about vibe, though. The food is Wham Bam Good!  The veggie gyoza is possibly amongst the best I've ever had and I've had a lot in my time. I'm talking about whole edamame in the dumplings! Wrappers are slightly crisp, perfectly pan fried.   I also recommend the tasty veg soba noodles. A very simple dish, but one that I all but inhaled, because it's perfectly prepared.  The veggie sushi roll was slightly disappointing. As it's the only vegetarian sushi option that I found on the menu, I ordered it hoping for more than the usual carrot, cuc and...? (no avocado to be found and I think it should always be featured in a veggie roll to keep it from being too dry). The whole shebang is just really tasteless. The avo/cuc roll I ordered never arrived, but I know our large table ordered up so much that it's not really a big deal. If I had really wanted it, I would have asked for it. I do think that because Geisha is a post modern take on a sushi joint that they could stand to get creative with the vegetarian sushi rolls.  Now, let's turn to the fun karaoke rooms! Never did the private room thang before and although the machines kind of confused us (as did the song choices, quite honestly), the super sweet and lovely waitresses/hostesses never left us hanging and tried to be of assistance whenever they could.  Next time I'm back, I'll be singing my rendition of Wake Me Up Before You Go Go (what? I love that song!) in homage to all the geishas out there...wave your hands like you just don't care...oh, the possibilities are endless when you have a cocktail in one hand and mic in the other.",

Walking in I was shocked to see how small the room was. There was a small bench and 10 of us had to squeeze to even fit. It was not very comfortable - especially for the people sitting in the corner. It was also very hot in the room so that did not help matters.  I was also surprised the room was not decorated better. Just 4 blank walls - boring.  We had the room reserved from 7 to 9. I know for a fact we arrived after 7 because I hate to be late. As we were getting settled in the waitress told us which drinks and sushi were on happy hour. Great, we thought - let's all order half price drinks. So we ordered accordingly - happily getting drinks and sushi on the \"happy hour\" list. Well when the bill came everything was full price! When I asked the waitress she said \"when I told you about it, it was still happy hour but when you ordered it wasn't happy hour anymore.\" Wow, seriously? That's shady. I didn't want to make a scene since it was my friend's birthday but that really bugged me. I looked on their site later to find happy hour ends at 7 so she should have never told us that in the first place. Or at least told us when we finally did place our order. Bad waitress!  The room comes with free apps and sushi which is cool considering the price of the room. The food was all good but nothing amazing. There are other sushi places in town I would go to before going back here. The drinks were pretty mediocre as well. The names are better than the beverages themselves.  Needless to say I do not think I will be returning anytime soon.",

The short blonde hair waitress greeted one person out of six at our table, asked for their drink order and walked away. If that wasn't strange enough once we ordered she didn't return. We never had the opportunity to order another drink or even a water refill. Then the food started coming out with one person's order ten min before everyone else's delivered by a different person who also didn't want to refill our drink order. Now min later we still had two out of six meals not delivered we all started sharing and finally got our waitresses attention and explained that we were still waiting for the other meals and we no longer interested in receiving them. She decided to go grab the two meals that we asked to go ahead and cancel and attempted to deliver them. We again explained we no longer want them have all shared our food so no one had to wait any longer and she replied with \"that's how it is\". Things don't all come out at the same time. We asked for a manager who never came over she removed one of the items and decided to deliver our check. Once the check was correct she stated she will be charging gratuity and changed our receipts still never able to speak to a manager. The staff was clearly uninterested in assisting us throughout the entire visit and continued to serve more and more alcohol to this large group of about 15 people who were so loud we couldn't hear ourselves. This place was horrible. Only compliment to give is the great artwork and decent food once it was delivered.",

    "text": "Absolutely recommend coming here and renting a private room, especially during happy hour, as the room reservation is half off! They have several sizes of rooms to choose from, so even if you're a small party, it may work to your advantage!  We've rented out the 20 person Karaoke room 2x. It includes a stripper pole, for those of you willing to try and comes with a large sushi platter for the room! Our waitress, this past time, was AMAZING and was willing to work with us. Everyone got a separate check AND they were able to split the cost of the room between everyone, so not one person was footing the bill and had to collect cash from everyone!  The only downside to renting the room is I feel like Geisha is never fully prepared for the largest room. Each time I've gone, we've had less than 20 people and they cannot keep up with our orders. I don't mind as much, except that some people weren't getting there food until we only had 20 minutes left in the room. (for us slow eaters, that's not enough time). So, if you have any late-comers in your party, it really kinda sucks for them!",

Every one is nice even the security gaurds. Sometimes gets Really Noisy due to there dj but its Whatever tho. Great for groups and to bring your friends who haven't had sushi before.",

Different infused sake's and lots of different cocktails.  Def a recommend.",

    "text": "I had a ball on my first visit to Geisha! My friend reserved a private karaoke room complete with a stripper pole! As soon as the drinks and food started flowing everyone  was up singing and dancing all around the rooms. Great service, food and drinks!  Most recently I made a visit to on a Saturday night with my girls and we had a great time, the DJ was playing good music and it was very lively which made for great atmosphere for a \"girls night out\". We started with a round of drinks of course, I ordered the Harajuku Lover which was made with pear vodka and sparkling sake, it was the perfect drink to get the night started. We also ordered an array of appetizers my favs were the edamame and the seasoned fried calamari rings. We got our drinks and appetizers pretty quick but we all ordered specialty maki rolls for our dinner and some of us had to wait up to 45 min. after the first person at the table got their food. I get that that everything is made to order but if we put our orders in at the same time  45 min. is a long time to wait. At one point everyone had their rolls except for me and I had to ask the server was my order put in. If we hadn't been drinking and talking and enjoying ourselves I would have definitely complained.I'm still giving them 4 stars because out of all the times that I come to Geisha this was the only night that there was a slight glitch in the service. I'll be back soon most likely for their awesome happy hour!",

    "text": "They have those fancy Japanese LED automatic screen high tech doo-dad toilets! This place is a must try for those alone! Yes, I want my toliet to have a blow dryer (no paper required unless you have dropped a deuce), seat heating, massage options, water jet adjustments (so many witty responses to be had here, but too inappropriate), automatic lid opening, and automatic flushing, which can all be accessed by a control panel on the wall!  I've always visited Geisha on the weekend before heading out to Old Town and really love coming here on Sunday nights (1/2 price drinks and apps!). They have a DJ every weekend night playing great tunes while you eat yummy sushi and stare at dead rock stars behind the bar. Yep, there are beautiful photos of Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and Sid Vicious along with a rock (literally) themed wall and sculpture in the middle of the restaurant.  I really enjoy the sushi here and have never had a bad roll. My absolute favorite drink to get tipsy on is their Kinki Kooler. It consists of Dragonberry vodka, fresh kiwi, and lime juice. So delicious, before you know it you have downed three and started dancing to the music in your chair, yep, you are that person! You're welcome.  Service has always been great, friendly, attentive staff. Once it gets busy it can be hard to find the hostess, but when she does, you get helped right away. There are also private karaoke rooms that one can rent out for an event which all have patios that you can sit at and people watch at night (that is always a good time). I did notice about four TV's inside playing a football game, while there were an additional four outside playing a different game. Generally, these TV's have on music videos so it was interesting to see sports, I'm not sure how that happened, because the crowd here doesn't strike me as interested in sports.",

    "text": "Many 'a time have I visited A Go Go, for both food and drinks...sometimes both.   Drinks...over priced. Happy hour drinks are often watered down. Wine selection, so-so. The servers aren't exactly seasoned when it comes to describing the sake list.  Sad...sake is what makes sushi great!!    The waitstaff seem more consumed with their appearance than with serving guests. No water refills, and you have to ask for sweetener (several times).   I would not go out of my way to come here for food. It's great if you're in Old Town and want a generic sushi experience. You'll probably run into someone you know...or remember seeing at Smashbox but their name escapes you...The fish is not fresh and the rolls often have little differentiation in flavor.  On the plus side: Sundays are all-day happy hour. Half off house rolls, cocktails, etc.    You know the food isn't that great when people are highlighting the ladies' restroom in their reviews.  I was slightly disgusted when I discovered that female guests have access to bidets. I don't mean to be graphic but....doesn't the warm toilet seat breed bacteria?    Anyways...a decent place.  Plus, there are many great places in the vicinity to visit after stuffing your face with happy hour sushi.",

    "text": "Go Go here for happy hour! From 4-7pm you can delight in their half priced apps and specialty cocktails. Their sushi rolls are meh, but their teriyaki ribs are falling off the bone, finger lickin' good! The cocktails seem to be concocted for little Asian girls (which is odd since there are no Asian girls in Scottsdale, especially now that my BFF and I are gone) - fruity with cutesy names like \"Hello Kitty,\" \"Harajuku Lover,\" \"Shiso Horny,\" and \"Kinki Kooler\" just to name a few. My favorite was the \"Turning Japanese\" which was like biting into a vodka infused pear.  Service at the bar was wonderful - Victoria is the one of the cutest bartenders in Old Town (guys, go pay her a visit). Drinks were flowing and the food came out quickly.  In addition to the happy hour and Victoria, make sure you check out their restrooms and private karaoke rooms, complete with \"entertainment\" poles. If you end up spending a long time on their Toto toilets, people will understand why. Seat warmer and a bidet? You'll want to take your business there on a daily basis.",

    "text": "I will start off by saying that Geisha a Go Go is my go-to spot for happy hour, social gatherings, and taking out of town guests. I frequent Geisha a few times a month for their great happy hour which consists of $1 infused sake shots, $4 sake carafes, and half off apps and house maki rolls. GREAT happy hour.  Needless to say, Geisha seemed like a no-brainer to host my birthday dinner. Everyone was to meet there for sushi and drinks to kick off my big night. I called ahead to make a reservation. They don't take reservations but do accept \"call-aheads\" which basically puts your name high up on the waiting list... I told the hostess it would be a group of 10, give or take. No problem, she assured me. But once we arrived, I was immediately treated like this was a huge inconvenience. Come to find out I'd have 1-2 more joining us later on, and this seemed like it was asking way too much.  So I'm wondering why on my birthday I'm being treated like bringing 12 people's worth of business is a bad thing?! Finally we're crammed into what I deem the worst table in the house--an awkwardly shaped corner table next to the bathroom--and spend the rest of my time there being regularly approached by servers and managers to \"double check\" that no other guests would be joining me...again being made to feel that I have done something wrong and that more business is unwelcome. Our waitress did a good job of reaffirming her irritation with me and by the end, I couldn't be more ready to leave, which was by the looks of it exactly what she wanted.  In conclusion, while this is still a beloved happy hour spot, I feel a bit betrayed by my poor experience on my birthday. Since happy hour is obviously what Geisha does best, I recommend going for that and taking your bigger-party-business elsewhere.",

    "text": "Seriously, the stars are mostly for Katieoke...um... karaoke, and the heated toilet seat. The TOTO toilet also has a bidet function, but I was kind of grossed out by the idea of a public bidet. Is that odd? Wait, did I just give away the surprise in the bathroom? Sorry!  The vibe is definitely trendy, not straight up Japanese, hence the A Go Go I suppose. There's a creative drink menu, including some crafty beers, and the sushi menu is definitely not your Japanese mama's selection. There are teriyaki chicken sliders and a roll topped with fritos. Overall, I think the food gets most of its punch for being creative. I actually couldn't resist ordering a role with grilled chicken, as I wasn't feeling fish, and the overwhelming flavor was of burnt breast. That's what you get for ordering chicken at a sushi spot!  The private karaoke room is always fun, but beware of the shag carpeting. Seeing my fellow diners in the floor gave me the heebies!   All in all, more of a group fun dinner than a fancy date dinner or foodie fanatic dinner, but, who can complain about group fun?",

I work nearby and called in an order to-go, the girl taking my order couldn't seem to answer simple questions about the food so I ordered a salad and 1 roll to keep it simple. She told me it would be 15-20 minutes before it was ready, by the time I found parking it had been well over 20 minutes and the order still wasn't ready, she told me 5 more minutes her attitude was careless and rather insulting. She kept telling me \"Like 5 more minutes\" and ran my card (15 bucks for two small items) when it was close to 30 minutes later I told her to forget it and just refund my money. Then magically my roll was ready, and it turns out the salad had been sitting at the host stand the entire time, in this lovely heatwave. I had to ask her twice to refund me and then she had to go get the manager to do it which took another 10  minutes. The manager was very nice and apologetic, explaining that they were short staffed which I understand. I do not understand why I wasn't informed when I called in my order that they were basically too busy to do to go orders, and that turn around times were going to be extra long. I would have completely understood that, if the hostess had been polite and less arrogant that would have made a huge difference too. Customer service and service recovery are huge in this industry! I won't ever be coming back here and I certainly won't be recommending to my clients, there are plenty of restaurants in the Old Town that do it right and sadly this just isn't one of them.",
