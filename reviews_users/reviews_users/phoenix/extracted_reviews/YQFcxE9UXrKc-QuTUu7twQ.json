Great place to go sit outside on a nice day and have a Corona or Pacifico with some chips & salsa. They have a good happy hour and the atmosphere is fun and summery. Their food is delicious. They have the best Mahi Mahi tacos I have ever had. When I am craving fish tacos, I go directly to Loco! I have taken many friends and family here after talking it up and all agree that the fish tacos are amazing. I have also hear the Lobster tacos are great, but have never tried them so I will have to do this. Loco Patron is great for lunch, dinner, happy hour, a place to watch a game, etc. One of my faves.",

Lotsa tequila, which can be a very good or very bad thing, as we all know, but reasonable prices and a good inside/outside mix. People seem to always congregate inside near the bar or outside at the tables, never so much in what looks to be the dining area.   The bathrooms are pretty gnarls barkley, but with that much booze and Corona floating around that's bound to happen. Food is so/so, but the staff is always friendly and quick to help out.",

Went for something to eat and whatever it was that they brought (we ordered their \"famous crunchy pork tacos\") was stone cold, tasteless, and a disgrace to the country of Mexico. Couldn't even eat it. The \"salsa\" was probably, no it WAS, the worst attempt at salsa I've ever had and the only way I can describe it properly would be weak tomatoey something put in a blender and whipped into a foam with plenty of water added. No taste and another disgrace. Disinterested waitress added to the fun. A total waste of time and money and you couldn't drag me back screaming. I never thought you could screw up a taco, but this guy \"cooking\" did it. Even Chipotle can make a taco that puts this crap to shame. Go anywhere else.",

I frequented this place with both girl, guy friends and my boyfriend and never did anyone complain. Convenient location that's close to all that old town has to offer.  Crowd ranges from ASU kids to older folks but is often a nice mix. My only complaint would be that on Thursday or Friday nights there is sometimes a wait for a drink if you don't sit at the bar. Killer margaritas and a really nice patio to hang out on a warm night. I try to go back whenever I'm back on my old stomping grounds in AZ.",

One man at another table actually had to get up and go and find his waitress.  The waitstaff is cute young girls.  They stand around their ordering computer screen and bullshit.  They cuss.  They flip their hair.  They talk girly stuff.  But they seldom pay attention to their tables.  And they pay ZERO attention to the not-so-good-looking young Hispanic guy bussing and cleaning their tables for them.....he spoke to me, and I spoke to him.  They do, however, pay a lot of attention to the big muscle boys working behind the bar.  So, yeah, food is fine.  Service feels weird.  Girly.  Young.  Inexperienced.  Shallow.",

I really wanted to give 4 stars because I have had great food experiences here but I have to agree with past posts about the crowd.   The tacos are suprisingly great and the salsa is awesome!!!  It tastes like fresh tomatoes and none of that overly onion-y and garlic flavor some salsas have.  Keep it simple!  Food comes in a timely manner.  The muscular food runner guy was quick and on top of things. We had a pretty blond server and she was really attentive even though the place was packed.  $3 domestic and mexican beer all the time is a great deal while the mixed drinks are average (little weak).  So I give this bar 3.5 stars.",

Now this is incredibly gross so if you cant handle it don't read on. I went to loco patron for lunch like a year ago maybe things have changed. I ordered nothing special from the menu, all in all I would have given it like 2 and a half/ three stars. That is until a giant fucking cockroach crawled out of my food. Needless to say I am traumatized and will not go back there. To be honest I wasn't an asshole about it to the staff in fact I didn't say anything I just got the check and got the hell out of there. Now I have had bad experiences at places before, you know the old \"hair that is obviously not mine in my food\" routine. You know what eventually I am hungry enough that I can forgive that one for the right circumstances, but I will never forgive loco patron for what happened to me. Well don't tell my psychiatrist that she says forgiveness is healthy or some shit like that.",

We also had a carne asada torta which we really liked. It was beef, avocado, onions and peppers with some type of mayo on fresh torta roll. There were great beer specials and the place started filling up. with mainly college aged males, which is fine. the decor is Loco Patron style, skulls and such, we liked it.

They have good happy hour and OK margaritas but the flavor in damn near everything we tasted screamed anything authentic and was very mild and nothing banging about it. When I asked why, the ditsy waitress said because customers would say it is too spicy. It's Mexican and it's in our culture don't water it down! Go to an Authentic Restaurant like No Que NO Mexican Grill, literally right up Scottsdale Rd and they have amazing flavorful food and even more flavorful and one of a kind margaritas like Tamarindo and Mango Habanero. Oh, and ew, the chip salsa, ugh, no flavor at all. May have consisted of just two boiled tomatoes like pepper and salt.",

Last night while dining in we ordered food based on a menu that was displayed on a clip board. It clearly stated that there was reverse happy hour after 10pm. (Mind you it was 10:15 at this point). The bartender then said that menu was old and it no longer existed.   If you are going to get rid of a special or promotion your menu should reflect those changes. Otherwise it is False advertising to me.   Disappointed.",

I don't know what they do to it but it's so fresh. SO FRESH.  You can't go wrong with much of anything on their menu but my favorites are their steak tacos and protein bowl. Even their house margaritas are good, they taste nothing like the electric yellow mix crap you see in grocery stores. Overall for pricing and quality/freshness of food you get it doesn't get better  The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because service is really hit or miss. My bf and I are honestly one of the lowest maintenance tables you could have, seriously you won't see us looking at a stopwatch to see exactly how minutes went by before waters are refilled, but we've had a few experiences where our server has disappeared forever.  With that being said, food and drinks always comes out super quick even when they're busy!",

We decide to come here for the playoffs only to discover a completely different menu - one that is missing half to three quarters of their normal fare - and is about $2 more expensive per item.   Now, I understand that places want to take advantage of the business and the extra people in town. But what about having specials instead of price gauging? Even being a regular, I'm not sure I'm going to want to continue to support a business that wants to charge locals more to visit on a weekend that we happen to have a lot of visitors in town. What is next? Price gauging for the entire month of March for spring training?",

There is a certain nepotism that occurs at Loco whenever you go. If you know someone there, you can get good service. If you don't, you will wait a long time to get acknowledged at the bar or at a table. Also, their employees drink there on their time off, and they always get served before the other customers. I've actually seen an off-the-clock employee attack a customer that was leaving. The customer got kicked out while the body guards protected the employee doing the attacking.   I can excuse a bar for having bad food (most bars do), or for have expensive drinks (it is Old Town), but I cannot excuse the blatant favoritism and poor treatment they doll out to customers. I went on a many a day to Loco, but after being treated poorly many times I will never go back. There are plenty of other spots in Old Town that will deliver similar experience, without crappy service.",

This place is super cute, a lot of outdoor seating - under the ingenious water misters, so that was a plus.. I love those things, casual ambiance, walk up window to the bar from the outside is great! I only grabbed a couple drinks both times i ended up here, but the service was great, friendly and fast.   Unfortunately my first beer tasted like it was from the bottom of the keg and completely flat, but honestly i was on vacation in the sun, drinking a beer - on a week day. Can't complain too much!!

However, when we arrived we saw that the patrons were all dressed up (not very cowboy) and the prices were quite high so we decided to walk around and we found Loco Patron and decided to give it a shot.  Boy am I glad we did.  We were fortunate enough to happen upon Loco Patron on a Tuesday and as other reviewers mention, this is Taco Tuesday night. $1 beef or chicken or $2 steak or fish tacos and $2 draft Mexican beers and $3 margaritas.  We each ordered three steak tacos. The meat is great, These tacos include lettuce, pico de gallo, cheese, and a guacamole sauce that has a bit of a kick to it. I ordered mine without lettuce cause that's how I roll and the tacos were excellent. I ordered a Dos Equis and Cris ordered a frozen strawberry margarita. The beer was ice cold and delicious and the margarita was one of the best I have ever tried. It was so good I ordered a second one for us to share after I finished my beer.  Our waitress was excellent and very attentive. She took good care of us.  The atmosphere is very casual and there are a dozen Best of Phoenix awards up on the wall.  The restaurant is clean and there is a large bar area. I will definitely be back to this venue.  Dinner for two with chips and salsa and alcohol was less than $20 (on Tuesday). Outstanding.  NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:  Honestly I cannot think of anything to add to this category. It was a great dining experience.",

Entering alone, I would normally sit at the bar for my drinks and maybe a little food.  They were all taken, (and I found out quickly it was for good reason) so I positioned myself near the televisions so I could watch the game.    Menus were on each table so I glanced through them while waiting.  The third quarter of the Colts- Titans game had just started when I sat down.  I decided to leave once the Titan's had scored about four minutes of game time later(which probably means I had been sitting there for 10 minutes).  The waitresses gave me the once over when I walked in and then not a look after that.    I guess they don't need business that badly.",

Once this was settled we got chips and guac which came pretty quickly however nobody came back to the table until we were good and done with the appetizer. We finally order dinner, 20-25 mins goes by and the waitress comes by to see if we needed anything else, she didn't even realize we hadn't gotten our food and was gone so quickly we couldn't tell her. 40-45 mins has gone by and she finally comes back to see if we were ready for the check to which we laughed and said we had yet to get our food. The waitress blames the kitchen takes our order again (taco salad and 2 tacos with rice and beans) and finally 10 mins later we get our food. But wait, the tacos are not anything close to what my friend had ordered. The waitress comped our dinners but still handed us a bill for the guac and one margarita. It seems nobody in that restaurant knows what they are doing, and I sadly will never go back. Don't waste your time with the God awful service.",

He has been a big fan Wednesday wings, he knew what he wanted and ordered them as soon as we sat down...A dozen hot!  I decided to look at the menu and glad I did.  I saw they offered Salt and Pepper wings, plain ol' crispy fried wings seasoned with salt and pepper.  These rocked!!  I ordered a dozen, even my friend was impressed!  The waitress kept the fresh tomato salsa coming with the chips.  Both good and homemade.  I was impressed.  My glass of water was always full and service friendly.",

However, we still hadn't revived our drinks or appetizers. 5 minutes later we got our chips & halfway through our meal we got our drinks..

But my friends that I was with each got strawberry margaritas, which were $10 a piece. It doubled in price simply because there was strawberry puree added to them. Maybe only charge $1 extra for a flavored margarita, like any other decent place would do... Total rip-off.   I got 2 tacos, which were OK. Nothing special. I noticed that avocado was $1 extra. I wasn't sure if that meant $1 total or $1 per taco so I clearly wrote down on the order sheet quantity 1 for the avocado, and the server still charged me $1 for each taco for avocado. Not to mention, it was one measly slice of avocado per taco. DEFINITELY not worth the $2.   I've heard the Tempe location honors the Taco Tuesday deals, but needless to say I don't intend on verifying that.   I'll be staying away from this place. Talking Stick Resort is the hidden gem for Taco Tuesday. $2 per taco no matter what kind, and no BS. :)",

The female bartender paid no attention to us and we were about to leave when the shorter bartender jumped in...   The food arrived shortly after we ordered and was excellent.  Taco and a burrito.  Our glasses were usually empty and if the original bartender was in charge of delivering the food, I'd still be sitting there waiting.....  Went back 3/4/19.. Different set of bartenders who went to training with the gal from Thursday...  A regular was getting a lot of attention from the guy behind the bar while 5 of us sat around hoping to get a beer...  The music was irresponsibility loud with the outside speakers distorting due to the volume.  It is clear no one on the front end of this business cares..  The cooks are keeping this place afloat as the food is great.  The rest of the place is a disaster.  Bars filthy, restaurants dirty and other than the diminutive bartender from Thursday the other bartenders should be put out of their misery.   Not a single one of the patrons wanted the music that loud and no one working there cared one bit...  Complete disinterest!  If you have hours to kill and want good food go, but bring ear plugs and a tremendous amount of patience...  Sorry to see a once great spot fall into this state of disrepair..",

The Salsa looked different/strange from the past \"Blenderfied\" would be the best way to describe, not even red but rather pink. We ordered the Loco Taco Salad with Steak and the Smothered Burrito.

Our waitress took our drink and food orders and then we didn't see her for almost thirty minutes. One of our party finally went and found her to ask about our drinks, after which she brought them right over. Let me mention, our drink orders were nothing special, just a beer and three well margaritas and the restaurant was barely half full. When our food came out about 15 minutes later, one order of fries was missing and one of the entrees was completely incorrect. She made it seem like getting the correct entree would take an additional 45 minutes, so my friend chose to keep the incorrect order. I got the Arizona Burro which was supposed to have avocado in it, but had none and was 90% unseasoned potatoes and 10% shredded beef. Then when our bill came, the entree he had chosen to keep was more expensive than the dish ordered. While the waitress did apologize for the mistakes, the whole experience was enough to ensure I will not be coming back.",

A bit busy but that's good that people were clamoring for seats. The enchilada with red sauce is pretty standard. The refried beans were tasty and the chips and salsa felt homemade. Could've used more drink but waitress was busy. Only reason for the 4 stars. I'll be back!",

    "text": "Loco Patron is great for what it is - a place to get drunk for cheap, and snack on what I like to call \"bar Mexican food\". There are a handful of places in very close proximity to Loco that also offer similarly priced \"bar Mexican food\", but I choose Loco every time over Salty's or Dos or San Felipe's.   I have drank here many times, eaten here many times, and overall I generally really like this bar. They've got a nice smoking patio with effective misters -- seriously where else do you see people on the patio in 110+ degree Arizona heat in summer besides Loco?  They've got a pretty good happy hour that goes until 7pm, offering lots of discounts on drinks. I'm pretty sure some or most of their appetizers are discounted during HH too, which is a plus for me.   The mahi mahi tacos are probably my favorite menu item. For $13 you get two pretty decent sized tacos on your choice of corn or flour tortillas filled with delicious grilled mahi mahi, pico, an avocado cream sauce, and caramelized onions. Yum. Oh, and your choice of two sides, but who gets anything besides rice and beans at a place like this anyway?  My least favorite thing about this bar is hands down their salsa. In my opinion, it doesn't have enough spice/kick to it, and tastes and looks very watered down. But they do offer several flavors of Cholula and Tobasco, so all is not lost ;-)",

I walked in with such a not so friendly hostess in cutoff shorts to the point where her cheeks were hanging out (it's scottsdale, I understand, but you're not in a club.) and proceeded to tell me to sit wherever, no big. but didn't come off with a friendly or welcoming vibe nor was I given a menu to look at. Anyway, my server comes and I ask for a bud light with water, after several minutes of waiting for my beer she gives me a bottle (they have it on draft and that is what I wanted, not that she asked me for my choices anyway) and as I was going to say something, she walked off knowing I was going to ask her something which kind of ticked me off actually. Then I pull the hostess over and ask for a draft and not a bottle. Then the server approaches me and says it will be a few minutes for them to change out the keg. Major turn off to just hand me a bottle i  didn't want because they're out. Anyway, it was changed in time and she gave me a draft. Then I ask for the steak and shrimp fajitas to which about 5 minutes later I forgot to tell her how I wanted the steak done which was actually her job to ask from the start. Finally, I felt that I had put more work as a customer to put my order in than I should have.  On a positive note, everything did come in a timely manner, and the food was excellent. I really like the atmosphere and their selections. Pricing is decent, and I will definitely come here again.",

We sat down for 20 minutes before flagging down a server to ask if they were doing table service. About 5 minutes after that a server finally came to take our order, however they came without menus. We ordered drinks and they took so long that I went to the bar and ordered a drink and finished it before the drink I ordered showed up. So if you want to wait an ungodly amount of time and be frustrated with your server for some pretty good but not spectacular food then by all means go for it, but I would suggest going next door instead to cold beer and cheeseburgers.",

You can tell a lot of the clientele are regulars (which is great) large amount of college guys and men still thinking they are college guys.  Had the chicken quesadilla ( it wasn't that great) how you ruin a quesadilla I'm not sure, chips tasted older and salsa was runny.  Friends had the wings they were good! Decor looks like a beachside bar in Rocky Point, cleanliness?? Look it's a dive type bar/restaurant I don't think they are trying to be anything other than that, could it have been dusted? Sure, chip or two or ten on the floor of course! Definitely not my favorite place but with sports on the TV, a good bar and a ton of ASU fans.....I'll live!",

It's not your typical carne asada fries you get at filibertos or any of his cousins shops. The cheese is like gravy, everyone has to try it you'll never want it any other way. And they have decent drink specials. The margaritas aren't pre made because it was super strong the next round.   The chicken wings are good and their enchiladas are good too. I gotta try their pork tacos next time since there's a huge trophy outside for first place at the taco festival. If you're expecting authentic Mexican than this is not the place but the food is still very good. The chips and salsa weren't all that great. The chips seemed stale and the salsa was watery.   This place is clean. It's about what you would expect out of a bar/restaurant on the boardwalk, it definitely has that feel when you are inside. Service is good and I bet this place is great at night. Perfect drunk food.    I would recommend the Carne Asada waffle fries!",

We were seriously craving some excellent Mexican food and found it at Loco Patron.   We sat at the bar outside and grabbed margaritas to start. YUM. The BEST fish tacos and ceviche I have EVER had. Now this is coming from someone whom has had the same 2 dishes in various parts ofMexico so this is a very strong opinion. But the Corona battered fried fish tacos were fantastic - complete with an avocado type sauce on the top of the tacos completed all of the flavors.   Great service and fantastic food!!!  To add to our trip for Spring Training this year, 2011, we were able to get 2 yummy doses of fried shrimp tacos, ceviche and margaritas. HEAVEN. We literally crave these tacos until we can go back to Scottsdale. Nightlife is also jumping on the outdoor patio and it's very lively. Buckets of beer = $15 for 5. Not too shabby!",

Got a plate of chips with a small mount of a weird melted white cheese on one side and a scoop of sour cream on the other. Beneath this was a scoop or two of black beans (straight from a can) with a good amount of oil. Some chunks of chicken, a few peppers. Not very pretty or appetizing. Had to eat most of it with fork and could not eat the bottom 1/4 of it as it was a mess of oil, runny cheese and soggy chips. Not much love put into this dish. My son had a couple of tacos, fish and chicken and his response was \".......not good\". Looks like the place does pretty well as there were a number of customers outside with us, but from the conversation it appeared that most were first timers also. As far as I am concerned, I was a first timer and a last timer. With the amount of Mexican style place in town, this is one that can be avoided, Also seemed a bit over priced, Nachos, 2 tacos and 2 margaritas came to almost $50. I know its Scottsdale but........",

    "text": "While searching for a place for some drinks and appetizers in Scottsdale the other night, some friends and I decided to pay Loco Patron a visit mostly due to their spacious outdoor seating. In all, while not the best experience, the time was enjoyable.  Star 1 - How was the service and atmosphere?  After seating ourselves, my party was promptly met by a friendly server who brought out our drinks before taking our orders for several platters of appetizers.  Outside of being just the right amount of attentive, the atmosphere at Loco Patron was comfortable, with a diverse crowd of 30-somethings and a friendly vibe. Star Granted.  Star 2 - How were the portions relative to the cost?  Admittedly, and possibly for the first time ever, I didn't keep track of the costs of our drinks and appetizers, but we did take advantage of the Happy Hour menu that consisted of fried goodies and decent drink specials.  At the end of the day, after ordering a huge plate of nachos, smashed potatoes, hot wings, a quesadilla, roughly six (weak) margaritas and four beers, our final tab for our party of six was roughly $125 after tax and tip. While I suppose $21 is a bit steep for a sampling or two of each of the appetizers and two drinks each, it wasn't unreasonable. Star Granted.  Stars 3/4 - How was the food?  While I can't speak for the normal menu, Loco Patron's Happy Hour menu was satisfying, and particular compliments go out to the hot wings and the generous portion of nachos. As is common, this isn't anything fancy, but if you're looking for a quick appetizer, Loco isn't a bad option. Single Star Granted.  Star 5 - Would you eat it every day if you could?  Would I come back again? Sure, especially since Loco Patron is very accommodating for larger crowds; however, with so many options in the area, I can't say I'd make Loco Patron a regular spot. No Star Granted.",

Saint Patricks day was pretty fun here in 2006.",

That all changed last night when I deviated from my normal Taco Tues spot and tried Loco's. These were seriously some of the best tacos I have ever had, the pork, the mahi, the chicken, all awesome! My new favorite Taco Tues place! As well, they have added more taps and more craft beers so its even more of what I love! Thanks Loco!",

    "text": "After a 12 hour drive, we got into town around 7pm on a Saturday night and checked into our hotel.  We were tired and needed a shower, but we were also starving and in need of cold refreshments.  We headed into Old Town and went by at least 10 places that had long waits, had nobody seated (which is always a bad sign on a Saturday night), or looked like they were a little more upscale than sweaty t-shirt and shorts attire.  By now it was around 8 o'clock and we decided to take a chance on Loco.  They were slammed, too, but we found a booth in the corner and took a seat.  Let me be the first to tell you that we were not expecting much - chain restaurant, young crowd which usually means the beer is cheap and the food is edible \"enough\" (hey, I was a college kid not too long ago and things haven't changed), and terrible service if you're not a local or someone they know.  We. were. totally. surprised.  And, in a good way.  Our server, Emilee, greeted us quickly and took our drink order and one of the other servers brought us chips and salsa.  Emilee came back a short while later and told us that our beers would be coming and she took our order - their \"award winning\" pork tacos with refried beans and a side salad, and two different enchiladas with the same sides.  Our beers arrived soon as did our salads.  The good-sized salads were extremely fresh with lots of different veggies.  Wow, we thought as we wolfed them down.  The rest of the meal was served right when we were finishing the salads and I have to say that everything was good.  Including the beans, which is usually the worst part of the meal at most Mexican restaurants.  Good food, good service despite the crowd, quick kitchen.  We left sated and with smiles on our faces.  Pretty damn impressed, too.",

I come to this place quite often, so often I recognize some of the servers and bartenders and usually always a good experience but I recently had the worst experience with this new bartender. My girl friend and I were catching up ready to go out and bar hop a little, keep in mind this was our first stop. The bartender introduced himself to us as \"Lazer\" but I heard his coworkers call him Lance. He kept objectifying us and I heard him call other customers \"hoes\" and other sorts of names under his breath. I called him out on it and he thought it was joke. When I asked a server who the manager was she pointed at HIM. From then on I vowed to not give them my service I ever saw his face.",

We had a variety of tacos and enchiladas, along with the obligatory queso and guacamole that is necessary when eating Mexican food. All of our dishes tasted great. A couple of gf's ordered watermelon margaritas, and I heard they were great, but my mojito was just so so. The other fru fru drinks that were ordered were also tasty, but I doubt any semi- seasoned bartender can mess up those kinds of drinks. The service was ok. Our waitress was really nice and friendly, but it took around 10 years for her to deliver the waters, chips and salsa to our table, and another 5 or 6 years to get our bill. While there were an additional 4 ppl dining within the restaurant at the same time, the slowness was a bit ridiculous. The ambiance is great, the water misters were a great reprieve from the 100 degree heat, and the price point was . I'd definitely recommend it for a casual, semi- quick dining experience when visiting Scottsdale.",

Carne asada fries, carne asada burrito, chicken sandwich, kids quesadilla. But overall, the service is what we'll return for!

Server wAs nice and quick. We ordered drinks, nachos and tacos and enchiladas. Nachos - i would give it 3/5 because i didnt like the steak and cheese wAs more creamy philadelphia cheese rather than the melted usual. Tacos- canne with 2 sides ( i got what they called mashed potatoes and spanish rice): the potatoes are not mashed, theyre small roasted potatoes. The rice was ok.  Grilled shrimp and grilled mAhi tacos were good but not the best in Scottsdale.  Enchilladas were average.  Its a hangout place with TVs and music. The food is average.",

I don't ever think I have been to this place when it does not have a good group of people hanging out.    The Scottsdale location puts Local Patron between the bar side of Old Town Scottsdale and the Club side.  Here you find a great mixture of the dressed up Scottsdale folks as well as a t-shirt wearing crowed.  I hope to see more positive reviews on this place, see for your self why this bar has a large following.",

That's where the searches are taking place. Steve Jobs even said so in a video. I know because I saw the video.   Anyway, on this particular day, my former boss says, \"Dave, how do you feel about Loco Patron\". I said...\"works for me.\"   So the first paragraph of this review was completely meaningless.  In any case, we sat outside on the patio for lunch, and I ordered the steak salad. The steak was cooked to perfection, the dressing captured the True essence of all things salad, and the greens weren't wilted. They were crisp, fresh and delightful.  The service wasn't memorable, but it wasn't bad.   Love,  Me.",

The only thing it has going for it, is that, it is dead on Thursday nights to watch Thursday night football.  This past Thursday (12/4/14) was no expectation. Let me just say, that I have been in the service industry my whole adult life. I've done everything from washing dishes,  hosting, serving, and bartending. I get it. Off days happen. I don't think this was the case.  Our server was....awful. She barely acknowledged us and was inconvenienced to tell us what beers were on draft. When our good arrived, 75% of the orders were wrong. Instead of shredded beef, we all got ground beef. Not a big deal. I'm still going to eat it, but she never came by to ask how everything was. We sat there with empty beer glasses and greasy ground beef. When she saw that we were finished with our food, she handed us our tab and never cleared the table. We paid our bill and apparently she couldn't wait for us to leave to pick up the back book. She opened it up in front of us before we even had a chance to sign the slip. I have NEVER written a bad review before and NEVER tipped less the 20%. I just think that bad service and attitudes shouldn't be enabled. Oh and I forgot to mention the ear piercing full bass techno music that was playing  during the game. Sure it's the bears and the cowboys, I personally could care less, but those are somebody else's teams that want to hear what's going on.  Come on Loco Patron, get it together!",

    "text": "Walking around Scottsdale during lunch time.  Decided to stop in here rather than walk a few more blocks to Los Dos.  In hindsight, we should have walked!  Party of 6, 4 adults, 2 kids.  I ordered the tortilla soup - $6 for a bowl.  It was good, lots of chicken and was tasty.  When I asked for chips to put into my soup, I was told that we woud be charged for more chips because we had already received 2 chip portions and they charged $2 for more chips after that.  This did not please me.  We had 6 people at the table and the chip \"baskets\" that they use could not possibly have more than 1 cup of chips per basket.  I have NEVER been told that there was a charge for chips in a mexican food restaurant.  I will note though, that this place does not really qualify as mexican - think Tex Mex.    I thought that the serving sizes were pretty measily for the prices they charge.  One person at our table ordered two tacos with beans and rice ($10).  The tacos were very small and were served with about 4 Tablespoons each of beans and rice.  BUT, if you like lettuce, you'd be in for a treat!  Half the plate space was taken up with shredded lettuce to fill the space that should have had FOOD on it!  My kids split the chicken tenders and fries plate (also $10).  They received 4 tenders and a handful of waffle fries.  I don't know that we've ever paid $10 for something that would normally be on a kids menu at any other place for about $6.  It looked like our server was serving the entire restaurant.  We motioned to two girls who were standing near the chips talking.  They both came over and asked if we needed something.  We said we were ready to order and they said that they would find our server because they were \"training.\"  They only thing we saw them do was stand and talk over at the chip counter.      Considering how many great places there are to eat in the area, I would not chose to eat here again.  Can't really find anything that makes this place stand out from any other ho-hum place.  The price of the food and what actually was on the plate did not seem to correlate to each other.  No thanks",

Loco Patron knows how to do Taco Tuesday and pretty much happy hour, including reverse happy hour! Love love love it! They want you to stay and they do everything to make you enjoy being planted in your bar stool. First off, the DJ spins beats that flirt with you to burn some calories before partaking in the caloric intake. Bartenders are not only easy on the eyes, but they know how to serve up fun and goodness. My fave are their salt and pepper wings, get a side of hot sauce to dip even though they are so good naked. The shrimp tostadas are amaze balls, order several because you won't share. With the drink specials, you won't realize you might have slammed several beers and decided to buy the entire patio a round of shots to join you in your drunken fest of happiness. You'll never look at your phone, even to capture the pixels of a really good time!",

The owner messaged me that he would look into it and take care of me. That was several weeks ago and he's done nothing. So again I can't stress enough to beware of this place and there over priced food and terrible service.",

After we asked one of the servers for help we watched two other tables come in and get helped before we even got acknowledged. We finally went up and asked for a either a server or manager, they said the manager was working behind the bar and couldn't speak. After 10 more minutes of watching the servers walk around and not say a thing to us we got up and left. The only reason I'd come back is if that busser was our server. Didn't catch his name, but he had longer blonde hair and was the only person that spoke to us in the 30 minutes we were there. Thanks man!",

    "text": "I have been to this location several times because again, right around the corner from my salon. I so want to be able to give it a higher rating but every time I go the service is really not that great. Last week I went for wing and Wii night, 30 cent wings cant be beat. I have had better wings, but hey this is a Mexican joint and our bill was not even $4! But our waitress looked like she could care less about being there, never asked if we wanted a refill on our chips and salsa and never stopped by the table to see if we like our food. Now being in the service industry and having spent many years as a server I get that you think since the bill is so low your tip is going to suck. That simply doesn't have to be the case, we left our server a $6 tip and we weren't even there long. You get 4 tables like that an hour you are set, so perk up and smile, you never know how far that can go.  I went there last night for Taco Tuesdays, $1 to $2 tacos can't be beat and the tacos are so tasty I always order 3, the mahi, crunchy fish and steak. The mahi was flaky and sweet, the crunchy taco had a sweet taste to it with the sauce and red onion. Not greasy at all. The steak was tender and flavorful. Again though our service was sub par. We had already finished our chips and salsa before we even got our water, took way to long, same with the food and it wasn't even that busy. We were sitting inside and there were only 20 people in the bar area and there was only one other table eating. Now our server wrote our order on her had, she seemed tired and frazzled, and we had to bring our bill to her at the end to check out, we waited a while before doing that. It seemed like she might have been the only server in the place, but she did have the help of a gentleman by the name of Frenchy. I liked Frenchy, big dude but with dry wit and he seemed like the jack of all trades for the place. Doorman, food runner, busser, you name it he was doing it.  I will continue to come to Loco because the tacos are so damn good but I just hope they figure out the staff issues. I gave it 4 times and every time my complaint is the same, the service needs to step it up.",

In all honestly, I wasn't expecting much, so I ordered the fish taco, was reasonable priced. The fish was flavorful, crunchy and juicy, also it was a very generous fish filet on the taco. I chose to not pay extra for avocado, I truly love avocados(if avocado was a man, I would so marry him) any way, not thinking that would enhance the flavor I had a plain taco. They brought it out promptly, I took a bite and OMG! Best fish taco I've had in this country. The Mayo dressing was GREAT! The queso was a nice autentico touch. For less than 3 bucks it was really good. I was tremendously impressed. Service was quick, everything was tasty, and the taco Tuesday special is AWESOME. The taco I had was so good I would pay full price :)  My son really liked his generous kids meal, my husband even had a naked taco, which he actually needs to have more of, since it's a taco made with lettuce wrap. I was presently surprised with their food, and free chips and salsa! Just can't beat that!  We'll be coming back.",

We are all servers and understand how hard it can be on a super busy night, but our waitress barely even acknowledged us. We never got a single refill even though we asked directly for one and some of the extras we ordered with the food never came. When we would ask our waitress for something, she wouldn't even let us finish our sentence before walking away. I get how crazy Tuesdays can be, but at least acknowledge what we asked for.",

    "text": "My friend and I were just asked to leave this establishment. When we sat down the bartender thought we were drunk. We were not, just hard of hearing because it's fairly loud. Also, when you have a diagnosed hearing loss, it's hard to hear period. We ordered a few drinks and the bartender asked us to what we were unhappy about when he interjected into our conversation. When I talked about my feelings as a woman who has been raped and sexually assaulted, he turned away and ignored us. At this point our neighbors asked us about things and we laughed and chatted with them for a decent amount of time, until the bartender asked us to leave. I firmly believe it was because he didn't align with me or my male counterparts beliefs. They are a private establishment and can ask any one leave, and I respect that as a business owner; but he was super rude and biased against us from the moment we sat down. So we paid and left and now I'm writing this review. I'm really livid because as a local resident I have had similar occurrences, as have my friends, who aren't hard core right. I mean. I'm middle of the road and there's no tolerance in the greater Phoenix area. As a business owner myself I will on no way support this business, because left or right, people get to have an opinion specially if you are the one that ho asked it in the first place. The man who had been serving us from the moment who walked in, when he told us to leave, asked me to leave and he would bring our change out. I refused this request and tried to hand him cash, when he then declared he wasn't our bartender, and pointed at some woman who had never even looked our way all night. All in all we paid and left. It's been several years since someone has  even so horrible to me, and it's just really hard to accept. If we were drunk or obnoxious, fine. But we were literally laughing with our neighbors from Pittsburg, when we were asked to leave.   Also their margaritas were pretty gross I really don't care for agave and they use that in their sweet and sour sauce. However if you like agave you will probably love these. I preferred Bario Queens or Diego Pops which we have been to in previous downtown scottsdale visits.",

My fiance was glaring at him and they made eye contact but he continued to ignore me. I had my card and ID out ready to order a drink and he wasn't busy, just at the other end of the bar doing his own thing and not making eye contact or anything at all.. he finally comes up to me after 5 minutes of ignoring me, by this point my fiance is already half way out of the door, the bartender asks \"what can I do for you\" and I just looked at him so mad and disappointed and told him \"nothing\" and we walked out.

I just got a beer and a quesadilla and they were both decent but nothing special.  My problem with the place was the service. It was a little too lax.

The music is loud, which is perfect for the atmosphere and vibe here.  Since we already had dinner, we were only here for cold Beer.  I had a Dos XX Lager and the rest of the group had Heineken.  Service here was so/so.  Our server started out well by getting us our drinks right away, but she wasn't too attentive as the night went on....we had to flag her down whenever we needed a refill.  Although we weren't eating, we received complimentary Chips & Salsa....they were average.  The Salsa is very mild, no kick to it at all...what I like to call, Tomato Sauce Salsa.  I'll have to come back and try the food.  Return Factor - 70%",

First off we weren't greeted for at least five minutes and we were never brought menus- so just ended up filling out the taco cards they have. Took ten more minutes for her to bring us water *without* the lemon we asked for. Food came out fast and was pretty good except she gave my friend one less taco than she had asked for. Server never came back once the food was dropped, had to flag down a different server to refill our waters. Our server dropped our checks and took 10 more minutes to come back and cash us out. Was really disappointing service, we're all servers too. Maybe because we're relatively young she wasn't taking us seriously as guests. Won't be back.",

We specified what we wanted on our tacos, but when they came out they had everything on them.  Not great for picky eaters or those with allergies.   Also, it was 7pm on a Spring Break Monday.  Not many people there, but they had no steak (which was featured on the menu).   Nothing really wrong or bad, just not a destination.

I love their chips & salsa, and they wait staff is always good about making sure you have plenty of it. After the chips & salsa I usually get the black & pepper wings, which are excellent. You wouldn't expect good wings at a Mexican food place, but they're really good here. For my main dish their hard shelled tacos are the best, but I've had several other things and it's always consistent. Lunch or dinner this is a great quick casual Mexican food spot.  Although I do like their food the best thing about this place is the atmosphere or more specifically the patio. If it's Spring Training time or if it's nice out during the day it's hard to beat this place. Grab a cold Corona & kick it on the patio in the sun!",

We had the cactus pear Jumbo Margarita (on the rocks) which was recommended to me by the waitress. It was no bueno. The taste was no different than any other margarita you could find in a bottle at 7-11. All you could taste was the syrup, which left us wondering if they put any liquor in the $20 drink.  Overall I wouldn't go for the margaritas but maybe try a different drink.",

The wings are so crispy and fried to perfection. Their waffle fries are the best!! Would come back just for them. Make sure to save room for a cookie skillet and churros. The wait staff is very friendly and comfortable around us. They do not provide straws unless you ask. The bucket of beer is a steal at $20 for 5 beers.",

    "text": "Hubby and I invited to a  HH and we all met at the Loco Patron. We came in a little late so others in our group ordered a pretty large selection of bar food. Hubs and I added to that order with cheese curds and a shrimp ceviche. As far as drinks go, I ordered a Tito's and soda, twist of lime. All was going great until a darling female friend asked the bartender for another drink for me. Skillet, the bartender was in the corner talking to the waitresses, EASILY dismissed her drink order and when she turned around, he mouthed, \"what the f*ck\" as he looked at her, her back turned to him. I was SHOCKED and very upset. For someone representing the Loco Patron brand, if this is how an employee treats paying customers I'd rather give my money/business somewhere else.  Spoke to the GM, Lance and he said he would take care of the situation but I need to let the business owner know of this disaster of a bartender and his disrespect to paying customers.  Our bill was big, $300 and a $100 cash tip - we're pretty fair people and we know there are others such as the chef, waitresses, bar backs, etc who hopefully got some of that tip.   If you want to be talked about, behind your back.....sit at the bar and let Skillet the bartender serve you. What a piece of work. My first and last time there.  Skillet, if you read this....you need to show a little respect, smile a little bit more and whatever chip you have on your shoulder, let it go. The girl you spoke about behind her back has a brother with stage 4 stomach cancer so she's kinda going a lot and the ONE night she went out, you spoke poorly of her. Yeah, you are probably the type who will deny it but I saw you, I heard you and I watched you. Shame on you.",

The habanero margarita was lip-smacking delicious.  My enchiladas were on point and the amount of food you get for what you pay is insane.  You will definitely leave full and satisfied with your meal.  Sitting outside people watching late night is the best part of this area.

I ordered the frozen peach margarita, crunchy pork street tacos, and Spanish rice.   Margarita: my margarita was not blended at all--the  syrup, which was room temperature, sat on the bottom of the glass...gross. There was also a disproportional amount of syrup (probably 1/3 was the peach syrup) making my drink very weak. In addition, I asked for my drink to have a salt rim, which it did not.  Tacos: My avocados on top were dry as if they had been sitting out. The pork was overlooked and dry.   Spanish Rice: I never received my rice, which wasn't surprising given the subpar service. The only bonus was that they did not add the rice to my bill.  The only reason I gave this place a 2 instead of a 1 was for the relatively low prices during Happy Hour. I will not dine here again.",

Outside the bar there was a sign that read \"$1 American beers 3pm-6pm\" the sign clearly EXPLICITLY stated until 6pm. When we inquired about the beer special the gentleman in the american flag t-shirt rudely informed us that the special \"was only good until the end of the game and the game is over. The sign was only there to attract customers for the game and we are no longer offering the special.\"   Needless to say this business certainly lost a new group of customers. When you advertise something you should honor it. I work in customer service and I would never treat anyone this way. There were many other possible outcomes for this situation that would've provided us a positive experience. We made our way next door to Cold Beers and Burgers and happily gave them our business.   I would encourage whomever owns or manages this business to correct their signage before wrongly \"correcting\" their customers. We definitely will not be returning to this bar. Not only was there False advertising but the person behind the bar was also incredibly unfriendly.",

Then we ordered drinks, but only some people could order appetizers immediately and others were told that our waitress was not ready for food.   We waited for 20 minutes for our drinks and we ran out of water. Our waitress never came by and I had to motion to the bartender to get some water. After this, we received a pitcher of water from the bartender. We waited a bit longer and our waitress finally brought our drinks and the appetizers that were put in before. A couple of our friends tried to put appetizers in again, but were not able to get their order in until our waitress asked what we wanted for our entree.   My friends and I got the fundito cheese dip that contained chorizo. This was not too bad and was a tasty dip. The complimentary chips and salsa are horrendous and the salsa tastes like water and tomato.  I got the hangover burrito and crunchy tacos (beef and pork). The tacos were good, but the burrito was very plain and we were not impressed. The appetizers that my friends were trying to order finally came in AT THE SAME TIME AS OUR FOOD even though they asked for this before the entree. One of my friends was the last person to get her food and her food was cold. She told a bartender that the food was cold and was told that because we have a large party, we should expect that our food would be cold because there were so many of us.   Then we were given our check that was already split for us. We gave them our credit cards and did not have them returned until another 20 minutes later when we asked another service person for our checks and credit cards back. After all of this, they added an additional charge to our bill for gratuity with this service.",

Same with salt shakers and hot sauces.

Pro tip, skip the rice and beans and just order more tacos, because when has anyone ever said they wished they had more rice and beans and less tacos.....never that's when.  The one thing that irritates me is that if you want a hot salsa the only option they have is a habanero salsa which is absolutely delicious but they charge you for it!  it's only like 75 cents, but come on, when do you ever get charged extra for a spicy salsa at a Mexican food restaurant?

They even had a great mayo based sauce for the smashed potatoes! (Can you tell I like potatoes?)   The service was always quick, and the lunch special price was really competitive.   For whatever reason, however, the menu changed and I was no longer able to get these items for lunch, and the food tasted pretty different. New cooks or management, perhaps? I went a few times afterwards to see if I fell in love with anything else, but sadly, the charm was lost.   I still know people that frequent the restaurant, so I hesitate to say that it lost its quality completely, so give it a chance! It might still be your thing.",

It's close to where we live, and has a cool setup, but the truth is that the only reason that I am not giving them 1 star is because they gave us 10% off our bill for such a horrible experience (at least they did that much).  We had a 5:30 reservation on a Saturday night, 3 adults, 1 child.  When we arrived, we ordered drinks and a few apps.  We ordered our main dishes a little before 6:00, hoping to be out of there around 6:45 or 7:00 at the latest, to get my daughter to bed.  It was nearly 7:00 when I went looking for our waiter who was nowhere to be found, and it had been at least an hour and our food had still not arrived.  We hadn't seen him in at least 30 minutes at this point.  Not only at our table, but anywhere in the restaurant.  I don't know if he went on break or what.  Couldn't find him, so I tracked down another employee and asked if he could help get us a status update.  In that hour or so after we ordered, our waiter came by once or maybe twice, and never once mentioned anything about a delay with the food.  Finally a little after 7:00 he comes by and apologizes, says the kitchen is really backed up, \"Unfortunately nothing we could do.\"  Says the food is coming up shortly.  At this point we decide that my wife is going to have to take her food to go so she can get my daughter home, and I'll have to Uber it home with my friend later on.  So about 10 minutes later, now about 7:20, our food finally arrives.  My wife boxes up her meal and my daughter's meal, and she heads home.  Our food wasn't even very warm.  It felt like it had been sitting out for awhile or something.  I was thinking, \"Well maybe the food will be great and at least that will help salvage the experience.\"  Nope.  It was very average at best.  We weren't impressed.  At some point a guy came over and said he'd take 10% off our bill, so I appreciated that, and they did do that.  Our waiter seemed totally clueless though and he just kept saying, \"Unfortunately there is nothing we could have done.\"  I'm thinking, yes you could have the right amount of staff, you could have come and told us the kitchen was backed up awhile ago, you could literally have done just about anything else and it would have been better than ignoring us for most of the night and then acting like a restaurant actually getting a few tacos out to customers in less than 90 minutes from the time they ordered was some impossible circumstance.  I won't hold this last part against the restaurant, but to add insult to injury, my wife gets home and is trying to get our daughter in the door while carrying 3 styrofoam to-go boxes.  The top one slides off, and her meal explodes onto our tile floor.  I had to attach the picture because it's too funny (now that we can laugh about it).  Parking was actually a pain too.  We had to drive around and wait until someone left.  Tried going further away but the signs for the other businesses said we could be towed.  We won't be going back.  This was one of the worst restaurant experiences we've ever had unfortunately.  Was hoping this could be an alternative to driving further to Blanco (our usual go-to), but alas, Blanco is for sure worth the extra 10 minutes in the car each way compared to this experience.  Horrible service, average food at best, difficult parking, and \"Unfortunately there was nothing they could do about it.\"",

Margaritas were yummy and not watered down at all. Wait staff was very attentive; always making sure we had plenty of water, and if we needed anything else once our food arrived. About the only complaint I have is the windows were all open to the patio and it was way too cold for open air environment. I was shivering the entire meal.  Highly recommend this place other than dress warmly on those cold nights!",

Taco Tuesday was bomb and you've got to try the crunchy tacos. Being downtown you have easy access to other places to go afterwards to grab more drinks.   ---- and to the details ---- We came here to meet up with friends and the restaurant was pretty packed. We eventually found a table on the patio and the server came pretty quick to greet us. She eventually brought us menus and some water after walking past several times.   Once we got our menus we ordered WAY too many taco Tuesday tacos. They have soft shell flour and corn along with their famous, award winning crunchy tacos. You're able to add additional toppings (avocado, etc) for extra as well as some taco Tuesday shots to your order.   After giving out order, which you wrote on a piece of paper and hand over we quickly got our tacos! Presentation was good (better than the picture, I promise) and the tacos were bomb. I thought the crunchy tacos were great but they weren't crazy extra good - I really enjoyed the soft shell ones as well.   The place was pretty packed with a typical representation of a Scottsdale crowd. We enjoyed our time here though. I'd definitely come here for another taco Tuesday deal!",

The menu seems to have changed, but just the menu and prices, not the actual food on the menu. Anything with grilled chicken is pretty good on the menu and although not the greatest enchilada's, the choice of poblano cream sauce really amped up some basic food. The side portions could be bigger as I got three smashed potatoes and a small portion of decent Mexican rice for $13.     The other dish was fish tacos ($13) which got another average reaction. Oh yeah, the Baja ranch sauce on those fish tacos is actually the Chipotle ranch dressing served with the potatoes.",

The free chips (just average) and salsa were a decent start to the meal.   I ordered three tacos - a soft corn tortilla with shrimp (meh...), a hard shell taco with pork (the worst of the three), and a soft flour tortilla with crispy fish (clearly the shining star of the bunch and the only reason for the second star).    But it was Taco Tuesday after all... so I figured I would try a margarita and make the most of my guy time!  Unfortunately, my drink tasted more like margarita-flavored water than an actual margarita.  Ugh...  Being Taco Tuesday, they were super busy (which I thought was a good sign)... but all it really meant was that I was going to have to wait and wait and wait to place a drink order... and a food order... and to get more chips... and to pay our bill.   I get the appeal of this place with its prime location on Scottsdale Road, open-air setting, and fun atmosphere... but there are too many incredible Mexican restaurants to experience to settle for the ok place in a cool location.  **TWO STARS**",

The Crunchy tacos -  shredded pork, beef or chicken - are the best ever tacos! All good meat-no weird tendons, parts or lumps of strange grisly fat. Nice slice of avocado with some salsa and it's perfection in a shell. Plus it's a Green Bay Packer and Bucky Badger bar - so you can never go wrong with fellow Wisconsinites!

Anyways we came across Loco Patron and decided that was a good option for a restaurant. I will say this, the place itself is not bad. Its the service that was so disappointing. I can understand a server not knowing much about the menu. In fact that would be perfectly acceptable. What is not acceptable is a server that seems bothered to be asked simple questions from someone who has never been there and needs a little help making a selection. I tried asking on 3 different occasions and each time i got a very short, annoyed response. Needless to say, I ended up picking something that I didnt really care for because i felt rushed and uncomfortable asking more questions. Her input and genuine willingness to help would have been greatly appreciated considering it was our first time there. I never write reviews on anything but Its a shame that what should have been a good experience turned out to be such a dissapointment.",

We made a mistake by not realizing that the french fries were breaded(a likely allergen) until after our son had eaten several of them. Our server, Rachel was very concerned about our situation and asked the cook for an ingredient list on the french fries.  The cook went over and above getting the ingredient list.  Fortunately none of our son's allergens were on the list. We are just so thankful for the kindness that the server and cook showed us.",

The music is rather not good (they played madonna) and the place is just kind of .... there. I had an indifferent 3 star experience until I had a little run in with the bartender. I took a sip of my bottled beer and it was room temp. I called him over and asked if I could have the bill for our warm beers. He offered to \"get something else that might be colder\" and I declined. He then said if you don't want something else then why bitch about it dude? Whatever, I was trying to show my girl a good time for her 21st and didn't want to get in a big argument so I let it go.   Mark my words, I'll never go back. That was some serious attitude that was unnessecary.",

Its never by choice, obviously the Patron has a few faithful fans but I have yet to find the fun at Loco.  Next door to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant right on Scottsdale Rd, this patio is usually pretty packed.  Which adds to my frustration.  Everyone is smooshed onto this gated in patio, talking about how much they hate the bar.  What, like there arent a dozen other places to go to within 20 feet?  The bar took forever with our drinks and I felt like the bartenders were talking trash about patrons.  Youre not cooler than us except for the fact that youre making money at this dump instead of spending it.    Speaking of drinks, I havent ever had a great one (read: \"great\"=strong) and prices are just like every other place like this.  Food is mediocre and I usually try not to eat just so everyone can tell how much I dispise it here.    Never have I met someone fun or worth knowing here, and since I can make friends with a doorknob, this is a serious statement.  Happy Hour?  Dinner?  People watching?  Youre Loco.",

When I lived in Scottsdale I would occasionally stop here when gallivanting through Old Town for a drink or two. Nothing is really memorable about the place. It's a cheesy, Baja-style bar. I've never had the food, so I can't comment on it, but the margaritas are okay. I don't think the drink prices are exuberant or anything, there fine. When I was in town for a recent visit I used this place as a bridge between other bars, pretty much like I used to do. It's not a bad place to stop at for a drink or two when your out with friends, but not the place you'll want to hang out at all night. It's okay.",

    "text": "Wish I could rate negative stars.... With so many bar choices this place is by far the worst.  Last Saturday a group of friends went out for a friend's birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron. It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early. We finished our last call drinks and started to head out. The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom. At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave. My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving (friends still in bathroom) but was quickly cut off. I watched from the patio as the two bouncers (both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out. As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him. The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment, pinned him down with their elbows and hit him. At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him. I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force. We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. He swiped my friend's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground. Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive. The police arrived and took down the bouncers' information and stated that they would be recording this incident.   I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening, non physical patrons of their establishment. Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves. What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of. These people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law.",

They have great lunch specials, and the service is always quick.  If you like tostadas, theirs is quite unique, they top them with a creamy avocado sauce...yum!  They also make a mean Chambord Margarita, and the patio is a great place for people watching when the weather is nice.

Well it's sad when a business ends a promotion that has treated them so well,  what's worst is coming to a place regularly for Taco Tuesday , for Tacos and Margaritas and ordering your normal order then getting the bill and seeing the prices doubled.  SAY IT AIN'T SO JOE.   You think our bartender or waitress would have mentioned something, when we brought it up to the Manager Joe , he just said it wasn't his decision and shurrugged his shoulders.    So frustrating might be time to find a new place while the bar stuff is good looking they are always looking at their phones and not their guests.   Something wrong with this generation that doesn't know how too work hard.   As for the food. Still good enough. Worth a stop but unless your hot 18 to 23.   Don't expect any service.    Love the pork tacos and salt and pepper wings are a tasty twist.  Food always holds it ownevne if they doubled their prices on Tuesdays.",

The bouncer was very nice too, surprisingly.  The patio has nice heaters on it, so we were okay to sit outside after dark in December.  My vodka cranberry was strange - no ice, the cranberry was NOT juice. It was a water consistency but tasted somewhat like a cranberry syrup. Friend's pineapple/Bacardi looked like real pineapple juice though. Weird.  The wings were pretty good, just fatty.

    "text": "It pains me to give this place 2 stars because I am in love with their tacos, the sauce they put on them is so delicious.  However, what kind of place with a full service menu starts carding at 5 pm everyday!?! I used to come for Taco Tuesday last year, when I was only 20, and have tacos. Sometimes they started carding kind of early (7 pm-ish) but normally they didn't start until around 8. Still a bit early but not outrageously so. I attempted to bring my friend for tacos last week. Even though I am now 21, she is not. We arrived around 6:30 pm, and were told that we could not enter the establishment because she wasn't 21. The bouncer told us they card at 5 pm everyday (earlier on Sundays) and  we could come back with a parent or guardian. UM, not only are we college students whose parents live out of state, even if they were nearby, what 20 year old would even bother doing that?! It's like being under 13 again and not being able to go to the public pool without your mommy or daddy....it's just ridiculous.  The logic of this policy baffles me...there were young children there with their parents eating dinner. I really just don't get the point of letting 10 year olds in with a parent but not someone who is 20...not like it was prime drinking hour!!  Carding at 8-9 makes sense when it started becoming more bar than restaurant, but if you are going to have a full service menu, it's just stupid.  Since Loco Patron apparently did not want our money, we went across Scottsdale Road to El Hefe and had delicious tacos and guacamole. :) They impressed me there, giving us the happy hour deal on tacos even though we arrived just after HH technically ended. Fabuloso!",

How do you come to a table, after being waved down, and not ask everyone if they need another drink. Specially when the glass is empty. Then we had to stop her again before she took off because two others needed a drink. Then she brings the drink back, sets it at the edge of the table and doesn't even take the empty. Had to ask for more chips, than our check, didn't see if it was separate checks even tho the second half of our party came later. We pretty much stumped her with \"put 50 on the blue card and the rest on the other\". Maybe she should go home, since we seemed to be bothering her.",

Everything was so good & flavorful. The service was excellent, our waitress had the best sense of humor ever - it's too bad I forgot her name (oops). And, the music was awesome until some youngins showed up and put a few dollars in the juke box. It's definitely a great place and we will definitely return to try other items on the menu.

I ordered he steak and pork crunch tacos. You CAN'T go wrong. I also recommend the 'street taco' the salsa that comes on that...WOW...yes please, sign me up, I want!!!!!   The chips and guac is great too! They put fresh cilantro on the chips which allows the flavor to spread amongst the chips...seriously an awesome twist I've never experienced.

My group and I walked in shortly after midnight and advised the kitchen was closing in 10. The place was empty with the exception of one other group. Initial drinks took a while to get to us but the wait for the food was well worth it! Only thing I would suggest to the restaurant is that they should have actual flavorful salsa made from scratch and not the typical Tapatio or Cholula. Strange to come to a \"Mexican\" restaurant/cantina and it not be an option.",

Come to find out there was only ONE WAITRESS, ONE BAR TENDER which was the Manager! And the cook. We all bump into life situations I am sure they didn't intend for it to be this way. They were actually the best host we could have had. There attitudes remained happy and respectful. The entire place was filled with dishes and left over food on each table. While customers are still coming. They held there own! Me and my boyfriend out of kindness because that's who we are to help bust the tables. We felt so bad for them. She has a long day ahead of her but honestly I don't think there could be anyone else better for the position. I want to give a huge shoot out to Tim and Melissa B!! And the food was BOMB! So freaken GOOD! loved everything about this beautiful disaster. The vibes were relaxing and she never once got frustrated. Neither did he. We will be back! Thanks guys! Keep up the killer attitudes and work. #skills",

We originally only arrived with 3 people, but the party grew to 5 and the booth was able to accommodate the size.   Our waitress was friendly and attentive, great service. As we sat down we were served chips and salsa. The vibe is very casual, indoor and outdoor seating available, and sports were playing on each television.  Everyone ordered margaritas and after tasting the different various varieties, I definitely think the original is the best.  I ordered the two-taco deal, fish and beef, and both were so great.   I do not live in Phoenix, but I definitely want to return here when I am back in town.",

    "text": "3/13/2018 Yelp Review Loco Patron Scottsdale, AZ 4228 N Scottsdale Rd, Scottsdale, AZ 85251 (480) 874-0033  On Tuesday nights at Loco Patron in Old Town it can be difficult to find a table, but usually after 5-10 minutes of waiting my friends and I are able to snag one on the patio. The Mexican-themed restaurant/bar itself is built similar to other restaurants in Old Town, with a small interior and a larger patio jutting out to give great views of the city. The restaurant is located in the heart of Old Town next to Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers, and less than a block away from Scottsdale Fashion Square. If you sit inside, the lighting is fantastic with bright walls which feature giant murals of the beach. The bar top features a patio seating side, with an open window to serve patrons sitting at the bar top outside.   Despite how busy it is every time I've been there,  there is always a friendly, upbeat server who brings water and drinks to the table in a timely manner. The servers never seem to be overwhelmed by the large volume of customers and are attentive. The food is always delivered to the table promptly. I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for food, and at slower hours I receive my meal in 10 minutes.   After living in Arizona for over 15 years, I have eaten many tacos and have become somewhat picky about them at certain restaurants. A lot of restaurants throw a few bland pieces of chicken and lettuce onto tortillas, but not Loco Patron. They stuff their tacos to the top of the tortillas and serve them in taco holders to keep them warm and from falling apart. My favorite item is their \"Award-winning crunchy chicken tacos\". The crispy shells are filled with seasoned fried chicken, sour cream, pico de gallo, avocado, and sprinkled white cheese at the top. I would also recommend the \"crispy fish tacos\" which are filled with fried fish and topped with marinara sauce and what tasted like blended cheeses and some sprinkled cheese on top. They also serve a basket of chips and salsa on the house. The salsa tastes a little strange, so I always order a side of guacamole with them instead. If you're wanting dessert afterwards, try the sopapillas. Their bowl of vanilla ice cream with sugary dough bites is delicious.  The prices are fair for the quality of food and the location they are in. The tacos range in price from $4-$5 per taco and have the option of a $12 taco plate with two tacos and two sides. The best deals are (obviously) on Taco Tuesday, which features the fish tacos and a few other soft tacos for $2 each and the crunchy chicken tacos for $3 each. Chips and guacamole are served for $4 on Tuesdays. The most expensive entrees on the menu are $14.   Overall, Loco Patron has great Mexican food and is in a great location. One word of advice: if you go on a Tuesday, head out to dinner earlier. They are always packed at night and occasionally run out of some items. [529 wds.]",

It was pretty crowded got there around 6 but they had seats at the bar on the patio which was perfect since it was a nice night. They had a dj who was great playing everything drink specials and tacos were cheap and the tacos were amazeballs. I got the crunchy taco one beef one chicken and they were so good. The bartenders were super cool too. It was a cool vibe and fun spot out on a Tuesday night. We will definitely be back another Tuesday and maybe another day as well.",

The food is awesome and loco patron is always the first thing we want when we land in Phoenix. If you're looking for some good food & a cute place loco patron is perfect! Their pinto beans and rice is my favorite side here! Definitely stop by if you're in the area!",

I met some friends here for Sunday Funday and we made sure tacos and margs where a big part of our outing. Our favorite taco tasted was the crunchy pork taco. It won the best crunchy taco at the Arizona Taco Festival in 2014. Their chips are okay but I do like their salsa.  We also had the carne asada street tacos but we where not impressed at all. Just didn't have that street cart flavor! Lastly, we tried their carne asada fries. It was good, but not deliciously good. I will still come back because I like their patio and people watching!",

On Tuesday they have deals that you cant beat however while ordering from their discounted menu for taco Tuesday and drink menu I was called \"cheap\" by their bar manager lance. My opinion of lance is that he's a good guy and professional to the eye but character is also about what you're doing when people aren't looking. He actually even made it a point to tell someone in my party that he'd love to get her a drink, however he MUST take a shot first, no question who's tab this shot was on as he pours tequila for girls and himself in a styrofoam cup. Lance May have thought this was all in good spirit but he was quite offensive.... maybe it was the tequila he was drinking with patrons. Still left him a nice tip as he isn't always so arrogant.

Being from Southern California and now living in AZ I've had my share of orgasmic/ fantastic margaritas, so to come here and have the first page of the drink menu be all about margaritas I was really expecting good margaritas. They were both bland and I could hardly tell if alcohol had even made it into the glass. I don't like my alcohol overpowering but I like to know it's at least in my $9-$12 drink!   However...  The saving grace is the salt and pepper wings!!! The habanero wings are great as well!!!   In short, I'd go back for the wings but skip the drinks unless I grab a beer!",

    "text": "Bad. The overall experience was mediocre at first, disappointing in the end. First of all, when you get in, no one greets you. \"Do I seat myself anywhere? Yes.\" So I first sat on the patio waiting for my boyfriend, then we moved to the bar. The blonde bartender is mostly why I have to give one star to this place. No smile, no enthusiasm. Way too many tattoos to display. Her shorts were the classic night-club type. Her cleavage showed too much. I understand it's a casual place, but during the day that's not what employees should wear, in my opinion. It took awhile before she asked for drinks and she didn't even come back to take the food order. The manager took our order. My boyfriend wanted some sweetener for his iced tea and he asked for some sugar or simple syrup. Now I used to be a bartender too so I know you guys have simple syrup. But apparently cordiality is something she doesn't know about. A first bad impression, don't you think?  Food: I'm not a connoisseur of the Mexican cuisine nor a big fan on it, but my beef enchiladas were not good. The chili sauce was too spicy and had no flavor. My boyfriend, who knows better Mexican food, agreed with me. His tacos were good though. Even the dessert we had, I don't remember the name of it, perhaps sopaipillas, was good for me cause it was the first time I had it. But again, my partner didn't find it good at all. Cleanliness of the place was another turn down. The chairs were dirty, the salt and pepper all greasy. Who knows how many people with dirty hands have touched those salt and pepper before us.   Concluding we won't come back. You people should learn what good customer service with a professional appearance is like.",

We were sweating while waiting to order. It was dark, hot and sticky. The tables were filthy. And our waitress was less than attentive. Another waitress handed us two dirty plates and I was horrified that she missed all the crusted food that decorated the plate. We had to personally ask for chip and salsa, which the salsa was sitting on the kitchen bar for what appeared to be hours.... another concern. When we finally got our food it was less than impressive. Looked like something you could grab from a local fast food joint. The chicken was processed and didn't have any type of seasoning. It was just chunks of processed deli meat that decorated the plate. This was such a horrific experience and we had really high hopes for this joint. It has potential but really really needs some help.",

I was with a party of five... sitting at a long rectangle table.  The waitress brought one basket of chips & one cup of salsa.  Given the set up of the table, we all couldn't even reach the chips & salsa! When we asked for more the waitress was nice, but clueless to figure out that more than one was needed to start with!  Someone in our party ordered a single taco. Meet & cheese.  Nothing more.  She got meet & avocado with cheese on top.  The waitress was confused as to why that was wrong.   So to review... great food, delicious.  Subpar service ... just a clueless girl.  We had to ask to order drinks, she didn't ask, she did not understand large parties, rectangular tables & adequate chips & salsa & a simple taco order stumped her.   For tourists you'll be fine... they aren't repeat customers, but for locals like me, the service is an issue.",

They have food runners bring out the food so it's always a food auction. But, for dollar tacos, who can complain? The salsa is on the watery side, but it definitely has good flavor and doesn't stop me from eating it. It's nice that it's complimentary as well.   I don't get here as often anymore because we moved from old town, but we still make the drive sometimes for taco Tuesday!",

A group of 3 guys graciously let us share their table since the place was packed.  A short period later one of the guys pours his drink into the candle holder and storms off.  I made a comment about it being his time of the month and I'm not so sure they appreciated it because they all left.  Although, the most sober of the bunch seemed embarrassed.  Whatever, free table, woohoo!  Next table starts having a beer fight.  I'm not kidding.    I then started feeling really old.  And overdressed.  An employee comes by to clean up the empty bottles from my table and notices the candle holder full of liquid.  I told him about the guy with PMDD.  He made a little joke about the the guy being upset over my rejection of him.    Final analysis- Patron has some cool employees and some not so cool customers.",

The place was empty on a Monday afternoon so had the place to ourselves and the TVs. Nice enough setting for a late lunch. We each ordered a margarita off the regular menu to try something different. The spicy mango margarita and the prickly pear margarita we both good but at full price neither of us wanted another. My husband ordered wings and street tacos off the HH menu, He is a wing man and said they were ok, nothing special. He tried a few different street tacos and had to doctor them to create more flavor.I ordered the Ahi salad. Everything in the salad was fresh just no flavor, too bad because it looked yummy. 2 drinks, a salad off regular menu and 3 street tacos, and 1 order of wings for $60.00 (before tip) seemed a bit high to us.",

They also have a full menu and I would highly recommend the Carne Asada. It's like $15 and comes with a bunch of sides and all of the fixings in case you want to make tacos. I normally just eat it like steak with sides but I have used everything you get to make tacos and it's the bomb!   On top of the great food the drinks are good, I mean drinks are drinks anywhere but they have good prices and they are not weak.   The service here is what really sets it apart from the rest of the bars in Old Town. I used to visit this bar on occasion when I lived in L.A. like 6-7 years ago and they still have a ton of the same people. It's great and they are so friendly.   If anywhere in Old Town deserves 5 stars it is Loco Patron! -AJD",

Second, when I am bombed, for some reason I am totally drawn to their nachos.  They are the bestest thing ever when I've had a few too many and I will leave other bars to go to Loco just to nosh on them.  Other than that, the service is generally fine but can be spotty, the crowd is a little too douchey for me some days, but it's all A-OK in my book.  You will likely have a pretty good time there!",

Kind of a divey bar feel. *Allow you to smoke on the patio, which is disgusting YUCK! I always have someone that has their cigarette pointed away from them (to me) or holding behind them (to me). Hey its your cigarette you smell it right? It seems weird, because the patio is partially covered with the bar and Arizona law is 20 ft. from the building. I don't understand how they allow people to smoke at the bar or so close to it, when you 10 feet to the other side of the bar inside. *No parking assigned to Loco Patron! Do NOT park in the flag store parking or near, you will get towed. Heard horror stories on people trying to get your car back. Park on the road or try and find a spot in the garage. Its tough when its nice out and people are in old town or anything is going on. Prepare to look a while. BUT when its nice out, who cares, its good exercise and walk off those carbs ;) *You always get the drunkest and loudest people there haha! Its like people from all over kicked out go to Loco and they let them in! The music is blasting as well, which is fun most of the time.  Faves on menu-  App on happy hour-Cheese Crisp $3.00 Marinated Grilled Chicken Salad- $9.00  and of course Chips and Salsa = Free!   All in all its worth it to give it a shot.

Between 4 people for an entree and drink our bill was $95. They should pay us to eat and drink this crap!",

    "text": "I want to give this place two stars. It deserves two stars, HOWEVER, I have decided on 3 for the sheer fact of the sale of cheap tacos and cheap beer.   I will be first to say that I strongly dislike the semi-douchey scene of Loco Patron, but what can one expect when they're in an OTSCO bar that is frequented by barely legal drinkers? So I set my thirty year old snobbery aside and went for some cheap tacos. When I walked in to what I thought was a restaurant, I was carded! WTF? There was a 7 year old kid munching on his taco, watching my carding go down. We locked eyes for a moment while the bouncer flashed his light on my ID, I think the child was mocking me. I was wondering why he was allowed in. Oh well.   After that puzzling moment, I met the gang. While the conversation at the table was rousing, I couldn't help but notice the coke-ho dancing without any rhythm or to the music that was in her head at the bar in front of us. She was really working it too! I tore my eyes away from the train wreck to peruse the simple menu. I ordered off of the regular menu to get some shrimp tacos. They were pretty flavorful! I was rather surprised. I also ordered a steak taco off of the \"Taco Tuesday\" menu to try. Again, another pretty good, flavorful taco! The rice and beans were just alright. Nothing too amazing.   I guess my overall impression is that Loco Patron is a great place to meet some friends if you're broke on a Tuesday and you're hungry and want a beer or two! I wouldn't rush back to visit this joint, but it would do in a pinch.",

This is what I expect most of the douchenozzles and their accompanying dirty vagina'ed amigas have on an endless, thousand-decibel-loop inside their pea-brains as they lean like euro-cholos here at Loco Patron, never really acknowledging each other until the battle call \"JAGERSHOTS JAGERSHOTS JAGERSHOTS\" , is signaled to the witless congregation, first as a question, then as an affirming statement, and finally a rallying yell, like a slow-clap-progression in a John Hughes movie.  If this is you, take your hand and slap some sense into yourself ... you are annoying the piss out of me as I stand there drinking my shitty beer in a crappy version of Mexican Chili's.

When the restaurant ran the charge thru my bank they rounded up and claimed it was an error because my writing was hard to read.  I'll admit the up charge was only .72 cents but It's my money not yours,  the manager didn't seem to get that.  After a week manager finally called back but you could tell she was bothered by the whole issue.  2 stars for the waitress.",

    "text": "This place is disgusting. I would have lived a long happy life not having entered Loco Patron. The crowd is creepy alcoholics, douchey jock stereotypes, frat boys and sad, hysterical hos. The inside is so dark you can barely see the person opposite you and the tone of the place is set when you arrive for dinner at 7PM and are CARDED.   So why on earth am I giving this place 3 stars? Well it's really 2.5 but honestly the food was solid, middle of the road tex mex and the portions were large for their price, making the meal I had a value. The $6.50 quesadilla with green chilies was made with what can only be described as the world's largest tortilla. It had to be a 30\" one because it was folded over and still looked enormous. There wasn't too much cheese in it, but enough to not feel stingy, though the accompanying guac and pico de gallo was not nearly enough for the magnitude of that quesadilla. We were in on a Tuesday night which is $1/$2 taco night and I did try the mahi mahi taco on the soft corn tortilla and liked it. I don't really like mahi mahi because it's regularly cooked to death and tastes like nothing, but the topping made it a nice $2 treat.   If someone brought this food to your house and served it to you without telling you where it was from you would enjoy it. But Loco Patron is a charmless restaurant/bar that should be avoided.",

    "text": "I never thought I would find myself saying this, but I'm a fan of Loco Patron.  For some reason, and not to discredit Fred M., every time I've stopped by this place has been jammed.  It's especially great during spring training, as everyone's looking for an ice cold margarita to cool down after paying $8 for beers at the Giants stadium.  Service is usually pretty quick, even when the bar is packed.  That can be really tough to do and so few bars do it well.  The only downside is having a tough time finding a place to sit.  In fact, I'm not sure that I've ever even taken a seat in this bar.  My 'glass is half full' side tells me that at least you get to work the legs out a bit.  I've never eaten here so I can't comment on the food.  I often forget that people are even there to eat until I'm stumbling past their tables on the way to another bar.  Maybe some day I'll relax and grab a bite here to comment on that aspect.",

Anyway, on to the food/drinks/experience.  TACO TUESDAY is awesome.  $2 tacos, $2 beers.  Does it get any more simple and easy than that?  I really enjoyed the tacos, as well.  The atmosphere sucks unless you love the faux Mexican beach chic theme-restaurant thing they have going there.  I didn't love the music.  It was pretty deserted, which surprised me.  Seems to me such a terrific deal should really draw people in, but apparently that's not the case, or at least it wasn't last night around 8 or so.    I'll go back for the food whenever I get stuck missing ASU again.",

How can you not when there are $1/$2 tacos, $4 nachos, and $2 Dos Lager on draft?!   I had the Mahi Mahi tacos on corn tortillas, which were $2. Plus 6ish Dos Equis. All for $35 including tip. Not too bad I thought. Our server was a little on the slow side, but we were having a good time and didn't mind too much. I tried the nachos and they were decent and for $4 nicely sized. We were sitting on the patio on a great early evening/night. Normally Tuesday nights are reserved for hockey, but being in between seasons a little HH was just what the doctor ordered. This night turned into an adventure with a drunken trip to the Grapevine. Solid!",

    "text": "Usually at least somewhat busy - this bar has a few things going for it... For one, it's got a great location - although it's a little close to competitor Salty Senorita. Second, it's got chips and salsa and standard mexi food and the kitchen is \"open late\" (whatever that means). The food isn't so bad - it gets the job done... but I don't know that I'd suggest it for a sit-down meal. Maybe it's good if you're planning on making it a long night and you want to get some food to keep you going. I don't know...   The layout of Loco is fairly comfortable and casual - although when it's crowded, it gets difficult to navigate around the small bar to get a drink. When you do get a drink, they aren't weak or terribly expensive. The problem with this bar is that it's a douche-fest. Looking around the room on any given weekend night, you can just go \"douche, douche, douche, plastic, douche, plastic, douche...\" and you'll know there's probably $8000 worth of fancy jeans in room. It's a slightly different crowd from Salty's I think. There are a lot of good looking people there usually, but it's just not my crowd. Maybe I'm getting too old.",
