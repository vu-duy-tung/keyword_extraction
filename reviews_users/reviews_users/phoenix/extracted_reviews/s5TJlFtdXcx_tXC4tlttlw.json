I like a little spiciness with my thai dishes, but the levels (low, medium, and high) all vary!  Thankfully, the medium spiciness here, was aligned with what I considered medium :)  Thai Panang:   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s5TJlFtdXcx_tXC4tlttlw?select=jf6GntlWc0n8L__ehq8ROg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/s5TJ...</a> .  But this was my favorite dish, the curry was so rich with flavor and had a nice kick to it.   Up until this point, Thai Spices locked in a 4 star rating, until I ordered a side of sticky rice ($2) to eat with the rest of my curry.  I wish I took a picture, but the rice was served in a little bamboo container, and when I lifted the lid, there was rice wrapped in plastic wrap.    WTH is this?!  $2 for rice that's barely half my palm size, AND it was served in plastic food wrap!  0_o",

It's sweet, rich, and creamy, and the vegetables are cooked perfectly, meaning they're not mushy but they're easy to cut into bite-sized pieces.  On the Happy Hour menu they have Buddha Gyoza, which I'd never heard of before. I was super excited when the server said it's a tofu dumpling (potsticker). I don't eat meat, and it's tough to find non-meat-based dumplings. They use some kind of textured soy crumble, so the filling looks similar to ground pork, but they're vegetarian-friendly. They were awesome.  My husband got the Seafood Pad Cha and loved it as well. There are a bunch of other non-meat items on the menu I want to try -- it's just so hard not to get the Pumpkin Tofu Curry that I love so much.   The service was excellent. Everyone was very friendly and this must be a place for regulars because our server greeted almost everyone at the door like an old friend.",

Ok then, I'll order togo 20mins prior to pick up, was told that it would take 15mins for all 3 orders.   25mins later, I showed up and still nothing was ready. Had to wait extra 15 mins for an order of salad.  I wouldn't come here if my wife doesn't really like this place. In fact, she keeps indicating that the food here is awesome and I found the contradict.  Anyways, I ordered 1 pad see ew, which comes as a big failure: no veggie as stated on the menu. Yeah, only noodles and some shrimps (look so naked eh) - less veggie and more paper. Why do I say that? Found a paper sticker of something (must be from one of the products) and I chew it off accidentally. Luckily I did not swallow it.  The crab papaya salad, oh yeah, the crabs taste so salty, not as tasty as I usually get. I didn't even recognize how much the difference of dining in and taking out until now. Basically, you pay same prices for food items, but take-out orders have much less quality.   What a shame! I'll try to convince my wife for a new Thai spot, without having to drive too far from Gilbert to Mesa.",

    "text": "One word that describes Thai Spices is \"meh\".    Located in MeKong Plaza, it took over the old BoCa 7 space.  When walking in the place, you'll notice its nice decor.  alas, it was left behind by the previous tenant (yes that is real gold wall paper fyi).  The place was quiet for a Friday night and we came there for my bday.  Apparently happy hour is extended till 7:30pm but its not stated or noted anywhere.  Since we had a big party, we ordered a multiple of their appetizers.  The most notable ones are surprisingly not thai related.  The crab puffs were very unique and good as well as the calamari rings.  Who would of thought the secret sause (thousand island) would make a diffrence.  After that, everything pretty much went down hill from there.  The thai dishes were not very good.  We had the pad thai, a little on the sweet side, plus the portions are a little small.  Also the green curry was salty, i have a very salty palate, but even this was more than my liking.  But it was good though, good with rice that is.  Also even though we got it \"mild\" it still had a healthy kick of spices.  The Thai fried rice was also mediocre and a lil on the oily side.  The Tom Yum soup was good.  Again nothing special but atleast it didnt taste off.  Again this was a lil on the salty side too.  The only notable dish that we had was the Papaiya salad with salted crab.  That has a unique after taste.    So in review, if you were at MeKong Plaza and had a craving for Thai food, then lucky you.  But its not a place you'd actually actively seek out if you werent literally already there.    Pros: -happy hour specials daily 4 to 7:30Pm (supposedly) -great happy hour specials that are actually delish! - great decor hahahha  Cons: - food is sub par - thai specialties are sub par - thai tea wasnt a home run. - prices are not reflective of the quality and quantity.",

The restaurant atmosphere is very laid back and calm. It is somewhere where one wants to be and feels comfortable being there. Not only does Thai Spices offer a soothing environment but also a variety of mouth-watering menu items.  The menu has a large range of foods to choose from, the appetizers, entrees, desserts, including the drinks are all unique. As for myself, the Thai tea was one of my favorite items to order. It is refreshing and leaves my taste buds wanting more. My other family members prefer the fried calamari appetizer which is fried to a crisp and is served with a perfect sauce to compliment the taste.  Going to Thai Spices as a first timer will most definitely include anything but disappointment. The food is authentic and is made fresh. Thai delicacy is hard to find in Arizona with so many few Thai restaurants but Thai Spices is #1 on my list of places to go whenever me and my family are feeling hungry. The restaurant stays clean and delicious all year round, with great service as well.",

I absolutely love Thai food, but unfortunately have only found a couple Thai restaurants out of MANY here in the valley I would consider authentic and really good! I was pleasantly surprised to stumble on Thai Spices! The warm atmosphere is inviting for lunch or dinner, perfect for just walking in or for a planned date. I can't say enough about Anna and Loc as they are always friendly, attentive, and amazing! They make you feel as if you're a guest eating a meal at their home. It's a rare thing these days, and they never fail to put a smile on my face. The food is exceptional, from traditional dishes to more mainstream, you will be extremely impressed with the quality of any dish you choose. It's difficult to make a specific recommendation because EVERYTHING is wonderful! If you really want great value and fantastic Thai cuisine, I highly recommend Thai Spices!",

I had the classic chicken pad thai (hot) no tofu and it was very good. great portions too, and very affordable. The restaurant is good looking as well, and the waiters are friendly. I would highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "Amazing Place. Excellent service. Starting with the Veggie Spring Rolls which were good, but the accompanying sauce that just gave a suggestion that it was sweet and sour pulled the whole starter to the next level. For dinner we ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and the Pineapple Rice (both medium hot which proved to be just right). The Pad Thai was authentically delicious and the Pineapple Rice unexpectedly surprised with a few big shrimps, chicken, and tofu, but nevertheless, was uniquely tasty. The Pumpkin curry on the $5 menu is a must order. We also enjoyed sticky rice with fresh ripe mango and a not too sweet milk. The whole experience was perfect. Nicely decorated modern atmosphere with an obvious Thai theme. Clean restaurant and bathroom. What more could you ask for. We will definitely be going back for more! In the buzz and influence of a belly fully satisfied with wonderful Thai food, my husband even declared Thai food as his new favorite cuisine!",

I got the Rama's Chicken, my girlfriend got the Tom Kha Noodle Soup and my friend got the Chicken Chow fun. Thai hot is the way to go for the Rama's but tends to be way spicier in other dishes. We were all satisfied with our food and were more than excited for the leftovers. I definitely recommend this place to all lovers of great thai food.",

    "text": "Let me first say that this thai restaurant was definitely something that came as a surprise. As I was looking for a fulfilling meal on a friday night after work this definitely did the trick. The two ladies that work the front of the restaurant are super nice and helpful. I had the red curry with tofu and returned 2 days later for more, so yes it was just that good. I got the mild flavor which had a bite but the medium would also be a choice. I love how they make the curry overall it seems like it takes much preparation and doesn't consist just of a powdered curry. Overall, very clean doesn't smell like those weird restaurants that you aren't sure what comes out of the back and definitely reminds me of back home in Los Angeles. If you have time you should definitely check on the marketplace next door, it is quite the cultural experience with some exciting treats. I will definitely be back and will be trying their pad thai.",

It had four or five shrimp and I really liked that there were plenty of veggies in it too (cabbage, onion, carrot, broccoli). The eggplant stir fry had a nice kick to it at medium spicy and the chicken was tender. I would get takeout here again for sure. My only complaint is that they didn't include any utensils or napkins, but I didn't think to ask either.",

We got their around 8:45pm and the place was sort of emptied out, but it was perfect for us. I also noticed that I got a free Thai Tea for checking in on Yelp! How sweet is that!    For starters we ordered the chicken satay, the chicken was delish and full of flavors, the peanut sauce was amazing! My son and I at the same time said we could bath in the peanut sauce it was that good! Apple doesn't fall far from the tree I guess. But that sauce is amazing! Love it!   One ordered the Massaman Curry, mild and that dish looked so very yummy! He said it was delish too! The other one ordered the Chicken Pad Thai mild without bean sprouts and he loved it too!  I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai as well, but had my Thai hot baby, bring on the heat I say! I enjoyed the Pad Thai, the noodles where perfectly cooked, the chicken was very tender and so tasty! The pad Thai did come with tofu, which next time I know to have it without tofu but since it was already on my plate I went ahead and tried it out, and well it was flavorless and blubbery, like you would imagine a whale to be. It's not my thing, but I tried :) .  My son and I have a favorite little Thai place on the other end of Mesa that we love, but I think Thai Spices just might have knocked them out, can't wait to come back and try the pineapple fried rice of course with chicken!",

I can't complain that much since they gave us 2 free Thai iced teas for checking into Facebook. I asked them to make it really spicy and they did! I got the red curry tofu and it was great, just small for the dinner price. Maybe I'll try this place out again during lunch cause that portion would be fine if it was with a lunch special. I didn't notice on the menu that my dish came with mushrooms so I found myself picking them out of my plate. The server (Lan) was nice and served us water as soon as we needed more. I'd give it 5 stars if the portions were more reasonable for the price until then it'll be a 4 and maybe even a 3 in the future.  The free Thai iced teas got them an extra star on this first visit. I liked that they were playing Christmas music during our whole visit and had the NBA basketball game playing on the television. They seemed to have a good selection of beers and liquor so we'll definitely have to come back during happy hour next time",

As I waited patiently for the waitress to come back to take my order, she was able to seat three parties that walked in after me, print a check, take it to the appropriate table AND stop at another table to take their order. When she came back, I realized that the wait for food might be longer than expected so I chose to sit at the bar to order an appetizer and drink. The bartender continuously looked at me while doing something else but never initiated contact. I even attempted to wave her over to signal that I needed assistance. After sitting there for five additional minutes, I left. I am not the type to leave negative reviews but this is outrageous. On top of the fact that my prior experiences were subpar at least.",

At first glance, this is in the same shopping plaza as a few other places that I really enjoy (the Com Tam place and the Snow place are in the same complex) and I figured it would look similar to them inside, and it was really nice inside in my opinion! Very large and spread out. You can tell that they definitely value the cleanliness of the establishment.  I had their pumpkin curry with chicken, medium heat, as I asked if spicy was in fact...super spicy? And the waitress implied that the hot would be tongue numbing. The flavors were really good, and yes, when in doubt, order lower for the heat! It was really delicious. My date got the Pad Thai (also medium) and I kept stealing his, it was that good.  Also, their thai tea had a cute little flower in the straw that I forgot to take a picture of, but I was obsessed!   Will definitely come back :)",

The green curry taste the same as the red curry... Maybe a little more red pepper in the red curry. The customer service was slow and rude even though there were only four other patrons in the restaurant. I would pass on this restaurant next time.",

They have a $5 menu all day as well, which could be a make it or break it deal to come back. Nice, relaxing place to chill and the service is good.  1) $5 Papaya salad with crab. HECK TO THE NO!!! It was overly salty, fishy smelling/tasting, with old dead crab shells. I thought it'd be at least some imitation crab, but no. It was nasty crab legs soaked in with the vinegar. The papaya was way too sour and salty to enjoy.  2) $5 Chicken and noodles. It sounded just meh, but it was actually really good with lots of chicken (surprisingly) and other veggies like mushrooms, bamboo, onions etc. They gave really little angel hair pasta but the flavor of spices was really good. Decent in terms of legit pasta (rather get it from a Chinese restaurant).  3) **GREEN CURRY. The curry was really good here. It was the right balance of sweet and salty. They gave lots of veggies and meat in their curry as well. We ordered beef, which unfortunately was a little chewy.  All in all, a decent meal...great when you are starving and craving something with flavor.  Thai only spiced me up to 3 stars.",

We had the beef noodles, with generous chunks of beef and beef meatballs in a dark rich broth.  They are called boat noodles because, traditionally, this type of noodle was served on the river from a seller in a boat.  In Bangkok, these are usually very small bowls.  Here, they are American sized and a bowl is a good lunch or a light meal.  A simple thing, done perfectly.  And at five bucks, quite the bargain.  We'll go back for dinner some other time.

    "text": "This place is discrimination about Asian honestly. My bf & I were here for lunch and we were the only Asians at this time. There are 6 tables of American guests. The place wasn't busy at all. There are two waitresses. The waitress offered EVERY tables a soup to start off right when they sat down but not for me and my bf. I mean ALL THE TABLES just not mine. I didn't even bother to ask for it because I don't think that is necessary. Ok next, so the waitress went straight to tell us to order the food. So we did. We ordered 4 dishes for two of us. There was no bowls or plates for us even when the foods come out. We had to ask for it. They don't even bother to fill my bf and my water when it visible empty. I had to sat there to wait for them and ask for a to go box. And they don't even bother to come and ask if i need anything. BUT they waitress did asked the table next to mine and offered them services. I don't normally write review even if the place is very good or very bad. I only do verbal referral to ppl and friends to the places i like and I don't like. But at this place i felt VERY not welcome. They serve others better than their own race. I won't be back again. This is my first time and also my last time for this place. I don't mind if the foods are good or bad but reputation is important to me. Thanks to any viewers that read my post.",

    "text": "This was my second Thai resturaunt in as many days.  I went with a friend who has eaten at several Thai places so I am basing a lot of this review off of his comments.  Personannly I thought the food was very good.  It had a rich,deep flavor that was very pleasing.  One thing that I have noticed is that the food is not as hot as I expected.  We ordered the Tom Ka soup with chicken.  Overall it was very good.  It comes in this neat serving vessel that has flames shooting out of the center of it.  Two things that were disappointing about this soup:  1)  I know that the soup is flavored with lemon grass, however most people will filter out the lemon grass because it is completely inedible.  There were several pieces all thoughout the soup and I was constantly picking them off of my tongue and out of the bowl.  2)  We ordered the soup Double Thai Hot.  Now, when I hear the words \"Double\" and \"Hot\" in the same sentence and they are descirbing a food I tend to get excited.  I must also admit that my tolerance to hot food is somewhat above the Bell Curve, but this produced very little heat.   For entrees my friend ordered the Yellow Curry and the Pad Thai (yes he ordered two entrees so he could take some home).  Both were very good and had a deep rich color and flavor.  I had the Pad Kee Mow with beef.  I will admit that the beef was a little tough and rubbery, but over all the dishes were good.  As I stated before, the food was not as hot as I thought and the wait staff talked me down a few notches on the heat scale.  Next time I will stick to my guns and get it HOT!  My friend gave the soup a 10 out of 10 and the entrees an 8 out of ten.",

I ordered the pad kee mow, which was noodles and veggies... it was good, but I ordered it medium spicy, and it wasn't spicy at all. I really liked the spring roll, it had corn in it, which was kind of different and cool. So overall, it is a good deal, but I have had better thai food....

Thai Spices serves Americanized food, not authentic Thai, despite the menu descriptions that the food is indeed so. Way too much sugar in the dishes to please American palettes.

The Pad Thai is very good, but their BBQ Pork is SPECIAL!!!! I get their lunch combo with Pad Thai, BBQ Pork, spring roll, rice and soup for $11.50 and it is a steal. That BBQ Pork is just amazingly delicious. I can't speak highly enough of it.   I've also tried their spring rolls, coconut shrimp and crab puff appetizers. All are very good.

Veggie Rolls - D E L I C O U S, it came out piping hot and crispy!   Soup - this soup was on the sweet side and came with one piece of thin sliced chicken.   New Zealand Mussels - it came in a fancy little pot, which was cute. It has great taste, not dry at all and as a bonus it came with a side of sweet chili sauce for dipping.  Yellow Curry with Chicken - it had a very rich tasty flavor. The carrots and potatoes we very tender, which I LOVE!   Seafood Pad See Ew - the crispy fried fish was sooooo good! I think that was the best thing on the plate!   Chicken Pad Thai - it was okay, I've had better.   Customer Service was GREAT! Water was always filled and the waitresses were very attentive.   The only thing I was confused about was that when you check-in on yelp, they offer a free Thai Tea, but when I showed them the check in, I was informed that that offer is no longer valid!! I was sooo confused as to why the offer is there when you check in. The waitress however honored it and advised this would be the only time they would offer the free Thai Tea.   Overall, great experience and quick service!",

So many good things to say about them, wish I could give five stars, but unfortunately, their curries are severely lacking. Panang was lacking in flavor and very disappointing.    Thom ka Gai is good. But could even be better if they added lemon grass and galangal.",

The Pad Kee Mow had zero sauce on it. It was dry noodles with pepper, chilis and vegetables.  The appetizer platter had cold cream cheese crab rangoons, cold spring rolls, cold sweet potato \"fries\", with warm chicken skewers. The chicken wasn't bad and the rest crumbled as you bit into it.   The pineapple fried rice and Lad Na were the only two items that were edible. I'm sure I could have made due with the other items but after spending $60 and driving 20 minutes to pick it, I shouldn't have to.  Disappointing. Very disappointing.",

It was my first time trying yellow curry I didn't know what to expect but if definitely met my expectations. I bought the lunch combo which included the shrimp curry , steamed rice and a small egg roll.   The curry sauce was delicious, I mixed my rice with my curry and i fell in love, and the egg roll was good along with the sauce they provide for the roll ... but the only item I didn't care for was the shrimp. I only got 3 medium sized shrimp on my curry and the rest was veggies . I wish there was more shrimp on my plate, but for the price I can't really complain it was less than 10$.   Will I go back? Maybe..",

The service wasn't amazing. The servers were constantly on their phones which was off putting cause my boyfriend had a question about something and as he was asking, she just walked away and went back to her phone.

What really impressed me is their papaya salad which is delicately chopped (great knife skills is a must so the sauce will mix evenly in your mouth) seasoned with lime juice and raw lime peel which is finely done.  Their Coconut broth Chicken Soup with lemongrass is also heavenly and spiced properly even with a western pallet.  The Riverboat soup is good but the beef is a little tough but the base of the soup is excellent and well seasoned-little on the salty side.  Too bad they didn't have fresh sugarcane juice but settled for Thai coffee instead and all are great.  All for $5 each so the bill was in mid $20 and we had a great time.",

OH! and the weird bill fiasco.... apparently their computer system isn't able to total and then take a discount off, so the owner ended up taking off like... $18 instead of $20, as our coupon stated, because taxes weren't included? no matter how many times i did the math, it didn't make sense. we ended up waiting a long time because the waitress had to call the owner...  long story short, we got our $20 off, as stated on the LS deal. left a bad taste in my mouth.  i would go back if i was really craving their curry... but chances are, i'll just figure out how to make it myself at home.",

    "text": "If you love thai food (especially curry and pad thai), I highly suggest you try Thai Spices.  I'm new to the Mesa/Tempe area, and have been relying on Yelp to find places to try. I wouldn't normally bother reviewing a place with already decent ratings, but It was too good to not say good things. My boyfriend and I shared the crab puffs, shrimp and crab pad thai, and shrimp yellow curry. Medium was the perfect level of spiciness for both of us.   The yellow curry is thick, with a lot of vegetables, as opposed to many places that have watery curry with just a couple of veggies. It has a ton of flavor, but was not overwhelming.  The pad thai is some of the best I've had, beaten only by a place too expensive to be worth it. Even though I ordered the shrimp and crab, they included some tofu in it, which I thought was great. For those of you who don't like bean sprouts, they come on the side. The sauce they cook the pad thai in is delicious. At first I was hesitant to not order a side of peanut sauce (I love a lot of peanut sauce on pad thai), I'm glad I didn't...it would have been completely unnecessary. They were very friendly when I went in, and knew that I hadn't been there before. We ordered take-out, so I'm not sure what the service is like if you sit down to eat.  They have a stamp card where, after 9 stamps, you get a free lunch special. You get a stamp very every lunch special you order, or every $10 you spend on dinner.  I thought the prices sounded great before getting the food, but thought they were even better once I saw how much food you get. I still have enough pad thai to feed me for at least 2 more large meals, and my boyfriend has at least enough curry and rice for one more good-sized meal. And for $5.95, you get 6 good sized and delicious crab puffs.  I will definitely be returning!!!",

Granted I'm not a connoisseur or a frequent eater of Thai food, I do like this place. The food is quite yummy, it has yumminess, but it won't have you craving it.  The presentation is truly beautiful.  One other thing my family and friends really like about this place is the humongous servings.  None of us, could clear the table.  Usually I can eat my portion, my neighbors and help one more person, but I could barely finish my own; the extra spicy that I ordered helped me eat all my rice though :). I think of one my favorite things about this place is also the friendly service.  Of the three visits, the service has always been courteous, smiling, and very friendly/helpful. I would suggest this place if you happen to be in the neighborhood or within 10 minutes driving. What I had the last time I was there: Green Curry Chicken Curry Some Kind of Noodle dish :)",

Thai Spices completely won us over with their delicious and fresh food and incredible service. Anna was our server and was helpful and friendly.   My only complaint is that they don't have Pad Prik King on the menu which is my favorite Thai dish.   We had the chicken satay appetizer, Pad See Ew and BBQ pork all of which were served with huge portions and were really good! We had enough leftovers between us for another full meal.   Glad to have found our new Thai place!",

I went from a 3 to 4 and was very pleased in heat. Yes I broke a sweat with that one. He welcomed us to become regulars. I love the way dishes are welcomed to be customized. We will be back!",

The Thai tea was delivered promptly, was tasty and had a nice touch of a flower from the straw wrapper, served in a tall glass. However the glass is not large and they don't offer one refill on the tea, which is $4, so I was disappointed. The Laab was a nice portion, but without any lettuce or cabbage, and was very, very tasty. But I ordered it for the rest of the 'salad', as the dressing/sauce is so yummy, and there was none. So I requested some additional lettuce, for which I was charged $1. I personally think this should have already been a part of the dish, and was once again disappointed.  Overall, the food was quite tasty, but I probably won't return as the value wasn't there, and there are many other Thai restaurants I need to try.",

The last time I came here was a Saturday night after I got off work. 6 of us came in but 2 of my friends left shortly after that, before we ordered. We saw the promotion for free Thai tea if we check in on Facebook so we did that. 3 of us checked in and showed our server, the very thin lady, but she denied because she didn't know how to check in on Facebook (???) What's the point of giving the promotion but not knowing how that works? She seemed like she didn't want to give us the tea. We ordered an appetizer and main entrees but never got our appetizer. When she brought our dishes out, we asked about the appetizer but she argued with us and blamed us for not ordering that. When my friend paid at the front, we were charged 18% gratuity even though there were only 4 of us (???) He saw the extra charge but he was so tired of arguing with this lady who couldn't distinguish between right and wrong and didn't know how to do her job right (as a server) so he just paid it. When we asked another server about the Thai tea, she happily gave us the tea after checking our Facebook. The thing is that there were 3 check ins but they only gave us 2, so we asked our server about the other tea, she said we already paid so if we want the tea we had to pay for it (????)  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!! I WILL NOT RETURN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The Pad Thai dish that they have could have been a lot better. Their curry dishes are very good though and I would probably come back to have that again. I did order their curry with a request for medium spicy and I probably could have gone one notch down to the mild spicy, that seems to be the case with most Thai restaurants though for me. I have also tried their lemongrass chicken and thought it was just okay, but still would prefer to have that over the Pad Thai.  As they have decent lunch specials here I'll probably come back here every now and then, especially with the restaurant located in Mekong Plaza. I can highly recommend their curry dishes as that was the best of three lunch specials that I tried.",

I've ordered some other items (curry fish? or something) and they are enjoyable but I typically go with the same old same old.  Soup is always tasty. Thai Tea is almost worth the trip on its own. Lunch prices are fair and portions are good. I may be biased because I'm a regular but I'm a regular for a reason. Order the Pad Thai with Chicken and/or the Red Curry with Chicken and you'll know why I go back again and again.",

I tried other places like Thai Basil, Thai Elephant, saBai Modern Thai, Smile Thai, but I always find myself coming back to this spot. Their food is the best seasoned and has the best level of spice.   My favorites are the Mee Krob for a sweet and crunchy start, Yellow Curry with chicken or shrimp for a good classic spice, and the Pad See Ew for a rich savory main course.   The service has always been great, both dining in and taking out, and the full bar makes a good environment for a nicer dinner out. Would highly recommend over other Thai places in the area.",

What I liked was the flavor of the broth, the large chunks of tofu and other vegetables (although I wish there were larger pieces of mushroom).  What I didn't like is that I ordered medium and it was in reality a \"hot\" level.  I also tried the sticky rice and mango.  They give you a LARGE portion, but the sticky rice was not quuuuite to my liking.  Something about the texture was off.  I did not try their curry, but I will note that they use the plastic takeout containers and for the curry it was filled about 2/3 of the way whereas with our usual Thai place they fill it all the way up.  I would eat here again, but I still prefer our usual Thai place better.",

Having been to Thailand and paid no more than $3 for an amazing entree, I get a little disgusted going to places and seeing a curry dish for $13 and another $2 for an order of rice.   I had the green curry and it was off the chain. Definitely one of the better that I've had stateside. The only downside was that there was about just as much sliced ginger as there was other assorted vegetables, but nonetheless it was delicious. I got the lunch special so it was only $7.50 with soup and an egg roll. My wife had the pad Thai and that was also one of the better pad Thai dishes I've had.",

    "text": "Absolutely cannot say enough good things about Thai Spices. My husband was born in Thailand and we wanted an authentic Thai food buffet for our wedding in Phoenix in January. We looked at a few different Thai restaurants that cater and ended up picking Thai Spices. They came through for us with flying colors! In the months leading up to the wedding, we made a point to eat there several times with family and friends to sample different dishes, even though we live out of state. Each time the food was simply delicious, so we weren't concerned about the big day. The only issue was how well the food would transport/reheat but everything was seamless. Punninee and her team worked diligently with the catering staff at our venue to make sure everything was all set and in the end, the food totally stole the show! Our guests (about 100 people) raved about it and at the end of the night, everyone who stayed to help us pack up and take down decorations was jockeying for the leftovers! Everything tasted amazing, especially the cashew chicken, and we actually ran out of papaya salad because it was so popular that people kept going back for seconds! We got so many compliments on the dinner. Plenty of veggie and vegan options too (they were even nice enough to put the fish sauce on the side for our pickier relatives). Appetizers were veggie rolls and chicken satay with peanut sauce, served during cocktail hour. It was everything we wanted and more. SO glad we went with Thai Spices. Can't thank them enough for their incredible catering service! Highly recommend!!!",

It was flavorful and just the right amount of spice (I requested medium). The roaring tiger came out in a sizzling platter. The sizzle and smell was amazing! The beef was marinated well. The Thai boat noodle soup was a large portion, with tender beef, rice noodles, and a lovely tasting broth.   Service was uneven as we had attentive service initially, but then the waiter forgot to refill drinks and check up on us as the meal progressed.   The prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you get. If you're in the Mekong Plaza area this is a tasty option for Thai!",

The Pad Thai is on point and Pad Thai is my way of testing whether or not a Thai restaurant is legit. The BBQ pork is generous size and the veggie roll is crispy. The soup is delicious as well.

The space is kind of dimly lit and has seating in nooks and corners, not a super open space. We ordered the pumpkin curry and ginger binger dishes. The pumpkin curry was excellent, creamy and so yummy. I've never had a Thai pumpkin dish, it was really unique. It tasted like a fusion dish of Thai food and Thanksgiving. I believe this might have been a season dish, not sure. The ginger binger was fresh and had lots of veggies. This tasted more like a typical Thai dish. The only thing that I didn't like was that neither of us were full at the end of the meal which is unusual for Thai food. Usually you get such a huge portion you have enough for leftovers but we both cleaned our plates and were still hungry. Still, the food was really good and the service was great. Just wish it was a little more filling.",

I didn't get that experience here.  That being said the Spicy eggplant was ok, it really was missing flavor. We asked for the heat level to be a 4 out of a 5 rating. The chef was spot on with the level. We also had the BBQ Pork. Can't really mess that dish up.  So in my eyes the chef gets a rating of a 3.  Now the wait staff.  The waitress that waiting on us this afternoon was sweet. We enjoyed her honesty with everything we asked her. The service she gave us was a 5 out of 5. Most Asian restaurant that we've gone to don't come back to the table to check on you and to see how the food is. This young lady did.  So my over all rating is a 4 star.",

It really wasn't medium.  There was a little heat, but not nearly enough to be medium.  Flavor was pretty good, though a bit sweet.  My wife had the fish with a panang sauce (I forget the name on the menu).  It was REALLY good.  The fish had a delicate flavor, and the panang worked with it.  Though, again, it was sweet.  Overall i think \"a-OK\" works.  I can't bring myself to four stars here.  The soup was not great, and the panang shouldn't have been so sweet (I have had a lot of panang over the years, and this is the first time it's ever been sweet).  Service was adequate.  Friendly enough, but only moderately attentive.  No real complaint there, but again not enough to bump me to four stars.",

    "text": "First off, let me preface this by saying that having spent many years living in Thailand, I am a Thai food snob and am ridiculously picky about the Thai restaurants I recommend...   That being said, this is by far the best Thai food in the Phoenix, and surrounding, areas. My first experience was after having a tooth pulled. I needed to eat, but it needed to be soft, and I was craving Thai. So my amazing partner ran over and grabbed me some Pad See Eew and an order of crab  puffs.   The Pad See Eew was the best I've had outside of Bangkok. The flavours were perfectly balanced and it absolutely reminded me of home. They weren't stingy with the protein (chicken) and it didn't seem to be an Americanised version of one of my favourite Thai dishes. And the crab puffs... My partner had a couple and her response to them was, \"These are the best crab puffs i've ever had!\" Not your usual wonton wrapper stuffed with cream cheese with virtually no crab, these are filled with cheesy, crabby, seasoned goodness. So much flavour packed into such a little pouch. And they're served with a sweet chili sauce for dipping.   The second time we ate there, we actually went to the restaurant. It was around 3:30pm on a Saturday so we were pretty much the only people in there. I ordered a Thai iced tea and my partner got a green tea. My Thai iced tea was perfect. Not to sweet, unlike many of the other Thai restaurants I've been to. The green tea was a little strong, and my partner says she's just going to get water from now on. Not because the drinks are bad, but because unlike the majority of restaurants, they serve purified water. Not tap water. MAJOR brownie points there!   We, of course, started out with the crab puffs, which were just as good as the first time. I ordered yellow curry with chicken, and my partner ordered the cashew chicken, both Thai hot. Ordering food \"Thai hot\" can be hit or miss. Many places see the ginger hair and pale skin and figure they can dumb down the Thai hot and I'd never notice. F*ck that! When I say \"Thai hot,\" I mean \"Thai hot!\" And that's exactly what we got.   The cashew chicken was phenomenal. The smell alone brought back to living in Bangkok and eating at the noodle shop across from my school. It was spicy enough to make my nose run and leave that warm, tingly feeling in my mouth and throat but still had incredible flavour. My partner said it was \"amazing.\" (She's not quite the foodie I am, so for her, that's a high compliment.) My curry was pretty damn good, too. Spicy, flavourful, full of large pieces of chicken as well as all the other good stuff (potatoes, carrots, etc). I could smell it as soon as it was set down and I knew it was going to be hot, and I wasn't disappointed. We had enough left over to take home and have for breakfast the next day. The portions are more than generous.  Our server was extremely attentive. Almost overly so, but I was glad for that as opposed to being practically ignored, which can happen when you're the only patrons in a restaurant. He came over at least twice to make sure our food was ok, and always made sure to ask if there was anything else we needed, ie. napkins, more tea, water, etc.   Being so stuffed I didn't get a chance to try their mangoes and sticky rice, but it's on my list since it's one of my favourite foods ever!   The menu is extensive, with all sorts of noodles, stir-frys, curries, etc you can imagine. They have a lunch menu served daily til 3pm (including weekends) that have the same dishes for $6.75, which is what we plan on shooting for next time.   If you like Thai food, this is a must-try!",

    "text": "It hurts to write a 1-star review for this restaurant.  That being said, do not alter a time-honored and familiar recipe.  There is nothing wrong with an addition to the  recipe, as the additions can be requested left out of the order.  However, it is wrong to replace ingredients that make up the basic presentation of the recipe.  This afternoon, I found myself in Mesa for a shopping trip  to Mekong Supermarket.  We have a potluck event coming up at work and I wanted to scope out the place ahead of time for the ingredients I will need.  Seeing the sign for Thai Spices, the trip offered a chance to stop for lunch after I checked out Mekong Supermarket.  On entering the establishment around 1:30 PM, I observed a clean dining room, with a pleasant ambience.  On picking up the 'take it home' version of the menu, I read through and saw what appeared to be suitable offerings for a Thai restaurant.  As always, I looked for Som Tom, green papaya salad, the yardstick by which I measure all  Thai restaurants.  Finding green papaya salad listed, I was gratified.    With no indication whether I should seat myself or wait, I waited.  From entering to being greeted and offered a table, it was about 5 minutes.  There were about 10 people seated in the restaurant, so the wait was, in my perception, reasonable.  When the host came to me, he asked if I would prefer their table menu.  I responded that I found what I wanted, and I would like to be seated.    As I was guided to a table, the host advised I would see my wait person shortly.  He asked what I would like for my beverage and was quick to bring the water with lime I requested.  My waitress arrived shortly after and asked what I would be ordering.  I placed my order for papaya salad, omitting shrimp and long beans, served Thai Hot, along with an order of steamed jasmine rice.  The waitress asked if I could clarify my order, hot being 1-5.  I requested 6.  She wrote down the order and asked if I wanted another beverage in addition to the water.  I declined, and she went to the kitchen, advising I could anticipate a wait of 7-10 minutes for my order.  Sipping water, I waited for my order to arrive.         My order was presented at about 8 minutes.  The salad looked to be reasonable, about 2 cups and the rice about 1 cup.  Som Tom, properly made, should have lime, chile, palm sugar and fish sauce, each of which brings tangy, sweet, salty and spicy notes with the crunch of fresh papaya.    On tasting the salad, I got lime, vinegar , garlic and spicy notes.  The spice was about 5 on a scale of 10 (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes).  I caught the waitress' eye and when she came to the table, she asked if everything was satisfactory.  I told her that the salad was missing some ingredients, specifically fish sauce and palm sugar.  She apologized and took the order back to the kitchen.  3 minutes later, she returned with the same order, though it had been doctored with fish sauce and granulated sugar.  The chef had not remixed or even replated the order, only put fish sauce and granulated sugar on top of the previous order.  I asked the waitress to return this version to the kitchen and requested a new presentation be made, without the vinegar.  She went to the kitchen and returned with the same plate, telling me that the chef would not make a new order.  I asked for the bill, and requested consideration as the order I wanted was not what I anticipated.  The waitress apologized and asked if I wanted to speak with the manager.  In replying that I would, she said the manager would meet me at the register.  I went to the register and on asking for consideration, the manager advised me that the salad was prepared exactly to my order, with no beans and no shrimp.  When I asked why vinegar was used instead of fish sauce, she said \"That is how it is listed in the menu.  Did you not see that?\"  I paid my bill and left.  Oh, I have regrets...yes, I have many regrets.",

Credentials:  I eat a lot of Thai food in San Francisco (hometown, traveling here on biznatch), and have been to Thailand, so y'know, I'm not a noob and I know what authentic tastes like.  My dining companion and I were both thoroughly impressed with Thai Spices.  Dishes:  Tom Ka (with shrimp):  Thicker than any in recent memory, but the flavors were all correct just not quite a delicate and balanced as the very best I've had.  .   but overall quite yum.    Green papaya salad:  Ordered this spicy and it was!  Tingly toungue and blowing my nose, prettymuch just how I like it.  Flavors were not bad, not sure what was slightly off but still, great and the best I've had in Phoenix.  Seafood Pad Cha - Mmmm, this was really good.  Intense, savory, minimal sauce over perfectly cooked seafood.  Nothing was overcooked.    Mango Salmon - My friend got this one, and said it was excellent.    Prices are excellent.  Service was very friendly.    Would def. come again.",

    "text": "Wow. Thank goodness. After a few very disappointing tries, we finally found our Thai place in Phoenix. Everything about our experience here deserved five stars.  Beautiful restaurant - classy decor with dark wood and red glass tile all around the bar area. Certainly not what we expected when headed to a strip mall. Incredibly friendly service throughout the meal between the bartender and server. Nice bathrooms, ample parking, full bar, and TV's at the bar if you want that sort of thing.  Based on Yelp reviews we started with the crab puffs. They are on the happy hour menu - $2 off the order for a total of $4 for six crab puffs. The best we've ever had! SO much delicious filling, and the sauce was great as well. Perfectly fried. Beautiful presentation as well.  For dinner we ordered a small order of Tom Ka soup mild with tofu, and Pad Se-eew medium with fried tofu. These are our two Thai food staples, and we REALLY wanted to like them here.  Whew!! Not only were they good, we agreed that they were among the best we've ever had. The soup seemed very authentic with fantastic flavor and tons of veggies. Exactly what I want every bowl of Tom Ka to be. The Pad Se-eew was drool worthy. PERFECT amount of gravy, incredibly savory, tofu was very tender and not over-fried. The menu said it would include chinese broccoli, and we thought about asking for only regular broccoli since we tend to prefer that, but decided to wait and see how it would turn out. It actually came with a combination of broccoli and chinese broccoli, and both were delicious!   Small criticism that is completely overshadowed by our wonderful dining experience: the only thing that needs to change is their website. The happy hour specials are outdated and according to a sign at the restaurant the hours are about to change as well. Beyond that, we couldn't have been happier with our experience. We were smiling the whole way home! Can't wait to return. Mmmmmm.",

I was the 2nd customer in there, got instantly greeted/seated and went ahead and ordered the Beef Massaman curry at a medium spicy level for $11. Quality was superb, with a really deep, rich flavor and plenty of beef. Any normal person would do well on a classic entree and appetizer combo (apps being slightly discounted from 430-7pm here) to satisfy their hunger...  Having been eating at buffets for dinner and stuffing myself to big-belly status most nights this past week I was conditioned to want at least two more bowls of the stuff ;)  Overall very impressed by this first try, though I have to admit I can get more value elsewhere for my $11+tip!",

The food is top notch, and has actually gotten even better recently as they have refined some of menu items. The atmosphere is very modern, and usually pretty quiet. The staff are all very amiable and helpful whenever we're there.. A great place for lunch and dinner!  The real kicker though is the drink selection. It's the only place in the valley that I know of where you can get Phuket. For those of you who don't know, Phuket is an import beer from Thailand, and easily the best Lager I've ever had. Apart from that wonderful little gem, their speciality drinks (both alcoholic and non) are fantastic as well. Try the Thai Tea, you won't be disappointed!  I highly recommend Thai Spices for anyone looking to enjoy a delicious meal, great drinks, and comfortable atmosphere at a very reasonable price.",

First of all, I have eaten and worked at several Thai restaurants- so I really do appreciate authentic Thai cuisine. I ordered the soup and yellow curry with Tofu.  The soup was more like stew- vegetables lightly covered in a very thick broth, almost like a gravy. I was not a fan of the taste at all- this was some rich stuff. The curry was indeed  tasty, but again- a bit heavy on the coconut- so after about 7 or 8 bites I just couldn't handle it.  Because of my check in, I earned a free Thai tea- which I didn't even bother to take advantage of because of the sheer richness of the meal itself-which I did not finish anyways. Lesson learned for me- WAH WAH.I just wouldn't try it again for the price, not worth the risk.",

I strongly recommend trying something off the Traditional Menu because not only are the dishes different than your typical Arizona washed down Thai restaurant, but because the dishes are under like 6 bucks.  But the real reason John and I keep coming back? Phuket beer. Phuket is very difficult to find in the valley, but Thai Spices is always stocked full of it. There was even a time where they didn't have it for like 3 weeks and John and I expressed our disappointment. Not long after, they restocked and have never been out of stock again (at least every time I've been there since).  4 stars because I still like Thai Basil's food quality more (in Tempe near Tops Liquor).",

    "text": "There are many Thai restaurants in Phoenix metro area.  Thai Spices has our vote as one of the few authentic Thai restaurants.  They have some really authentic Thai dishes, and use the correct ingredients as you find in food in Thailand.  Other Thai restaurants use substitute ingredients in their dishes because it's cheaper.  One example is using cheap broccoli instead of the correct Chinese kale in the stir fry and noodle dishes. Thai Spices always uses the CORRECT traditional Ingredients.  Their service is outstanding, and warm and gentle just as in Thailand. If you really want authentic Thai food, you've come to the right place here.",

I came here with my mom, uncle, and aunt and being my first time, I opted to order my usual pad see ew. We also ordered coconut fried shrimps, the mango papaya salad, tom yum soup, and fried rice. Honestly, the best thing about our order was the coconut fried shrimps. It came out hot a crispy and flavorful. Everything else needed help.   The fried rice was too overwhelming, it tasted like too much fish sauce and was very salty. The Tom yum soup was a little bland and we had to add fish sauce to it, and the pad see ew was way too darn spicy for being a \"mild/medium\". It was full of this unpleasant pepper flavor that I definitely wasn't use to in my pad see ew as well. My aunt and uncle think that the place hired a new head chef or something, because since they're regulars, the food this time around was definitely not worth the bill. We ended up to-going 60% of the food untouched so that we can tweak it ourselves at home to our liking.   All in all, there are other places around town with better food - 1 star. 1star for the friendly staff.",

Here are some of the dishes we've tried: - Chu Chee Fish: great flavorful panang sauce with crisp breading on the fish. However, the sauce will be spicy even if you order it at the \"no spice\" level- speaking from experience. The thickness of the fish has noticeably dropped over the months we've eaten here. - Yellow Curry w/ Chicken: a decent amount of meat with the curry; my only complaint is the lack of rice that comes with the dish",

I thought they were locked and they wanted you to enter from the outside door. Boy did I feel dumb when folks were coming and going from those doors after I made the man walk to the front! We were seated right away and given menus. We waited forever for our drink order,  then eventually she took our food order. They served me before his meal even came out of the kitchen. I'm not a fan of staggered service. So I sat there staring at my food for a few minutes before his arrived. The lunch menu is in effect even on the weekend, which is cool. Cooler, because they are pretty expensive for Thai. J opted for the BBQ pork combo, which came with chicken pad Thai, soup, soda and a fried spring roll. The BBQ pork was a boneless pork chop. It looked nothing like the picture in the menu, and didn't taste like BBQ pork. The pad Thai was mediocre.  The tofu panang was also mediocre. I ordered it mild, but it was still pretty spicy. I ordered brown rice, but still got white. The soup had too many onions and one baby piece of chicken. I also thought it was too sour.  The Thai iced tea was also bland. We weren't offered dessert, which we were contemplating. But boy, it was expensive!  We waited again forever for the bill. The gal kept walking by us, but finally took it. We didn't know if we were supposed to go up or wait for her to take it.  We'll probably pass this place by in the future, with so many other options in the plaza.",

I can't tell if the food is so authentic that the pad thai is like none I've ever had before and I'm not used to it...or if the food is just so mediocre that the pad thai was underwhelming. It was by no means terrible, I just wasn't very impressed. I'm struggling to find words to describe it, but I guess we can start with slightly flavorless and almost sour??? I'm not sure. I was a little disappointed since it had such a rating on here, but I would be willing to give the place another chance with a different dish.  I got the pad thai lunch combination, which included a veggie roll and a small cup of soup along with the noodles. The veggie roll was a veggie roll. The soup was good, but slightly unsuspecting. It was like a sweet gingery lemongrass broth with one small slice of chicken in it. I also got a Thai iced tea that was good.  Overall, the food was just so-so. The place is clean and neat, service is fast, and my server was the absolute sweetest.",

I had ordered the Phucket Lemon Fish even though I also had my eyes set on either the Shrimp and Crab Pad Thai or the Yummy Duck Curry.  Since my dinner companion got Pumpkin Curry, which I fell in love with at my favorite Thai place by the initials of CTF, I decided to get a fish dish instead so we can share.  Two curry dishes just doesn't give much variety.    So the Phucket Lemon Fish was disappointing.  I also have a sneaking suspicion that the fish fillet is of the frozen variety which is a bummer since Mekong Supermarket is right across the hallway.  The lemony ginger sauce it sits in was bright and flavorful.  Too bad the fish didn't retain any of that flavor.  The Pumpkin Curry with chicken was okay.  The curry had a very mild flavor, the chicken was a bit dry, and the pumpkin was sadly overcooked.  As for the mango smoothie, that was probably the tastiest thing we had during the meal.  I'm honestly not a big eater but I definitely walked away from the $28 dinner hungry.  Portions are small, price is a bit high for what you're actually getting, and the service is mediocre.  It's not the worst place I've ever been to but I won't be back.",

This place definitely gets 5 stars from me!",

I ordered one pad Thai and two cha yen and had them delivered via Grubhub. The delivery man was on time and had good manners. I initially felt sad that I spent thirty dollars, however, once I received and enjoyed the generous portion of the pad Thai, I had no further complaints. I had typed special instructions via Grubhub to remove tails from shrimp, and thankfully there were none. My only pet peeve is the cup size of the cha yen and amount of ice; it leaves much more to be desired. Otherwise, it appears Thai Spices is my number two spot for ordering Thai food and I plan to order again should the nearby Thai restaurant not be available.",

Came in on a weekday, and had 2 lunch specials.  thanks to yelp, we also had a free thai iced tea (yum yum).  lunch special: pad thai + green curry chicken. both came with a light, lemongrass flavored soup with straw mushrooms and chicken. a nice way to begin. both meals also came with eggrolls, which were nicely fried.   pad thai and curry were both ordered medium hot, which is about as hot as we can handle it. I don't think they joke around too much with the heat here, because we were sinus-running-nose-blowing fools after a couple of minutes. the food was quite tasty, and a generous portion for lunch + price.  it was quiet when we went, and I couldn't help overhearing the table next to us. they thought the food was too spicy, and the server was very pleasant and remade the food with no spice at all. I love that the restaurant did that without complaint. please people, if you can't handle spice, just get stuff plain and add it yourself! this place isn't some massive chain -- it affects the bottom line of real people!  good food, good people, good service, good place. watch the heat!",

Also tried  their stir fried rice which was really good, a tad bit too much oil, but I'd rather have a little more than a little less.  Another bonus about this place is it's actually open past 9 PM, which seems like a rarity.  Restaurant also has a full bar.  I would recommend getting a seat in the front of the restaurant, rear has entrance to Mall/Grocery area which can be a little distracting while your eating.",

    "text": "It was my first time trying out this place yesterday. I was up in Phoenix doing a photoshoot and decided I would go hangout with some friends from Phoenix and go grub. My friend suggested this place, which is in Mekong Super Market, so I gave it a shot. To begin with the name really gives off what it really means. You are warned by just reading the name and seeing \"Spices\" This place can be a bit spicy for those with sensitive mouths to spicy foods. The setting of the restaurant is really nice, it's well clean and decorated giving that Thai vibe. The waiters here and funny and sociable, they even cracked jokes which I love! Nothing beats be able to have some laughs with other people while checking a new place. I went and started off by ordering a calamari appetizer. It was alright, it was like calamari rings with a spicy sauce for dipping. The sauce was a bit creamy with a kick, which went well with the calamari.  For my main entree I went ahead and ordered the grilled shrimp papaya salad. I really don't cook much of my own cultural food since I'm on a healthy eating diet so my fitness diet just consist of chicken and rice. So I do miss food that goes back to my roots and I love papaya salad and the spicier it is the better! This papaya salad came with 2 grilled shrimp which I never had shrimp with my salad before so that was a first for me. The shrimp complimented the salad very well, tasting that grilled shrimp added with the papaya and spice. Oh and to mention I got the hottest spice they could put it which they call \"Thai Spices\"! The food was was great! It really was as close to homemade papaya salad that my parents make at home, well minus the shrimp. But overall it had the right spices and a little bit of sweet taste along with the kick in the face spice. Overall I am impressed, I'd definitely come back here again.",

The Pad Woon Sen here was excellent!! Their style is a little drier than a few other Thai restaurants I've tried, but the flavor was right on! And as long as my palate is singing with every bite, I'll give out 5 stars all day long here! I got mine with a spice level of 3 (scale of 1-5) & it was consistent with what a 3 should be...just right!!  Will be back in a few days to stir up my cough with a spice level of 5 for some good abs workout if this cold doesn't quit!!",

It's right by the Asian supermarket, so I had high hopes. I was not disappointed!  Once you step in, the place has a great atmosphere. We went about 7:30pm on Halloween and didn't wait at all for a table. Service was prompt and our food arrived quickly.  I always get pad thai at a medium spicy level the first time I'm at a new Thai place as a way to judge. At first glance, the price is reasonable, but when the food arrived, the portions were huge. I ordered mine with tofu and I have no regrets. Usually I order a thai tea, but I had the ~adult~ version with vodka and Bailey's- a thai-tea-tini. Delicious!",

Right off the bat the staff were very friendly and helpful. The recommendation of trying lunch combo #1 was fantastic! I haven't had bbq pork at a Thai restaurant before and this really made my taste buds happy. The combo #1 comes with the bbq pork, some rice, chicken Pad Thai (like a whole half order! Surprised me) an egg role, soup and a soda.   The sweet and sour soup app almost made me wish I had a whole bowl of the stuff. It was the perfect thing to start with since it also had onions and chicken inside.   Like I mentioned before, the lunch plate is pretty big. The helping of rice is very generous and the Pad Thai was almost a meal by itself. The bbq pork was succulent and savory with a pleasantly sweet glaze. I would definitely have this again.   Looking forward to coming back and trying more new things!",

We ordered the crab puffs appetizer, a yellow curry, a Thai basil dish, and mango with sticky rice for dessert.  Their curry is very flavorful. I've found that their \"medium\" spice level is perfect for me- the spice doesn't overwhelm the taste. Anything higher than that, expect to be pretty spicy. The Thai basil dish was seasoned well and the flavors came out nicely! The food was prompt and delicious all around.  I was most impressed by the service. The sweet woman who served us checked up on us frequently and filled our water glasses often! She had a wonderfully warm smile and made it clear that she was there to ensure that customers had a great dining experience. If I could rate my review more than 5 stars, I would. Thank you, Thai Spices, for your inviting atmosphere and delicious food!",

I also ordered the yellow curry with vegetables and rice. The yellow curry was so scrumptious and hit the spot. I highly recommend it!",

I have pretty Americanized taste buds, but still I spring for the traditional menu often, it's adventurous without being intimidating, and it's less than seven bucks after tax for a properly filling meal. The soups in particular just warm you up inside.   Pad thai here is also exceptional and come with plenty of meat.  I ordered catering here for a large party and it was incredibly competitive pricing plus they delivered the order such a convenience.  Great place to bring people great date place too the decor is very nice and there is a great drink/happy hour menu. While not alcoholic, I do recommend their thai ice tea if you like sweeter beverages.   Really cannot speak more highly about this place, but there is a small warning if you are not a fan of spicy foods make sure you order yours MILD. Even some dishes when ordered mild will have a kick and medium to hot dishes can have quite the lingering burn, but I could just be a wuss. Order the sweet ice tea in case and the spice won't be a problem you can't handle.",

Happy hour appetizers are great. We only tried the spring rolls and crab puffs but after a few bites, we immediately ordered another order of each. The crab puffs have ACTUAL FLAVOR rather than just cream cheese! I'd become so accustomed to cream cheese puffs that when they actually tasted a little bit spicy, I didn't know what to think! And an order (of each) was only $1.50 for two! [happiness]  I was in the mood for curry, so the waitress recommended the green curry with tofu and vegetables. I ordered it medium spicy, and it might have been a touch too spicy for me. I'll order mild next time, but I might have been feeling wimpy tonight. My friend ordered the pad thai and commented about how it was sweeter than other Thai places (and he liked it that way). He's a southern gentleman, so he enjoys his food a little sweet.  The waitress was so cute and friendly. She was surprised when we ordered the second round of appetizers but obliged us anyway. (When two hungry 'rotund' people want more appetizers, you bring it to them!) Our glasses of iced green tea were always kept full, and the food was out quickly. I'd strongly recommend Thai Spices to anyone looking for good Thai food in Mesa.",

A new Thai restaurant was going to be in its place?? Sweet, we're down to try it! The doors were open for what we thought was for construction but one side of the restaurant was available for serving.  A familiar face from BoCa7 was Kang the server, which helped bring down the shock of BoCa7 being gone. We ordered Tom Yum Chicken soup and New Zealand mussels for starters...Tom Yum very flavorful and the mussels w/ broth had a nice touch of basil to it. We decided to get several dishes to sample and every one of them were great, but the 2 standouts were the Himmapan Chicken (Thai Cashew Chicken) and Talay Thai Paneng (Shrimp, Calamari, Fish and Scallops in panang sauce). I've had several variations of the Himmapan Chicken before and I really like Thai Spices' take on the dish using crispy chicken. Everyone kept digging in this plate as well as the Talay Thai Paneng, which had a nice buttery consistency to the panang sauce....so good w/ rice!   We also ordered Tutti-Frutti-Frito Fish (crispy salmon w/ mango and apple shreds and lime vinaigrette) and Tamarind Delight Shrimp (crispy shrimp w/ veggies served w/ a subtle tamarind sauce) which were also excellent. The apple and mango shreds gave a fresh texture and taste to the salmon steak, which was a big chunk. Thai Iced Coffee was very good. The only thing we wished was that a bucket of rice was served for the whole table instead of a small tray w/ a cupful for each dish. Oh, and that we were half-expecting the Tutti-Frutti-Frito Fish to be dressed up in a Chiquita banana outfit or that it would be served with maracas and a dance...I'm sure Kang can probably be convinced to do so ;)  We all agreed that we are returning here to sample some more of the menu's fare. Right now my bulging stomach wants to veg out a bit, haha. Great stuff...",

    "text": "Until recently, it has proved difficult for me to write a useful review of Thai Spices. I can't seem to get enough fried rice, so almost regardless of which individual restaurant I visit (with one notable exception), that's what I typically order. And as much as I'd like to review restaurants based solely on that preference, the quality of a staple like fried rice is only really notable if it's not up to par.  That said, we were there for dinner last night and I tried some of their other dishes. We started with edamame and their crab puffs. While we normally wouldn't order appetizers, the happy hour discounts are pretty compelling. I was somewhat disappointed with the edamame, which was cold by the time it was served, but the crab puffs were absolutely phenomenal. For an entree, I had my standard fried rice (Thai Spices does this better than most) and also tried my counterpart's Pad Thai. I thought it was excellent, but having never tried Pad Thai before, I don't really have any basis for comparison.  I've been here multiple times for lunch and want to make special mention of the fact that the service for dinner is markedly better than the service for lunch, with which I had been previously disappointed. I tend to drink a large quantity of water with meals and our server was not only friendly, but prompt and efficient. I think she probably refilled my glass six times.  Thai Spices is definitely worth a visit. With a focus on improving some of the small details mentioned above (edamame quality, lunch service), it could easily be given five stars.  -a",

It was nice and spicy and I added a bit of the chili sauce to give it some more zest. For dessert, I had the mango with sticky rice, which was fantastic. It was a large size portion and it was fresh and tasty. I highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "Thai Spices is THAI-RIFIC!  Yelper Mark R. periodically posts these scrumptious looking photos on Yelp from Thai Spices so I thought I'd have to check this place out when I'm by this area and I'm glad I did as my experience was VERY GOOD!  We started with tasty Sweet Potatoes appetizer. They came out very thinly dipped and didn't seem oily at all. The kind of potato they used almost had a sweet chestnut like flavor and was very good. They came with sweet and sour sauce that was OK but a little sweet for my taste.  My husband had the Thai Spices Basil with the added option of making it Thai Style with Chopped Ground Chicken and Crispy soft fried egg. The chicken in the dish was moist and flavorful and the fried egg was excellent. It had a thin crisp all around it and a soft center that oozed it's richness into the dish like it should. This was a much better variation of this dish than I had at several other places in the valley. However I did think this dish needed more basil and would ask for extra basil next time we are here.  I am a sucker for anything pumpkin in a Thai Restaurant so I had to order the Pumpkin Tofu Curry. This variation did differ from others I've tried but was still very good. This version was vegetarian and made with red curry. It had a silky richness to it from the pumpkin with only just a few tasty pumpkin chunks in it. The vegetables in it were cooked just right and the tofu was nice and helped to lightened this dish. I do note the portion was very small but it was delicious and I had enough anyway.  Service was friendly and efficient.  A very SOLID 4 stars   THAI-RIFIC! Located in Mekong Plaza",

    "text": "It sucks to say that I'm happy to give a business a 1 star review, but I am happy to give the 1 star review in hopes that the manager or owner would do something about it.  We've been to this restaurant twice. First experience was good. The lady who served us was really nice. Their soup was really good. I think it was their tom yum soup or something very similar.   My second and last visit there was a few months ago. My husband and I took our friends from out of town to Thai spices and it was a horrible experience. We went there for lunch on a weekday. Pls keep that in mind. A weekday, not a weekend. So, it shouldn't be chaotic, but it was. There were only a few people sitting at the tables. We were a party of 5. We ordered our food which took more than 40 min. Our server was very apologetic and kept on saying the food was coming. Our server was this young man, looked more like a kid. The only reason why I'm wanting to describe him was because my group felt like as if he was a relative that came in to work and was not properly trained. He looked very young. Anyway, 40 min passed and I was just about to tell our server that we were going to leave. The wait was ridiculous. We were hungry and embarrassed that we raved about this place to our friends, and this restaurant couldn't get it right. Right when I told him we couldn't wait any longer he said the food was coming out. Great! Finally. So, our food was there, felt like there shouldn't be anymore negative energy since our food finally arrived after 40 min. Well, to find out that my lunch special was the same amount of food that my friend ordered even tho his was the regular entree. My friend's dish cost more even tho we got the exact same amount of food. The waiter then realized that he mixed up my friend's plate with another customer's plate that was sitting next to us. The waiter took the plate from the other table and brought it to my friend and said, \"the gentleman said he didn't touch the food yet.\" Ewwww, how gross is that? How can we be 100% sure the other customer didn't touch it. My friend decided to suck it up and it since it's been such a disaster since we got there. Yes, we were trying to be patient and calm with every mistake that was happening. Soooo, it doesn't end there. Midway of eating, my husband realizes he didn't get his soup and his egg roll or something like that.... to be honest I can't remember exactly what was missing because this took place back in October 2016. This post is months and months late but I still can't get over how this restaurant runs. As I was saying, my husband was missing either soup or an egg roll that was suppose to come with their lunch special deal. We told the server, and he was apologetic. It was nice that he kept on apologizing but that's all he did. Come on! You could do better than that! Do something!   We finished our food. Paid. Tipped. We talked to the lady there, I'm not sure if she owned it or was the manager. We wanted to make them aware that they were going to lose customers. Yes, we've only been there twice, but still. I go to this plaza often because of the market and every time I see Thai spice, it bothers me of how they run things. If they continue to do what they do, I'm sure it won't just be my husband and I that they'll lose. So back to my story, we told the lady of our experience and she apologized but it felt like she didn't care and that she couldn't do anything. She didn't offer us anything at all. She didn't do anything to want us to to go back there. So even tho the first experience was good, the second experience was just THE worst.   Waited way too long for our food, messed up on our orders, gave us a dish that was given to another customer sitting at another table (definitely not sanitary), and lastly, they said \"I'm sorry\" about 10 times bc they messed up about 10 times... no joke... and nothing was done. No explanation, no excuse of why everything was such a mess. Nothing. No \"I'll discount your meal.\" We got nothing.   So, goodbye Thai spices. Please teach your staff how to deal with situations like this. If the lady I spoke to was the manager, then you need to know how to be more accommodating and understanding.",

So I give this place 4 stars. Wait staff is attentive. We came here with 7 people and everyone left very full. We started with the Tom Yum soup (make sure you stir the soup real well prior to serving to really mix up the spices). The Pad see ew and Pad thai were both a big hit. The Thai boat soup was just ok. The BBQ pork and Salmon mango were tasty. We also ordered the fried calamari (in my opinion nothing special) the papaya salad was ok I have had better but overall not a bad experience.   I wish they would have family style meals but other than that I would recommend you to try this place out. We will be returning.",

I had a crab appetizer - can't remember the name but they were a sweet creamy crab filled fried wonton. Yummy.  My husband had veggie spring rolls. Also good. He then had green curry with chicken - his go to dish at a new Thai place; I had 3 Flavor Fish, which was a large fish fillet, fried and served over steamed vegetables. It was all covered in a dark, peppery, sweet, soy glaze. Amazing. My husband said the curry was some of the best he'd had, and I'd never had anything like the fish. It was delicious. The food was excellent, it's not at all expensive, but the service, while quite friendly, was a bit slow given how few patrons there were. We live in North Central Phoenix so I'm not sure when we'll get back there. But if were in Mesa, it will definitely be on top of our list.",

Thai Spices Basil:  It is a dish that has Chicken or Pork sauteed with broccoli, bell pepper, carrot, zucchini and onion in garlic sauce.  I like the chicken one and I thought this would come dry, but it is a wetter dish with sauce.  Regardless, it was very tasty, meaning the spices made it delicious.  It is also kind of spicy, so if you don't like spicy, make sure let them know.  If you don't like spicy food, you can ask for no spicy food and they can change it for you.

Three flavor fish fillet 3. Thai eggplant  4. Calamari 5. Pad Thai 6. Crazy crab puffs  7. Green curry with chicken  Best part, they offer vegetarian alternatives!!",

I have given them more than one second chance to redeem themselves.  The meat is SO hit or miss. It's either incredibly cooked, or flat out tastes like leather and is inedible. It's gotta be a cook! When I get it during lunch time, it tastes like crap. Dinner time, generally, it tastes great! I usually get beef pad thai. I don't give them any specific directions to be \"well done\" or anything.   Sigh. I probably will go back, but only because my husband has had more good meals than bad. I will probably just get noodles and stay far away from the meat entrees.",

    "text": "Went here this evening with the boyfriend for dinner because I have had a wicked craving for pad Thai, and let's face it Pei Wei's version mad me sick to my stomach.   We were greeted by Anna as soon as we walked in. She sat us and got our drinks all in one fell swoop. She was smiley, nice and very prompt with any refills we needed.   I went in specifically for the pad Thai but after pursuing the menu I was tempted to veer and order many other things, but opted for the mild chicken pad Thai in the end. Morgan got the chow mein with beef and medium heat. For an appetizer we did an order of crab puffs since they were on sale for happy hour.   The crab puffs came out in about 5 minutes and holy cow, they were so good!!! The wanton wrappers were great by themselves but the filling was so good, and when paired with their dipping sauce they were fantastic. There were 6 in the order and usually we would split them but Morgan lived his so much I gave him one of mine. :)   Next our entrees came out almost as soon as we had finished the appetizer. The presentation was nice, the smells were delectable, and the portions, huge!  My pad Thai was almost perfect for me. The sauce was so yummy, a little on the sweet side for some people maybe, but that is how I like mine. I should have ordered it with no spice though, the mild was a little much for me, I guess I've turned into a wimp over the years haha!   Morgan loved his chow mein. He said the medium spice was just right for him and left his sinuses cleared. He also loved the huge chunks of veggies, still crisp and flavorful in addition to the sauce.   Our whole bill was 29.95 for two drinks, two entrees, and an app during happy hour. All in all a great experience. And they deliver on the weekend, yay! I will definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "My friends and I like going here, but my last experience was SO disappointing that I don't think I'll come back again.   My husband and I came here for dinner and I ordered the grilled chicken dish. It came with a salad, rice and a pretty large serving of grilled chicken.  The salad wasn't that great as it was doused in some kind of mayonnaise dressing. The flavors were fine, but it was literally a serving of mayonnaise with a side of salad... I moved on to the chicken and after cutting a slice off, we noticed it was pretty pink inside.  When the waitress came by, I asked her what she thought and she said she was sorry and took it back to the kitchen. She came back and said they were making a new one. My husband's food was already out and I would have preferred they just threw the chicken back on the grill, but it was too late.  Anyway, my husband finished eating and still no sign of my plate. Just an apology and affirmation that it was still being cooked. I asked to just get it boxed so I could take it home and eat later. They didn't even try to comp me for the dish, but whatever.  I didn't get a chance to eat it that night, but the next day I was looking forward to having it for lunch. When I opened the box, I noticed they replenished the mayonnaise salad. Next, I lifted up the first piece of chicken and I couldn't believe my eyes!!!  IT WAS THE SAME PIECE OF CHICKEN THAT I CUT A SLICE OFF OF IN THE RESTAURANT. There it was, the same \"NEW\" chicken that I waited over 20 minutes for. The best part? ALL OF THE PIECES WERE STILL PINK AND LOOKED RAW AS EVER.  Screw you Thai Spices (yes, I'm mad).",

The Thai Fried Rice, same thing - big chunks of zucchini, lettuce and onion! WTH?! Was someone too lazy to cut up the vegetables? Here's a tip: Go buy a food processor - it can cut the vegetables for you in just a few seconds!  I was not impressed - I'm a little ashamed because I've recommended this place to tons of people (look at my last yelp review).  The service needs to be improved too!

    "text": "Probably the best Pad See Ew I've ever had, but let's start from the beginning...  Immediately upon walking in, I was given... bar none... the most hospitable reception in my short history of dining.  It was comprised of a greeting (including being called by name) and a hug from the cutest little thing, who I had just met.  We started off with a chicken satay app, which was accompanied by a creamy peanut sauce and cucumber salad.  Removing the delicious skewered meat from the wooden spears brought me back to days of yore, when I would covertly poke my little sister in the closest appendage, with the sole purpose of evoking a squeal, all the while under the auspices of my no-nonsense parents.  My go-to Thai dish is Pad See Ew.  I've seen it spelled differently, but I'm hip.  This dish was one to be savored.... no, to be fawned over and then savored.  Using my meticulous chop-stick skills, I pampered each delicate noodle into my quivering mouth... which evoked blissful visions of lazily floating down the Chao Phraya river... and mind you, I've never even been to Thailand.  I'm not saying the dish was laced with opium, but at some point, I do recall fancying a ride atop an Asian Elephant passing through the seven levels of the Candy Cane forest.  My lunch companion, Chris, ordered the basil fried rice, which was more akin to an architectural wonder than an entree.  Using his meticulous spoon skills, I witnessed him moving mountains... of succulent rice and fixins... never to be seen again, for at least eight hours.  And just when I thought our culinary journey was disembarking, the same vision of loveliness appeared to my right, presenting a showpiece comprised of cake, cream and maraschino cherry.  Knowing my chop-sticks would only make a mess of things, I grabbed a spoon.  It had been so long... but it felt good in my hand.  A little cold.  I raised that utensil to the sky, and with an intense bellow, I cried \"By the power of GreySkull, I shall have you as my own\".  As I started my initial swipe, I noticed Chris had already gotten 2 or 3 bites in during the fanfare.  BAM!  The cake was bursting with coconut gusto, or maybe it was the ice cream.  I'm embarrassed to think of what I probably looked like as I descended into that dessert feeding frenzy.  I'd like to offer apologies to any staff and/or patron within line of sight.  I don't get out much, and unfortunately whenever my taste buds are stirred up like that, its plain and simple mob mentality.  I cant get in their way!  I wont!  After paying the tab, I bid a fond adieu to the huddled kitchen crew, and noticed their horror stricken faces.  The audible syllables \"Mujumbo hielan friacah\" lilted through the air as I passed... which I believe meant: \"Great manly warrior\"... no, my bad, wrong dialect... it actually means: \"Portly destroyer with awkward shirt cleavage\".  I look forward to my return visit, where I will exercise self control... or maybe just exercise",

(I may be exxagarating on size)   basil fried rice was bland, chicken was flavorless, overall taste/flavor/freshness is poor. onions were oily yucko and zucchini and broccoli in thai fried rice???? really?   eggplant with chicken was very good.  Overall blended, even flavor profile on sauce and ingredients.  panang curry beef comes in with broccoli and zucchini? really?  that's disturbs the overall  flavor  texture of the meal to no end.  also way too many carrots in the serving. the serving is already very small but insult to injury is almost cracking my teeth on small piece of bone in the curry.  yeah, I know  I should have taken a picture.  I let the server know but might as well be speaking kurdish. she didn't do shit and looked at me like I was stupid.  I am stupid for driving 45 miles one way to try this place with my family.  the only positive in the curry was slight detection of actual lime leaves and Thai basil in the curry sauce.  positive was the beef was tender and tasty, too bad for the stray bone. also wish there might have been some potato in the panang curry or just a hint more of lime leaves and Thai basil.  Overall service was very slow for 20% table coverage if that.  I really want to give a 3 for food quality, taste, appearance and freshness  but the bland fried rice, extra fillers like zucchini and broccoli, bone in the panang and combined with small soup and entree servings  sizes rate a solid 2.  Please all you regulars tell me I am wrong or just visited on an off day.",

    "text": "I have a new favorite Thai restaurant.  I came across Thai Spices when I was at Mekong Plaza trying Wholly Grill. The lunch special at Thai Spices seemed like a good deal, and I'm always up for trying new thai places - especially when they're within 1-hour-lunch-distance from my work - so i put it on my list to check out. Since then, I've been three times for lunch and once for dinner. Every time has been consistently amazing! With lunch you get a cup of Tom Yum Chicken, choice of egg/spring roll or crab puffs, and choice of entree (huge portion, not some scaled down lunch size sample portion!). I've had paneng chicken and pad kee mow - both are brilliant, but the paneng is out of this world. Seriously....I didn't think anyone would ever top my favorite paneng at Thai Orchid Garden in Goodyear, but Thai Spices does just that...it is ridiculously good. The Tom Yum looks like your standard lunch soup - clear broth, chunk or two of chicken, scallions, etc...I expected the typical pepper-broth flavor. No way, not here...this is full on Tom Yummy! So much flavor in that clear broth!!!  For my dinner visit, I had the Tom Kha Kai, Papaya Salad and Chu Chee Tempura (Shrimp)...ok, if the Tom Yum is Tom yummy, the Tom Kha is \"sweet-jesus-how-is-this-so-good\" good...my comment to my dinner mates was that it was so rich and creamy and sweet and delicious, it should be a dessert. The Chu Chee Shrimp (shrimp tempura with paneng sauce spooned over the top) was done just right - light batter, fried perfectly...it would have been great on its own. Adding paneng was just icing on the cake. (again with the dessert comparisons - i'm guessing they use a LOT of palm sugar in their recipes). Papaya salad was good - but to me Papaya salad is either good or terrible. It either is what it's supposed to be, or they somehow ruin it...it's never \"knock-me-over\" like a good paneng or tom kha is! Service was attentive without being clingy. In other words, perfect. Our server was pleasant, attentive, serious, casual, comfortable, social, and respectful - she juggled all of those traits as perfectly as she did our dinner plates. There when you needed her, not there when you didn't. Drinks were refilled at the perfect time, plates were cleared, questions answered...perfect! I'm already planning what I'm going to get this week when i go back for lunch. That's my definition of 5-star!",

It's not a very big place, yet it seems spacious if that makes any sense.  We were warmly greeted when we walked in and were promptly seated by the girl who was our server as well.  She was super friendly and attentive.  The menu is big and offered great lunch specials.  I went with the Spicy Beef Salad and loved that I could choose my level of spiciness.  I went with medium heat and it was perfect!  Just enough spice to give the beef good flavor.  The beef was mixed with diced cucumbers, tomatoes, shredded carrots, and red onion and it was all on a giant piece of romaine lettuce.  The portion size was just enough.  My dining partner went with one of the curries.  It smelled yummy and I got a taste of the sauce.  Very rich and creamy.  The lunch specials come with miso soup, rice, and an egg roll and they are only seven bucks!    This was definitely one of the best Thai restaurants that I've been to.  I wish there was a Thai Spices where I live!",

This is how I met Thai Spices.  I could go on about this and that and the lovely decor or how quiet it was or how attentive my waiter was.  I honestly don't give a shit.  I could have been eating in waist-deep water with an alligator feet away from me and my review and star rating would remain the exact same.  The BBQ pork that I ordered was the best pork I've ever had in my life.  The salad... eh, looks like it came from a bag and was presented in a darling fashion.  The Thai Tea was awesome (as always)... but, man, that pork.  It was so tender and juicy.  I've memorized its taste and I'm going to recreate it one day.  It may take me a while, but I'm doing it.  If my waiter had told me I was worthless, an accident, slapped me with a newspaper and then spit in my water, I'd STILL give this place four stars.",

They also have a self serve soup table, I think I had some kind of hot and sour egg drop with corn soup that was really delicious. They also provide little fried wonton chips to go with it and made it taste spectacular! I had the stirfry eggplant lunch special with fried tofu. I guess my food was good, but a little too spicy for my \"mild\" request. My mouth felt like it was on fire, I think maybe they made it hot? The rice was also a little soggy. However the eggplant was cooked really well. The pad thai was also very good and the portions are great for $6 specials. I liked the veggie egg rolls a lot, they were really tasty  And kudos to our server for letting me watch the nhl playoffs instead of the lifetime movie they had on tv. She was really nice about it!",

Occasionally the pieces of chicken are too big and it doesn't have that amazing crunch that I love, but luckily even when the texture is a little off, the flavor is still there. My husband gets the BBQ pork and loves it. He's also likes the yellow curry, not the best we've ever had, but still very nice. He got the Pad Thai and I wanted to gag it was so sweet, but maybe that's what it's supposed to be like, I'd never had it before. The staff is super nice.
