We ordered two amazing pizzas and two salads! Our favorite was a watermelon, cantaloupe, arugula and toasted pistachios salad. It was so fresh! We asked for the feta cheese on the side and it came on the salad. When we pointed it out to our server, she was so apologetic and gracious about the error. We were in hurry to catch a flight and did not have time to have it remade. She took the salad off of our bill and then surprised us just as we were about to leave with a new salad to take on our flight! I wish we lived in Phoenix so that we could eat at The Parlor on a regular basis!!!",

The building is 1950s, the architecture is so modern and to think 60 years ago the designer would know what to build so it would be in style 60 years later.. :)  It used to be a Saloon and they still have the original saloon chairs that they use as their \"bar stools\"super super neat touch to remind everyone of what the building used to be before converting to a restaurant a few years ago.  Super neat patio, has fireplace outside and also heated so even on the cooler evenings super comfortable to sit on patio.     Food was awesome, had the spicy seafood pasta and spinach salad both were off the charts great.  Also had the sauteed brussels sprouts for appetizers which was a very awesome dish as well.  Nice choice of draft beers also.",

Tammy was our server and offered a wealth of knowledge regarding the menu and wines.  The 'Blue Suede Shoes' drink she recommended was a hit as was the Autunalle pizza.  I lived in Sicily for about 18 months and while the Arancine did not measure up to those in Sicily, they were still delicious.  One person in the group had the Alla Norma pasta dish and just raved about how delicious it was - especially the seasonings.  We had the Banana Trifle and Tiramisu for dessert - again very delicious, especially coupled with the French Press coffee.  The food was great - the service even better....all of the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful...many kudos to Tammy!",

It's not salty at all, just a small hint. Kind of like a surprise. Back to the pizza...The crust was perfectly cooked, thin but not so thin that it's soggy after sitting a while. There was a nice firmness to the crust as well. I will definitely be back!",

Tomato jam interests your taste buds with the duck/bacon combo and aioli (okay...fancy mayo). I'd also recommend the Parmesan fries, which aren't the best by any means but still gosh darn addictive.   What I think shines here is obviously the pizza. I don't think the crust is as thoroughly cooked or tough enough to remind me of my favorite neapolitan pizzas, but when a pie topped gorgonzola and prosciutto runs at $9, I'll gladly accept it as an affordable, quasi-gourmet lunch. Wash it down with one of their groovy cocktails like \"The Gentleman\", with its cigar-infused bitters that taste like you're killing two vices at once.   Decor and staff are also nice. I'd recommend the dimly-lit booths for a date. I'd recommend the expansive menu for foodies. I'd recommend you get the hell over here soon--some selections are seasonal, after all.",

Love the decor and ambiance...from the beautifully lit entranceway with the fireplace to the dining room to the bar area.  It is dark and elegantly candle lit and yet very unpretentious because it's not a fine dining establishment.  I am in love with this restaurant!  An all around great place to get some great grub. We tried the Arancini (good but a little pricey for 3 of them),  and 2 pizzas-I had the Autunelle and I highly recommend.  It's basically all my favorite things on one pizza.  I had to stop myself from devouring it all so I could take some home and have my hubby try it.  Salads and pastas seem a little pricey but I didn't order them so I don't know the serving size.  I will be coming back to try out their house made pasta.  Pizzas are a fantastic deal.  Not authentic Italian pizza but I really don't care right now because they were delicious.  I am already thinking about when I get to return with my family. And our service was top notch.  He recommended a delicious wine for me to try which I thoroughly enjoyed.",

My guest ordered the steak panzanella salad with delicious focaccia croutons! The steak was dressed with a romesco sauce and was delicious. The flat iron steak was prepared, just as recommended, medium rare. I ordered the funghi 8\" pizza. The perfect size for one or for a lunch meal. The mushrooms were a great blend of different types and prepared perfectly. Roasted, the mushrooms were still firm but cooked as well. I said goodbye to the soggy mushrooms in my life a long time ago. The flavor of goat cheese was a great compliment to the truffle oil and mushrooms on this dish. Although the pizza was a bit greasy, it was still flavorful and I had no problem devouring the whole thing!    Continuing my quest for restaurants and bars with the best Moscow Mule's, I opted for a cocktail with lunch. With expectations high for my drink, I was let down when my drink was brought out in a bar glass. Where's the copper mug? I enjoyed the cocktail but I prefer the traditional mule in the cup!",

The wine list was also very impressive, again choosing my favorite the Malbec. I really appreciated the style of the restaurant and the ambiance which made it more intimate.   The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars is because I only experienced the happy hour and not  the normal dinner service. I'm most definitely going to visit again and looking forward to trying the rest of the menu.",

For entrees we ordered a Puttanesca seafood pizza and the Pecorino Tagliatelle pasta.  The pizza was cooked perfectly but I wasn't wild about the seafood.

The quality of their food is what really sets them apart - everything is made in house and you won't be disappointed even if you need to be skinny and get a salad because their salads are just as satisfying as their delicious pizzas and pastas. The wine and beer selections are great and their speciality cocktails are on point as well because these are not your average bartenders - these are mixologists.

We were a party of three and shared a charcuterie to start, the farmers cheese is a highlight as well as the tomato jam spread they serve with it, very good. We shared the Calabrian and Salsiccia pizzas, they were both delicious and very different. The spicy salumi on the Calabrian was complemented well with the creaminess of the burrata, and it was all set off by the freshness of the watercress. The Salsiccia has a nice earthiness from the sage and sausage blend, all brought together by a balsamic drizzle. The highlight was the stone fruit crostada for dessert,I want one right now. A perfect combination of flavors and textures, really phenomenal!  I can't end the review without mentioning how great the service was. Friendly, knowledgable and willing to offer great suggestions.",

It has the potential(bones) to be a quaint mod place....get rid of the servers, food and shit alcohol selection and it would be better than it is now. I can take the worst parking in the world for an outstanding place. This ain't it. Where to start, where to start???  1. The hostess moved like a barnacle as well as the wait staff. They were either all stoned on non-medical grade weed or were told to look and act aloof, disgusted and put off by the customers. It was bordering on comical.  2. I hate when new places open in the neighborhood expect you to pay high prices for food items and then have shit alcohol choices. We aren't by ASU. If we can afford your restaurant, we can afford higher end alcohol. Remember you are serving the publics taste, not your own. Do the research on high end, hell I would even take midiocre, alcohol choices and present them. You have such a varied menu, but then no choice of vodka..and no organic. Wine list sucks too!  3. It took 15 minutes to get a server and there were 10 tables open. I counted. Then she said I'll be right back..10 minutes later..then she only took our drink order, after she had to go see what kind of vodka they carried.  4. The worst ceasar salad I have ever had. EVER! It tasted like the tangy heel of a cheap shoe.  5. The cheese meat platter was a joke. They cut the meat in big slices for you, but not the hard cheeses and they don't label or tell you which is which... or give you a hard cheese slicer. NICE! 6. Our server came back after 15 minutes of getting our food, just in enough time for us to ask fo the check and get the F...out of there.   We then proceeded to Hula's Modern Tiki for the rest of our dinner, since we were still starving due to the fact that I was worried, that as slow as the wait staff was, that our dinner would spoil on the walk from the kitchen to our table and we would then have a hospital visit.  I'm not real keen on hospital food, but it would be a grade up from here.   In conclusion, if you don't understand good design, like less then sub -parr food, but believe you need to be seen in the new \"it\" place...just cuz...then go for it.   Now Hula's Modern Tiki on the other hand....reviewing soon.",

We split 2 8\" pizzas between the three of us. Each pizza had  6 cmall slices, plenty for the three of us. We had the pepperoni with fresh mozzarella and the Smokey, minus the olive tapenade (wife's not a fan, I think it would have made the pizza a bit better...maybe next time) Both pizzas were just well executed. my wife likes a bit more cook on her pies, but I thought they were great. The smokey had fresh ricotta, arugula and speck. That was the best of what we had, just well put together pizza. The menu seemed well balanced with some classics, and some that were a bit too new age for me (I just moved back from Italy a few years back and have seen everything served on a pizza, but some things are a bit much for me).  The ambience is nice, what a great addition to Central Phoenix!  We'll definitely be back..next I\"m eye balling the duck breast sandwich (anything with duck, breast or any combination of the two is right up my alley ;)",

He even recommended different combinations we should try and was honest about what ingredients we probably should not combine (on a build your own pizza). The sweet corn pizza (sounds weird) was one of the most interesting things I have ever tasted. It was my favorite. I give it an A. We also got the mushroom pizza with truffle oil (solid B+) and a build your own pizza with shrimp, speck, Gorgonzola ricotta and maybe some other things that I can't remember but it was delicious. The prcies are not too bad especially considering the atmosphere, with a small gourmet pizza (enough to feed one person and leave you full) for around $10.  I really can't wait to go back and try more of the food. Next time I will plan to stay longer and enjoy the great atmosphere over cocktails!",

    "text": "It is always a pleasure for me to go to this place. I don't know for sure to what extent they use local and/or organic ingredients, but it definitely tastes like they do and the wood-fire method makes the crust taste out of this world. Usually I sit at the bar and the service there has always been good. The bartenders are attentive and approachable, but don't hover or come off as obtrusive. I've also sat away from the bar area where you can watch them make the pizzas and at the patio too with no real major differences or issues. I like that they only have one tv and that it's in the bar area with no sound on so that you can follow the game as much or as little as you want without it dominating the social scene in front of you. The music played throughout is always interesting in an off the beaten path sort of way and never one type. It's just a variation of Pandora stations they play. Genre's that stick out to me when I've gone are big band, delta blues, new age, and techno. The lighting is great too and they like to use candles when the sun goes down. I'm very price conscious and even on a more liberal order for me with lots of ingredients on an 8\" pizza and a good beer it's difficult to break $20. Usually on my order I'll skip the beer, get a club soda instead, go conservative on ingredients, and it comes out closer to $15, give or take .50 cents (tax and tip included) and still walk away completely full and satisfied. While $15 isn't necessarily dirt cheap, considering the quality of the food and the experience, it's far better than you'd get for a similar price elsewhere. To me it's just a consistently pleasant experience in every aspect every time I go. On balmy days sometimes they'll open the wall that separates the patio from the inside.",

It came out with burnt bubbles all over the top and a completely burnt bottom. It was a huge disappointment. All I could taste was char. The only good thing about it was the over sized pepperoni slices which had great flavor.   I've heard the sandwiches are good but if you plan to get pizza, prepare yourself for some char. Yuck!",

I got the roasted corn pizza the first time we went which was delicious - just the right amount of sauce and a little kick!  Today I got the Zucca which had a more subtle flavor profile but was absolutely delicious!  My husband got the salsiccia both times so you know he loved it! We also got the sweet corn zeppole for dessert both times as they are absolutely incredible and my new favorite dessert!  We tried a few cheeses before our meal today - for $6 we got a piece of toasted soft summer cheese from California and a hard espresso cheese from Wisconsin with 4 pieces of rosemary flatbread and pesto/chutney for dipping.  SO well worth it - my husband and I both had a cheese-gasm with our first bites of both cheeses.  I can't recommend this place more highly - the service was fast and friendly both times we've been there and the food is killer!",

You get modern sleek surroundings, good service, and dishes that range from very good to stellar. The Parlor sausage pizza is ridonculous! (YES I SAID RIDONCULOUS) It is on par with the wize guy at Biancos imo, But here is why they are one of the best restaurants in Phoenix.. Some nights now during the summer they are offering reserve wines at 15 bucks a glass, that then unlock a 15 dollar special main course. We had a phenominal melbac, and a duck tartee that was probably one of the top 5 dishes I have ever had in Phoenix. It was foodie, complex, rich... Oh yah, it was 15 bucks.. I have had 40 dollar entrees that could not touch this dish.. Yes.. I did just have an orgasm, thank you for acknowledging..Parlor hits all points.. food, atmosphere, and service.. Thanks Parlor",

(Plus, I've been putting so many poor reviews out there lately, when I had a good dining experience, I wanted to recognize that.)  The main reasons for 4 stars and not 5 stars was the dessert and the service. Our waitress was certainly professional and competent, she just didn't offer that over-the-top sparkling warmth that other Parlor employees have demonstrated in the past. The host also had a bit of an attitude when we first opened the door. Just that typical teenage \"I'm so cool, I have this awesome host job, so I have so much power and influence.\" No, son, you're WORKING here and I'm paying your salary, so just a tiny bit of appreciation on your part would do wonders in making us feel welcome. As for the dessert, it was certainly good, but did not live up to the menu billing of \"Best Chocolate Cake Ever\". I can make an equally good, if not better, chocolate cake at home.  The salsiccia pizza was every bit as delicious as always and the duck club was outstanding, especially with the tomato jam just adding that extra little something. Go here, it is definitely a solid addition to your regular rotation.",

Got there around 7, zero wait, so that's awesome. Get seated, check out the menu's, figure out what we want...and then wait. Takes a few, but eventually a hostess swung by with some waters. Then our server, Susan shows up, and she kinda seems in a hurry/rush. Asks if we wanted anything besides water, and we inform we are ready to order. Get kind of a cold reaction, put off almost. This vibe continues for the rest of the service. Our food arrives and it becomes apparent one of our party doesn't have silverware, so we have to ask for that now. It was little things all around that kind of nickle and dimed the experience down. The biggest factor being the attitude of the serving staff, even when Susan got an assist, that individual had a poor demeanor/tone.   The food was fantastic, can't say enough good things about it, however the interactions and the service left something to be desired and definitely lessened the experience.",

    "text": "Decided to retry the place after 6 years.  We got the fried calamari and shrimp and was regretting this endeavor..  It was fried decently but it was so bland.  We added salt to the bits and the sauce and we can barely taste it.  The portion was pretty small too.  Then our pepperoni pizza came and it was actually pretty solid.  The crust was crisp and I do love the basil on it.  The sauce and cheese are pretty good.  We decided to go for the chocolate cake.  It was a very dense piece of bundt cake with whipped cream and dark chocolate shavings on it.  There was a cherry syrup and bits that really saved the dessert (you can barely taste the cream and shavings).  I think if it was vanilla ice cream instead and maybe some nuts on top it would've been on the really good side.",

We've had decent pizza in AZ at a lot of different places, but this was the first that we had the 'we're going to keep coming back here' moment.' We got the salsicca which is admittedly right in our wheelhouse in terms of toppings, and it didn't disappoint...Early in the week they basically give you a free pizza if you buy a pitcher of beer from their awesome tap list.  Amazing pizza and an amazing deal.",

We spilt a roasted beet sales between 3 of us - very light, fresh, - a perfect starter for the main course. We spilt 2 small pizzas - pepperoni and BBQ chicken. The crust in thin, the toppings very fresh. We also had a small bowl of the Cavatelli; it usually comes with port, but the pork wasn't fully roasted yet. So we substituted chicken. Who needs pork when this is so good!!  Eddie took care of us perfectly - a really delightful guy with a great smile. We just moved here and are right around the corner, so we'll definitely be back.  We've found our neighborhood pizza place!!!",

It was a beautiful night and the patio was packed. The hosts put us as close the patio as possible, in a two top afixed to the patio doors, which was perfect.   Our server was just the right amount of attentive. She gave us time to look at the menu, order wine, and gave suggestions on what size pizza and pasta we should share since I remembered loving all the dishes I had tried there.  We decided on a glass of sauv blanc for me, a cab sauv for him, a yukon gold potato pizza with an egg baked on top and a small bolognese pasta. I kid you not, the food was overwhelmingly delicious. The white pizza was creamy and delicious, while the bolognese was just sweet and savory enough to be reminiscent of italy. The wine was a great choice, I will definitely look for Mt. Beautiful Sauvignon next time I am out.  A++ food, A++ service, and a great night.",

Good beer selection, cocktails are well done, and wine selection is pretty good as well.   Food: Pepperoni pizza - winner! Duck sandwich - winner! Bacon Gorgonzola burger - winner! Chocolate cake - winner! Zeppolis (donut holes) - big winner! Steak salad (Paul) - yes it has vegetables, but it also has a full skirt steak. Winner!

I was impressed! This place has a great layout for perfect romantic, and fancy place to take your girl, or guy out for a special dinner. Well, i felt special knowing the fact that she wanted to surprise me here in the future. Lighting was right, alittle noisy, but it was ok. I enjoy the social noise.   The waitress was very helpful and respectful towards us ordering. She definitely kept us happy. And the food didnt take long at all surprisingly.   The food was great! Presentation was definitely nice to go along with the amazing taste. Very tasteful, nice and light, juicy, and creamy. The desserts will melt in your mouth with every bite. Maybe its just cuz i enjoy food in general, but id take another risk to go back here and try something else. The portion of the pasta dish was somewhat small. Wish i got double the amount for the price i paid for. Still enjoyable though.   Overall, this place is rated a five star to me nust cuz the fact that i was impressed that this is where my friend wanted to take me in the future. Its that thought that counts. And its an experience, and memory to have for sure. I definitley felt special that night. This place is good. And i recommend it to everyone!",

We enjoyed a customizable charcuterie board to start, and appreciated that we could choose the cheeses and meats to start with. We had a Yukon Gold pizza (roasted yukon potato, gorgonzola, pancetta, leeks, and rosemary) and the Roasted Beet salad (organic beets, walnut crusted goat cheese, arugula, fennel, avocado, gastrique onion, and white balsamic vinaigrette). The potatoes were tender and went well with the cheese and meat pairings, and the beets were amazing. I would definitely go back to try different offerings. Portions were adequate, but not enormous. We didn't have any food left over.  Service: Somewhat long wait time, but that was to be expected - we went at night, on a weekend. Server was nice and hospitable, but didn't go out of her way to explain anything very well. The mood was somewhat ruined by the people at the bar shouting intermittently at the television. If you want to be able to hear your date, call and check if it's game night before you go.  Other tips: We appreciated the valet parking, but they park the cars in the same parking lot that you would have parked in, so I'm not really sure what the point is. My car was literally 5 steps from the door.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I've only eaten the pizzas here. Because I found one I like and I'm sticking with it!  The Autunale Pizza In the winter months (from September to May I think) they come out with this seasonal pizza, which has caramelized onions, prosciutto, fig jelly, toasted almonds, sweet potato ricotta, arugula and some other toppings. It's the best pizza I've ever had. From anywhere. The only problem is that it's seasonal and not available year-round. UUUUUGGGGGHHHHH.  They cook the pizzas in the hot stone pizza oven. The crust is almost always perfect (there have been a few times when it's been a little under or over cooked, no big deal.)   There's a yukon gold potato with gorgonzola pizza that's really good too. Be prepared: the BBQ chicken pizza is a little spicy! But honestly, nothing compares to that damn Autunale.  The price of their pizzas reflects the specialty creations that they are. 8\" is $10, 12\" for $16. This is not Papa John's guys. The ingredients are premium and the pizzas burst with flavor.  Staff have ALWAYS been friendly. I've eaten in and, more often, I've taken to go.  Love the style of the place. It can be a little noisy when it's busy, but I really love the casual ambiance. I always ask for the quieter patio when I eat in.",

The pizza was really delicious!  The ingredients were so fresh, and I love the rich taste of the oils and cheesy crust.  I almost ordered one for take out! 5 stars for food, but 4 stars for service.

I forget exactly what we ordered, but I do remember getting the night's special pizza and being absolutely blown away.  The service was awesome, the type where you want to become friends with the staff.  And the food top-notch.  Free valet parking, great atmosphere, great wine... although I take no credit for choosing.  That's my job when it comes to pizza, and I can do my job quite well here.",

    "text": "Went here with JD's parents on a Sunday night and at 6pm the parking lot was packed. We dropped the p's off and finally found a spot in the parking area for the Armadillo (I felt bad b/c one of their waiters was outside having a smoke and saw us, but there was so much room there!!) Anyway, the place is cute, nothing fancy, but not trying to be super cool makes it pretty cool to me! I had the beet salad and wished I could have turned it into the chopped salad- looked much better even though I am a beet freak. I had the puttenesca pizza, even though the server didnt highly recommend it (she didnt like shrimp). I loved it! It was spicy and cooked perfectly- not too tough but still crispy.  The bar crowd looked like a fun bunch, so I will most certainly be back again soon!",

    "text": "It's a good thing, when what I have to say negative about your restaurant, has nothing to do with the actual quality.  The parking sucks, and its not easy to get a table in there.  I have really enjoyed bellying up the bar.  The bartenders were great for a conversation, and would leave me alone when need be to eat my pie.  The staff has been hit or miss though in general.  Sometimes they are great and warm up very well to my conversation, laugh at me when I am funny, and generally enhance my dining experience.  At other times I question if they are even earthlings.  The food here is wonderful.  I started off with a sausage pizza (I forget the technical name of the pie, but it had sausage).  It was very good.  Thin crust, which usually isn't my program in terms of pizza.  I enjoyed it.  Thank you once again to Schreiner's for the wonderful meat products.  The secret on the menu, however, is the burger.  It is one of the best in town.  It melts in your mouth, and is extremely enjoyable.  Welcome to the new and ever changing midtown, uptown Phoenix rotation.  I am a fan!",

To die for! The texture of the noodles is so much better. The sauce has a little kick that makes it double worthy. The clams and calimari are perfect. No rubberbands there. There is one downfall. The shrimp is always dried out. Not sure if its how they cook it or maybe freezer burned. Id like to say its happened once, but its always the same. Sea food linguini still rocks! I guess I should have them leave the shrimp out.",

    "text": "From hair parlor to pizza parlor -- I found The Parlor to be a unique, high-quality restaurant, and a welcome addition to my Phoenix neighborhood. Here's my take:  What I liked:  - The food:  There are plenty of pre-conceived pies on the menu, but where this place shines is the emphasis on build-your-own.  You can choose either a 9\" or a 12\" pizza, which link to per-item charges for proteins and veggies.  I asked for my pizza extra-crispy, and it came out perfect.  The salads were also fantastic.  - The drinks: a decent wine selection and a nice variety of signature cocktails.  I ordered the Basil Gimlet, which was refreshing and a drink I'd love to replicate at home.  - The service: friendly and attentive enough during this visit. We didn't wait long for anything (except for a table, which was understandable on a Saturday at 7PM).  We waited 25 minutes, but those a few minutes behind us were told 45 minutes.  - The ambiance: The Parlor is in a building once occupied by a barber shop, and the proprietors chose to keep the spirit alive vis-a-vis the decor.  The artwork, props, and even the bar stools are reminiscent of The Parlor's past days as a salon.  I'm just hoping I never find any hairs in my pizza.  What I didn't like:  - While the cocktails tasted nice, the sizes leave much to be desired.  My basil gimlet was 11 bucks and looked like about 5 sips.  I was disappointed when I watched my bartender discard the remaining beverage left in the cocktail shaker after he filled my glass -- which reveals the problem: the small martini glasses must go.  Perhaps the owners can do a benchmarking study at AZ88 for proper martini glass sizes.  - The bar: a bit small for a place this size.  The Parlor has True potential for a great bar scene -- they just need to devote more space.  All in all a great place and I'm looking forward to going back.",

We started with the Bruchetta, which was piled high.  The we had the Smokey (arugula & smoked prosciutto) and the Marg pizzas. Almost had the Pabst on tap, but went for the Dunkel since its harder to find.  As if the food wasn't enough, the decor and ambiance was over the top.  The herb garden as you walk in and the bar with the salon chairs was a nice touch.   Can't wait to go back.",

Chose The Parlor for date night a few weeks ago after a brief chat about another favorite local spot that recently added valet (seriously, this is Phoenix) and had zero open spots for us to park our own car (novel concept). \"Parlor it is.\"    This vibe in this place is cool and unpretentious. Wait staff was friendly and service was good.  The modern decor is awesome. And, believe me with a boyfriend who has a career in visual merchandising, we talk about these things everywhere we go.   His eye kept noticing great little details like the wood plank ceiling in the bar and the stacked wood blocks making up the hostess stand.  Love it.  We sat in the bar and managed to snag a hightop table to ourselves among the community seating concept even though it was a Saturday night and BCS weekend!  The warm glow of the ovens, the low lighting and buzz of people had us wondering why we hadn't added The Parlor to our list of spots before.  Can't wait to get back to you, Parlor.  You're now on our list.",

The first few times I got a stomach ache after....but that's probably cause we eat the whole entire thing. I don't blame the pizza(wo)man. I went there for my 21st birthday a few days ago and they brought me the most delicious piece of chocolate cake. I am not sure if I would try something different just because I know what I love.

This place has fantastic pizzas, I just think we should keep them lunch/dinner affairs. My hubby ordered the parfait which was okay but if we had the pay the full price of $10 that seems like a bad deal.

This hits all my buttons- chic, urban decor, excellent, unique, seasonal food, friendly wait staff and reasonable prices.   This place is known for their pizzas. They do a great thin crust, and have well mastered even the basics like margherita (absolutely delicious). They also have cooler, more uncommon options for those of y'all who are like me, and are addicted to the new and the different. I've had the Funghi (sucker for mushrooms and truffle oil), the Speck (ricotta, olive tapenade and speck) and the Yukon (potatoes! On a pizza! Too cool!), all of which are great. And this is across 3 or so years, since as mentioned I went there a few times a couple of years ago and then just recently twice in a short span of time. So they're very consistent in their quality as well.   I've only just recently tried their pasta. And lamented why, oh why did I wait so long?! The one that truly wowed me was their seasonal item, the vegetable gnudi. It had soft, fluffy, quarter sized gnudi/gnocchi, swimming in this incredible sweet potato and squash broth, that had brussel sprouts and a couple of other vegetables that I can't remember. I wasn't entirely keen on getting it- after all, their version of the carbonara sounded so much more tempting! But I'm working on losing weight and so went for the healthier option. And O.M.G. It's sad they don't have this all year around, because both me and my husband were blown away. This was sweet and savory and silky and rich, and had just enough gnudi in there to really fill you up. No sharing this puppy, no sirree. (Well, maybe with the husband, but I love him and he's paying for my meal.)   Their appetizers also are pretty great. I've had the Arancine, which are deep fried risotto balls. They're really awesome, crispy and rich all at the same time. And their roasted brussel sprouts were to die for. It had bacon and caramelized onions and I practically inhaled it all.  Cocktails are great too. I wish I could remember what I got, but I'm looking at the menu now and I'm positive it's not on there, so the cocktail menu is seasonal and does change, which is awesome. They're very unique combinations, and if you're stumped just ask the wait staff. They haven't steered me wrong yet.   So yeah, the food is great. Couple of cons- Parking. It's iffy. I would say bring a bit of cash and be prepared to take advantage of the complimentary valet. It's better than attempting to find a spot, failing, and having to go back and try to navigate the Camelback Rd traffic. The place is also a bit hard to find. If you're coming from the west, always watch out for the Data Doctor's sign. Then get into the turn lane right away! It's riiiiight after that. They also don't take reservations. I've not had a huge issue, but for truly enormous groups it can be a bit of a pain.   Fairly minor though, considering how great this place is. Definitely on the rotation of places I love to go to.",

The roasted cauliflower with cheese sauce was a bit salty, but very good. The roasted beet and arugula salad was ok. A bit under seasoned with dressing, and the arugula ratio was a bit much. The bone marrow appetizer was bland. The mussels in chorizo both were very flavorful, but a bit too spicy, the mussels were a little overcooked. I wasn't crazy about the cheesy thick focaccia-like bread served on the side with everything.  My mojito was refreshing and very good. My friend ordered a burger and enjoyed it. She ordered a drink that she had on a previous visit and said it tasted completely different. She told the server, but in the end...wasn't able to figure it out what was different.  I liked the ambiance and overall service, so I'd give The Parlor another try and order pizza and drinks next time.",

    "text": "I had high expectations for the Parlor, and I've been told to go here for the two years I've lived in Phoenix, but the stars didn't align until tonight, when my wife and I were able to sneak away for their happy hour.    First, the decor is comfortable and modern, just like any number of restaurants in Phoenix--think Postino's, the Vig, Windsor, etc.  We asked to be seated in the courtyard, as the weather was close to perfect.  Hostess was friendly. So far, so good.    A waiter arrived at the table that was seated a couple minutes after us and he enthusiastically told them about a fresh salad that had just been picked from the owner's garden, and it piqued our interest.  Our waiter arrived a couple minutes later and offered drinks, but nothing about specials.  I would describe our waiter as cautiously friendly.  I waited tables in college, and I remember waiters seeing certain patrons come in and wanting to shuffle them off of someone else...I felt like that patron.  I had a nearly identical experience at FEZ a couple years back, and I've only returned once.  There are too many restaurants in Phoenix to bother with mediocre service.    So service was a little chilly.  How was the food and drink?  The freshly-picked salad was excellent.  Bitter greens with fresh-made croutons and a beet vinaigrette with beets picked out of the same garden.  Simple, fresh, wonderful.    Ordered two of the happy-hour pizzas: the Margherita pizza and a pesto pizza.  They were both decent, with the pesto being a bit better, but neither were spectacular.  I still prefer Pizzeria Bianco for this kind of pie, and no one in town, maybe even the state, can match Pino's Margherita.  It just felt average.  I've also eaten a lot of pesto on trips through Liguria, so I know what I want.    Had the cherry zeppole for dessert.  Good, but not inspired, and probably wouldn't spend the money again.  Tiramisu is probably a safer choice.  I really wanted it to be better, but we were turned off by the service, and the food wasn't spectacular enough to overcome that obstacle.  Plus, I can go across the street and have better pizza with Bianco, and no parking headaches.",

My friend explained to me this establishment was an actual hair parlor before it was made into a restaurant, I enjoy when business take over old buildings and keep the history with it.  It was a Busy night and the only room they had for us without a reservation was at the pizza bar. (Love open kitchen restaurants)  We got waters, waited some, got  wine from the expo and that was the last we saw our server. Order food from the expo again after waiting some with suggestion that the kitchen crew gave us over the partition, order wine from another server who to me knew his red wines like a wine buyer, got our check from another server who was very apologetic about us having to flag her down.  When leaving I thought about giving this place another try, possibly earlier in the week instead. However this is where the tables turned. Our server approached my party and I outside the restaurant, while we were waiting for the valet and complained about his tip and how he thought his performance was better than that. I explained that I was a server as well including my partner and corrected him on his problem areas. He continued to argue with me about it infront of many others. Embarrasses and appalled - I don't think I will be back.",

I ordered the Seafood Pasta and it was way too fishy, the shrimp and calamari seemed over cooked and the sauce was drowned out by the seafood. My husband ordered the bolognese and it was good but not spectacular. I know they recently promoted their Sous Chef once they opened The Clever Koi so I just hope that he can find his own voice in the food and improve on these recipes.",

I immediately assumed that there would be a wait here tonight, considering that it's a Saturday night and as soon as we pulled in, there was no parking spot in sight and valet parking boys waiting for us. I was wrong. They took us the car and we were sat instantly.  What we had? The 12\" Salcicca (with caramelized onions) and Barbecue Chicken pizzas with Hibiscus lemonade and Calamari for appetizer. Talk about delicious! While we scarfed down the pizzas, we were comparing the quality of the ingredients of Parlor vs. Cibo vs. Pizzeria Bianco.  Although it was really REALLY good pizza, we both voted that Cibo is our FAV still. Why? Because the cheese, meats, and everything in general tasted fresher at Cibo, and the crust here was a little harder and more burnt here.. (if you're into that kinda thing).. but this place still kicks ass.  The ambience of the low lighting, misters outside, and cooling AZ weather made it a perfect night for awesome, unique pizza.

The service is wonderful and every single thing we ate or drank was delicious.  As good as the pizza is (that silky burrata...), the pasta is even better.  We just ordered everything then ordered some more.  Definitely the best ragu with pappardelle I've ever had.  Great wine list too.  Can't wait to go back.",

The food is very consistent and is a hit every time I am there! Must try Cavatelli Porchetta pasta! Definitely my favorite pasta dish on their menu!   Beautiful decor and atmosphere!

    "text": "The Parlor is one of Phoenix's best restaurants, it's a bit of sleeper when it comes to people knowing about it.  It's easy to drive by it and you'd never know it was there... Speakeasy rules is what I maintain for this place, I only recommend it to friends who can truly appreciate great food.  Why go there: We don't give out 5 stars lightly.  The Parlor on multiple visits has never failed us though. It's a great go to when we have friends from out of town visit.  It's a busy place, not far from the Biltmore where restaurants are plenty and feel like they can charge a fortune, the Parlor delivers on value from their open kitchen and relaxed vibe.  It's a bit loud in there, but it's just because it's always busy.  Their pizzas are fun to craft your way.  If you know food you will have fun with that.  Their menu changes seasonally and the specials always come through as fresh and relevant.  All pastas are house made, which that alone should draw any foodie in Phoenix to this place.  It's an unpretentious establishment that execute well, from hostess to waiters, every interaction you have there should be great.    Don't miss: The duck club is a staple on their menu, I ask for it to be put on a custom pizza... They might charge you $4 for the addition, but it's worth it!  Duck on a pizza? Throw in some garlic, tarragon and ricotta and you will be amazed.  Go for whatever appetizer special they have going on, as well as a main.   Their Yukon Gold pizza is fragrant and well designed, the oxtail ravioli is also out of this world.  Notice some of these are unconventional offerings, which is why The Parlor is fun to go to.  Tip:  Have cash on you, you'll have to valet, don't drive too fast on Camelback rd or you will drive right past it.  This place is a hidden gem, almost literally.  Grab a drink from the bar as you wait for your table, it's usually a good wait but worth it.",

The atmosphere is great, comfortable and rustic modern. We were seated at a nice table, our server helped us with the menu- it can be a little confusing but made sense once she explained it. My friend and I split a 12 inch pizza Margherita and a large Caesar salad as well as a bottled wine. My friend's boyfriend made his own pizza from the make your own list. Everything was delicious. We ordered the large Caesar at the recommendation of our server instead of two separate salads and it was perfect size. The pizza had a variety of sliced heirloom tomatoes and fresh basil. Thin crust was perfect!  My only complaint is the chairs were very uncomfortable.",

I drank: the house Pinot Grigio (3 glasses, I should have bought the bottle) I'll start by pointing out that we checked in via the Yelp app.  So we walked right in and sat down. I asked to be reseated because It was too cold at our table.   The counter was open so we sat at the super comfy chairs at the bar.  Our server Shelly was more than willing to accommodate.  We had excellent service from Shelly.  She explained the menu and was very attentive without being over bearing.  We sat at the bar and watched our pie being fired after enjoying out salad and cauliflower appetizer.  The salad was crisp and flavorful while the cauliflower was rich and savory. Our pesto pizza was served hot with a crispy crust and the pesto was some of the best I've had in a while.  Pros: Good food, great service, casual welcoming atmosphere. Cons: I don't like to have to valet park.  We had a great evening and enjoyed our food and service.  We look forward to exploring more of the menu next time.  Don't forget to check on Yelp and get 1/2 off a desert! What a county!",

Only thing that may make the experience slightly detrimental: no reservations (unless you have a party 15+)... and thus long waits for lunch... but it's worth it.

    "text": "This place is fine, acceptable, and slightly above mediocre.  I enjoyed the ambiance... though not \"parlor\" like at all.  With a name like \"The Parlor\" I was expecting a dimly lit, carpeted establishment with red and white checkered plastic table cloths and shakers filled clumpy parmesan cheese  on the tables.  This place is infinitely too hip for such nonsense.  Open, airy, brightly lit, and with minimalist modern decor, this place was a far cry from the pizza parlors of my youth-- which isn't a bad thing at all.   Our server was pretty average- friendly when he was at the table, but scarcely so.  It took an inordinate amount of time to get our check after requesting it-- a True pet peeve of mine.   The food was fine.  Good, not great. We ordered the cheese platter and it was pretty standard.  Just decent cheese with the usual accouterments. And the pizza too was good, but not memorable.    Despite being oven-fired, the crust was pretty standard, even a bit soggy.  They do have a nice, diverse cocktail menu with many unlikely but surprisingly tempting options-- but they come at a steep price tag ($9 or $10 apiece) and are not included in their happy hour specials.   With places with Cibo and Pomo Pizzaria around, unless this place is nearby (it was) and you're starving (we were), I'd opt for a pizza place with fresher tasting pizza sauce and crispier and chewier oven-fired crust.",

Thankfully I could steal a little food from the Hubby and one of the kidos, they had some delicious pasta (the cheesy bacon one) and pizza.  Those were delicious! so 1 star for my salad, 5 stars for pizza and pasta, = 3 today... I will be back, and I will order what I now know to be the best part of the menu.",

The Moscow Mule and the Bourb are two of my favorites, but most of them are unique and worth a try.    The food is also awesome.  The crust on the pizza is much thinner than your ordinary delivery, which is something that I really enjoy.  I highly recommend the barbecue chicken pizza and, if you're like me and prefer a little spice, have them add some serrano peppers.  Mmmmmm....I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  Finally, the atmosphere is extremely laid back and friendly.  You would never know that you are right off a major street because the setup makes you feel secluded and like you are a part of a private party.  The only downside is that parking is scarce.  This isn't a problem when there is valet (which there often is), but if those spots are gone, you are left to fend for yourself.  With that said, I always recommend this spot to any friends that are in town or any time that I've just had a rough week.  Speaking of which, I plan to pay a visit to the Parlor this week!",

The quality of the service is the issue. The woman that served my friends and I was rude, condescending and disregarded us. She approached her other tables very warm and friendly. I know we don't \"look\" the part or we didn't order bottles of alcohol, but we deserve the same dignity and respect as the other customers. The manager with the glasses and ponytail that came over after we asked, stared at me as if I was stupid. As of my complaints were going in one ear and out the other.I hardly ever complain about service because I have worked in customer service my whole working life. I have been served crap on a plate before and I was not as mad as I am now. Beware of this waitress, especially if you don't\"look\" the part or you don't buy bottles of alcohol. You have lost a customer and I hope many more until this changes.",

All of their salads are delish - you can't go wrong with any of them.  If there's just one other person with you, you can't go wrong sharing a pizza and a salad.

The pesto chiatarra was so tasty and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The other dish that stood out was the risotto with octopus. Our waiter went on and on about how good the octopus is and I have to agree. Be sure to order if it it's on the menu. I also enjoyed the tiramisu and turtle budino for dessert.

The dessert was delicious as well. Pay attention because you may miss this place. It is hard to find on the side of the street but it doesn't matter. This place can easily survive off of word of mouth solely. I just wish it wasn't so far from where I live. They definitely should expand locations like Pomo. The ambiance is great. It is a little darker and quiet which is nice. The servers are friendly and seem passionate about their job. The prices are in line with all of their competitors.

So good, and tender. Perfectly crispy with a light coating. We had the fried mozzarella salad, basically a great salad with a giant mozzarella ball that was deep fried sitting in the middle of a bed of lettuce. How can that not be good?   For entrees we had the yukon potato pizza, burger and pesto pasta. Yum. The pizza was light, great crust, but probably could have used a bit more sauce. The pesto pasta was delicious, with these roasted tomatoes that were to die for. The portion was a bit small, so I'd order it if I wasn't too hungry. And the best was the Gorgonzola burger with these perfectly seasoned fries. Juicy, rich, and mouth-watery good.   We couldn't leave without getting some dessert. We had a the Italian chocolate cake (with cherries), and banana fritters. The banana fritters were my favorite--they were like little balls of banana cake fried to perfection. They came with two dipping sauces that were heavenly.   I'd definitely go back to the Parlor and will be trying more goodies!",

I'd rather spend that time running back and forth between Pane and the Parlor feeding all of the hungry patrons waiting to get in Pane, the Parlor's delicious pizza and pitchers of draft beer).  The inside is large and in charge. Dimly lit and very earthy inside. Big comfortable booth looking out the window to a view of Camelback that was obstructed by a giant wall with the beginnings of vines growing on it. Who wants to look at 20th street and Camelback anyways? +1 star for ambiance and overall look.   Service was attentive most of the time, and although he forgot to get our straws and slipped up on one of our drinks, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. He was cool and recommended we try one of the \"mashed\" drinks and we went with Strawberry, but was accidentally delivered a kiwi one. It was one of the best mixed drinks I've ever had. Very fruity yet still very alcoholic. We went with a pitcher (!!!!) of Kiltlifter for 14bucks.  Not bad, we got 4 beers out of it. All of their beers are on draft and can come in the pitcher size.  They even serve PBR! +1 star for awesome drinks.  We went with 2 personal 8in pizzas.  I think it is a great concept to allow patrons to design their own pizza with toppings and cheeses.  We got a pepperoni one with parm and a house sausage one with feta and basil and spinach.  Both came out in a reasonable time and were crispy as hell.  Delicious! Both pizzas were cleared within 10 minutes.  The house sausage was spectacular and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting the Parlor.  Very good pizza for the price, much cheaper than a Cibo or Pane pizza and of comparable quality, minus the wait and snobby staff. +2 stars for price and pizza.  I see myself visiting the Parlor many times in the future.  Great beer, food, and atmosphere.  Service could be a little more attentive and personal but it was acceptable.  Phoenix has some amazing pizza in it's valley and can totally play with the big pizza boys of Chicago and New York. the Parlor can definitely hang.",

In fact, we took our leftovers home in our cooler safely tucked on ice for the 6+ hour drive home! The remaining pizza slices were devoured the next day.

The pizza was fresh and savory. The crust was perfect, it was the best part. We ordered 3 pizzas, Margarita, pepperoni and bacon, and Sausage with pineapple. The Margarita was my favorite, fresh tart tomatoes, salty mozzarella, and delicious basil. In my opinion it had to little basil but it was still tasty. The other pizzas came with their house blend of cheeses but it made the pizzas greasy. They are stingy on their toppings, very little bacon and pineapple. The ambiance was soothing, the server was polite. Would go back if I ever get to phoenix again.",

    "text": "I started with the mozzarella salad, the cheese was very firm. I sent it back. Next up was a margarita with mushrooms. Although the pizzas at Parlor are decent, they are not really wood fired at all. Yes, there's wood in the oven, however if you look into the oven on the right side you will see that it is actually burning gas. True Neapolitan style wood fired pizza is cooked in the range of 800F using only wood.  BOTTOM LINE: Decent pizza, but no comparison to PB",

    "text": "Fabulous time at this restaurant tonight in celebration of my partner's birthday. A friend gave us gift certificates a while ago, and we finally made it in with our daughters (10 and 8).  We were there early on a weeknight, so no problems getting a table.  We settled in, the girls began playing with the wikki stix, and we enjoyed the ambience.  Cool, comfortable, lovely music playing; the sunlight and heat were kept at bay, and yet the restaurant was still light and airy. We ordered drinks and an appetizer, then reconsidered the yummy menu. Our server was very professional and friendly, and prompt on details throughout the night, beginning with the drinks order.  Partner had the duck club, which he said was amazing.  I had the funghi/goat cheese/chive/truffle oil pizza, which was utterly devine. One child had grilled cheese, which was hearty and delish without having pointy edges that kids in braces hate. And the other child custom-ordered a shrimp and pineapple pizza, which she claimed was very good. We finished our meal off with a piece of chocolate cake with these lusciously flavorful marinated cherries and sweet cream.  We will definitely go back, and in fact, I'm already planning a date night (sans kids), where I can enjoy one of the intriguing cocktails on the menu.  Thumbs up from all four of us.",

I feel however that this place is slightly overrated as it is very hard to get a parking spot and table. I guess I just don't like being around a crowd much. Anyway my understanding is that the guy who runs this place is a nephew to the previous owners of Nello's  I would go back but this is more of a special occasion place for me simply because of the difficulty getting seated.",

Service was fine, my Steak Panzanella was perfect.  However, my husband ordered the Parlor salad, $14, plus chicken, add $6.00, plus side of Parmesan $1.00, plus an extra small salad dressing!  So put it all together, his little chicken parlor salad that had about 1/4 of a chicken breast in it ended up being $23.  He had no idea they would charge extra for a small (maybe 2 tbs) container of dressing.  This was a first for us to be charged for the Parmesan plus the dressing.  There are lots of restaurants in town.  This will no longer be on our bucket list!",

    "text": "I went to The Parlor last sat for my birthday with 7 girlfriends and had an amazing time! Our server was fantastic and prompt, the food was wonderful, and the space was really cool.  My favorite dish was the Roasted Beet salad- it is the perfect size and really flavorful. We also had the calamari, tomato and red pepper soup, Margarita and pesto pizza. Everything was tasty! :) Also, our waitress came by to apologize for the pizza's taking so long (we honestly didn't even notice) and gave us another order of free calamari and any dessert we wanted which was a great bonus.  My only complaint- our cappuccino's were cold. I do get annoyed when you go to a restaurant and you can tell they put a great amount of detail and work into their presentation......... then you order a nice after dinner coffee. Which is either cold or crappy. That's a bad way to finish a meal if you ask me. (Sorry, rant is over!)  So, back to the review, I had a wonderful experience at The Parlor and will be bringing all of my friends there! Great food, great prices, great service, great space. :)",

This experience was very different and maybe even extraordinary.  Almost flaky crust, not nearly as thin as I like it, but done very nicely as a compliment to the toppings and NOT an overpowering plaza for them to sit on.  The Potato Pizza was to die for as was Mushroom Pizza (Fungi) each with their distinctive flavors and all of the flavors of the various ingredients were allowed to come through, as opposed to just a melange of flavor.  The Calamari and Shrimp (Fried) appetizer was excellent also, although NOT a very big portion.  I am converted!",

    "text": "Have you ever had a vision of how you think something will be, and the reality isn't what you thought it would be? Well, I think that may have been a bit of my problem with The Parlor. After reading the reviews of this place on here (and I trust y'all!) I was very excited to visit the Parlor for my birthday dinner Thursday.   Sooo...  The good: the pizzas were amazing! We had the Yukon Gold and the seafood pizza and both were delicious. Maybe not as great as Pizzeria Bianco, but we also didn't have to wait 3 hours. We sat on the patio (yes, in July! it wasn't bad at all). Also, as some previous reviews have mentioned, they have PBR on draft....which made me giggle.   The \"meh\" (I won't say anything was bad about this place, but just meh) The service was pretty slow, and the server not super friendly. She wasn't rude, but just sorta lackadaisical. The appetizer (meat and cheese plate) was really small for 4 people (and we asked if it would be enough) Seriously, we each got one piece of prosciutto, one square of pita, and some cheese. We also had the ginger martini, which the server recommended, and it was basically a shot in a martini glass for $11.   Overall, I would go back, but it wouldn't be my first choice. However, it is a great addition to the downtown Phoenix/Biltmore circuit, and I definitely would have their pizza again!",

    "text": "I dine at The Parlor every time I'm in Phoenix.  The prices are excellent, the food is devine, and the space is playful (think beauty parlor turned pizzeria featuring a small garden out front).  This time, I started with the beet salad with arugula, avocado, gastrique onions, and fennel that was light, fresh, and flavorful.  The crisp fennel was a great compliment to the creamy avocado and sweet onions.  I also had the chickpea panino.  While I am really pleased that The Parlor offers such a unique vegetarian sandwich (portobello mushroom sandwiches are not the only food vegetarians enjoy eating), I thought this sandwich lacked a substantive flavor profile.  Next time, I'll probably stick with pizza or pasta.  For dessert, my mom, aunt and I split three desserts: the bundino, sweet potato cheesecake, and the bread pudding.  The bread pudding was extremely disappointing!  It was dry and despite being able to see vanilla beans in the sauce, it was basically flavorless.The budino was standard, but excellent: delightfully creamy with a rich, chocolate flavor.  The sweet potato cheesecake was my favorite dessert.  The cheesecake was light and airy, and didn't feel too rich.  The maple chocolate sauce perfectly complimented the autumnal flavors of the cheesecake, and the pistachios added saltiness and an interesting texture.  Overall, another excellent experience at the Parlor!  I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants an excellent, reasonably priced lunch or dinner  in central phoenix (including families with children, as the Parlor has wikisticks available for their little guests to play with, which are always a huge hit!). Enjoy :)",

It's one of those places that hides it's True essence from the outside, per the deco brick all along the outside, pulling you in to see whats behind.   When you walk in you have a great view of the bar, with big open windows, it's a great feel. I would love to go back and just hang out at the bar even. The dining area is very big and open as well. They also have a fun looking bar kitchen seating area where you can watch them cooking while you dine.   They have a great build-your-own menu that is always fun to experiment with. We did the build-your-own meat and cheese plate. Amazing! Must try! Then we had the Fungi pizza, with wild mushrooms, goat cheese and truffle oil..... very yummy!   The staff was nice and friendly. About the only non-possitive thing I can say is that there is a lot to choose from on them menu that looks and sound great so choosing what to order is a bit difficult. I am looking forward to returning!",

Also they had PBR which is always a good sign in my book.    The only reason I am giving it four stars and not five is because I didn't get a pizza with tomato sauce. My wife and I had two specialty pizzas. I base my review of a pizza place on their signature tomato sauce. I may go tomorrow for lunch to try just a regular pizza with tomato sauce and may upgrade my rating to five.",

    "text": "I have been going to the Parlor since it first opened and I consider myself a big fan of their food, service and decor all of which is in the upper echelon of the food scene here in Phoenix.   Being a born and bred New Yorker, it is not an easy thing to make me excited about pizza here in the southwest but the pizza at the Parlor makes me a little less homesick for my NYC pizza faves. Simply put, they make a really satisfying pie with a nice thin crust, flavorful cheeses and other fresh ingredients. My only criticism is that sometimes their pie makers do not always find that sweet spot in the oven that allows the bottom of the pizza crust to cook more evenly and insure even crispiness. But this is a minor criticism. I also recommend the ceasar salad and the spinach salad which are both excellent. And their burgers and fries are also of the best in Phoenix. As for dessert, I've had the tiramisu and the chocolate cake and am very impressed with both.  The service has always been consistently good. I've been to Parlor both at peak and off hours and their staff has always been attentive, friendly and prompt. My only criticism has been that they are some times a little too eager to get you the check at the end of the meal. I would rather leisurely sip my coffee and nibble at a dessert without having the server lay down the check next to me while I just begin to do so. But this is a very small issue and considering how unbelievably poor restaurant service can be in this town, I'll take Parlor's overpromptness any day over bad service.  The decor at the Parlor is also worth mentioning. Modern, using some of the old beauty salon features like the barber stools at the pizza bar adds a warm and unpretentious touch.   All in all, the Parlor is always a happy experience which I always look forward to coming back to.",

Both have great energy and the atmosphere is unique and very pleasant.

The service was Friendly and knowledgeable. This review is meant for Parlor but I can't knock one over the other. I'm sure you can add and subtract from the dishes at Cibo's too. Parlor is newer and you should check it out. They both are very delicious. JT",

    "text": "I VERY much enjoy this place.  The Duck sandwich has changed my life.  The brick oven gives the pizza a natural, full flavor, homemade style taste that makes you slow down and enjoy every bite!  The atmosphere, the set up, and the bar is all very welcoming and very clean.  Hard to spot when you are driving down the road.  i have been there about 10 times and i still pass it up sometimes.  Parking is not the best, and valet is not really needed, but they very much have top shelf alcohol and delicious food to boot.  Not extremely expensive either, but pricey enough to make you count your bills before you enter just so you will have enough.  Great place!",

Also, they have Mr. Pineapple on tap (the wifey's favorite local beer) always a bonus. I highly recommend - great food, great service and great ambiance.",

There was a group of 8 with a crapload of kids in front of us, waiting for the rest of their party to arrive.  I let the hostess know that I'd sit anywhere...except nowhere near them.  Ha!  She put us on the patio. I love patio heaters.  They are necessary in the winters here and the patio was really cozy and warm.  Not overbearing, juuuuuuuust right. I had a pasta dish with seafood and a spicy red sauce.  I like that the meals come in two sizes, as leftovers don't work very well with shrimp.  It gets rubbery.  Blech.  It will rot in my fridge next to the broccoli.   The service was spot-on, as I never had to ask for a refill on my drink.  Really nice guy.  Cute, too. The prices were great, even though I didn't have to pay.   I love valet service, too.  Didn't have to pay for that, either.",

We celebrated a birthday dinner for a friend, just 4 good friends together in a booth- we were each greeted by friendly smiling hostesses and seated in a comfortable booth.  Started off with a bottle of Seghesio-Zin, Parlor Insalata and Caprese. The salads were excellent and plentiful-- the caprese mozzarella was really delicious.  Moved onto 3 pizzas:  the Funghi, the Smokey and the Margherita (with sausage added) and they were all sooo good.  The Funghi was my favorite despite my love for meats.  Since it was my friend's birthday, they bring over a piece of to die for chocolate cake with italian cherries and vanilla cream-- oh my!  SO decadent.  Our server was so nice too, she was cool-- we liked her.   Then we topped the night off with more great conversation and laughs .  The Parlor was a sure hit and I already can think of future moments that need to be spent there, especially on the patio.",

Amazing cocktails and classic cocktails.  I highly recommend the Bourb.  This is the best new cocktail I have had.  Maker's Mark and Amarena Cherries on the rocks.  Very tasty.  Arancini here is some of the best I have had and have a bit of extra cheese in the middle.  Any pizza choice here is awesome.  This place focuses on little things that make common food better.  The bbq pizza was pretty normal, but they had fresh sliced serrano peppers that MADE the pizza.  Just a little attention to details makes this place awesome.",

Our group ordered the calimari and brushetta to start and it was good. The brushetta was a little overloaded and dripped everywhere on me... but that's because I am a spaz when I eat. For pizza we shared the sausage, bbq chicken, and the yukon gold. The bbq chicken was very good, but I was taken aback by how hot the jalapenos were. I had to pick them off, lest they burn me twice. The sausage pizza was very nice and I'd order it again. The yukon gold pizza (with leeks, pancetta, and gorgonzola) was not a hit at our table. Out of the 5 of us, I was the only one that really liked it. Oh well... I got leftovers suckas!",

    "text": "I've been at the parlor several times. Slightly odd decor and nice exterior. Food is a mixed bag for me. Pizzas are ok, sandwiches oddly filled and come on a strange bread that has to be perfectly fresh or the sandwich is ruined - and that happened a couple of times. So far the brie burger is my favorite. It is super greazy but goes down pretty well. The fries that come with it are VERY nice but I don't bother with the salad because it tends to be very tart and otherwise flavorless. Most of the salads don't appeal to me, but I usually do enjoy salads in other places. Service is moderate and has improved. Used be quite bad.   The bar stools are a turn-off for me; barber chairs... yuk. This place used to be a hair salon and they kept some of the hair styling furniture and decor. I don't like to associate my meals with hair clippings but the thought is forced into my head. Please, what are they thinking in that place.   I'm usually there with a group. Not my first choice but if someone in the group wants to go then I don't fight it too much; it's not horrible.  Update:  So I ended up in this place again, and my experience is not much different this time either. This time I am beginning to notice that the pizza crusts are always burned or the have a large spot or two that is black.  Today, three of us had pizzas and every one of them has a nearly black rim. Is it just me?? I like to eat the crust edges, but don't like when they are burned that way.",

Then I changed jobs.  :(  Now, it's a treat and yes, I make the drive for this \"treat\" fairly frequently because I crave the mushroom and goat cheese pizza.  I've been disappointed by the pasta dishes I've tried so now, I stick to the pizzas and charcuterie board (and occasionally salads).  Their wine list is pretty good and surprisingly, most of the servers are well educated on the wine list!  Two thumbs up for that.  Sometimes the service can be a tad relaxed (read: slow pace) so, if you're there on lunch, do let your server know!  They're attentive and will move things along a bit faster for you if they know you have a time limit.",

The servers are so trendy that it makes me want to ask them to be my friends. The atmosphere is funky and perfect for a date or time out with friends. I've been for lunch and dinner and both were fabulous. I especially love their herb garden outside the restaurant!   The Parlor's menu is not my favorite (not their fault at all...I'm way too picky), but the food that I do order is always fresh and delicious. They switch it up on a regular basis, but some of their risotto is amazing. I also LOVE their Hibiscus Lemonade!   I went in recently and ordered a margherita pizza minus the tomatoes (yes, I order margherita pizzas wherever I can). The server brought me my pizza with tomatoes all over it. I was not too thrilled, but didn't want to complain. She immediately noticed the disappointment on my face and realized she had made a mistake. I wouldn't let her make me a new one because it really wasn't that big of a deal. Nonetheless, at the end of the meal my server brought me a certificate for a free pizza during my next visit. When I thanked her I believe her exact words were, \"I've seen you guys in here before, I know you're here a lot...I want to make sure you're happy. We definitely want you back.\" How sweet was that?! Her attitude and attentiveness made me want to come back even sooner.  See you there!",

As some other reviewers point out, the parking situation is pretty bad, with an understaffed valet as your only option if there's a crowd.   I started with a meat & cheese plate that was very good. My selected meats/cheeses came with pesto and a tomato sauce, along with some very good flatbread.  I then tried the farm greens salad. I was pleasantly surprised--this was an excellent salad, thanks mostly to sweet pears contrasting with spicy-coated pecans, and chicken that was clearly hand-pulled from a whole roasted bird (and, unlike most chicken on salads, this included both light and dark meat).  Finally, the pizza. It is an almost-Neapolitan style, thin but with a substantial crust around the outside. Rather than being spotty-charred like a neapolitan, the crust had an all-over gray color to it. The crust quickly became soggy in the center of my 12\" pizza, but the overall flavor was very good. The toppings were good quality, but the sausage on my pizza overpowered the flavor of the cheese and sauce.  Overall, The Parlor is a place I'll gladly come back to. It's not my absolute favorite pizza in town, but it's close.",

I settled on the duck pizza (because I'm a huge fan of anything with Duck) with a butternut squash puree. It was delicious! However, the Salciccita pizza prepared with Schneider's sausage was amazing! Duck was good; Salciccita: Fantastic!

I also love Meghan L. but she's leaving us...  At least The Parlor is here to stay.  Let me eat my emotions!  It was a fabulous dinner tonight filled with a parade of pizza, alcohol, and dessert!  Majority of us [excluding me because I suck] arrived on time at 6:30PM and seating was prompt.  Food was ordered and suddenly the table was a blur of slices being exchanged and food was being consumed.  Noms I got to try:  -The Funghi  which consists of roasted mushrooms, goat cheese, truffle oil, and chives.  Thank you Yuko H. for exchanging a slice with me!  The goat cheese gave it a creaminess that melded well with the chunks of meaty mushrooms.    -The Market Pizza, which changes frequently so I don't know if this will be helpful but it had golden yellow beets, a beet puree sauce, walnut pesto, spiderella, feta cheese, and added bacon.  I'm not a fan of walnuts but I was seriously digging the walnut pesto.  I never had spiderella until tonight either and I gotta say that the earthiness of the greens was amazing against the sweetness of the beets.  - The Summer Corn which is made of roasted summer corn, chiles, a corn puree, spicy crema, cilantro, and added goat cheese and bacon.  This one had the boldest flavor.  I had originally thought that this would be a sweeter pizza since it had corn but the spicy crema fights for dominance.  I like the added bacon which adds more saltiness to the otherwise spicy slice!  - Tiramisu, we all know what's in it but they added something extra in theirs:  pine nut brittle.  This was probably the dish I'd skip.  The pine nut brittle was so overly sweet that I could do without it completely.  There was also this weird moisture at the bottom that wasn't espresso.  The atmosphere was absolutely lovely and intimate and our waitress was amazing.  She took the time to go over the menu and seasonal items with us in great detail and never made us feel like a burden.  She packed our leftovers, the busboy took our photo, and the staff here is just really awesome.  Even the valet made for pleasant company!    You are what you eat and I am pizza.  I also need to live in Meghan's pocket because I'm already getting separation anxiety.  Help.",

The cocktail menu is sound and if you like old fashioned this is one if the best you will taste. It has a VERY smooth taste with not so much of that bite from the bitters. I like a strong bitter OF but the smoothness really is amazing.   The pizza I order is the best I've tasted in Arizona... I get the Spicy Florentine and then add sausage, flipping amazing with the Ricotta cheese. I feel like getting in the car right now *drools*  We had a big party of about 15 for my birthday so I tried to call in advance and reserve a table. The manager called me back and told me that you have to pay in advance $40 per head which I was not willing to do myself. It actually pissed me off a bit but honestly... The pizza and cocktails are so good I couldn't possibly rate less than a 5.",

I ordered the house made tagliatelle noodles with the classic marinara and I have to say it was amazing.  My hubby ordered the pepperoni pizza, he said it was an 8 on a scale of 1-10.

We tried a red blend from Washington and wow was it good. We ordered the mozzarella salad (forget the official name) but was it so good. When they brought it we were weirded out because it looked way different but never judge a book by its cover, man was it good! After our salad we ordered the pesto pizza add chicken and maaaaan was it good. I was nervous because I'm picky about pizza but wow I'll be back soon.   Everything about this night was great. Super friendly service. Amazing food. I looked up their happy hour and wow I'll be back soon. Pasta and bottle of wine for $35 on Monday Tuesday's! Wow! I'll be back soon.

The pizzas looked good, but the hubs and I were in the mood for some Italian.  We were seated right away and waters on the table almost immediately. We put in our drink order for a refreshing pinot grigio and the fritto  misto. The wine went well with our meal. The fried calamari and shrimp were well seasoned and crispy. The dipping sauce was a step above the average cocktail sauce. The husband got the large Cavatelli Porchetta and loved it. There was a good amount of pork in the dish and the house made pasta was like biting into a good cheese. That sauce though. Man it was flavorful! Just the right amount of kick. He killed the dish. I ordered the spicy seafood linguine. I loved the spiciness! It definitely had a Louisiana seafood boil taste to it. The small plate was enough food for me. I didn't even finish all of the noodles.  Service was solid. The server was knowledgeable and descriptive about the menu. I could see us coming back, especially to try their happy hour.",

    "text": "I had only been here once before, and that was for takeout.  Me and my friend decided to head on back for a little happy hour action before our baseball game downtown.  We asked where we wanted to be seated, and we chose outside.  Turns out, that was a bad choice.  Choose inside...you will see why later on.    The Parlor has a great happy hour.  $7.00 pizzas and $5.00 appetizers.  We each went with a pizza, and an app. I went with the \"House Pizza\" and the Fritto Misto for my appetizer.  My friend went with the \"Salsiccia Pizza\" and the Cauliflower appetizer.  I had a Coke to drink.  Here is how everything was.............  Fritto Misto-  This is a mixture of fried calamari and shrimp.  It was excellent!  The breading was perfect, and both the shrimp and calamari rings tasted great!  It was served with a little cocktail type sauce and everything worked well.  For $5.00 during happy hour, this is a great appetizer!  I would definitely get it again!  Cauliflower-  Surprisingly, not bad!  Its baked cauliflower and cheese.  I ate a few pieces and it tasted pretty good.  My friend really loved it and took about half of it home to eat later on that day.  I would probably get it again.  House Pizza-  This pizza is described as, \"Bacon, kale, giardiniera, mozzarella and garlic.\"  It sounded pretty good, but unfortunately I was not impressed.  When they say giardiniera, they basically mean \"a shitload of bell peppers\".  This pizza had WAY TOO MANY toppings on it.  The crust was super thin and could not hold all these toppings.  Even after scraping off about 75% of the veggies, it still wasn't that easy to eat.  The bacon was fine and the kale was just ok.  The mozzarella on this pizza was all wrong, too.  When it first came to the table, it looked like it was a ricotta almost....the cheese was real creamy and thin and almost looked like a white sauce instead of a cheese.  The crust was pretty plain too.  In my other review, I stated that the crust was flavorless.  Pretty much in the same boat this time too.  I LOVE pizza, and I only ate 3 slices of this pizza.  I gave the rest away to a guy down near the stadium.  I think/hope I just chose a bad pie.  My friend ordered the Salsiccia, and I ate a few slices of her pizza.  That one was much better and you could actually pick that one up and enjoy a slice the way it was intended to be enjoyed.  Service from our waitress was on point.  Every staff member I encountered was nice.  I do have one last beef though...and it comes from my first paragraph.  We chose to sit outside on the patio.  I DO NOT recommend that.  Reason?  FLIES!  It was disgusting.  We had our hand in constant motion shooing away flies.  There were a group of 5 flies that would just not leave our table.  It made our meal feel rushed and kind of dirty.  We should have probably asked to move inside....live and learn, right?  Next time, if there is a next time, I will definitely sit inside.    Overall, it was an ok dinner.  The price was right, the apps were great and the service was friendly.  The pizza was just average though and their crust is not my favorite. Those damn flies were really a buzzkill, too!  Will I be back?  I think I might give it one more chance to try out a different pizza or two during happy hour, but that might be it.",

I love enjoying their outdoor patio seating, especially during the great weather months - of which there are too few. Try the pepperoni pizza or the steak panzanella salad - both my favorites! The ambience is super chill and the wait staff are always friendly. The restaurant gets super busy on Friday nights and weekends dinners (rather commonly) so just keep that in mind as they only currently do reservations for larger parties.",

I personally had the 8\" pizza & it was a great meal for one. My favorite part of the pizza was the spicy tomato sauce. I would love to go back to try the seafood linguini & the duck club. So many great options. Only giving a 4-star because even on the slow end of lunch on a Friday our service seemed to be really spotty. But would definitely go back for more!",

Their Duck Club is one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten, the beet salad is super tasty, and I've never been disappointed with any of their pasta. But, until a few weeks ago, I never really gave the pizza a chance. Dang, I've been missing out! Their pizza is so good! I was in Italy a couple of months ago, and this pizza is on par with the pizza in Italy. The crust is thin and crispy, and the toppings and sauces are stellar. I am generally just an extra cheese kind of gal, but my boyfriend ordered a pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms, and now I am hooked. The toppings are just so much better quality than I've had at any other pizza place. We will definitely be frequenting The Parlor from now on!",

    "text": "This place was a fun find near the Camelback Colonnade! Came here with coworkers on a weeknight so we were able to catch happy hour that goes until 6 pm on weekdays. From the outside, this place looks super tiny so I was a bit worried since they unfortunately don't take reservations, but it's actually much roomier inside once than it appears.  From the happy hour menu, we got $2 off white and red sangrias which brings down the price to $6 each. I enjoyed my red sangria very much. We also got the famous cauliflower gratinata (MUST TRY), and their 8 inch pizzas \"the house\" and \"vine ripe margherita.\" The pizzas were good, though not my favorite, but for the happy hour price, I was happy with it. Next time, I will definitely opt for one of the pastas or the burgers.   For dessert, we got the tiramisu. This was soooooo good. If you check in for the first time on Yelp, you get 50% off one dessert so make sure you take advantage of this special!  Parking in the back was small but there's maybe 30+ spots. The customer service was excellent and I truly enjoyed my night here. Will definitely be back!",

Our server (don't even know her name since she didn't offer it) seemed annoyed by us. During this particular dinner venture, we were actually well behaved so I'm not sure what her deal was. Also, the cheesecake was atrocious, cheesecake should not have dark edges and dark top.  But oh well on that. We'll go again but seek different/better service.",

The service left nothing to be desired. The beer and wine selection offered plenty of variety. We ordered a house-special pasta with bacon in it and pizza for dinner; they knocked it out of the park. Pasta with bacon didn't sound appealing to me but it was really good. The pizza may be my favorite in Phoenix. We got chocolate cake for dessert but it was underwhelming and kind of dry. Their other dessert options looked good, so we'll try another option when we have another cheat day. If they offered a Keto crust, I'd be begging to go there every week.",

Overall a decent dish but wouldn't come just for this.   I had also ordered the sausage pizza, which was great. I didn't notice the daily specials board, otherwise I would have ordered some dishes off of there. Loved the crust on the pizza but felt there were too many toppings on the actual pie and weighed it down a bit. By the time you get half way done, the pizza is soggy.",

She was helpful in offering a sample of two wines we were interested in, which helped us make a decision.  We ordered the funghi pizza which was very delicious! The roasted mushrooms were so tasty, the crust was just the right thickness and the goat cheese gave it a delectable taste.  We weren't rushed and was able to have a very pleasant dinner.

After being seated, our very friendly server explained the specials and took our orders. Between the four of us, we ordered olives, Caesar salads, funghi, BBQ chicken and Yukon gold pizzas. Holy schmoly were they good. It is difficult to find crust like that and you can tell they have the right type of oven to make an amazing pie. The large pizza is plenty big for two people and the pizza my husband and I split (the funghi) was ahhhhhmazing. The flavors were bold, rich and oh so satisfying.   The quality of food at this restaurant warrants much higher prices than what they charge. Affordable+delicious+great service = a returning patron.",

It's not only fun but helps me control my portions and is way easier on the dinning budget. I usually ask the server if sharing a meal would also be filling enough to satisfy us and I usually emphasizes...we are starving!  Our server was eager to help us select our dishes.  The Parlor Insalata was a great starter and more than enough for us. It was a large bowl of Mixed Greens/Salami/Feta/Olives/Cucumber/Tomatoes/ Crispy Chickpeas /Red Onion and an Oregano Vinaigrette.  We went with the 12\" Margherita, he wanted pepperoni added to his side of the pizza. He tried one slice without pepperoni and I tried one with. We both agreed all pepperoni next time. Washed it down with a couple beers.  Nom nom tasty.   We were both very pleased with our meals with 3 extra slices left over; I was gifted the take-away box.",

It takes a lot for me to write anything negative about service as a former bartender, understanding the wide variety of people and situations wait staff have to deal with daily. Besides being promptly seated, the rest of the service was terrible. The lady attending to us made it her duty to let us know how busy she was and that she really didn't have time to answer questions. She scowled the entire time at our table and made us feel like our mere presence was lowering the quality of her life.   When my friend asked for some olives before dinner they were never brought out. When our entrees arrived he asked if he might still have them and she brought 4 martini olives on a napkin, dropped them on his plate and walked away. We all laughed because it was just so ridiculous. When our pizza was dropped we noticed our utensils had been taken away with the salad and asked the expo for another fork to which he responded \"I see enough forks for you to share on the table.\" We decided to share a fork because that's how rude the staff was.   Again, food and atmosphere is good, but the wait staff make the experience totally not worth the money. Would much rather go to Cibo, Pomo, or Federal than deal with this sort of service again.",

    "text": "I think I just had the best roasted beet salad of my life ... and who'da thought a pizza parlor, ahem, The Parlor, would have blown me away after a so-called fabulous dinner at a fancy new American restaurant in Houston during Yelp Eats? The Parlor, beet salads across America should bow down to thee.   In town for a Yelp Elite Event, the awesome Gabi K suggested this somewhat new (three months old) pizza place that's garnered such raving reviews on Yelp. Since we're both \"dieting,\" she noted that they have a great selection of salads. I'm in!  The Parlor is a beauty and architecture and design fans will admire the simple clean lines, woodwork, and natural but modern essence of this former beauty \"parlor\" which it still holds True to if you look closely. A lot of the wood (bar and tables) and other pieces were reused from the former beauty salon and reworked into The Parlor. Way to stay Green! This bit of info was given to us by bartender Chris, and yes, Amber W is right. What a cutie. But more importantly, attentive and friendly.  When you walk in, you can choose to go left and sit at a dining table, or go right into the bar area, grab a seat there or at one of the high boys (which seats six). The bar area is where all the magic happened for us on this glorious day...  No one should miss out on the cauliflower appetizer. Forgive me if I get the details wrong, but all I can remember is a steaming hot plate of the healthy vegetable covered and swimming in an Alfredo-like, creamy cheese sauce and sprinkled with more cheese (Parmesan?) and baked to a slight crunch. It's served with toasted focaccia. Yumz.   And the roast beet salad ($9.50) that is *this* close to moving me over to the 602? Think large quarter cuts of orange heirloom beets (which I've never seen before), fennel, avocado chunks, onions and walnut-crusted goat cheese--a generous portion of goat cheese I must add. For $4 more, add the roasted chicken for a protein boost.  And The Parlor is more than just pizza, salads, sandwiches and friggin' good apps. I was also happy to find a cheese and meat menu. With a bottle of red, this would be a perfect date! (And in cooler weather, you can sit out on the patio and snuggle up to the fire pit with your sweetie. Til then, stay inside!)",

    "text": "AWESOME! First time visitor and was not disappointed at all!!  I love it when older buildings are re-purposed. This mid-century modern building used to be a beauty parlor - and is now a pizza parlor! Of course they have other offerings in addition to pizza, but I love how they've kept the 'parlor' theme alive. Anyway, I digress. It was a beautiful evening so we sat outside. I kind of wished we had sat inside because the atmosphere looked great - that and we had a very loud man sitting next to us which was a bit distracting. But I digress.  We started off with the roasted beet salad which was very yummy. I was expecting red beets, but during this visit, they were golden beets. No matter - delish all the same. Practically licked the plate - now that would've been embarrassing! Although the pizza offerings looked good, we created our own. Fresh tomatoes, garlic, sausage, basil, spinach...and it was downright good!  Our server recommended the Paraiso Pinot Noir and she was spot on.    We are anxious to return and try one of the pasta dishes...and more of the Pinot Noir. Great place - and the complimentary valet parking is a bonus.",

Lots of bustling ambient noise to make you feel like you're part of a scene but spaced out enough that you don't have to listen to your neighbor's conversation. Relaxed enough that you can stay a while as well. They've done a terrific job with the design and decor, which contibutes to it's \"chill\" factor.  The food has always been excellent. Even without cheese, these pizzas are stellar. Anything with those roasted wild mushrooms piled on top is worth ordering. They once had a vegan appetizer special that was to die for and I've been waiting for it's reappearance. The wine and cocktails are very enjoyable - and I'm not a cocktail person. These bartenders know what they're doing.   That last star didn't quite make the cut because of the spotty service. Not terrible service, just somewhat inattentive and aloof, though I'm starting to think that's a trend in hip Phoenix restaurants. Overall, I love it here. For the price and the atmosphere, it's a terrific place to spend a few hours chatting up a storm.",

    "text": "In this day and age of many pizza concepts around the valley sometimes it's tough to figure out which one you actually want to visit. For me it really has to be a complete package for me to sit down and spend my hard earned money. In my years of package peeking I think I've become quite the expert and can quickly sum up if it's worth exploring or not.  One part of this package is coifed, bobbed, styled and blown; Salon de Venus was making women beautiful for 58 years in the same location on Camelback and 19th Street.  The star shaped bricks along Camelback are unmistakably Phoenix and remind me of being a wee package peeker growing up in the valley. The new owners Dan and son Aric Mei deserve so much credit for preserving the wall and repurposing many of the items used in the old salon space. Every time we turn around there is something being ripped and bulldozed over to make way for the new with no respect to the old, hats off to them for their thoughtful redesign. What has been done to the new space is simply amazing. The sheer volume and proportion of the main dining room while open, has a sense of coziness and interest with the use of wood and other recycled materials. You can tell that the building is special and well thought out with so many details you can discover something different on each visit.   Since the space is so well designed and inspired, what about the menu? Created by two local chefs, Jared Porter and Jerry Alday, the duo has seemed to have created a delectable menu based on their own experiences using fresh local and seasonal ingredients. There is definitely a sense of this commitment walking up the path to the entrance. They have many of their own herbs, vegetables and citrus growing right there in planter boxes. I even noticed several eggplants growing which I hope to be lucky enough to try on an upcoming visit. While the menu is pizza centric, there is also a varietal of sandwiches, salads and pasta. For the kid-set there is a section just for the younglings to choose from. Aside from Mac and Cheese, this part also includes a B.L.T. for the more sophisticated baby-foodie, how cool is that?  Looking at a great package I like to allow myself to enjoy other more subtle parts of the package, in this case the balls. Arancini ($8) which are big and satisfying balls of creamy risotto, deep fried then served on a bed of pomodoro sauce. These are some of the tastiest balls I've had in ages and are a must when ordering. Having a similar impact is the Cauliflower Gratinata ($7) that uses cauliflower mixed with aged white cheddar cheese and topped with breadcrumbs then roasted. Basically a cauliflower au gratin, it's a delight to scrape some of the baked cheese off the side of the dish and spread onto a slice of grilled bread. For something a little bit different, the Eggplant Cannelloni ($8) uses slices of tender eggplant in place of pasta. The slices are still stuffed with cheese and served on top of Parlors wonderful pomodoro sauce sans the heaviness usually associated with pasta dishes.   On the lighter side, salads are done very well and almost all come in 2 sizes depending on your appetite. On one visit Parlor was actually offering a salad special that was composed of shaved cabbage, Queen Creek Olives, sliced cucumber, cherry tomatoes and cubes of fresh avocado with a refreshingly addictive oregano vinaigrette ($9.50). In a similar preparation, the on menu Parlor Insalata ($6.50) showcases some of the freshest veggies with the addition of crispy chickpeas and salami which both add a heartier dimension to this robust salad.   While the heat coming from the wood-burning oven couldn't be felt, you can imagine the waves of sultry wind as your face closes in on the best part of the package.  Coming in at 8\" and 12\" sizes, you can have it a few different ways, your way or the chef's way. Though why limit yourself to just 8\" when you can have 12\", right? The 12\" is plenty to share between 2 diners with decent appetites since the crust is light and thin. The wood burning oven and the chefs do a great job of combining the perfect yin and yang of slight char and crispy golden perfection, Parlor has some seriously great crust! Yukon Gold Potato ($10/$14) is so simply built its near perfect. Roasted potato, gorgonzola cheese, leeks and pancetta has that sort of down home accessibility you might actually finish a whole one by yourself.   Desserts are treated with much thought here but are kept simple and satisfying. Seasonal Fruit Skillet ($7.50) was much like a fruit crisp that mom would make. Made with the tastiest fruit then topped with a layer of pastry and baked until just right, was only made better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Taking my time with each bite, savoring the quality and preparation, it's the smaller moments in life that can be so memorable. So when you get a chance go ahead, take a peek at that package, you'll never know what you might find unless you look.",

My husband had the Spicy Barbecue Chicken Pizza:  House Made Barbecue Sauce/Provolone/Cilantro/Grilled Scallions/Serrano Chilies.  We shared both pizzas and both were very good.

I highly recommend the meat and cheese plate to start.  We got to choose the items off of a small menu; we decided on  speck, calibrese salami, fenugreek gouda, bratta, and roasted olives.  This anti-pasti was excellent!  Not only were the meat and cheese selections delicious and unique, it came with warm, fragrant flatbread, savory pesto, and sweet pepper compote.  Very filling.  Shortly afterwards, we received our entrees.  I ordered the mushroom ravioli, while the boyfriend got the venison sausage pasta dish.  The in-house made mushroom ravioli was perfectly balanced and savory, with great texture because of the minced chesnut and goat cheese filling.  It sat atop a cheesy bechamel sauce with a watercress garnish.  So good.  The bf wasn't all too impressed with the venison sausage pasta dish, mainly because they broke the sausage into bits, and burned the crap out of it, only to sprinkle it with some breadcrumbs over the handmade pasta.   The portions and prices were just right.  The decor is modern, hip, and cozy.  All in all a good place to eat.",

While we will all admit The Parlor isnt perfect (the potatoes on the pizza were undecooked for example) its strengths far outshine the problems. The cheese plate was fantastic, the pesto was fresh and perfect. The pizzas were scrumptious, and the ambiance was fantastic.  We all cant wait to go back....  PS - we have it from a good source that the burgers here are even better than the pizza.",

Goat cheese, mushrooms and truffle oil!? Yes!  We often come here for a full meal, but there have been more than a few times of coming just for the chocolate cake.  The owner comes into my job a lot and I asked him what was up with the chocolatey delight.  Apparently they spent three months working on the menu. Time well spent sir:)  We have tried a wide variety of their menu items and haven't been disappointed once.  Great wine at competitive prices, tasty house cocktails and a really fun use of space.  They even have a cute little garden outside.  Oh, and free valet!",

    "text": "I love the parlor - it's my new favorite place!!!    I love the mid-century modern decor and love the fact that it has really honed in on what it wants to do (instead of trying to do too many things at once) - with a small menu focused on freshness.  I have been there now 4 times in the past month.    For appetizers I've tried their: Cauliflower (a cheesy, perfectly cooked gratin of sorts, very simple and AMAZING!!!), Calamari (Good), and these fried risotto (I think) balls on a bed of marinara sauce - crunchy and hot on the outside and oozing with cheesy goodness in the middle - AMAZING!!!    The only salad I had (which was a special) was a Herb/Goat Cheese/Melon Salad that was again, AMAZING!!!  I even tried to re-create it at home.  It had watermelon, cantalope, honeydew and  cucumber along with a bunch of fresh herbs (including mint), goat cheese crumbles and slivered almonds in a light watermelon vinegrette.  I know, it sounds a little strange, but was light, summery and absolutely wonderful.  It's a shame it's only a special.....  Regarding pizza: I have tried the Sausage pizza (excellent - with a great spicey sausage - very simple, but delicious), the Ricotta/Arugula pizza (I forget their name for it - but it is really good - I've ordered it twice).  They also have special pizzas and the last time I went there (for my own surprise birthday party) my best friend ordered their special Peach pizza.  I know it sounds weird but it was AMAZING!!!!!  I need to go back when they have it again - white cheese (no tomato sauce) with thin slices of fresh peaches and their wonderful charred crust - it was wonderful......  As for their sandwiches, I've tasted the chicken salad sandwich - really good if you love chicken salad.  With great fries, too!!  Haven't tried any of their desserts but I heard the tiramisu is amazing.....  One negative thing I will say is the service needs improvement (hence the 4 out of 5 stars).  You have about a 50/50 chance of having a good service experience.  My brother and I went there and had a horrible server - my brother even wrote the manager to complain (which meant it was pretty bad).  The guy was good at the actual service part - refilling our drinks, etc., but his attitude SUCKED!!  It's like he was blaming us for the fact that he had to be at this crappy job with these crappy people, etc. (or at least that's what it felt like).  And another time, while the service itself was just okay, our girl didn't seem to know a whole lot about the menu, etc.   But, I've gone there twice and got excellent, friendly service.  So, hopefully they'll work on it.  The food will keep me going back.....   LOVE IT!!!",

    "text": "When it comes to higher end quality pizza and pasta in town this is up there on my list. It's mainly getting 4 stars for food quality and lack of wait time. Unlike other well known pizzerias, my wait was just about 2 minutes. Of course if I had opted to eat inside it would have been a bit longer but not by much. I chose the patio, completely shaded and equip with misters I didn't mind not being in the air conditioning.  After looking at the menu for a good while, I decided to build my own pizza, choosing the wild mushrooms, locally made sausage, garlic and spinach. Just having the option to personalize your pizza is nice. The crust is done well and not soggy. I also ordered up their house salad which comes dressed (while good in hind sight I would ask for it on the side) and especially loved the garbanzo bean garnish, such tasty morsels along with several other fresh ingredients.  The worst thing about The Parlor is the parking. They offer a complementary Valet but it still ends up being a mess as these guys run all over trying to move and park cars while other people are also trying to find parking, which is limited.",

It was noon, the parking lot was full, but we were sat at a booth immediately.   The atmosphere was similar to that of the Vig Uptown, modern but inviting.  I had the Fungi pizza (Assorted Mushrooms, Goat cheese and truffle oil), it was fantastic!  My BF had an Italian sandwich called the Grinder, it was essentially Italian meats and cheeses with giardiniera.   He thoroughly enjoyed it... I'm a vegetarian so I didn't try it.  We also started with some grilled olives from the Queen Creek Olive Mill; they were very tasty and only $2, perfect snack while we waited on our meals.   Definitely give this place a try, it's nothing fancy but a great spot for a casual date or meet up with friends.",

    "text": "Just got back from our first visit to the Parlor.  We were celebrating my 4-year-old's birthday - what better way to celebrate than to introduce him to blue cheese, calamari, and cheesecake all in one night?!  He already knew exactly what he wanted to order, and our sweet waitress was super accommodating and offered to put in his order right away.  She clearly knows how to keep kids and parents happy.    We were surprised by the quality and quantity of the children's spaghetti with meat sauce.  It was fantastic and my son gobbled it up.  Soon after, our order of calamari and rock shrimp arrived.  The grilled lemon was a great addition, and the accompanying sauce was delicious!  Our entrees were the Yukon Gold pizza, sausage/radicchio pizza, and the evening's pasta special: Spring Pea ravioli with a garlic cream sauce and pancetta. Oh MY.  Husband nearly inhaled the sausage pizza, and the one slice I managed to steal from him was full of flavor.  It had sage and a very slight drizzle of balsamic - a great compliment to the other flavors of the pizza.  The Potato/Blue cheese/Pancetta pizza was also good, but not quite as spectacular as the first one.  We were thrilled with the ravioli.  It was light, bright, and spring-y - YUM!  My Mother-in-law couldn't get enough of the sauce, and used her pizza crust to sop up the remainder... no drop was wasted!  We ended with pistachio gelato and the cheesecake with pistachio crust and macerated strawberries on top.  The cheesecake was good and tasted homemade.  I liked the berries and the addition of balsamic.  I was not a huge fan of the pistachio crust however, especially after crunching down on a piece of shell.  All-in-all, the visit was a huge success.  The remodeled interior is lovely, and the inside-outside patio is beautiful.  Our service was spot on, and we really felt welcome (even with a 4-year-old in tow!).  The visit was topped off by our waitress bringing out dessert with a candle in it - obviously having heard our conversation about the boy's bday.  It was a really sweet touch.  We'll be back!!",

I think it's really neat their herb garden is on premise as well.  My fav is the grilled veggie sandwich with the pesto spread.  This is also a great place to lunch with a friend and split one of their pizzas and a salad.  The service is good too.  It's a little loud and some of their items are a little pricey, but the food always tastes fresh.  Way cool that they kept the old barber chairs and pictures of the building back in the day.

It was nice they were running the $20 additional to $100 special at Christmas. I love places that give back to their guests ! I can't wait to go back and try and sandwich if I can ever say no to pasta.   Recommending the classic Bolognese pasta (i get it with spaghetti noodles) and the pizza with fig and prosciutto...name's slipping me right now. I died over their watermelon salad all summer, can't wait to see it again next season. Service has always been up to par each time I've dined.   Thanks The Parlor for being a great go to!",

    "text": "So i've been multiple times now. I wanted to really like this place because so many people do! The pizza is mediocre, at best. With pizza like Pizzeria Bianco, Nook, and much more, I think they are decent, but surely not the best option in the area.    My biggest concern is their service. I seriously can't remember who this guy was but I have had him twice. He is just sarcastic and has an attitude that I can't even understand how a server like him has a job. I worked in the service industry for years and couldn't imagine being as full of myself as this guy. I hate to throw people under the bus like that but it's just unfortunate when you go to a place and expect to at least have a good server and then you put up with a dude like him.  Either way, I am not sure if they have also stopped serving The Alcatraz but this was the only saving grace for me and I've asked for it once and got it. The lady told us that they always serve it on weekends in the evenings and then the guy who was our server the next two times who is listed above, told us that they \"don't do that anymore\". It was delicious and if this is True, I'm not sure I'd ever come back if it is gone.   I'm wishing I could give a better rating but unfortunately, I've been let down.",

We had a BBQ chicken, pepperoni and sausage (can't remember the name but according to our waitress it was voted the 5th best pizza in the country?!).  They were all very good.  Happy hour prices are awesome on drinks and food!  Will definitely go back.  Highly recommend.",

On this particular evening we were lucky enough to get the server Ryan who was not only extremely personable but also well beyond knowledgeable with some great suggestions! The hubby & I always appreciates a great server that is really passionate about his job. After we decided on our choice for our bottle of wine we chose to start with a small sampling of some meat & cheese which the salami & prosciutto was so so fresh, also the pesto sauce was very delish my fave! For my entree I chose the small portion of the freshly made pasta with the perfectly cooked seafood that had just a hint of spice, the dish was perfectly prepared that melted in the mouth. My hubby chose the ricotta cavattelli with the slow roasted pork cooked in a pesto with a touch a spice, can you just say OMG. To finish our meal I couldn't leave without having their to die for moist chocolate cake that's so light, with a berry reduction & some freshly made whipped cream. To go with it we had some limoncello that's also you guessed it, freshly made topped with some Prosecco. What a great evening with our awesome server Ryan & some fantastic food, definitely one of our fave spots for some simple yet freshly made food that never never fails us!!",

The place has a modern look that includes a lot of the original \"hair parlor\" pieces. I guess the host stand is even made from old wood recycyled from the o.g. buliding. Anyway......we ordered the Parlor Insalata and it was great. It has crispy chickpeas and the smaller size was more than enough for the two of us to eat and have extra. We also ordered a pizza with a mix of toppings and it was great. They would not do a half and half and my friend had to pick some things off so that was the only not so fab part of the food. Service was good. I am def going back in the near future.",

Likes: really fresh ingredients (they picks herbs from their own garden for your pizza), great atmosphere, we had a good server- My pizza came out wrong and he was amazing about making up for it.  He brought us a complimentary dessert and took $6 off which was awesome.  He didn't have to go that far- I'm pretty understanding on mistakes but I'm glad he did. Dislikes: serious lack of cheese on the pizzas- I'm a cheese lover though, I tried the pesto pizza and the BBQ pizza and both really lacked flavor in the sauces.  The BBQ was more like ketchup- I would not consider it ketchup.  Some of the server's outfits were shocking.  One of the girls was wearing a hot pink bandana-ganster style and wearing neon hightop sneakers with cut off shorts- I love hip hop more than most but The Parlor is not the place for it. It was just ok I probably won't return unless it were a group thing.  There's better pizza places.",

I've been watching the parlor go up for a while, intrigued by the construction, but hadn't gotten there to eat yet. SO happy we did- cancel your plans for bianco. this is better.   First, the service was so attentive, which was wonderful. We loved the space, which was mostly reclaimed from the original building, as we were told. Its warm, and cozy, and perfect.   We did the smart thing, asking our waitress what to order, and based on her suggestions, split the beet salad and funghi pizza.   Best. beet. salad. ever.  Better then even delux, which was previously my fav. Same for the pizza. You know how artisinial pizza so often falls flat on the crust? I don't want cracker like crust, and I don't want limp dough.   The parlor's pizza dough is perfect. Thin, but doughy and bubbly, baked to a golden perfection. Our pizza featured these fabulous wild mushrooms- it was covered in them, they had great bite and taste. Goat cheese and truffle oil made the flavor mellow and lovely.   The rest was such a success, we couldn't resist dessert- tiramisu. It was scrumptious.   Can't recommend the place enough. I'll be back.",

There are so many great places around here, but I felt like we hadn't been anywhere super impressive until we came to The Parlor :)   A friend of a friend had recommended this spot as one of their favorites, and I'm so glad we took that advice, as we don't choose Italian/pizza restaurants as often as others. For an appetizer, we ordered the Fritto Misto (crispy calamari & shrimp), and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked, and a great portion size as well. We also ordered the Pepperoni pizza for dinner, and it was one of the best pizzas I've had in forever! Huge pepperonis, and yummy chunks of mozzarella all over (I wish I had photos but I was trying to play it cool lol).  In addition to the food I thought the atmosphere was great, The Parlor is a very pretty restaurant! We sat on the patio and I loved it. Our waiter was great as well, he even brought me a sample of a beer he thought I would like when the one I asked for turned out to be no longer available. My one piece of advice would maybe be to skip the drinks all together, though - I thought the food was well priced, but drinks were very expensive so we could have cut our bill in half by just sticking to food!",

The perfect pizza (for me) is basil, garlic, bacon, goat cheese, roasted veg, and arugula. Ohhhh yesss! So wonderful. Just thinking about it right now makes me want to go there immediately. The best part is you can make a small pizza just for yourself and don't have to share with anyone AND it is big enough to have leftovers the next day.... love the leftovers. I think of all the pizza places in Phoenix right now, this may be my absolute favorite....I mean....this place is terrible.....please don't go here so I don't have to wait in line :-D",

Service is friendly and mostly attentive although a bit infrequent (checked on us when we didn't need anything, but when we did was nowhere to be found).  Good wine selection. I got a Bordeaux that wasn't too heavy but with a nice coating in the mouth-feel and paired well. The pizza, though, isn't anything that special for an \"artisinal\" spot, and I get the feeling -- with the soft atmosphere and vibe -- that the place thinks it has better pizza than what it actually does. It's not bad. I got the Margherita pizza, and it was pretty good. It's light and mild but a bit bland, especially the crust. I was expecting a little bit better given that it purports to have the house \"homemade mozzarella.\"  Can we talk about the weird mandatory valet parking? What? Valet for this casual pizza place? I can understand parking getting to be an issue, particularly on weekend nights, but when I tried to park in a lot full of spots on a Tuesday night was told I needed to use the valet service. It gave me a bitter experience heading in. Valet is only needed on peak nights, not ordinary weeknights.",

The pizzas, they deserve not too be described by a self absorbed heathen as I, with such a poor vocabulary. For these cheesed breads are actually compasses disguised as pizzas that point to the gods, old and new! Salads, with their beautiful greens and the fullest flavors. Topped with salami cut from divine swine, but be careful of the chickpeas! When you consume those chickpeas you will never live the same, life will become bland if you do not strive to cook better in your own abode. If you are a man who does not drink booze, then I am most apologetic because you will never know what it's like to suck the froth of a Parlor Star right out of your mustache! Then, Lovage, a test of grit for any True Arizonan! Fear not though, it is a delectable, delicate balance of salty, sweet, and spicy! Cauliflower gratinata, cauliflower gratinata, I do not need to explain one of those most popular dishes to you.  If I had to pick one of each to be my favorite. App: Cauliflower gartinata Salad: Parlor salad Pizza: Calabrian Sandwich: Duck club Try it all with a meat and cheese board.  RIP summer of 2013 and your the ribs on a bed of green beans.",

    "text": "Went in with a few friends the other night.  Our server was nice but I wish he had been a little more enthusiastic when we asked what his favorites were on the menu.  The bruschetta was the best thing we had and we had four courses.  The food was good, don't get me wrong.  My issue was not with the flavor of the dishes (the toppings and seasonings were great) but more so the foundation of the food.  The crust of the two pizzas we had and the texture of the two pastas.  Just was expecting a little bit more of an approach that would set them apart.  Although dessert definitely satisfied my sweet tooth.  Overall I think this place would be great for happy hour and some girl talk and plan to do so again.  The patio is inviting and the ambiance is vibrant.  However, if you are looking for authenticity in the Italian dishes offered, I'd recommend they work on getting back to the basics.",

    "text": "The Parlor has easily become one of my favorite pizza places to visit in the valley.   Pros: As mentioned by other fellow reviewers, the ambience is just perfect - a great place to bring a date! With all hype about the Funghi pizza, I knew I had to try it out myself. If you're a mushroom lover, this pizza is perfect you. The goat cheese and truffle oil perfectly balance the sweetly seasoned mushrooms.   If you're a meat lover, I'd also recommend the Salsiccia. The flavors blended together so nicely, and the sausages had just the right amount of sweet vs. savory. Also, the fact that our waitress was super nice and helpful was a definite plus.  Cons: I don't have much to complain about here. We did try the Tiramisu for dessert, and though it was decent, I don't think I would order it again. The pizzas were the highlight of the meal.  Overall, you should definitely give this place a try! I had a very enjoyable experience here.",

Well, they brought everything all at once and dumped on our table! There was no room on the table, as a result, and they had to take our water glasses off the table. I call that a poor and unprofessional service. I've been there before though, and theydid not have this problem. So, I think it was incompetency of our server (which by the way took no measure to correct the problem or anything, just said she was sorry!). So, it was probably an isolated incident. I will try them again.",

The pizzas are truly gourmet BUT you can get other five star dishes that have nothing to do with pizza as well (superb cheese/meat plates, duck over quinoa, wild fish etc.)  2.  Even though this place is called \"The Parlor\" and a pizza place automatically comes to mind, the atmosphere is nothing like a \"pizza place\" - very nice bar, dining area and garden patio.  I'm not a big pizza fan but this is the best pizza I have had AND their other signature dishes (that have nothing to do with pizza) are excellent.  Great wine list too!",

    "text": "I went in for my boyfriends bday dinner last night and had the worst experience! We were quoted 30 minutes for a table which turned into an hour of waiting. When we were seated, our waitress didn't even say hello, or asked if we wanted any drinks/appetizers. She just dropped off water and left to go make coffee for 15 minutes. We got our drinks 20 minutes after sitting down. When we ordered appetizers, which included a $35 cheese board that wasn't very good, it took another half hour for that. We ordered our food which we didn't get for almost 2 hours after sitting down. Since we waited an hour to be seated in the first place, we were already starving. Since we waited so long the waitress brought out flatbread to tide us over until we received our dinner entrees. Then, come to find out the flat bread wasn't complimentary like she said it was. We asked to speak to the manager which at this point, my boyfriend walked out because he was so outraged by their customer service. The manager (short blond hair) came over to our table and immediately got defensive and told us (the customers) that we were wrong. She also told us \"we don't do bread service here, so I paid for your flat bread out of my own pocket\". The manager then proceeded to call a member of my group, conniving which instantly pissed us off even more than we already were. I explained that customers are always right no matter what and that once we leave she can talk as much crap as they want. I couldn't believe how rude and hostile the manager was towards us. I have never experienced such horrible customer service in my entire life! Also, the food was only mediocre....I wouldn't recommend this restaurant if my life depended on it.",

A little birdie told us to order it special with bacon and blue cheese, and holy crap that isht was GOOD!  Our bartender Tony was also really cool and, despite the place being crazy busy, he was great about letting us taste some of the wines before selecting which ones we wanted. I suspect it might've been because my friend is super hot and was feature dancing while we were in town, but hey, I'm not complaining!  Seriously though, It's the kind of place I'd love to come back to and try the rest of the menu. If for some strange reason I ever end up back in Phoenix, I'll definitely be back at The Parlor.",

My aunt told me about the history behind it, and how they grow their own herbs, and how it was once a beauty shop... so I was kind of excited.   We had a party of 9 so I expected a wait, but an hour and a half is extreme in any circumstance (especially when you're quoted 30 minutes) Apparently they had another large part of 16 who  continued to order round after round of after dinner drinks. That's cool, no need to blame the restaurant, I was excited to give them a fair shot.   First things first, call me old, but this place was LOUD.  The music was about 2 notches above comfortable which caused the drunken party next door to scream, which meant a majority of my family was just silent.   I ordered a glass of Pinot, and I could tell he finished a bottle, and opened another, and mixed them both in my glass. I could take the stale mixed with the fresh. I was disappointed. Also, there was some cork in it. Talk about bad form. They waitress told me it was my imagination. 0_0  My husband ordered the Duck Club, and I ordered the Pesto Pasta (I'm sure they had fancy names, but I did not commit them to memory)   I will hand it to The Parlor, the duck was amazing. (In fact, One of my stars is based completely on the duck!)  Truly spectacular sandwich. The pasta was nothing special. In fact, I was a bit disappointed in the pesto.   The barber Chairs, and vintage photographs were interesting... but the experience felt very... forced. Like they were resting on their Hipster reputation to carry them along.   I might give them one more shot, maybe during lunch when it's quieter, and order the duck myself.",

All pretty amazing restaurants!!! 3 of Americas greatest spots for the tastiest pizzas I have ever had, and I live in the town of Pizzaria Bianco and Humble Pie. I have made thousands of pizzas so I feel qualified to say that The Pizzas I had tonight and other times at The Parlor are the very best!!! Not only are the pies amazing but the Creamy Cheesy Cauliflower, The Panzenalla Steak Salad and any of the Fresh house made Pastas are always spot on. Tonight I dined with my favorite out of town foodies, 2 of which have never been to The Parlor, and I must say that once again everything we ate, touched, drank or spoke to was perfect. I was informed Alice was on her first day of vacation and I must say she left the place in capable hands. The only draw back was half way home we had buyers remorse that we didn't order the Olive Oil Cake or Tiramisu. I hate to raise anyone's expectations this high but I always expect excellent and have always received it. This is still my favorite restaurant in the world.",

    "text": "Went to the Parlor, for my cheat meal. Had a delicious pizza - their fennel sausage is SO tasty and absolutely loved their cauliflower app and my favorite thing was the tiramisu... just an FYI, i am a tiramisu fiend, and when I find a good one- I rave about it. If you want fresh craft pizza, tiramisu that is on-point and an atmosphere that is unique- I highly recommend The Parlor.  They have a great Happy Hour with cocktail, wine, sangria and beer specials, along with food specials for small pizzas, appetizers ( like their yummy calamari).. but what I liked most is the story behind the place. Employees grow a lot of the seasonal herbs in their own gardens and the place itself is a reconstructed 50's hair salon ( if my memory serves correctly). I thought it was so cool that they reclaimed some of the original wood and created the tables and I loved that they put their background story on the tables. It's the little details that made my visit so nice. Keep it up!",

Regarding the pizza, they have one of the best sausage fire pit pizza's in the valley.  They rival Pizzeria Bianco but its one of those nicer places which you should really eat the pizza with silverware instead of using the traditional hand method.  For this reason, it just doesn't feel right.  I normally order the steak panzanella with spicy pecans which is delicious.  The romesco sause, NY grilled streak, and greens is just a perfect fit.  Regarding the environment, its a nice place to relax after a long week at work.",

There were three of us, and we each got the soup special of the day (salmon chowder). I was skeptical, I like my salmon either smoked or sushi raw, but this was delicious! My the soup was served with a slice of foccacia bread.  We split the beet salad and the pesto pizza. The beet salad was refreshing. The only thing i would do differently is have the goat cheese ball (served on the side of the salad) warmed up. Nothing beats warm goat cheese! The pesto pizza was great as well! Had that nice brick-oven-taste to it (thin crust -not burnt, not too thin). This would be a great place for a 1st date luncheon, business lunch, etc!",

They also have your basic Margarita and pepperoni both are amazing as well.  If you come during lunch you'll be waiting a while to sit in the dining area.

Or is the happy hour reduced price pizza \"lesser\" than the full price one?  Service was quite good for our very large group.  Not having to valet at the time we arrived was a relief.  I'd be willing to give them another try if someone wanted to go here though.  Personally, though, I'll be sticking to Federal (drive-through pickup!)...or Bianco (on Camelback) or North (ugh, parking) if I am feeling fancy.",

    "text": "Living in walking distance to this place, I often overlook it when choosing a restaurant for dinner. Living in Phoenix it's easy to get caught up in the new restaurant hype and forget about the good standbys. Luckily for me, my sister was in town and asked to come here for dinner since is was 5pm on a Friday and neither of us wanted to sit in traffic just to try something else. When we got to the restaurant we were seated immediately which surprised us since it was happy hour on a Friday. The patio doors were open so even though we were sitting inside we were able to enjoy the beautiful spring weather outside.   We started off with a couple glasses of wine which were each $2 off for happy hour and the Fritto Misto which was $5 for happy hour. The wine was very good. They have a decent wine selection and it's not a terrible deal at $2 off.  The Fritto Misto was lacking in a little flavor but it wasn't bad. For dinner we ordered the happy hour pizzas which were $7.99 each. This is definitely the best deal for happy hour. You get a full sized pizza that is more than enough for one and almost big enough to split depending on your appetite. We ordered the Pesto Pizza, The Pepperoni Pizza, and the Cheese Pizza (for my son). They were all very good! And not just good for being happy hour. I had forgotten how well they make their pizzas! In fact I'm kicking myself for not going here more often.   The service was also excellent. Towards the end of our meal it was starting to get busier but the wait staff seemed to be keeping up with the demand. The restaurant is also very kid friendly. I noticed quite a few people had young children so if you're looking for a child friendly restaurant, I would definitely recommend The Parlor. I will definitely be back and look forward to trying more of their menu items.",

After being seated outside on the patio, it took a good ten mins to get our waitress(we had to ask for).   We started with the \"soup of the day\" (believe it was potato cube soup\" and shared a 12' Salsiccia pizza - The food was beyond great! Nice thick crust.  To wash down the delicious pizza I order my favorite beer(kilt lifter) and she had a cucumber majito.   They have such a nice romantic patio dining area with a fireplace. Great place to bring someone you care about.   Note: in my books - Great Food and drinks don't make up for the poor service. Poor service for me kills restaurants.   KCYE",

I've heard so many good things about this place so I was expecting greatness, but worried I would be disappointed due to all the hype.  I was not disappointed.  I am going to rank The Parlor fourth on my favorite pizza places list in the Valley of the Sun, but I can see it possibly moving up a notch or two after more visits.  I'd like to give The Parlor 4.5 if I could.  I had a sausage pizza with garlic and basil.  My girlfriend had a pepperoni pizza with garlic and basil.  Both were outstanding.  The sauce was great and the cheddar and mozzarella mix was very nice.  Next time I think I'll get a pizza with pepperoni and sausage with garlic and basil.  Another nice thing, they don't charge for the fresh garlic and basil (or any other herbs), unlike some of my other favorite Phoenix pizza places.  The overall prices were very reasonable for a 12\" pie.    I definitely plan on becoming a repeat customer of this fine establishment and it won't take me months to do so.",

    "text": "IF heaven came on a pizza crust, The Funghi pizza would be IT!  This is only my first visit, but I anticipate many more visits in my future-there are just too many yummy things on the menu.  I'm guessing that this 4 star review will get upped to 5 in short order (pun intended there)  Anyway, we went on a Thursday night right around 6:45 and the restaurant was a beehive of activity-but in a good, happy vibe kind of way.  As usual within a 5 mile radius of my house, there was no parking and the valet was the only option.  I'm getting used to this, but it still bugs me a teeny bit.  As you walk in, you walk by a raised  herb and vegetable garden that looks AMAZING.  Then you get inside, and the ambiance is somehow perfect.  Relaxing, yet modern is how I would describe it..  The patio seating is lovely, but this is one of those restaurants where there really isn't a bad seat in the building-there is even counter space at the kitchen so you can watch them cook.  So far, without tasting anything or going to inspect the bathrooms, it's looking like a 5 star experience.  It's SO nice in fact, that I start seriously worrying about my wallet and whether or not I can afford to eat here.  I found myself trying desperately to remember what 2 dollar signs means in actual money....  So the water and the menus came, and I got a lovely surprise.  An 8 inch specialty pizza for $10?  Great!  A house infused lemoncello for $6?  Good!    We ordered a margharita pizza, the funghi pizza, the bruschetta, some olives, and a couple of the lemoncellos (actually I had the grapefruit 'cello) for $44 plus tax and tip.  For the quality of the food, I actually think the prices are very reasonable.  The bruschetta tasted amazing.  It's embarrassing, but we were moaning and mumbling while eating it-luckily, the tables aren't crowded together and no one heard us.  The olives were local and rosemary infused, so no complaints there either. Then the pizzas came. OH. WOW.  'nuff said.  if visit 2 is as good as visit 1, this place is 6 star pizza nirvana.  I'll keep ya posted!",

    "text": "Solid restaurant close to the airport in Phoenix.  It looks a lot sexier at night.  I came just as the sun was setting, but when I left in the dark, I was very impressed with the look and feel of the restaurant.  I came for a business meeting and although the restaurant was a tad bit loud, I didn't have to shout at the clients I was hosting for them to hear me which often happens at restaurants in the US.  Not being from the area, and basing my decision purely on Yelp reviews, my fellow yelpers didn't disappoint.  The server wasn't very knowledgeable on wines which was a tad bit disappointing, but was otherwise very accommodating and knowing we were in a meeting, was courteous and only interrupted at pivotal times to take our order, bring us our food, etc.  I was very appreciative of it.  The clients both ordered a pizza for themselves and did a pretty good job polishing off nearly the whole thing.  Between the two pizzas ordered, they only had 3 slices left.  I had a small plate spaghetti pesto pasta dish which was extremely flavorful and just the perfect amount for it's size.    Prices are completely reasonable as well.  Is it the number one pizza place in Phoenix?  I don't know.  I didn't actually try the pizza, but what I like is that they weren't the American standards of veggie, meat lovers, ham & pineapple, etc.  These were rustic pizzas with new ideas for toppings.  I'm not opposed to coming back and trying, but for now, Pizzeria Bianco in downtown Phoenix still has my heart.",

The crust had no flavor to it, it was a bit over cooked, the sauce didn't have much flavor and the taste with all the toppings was very bland.  Not a good experience  Those with me seemed to really enjoy themselves and truly liked what they got. With myself I would have rated two stars but I increased it because everyone i was with might have rated 4.  So don't get the pizza.    The service was excellent.  They really did a nice job of taking care of us  But no",

We had a big party but it was worth the 45 minute wait since we all went to the bar for drinks waiting to be seated. Bartenders were extremely friendly. Our server was great and always checked on us. We started out with the meat platter which was outstanding! My daughter got her spaghetti immediately which I thought was such great customer service! Hungry kids should eat first! I had a small spicy bbq chicken pizza and it was bursting with so much flavor I couldn't wait for the next bite! And then the tiramisu for dessert...probably the best I've ever had!!! Sorry dad ;)",

We had to wait almost an hour because the big party before us sat there chatting with their food all boxed up for 45 minutes, but this is in no way a reflection on the restaurant, just a warning! The food was amazing, our waitress was very nice and gave me a super good tip about the squid ink pasta being overly fishy so I avoided getting something I definitely wouldn't have liked. I got the pappardelle bolognese instead (not a big pizza fan) and it was absolutely incredible. I spent 3 weeks in Italy this year and the pasta from this restaurant rivaled some of my meals there. The kids' meals came out quick and the drinks & desserts were to die for. Plus, the atmosphere is really nice! Will definitely come back here the next time I'm in Phoenix.",

From the warm inviting atmosphere to the friendly service and especially the fresh and delicious food, you can't go wrong with a visit to the Parlor.  On a recent visit, we celebrated my father-in-law's 71st birthday, so the age range in our group was from 5 to 71 and everyone was able to find something and had a great experience.  The Parlor's kids menu offers pizzas and pastas and there is plenty of variety on the main menu from fabulous appetizers (do not miss the cauliflower), salads, pizzas, pastas, an incredible farro dish, and plenty more.  They also offer a solid wine and drink menu and desserts too.  I recommend the banana pudding ;)    Looking to save a few $$?  (Who isn't!)  Plan to visit between 3 and 6 during happy hour.  Excited to return soon and often... just wish they took reservations!",

Pinot Grigio and pepperoni pizza with basil and drizzled pesto sauce. After travelling a lot, I'm home for one night tonight before a flight in the morning and have been craving Parlor Pizza. Was acknowledged and sat at the bar for a bit in front of a stack of menus before water was offered. The bar was wet and I was given a wet menu. I wiped everything down, ordered my wine and put in my pizza order. Bar wasn't busy but got the 'closing soon' feeling. Closed my tab, got my pizza and started on my 5 minute ride home. When I grabbed the box to get out my car, my fingers were greasy then noticed so was my car seat!!!!!!! Grrrr..... Grabbed Starbucks napkins I had in my car and it soaked thru 3. Opened the box and the pizza was so greasy and so was the entire box. 'Napkined' the grease off of two slices , ate them and tossed the rest. Disappointed and dissatisfied. The Parlor was off their game tonight ... boooooo.",

The margarita pizza was pretty good but could have been better if the crust was good a bit longer. The kale sweet potato salad was really delicious and had awesome flavors! The tuna melt was blah- I've never had a tuna melt but I love cold tuna salad A LOT. It lacked flavor and was only cooked halfway through, so the middle was cold ... not exactly a melt but the fries were bomb! Our service noticed we didn't eat the sandwich and even though we said it was fine, he took it off our bill which was really great customer service and we appreciated it a lot. THANKS BRENT!",

We ended up spending more on coffee than beer.  That wouldn't be an issue, except our waitress wasn't the most attentive and took almost 10 minutes to bring back creamer.  So when we drank the coffee, it was both luke warm and had grounds at the bottom.    The salad portion is small.  Don't order it as an entree.    I ordered a pizza with mushrooms and goat cheese which was great.  All of the pizza on the table was delicious and some of the best pizza I have had.    We gave the waitress a 10 minute limit.  Between the table, we said we would order dessert if she came back in 10 minutes.  However, it was nearly 15 before she came back so left.    In short, the pizza is great but we did have a poor experience with service.",

The staff was very friendly and helped us sort out the customizable menu and what to choose on our chef's board.   To start, we shared the chef's board with a spicy meat (I forget the name) and a spreadable lighter cheese (also forget the name). This was super delicious! I loved what we chose and what it already came with (bread, dips, veggies). I also got the Margherita pizza which was great! I got the smaller size and I still had a couple slices to take home.

After an hour and 15 minutes of waiting a server comes out to tell us he can't sit us all together after waiting this long. It is absolutely ridiculous. If you plan on coming with a big party, don't because clearly they don't know how to manage their seating, or wait times. Thank you for the awesome service.",

Came here for GNO and different items were ordered among the table. Pizzas, salad, burger, cauliflower app, and dessert.  The service was great, the waiter was knowledgable about the menu and pronounced all the food items well. The waiter was attentive and nice. The only thing I can think of was, my water wasn't refilled the whole time I was there. But the great service made up for that. Everything we ordered was full of flavor and unique! It was nice to go somewhere and just order new things. The summer corn pizza was amazing!! Full of spice and flavor and different that any pizza I've had lately.  The dessert was yummy with a delicious lemon curd sauce on the side! This place is defiantly worth a try!!",

    "text": "I'm clearly a New York kinda pizza guy and not a huge fan of those fu fu toppings and fancy small pizzas, but my date loves this place so I took one for the team. It was a Friday night just after 8pm, but because of the Holiday weekend we got seated right away. After we switched tables, we ended up on the patio where the active misters doused our table and the paper make your own menus and even gave both of us a somewhat wet head. It was the only way to go though and the alternative was shouting out to get to know this woman in the very loud interior room. Service was great, the waitress was very patient and since there was no wait, we were allowed to linger until closing. I had some refreshing seasonal peach beer at $5 a pop, while she went with the rather pricey $9 a glass wine. As for the food, we just had the arancini (rice balls) which were slightly above average, but resting in a nice semi spicy marinara sauce that was well seasoned ($9 for three). The make-your own pizza at $9 plus $2 each for toppings turned out good enough with artichoke hearts and grilled veggies and a blend of cheeses. Of course, NY'ers prefer just mozzarella, but had to roll with the punches. Good news was that it was foldable and even if it wasn't, no fork would ever get near my slice anyway. We just hit this place on a nice relaxing night and everything really was quite satisfactory, including my date for a change.",

We had 3 pizzas- the classic pepperoni (yuuuum), the potato-leek (amazing!!!) and the fungi (I don't eat mushrooms, but my friends thought this was great) Can't wait to visit Arizona again to come here again....especially for those lentils!",

    "text": "I really don't get how people love this place. My first time, I went with a group and we all ordered pizzas. Each person ordered a different pizza and I tried them all. Not sure what's going on with the oven but everyones crusts were soggy. I had the pizza with speck on it which was cool to have on a pizza but it was pretty pricey. Plus having to pay for valet meant more money to shell out!   I wanted to give this place another try so I went again with two friends who brought me the first time and needless to say, same old story.... I emailed The Parlor before to ask of they had any gluten free options and I received an email stating the servers were very well trained in guiding me through the gluten free options on their menu. Would've been nice to just be told what was available rather than making me drive there to ask. I joked around with my friends saying the waitress will just tell me they have salads (I'm not driving all the way there to order a basic salad) so I ordered a pizza again. This time I used the sheet to make my own creation which ended up costing me $25 for a 12 inch pizza and they were skimpy on the ingredients plus I didn't order anything fancy. My crust again was soggy like last time and so was my friends who just ordered cheese pizza. How can you screw up the crust of a cheese pizza?!? I asked the server after we got our pizza what their gluten free options were only to have her say, we have salads? Totally nailed it!   When I left the restaurant, I realized I forgot cash to tip the valet guy. When he dropped off my car, he put his hand out for a tip which completely appalled me. I grabbed my keys and left while he complained to his coworker about me where I could hear him. I still felt bad and ran to the gas station across the street and got cash back and brought a tip to the guy. Needless to say, I will never step foot in this place ever again. I can get a top notch pizza from La piazza locale or pizzeria Bianco for cheaper than the parlor, no valet needed and a real deal crust that isn't soggy.",

We also ordered the duck sandwich and lasagetta.  Duck sandwich was a bit too sweet for me, nothing super special I can say about it.  Lasagetta ... turned out NOT to be lasagna as we thought..it was little sausage pieces that covered veggies and thick lasagna pasta.. no sauce, no go if you ask me.  I would definately come back for the pizza!",

The staff is amazing, you couldn't ask for better people...and the food?  Well - lets just say I crave so many of the items on the menu it would seem like I was getting paid by them if I rattled off all the amazingness here :)  I will say that Michael hit a home run with the Parlor Star cocktail.  It's my new favorite!!  (and I never go for gin drinks...ever)  You have to check this place out!!  Happy Hour is great! The 1/2 price appetizers will get you hooked and the portions are so large will fill you up!  But be sure to leave room for the pizza!!  It doesn't matter which one you choose - they're all awesome!  Pair it with the Parlor Insalada and you're set!  Happy Eating!!",

The dough is made with beer giving a light, fluffy, and chewy texture. Cooked perfectly, mozzarella was the right amount of salty and creaminess. The pepperoni had great flavor, not to greasy or salty. We also ordered the bolognese with fresh in house made pappardella! The pasta was perfectly done and cooked. My wife's sauce is better but they did a good job. Only getting three star because of the all around service. We had to ask several times for the wine chiller and the staff was not very attentive during the course of the meal. We finished off with pineapple Zeppole  and this came out piping hot with a delicious caramel sauce and side of whip cream. All in all we will go back.",

It is a cute little place and like most places in the area the parking lot is TINY; practically minuscule so you have to get their valet or sneakily park next door. Just to let you know --I would not recommend that because I freak out that my car will get towed but ours did not. You run the risk if you try it though.   Now for the food. We split two burgers. I had the bleu cheese+bacon w/salad and Mr. had the brie+mushroom w/fries. OMG. I think I may have made an inappropriate face for the dinner table when I took my first bite. It was that delicious. The hamburger is juicy, the lettuce is spring greens (looks like its from the garden -adorables) the bread is perfectly toasted to accommodate the medium rare burger and there was just the right amount of bleu cheese so it wasn't overpowering.  French fries were surprisingly delicious - I don't know what seasoning they put on there but I ate more than I normally would in that department.   Ambiance: We sat on the patio and it was extremely cute, feels indoor/outdoor which I adore. Another place that I want to steal the decor/design from.",

Wonderful options for building your own pizza or if you're a little more adventurous they have their own creations that are fantastic as well.

What more can you ask for? I certainly recommend trying the funghi pizza with a fresh farm salad to compliment. With dinner, we shared a very reasonable bottle of Boom! Boom! and topped everything off with a table side french press for two.   I can't express how much we enjoyed our experience at The Parlor. They have made a customer for life!",

The style is very modern and sleek...I love the open-ness of the room, nice little herb garden as you walk in.  The food is solid - the soup was a potato/sausage when we were there, made with a veg stock rather than a cream base, which made the soup a perfect accompaniment rather than an overbearing, heavy soup.  It was delicious and still fairly light.    We had the spicy bbq chicken pizza, which was nothing like a CPK BBQ chicken pizza - it was great.  The sauce is not over-done and is quite light in comparison.  The spice comes from the peppers that are sliced up as a topping - really pretty light on the spice (I could've used more, but this was probably an appropriate for most people Level of spice).    Overall, service was good, food was good, decor was good...for some reason, I just didn't love it.",

Had a great time -- got to sample several different pizza's and were impressed by the quality of ingredients used in the toppings -- I loved the sage and sausage combo, and that fact that the pepperoni was actually spicy! Can't say we were blown away by the crust, but it's inauspiciousness allowed the amazing toppings to shine.    We were also impressed with the remodel of the space, in particular the desire to stay True to the mid century bones of the space, while adding a modern, yet organic edge. I loved the reuse of the salon chairs as bar stools, and the vintage photos of the salon next to the washrooms...   One last thing, not sure it was intentional or not, but we enjoyed the $7 pitchers ($2 pints) of PBR -- it brought back fond memories of college.",

Now on to the food, the menu is affordable, not cheap, I like the cheese and meat boards concept, although I realize when they say hard cheese, they mean HARD cheese, next time I'll go do something a bit softer.  The Peach and Gorgonzola special of the night was a fantastic parring for my Summer Ale.  I look forward to being back for many more samplings.",

The toppings on the pizza were really good but I didn't like the crust.  That's not to say it tasted bad or was made incorrectly, I personally wanted (or \"prefer\" may be a better word) a slightly thicker crust. I'm not going to be an asshole and say the whole thing sucked because it wasn't my personal preference.  I think other people may like the thinness of the crust, and I'll just leave it alone.

    "text": "To those as sick of going to LGO Pizzaria as me:   It was so wonderful to walk into one of our small architectural treasures that hasn't been torn down, but actually adaptively re-used and re-imagined into a gorgeous, warm yet contemporary eatery.  I can't stop talking about the ingenious curtain wall of glass that allows the filtered light from the geometric concrete shade wall to gently glow into the interior.  On my first visit, I wasn't feeling very adventurous , so I ordered the pepperoni and mushroom pizza with torn basil, and as pedestrian as that sounds, it  was simply the stand-out of the evening.  I loved all of the salads, but thought the Cesar Salad too salty for my tastes.  The creamy fettucini pasta I tried was scrumptious!  I tried another creamy pasta dish, but it had some raddichio in it that overwhelmed the delicate creamy identity. The anitpasto (going backwards here) was super satisfying and diverse.  I appreciated the dipping sauces, and the hard to pronouncecured meats and delicious cheeses that our waitress was sweet enough to repeatedly pronounce for all of us approaching our 3rd or 4th glass of wine.     I love that the coffee came in our very own little red French Presses, and that our waitress, when hearing the despicably dirty jokes being tossed around the table, chimed in with a few from her own repertoire.  The 2nd time was at the bar, and the bartender didn't cut the muster for me.  He was slow, and we had to ask him repeatedly for simple things like silverware and water.  The food was just as excellent... my new favorite pizza spot for sure!",

    "text": "If Heaven exists, what do I want to hear God say as I arrive at the Pearly Gates?  \"...and we're catered by The Parlor...\"  Have been there only five times now (or is five a lot?).  It's literally a mile from home, which makes The Parlor really too accessible.  Friday and Saturday nights are a tad busy for us \"regulars\" (probably not a regular by any means, but most reviews seem to come after the initial visit, whereas we have returned again, and again, and again.  So there!  I'm calling us regulars.)  The True and final crescendo of all our Parlor experiences came last week when my mom, who was visiting from Michigan, mentioned she wanted to take us out for dinner.   First, the back story:  Originally she was talking steak, but as our entourage included a 7-year-old, Durant's just didn't seem like the best idea.  I had seen children at The Parlor on every other visit and verified on the website that there was indeed a \"Bambinos\" menu.  PB & J at The Parlor?!?!  SOLD!  Why should parents be relegated and alienated to only the restaurants that have playgrounds, arcades, or where any and all food is given some sort of completely ill-fitting adjective (How \"happy\" is this meal, really?  What exactly makes a fry \"zany\"?)  With news of PB&J and Leapster in hand, the child was attended to and satisfied.  Back to that crescendo...my fiancee, who is Italian, ordered The Smokey, I the Puttanesca, and my mom the Pappardelle Bolognese.  Of course we all have to try eachother's, right?  Upon trying the Bolognese, my fiancee, the Italian, raised by an Italian mother in an Italian kitchen said, \"This is the closest to my mom's that I've ever had in a restaurant.\"  Please queue the \"Halleluia Chorus.\"    So yes, this is as good as it gets.  Maybe only two other authentic pizza places in the greater Phoenicia even bear mentioning beyond The Parlor.  Trust me, People.  I'm dealing with the offspring of the 70 year old female equivalent of Mario Batali.  \"Easy to cook for\" is not a descriptor of this man I love.  My one, only, minor, teeny weensy complaint:  Bring back the original Zeppole!  Although our dear waiter assured us the addition of the orange inside each Zeppole and the change from chocolate to salted caramel dipping sauce was an improvement, I'd have to disagree.  Can we get them sans orange?",

The pizza was burned but it tasted great.  Had a spicy cocktail with Serrano chili pepper infused tequila!  Wow.  The price was $30 for two drinks and a pizza for two",

The ONLY drawback is the extremely small parking lot, part of it which is shared with the neighboring bar, so try not to be too fashionable and late or you'll be walking a country mile.",

    "text": "The Parlor is a hip spot.  The beer selection is legit, the place is clean and furnished nicely, and the staff are great.  Since this place is a pizza spot and has some clout to it's name, I had to check it out.  Pizza is type of food that requires absolute attention to detail in it's execution to cross the line from good to excellent. It doesn't matter how many awesome topping combinations you can come up with, it must come down to the core of the pizza itself, as you could just throw those toppings on a sandwich with the same results if the fundamentals of the pizza aren't nailed.  This is where the parlor falls short.  When I roll into a pizza spot like the parlor, I always go for the Margherita.  It's super simple, so unless it's prepared by a deft hand, it will be average; however, if it is prepared by someone with some skills, it will blow your mind how incredible such a simple pizza can be.  ...So, I went for the Margherita and I was not impressed at all.  The crust is unexceptional.  The overall flavor of it was reminiscent a place like Barro's, under salted, a little sweet from something like sugar or honey added in, and maybe even some oil.  True masters can take Flour, Water, Yeast, and Salt and put together a crust that will peal your lid off.  Also, the hydration was pretty low, I'd say 50-55%, which means they have their ovens at lower temps.  My crust was just barely cooked though, with no real color or any char on the cornicione.  It was just spongy and bland, which is not the launch pad for amazing pizza.  The toppings, the toppings... I think of Marlon Brando's character from Apocalypse Now saying this.  This Margherita is a disgrace.  They just put sliced heirloom tomatoes on this thing.  I love heirloom tomatoes, but this just irks me on three levels:  1. Sliced tomatoes on pizza that aren't par roasted just piss water all over the pizza.  2. For it to be a Margherita they're traditionally supposed to be blanched then hand crushed. I'm not some type of stickler for rules, but if you're going to go rogue, you gotta make it amazing. Adhereing to the crushing of the tomatoes, with the insane high heat of the oven (which this place doesn't have), will create these cheese/tomato chimera areas of wonder.  These of course did not exist in regards to the Parlor's Margherita.  3. Without the crushing of the tomatoes, there was no sauce like vehicle to separate the crust and cheese, and I didn't really detect any Olive Oil in there like a white pizza has.  Beyond tomato-gate, the house Mozzarella is uneventful at best, and sprinkling Mozzarella on top of the tomatoes as well is just a waste. It falls right off due to the inherit moisture in the tomatoes and reminds me of something a slice shop would do when they reheat a slice in the oven.  This Margherita gave me some insight into the Parlor.  They are either, unwilling or totally oblivious to the fact that at the core, their pizza is rubbish and they're just throwing high grade toppings on it to cover that up.  One 700 ft drive up the street to Bianco in Town and Country would give them some serious education in how to kill a Margherita on every level.  I see it like this, either they're negligent or incompetent in regards to pizza.  I don't care if this place's \"{Inset Name Here}\" pizza is really good, because they're just shrouding amateurish pizza with clever toppings.  There are many other places around the city that have put some real time in to getting everything right with their pizza besides what they put on it.  If you're thinking about going here, do yourself a favor and move along down Camelback to 20th and hit up Bianco at Town and Country.",

A fondue like sauce at the bottom of the plate + roasted cauliflower topped with bread crumbs and served with a garlicy bread --- so good! The fritto misto wasn't just calamari which was a happy surprise. I think there were also pieces of juicy shrimp! The arancini sadly was my least favorite if they had to be ranked but it was still really delicious! Crunchy on the outside and gooey in the middle served with a really good marinara sauce. Also order two pizzas: roasted corn and the potato one. Both were good but I have to say I've decided that I don't like rosemary all that much so the potato one wasn't my favorite.  I have to talk about the roasted corn one though! Creamed corn with roasted corn on top to with roasted jalapenos (I think... something was spicy) the spice and sweet totally balanced each other out and was super delicious! I'll definitely be coming back!",

Upon entering, I felt a little awkward in my hiking clothes when I saw many of the patrons dressed casually but more chic, with many in business clothes.  The ambiance is exactly that.  Casual yet chic.  We ordered the Fritto Misto to start with.  It is crispy calamari and shrimp.  I found it very tasty, its something I would order again.  For pizza we tried the procuitto cotto.  I thought it was okay.  The flavor was good, but the kind of good that was just passable.  It was borderline bland.  Perhaps it was overcooked because the crust seemed a bit overdone and was pretty tough.  I looked at the pictures other yelpers have posted, and their pizza crusts look wonderfully light brown with slight charring.   Service was efficient.  No problems there.  My first visit was just okay, but if I come back I plan on ordering another type of pizza.",

The good news: during my recent visit I confirmed this server no longer works here and my experience was far superior.   EXPERIENCE (past): I decided to give this place another try after spending years avoiding it after my terrible experience when it first opened: I went out on a limb and took my father here for dinner--who was in from out of town--based on other Yelp reviews. Sadly, the food fell short, and the service TERRIBLE. When a co-worker suggested this location for lunch, while hesitant, i agreed.  EXPERIENCE (update): Clearly my earlier experience was a mixture of \"just opened\" jitters and a server who had no business serving me. I was pleasantly surprised with the lunch experience (i still have to go back for dinner...) and everything about this go around certainly created urgency to come back.  FOOD: The calamari and shrimp appetizer was good--nothing special, the baby spinach salad was delicious--not over dressed and fresh ingredients, and the french press coffee and the pear/apple tart was divine!! I would go there to sip their french press and eat that dessert any day...seriously, so good.  SERVICE: The service was impeccable. Our server was informative, so friendly, and was very attentive--wasn't at our table too much or too less. The fact that I never had to prompt my server for a refill was amazing. This doesn't happen very often in my experience. I would call him out by name, but would hate for this POSITIVE review to be removed by the Yelp folk :)  All in all, a very solid lunch experience. Don't disappoint me at dinner, though. I'll be back :)",

The decor, mood, and lighting were excellent. What a great fresh looking restaurant.   The few beers they had we're solid choices. I had a dark red beer that I had never had . Surely Delicious. I had the Spicy Seafood Linguini. The ingredients we're fresh, great presentation. But it was bland, not spiced at all. Looking for Garlic, or even salt. I had to add some. It looked amazing, but lacked in flavor.   I would come back and try something different for sure. The rest of my party had a Fungi Pizza (loved it), A Salad (loved it), Duck Risotto (thought it was okay), Plain Risotto (Bland, no flavor)  Thanks!",

The service is always top notch and the cleanliness of The Parlor is always noticed. Side note: I love the herb garden at the entrance! Nice touch.  However. This last trip I decided to order something other than pizza. Starting off with Halibut Crudo, I would not wrap my brain around all these strange flavors that should not be on the same plate. Radish, corn and halibut. Too contrasting. And corn is just too sweet! A very odd dish that left me frowning.  Next was a very-difficult-to-eat burger. I ordered the bacon and gorgonzola burger and was dismayed at the bullet-like pickles in the sandwich. They poked up through the bun! Aren't pickles supposed to be cut into thin disks? Not these. These suckers made their presence known, and I had to pick them out of my sandwich.   I'll come here again, but I'm going to stick with what I know: Their pizza. Buon appetito!",

I visit this place regularly for lunch or dinner and they never disappoint.  When it comes to why this place is amazing I will say it's the DETAIL.  They have a very good design inside, just awesome use of an old bank and the remodel is just amazing.  Finally the food needs to be just as good!   They have a starter plate option that consists of choosing your favorite seasonal selections of cheese and meats.  I have to say I was super bummed when they switched things up from Spring but the new selections have been great.  They have great vegetarian options but their strengths are in the homemade pasta and their meats.  I have had the Ribs on a weekly special and they just melted in my mouth.  They have some variations of specials throughout the week where they try to create themes and I have been blown away by their approaches to different dishes.    Then there is the pizza, again my favorite thin Neapolitan style that can be found more and more in Phoenix.  I have always commended Pizzeria Bianco and Cibo near town but now the Parlour is right there with them. Bravo!",

    "text": "I give The Parlor a hesitant 4 stars, and I only do so because I wish I could give it the 3.5 stars it deserves.  The food is pretty hit or miss. We started with the Chef's Board, a create-you-own and pay-as-you-order charcuterie plate. We ordered the Spanish \"drunken goat\" cheese, a soft brie, some kind of ham, and olives. The meat was overpriced; four slices of meat for $4? Sliced thinner than paper, I felt pretty ripped off. Let me tell you, as an avid goat cheese fan, I was really looking forward to some nice chevre infused with red wine. My disappointment was partly my fault, partly False advertising. Be warned: a Spanish goat cheese has more the consistency of a cheddar than a True soft, spreadable, slightly crumbly goat cheese. I could forgive my own ineptitude if my \"drunken goat cheese\" hadn't been sober as a judge. The flavor was most definitely \"eh\" for $4 for a measly little slice. The brie was good, but still not worth the $4 you pay for the serving. The plate came with pita bread that was unevenly cooked (inedibly crisp in places and delightfully soft in others), a slightly sweet salsa, a hot pepper dip, and (the highlight of the plate) a garlic pesto that was amazing. However, as amazing as the pesto was, it wasn't worth the price of its mediocre companions.  Next, we had the \"small\" Caesar salad for $8 that was decent, but nothing special. I'm really not sure I can say anything else about it because it was simply a Caesar salad.  The pepperoni pizza. Big, tasty slices of pepperoni on soft crust with torn basil on top? Delicious. Worth the money, absolutely. Add some red pepper flakes because, trust me, it makes it 100x better.  The service was slow, admittedly. We waited a half hour to get our Chef's Board, then another 15 minutes or so between the salad and the pizza. However before I imply any resentment toward the waitress, she did, at the end of our meal, recognize that service was slow and that we were dissatisfied with the Chef's Board, so she offered to buy us dessert. We declined, but the gesture was all we needed to feel better about the meal.  Absolutely go and check out The Parlor, but be aware you may have to wait (for both table and service) and keep one eye on your wallet, as they might try to steal more of your hard-earned wages with their overpriced food.",

Started with  the meat and cheese plate. It was nothing special and I wouldn't order it again. Ordered 3 pizzas to split. All of them were good. Fresh toppings, good dough, good cheese.   Once seated drinks took ~10 minutes to get, then another 10 minutes to order then about 30-40 minutes to get the food, then we were done and sat there for another 20 or so until wait came. Ordered desert and it was ok at best. It was the chocolate pudding one. It had good flavor the texture was off.   Overall I would go back, but the amount of time it took was a bit crazy. Everyone in our party commented how they could make a lot more money if they learned how to turn tables quicker.",

And then they'll be in your dinner!  Our recent lunch was a delightful 2-hour experience with some of the best service we've received in a long time.  Greeted quickly, we nestled into a booth with a great view of the white-tiled kitchen.  First up: our order of meat/cheese starter.  We chose the Speck and Sopressata to sate our carnivorous side, and brie and gorgonzola as the requisite dairy fare.  The speck was out of this world, but I would have liked the brie to have been served room temperature. It was cold, thus, hard.  For entrees, between us we had the Farm Greens salad, and a Pepperoni pizza with wild mushrooms, fresh basil, garlic, and oregano. The salad was chilled and the pizza hot, so all was perfect in our world.  We thought the quality of the ingredients used was top-notch, and the freshness was worthy of commenting to our server about. The thin crust of the pizza made it a not-too-heavy addition to the lightness of the salad, and we left satisfied, but not stuffed.    All-in-all, the experience was great, the bill wasn't awful (around $35), and we were treated like the staff wanted us to enjoy ourselves.  And that's saying something.",

The Manzo/short rib pizza was alright, but the broccoli rabe adds such a bitter taste to the pizza that it masks any taste from the short ribs (which were also not as tender as I'd like). My friend ordered the Butcher sandwich, which she loved but it was really small. The fries were amazing, though!  I've also had one of the pasta specials, and another girlfriend really loved their butternut squash soup. Overall, really love this place!

The sauce was good, deffinetly pesto. The fresh spaghetti noodles were great. It comes with pine nuts, we got them on the side.

    "text": "I was thrilled when this place first opened because it's close to where I work and provided a decent lunch for under $20. The Parlor presents a strong offering with it's pizza crust and amiable service, however, it's actual pizza topping combinations and entrees are poorly balanced in terms of taste.  The only dish I like there is their build-your-own pizza, where I usually get the feta, goat cheese, bacon, artichoke hearts, arugula (light, otherwise they pile enough on to make it fit for a rabbit) and speck. The crust started out nice, but as time went on it got limp so I had to specify that they take time with it (surprising since that's their core value). Otherwise, it's sturdy, just crispy just soft enough, and holds the imperfections that characterize a good pizza crust well.  I tried their pre-selected topping pizzas twice, and both times felt they were bland and/or too savory. Their seafood pasta was nearly inedible, with some of the seafood being overcooked and rubbery. Desserts were quite inedible (chocolate cake (with fennel...) was dry and tasted like it was out of a box).  Service during lunch was good, though during dinner the same cannot be said. I was also severely disappointed when they were unwilling to make simple accomodations for repeat customers, which re-affirms my conclusion that this is a nice lunch place, but lacks the experience in food quality and service to make for a good dinner.  P.S. Ordered takeout for work once and had a co-worker get a sandwich; he was a little disgusted that the sandwich had large chunks of cauliflower on it. Did this chef go to culinary school? 2.5 stars.",

I had the Spinach salad with no bacon and vinaigrette on the side, always remember to ask for dressing on the side because anywhere I order a salad it's an over kill! I really did enjoy the Spinach Salad though, very fresh and it's my kind of food! I also had the Cauliflower Gratinata which was pretty good! A little too heavy for me but I do recommend it! Staff is friendly and food is delicious, what else can we ask for! (Only the bathrooms kind of scare me because I expect someone to be sitting in the salon chair when I walk out of the stall....)",

The ambiance is semi-upscale, but made funky with salon-style chairs at the bar and a comfortable outside patio.  Our bartender, Chris, was friendly and particularly good about refilling water glasses (I know, I notice the smallest things, but that's because so many people would ignore this detail!).  They also serve pizza, and although it's really good, the excessive grease is the only reason I'm not giving it a 5-star review.  Either way, it's a fun venue in a great part of town!",

Ladies, if you are in need of that pasta fix that plagues us often, this is your dish.  Heaven in a bowl.   Make your own Pizza-who could ask for more?  And instead of making it insanely expensive to create exactly what you want, they start the base price at a reasonable place Pepperoni & Ricotta-speaking of make your own pizza, try this combo.  You will not be disappointed.   Seasonal specials-there are always daily specials.  This winter there was a duck pasta dish that made me weak in the knees.   Two sizes of pasta!-Want to split a pizza with someone and have just a taste of pasta.  Then get the smaller portion.  Just want a big bowl o' pasta, order the large.  This is brilliance in my opinion.   Service-Has always been friendly and attentive.   Atmosphere-love.  There's not a bad seat in the house.   My one and only small complaint: they only take reservations for parties of 12 or more!  That's right, 12!  A lot of times six or eight of us want to go but to wait for tables together is just silliness.",

    "text": "I'm in Phoenix for three weeks, hanging with friends.  One friend, a resident, was flying back in from a business trip, so I picked up her roommate M and we picked up A, and fell back to the age-old question: 'Where are we eating?'  After some back and forthing, we decided on The Parlor.  I'd been here before with my wife, A had been here before with her mom.  My wife loved it, but she's at home.  A's mom didn't like it, which greatly pleased A.  And M's boyfriend wasn't there, so we all got to indulge in stuff that our other halves, in whatever form they took, didn't like.  We started with the Frito Misto, a very nice fried calamari with rock shrimp and a Romesco sauce.  Wonderful dish.  Very lightly battered and fried, the breading was nicely seasoned and flavorful.  I can't say I was thrilled with the sauce.  Then came the pizzas and whatever pasta dish that A had.  We got to poke fun at her when she confused pecorino with pepperocinis, she didn't realize she'd confused peppers for cheese.  To be fair, she'd had a long trip and was very tired.  M had the Yukon potato/leek pizza, substituting the gorgonzola.  Me, I fell back on my fav: pepperoni and added extra-crispy bacon.  We were all happy with our food.  The Yukon had a wonderful creamy consistency to it that melded flavors quite nicely.  I knew Parlor's pepperoni was on the greasy side, but that's pretty much normal for pepperoni pizzas, so I won't ding them on that.  I quite liked my pizza, they got the bacon nice and crispy, though I would have liked more of it.    For dessert we split the chocolate cake and the Mixed Berry Zeppole, quite yummy.  No complaints about the food, they do a great job of turning out quality dishes.  One complaint about the noise.  You are not going to have a quiet conversation with your table mates if you go at night, maybe lunch is quieter, I dunno.  This place hops, I don't know if it ever really slows down.  It's an unfortunate trend in restaurant design to go for a cool look with lots of hard, sound-reflective, surfaces, and that can be a problem.  The first time that I ate there was probably a year ago, and one big change has happened: they now have valet parking.  Again, dunno if they're there for lunch, maybe it's a dinner-only thing.  The parking is still free, but it's going to take a little time to park and get your car.  I really appreciated that the valets were in tune with how long the wait was, they told us that for three that it would probably be less than ten minutes if they couldn't take us directly, and they took us pretty much straight away.  Excellent dining experience, highly recommended.  Just be ready for the noise.",

When we have gone with other people who have tried other things off the menu the reviews haven't all been great, thus the 4 stars instead of 5. The only other thing we have tried is the cauliflower appetizer. Doesn't sound too appealing, right? Cauliflower. Trust me, order it!

    "text": "Finally made it to The Parlor for dinner.  I was waiting until it had been open for awhile and the hype had died down.  Apparently it has not as it was packed on a Wednesday evening.  Thanks to Christina P for pointing out the herb garden in front.  Very nice to know my meal was not made with dried herbs from a 5-gallon jar from Sam's Club, although I could certainly tell it was not.  I really like the interior with the exception that the acoustics are terrible, and it is really loud.  But since it's not a fine dining experience, I was not bothered by it.  We started with the meat and cheese selection, served with grilled rosemary flatbread.  You choose your own meat and cheeses from a list at $3 each.  I love that you can customize your appetizer and order as much or as little as you want.    Although they had some really appealing salads and pastas, I decided I should order a pizza.  I went with the Smokey (smoked prosciutto, olive tapenade, and ricotta, topped with arugula).  At $10 for an 8\" pizza, it was not only delicious, but affordable as well.  The combination of flavors was perfect.  I really liked the pizza crust, but it was a little soft towards the center.    We ordered two desserts.  One was the special, which was a dried fruit bread pudding.  I'm normally not big on bread pudding, but I have to say this was really good.  The other was the zeppole, ricotta fritters.  I was actually expecting a ricotta filling.  Instead, they were essentially small doughnuts made with ricotta.  Still delicious and moist, served with cranberry and chocolate dipping sauces.  Service was decent, not perfect.  I certainly enjoyed The Parlor enough to make the long 9-mile drive from home for this one!",

    "text": "They do everything right. Excellent caesar salad. Ordered the standard pepperoni, mushroom and garlic pizza to judge. Mushrooms are fresh and roasted. No complaints, however, the crust is not my favorite. It is thin crust, which I prefer. I didn't detect any real flavor and the outer ring of the crust is pillowing and soft, very light and airy. If that is your thing, you will love it. I prefer it to have some \"bite\" or \"tug\" to  it, more crispy and crunchy. For me, there were way too many mushrooms on the pie. They totally dominated the flavor and it was all I could taste. Small parking lot that fills quickly, then you have to use valet.",

We were taken very good care of.  The design of The Parlor was very attractive. The low lighting and booths seemed like it would be a great place for a more intimate night.   I can't remember all the pies we had, but the most memorable was the Yukon Gold Potato with and egg on top. It was surprisingly good.   I've had better pies, but this place is excellent in my opinion. 5 stars for superb food and service.",

Obviously to keep from being soggy upon pick up but the dressing they supply is more than what they would toss with if you ate on site. Unfortunately I trusted the portions they gave me would recreate the \"on site\" salad and I ended up drowning my poor salad into a soggy mess. Also I had to tell the boy packing the order not to put the burgers in with the salads. Hello? Isn't that \"Working in a restaurant 101\"  n'est ce pas?",

While the dough may not be quite as amazing as at Pizzeria Bianco's it is a close second, and the fact that you do not have to wait 3-4 hours for a table more than makes up for this.  Whenever we go we make a point to order the Funghi pizza, which never fails to be a favorite among all the people we introduce to the place either. I have also had several of their soups du jour and have never been disappointed.

By far some of the best gourmet pizza I have ever had! I had a side salad along with the pepperoni pizza. Also tried the BBQ chicken pizza and banana creme pie for dessert. The crust is fantastic and the sauce is so yummy! I'm not a huge fan of BBQ chicken pizza but it was really good. The BBQ sauce wasn't overpowering the rest of the flavor of the pizza and they put serrano peppers on it as well! I loved the spice! The salad was even delicious. They take the time to cut the center of the cucumber out and I love that little detail. Now... Moving on the dessert... That banana creme was so amazing and the graham crust at the bottom is to die for! I think I died and went to heaven! It was so good! I can't wait to go back and try some other menu items. Oh and the service was amazing too. Our server suggested some really great items from the menu to try and it all was fantastic! The building is so unassuming from the outside but once inside it is spectacular!",

Once I realized I was VERY underdressed (basketball shorts and sneakers) I decided to just order take out. I was tired from driving from LA anyways wanted to eat comfortably I'm the hotel.   Anyways, ordered the Uh... Siccilla pizza (please forgive my spelling its the sausage pizza) the spicy seafood linguini and the Caesar salad. The food was amazing. The flavors were perfect. The pizza was perfectly crunchy where it was supposed to be and soft where it was needed. The crust didn't over power the toppings, I've honestly never had a pizza so perfectly created. All the toppings and flavors came together so perfectly, it was AMAZING. Then, the spicy seafood linguini , very generous with the seafood ! It had clams, squid, shrimp , scallops. It looked and tasted amazing, again the flavors were all present but one did not overwhelm the other. It had the perfect balance of sauce and pasta. I could not get how amazing the sauce was . Additionally it had tiny strips of (I think) cucumber ? It added a great freshness to the dish.  The salad stood out because of the sourdough croutons. Oh man, I hate sourdough bread, but these croutons were amazing. They complimented the dressing and lettuce with the best flavors.  Overall I loved the food, the service I received even as a \"to-go\" customer was outstanding. I would definatly  come back for dinner, but I'd bring some pants and a nice shirt.",

    "text": "Let me preface by saying that I'm not a desk jockey that writes reviews on restaurants based on portion size, wait time and how important they made me feel. It's about the food! My credentials are: 10 years back of the house fine dining experience and 6 years dining professionally as a fine wine distributor. I've never had a bad meal at The Parlor and generally find myself talking for days about whatever the latest seasonal menu item I've tried is. That said, any restaurant  is destined to have an inconsistency now and then...  It's just never happened to me here.  Let me get to the point. I'm a very adventurous eater but now and then when I find a classic dish that is executed in superb fashion, I'll fall back to it time and time again. THE PARLOR MAKES THE BEST CAESAR SALAD IN THE VALLEY. It's such a simple preparation yet somehow 95% of valley restaurants do something to screw it up. They either deconstruct it and make it a chore to eat or put there own twist on it that completely takes it out of the realm of what a caesar salad is. How arrogant.  Too all other PHX restaurants: Just because you use romaine doesn't make it a Caesar.   Lesson:  Caesar Salad = Chopped or torn Romaine hearts, Creamy parmesan and anchovy emulsion, fresh toasted (and seasoned) croutons and some shaved Parmigiano Reggiano.  THANK YOU PARLOR PIZZERIA FOR KEEPING IT REAL!",

We were a large party of 6 there to celebrate a birthday and when we got there and put our name in (around 5:30 PM) we were told between 45-60 minutes by the hostess.    We got some wine and hung out outside of the restaurant.  When 45 minutes had gone by I went to check on the seating - just to see how long it would be.  My exact question was - I just want to check and see how we are doing on our table?  The hostess (whom I later found out to be named Shauna) said to me, verbatim, \"Um I told you guys it would be a hour when you got here and we are waiting for your table to get up from the patio.\"  Her attitude was appalling and  I was SHOCKED that was how she spoke to me.  I walked back outside and joined my party.  About 30 more minutes had gone by and my mom stopped in and inquired about the reservation (at this point the outside area had been cleared of all other large parties and we were well past our \"given time\".  The same hostess looked at my mom and said \"You guys have already been up here tonight and I told you that we are waiting for a table on the patio to leave.\"  I have worked in restaurants and run the front of the house for extremely busy places so I understand when it's busy, but there was absolutely no excuse for how she spoke to both my mom and I.  Eventually a different hostess came outside and sat us and the rest of the service was great (along with the food), but I think it's important to note that the front of the house makes the first impression and she really made a poor one to our party.",

    "text": "I have been to the Parlor twice now for dinner - the first time was on a Thursday night with a group of eight and the second time was with a friend this past Saturday night. This past Saturday night, the restaurant and bar area were packed - luckily my friend and I were able to grab two seats at the bar which is where we dined rather than face a 40 minute wait for a table either inside or outside. The feel of The Parlor is modern but inviting. I love the exposed brick in the bar area.  The pesto pizza (minus the tomatoes) is delicious - it's big enough to share if you want, but not so big that if you ate it yourself you would feel like a pig. The caesar salad is a nice size and would suffice as a meal if you wanted to. The pesto chiatarra pasta is really good. It's the perfect portion size (it also comes with a piece of toasted bread that is great to soak up pesto after you are done with the pasta) and is really flavorful. The tiramisu is the best I have ever tried - it was so light tasting and I would have ate the whole thing if my friend had let me! A single scoop of gelato (I tried the chocolate) is a perfect light dessert.  Not only is the food delicious, but it's perfectly portioned and very reasonably priced. You won't break the bank dining here. On my first trip, my bill came to $20 (after tax and tip) for a salad, beer, and half a 12\" pizza. On Saturday night, our bill came to $33 before tip (2 entrees and 2 desserts). Our drinks were paid for by a nice gentleman in the bar area who felt bad about intruding our space when going up to order drinks. If we had paid for our beers, they would have ranged in price from $3.50 to $5. The draft selection is much better than most restaurants and even some bars!  I definitely recommend this place and hope to be back in the near future.",

Now the seafood linguine features overcooked, rubbery seafood, and whole prawns which, since they are not peeled, force diners to immerse their hands in tomato sauce to extract prawns from their shells. The pizza, which used to be their signature dish, is now a distant shadow of what it used to be - soggy, unappetizing and bland. The service is now proffered by inhospitable servers who need to be told to provide plates and cutlery.",

The Chef's (Logan) attention to detail, attentiveness, and hospitality was as good as it gets. The company I was with - as good as it gets. The food - was pretty damn delicious!  1. We had a tasting of many dishes that started off with an amuse of a smoky cured piggy cut  wrapped fig.   2. Breaded risotto spheres with fontina, a hint of saffron that pleasantly lingered and melded into the deeply flavored tomato sauce.   3. Beet salad that was as texturally entertaining as the flavors. What I liked most about this was the hidden pockets of fatty avocado that when you found one sparked a whole different experience in your mouth.  I would have liked to see the nut crusted goat cheese round cared for as much as the other components. It was left to the side and begged for attention.   4. A pasta, not sure what they called it, but it looked like spatzle and had a light mouthfeel similar to a proper gnocchi. This dish was completely entertaining.  There was a lot of thought that went into this dish. I'm not sure what the menu name is but look for the pasta dish with fennel, bitter greens, acid, savory artichokes, briny olives - it was 5 taste delicious.    5. Finally we had the Marg pizza and the shroom pizza. Both was delicious. The marg had beautiful red and yellow tomatoes and fresh basil. The Shroom was RICH and went perfectly with the bright marg pizza.  The crust for me was a little too chewy and heavy but it's perfect for people who like a crust that is in between thin and thick.   The profiles of every dish was carefully thought for. The chefs put together dishes using techniques that allowed each ingredient to shine on it's own and at the same work harmoniously with others to make up really good dishes. This was a great experience for me.",

    "text": "The Parlor is great.  They have a menu, with stuff on it, but my favorite is the sushi-style paper menu for ordering pizza.  I've never tried anything else, but my wife likes their salads.  Start with a 8-inch cheese for $6, then a buck for vegatables/add'l cheeses and 2 bucks for meat.  Add an ice-cold Bass (beer, not fish) and I am in heaven.  All the vegatables are from local farms, and the herbs are grown right outside the front door.  The urban redo of an old beauty parlor is great - exactly the type of development Phoenix should be encouraging.  Character is good.   Parking sucks.  In particular, if you are the jerk in the bronze mercedes who parked 6 inches from the driver side of my car despite the fact that I parked WAAAAAY over on the side of my spot on the end of the row, I regret to inform you that you have a large white door ding. You brought it upon yourself.",

    "text": "On at least four or five occasions we've tried to go to The Parlor, a former beauty salon turned upscale pizza restaurant, but there has always been a long wait to get seated. Given that, and it's consistently good reviews, we made a plan to eat a late breakfast so we could hold off having lunch until 3PM, figuring this was way past lunchtime but too early for happy hour. We were right, there were only a few cars in the lot - we were really excited and had high expectations of a delicious meal. Whoever was responsible for the renovation did a fabulous job. There's lots of exposed brick, wood, glass bricks, and a cute little patio. At the bar there are some salon-type chairs: I don't know how comfortable they'd be for cocktail sipping, but they're a witty touch. My favorite part of the decor is the planters lined up along the path to the door. They're filled with fresh herbs and tomato plants. We were even more convinced that we'd have a great meal. And our server didn't let us down either (service has been the major negative in most of the reviews). He was pleasant and helpful.       We started off with a roasted beet and avocado salad ($9.75). The colors of the golden beets and mellow green of the avocados made for a beautiful plate, and the walnut crusted goat cheese was the perfect foil. While a little on the expensive side, we felt it was worth it. We couldn't wait to dig into the pizza!!       According to the menu, the Smokey pizza ($14 for a 12\") is topped with speck (smoked prosciutto), olive tapenade, ricotta, and fresh arugula. Sounds good, doesn't it? It arrived at the table heaped with arugula, with a few pieces of speck on top. I think they put so much arugula on the pie so you couldn't see the paucity of the other ingredients. The only taste that stood out, overpowering even the arugula, was the tomato sauce. OMG, it transported me instantly to my high school cafeteria - and that's not a good place for me to be !!!  Do you remember those thick slices of bready dough topped with a thin, tinny tasting sauce? Aaggh, get me out of there !!! At least at The Parlor the crust was thin, but it was limp as a noodle, and tasteless. I actually, for the first time in living memory, didn't take home the leftovers. That's how bad it was.       I wouldn't tell you not to go here. The Parlor is a pretty place, and the salad was outstanding, but I wish you good luck with the pizza.",

    "text": "Tried the Parlor for the first time on a recent weekend to celebrate a special occasion.  Arriving just before seven p.m. on a Saturday night, I was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait and we were seating as soon as we got there.  Service was very friendly, efficient and quick.  I ordered a beer and the wife ordered a glass of wine and we decided to split the house greens and the pizza that comes with pesto/pine nuts/tomato.  The house greens were very good, plenty of pecans and chunks of gorgonzola.  The pie was also good, though it did seem a bit greasy.  Crust was nice and chewy, especially around the edges and had a good flavor.  Was also good the next day for lunch after a quick ride in the toaster oven.  For dessert we split an order of zeppoles, or if you prefer, fresh out-of-the-fryer donut holes.  I liked these and especially with the salted butter caramel sauce.  Much better than the beignets at Bourbon Steak.  One weird thing about these though...when we ordered them the server says, 'you haven't ordered these before have you?' and proceeds to tell us that they are still good, they just changed the recipe a little bit and something about orange rind/zest in the filling now.  This was weird because we specifically discussed that this was our first time in the restaurant!  Of course, I don't expect him to remember the details of every conversation he has with every table but still...  Also, out of six zeppoles/donut holes, only one bite with any strong orange flavor was noted.  Anywho, had a very good experience there, and wouldn't hesitate to return.",

    "text": "My date suggested we go here. I had never heard about it and tend to think of myself as someone who thanks to Yelp and my desire to try out new places is a bit in the know but no ones perfect. This place though is as good as it gets for me in Phoenix. Walking toward the entrance, despite the nondescript facade and location I knew I was going to love it. Really liked the design job they have done and the interior is just perfect. I have yet to go to the Vig but can imagine it's the same vibe. It's one of the rare places I've eaten in Phoenix that not only scores on the decor and food but where I could sense there was a certain atmosphere (maybe from all the people loving this place as much as I did). The place was busy, and we went at 7:30 and were seated at the bar near the entrance. We ate at the pizza bar and though I could say that if there is a negative it's the seating that's composed of bar stools but found that you were a bit low in the stool for ideal eating. Not a big issue though. What impressed me was the food though. You can choose from a few selected pizzas or make your own with some great ingredients. They offer an 8 and 12 inch option and they very reasonably priced for the quality. We had the pesto pizza and I composed my own, putting in some mushrooms,mozzarella,fresh tomatoes,spinach and ricotta. Definitely was proud of myself because it was delicious and though maybe a small pizza for some choosing two 8inchers filled us both up. Decided to have a dessert even though nothing was nothing out of the ordinary, the Cappuccino Panna Cotta. Small portion but very very tasty. All in all already one of my favorite places in Phoenix.   Only negative is that their website doesn't offer a view of their menu but this place made me feel like I wasn't actually in some standard restaurant in Phoenix and is a great addition to the Phoenix scene.",

I didn't trust that it would be as good the second time. I was wrong! I went with my Brother (the Sommelier) and his wife, who drove in from San Diego for the weekend.  And Jason B. who clearly loves this place. We decided to start with a pizza as an appetizer. The Duck pizza, it was very delectable. The Squash puree was really well flavored and went  will with the pizza, which surprised me.  I ordered the Duck Club, oh my! It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The Duck was so tender and the red wine jelly was so well flavored it really made the sandwich! I would recommend everyone try the Duck Club! My brother and his wife shared the beet salad, which was good but too small according to my brother. The Spicy Seafood Linguine, which he said was exactly what he had hoped it would be and really excellent. And the Spicy Barbeque Chicken Pizza (They were really hungry!) and they enjoyed the pizza as well.  I find my family hard to impress, and they were, so for that alone the place deserves 5 Stars!  Service was good, the pizza was slow, but then they can only fit so many in the oven, so we understand. The wine selection was okay, not impressive according to my brother, but they thought the prices were good. Over all a great experience and the perfect place to impress out of town family! Great job The Parlor!",

    "text": "Being a gourmet pizza fan, I had been wanting to try this place for awhile, but I was afraid that all the hype was unwarranted.  I was not disappointed.    We arrived at 6pm on a Friday night and the wait was 15 minutes as promised by the hostesses.  The restaurant was busy with several parties waiting and a trendy, happenin' vibe. The clients span from young families to seniors.  We ordered the frito misto and 8 inch Margherita pizza to share as appetizers. The frito misto was a mix of calamari and shrimp, with very thin breading and a roasted red pepper sauce. The sauce was tasty, but the portion was very small for $9. The pizza was better than expected - the crust was not as chewy as Cibo or Pizza a Metro, but softer and more airy, but stil thin. It was cooked perfectly and had a pleasing flavor.  We each ordered a pasta dish, me the pesto spaghetti (large - $18) and my companion the duck chiatarra (one size - $12).  I was pleasantly surprised that the pasta is fresh.  The menu says the pesto is seasonal, and that night it was basil pesto.  The pasta was a nice texture and the sauce was tasty.  At $18 for a large, the price was a bit high, but at least you have the option of ordering a large and not feeling unsatisfied with a small portion (as can happen at PastaBar).  The duck chiatarra with vegetable ragout had a very flavorful red wine and earthy flavor, with baby carrots and mushrooms. The chiatarra pasta was a little on the mushy side, but not terrible.  There was plenty of duck in the dish which made it a good deal at $12.  On the whole, the pasta itself is not as good as PastaBar, but the sauces are on par and the value is a bit better.   As a huge fan of fresh pasta, I plan on returning to try the other pastas, as well as some of the other pizzas.",

We were there for Happy Hour (after being turned away from Upper Crust Pizza on 24th street for having our 19 year old son with us)  We were lucky enough to have Eddy as our server and he was attentive, polite and funny! We sat on the patio, which I believe to be one of the loveliest in the valley and thoroughly enjoyed every moment of our meal. We had the Frito Misto and Cauliflower Gratinata for appetizers and we each ordered our own small pizzas. I had the Calabrian pizza which was amazing, just the right amount of spice, my friend had the Fungi which I believe to be the best mushroom pizza in town, she loved it! We also had the Summer corn pizza and the Salciccia, two of the best pizzas on the menu. We all agreed that this was some of the very best pizza in town.The Parlor certainly knows how to do it right, we will be telling all our friends to go there and will definitely be back!",

Boards come with pita bread, pesto, and my favorite the peperonata sauce.  I also get the spinach salad- with avocado, egg, bacon, cherry tomato, and a tangy dressing.  I have occasionally added chicken to the salad, but I prefer not to- chicken is not their strong suit.  They have a decent selection of wines and I opt to get a white by the glass.  The atmosphere is fun, with remnants of the building's former life as a beauty parlor.  Great patio and bar as well.  Limited parking-valet available during busy times.",

The pizzas listed are a better value than the create your own pizzas in my opinion, but they're all delicious!  One surprising thing about the pizzas here is how loaded they are with toppings.  They're all fresh, and definitely not skimping on anything.  Great pizza, and the fritto misto is a great appetizer too.  Parking is sometimes hard on a busier weekend night though.",

The last pizza I had was the Yukon Gold, which basically tastes like potatoes au gratin baked on top of a pizza. Absolutely delicious. I swapped slices with some of my friends and they quickly said they wished they'd ordered same as I did. Mind you their pizzas were also delicious, but the Yukon Gold was just a level higher.   Prices are very reasonable. An 8\" pizza is roughly $10, but these pizzas are handmade and every 8\" pizza I've had there was closer to 10\"-11\". I think of it this way: you're getting basically the standard of quality you'd get at Bianco but without the wait or slightly higher price. The Parlor is an excellent alternative, and I have to say that it's my preferred pizza spot in town.",

We showed up at 7:30 on a Saturday night.  The place was packed but the wait was just a few minutes.  I love the set up.  The parlor has a very modern ambiance with a fun and hip vibe.  I love the drink menu.  Great Beer selection.  I love pizza and pasta with fresh ingredients.  That's this place's specialty.  But despite the uniqueness of many of the selections on the menu, I just wasn't all that impressed with what was on the plates.   My group of four ordered the Tonnarelli \"Cacio e Pepe.\"  This was really good, the pasta and sauce taste home-made, but it was a little too creamy for me.  We also had the Zucca Pizza.  A decent pizza with summer squash, leeks, squash blossoms pecorino and basil.  This was pretty good, and flavorful, but not a cohesive pizza.  It just felt like the toppings were tossed on top of a white pizza.  We also had the Roasted Corn Pizza.  This was great.  Corn, chillies, and cilantro.  Perfect.",

    "text": "While on our quest for the city's best traditional margherita pizza we stopped here to try it out what they had to offer.  The first thing I like about this place is the fresh herb garden outside when you walk up. The smell of fresh basil is intoxicating as you put your name in for a table. This got us very excited!  We had very quick service! I ordered the arancine as our appetizer the saffron risotto was heavenly. So we were excited to get our margherita pizza...   When it came we were disappointed...now I know that ever restaurant has their own take on margherita pizza, but if you are going to claim you have the some of the best pizza in town then I think your margherita pizza should be pretty dang close to the traditional Italian neapolitan pizza style margherita pizza. BUT it wasn't, it was actually quite gross.   The crust was WAY to floury and there was no sauce, NONE just ice cold tomato slices stuck on the pizza with the cheese not even melted all the way. The basil just thrown on there.   We had to choke it down and the server even asked us why we didn't finish it as if he was surprised we didn't like it. We tried to explain to him the type of margherita pizza we like and how it should be done and he looked at us like we were crazy. Obviously, he isn't much of a foodie. But we didn't want to be rude and we didn't send it back, we just quietly ate and quickly asked for our bill.   It surprises me that other reviews claim the margherita is good here. They obviously like a salad thrown on a warm pizza crust or have never had True neapolitan style margherita pizza....   However, a couple weeks later we discovered Pomo in Scottsdale and that my friends is the best margherita pizza in the Phoenix area. They do neapolitan the right way...  I doubt we ever go back to The Parlor. We are not fans of meaty type pizzas, if we were I am sure we would like this place as that is the type of pizzas every table around us ordered. So maybe that is how they got a good name is for those type of pizzas.",

Prepare to leave stuffed but it will be one of the best meals you've had in a long time!    Start with the cauliflower or brussles sprouts, maybe share a parlor insalata.  They change out specials seasonally that are always delicious and innovative, but the staples are my favorite.  If you are feeling pizza, go for the calabrian, a spicier more sophisticated cousin of the classic pepperoni.    My all time favorite is the pappardelle bolognese, I have yet to have a bolognese that even comes close, and the wide delicious pappardelle pasta is made in house, truly a MUST!    Can't choose, get a few things in the smaller sizes and try to save room for dessert!",

Once we walked in though realized this was going to be one of my regular restaurants.  Had a meat and cheese selection for an appetizer, great flavor.  I had a pasta dish with big chunks of bacon crunchies and red sauce, tres yum.  It was very busy but the noise level was great.  They also let you design your own pizza.  Great place and close to me=my new fave.",

The BBQ chicken pizza is unlike any other BBQ chicken! We closed our eyes and enjoyed! The atmosphere of the parlor is great for a weeknight, with dim lighting and candle lit tables--definitely great for a date night or just to grab some amazing food and enjoy fabulous service! Thank you! We love the parlor! It's our second time here now and they've treated us well!",

We got the House salad for a starter.  The small size was plenty large for both of us to share.  Nothing too remarkable about the salad, but I did enjoy it.  Since our pizzas took so long to get out to us, they gave us free dessert, which was really considerate -- we didn't even have to mention that the food took a long time or anything, they just noticed and took the initiative themselves.  We ordered the maple trifle which was really interesting.... it came with chunks of date cake, whipped cream, nuts.  Not my favorite dessert but they get points for trying something different!",

Well it sure as hell is to everyone at our table who can't hear a damn thing in this place.  Concrete walls, wood everywhere, and loud music that people are determined to talk over - all combined they make this like going to a live concert.  Maybe the 20-something kids don't mind this but I think the adult customers will probably find it annoying as I did.  On the whole, this place is better than the nearby competition (Oreganos).  Better decor, better beer choices, better quality food, and slightly better parking (only slightly, it still sucks at Parlor).  The cauiflower with aged cheddar cheese was quite tasty, but only came with 1 small piece of bread.  Pizzas were above average but not great - our crusts were burnt, and it felt like Sunday morning when I get to be the one who eats up the burnt pieces of toast.  Cheeses & herbs/seasonings were good, but with the build your own I wish I had known I was going to pay individually for mozzerella cheese.  Would it have had no cheese if I had not checked that box?  Isn't cheese included in the base price of a pizza?  They have a far better than average draft beer list, including 2 offerings from Four Peaks, a few imports, and the obligatory macro-swill that so many Americans prefer.  Great that they had HopKnot.  Prices were reasonable and service was average.  The female server \"uniform\" of a skin tight white shirt should not be worn by everyone.  It looked great on the thin girls, but for the others it just highlighted the spare tire that shouldn't be there when you're that young.  Drivers of nice cars are forewarned - the spillover parking is pretty much gravel, with some of the spots quite narrow, and don't be surprised to see some inconsiderate customers parking illegally and almost blocking you into your spot.  They don't take Discover Card.",

For some reason, it was incredibly slow, even though the place was not that busy.

We went here about a year ago when it first opened and it was jammed packed with beautiful people. This time we went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and it was still delicious but with a much more mellow vibe.   Definitely try the garden mojito. It is really refreshing and the cucumber and fresh mint are what makes the drink. Brandon, my fiance, loves that they have cold PBR for $2.50 on tap.   All of the salads sound terrific but we decided on the parlor insalata for me and the farm greens for Brandon. Both salads were made with very fresh ingredients and a big portion for a small sized salad. The salads are even perfect by themselves for a lunch entree.  We were going to try and design our own pizza but decided we should leave this job to the professionals and went with the smokey pizza (ricotta cheese, prosciutto and arugula). It was amazing! The crust is perfect- light, crispy and tasty.   I love the Parlor , I only wish it was open on Sundays and that the parking situation wasn't so crappy. Lucky for me this place is within walking distance so we will be back for sure!",

Everyone has covered just about every aspect of this place.  Walking up, you see the garden where they grow herbs, eggplant, tomatoes, peppers, and a few other goodies that they use for specials.  Inside, the place has been renovated wonderfully and it is beautiful.  The old 60's-style wall is really made into the centerpiece of the restaurant and I love everything about it.  I tried the Watermelon Agua (vodka + watermelon juice) and it was amazing.  Be had the eggplant bruschetta and it was a wonderful combination of sweet and tart.  Brilliant!  We also ordered a pepperoni pizza and a potato pizza.  The pepperoni was by far the best because the meat was perfectly spicy and, I imagine, from Schreiners.  Finally, we had some lemon pudding with raspberries with a ginger cookie.  Strange combination but excellent.  The food was outstanding and our server was one of the best I've ever had.  Can't say enough about how great this place is.  Glad to have it and ESPECIALLY glad to have it by the Colonnade (which is a culinary vacuum.",

Right off the bat, I love the inconspicuous nature of The Parlor, you could drive by 3 times and still never really see the presence of a hustlin' bustlin' hip pizzeria.   Parking at new & hip restaurants is normally a bear to say the least, but some wonderful and efficient thought was put into the design, making the experience of tackling parking, a whole lot less stressful.  As you walk in (dont miss the fresh herb garden on your righthand side), you cant help but feel the modernist and contemporary stylings.....its the VIG and LGO Pizzeria blended into a wonderful concoction.  During the first visit, we sat on the patio around 530pm. Yeah, it was 105 frickin degrees outside, but with the mist system they have cooling the air and fresh plantings it was quite comfortable. We enjoyed appetizers and a meat/cheese plate to start, and then a pizza with oliver tempanade, Schrieners sausage, and gorgonzola cheese. All of the food was light, fresh, and filling.  A satisfying first trip.  Round two was on a busy Friday night, around 745pm. Expecting to wait an hour, we were pleasantly surprised that it was just a 20 minute wait for a party of two. In the meantime we enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar and spent half our time watching Sportscenter and half our time people watching... after being seated in the main dining room, instead of trying another meat/cheese combination or appetizer, we dove head first into 2 pizzas and a bottle of vino. We tried the traditional pepperoni and then the yukon gold potato pie. Again the food was fresh, well cooked, and served in a timely manner.  The Parlor should be your new pizza epicenter if you like friendly service, fresh tasting food, and a centrally convenient location.",

The hot wood-fired oven makes the crust perfect, and the taste of the bread is wonderful.  Same goes for their twist on the BBQ Chicken pizza salad.  Instead of raw red onions, you get grilled shallots.  Some heat is added with serrano chiles to give it wonderful heat in the back of your mouth.  The cheese they use is also great, and it is among the best pizza's in town (which is saying something with places like Bianco and Patsy Grimaldi's in the valley).  For sandwiches/burgers, I had the brie and mushroom burger, which is divine.  The fries are also top-notch (ask for the garlic aioli on the side).  The Duck Club is another instant favorite of mine, with applewood bacon, garlic aioli, and red-wine jam.  The flavors just explode on your first bite.  Finally, the soup I had was great.  It was a split-pea and braised pork soup topped with a dollop of creme fraiche.  The velvety flavors of this soup must come from the fat in the pork.  Don't worry about calories and just order it if it is on the menu.  The decor is great as well, and when it cools down in the valley, it will be a great place for outdoor seating.  Service isn't the best, but I am sure they will improve as time goes on.  Not only do I love this restaurant, but everyone I have taken there has also fallen in love with it.  I am sure it will be a Phoenix institution for years to come if they keep their innovation and quality up to par.",

So I thought this would be the younger modern fusion of pizza. I loved the location and decor of this restaurant it was very inviting and I loved the fact that they carried LUX coffee since that is some good coffee. The pizza is another story I really didn't feel they matched flavors well duck with citrus and and too many herb mixings on all the pizzas we got. we also found hair in one of the pizza's which I got really grossed out after that and I didn't want to continue eating anymore. Overall great decor/ambiance, music and coffee is great but I will not be back after the whole pizza incident.",

    "text": "Went to the parlor last night with my boyfriend. We showed up at 6pm and there was a 20 minute wait. I guess you can't make reservations unless your party consists of 10+ people.   Now why does everyone else give this place 5 stars and I give it 4? The food is definitely 5 star food. It's DELICIOUS. My boyfriend got the pizza which was fresh out of the brick oven, bubbly, and full of cheese. The star of the show was my sandwich! I got the \"grinder\" which had 'seasonal vegetables' provolone cheese, and salami on it. It came with a ton of parmesan and herb dusted fries. The sandwich was on a soft roll, dripping in a vinaigrette that the vegetables had been soaked in until tender. You would think that putting carrots, celary, bell peppers, and cauliflower on a sandwich would be disgusting, but it was ah-maz-ing. I couldn't stop eating it. My stomach was about to explode when finally I asked for a box. Made great leftovers.  I knock 1/2 star off for their non existent appetizers. When I eat pizza, I want some garlic bread. There were no appetizers on the menu. They gave you a paper for cheese & meat which came with rosemary bread, but that's just not my style.  Another 1/2 star was knocked off for the restaurant being short staffed. I felt so bad for our waiter. She was running back and forth, looked stressed, and was waiting way too many tables for her own good.   But the food is de-lic-ious. I'll be back.",

The pizzas were slightly burned at the edges, but the burn actually enhanced the flavor of the mixture of vegetables on the pizza.  We had the donut hold type dessert.  Amazing.  Delicious.

The service was good, considering how crowded they were, but I would have to come back during the week at lunch or dinner to really see if the employees have the kind of attention to detail to make you come back.  I would definitely go back with my wife, but would not bring my whole family when it is that crowded. Kids would ruin the experience when the wait is that long.  Drinks were also tasty, check out the bar menu...if that suits you. Enjoy! PS My favorite place is Cafepino, because the food is also excellent, but I get consistently great service, and don't have the extended wait. My wife needed a change from Cafepino (that is my \"go to\"\" place; so I made this a nice date nite, and she had a great time. If you want to catch the movie though, than Cafepino is a better choice...",

We had spinach salad lightly dressed with EVOO, next time I would ask for a sprinkle of balsamic to add at the table but that's just me.  Shared a Margherita Pizza, liked the crust a lot, nice chewy rind.  They have a small garden area outside, not sure if its for looks or if I just ate some of it - either way its a nice touch!  Friendly service, no rushing us from the table, will definitely return and bring friends.  IN fact, already booked two lunch dates in JANUARY!  Happy New Year to me, found a new LOCALLY owned restaurant!",

    "text": "One of the few restaurants I rarely tire of. The only pizza place where the dough and cheese that constitutes one of their delicious pizzas never leaves me feeling tired, groggy, and gross afterward. How do they do that? I love pizza, but most of the time, eating it (eating too much of it...) is physically taxing and leaves me wanting to nap and flog myself for getting into a situation where i'm going to feel full and uncomfortable for hours on end after the meal. But this pizza, though more than satiating, is cloudlike, easier to digest, and airly floats rather than settles rock-like in the stomach. How often is pizza compared to a satiating cloud? Not often!!  I love the atmosphere of this restaurant too, though if the food were mediocre or bad, the stars above would reflect that. The atmosphere only adds a sixth star if that was an option. The Parlor used to be a beauty parlor, which everyone knows by now, but no one knows that my grandma used to get her hair done there.  I love their appetizers. The bay shrimp in the frito misto melt in the mouth, and even the calamari is not rubbery.  The salads are not just afterthoughts here. The parlor insalata is almost as good as the pizza, which crispy chickpeas, fresh greens, kalamata olives, flavorful tomatoes (not bland red chunks of what looks like tomato), feta, lovely vinaigrette dressing, and probably a few other ingredients i am forgetting.   I could go on and on. But I won't....Just wanted to add to the other compliments toward this locally owned restaurant.",

I don't think they're wood fired (just brick-oven/gas-fired).  The Brussels sprout app is very good.  Would order again, and want to try the Cauliflower grantinata one next time.

This place is awesome. Our first visit we ordered a selection of cheese and meats, the beet salad, the veal ravioli and the cherry zeppole. The atmosphere is comfortable and casual, there were all ages and kinds dining.  Nummy cheese and meat! Beet salad was good and fresh, the veal ravioli was bowl licking good. (and YES he did it twice) the desert was soo good. Gorgeous little round nuggets of sweet, tender, fluffy, light, cherry goodness. I can't say enough about this place. You have to go and see for yourself. We will be back and we will eventually order everything off the menu!  Oh yea and we were out the door for under fifty dollars!",

I was blown away by 3 AMAZING appetizers that we ordered: Arancini (crispy risotto ball), the Cauliflower Gratinata & Bruxelles (brussel sprouts w/ pancetta). The Zeppole and Carmel Pears & Apples which we had for dessert were just average in comparison with the other food. Next visit I probably won't save any room for dessert. You can find pictures of all 3 apps that have been posted by various reviewers!  This place used to be a beauty parlor but doesn't resemble a pizza \"parlor\" in looks at all. No checkered red & white table cloths here! We sat out on the covered patio with vine covered walls & candles. I think sometime it would be fun to sit inside & watch the pizza-stretchers and the pizza assembly. Looking forward to going back!",

Also, on busy weekend nights they have complementary valet parking. Take advantage of it or you will not find a space. And even though it is complementary be sure to give the guys a few bucks because they are so darn polite!  The only downside is that the prices are kind of high. Not outrageously high but getting up there a little bit. Our last visit with another couple we ordered two medium pies and we each had two drinks - the bill (including 20% tip) came to $130. This is not a corner pizzeria type place so don't expect corner pizzeria prices.  Also, we took our 7 year old daughter here once and she was not a fan. Even the items on the kids menu have unusual flavoring and most kids prefer plain food. A kids personal pizza with three gourmet cheeses on it. Nope!  We let her try three different items from the kids menu and she had a hard time with each of  them.  Overall this is a great place for date night or a casual get together with friends but leave the kids at home!",

It wasn't as busy as I thought it would be at lunchtime near the busy Biltmore business area.  The space is beautiful, keeping True to many of the designs of mid-century buildings found in this area of town with a modern update.   The pizza was great.  We shared a pepperoni that was definitely cooked in a fire oven.  Delicious!  What has had me craving since that visit, however, was a starter.  We shared a cauliflower gratinata.  Yeah, that's right.  I'm craving CAULIFLOWER.  The veggies are baked with cheese and breadcrumbs.  It's just like old fashioned macaroni and cheese, but with a little bit of nutritional value to it.  All that cheese counteracts any good the cauliflower would give your body; but my reasoning suggests the lack of pasta makes this dish an awesome healthier alternative to the old comfort food staple.  I'm hooked and will be back for dinner when I can enjoy some wine with my pizza and cauliflower.",

Sometimes I wonder who slept with the devil to get the hype. In this case the hype is well founded & the Dbag patrons in full force. Everyone & I mean everyone was everywhere. They were squished in on a Friday night at prime time dinner time on a lovely 110 degree AZ day waiting in every available space inside & out.  This is reminiscent of my other hype induced bad service nightmare at another pizza place. Which left me pizza happy but not worth the 2 hour wait. Yes I said 2 hours. While I'm shaking this off all the while standing in front of the \"hostess\" station.  I realize not only did I have a whole moment & came to after said moment to see not one of the  1-2-3 women at the \"hostess\" station had awknowledged me or my hubs. DE JA freaking VU! My hopes sink to the floor & the only beacon of hope is the bar I can see packed to the gills. I'm hoping they will have a frosty beverage to make it up to my hubs. We... no he,  tries like hell to get us a couple of our fave Four Peaks brews for the 40 - 60 minute wait. He returns to me with them & I've lost myself again to a Dbacks game. I'm also doing my best sumo wrestler impression (as lady like as humanly possible) to take up as much space  so nobody horns in on my 2 seats I'm stalking.  I end up having my small victory & have some Dbag old bag ditch her \"undrinkable\" martini in a space 2x the space available next to my elbow. I move it & she looks at me like I smell bad  (& I don't) vs. saying thanks for moving your elbow. Irritating yes but for the Camelback Corridor it's expected. She was probably a \"hostess\" in her college days.  After her I put my guards that I seem to have lost recently & am perfectly oblivious to the Dbag fraction.  Enter dinner. The bartender was wonderful as a server & bartender. Very attentive & complimentary on the food choices we ordered that he liked. He made the infractions of the Dbag patron & staff disappear. We started out with & something I would highly reccomend the Polipo which was perfection. There was even enough Polipo sauce left over after our Funghi pizza to sop up with the wonderful pizza crust. The meal was ended on a sweet note with the Mixed Berry Zeppole. Just awesome through & through. On a busy busy Friday night the bar service was great, beer was cold, antipasti everything it should be, great pizza & a sweet ending. I will be back to try what I'm sure will promise to be a great meal. When I do return I'm taking a grilfriend & we're going at an off peak time (if there is one) & enjoying myself at a table. I know I'm such a rebel.",

Also a nice rotating wine list, pretty good for a pizza place.   Check the chalk board by the bar... whatever is on special is worth trying.  usually something locally grown and seasonal.  Always a good choice!  My Top Picks here: Best Pizza: Smokey.  Best Salad:  Heirloom Tomato Best Sandwich i've ever had in my life: Duck Club  Thats right... i've even been here on several occasions, all by myself, just to pop in after work, sit at the bar and indulge in the Duck Club and a pint after a long day at work.    The duck isnt gamey.  The tomato jam isnt as sweet as i expected.  (Certainly way more savory than the tomato jam that Postino's makes and uses on their bruschetta) the Bacon is thick cut and fantastic.   This is, hands down, my favorite sandwich in Phoenix.

    "text": "Solid from start to finish.  Phoenix has a ton of good pizza places with good atmospheres from federal, bianco, cibo, base, forno... the list goes on.  The parlor happy hour (3-6) features $5 red & white sangria we enjoyed!  We ordered our happy hour pizza ($7) and shared a small order of bolognese.  Everything was nice & hot with good flavor.  We tried the sauccision and pepperoni pizzas yum!  You get a half price dessert when you check in on Yelp so we had to do the chocolate bundt cake wth cherries.  Awesome whipped cream but I prefer layer cakes.  They have French press coffee or espresso drinks featuring local lux coffee my favor!  All in all, friendly and attentive service with quality food at a reasonable price.  Even off happy hour their pizzas range from $10-13 unlike some of my other trendy places that charge $20-$25 a pizza.",

My husband ordered the sausage pizza and said it was great! We also ordered a margarita pizza for our guest. There is a great selection of beer on tap. The service was excellent. We started with choices of meat and cheese served with a couple of different breads. Delicious. It was a very pleasing experience and we will certainly return. The addition of the appetizer platter and beverages did raise our bill to $100 but it is possible to enjoy the food for the reasonable $$ rating. Fresh herbs grown outside the entrance and incorporated into many of the dishes. Lovely place. Great food.",

Had a few with dinner and they were as delicious as I remember. I was meeting friends from University, a reunion of sorts and we all shared a few appetizers, pizza and salads. The Brussels sprouts and cauliflower starters were awesome. The fried calamari though took the cake and made me want to order more helpings. The Salsiccia and the Funghi were our pizzas of choice. Let's just say there were no leftovers for anyone to enjoy later. The salads were eaten up equally as quick. With a large group the service was great however the risotto bowl was a bit small however the dish itself was delicious. This is a safe smart choice for dinner, drinks and atmosphere! Check out the Parlor if you get a chance.",

    "text": "This is hands down our favorite restaurant in Phoenix. My husband took me to the Parlor on our first date here when we first met, because it was already one of his favorites. We've celebrated many anniversaries, baby announcements, and regular date nights since then at the Parlor, and here's why: the menu is both consistent and innovative. The best thing on the menu in our opinion is the Spicy BBQ Chicken Pizza, with its tangy sweet BBQ sauce and Serrano peppers. The cheese on this pizza has amazing flavor all on its own! We order this nearly every time we go because it is just so delicious. We also love the Parlor Insalata with its crunchy roasted chick peas and amazing vinaigrette. We could order this pizza and salad every time and leave satisfied (especially with the delicious seasonal cocktail menu! Always lends variety and interest even if you order the same food).   However, why stop with the favorites when there are so many delicious market and seasonal menu items? We love to find out the Market Pizza, and often decide to order one, since the ingredients are seasonal and it's always something new! The pastas are also delicious, our favorite being a winter seasonal, the Sweet Potato Gnocchi with braised short ribs--yum! Our only complaint is that once we went pretty early (during happy hour) and that particular pasta had already sold out (before 6pm!) which was a little disappointing, but shows how delicious it is!  Speaking of happy hour, plenty of good deals to be had there with affordable small pizzas and drinks that make it easier for folks like us to try new menu items while still squeezing in room for our fanorute pizza. Highly recommend this spot for a delicious dinner in Phoenix!",

It was flavorful without being overbearing. The pasta was fresh, as it's made in house. To finish, i got the tiramisu for dessert. It was the perfect end to my meal. The service was great!

We had by far the worst service we have ever experienced at this establishment today. Yep, the 5 stars are NOT a mistake, it's my way of showing appreciation to a place that really does things right and is on point, from my experience on a very consistent basis.   My husband and I love this place and come here on our dates. We have a sitter in place (shout out to my mom and dad for watching our little one so we can have some time as a couple) & naturally came to The Parlor--its our usual spot about once a month or so. We placed our order and waited.   The waiter was ok, which struck us as a little off (they usually go above and beyond immediately). We ordered the garden board (absolutely try this, it is always changing based on what is in season and that is why it's wonderful). We also ordered 2 burgers with a side salad and ranch. Our server didn't check on us and we got our burgers but no garden burger, also the salads came with a sweeter vinegrette (I really don't like sweet tasting dressings). Waiter was still no where to be found so I asked the hostess to help. She was prompt and brought me a new side salad with ranch dressing. We waited for the garden board and still, nothing. It never came. When we saw the waiter getting our bill we noticed that it took him a while.   We assumed he was removing the garden board from our check. He came to the table (finally) but NO MENTION of the garden board. This is what upset me. Everyone makes mistakes, but not owning it really doesn't set well with me.   We paid our tab and I asked the hostess if I could speak with a manager. I didn't want to complain, but they should know about this happening. I let her know we frequent the restaurant and this was certainly an anomaly. I expressed my feelings and she was very professional and polite. To my surprise after asking us to wait a sec, she gave us a voucher to come back on the house & was genuinely sorry for the experience we had.  My husband and I let her know that wasn't necessary and she politely insisted. Again Parlor, you have taken care of your customers well. Way to go and know you have a very loyal customer. Seriously my fellow Yelpers, check this place out ASAP.",

It was a busy night so we had a 15-20 minute wait, not bad considering it was a packed house.   The hostess asked of were thirsty and handed us a glass of water.  It was the best water I've ever tasted. LoL...that's the heat talking but I was so glad she offered. It was a hot one last night.   We were seated pretty quickly and our server Melissa with the amazing smile took our orders quickly.   Plain, well done, extra crispy cheese pizza... Let's see if the parlor can get the simplest pizza made to perfection.    Since each pizza is made to order we had a little downtime. 15 minutes the pizza was hot and bubbling.   My husband grabbed a slice first and his head rolled back....to my surprise he looked up and said: \"wow, this pizza just took me back to NYC\".  What...that's hard to do.  Then I took a slice....hot, crispy, amazing tangy and sweet sauce the perfect balance and the cheese was just right.    Let's not forget the tiramisu with peanut brittle on top...it had me at first bite.  This cake wasn't too sweet it was perfect for the pallet after you had a cheesy pizza and the peanut brittle was a great added crunch. Well done!   Okay, the parlor, you are definitely worthy of the best pizza in Phoenix.  I'm so glad we gave you a second chance and I will surely be returning with the crew next month.    Yelpers, I must say my first review wasn't the best on the parlor but some establishments are worth a second chance and by far...The Parlor is a third and a fourth chance.",

I don't venture too far away from some of my favorite dishes, but those dishes are amazing and I would imagine everything else is as well. The salsiccia pizza is my #1 on the menu, but if I'm going with pasta, I frequent the spicy seafood linguini or the pappardelle bolognese - both are wonderful. Another unique and flavorful pizza is the summer corn, but it is pretty spicy so beware if you're on the fence.   Service is always on point and if the option is available, I love to sit in the bar area. They don't take reservations so sometimes there's a wait, but never anything too lengthy.",

I must be honest and admit I had not stepped foot here in years, had been meaning to come back and I finally came in. I did not regret it at all, great food, awesome service from our server (Cullen) he was very patient and helpful as I had many questions lol. I could truly say it was an amazing dinner!! We ordered the the cauliflower appetizer I wish it would have been a little softer with a crust from baking but it was delish as it was very satisfying and not overwhelming to where you no longer want your main meal. Next we had  The parlor insalata I was so impressed at how flavorful and crisp it was. Also had the spicy florentine pizza and their pesto pizza add prosciutto. The spicy florentine was sooooooo good and they mean it when they call it spicy so if you don't like spicy maybe try something else. The pesto pizza was delicious as well although I would of liked the prosciutto to be a little more cooked it was too chewy for my liking, other that that the pesto was great not too much,just perfect. I dont know what their pesto is made of but I was satisfied with the flavor. Both pizzas had a crunchy crust which I always look for in a pizza, toppings were fresh..... also our server mentioned a lot of the ingredients used are picked fresh from the owners garden which is pretty awesome and quite interesting. Lastly we had the cheesecake, which was the cherry on top for this delightful dinner. Served with some type of berry compote type also some whipped cream which all together make an amazing dessert. Also the cheesecake is gluten free which is a major plus for me, this cheesecake is not your average cheesecake I highly recommend it!! Over all My return experience was superb and I am looking forward to visiting The parlor in the near future.",

Now, for me toppings are great, but I'm a carb girl at heart and there is nothing I like more than pizza crust. Unfortunately I couldn't eat any of the crust on my pizza because it was all burnt. Confused, I looked up photos on yelp to find that others had pizza crust just as charred (but no one at our table had burnt pizza). Maybe I'm unrefined and do not understand the way a fired pizza is supposed to taste like in Phoenix, but other pizzas I've tried haven't been as burnt. That aside, the environment of this establishment is pretty cool. The place is definitely bustling on the weekend, so much so that we couldn't find parking and had to park outside of the parking structure a ways away. I always like to find a positive though, and I do feel that staff here are great and they are very attentive to their diners even when it gets so busy.",

Happy hour runs from 3-6 M-F and is awesome! $8 8inch pizzas and $7 appetizers and drink specials!   The restaurant has a lot of mood lighting that makes it feel like a romantic date spot, but also a great environment for friends! Love the decor here! There is an outdoor patio that is shaded by vines, plants, and twinkling lights!   This time, we tried the bruschetta as an appetizer, and for pizzas, we ordered the market special and puttanesca. The bruschetta had eggplants that were seasoned sooo perfectly! I still prefer bruschetta from postino, but this was a great substitute. The PIZZA is ALWAYS amazing! This month's market pizza has roasted pears! YUM! I was nervous that the pizza would be too sweet, but it was the perfect combination of savory and sweet!   Parking is sometimes difficult to find, but they have a valet service.  Come check this place out! :)",

Every pizza place we go to, we always ask to switch mozzarella (boring and greasy) for ricotta (sweet, creamy, not greasy) and they treat it like it's no big deal. And the wood-fired crust one of the best we've had. Nice to have things the way you want! Parking is rough sometimes. Lunch yesterday was $35 - a little pricey with no appetizer or drinks, which is fine for dinner, but it won't be in our regular rotation for lunch. The building itself is the renovated Salon De Venus, as you've heard by now, and it's design is beautiful and cool, inside and out.",

The meat, cheese and bread board was my new addiction.. The fresh basil was a delightful compliment to the meat and cheese..  I ordered this each time we went there.. We found ourselves going x2 a week for a while! The sausage, pepperoni and basil  pizza was the best! Again, once I tried it I was hooked!!  YUMMY..    AND then it happened...  ..  I initially passed it off as maybe one of the waiters was having a bad day but then it happened 3 more times within a 2 month span.. Coincidence? Not likely.. Something has happened there.. Most of the wait staff is just plain unhappy and unfriendly..   To the Owners:  If you continue down this path you will lose your customer base..  You just lost me..",

We figured it would be a decent spot for lunch, let me tell you we greatly underestimated this place (but now I estimate it, I guess)!  It is not fancy on the outside, in fact it is easy to miss.  It is also overshadowed in the neighborhood by the Camelback location of Pizza Bianco, but I find The Parlor every bit as good, without the wait and far cheaper.  This is thin and crispy pizza so don't count on the crust to absorb all the oils, they are front and center and allow the toppings to shine.  I would recommend getting one 'regular' topiing (pepperoni or thier excellent sausage) and one of their unique creations.  The prices are decent and the happy hour special makes it a steal.",

    "text": "Oh, The Parlor, how I love you so... Hands down, this is the best pizza place in the valley. They are local, the food is backyard fresh, and the menu changes seasonally. Almost every time we have been here, they have a special of the day - a unique soup (always delicious), an exotic main course, or a specialty dessert (ordered every time). This is our go to place when we can't decide what to eat or if the In-Laws are in town. We eat here atleast once a week!   The Parlor used to be an actual hair salon, thus the play on their name. When you walk up, you are greeted by fresh herbs growing along the walkway and a giant fireplace. Once inside, it's separated with the bar on the right and the dining area to the left. The ambiance inside is low-key, semi-dark, but enjoyable. You can sit in beauty chairs (the kind with the pump, where your hairdresser can maneuver you up or down) and see beautiful pizzas made right before your eyes. I swear they've fit 15+ pizzas in the oven and while the pizzas come out fast, they are continually feeding the oven. It's amazing to watch. You can also sit outside, which is fantastic during cool weather.  The first time we came to The Parlor, it was my birthday. We ordered two pizzas, one being the Fungi (which we've ordered several more times), and a meat/cheese platter with roasted Queen Creek olives. Oh, the olives are delicious all warmed up with a hint of salt and garlic. At the end of the night, they brought me this dense chocolate cake with freshly made whipped cream and cherry sauce. This is one of their signature desserts, which is always on the menu. It was amazing and all the food was spectacular.   Since then, they've changed from their fall menu, to their winter menu, to their spring menu and every season they have signature and seasonal items. During the fall season, they had this sweet potato cheesecake with a pistachio crust. I weep every day and can't wait until this fall, in hopes that they bring it back! We've also had their Parlor Burger, where you can choose different toppings, and it comes with some of the best french fries. They make all their pastas in house and you can tell. My favorite is the seafood pasta, which has shrimp, mussels, calamari and those tiny octopi (!!) all mixed in a spicy tomato sauce. We have tried almost all the pizzas and pastas on the menu, but love trying the specials, since they are always amazing!   Finally, the wait staff is highly knowledgeable, energetic, and super quick. We had the same waiter several times (I wish I could remember his name!) and every time the service has been spectacular. Overall, I would highly recommend this place and if you're ever there, you'll probably see us!",

After hearing great things from friends and reading the great reviews, I finally made it in (they're closed on Sundays). We happened to go during Happy Hour on a Saturday and was seated right away. It wasn't crowded at all. I loved the decor and vibe of the place right away.  We ordered their cauliflower dish, which was described to us as an adult mac and cheese. It was delicious and not something I've had before. We also ordered one margherita pizza. It's a True margherita style where there's no tomato sauce but slices of tomatoes instead. While it was good, something felt missing. I think some freshly grated parmesan or hot olive oil drizzled on top would have done the trick. I'm not one to add salt to my food, but I think this pizza could have used some. I'm thinking that one of their other pizzas with toppings would do the trick.  Overall, you can't beat their Happy Hour prices. I'll definitely be back to try something else!",

    "text": "I love this place. I think the pizza is stellar. The salads are great too (though I like Postino's better for salad). The fresh house made pasta is good as well. I will say, sometimes I find the flavor combinations a little too rich. Though I'm not complaining- I just have to be in the mood for it.  Also, I feel like for a vegetarian- their pizza options are good, but not that exciting. They have a Margerhita- which I like, but many people find that a little too boring same with the pesto. They also have a Funghi, my favorite... and I think that might be it for vegetarian pizza options.   I usually order the Funghi. I like it a lot, though I went last Monday and they were very stingy with the Goat Cheese, which was a shame, because you need that tart goat cheese flavor to brighten up the richness of the truffle oil. Without enough it becomes a bit too musky. I also asked them to add arugula to it to help brighten it up. The arugula makes it much better, but still it needed more of the goat cheese. Don't get me wrong- I'm not the type that wants topping piled high- I appreciate restraint, but there just wasn't enough.   I wish they had something with a little more veg on it- like juicy sweet roasted cherry tomatoes with artichoke hearts and feta or kalmata olives with I dunno maybe kale, tomatoes and burrata...  Just a little more balanced- rich creamy, sweet, salty and fresh- gotta have some sort of green or herbaceous freshness. Yes, pesto has a green element, but pesto is more rich and pungent, not as fresh... I like fresh cutting herbaceous notes in rich food. I'm not a pizza chef though, so what do I know, but I make some killer vegetarian foods and am a gardener- so I tend to experiment a lot with this stuff. It could be my wonky taste buds...   I suppose I am just happy that there are vegetarian options at Parlor rather than salad... That seems to be my experience more often than not in Phoenix... \"Sure, we have something vegetarian- try this salad.\" Thanks jerks! No, but thank you Parlor for having vegetarian options- I apologize for my uneasy to please critiques. It's me, not you.  As I write this, I wonder if Parlor is as good as I initially said it was... ,.. ... No worries, yes, it is as good. The selections with meat are killer and unique and the crust is delicious- which to me is the foundation of a good pizza- good crust, good cheese.  It's like with song writing- forget the bells and whistles or auto-tune and beat track, if you can't make it rock with an acoustic guitar and a decent set of pipes- it's probably not that great of a song.  Anyway... It's a nice place. Maybe a little pretentious for the dude that eats Tocci's Brooklyn Style on Friday nights... ahem... I'm not talking about my boyfriend or anything. But, definitely a spot worth checking out.",

From being seated to getting our food, was about an hour. Doesn't exactly make you want to come back when you only have a short time for lunch during the workweek; its not like Bianco's where you know you have to wait 1+ hour to get a table, we were seated immediately....and then our waiter disappeared.  But the pizza will not disappoint. Also had the short rib sandwich which was quite delicious - next time I must ask for no jalapeno, because it was covered in them and so spicy on the tongue that it didn't balance well with the very tender meat and the flavours I knew were there but could not savor.  Great pizza, beautiful restaurant, poor service.  Recommended to pizza snobs who have time to take an extra long lunch - I will return then when it's more convenient.",

It was loaded with bacon, tomatoes, white cheese, avocado and garnished with a sliced hard boiled egg.  Added roasted chicken which made it a meal in itself.  Our beer was served ice cold and that's good because that is how I like my beer.  Bottom line, this place is great.  I can't wait to return for another salad and to sample something new.   Price point is a bit high but you get what you pay for: $27 for two wonderful salads (yum) $6 for adding roasted chicken $5 Guinness $4 Sierra Nevada Pale Ale Total lunch $45",

I found it to have a very tender crust.  The lamb sausage sandwich was very good too.  I'm a sucker for a roasted beet salad and that was good as well.  I had 2 complaints about The Parlor.  The first is that the majority of items have goat cheese on them.  I realize that this is currently the 'it' ingredient but I'm not a big fan.  My second complaint was the noise level.  In both the bar and the dinning room I couldn't hear a thing my husband was saying nor could he hear me.  It takes away from your dinning experience when you and your dinner date  are constantly saying 'what?'",

The actual restaurant is pretty awesome. Brick and wood and overall hipness. Great place to impress a date or just have a bite with a friend (I have done both I know.)  The food is super good. I have been a Harley's fan for awhile but have to admit this place picks up the red sauce slack. The food has always been fresh with the right amount of parsley for that fresh taste. The pizza isn't the best in town but it would make the top 10 list. They make the pasta themselves and it is delicious. Even the sea food pasta (I don't speak Italian but whatever it was called) was awesome and we are in a land-locked state. The salads are pretty amazing as well.  *****LISTEN UP OWNERS***** I am actually giving The Parlor 5-stars but holding one hostage. Why would you take the mushroom risotto out for a sweet corn one?! I haven't tried the corn yet and I am sure it is super fantastic but Virgin Mary mother of god , the mushroom one was soooo good. If you ever want to see your beloved 5th star from me you will bring it back. This is no joke. If I do not hear back in 5 days I will begin mailing you pieces of the star, but it will not end up on this review. Do it! Do it now!",

I love beets, but I don't want to take the time to prepare them, so whenever I see that item on the menu, I order it.  I was very happy with this salad.

Well, it is awesome.  carbs on top of carbs, how can you go wrong.  The best part is that they slice the potatoes so thin it is perfect.  It makes it light.  The crust is thin but has great chewiness.  Another time I had the Spicy Seafood linguini.  It was great, the portion was very generous, it was a good thing I was splitting it with a girlfriend. For dessert we split the Zeppole, which are like little donut holes, yummy, how can you not like fried dough.",

    "text": "My first time going here was on Saturday (yes, I will definitely be back!) to take my friend to her pre-birthday lunch. She had been there several times before and it is one of her most favoritist places to eat.   First off, the waiter was on the ball! I had barely sat down and he was already offering me something to drink. I love when people pay attention to their tables! It makes me teary-eyed. So anywho, I start looking at their menu, and I am completely struck by the inability to choose. So many great options, and only one brief afternoon to try something. I finally settled on the chicken salad sandwich with a side order of fries. Simply put, it was perfection. It was not glopful of mayonnaise, the chicken was flavorful, the bread was scrumptious (and I do not use that term lightly!) and the fries were exquisitely seasoned. I could not have been more pleased. And I can't wait to try the other items on their menu (and maybe save room for dessert!)",

    "text": "Oh hell yes!  Now this is what I'm talking about baby! Freshly prepared pastas, delicious inventive salads, and fancy pizza I actually like?? I must be dreaming as this simply cannot be Phoenix.  In the business of full disclosure, I'm not a fan of fancy pizza. I prefer crispy, thin crust, NJ style pizza. For The Parlor however, I make an exception. The dough is just a touch fluffy but fantastic. Each pie is cooked to a perfect crisp in their wood burning oven. Their ingredients are top notch, many of which they actually grow themselves.  I've been to The Parlor probably 4 or 5 times at this point, and I have yet to eat/drink anything that wasn't mouth-watering. Yes, the pizza and salads are great, but the pasta, holy crap THE PASTA!!! Being a young girl growing up in North Jersey, pasta (spaghetti bolognese in particular) has always been my comfort food. To the point that it's the only thing I ever bothered to learn how to cook, and I hate to cook.  But after sub-par Italian restaurant after sub-par Italian restaurant in Phoenix, I found myself cooking far more than I like. I am thrilled to say that I am have to cook no more! Because The Parlor makes one hell of a delicious bowl of Pappardelle Bolognese. The pasta is the perfect texture, practically melts in your mouth. The bolognese sauce is thick and meaty as it should be. Literally, heaven.  I always order the small size, for the reasonable price of $10, and have never once finished it. I feel like the large size may feed me for a week.  Another great thing about The Parlor is their beer and wine list. Extensive and cheap!!! And by cheap I don't mean 2 buck chuck, but I mean they don't mark up their bottles nearly as much as many of the other local establishments that I frequent, and this recession-living girl appreciates that. Huge list of beers on tap, and they serve them in pitchers. Something about a nice restaurant willing to serve me my beer in a pitcher that warms my heart, can't explain it, it just does.  I think it's fairly obvious that I am turning into a regular at The Parlor and am actually pleased about it, and if you're ever in the hood, you should be too.",

    "text": "Ok... I feel like my relationship with The Parlor has been pretty fucked up from the start. It happens.  I read a bunch (what felt like thousands of five star reviews) and so I took a really good friend there before she moved away. We had a nice time. I had some issues with the beer temperature and the very friendly but inconsistently available servers. I thought my food, while very tasty, was poorly portioned. Perhaps my expectations were too high but I feel like I had a three star experience.   I subsequently revisited The Parlor because while I don't think it's the second coming as many of my very good friends do, it's still a very cool place to grab a beer and bite.   Totally by random coincidence, on one of those subsequent visits, I happened to check my email and I had a Yelp PM from someone who pretty harshly critiqued my Parlor critique. Which is fine, except I felt like he was taking it REALLY personally so I assumed he worked there. Now, since I post my picture and I asked and he confirmed (and then later denied) he worked there, I was a little worried that my future visits could be problematic. So I took to the streets with my concerns and by that I mean the Yelp talk threads. I created a talk thread as an open letter to the owners/managers that I was concerned about this situation. I have since been informed he was let go from his position there, which I applaud hugely. I think they must have some really smart people working there who get the power of Yelp, even though most deny it, and who get customer service.   Which makes the following scenario hard for me to digest.   I was there with a group of 8 or 9 friends a couple weeks ago. We had a lovely time. Brad E spilled his beer on me. I drank it off the table. We took pictures in the chair near the bathrooms. All was good.   So at the end our evening, my portion of the bill was about $36 with tip. I had all twenty dollar bills on me and needed a little change. So I walked up to the bartender, who appeared morally strained by working on a Saturday night. Out of the 8 or 9 people with me, at least four of us commented at different times about how he was hating life. I gave him a $20. I had a second $20 in my hand. My buddy also gave him a $20. So he got our changed and walked back and gave my buddy his change and then took my second $20, which I stupidly laid on the bar, and gave me three $5s and five $1s. I didn't immediately notice the error, because let's face it, I split a pitcher. But I immediately did notice that I walked to the bar with two $20s and got back to my seat with three $5s and five $1s. So I start looking everywhere for my second $20. Pants no. Floor no. Replayed the events in my head, ahhhhh! So I walked up to him and said, \"Dude, I'm pretty sure I gave you two $20s...\" He basically just said no you didn't and walked off. So I approach the hostess and tell her the scenario and she took my number and told me that they would call me at the end of the night about whether there was an extra $20 in the drawer.   There was never a call. The hostess was totally cool about it. I don't blame her at all. The bartender was a TOTAL FUCKING JACKASS. All night and especially when this happened. I have bartended in the recent past and know that everyone has bad days (I have been the subject of a less than kind yelp about my bartending prowess). He just didn't want to be there. It's cool. I get it. I'm not saying he stole the money by any stretch. I missed the mistake at first, too. But if someone, even someone who shared a pitcher, came to me and sincerely said \"Hey, I think I might have given you a $20 before and a $20 after the change\" I'd think long and hard about whether that could be True. Because in this case, IT WAS.   So I'll be staying the fuck away and imploring my friends too as well because I feel it's cosmically just.  Though, if you don't know me and don't care about justice in the universe and are just looking for a hip place to go for dinner and you're in the Biltmore area give it a shot. I doubt my misfortune will happen to you.",

    "text": "I'm going to have to work through this review before I decide on 3 or 4 stars. I've been thinking about this since my visit and I cannot seem to come to a conclusion. Another one of those times I wish we had half star options.  The Parlor is definitely The Vig's little baby sister. It Aesthetically looks extremely similar, it has both the same Scottsdale-esque vibe and crowd, both are in weird, out-of-the way locations, and both are really loud.   Even for a new restaurant with lots of buzz on a Saturday night, I thought this place was crowded. There was over a 45-minute wait for two of us, so we ended up grabbing a beer at the bar. I'm glad we did because our bar tender was smokin hot. Nothing better for the self esteem of two broken-hearted girls than a cute, flirty bartender.   After a while we just decided to eat at the bar and skip the whole table idea. Good choice, even though the bar area was REALLY loud.   On to the food... we started out with the cheezy cauliflower appetizer. OH MY GOOD LORD. It was amazing. It was topped with bread crumbs and baked... it was just absolutely amazing. It was good later as a midnight snack and good as breakfast the next morning.   For dinner we shared a Pesto and a Margharita pizza. I loved both of them, but the Margharita had more flavor and I preferred it over the Pesto. Both had great quality ingredients and were extremely tasty.  I'm pretty stoked that the prices are so reasonable. Two hours, five beers, an appetizer and two pizza's later, we ended up with a bill for $50 plus tip. My solo bar tabs are normally higher than that!  My major complaint, though, was the whole entire time I was there I had a stuffed nose. I don't know if it was an allergy to something they were cooking, the wood, flowers, etc but I could barely breathe. The second we stepped outside it was like I had a new nose.  Man.. I still don't know... three ... four... three ... four... okay .. my decision is made: if the 6' tall snobettes coming into the bathroom as we were walking out didn't smash rudely into my dining partner and act like she was Antichrist for trying to inhabit the same place at the same time, I would definitely go with a 4 but it's a 3 for now until things settle down a bit.",

    "text": "Audrey & I met Kevin & Marian at The Parlor for dinner.  Since they don't take reservations we waited about half an hour in the bar.  The bar area is nice and the service was good.  It was very crowded and noisy.    The Parlor has a nice selection on tap including a couple of my favorites, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and Four Peaks Kilt Lifter.    Between the outdoor seating area, the bar and the open yet warm restaurant I had a sense that this was a place the cool kids would hang out.  This was confirmed when I remembered that Kevin & Marian were there with us.  Further confirmation of the cool kid factor was provided when Ayesha and Amber were discovered at the bar a bit later.    We shared a couple orders of the Arancini appetizer which was excellent in flavor and textural complexity with a delicious sauce.  When our server commented that he didn't think anyone else in the valley offered these I had to think back to the last time I had them.  It was on Long Island at a family Italian place called Blue Moon in Rockville Centre.  Kudos to The Parlor.  I ordered the barbecue chicken pizza.  Between the blending of sweet and savory flavors, the tender pulled chicken, the roasted serrano chili's...this is good stuff.  It doesn't hurt a bit that it is made on a wood fired crust that has a great firmness and consistency.  Sitting here writing about it...I may have to go get the leftovers for breakfast.  brb. . . . I'm back.  Even cold that was awesome pizza.  Note to self:  hot coffee does not cool the burning much when you get several slices of serrano together. . . . I also sampled Kevin's pizza and Audrey's burger.  Both excellent.  The parmesan fries were dare I say it...better than the fries at FEZ.  The service was top notch throughout the meal.  We finished by sharing a slice of tiramisu.  Made with mascarpone cheese as it should be, nice flavors of rum, coffee, etc coming through.  I also had a coffee.  Single serving (probably about 16oz) french press.  Again, excellent.    So there it is...5 stars.  I started out at 4 stars because...maybe I'm a little stingy with my 5 stars.  But what could I knock off a star for?  Umm...honestly I can't really think of anything that stood out wrong.  The Parlor has a fairly simple and straightforward menu which...at least on this Saturday night...they executed flawlessly.",

There was a short wait for a table in the dining room, but we found some seats at the bar and decided to sit there instead. Oops. Although there were at least 4 bartenders behind the bar and they weren't busy they were all standing around and chatting and pretty much ignored those trying to order. Finally one of them came over to take our order. Luckily there were many of them behind the bar because the girl we ordered from was almost nonexistent for most of the night.   The pizza was so good. Thin and cheesy with a crispy crust.   We will absolutely have to try the meat and cheese plate and the arancini next time. They both looked yummy.   Cool, sleek and clean atmosphere. I love the recycled wood.   I also love the herb garden near the entrance (I'm currently trying to not kill my own) and the patio looks like the perfect spot to eat and drink once the nights cool down around here. I'd love to just have a meat and cheese plate out there with a glass of wine and just relax.",

The salad was fresh and had a great mixture of veggies. We loved the crispy chickpeas.   The pasta was very good, great flavor, plenty of pesto, a little light on the chicken and portion but it was a small size. We quickly went through the one piece of bread, and used the crust of the pizza to soak the rest of the pesto up.   The pizza was excellent, great combo of flavors and the crust was spot on.

Second of all, the ambiance is one of those cool, organic  places that makes you feel both hip and sophisticated. It's pretty small, and even though it's right off of Camelback, you'd drive right past it if you didn't know what to look for. Apparently it actually was a beauty parlor at one time (thus the name), and the original architecture reflects that. The food is phenomenal. Salads to pizzas to burgers. Soo tasty. Happy hour prices are decent. Be forewarned that this is a popular spot, so if you go at lunch, make it earlier or later than usual. Both indoor and outdoor seating available. A cozy bar. And a small vegetable garden borders the entrance as you walk in. I've been here many times and never been disappointed. Go! Go now!",

    "text": "I realized I broke a self-imposed rule with my previous review of this place: I sampled (and thoroughly enjoyed) a pasta dish, and then added this place to my Pizza list.  Without ever actually tasting the pizza.  So last night, I made that right.  I got a pizza.  YUMM-O!  I ordered the 8\" Smokey, and sampled a slice of my friend's Puttanesca (sp?), and found both to be excellent.  The cheese on my pizza was as smoky as suggested by the name, and the seafood pizza had a lemon-y flavor that complemented the spice nicely.  I'd highly recommend either, but I think the rest of the table would suggest that the Smokey is the better choice.    Also: try the Basil Vodka Gimlet.  At $11, it's a splurge, but basil fans, this is your drink!  I tried a fruit mash, which had plums muddled in it, and enjoyed it, but the gimlet was pretty amazing.    We also ordered dessert, which I think were \"share sized.\"   I loved the crostada, as i believe it was called, with vanilla gelato over a fruit-filled pastry crust.  I felt it to be the perfect summer dessert, as opposed to the more traditional Italian chocolate- or espresso-based desserts filling out the dessert menu.  They also have other gelatos, which I'm looking forward to sampling in the future.    Our service was good but not quite great, the restaurant was slightly more busy than on my previous visit, being later in the evening.  It had cleared out mostly by the time we left, however. Anyway I continue to really enjoy this place and look forward to returning.",

    "text": "I went here about two weeks ago with a fair-sized group of my coworkers, and was not disappointed.   The restaurant is a little tricky to spot and turn into, if you don't know what the outside of the building looks like...here's a brief description! It is a little red and white building, with a small, low-to-the ground sign...it's on the north side of the street, after the complex with the Chipotle and Corelone's.   I see a lot of complaints about the parking, but my party and I dined during a considerable lunch rush and didn't experience any difficulties navigating the parking lot or finding a space.   We walked in to find a moderately full restaurant...and only marginally capable staff. The girl at the front in charge of seating was curt and rude upon our arrival, but changed her tune when she realized we had a reservation. Once we were seated, however, the rest of the staff was great and it was easy to forgive the girl's lack of pleasant customer service and competency. In other words, don't be put off by an icy first-face, if you encounter it.   A note: in order to secure a reservation, you must have a party of ten. However, they will seat you if your party has only partially arrived. Just a hint! Our whole party did eventually arrive, but they were happy to seat us with just 3.   The inside of the restaurant is \"hip.\" I liked the level of lighting inside and loved the bar chairs.   Between all of us at the table, I think we tried a little bit of everything, and everyone seemed very pleased with the pricing and quality of the pizza and other entrees. I myself ordered the Yukon Gold pizza, which is very similar to the potato pizza found at Humble Pie. Just as tasty, no better and no worse, which is definitely praise considering how much I love Humble Pie's version. The pizza was a little charred, but I don't know that I've had a pizza with this kind of crust that wasn't a bit on the blackened side.   I didn't see any \"cougars\" or \"DBs,\" but, then again, I was there at lunch time. I mostly saw nondescript professionals and a few gabbing girlfriends with \"My Sister's Closet\" bags. I'm not sure that I completely understand the scorn about the restaurant being \"found out\" and \"taken over\" - are you really going to dinner to catalogue the other patrons? Weird...!   I'm sure, whatever kind of person you are, you will fit in just fine.",

If that was True, they could easily harvest whole garden in a day. . . and vegetables do not magically mature and ripen overnight, particularly in winter months. Plus, who wants to eat  veggies from garden uncouth customers sometimes use as an ash tray or trash can for gum wrappers, etc.?  Terrific food, ludicrous backstory.",

Of course, we had to try this new place called The Parlor. No one had ventured to try this Pizzeria and my visit was the perfect excuse.  5 words: Antipasti meat and cheese selection.   Grilled Rosemary Flatbread, Basil Pesto and Peperonata. We chose some smoked prosciutto, bleu cheese and then a bleu cheese/jack combo, I think. Quite tasty. Of course I tried a pizza and a chocolate cake for dessert but both are a blur since my brain only wanted to remember the Antipasti.",

They literally brought out the pasta and a separate bowl with raw spinach leaves.  I asked the waitresss...why isn't the spinach cooked nor INSIDE the pasta...no adult would eat just plain dry spinach leaves let alone a kid. She said the cooks yell at her and get moody when people try to tweak the kids menu.  I'm completely blown away by the audacity of the kitchen to send out food like that.  So kids are like pets...you'll eat whatever I feel like or not feel like doing.  I sent it back and she returned about 15 seconds later with the leaves stuffed inside the pasta...still raw and uncooked.  I can only imagine how much \"care\" is going on inside the kitchen to make the rest of the \"gourmet\" meals.",

My table shared the pappardelle bolognese and actually ended up ordering another portion. I recommend the roasted brussels sprouts - something tells me they have a ton of butter in them, but that is probably why they were so tasty. Unfortunately, no one at the table liked the pizza. We ordered the margherita. The tomatoes were tasteless and the house made mozzarella was so so. The crust was burned on the edges and soggy in the middle. We ended up ordering a side of tomato sauce to help give the pizza more flavor.   We would go back for the fresh pasta but most likely skip the pizza.",

Herb garden lining the sidewalk, bar windows wide open, fireplace straight ahead and an interior that may rattle my heavenly friend, St. Francis. Get it? Heavenly? Saint?   Um...well...anyhoo...the few times I've been there was always that awkward post lunch-pre dinner time (around 2ish)...we were always greeted and seated immediately. That can be an easy time to be forgotten in a restaurant.  I had dreams about the Pesto Pasta after my first visit. It was weird. Pesto Pasta and I were on a cruise where Chaz Bono was performing Send In The Clowns. She kept throwing chunks of Parmesan at us from the stage calling us Parlor Gays. Then a huge unicorn came from above and ate her.   I don't know what that means. But that has to be one full unicorn.   Spinach salad and calamari are big weiners here...wait, I mean, winners here. Winners. Love the tropical ice tea. Service was a solid B+. LOVE the 2 price options on the pasta dishes. I try to eat my cheat foods in fist size portions. Ok. No fist jokes from the randy gays.

    "text": "We headed out for a night with a bunch of friends before a large meeting the next day. The bar area is spacious and separate from the main dining room. However this is a more modern take on restaurants so lots of concrete & a bit of wood. Think echo-y and a bit of noise. If you are good with it, happy dining, if you want something a bit more intimate you may want to consider off hours or another place.   Happy hour is definitely worth hitting as the pricing per pint for one of the nice selection of beers was nice especially being in this portion of Phoenix where just to be close to the Biltmore costs more. I am pretty sure they charge more for the water in this area of Phoenix...but I digress.   Now to be fair, we did have a variety of nosh like things. Including a margarita pizza which was above average. But honestly I can't say it was memorable or that I am still salivating over my slice. The pasta was good and had a nice blend of spice, sun-dried tomato's and pork in whole wheat pasta. I would order it again.   Over all, it was an average experience. The management did a great job in taking care of us after an unfortunate miss understanding with one of the staff. It is tough with many fantastic restaurants in the area I think it may be a while before I go back.   Don't sit at the bar, go enjoy the dining side or one of the high top tables. Not great for large groups(8 or more) or parties. Many friends did say this was a place they like to go, but it was usually a couples or double date kind of place. I am all about locally owned and will always recommend over a chain. Happy dining.",

We ordered the puttanesca pizza, seafood on a pizza which sounded really good, pepperoni pizza for the kids and a spinach salad. The highlight was definitely the spinach salad, great bold taste, the dressing was good and the chucks of cheese and bacon were bold and full of flavor. The puttanesca pizza looked very delicious which included shrimp, calamari, spicy sauce, capers, and fennel. It turned out to be ok, nothing to write home about but I did eat four slices.  Maybe it was ok because it sounded so good on the menu and it didn't translate to taste? The kid pizza had giant pepperoni and they loved it finishing the whole thing. While I can't say the pizza was great it was ok, I will definitely be back to try other pizzas and the duck sandwich - it looked great from across the table when others ordered it.",

They use local sausage. Their Parlor salad (I hope I am calling it the right name) has fried chick peas and salami with very fresh letttuce and a delicious light dressing that reminds me of my aunt's (olive oil/vinegar).  A nice wine selection and seasonal items, I remember a grape (or maybe it was some other fruit) olive oil cake that I would order again.  Also have tried their wide pasta with red meat sauce that is very homey and delicious. It used to be a hair salon and ironically my mum used to have her hair done here back in the day when it was Salon de Venus.

Check out the naked lady wallpaper in the bathrooms.  I hear it's owned by the same people who brought us Nello's. Not a bad association at all.  I am probably biased by the fact that it's within stumbling distance from me, but this is one of my favorite happy hour and lunch spots in Phoenix. Everything I've tried on the menu has been impressive. Of course, because I myself am tacky-yet-unrefined my choices only have gone as far as pizzas, but pizza in itself can obviously pose a great challenge.  Go and enjoy.",

The restaurant is decorated in a modern yet warm fashion and they strategically make a small space seem large to fit in a generous amount of people without feeling cramped. It is a pleasant environment and comfortable setting inside as well as outside on the patio.   The first time I came here years ago was with my best guy friend who had been raving about it. We had the duck club, cauliflower app, and tiramisu; each dish was absolutely delicious, and we left happy and full. This friend of mine will not eat veggies or anything even remotely healthy, and he couldn't get enough of the cauliflower...that speaks volumes of how good it was.   Most recently I came here on a date and we ate on the patio during happy hour. Their prices during happy hour are incredible; we got 2 pizzas, a salad, and an app for under $40. The portions are decent, so we left with to go boxes and lunch for the next day! The pizzas were great and cooked perfectly, and the salad and app we had were good as well.   This is the perfect place for a casual dinner with friends or a nice little date night. You can get a great meal for a decent price.",

I work in the area and have been to this place for lunch, and the dinner experience was right on!  The Parlor.    We stopped by on Saturday night around 7:00.  They have parking in the back and we were seated right away.  The place is dark, but lit very well and had a beautiful environment.  Our server's name was Eddie and he did a great job waiting on our table.  The service was spot on.  On to the food.....We ordered the Calamari and Shrimp as our appetizer, and the house pizza for dinner.  The calamari and shrimp was delicious, very tender with a light batter.  The pizza was outstanding.  It was very flavorful and the ingredients really shined though.  The kale was crisp, and bacon was salty and the cheese was savory, perfect combination!  To top off the great meal, the head chef recognized my wife and offered us free dessert, we had the chocolate cake, which was delicious!  Overall, very solid meal and prices were very reasonable.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone.    On a side note, the building itself doesn't look like a restaurant so you might drive by it and not realize it's a restaurant.  Check this place out, you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I've wanted to try this Italian restaurant since reading a list of glowing reviews on Yelp. During our visits, the modern interior included a semi-closed patio, a full bar, TV, open kitchen, and a spacious dining area with natural lighting and wooden decor. The atmosphere was cozy and conducive to all occasions.   During our initial visit, we tried the 8-inch Funghi pizza ($7) prepared with roasted mushrooms, goat cheese, truffle oil, and chive. The generous amount of mushrooms was impressively stacked with great textures. The minimal amount of goat cheese was perfect for this particular pizza, as the light truffle oil and chive provided depth of flavors to accompany the crispy crust that came with a consistent crunch on every bite. Terrific combination of earthy flavors, it was by far the best mushroom pizza I have tried so far.   We also had the Puttanesca pizza ($7) that came with calamari, shrimp, capers, spicy tomato sauce, olives, fennel, and calabrian chile. Wow. The firey spicy flavors gave a great balance to the sweet cheeses, salty capers and olives. The fennel added texture, and the handful of calamari and shrimp were delicious. The crust again, was crispy with a light crunch, and flavorful. I wished there could be more seafood added to the pizza, but the combination of flavors were unsurpassed.   Next, the Vine Ripe Margherita pizza ($7) made with fresh vine ripe tomato, house made mozzarella, basil, and olive oil. Unlike other pizzerias, the flavor of basil was persistent and well integrated into every bite. I absolutely loved the taste of the olive oil on this pizza, and the melted thick mozzarella cheese was another that highlighted our meal.  On our second visit, we wanted the 8-inch Funghi pizza ($7.50) again, but this time the experience was not as outstanding as the previous. The toppings were excellent and full of flavor, but the crust was unexpectedly soft and rubbery. Since their crust was just a touch thicker when compared to Bianco, Cibo, Federal, and Pomo, it should have cooked with a little more time to bring out the char and crunch in the flavorful crust.  We also tried the Pesto pizza ($7.50) accompanied by roasted tomato, house made mozzarella, basil pesto, and pine nuts. Like the Funghi, the crust was disappointing, but this turned out to be my favorite pizza. The roasted tomato was juicy, flavorful, and came with a nice char. The house made mozzarella was excellent, especially when combined with the basil, garlic, and olive oil infused pesto sauce, and a handful of pine nuts. In subtle ways, the use of the olive oil was a good unifier to bring together an array of ingredients and flavors.   For dessert, the Tiramisu ($4 with Yelp check-in) was moist, airy, with crushed toffee added for texture in-between each bite. I wished the Tiramisu could come with a hint of liquor, but it was still a wonderful way to end a meal. Santi seemed to enjoy the White Sangria ($5) much more than the Red.   Their happy hour goes from 3-6pm daily, and the restaurant recently raised their prices by about 50 cents. Despite some inconsistencies in our experiences, I still consider this a viable option for those looking for gourmet pizzas at happy hour prices. Service was helpful, attentive, but distanced on the first visit, and lukewarm on the second. Interested diners should consider coming during the first half of the happy hour when there is ample parking available. Good for groups, families, and date nights. Reviewing this restaurant is making me to want to return soon. I would love to try their brunch items and other pizzas in the near future.",

The crust was cooked perfectly, and the flavor was one of the best pizza flavors that I ever had.  (I'm a vegetarian, so my ordering options were limited.)",

It's not too serious about itself though and you know that they're all about good food.   I've tried their fritto misto, the burger, their pizza and the braised short ribs pasta (Sweet potato gnocchi)  The fritto misto here is done right. Calamari and shrimp lightly battered to perfection topped with some seasoning to add that little extra bit of flavor. A good appetizer portion without ruining the main course.  The parlor burger here can be customized to three options of your choice. They're all excellent. The brioche bun and garlic aoli are incredible here and the party is a very generous and well made offering. The accompanying garlic fries are very garlicky and crisp, just the way they should be.  Finally the Sweet potato gnocchi. This pasta is something I daydream about often. A very generous portion of meat with in-house pasta it'll leave you wanting a second stomach to order another large portion. For those with smaller appetites you can order the large and have left overs (my suggestion) or they do offer a smaller portion that should be just right.  Definitely come here. The food is second to none. They also change up their menu every so often so if you don't want to be disappointed call head and ask about their food!  The atmosphere here is good for a casual date but you could also definitely come here for a nicer date. It sort of straddles the middle between fancy and nice-casual.",

A friend and I split the mozzarella in carrozza, which was beautifully presented - crispy housemade mozzarella topped with frisee, radicchio, mixed greens, wrapped in prosciutto like a giant rosebud, dressed with parmigiano vinaigrette. Visually stunning and the perfect starter. The salsiccia pizza (sausage, grilled radicchio, sage, saba) earned the Parlor #1 pizza on the Food Network and is quite tasty, slightly sweet and savory. Friend loved her papardelle bolognese and polished it clean. Other bestsellers include the duck club and the Parlor burger.  No rezzies, so be prepared for a wait during peak!

It was 9:45 and we realized we were the only two in the place and apologized, they said we could stay longer if we liked.

Pastas - they have a great selection including a squid ink pasta, pappardelle, cavatelle, etc. All excellent. Maybe could have used a touch more seasoning, but was flavorful nonetheless.

We ordered four items here, the tomato and melon salad, the heirloom margherita pizza, the pappardelle bolognese, and the tiramisu. The tomatoe and melon salad was my biggest surprise. The salad was sweet and refreshing and the perfect dish for a hot day in Phoenix. The pizza was the most average dish out of all and it wasn't even bad. Just the least memorable of everything. The pappardelle was another good dish, basically a spaghetti bowl with thicker pasta that was perfectly al dente. The tiramisu was one of the best tiramisu I've had at a restaurant, it came with this brittle that was sprinkled on top and just made the dish. Giving it texture that really made this dessert stick out.",

We took a couple of minutes to order, deciding on the watermelon salad, and three small pizzas each.

The Parlor was highly rated, so I decided to check in and get in line on the Yelp app. After reading such good reviews my expectations were set pretty high for this restaurant. I was not disappointed!  The ambiance in this establishment is very warm and welcoming. Dim lights with faint almost inaudible music in the background. Our waiter was very friendly and offered suggestions on cocktails,appetizers, pizza, and desert. We ended up getting the fritto misto (aka calamari) paired with their take on the classic Last Word cocktail called the Newton. The two paired great together and both were super delicious!  So their pizzas are wood fired pizzas and are some of the best I've tried in the valley! Based on our waiters suggestion we got the Funghi and the Salsiccia. My personal favorite was the Funghi but both put me in pizza heaven! To top everything off we finished with the tiramisu which was heavenly!  All in all, the ambiance, pizza, and great service definitely make this place a 5 star experience for me. I can't wait to come back! If you're going on the weekends be sure to check in on the app to skip the long lines!",

    "text": "Seated quickly but went before the dinner rush. Great atmosphere, very trendy decor with warm lighting.   Service was okay. After our initial drink order and then food we never saw our waiter again. The people who brought our pizzas ended up getting us drinks. Not a big deal, overall experience wasn't impacted.   Drinks were perfect, all three that we tried were balanced and had their own Parlor twist on them. Old fashion was traditional, served with the large ice cube (didn't have to request it). St. James was tart and subtly sweet, pear vodka made it a fun twist. Collins was good, it's pink and dangerous because it goes down so easy.   Started with Fritto Misto. Good mix of shrimp and calamari. They weren't very crispy and the sauce was good but not great. We won't order again but I know it's a typical favorite so you may want to try for yourself. We may just have had a bad batch.   Pizzas were excellent. Good char and crispy crust all the way to the center of the pizza. Pepperoni's are larger with fresh mozzarella and basil, traditional but good - it's definitely above any delivery pepperoni you may get (except maybe Spinatos!). We really wanted a summer corn with Calabrian chili pizza but it's out of season so we built our own. We added sausage, garlic, mushrooms and Calabrian chili. The mushrooms are so meaty we should have just done them or the sausage, not both. Calabrian chili didn't pack that much heat, we hoped for more but it was still good. Sausage was very flavorful but overpowers the other ingredients on the pizza, keep it simple if you add sausage or just order one of their speciality pizzas to get the flavor balance right.   It was a fun place, good pizza and great drinks. It's not huge so definitely recommend making reservations. Right now it's also a little hard to find with the construction, look for a simple white sign with Parlor just spelled in black.",

It comes with all these pickled vegetables and some crispy kale on top, which go perfectly with the pizza. Adding some hot sauce takes it over the edge! I've also had their pasta and it was decent, but I'd say the pizza is better. They have deal days Mondays I think and maybe tuesdays too, with a pitcher and pizza for 20. I've also tried some of their specials for pizza and I've never been disappointed.  The atmosphere is pretty cool. Casual pizza vibes, in an old hair salon with 60s architecture. The bar area is intimate and social with those long tables that you sit with people that you do t know sometimes and start to make friends. Their bar is pretty legit as well. This is the place where I tried Papi -it was fine but I don't think lives up to the hype. All the drinks they've made for me have been strong and goo",

Reading the yelp reviews made me want to try the pesto pizza with sausage and the pasta looked legit.    The waiter seemed to suggest that the pesto pizza wasn't always available since it's not on the menu but they did make it for me so I was happy.   We also got the pasta with bolognese sauce. There are two serving sizes of pasta and we got the regular sized (lower priced of the two). I was sort of worried about the serving size because I saw others complain. When we got our food I was actually surprised by the amount of food because it was totally more then I thought it'd be.  20 bucks for a 12\" pizza is high when you're comparing it to most pizza chains but in the gourmet pizza world it's not bad at all. I wouldn't have been able to eat it all by myself. If you're eating light I could see sharing one pizza with nothing else as feasible.   The pasta serving was not bad. We thought we ordered the larger size by accident so at least with the type of pasta we ordered the serving size was fair.   Price wise, I think it's fair. When it comes to service they were totally nice and attentive.   In terms of taste - the pesto pizza was unique and enjoyable. The pasta was also good. We were both definitely full and happy with the meal and we'll be back so that's the stamp of approval for me.   The yelper that recommended the pesto with sausage was the real mvp. It was definitely better than biancos. Up there with CIBO and POMO in my book.",

    "text": "Four adults and a toddler show up for a late dinner to have some food and enjoy ourselves a little.  Total success!  Though the Yelp page said \"no\" under good for kids when we checked, it totally was.  They asked if we wanted a high chair (yes) and the waiter was brilliant about getting something to eat out fast for my nephew.  He dug the butter parmesan spaghetti noodles (not on the menu, but suggested by our waiter)!  As others suggested, I had the beet salad with goat cheese.  Spot on!  A well done dish.  I also enjoyed my main, the butternut squash risotto.  I also highly recommend the roasted olives - my first time ever having hot olives, and it worked splendidly!  Roast banana and chocolate gelato scoops make a nice combo to finish it all off.  I'd have loved to try one of the signature cocktails, but didn't happen tonight.  The ambience was kinda hip and noisy enough to make having a kid with you ok, but not too noisy to make it uncomfortable.  No reservations accepted, and they claimed a 15 minute wait, but we were seated within 5.  The only thing keeping them from a 5 star was some slight errors on the waiter's part, like bringing fries only instead of fries and a caesar salad as ordered, or forgetting a spoon or enough boxes for the (ample) leftovers.  I'd go back.",

It might have been the best salad I have ever had and would STRONGLY urge them to put that on their regular menu!  I usually get the Funghi (wild mushroom, goat cheese and truffle oil) pizza- but was glad I got the special!",

Arie Mei son of the old line Nello's pizza family best know in Tempe has taken on this venture with a twist. Fresh farm raised and home made ingredients.  With parking in the lot behind you have a choice of either sitting inside at the bar with the salons original chairs or outside near a wood fired chimnea. The staff was very friendly and knowledgable.  I came there with friends and order a salade and make it the way you want it pizza.  They  are reasonable priced. Crust was crisp and with flavor. We orde the fresh mozarella, basil and oregano with home made red tomatoe sauce.   Teas was the beverage for lunch. The menu is the same for dinner.  You might change up you choices from the LGO and it's long line for this gem.  I look forward to another trip to try there homemade pasta and other dishes.",

Starting with the location, excellent spot, very centric and near everything in central Phoenix.  The facade with the star wall is excellent marketing and identity management technique since they also use it as a brand stamp throughout, also really cool looking.  Entry is cute with the little organic veggie gardens growing.  Inside is cute although the chairs in the main tabled dining area were rather uncomfortable.  Waiter was good, and a great atmosphere, pretty people, a good place to go on a date.  Now the good stuff.  We tried two pizzas 12 in.  The marguerita was delicious n very stretch melty cheese, fresh basil and warm juicy tomatoes on the crispy clean dough was excellent.  Tried the Funghi pizza and was VERY delicious!  The special and delicate flavors of the wild mushroom and truffle oil came out nicely and were the centerpiece of the pizza.  They are a bit pricey, and honestly considered going to oreganos down the road for bigger bang for the buck, but stayed to humor our craving for  some high priced gourmet pizza.  Beats Picassoz blandness any day.  Definitely recommend it for going on a date, or hanging out with a pretty, cool friend.  :)",

Currently their web site doesn't display their menu or have any pictures, if it had; I would have gone sooner.  The pizza is fantastic, better than Bianco's, Cibo's, or Grimaldi's.  The specialty pizzas are unique and I can't wait to try each one.  The French fries are great, tossed with a parmesan-parsley mix for a nice flavor, yet the menu doesn't do anything to describe or showcase these delicious spuds.  The only reason I knew to order them is other reviews.  Wait staff was good, hostess was not.  I guess I'm just used to a hostess that smiles and makes you feel welcome when you walk in.   I'll definitely be back.",

Walking in this place made me think of the Vig because the decor is very similar.  The food and drink menu looked great.  I was really hungry and started out with the bruschetta and a watermelon agua. The drink was light and refreshing, not too sweet, and you can tell that they use fresh watermelon juice instead of that pucker crap. The bruschetta mix had a sweet taste to it that I didn't like but nothing that salt and pepper couldn't fix. My sister ordered the grinder and I ordered the pepperoni pizza because our waiter suggested it. I took a bite out of my sisters sandwich and it was very plain but the french fries were awesome. My pepperoni pizza was greasy and burnt. I wasn't impressed. The Parlor didn't live up to its hype and everything here looks great but doesn't deliver.",

Over the last few weeks I have checked out every hip pizza place in the entire Valley in a quest to find the best pie of the moment.  Last week I heard about The Parlor from Mr. Bob McClendon who told me that aside from Chris Bianco's place, it was his favorite pizza place of the moment.  (McClendon supplies produce to both establishments).  Let me tell you that The Parlor is going to give Pizzeria Bianco some majorly stiff competition.  The Parlor gets my vote for best pizza in the Valley because while their pies are just as fabulous as Biancos, The Parlor has an ultra cool interior, and most importantly, less of a wait time (at least for now).  I checked out The Parlor yesterday for lunch and despite a pretty full house I found the service to be absolutely wonderful...then again maybe they were just fussing over me a bit because I was eating solo and preggers....",

To be fair, the pasta I had was amazing... but then they took it off the menu. Just so you know, the chestnut and sheep's milk raviolini fandango that you will never have blew my mind thrice over and now it's gone forever. Dead.   Here's the part that didn't work out: the pizza. What the deuce? It's a pizza place that's supposed to have great pizza. 0/3 liked it. The tomato sauce was weird and clashed with the toppings, the crust was forgettable, and I didn't finish it. And I am a human garbage disposal in the presence of fancy pizza.

My friends ordered from the very unique cocktail menu and we started with an antipasti plate with meat/cheese.  Very high quality and amazing tapenades to accompany the selections we made.  Nice start.    We each ordered something different and mine was delicious - the arugula/beet/goat cheese salad.  It was exceptionally fresh and the dressing was mild but perfect to highlight the other elements in the salad.  My friends were equally impressed with their dishes.

One of the reasons I had avoided coming in was worry about parking and size.  Not to worry, it was fine!  Husband was happy to get an italian beer, I was happy with a nice cocktail.  Our salads were delicious and very large (the small is perfect for one person for a meal, esp with meat).  Husband was very happy with his personal size pizza (happy hour for the win!).  Dessert was lovely; I loved the little donuts (cherry) with caramel sauce.  It was heavenly!  This is great place to come as a group or for a family outing since it's easy to do sharing.  A large salad could be a side for about 4-6 people, I would say.  The smaller version could cover about 3.  Certainly a place we'll recommend when the whole family is in town over Christmas and is looking for a place to eat.",

The entry is surrounded by greenery and white lights which sets a lovely, romantic tone. When you enter, there is a cute bar area to the right and the dining room to the left. They have a bartop at the edge of the dining room and the \"Barstools\" are actually like beauty parlor chairs complete with footrests - very fun! I've come in just for dessert and drinks with a girlfriend and this is the perfect place to perch :)  The pizzas are amazing - thin, bubbly crust with fresh, high quality ingredients. We usually get one or two to share alongside a few additional items from the menu. A couple favorites are the Pesto (which has pine nuts - yum!), Funghi (I'd prefer that the mushrooms were more finely chopped for texture purposes, but the flavors were super good), and the Pepperoni.   Now, regarding the other stuff: DUCK CLUB. Ohmygoodness-sodelicious. Duck + bacon + red wine tomato jam = super amazing flavors. Definitely order this.  We've also tried a few pastas, my favorite of which was the Parsnip Gnudi with brussels sprouts and other veggies - it was served as a small stew and my 1 year old son absolutely loved it.   Desserts are often interesting and they seem to change pretty regularly. We had ordered the Corn Zeppole which comes with spicy chile mascarpone and those were interesting and pretty yummy. The turtle budino was tasty, but I wished for something crunchier with it for texture.I had also had the citrus cream crepes which I didn't love as the citrus cream was a bit overpowering.   I had one of their cocktails last summer (which I can't remember the name of) and it was tasty, refreshing, and a generous size.   Service has always been pretty on point and accommodating, even when we've stopped in later at night.   The parking situation is annoying (I hate tiny parking lots that require you to valet) and I REALLY wish they'd take reservations as the wait on weekend evenings can get a bit ridiculous.",

We split a parlor insalata, which was also excellent. When it came to pizza, we went with the pesto and the salsiccia. Omg! The sausage, radicchio and sage combination is amazing! The only thing better than our food was our server, Tammy. What a gem she is! She gave us awesome food recommendations and paced our meal perfectly. It's clear that she knows what she is doing.

We ordered the bruschetta, angello, funghi, and spicy barbecue chicken pizza.  The bruchetta had eggplant on it and I loved it! It had a lot of balsamic vinegar on it and it was full of flavor.  All the pizzas were good, but my favorite was the funghi, mushroom pizza.  There were several kinds of mushrooms on it, so it was very fragrant and definitely not your average mushroom pizza.  It was my friend's birthday, so she got a free dessert and a birthday discount!   I would definitely go again, but will make reservation since it's such a popular restaurant!",

    "text": "I was planning on writing a bad review of a different restaurant near The Parlor and the first thought that popped into my mind was that on top of many other problems, that restaurant suffers from being in relatively close proximity to Parlor.  So I thought that rather than put another nail into that place (empty on a Friday at 7:30, though highly rated with a very limited # of  suspect reviews and I might still review it), I would praise Parlor and feel better about myself for it.   I have been to The Parlor maybe a dozen times, maybe 20 times. Simply put, the food here is excellent. The changing menu shows creativity not done for creativity's sake, but rather for the purpose of offering excellent food.   I will try food here that I've never had before, never heard of before, wouldn't ordinarily order in another restaurant. The kitchen at the Parlor simply executes as well or better than any other comparably priced places (and many, many, many higher priced restaurants). Happy Hour is an absurdly good deal.  As far as recommendations, I really like the funghi pizza. Beet salads with goat cheese are usually a \"been there, done that\" dish, however Parlor's is the best example you will find anywhere. What you really have to try though is some of the pasta. Be adventurous and try something you've never had or wouldn't ordinarily consider. Desserts are also great.    If you're looking for Olive Garden, there is certainly one near you. If you are looking for great food and great atmosphere, do yourself a favor and check out The Parlor.",

    "text": "There are a lot of pizza joints in the Valley, and reading the reviews of each one, you'd think they all serve the best pizza in town.  The Parlor is no exception.  I didn't think The Parlor would be the best in town, but it had one thing going for it: the menu.  I like their space.  It's not as quaint as Cibo or Bianco, but it has a far nicer vibe than Federal a few miles down the road.  They get points for having professional, yet relaxed, servers, and no loud music.  There isn't a scene here: just a variety of people out to have a nice meal.  It's not a glorified hipster bar like Federal.  Right after being seated, I perused the menu, and found several promising pies.  The only thing I really liked about Federal was their pizza ideas: The Parlor is even better.  In addition to pies, The Parlor has sandwiches, salads, and some tasty looking appetizers and antipasti.  I had the lemonade (allegedly from a farm in Mesa), the caponata bruschetta, and a 8\" Puttanesca pie.  The bruschetta sounded like an excellent idea: eggplant caponata, currants, roasted peppers, pine nuts, and ricotta on toast.  The flavor was a little more bold than I was expecting, but it was good.  I think I would've cut back on the currants.  Of course, the pizza is the centerpiece of the restaurant (it is a pizzeria, after all).  I am sad to report that the Parlor does not make the best pizza in town.  The crust is average at best.  It wasn't bad enough to be a distraction, but it didn't have the best flavor or texture.  The ingredients (I'm looking at you, cheese!) didn't seem to be the highest quality.  My pizza was much greasier than a pie with nothing but calamari, shrimp, capers, spicy tomato sauce, olives, and fennel should be.  The cheese is clearly the culprit.  That said, the toppings were delicious.  Calamari on a pizza is something that needs to be done more.  It could've used more capers and olives (were there even any olives??).  The flavor profile was very good, even if the ingredients were subpar.  My friend went with the Mare.  I tried a slice; this was actually a very good pie.  Possibly one of the best pies I've had, as far as toppings go.  When it comes down to it, The Parlor is a solid restaurant, with a very solid menu and a nice ambiance, that could benefit from a little more attention to detail.  It strikes me as the type of place where the chef's heart is in the right place, but he is probably dealing with investor owners who don't want to shell out for the best ingredients.  It's hard to say, but at any rate, it's a place I'd go back to.  You could do worse at some of the Valley's more popular pizzerias.",

    "text": "4/18/12  Very, very good late lunch/early dinner meal for me, and it all started with a classic mojito.  Not the Garden mojito on the specialty cocktails menu that has cucumber in it (allergy).  Just a mojito made from a well rum, in this case Bacardi.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=9-cZ-SOtiX2ihwdrCs2FrQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/k1Qp...</a>  $6 during happy hour.  And it's a good one!  Fresh, muddled mint, a bit of lime juice, a spritz of ginger ale, sugar, and rum.  Initially I thought it a bit too sweet (from the ginger ale, instead of carbonated soda) but perhaps the alcohol content had something to do with my change of mind... :)  I was considering a bruschetta plate with two cheeses, but decided against it when I had a look at the dessert menu.  Nope, I'm just going to have a small plate of Pesto chitarra ($10) and perhaps the cherry zeppole later.  I have to tell you, I've been dreaming about this pasta dish for years, since the first time I saw another Yelper post a picture of it somewhere.  Years!!  And today's dish did not disappoint.  No, not at all.  You'd think after a few years' buildup on how spectacular this plate looks, I might not enjoy it so much, but I was happy with it.  Yep, I'm just going to come out and say it-- I ate the whole thing!  Every \"guitar\" string, all the grape tomato halves (which, honestly, wasn't hard to do, since there were only two whole pieces to speak of), each and every grated parmesan-coated pine nut, and all of the pesto sauce. I may have left some charred bits of the toasted focaccia bread on the plate, but what wasn't charred I used to sop up all of that pesto-infused EVOO.  The entire entree was off the hook!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=wYz23WxyjrTKUXsSUwnKSw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/k1Qp...</a>    Now, this is where any practical and health-conscious person would say, \"Ok, I've had enough.  I can't eat another bite.\"  But, I can't be practical.  Not when I'm half-way through my mojito!  So, I went ahead and ordered the zeppole ($6.50), and it took more than a few minutes to arrive, but I wasn't in a hurry.  When the six little Italian puffs of sugar-coated fresh-fried dough arrived, accompanied by two small pots of almond crema and Maker's Mark bourbon mascarpone, I knew I was in for a treat!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=0-sLOjmoMEBkWAcTZyHskQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/k1Qp...</a>  Even before I took a bite, I could detect the scent of cherries that were inside the fried moulds of dough, some of which you could see peeking through the sparkling sugar crystals.  And yes, I ate all six of them, and all of the almond crema.  There was no doubt that the mascarpone contained bourbon- it's pretty strong, and I didn't mind it, not at all, especially when you combine it with the almond, but had I known just how much i'd enjoy the almond crema, I'd have them give me two pots of it, instead of the mascarpone.  Now I know.  4.25 stars.    Can't wait to go back!",

Pizza try #2 then was missing 1/2 of the ingredients I actually DID put on the list. And so I waited again. Yet they charged me full price???  I apologized afterwards to the poor bartender that came in in the middle of this. He had no idea what was happening, and for that I'm sorry. But for blasting the kitchen that can't seem to read a simple list, I'm not sorry.",

My wife and I ordered the happy hour 8 inch pizza for $7. They also had $3 dollar draft beers. Really $10 for a pizza and a beer? Just way to good! The Autunnale pizza was delicious, sweet potato ricotta? Perfect!   The only downside was that our server was a little cold at first, maybe a little stand offish. He did warm up a little towards the end. But if it was possible to knock off a half star, I probably would.   This place has great food, and even better happy hour pricing. I just hope the next time I visit the waiter might smile a bit more.",

SO GOOD! The last one was the Spicy BBQ Chicken pizza, which was eh. I'm already not a fan of chicken on my pizza nor BBQ sauce at all, but I gave it a chance. My husband also placed this one last, so I couldn't be all wrong :-) I would totally come back here again.  They have a garden out front where they grow their own herbs and vegetables, which I admire in a restaurant. So kudos to them for adopting sustainability practices!",

They really have delicious fare and I've had many positive experiences there.  It's the perfect spot for girls night or a date night.    The service is generally friendly, prompt and unimposing (which is nice for girls nights and dates - plenty of opportunity to chat but you get what you need when you need it).    However, I've been here with large parties on several occasions, and the service was sub par.  The waiters tend to be totally inattentive (I've never seen that in a smaller party), they don't take reservations (you end up waiting for ages to get seated) and they won't split checks on a party of 6 or more.  All of this results in a really long experience with a lot of waiting, a lot of manual check-splitting and some irritation.   CONCLUSION: Amazing food, great for small parties, take your large party anywhere else.  PS The dessert is lovely! Try the banana cream pie trifle!! Real whipped cream on top, graham cracker on the bottom with a touch of salt, and the lightest, fluffiest banana cream pie in between!!",

So for lunch my friend suggested we try The Parlor. I love, love, love pizza so how could I resist?   I actually missed it when I was driving around. I practically live in this part of town and I have never seen this place. Who am I? Okay its east of Armadillo Grille and West of the drive for an apartment complex. Good luck.   Walk in and the feel is amazing! This place used to be a salon and there are photos of the shop along the walls and a 50's dryer in the ladies room! Not to mention you pass the herb garden as you walk in. Patio looks quaint and romantic. Though it was far to hot to sit outside I would in cooler months for sure. The inside is spacious and the tables are set pretty far apart. I appreciate that. High ceilings and subtle lighting. Very classy.   Morgan was our server and she was fast and friendly and talkative. She also helped us with our meal and desert selections. My friend and I split the pesto pizza and the duck club with fries! Then for desert we had the Zepole with the house-made butterscotch and the chile mascarpone... This was probably my favorite part of the meal and I LOVE the way Morgan described it to us before ordering! She said it's like a really amazing cornbread and a donut hole had a baby! She was right on the money! So good.  If you love local CenPho restaurants this place is a must try!  Xo Reese",

The dipping sauce isn't your typically spicy mayo, but a chipotle type of sauce. It was still very good and has a little kick to it.   For our entrees we ordered a 12 inch pepperoni pizza and cavatelli porchetta. The pizza was very delicious and I loved how they use the legit looking pepperoni. Not the ones that you normally see on pizzas but the huge ones! Lol the pizza itself was alittle oily because of the cheese and mostly from the pepperonis. It made the middle part of the pizza soggy because of how thin they made the dough, but it was still good. The porchetta was so good! The portion size is super small for the price that your paying. It had roasted pork which was so juicy and tender. It had the right amount of fat on it and the pasta that was on it was delicious as well.   We checked in and each got one free dessert! I ordered the sweet potato cheesecake and my friend ordered the tiramisu. Omg it was so yummy!!! The sweet potato cheesecake tasted like a pumpkin pie and it was so light! I love the pistachio that they put on it! The tiramisu was so good and light too! It had the right amount of cocoa on top and not overpowered by the coffee taste.   Overall this place was so good!! No wonder it was voted Number one on foodnetwork!",

We literally waited 15 minutes for a valet to pick up our car that was no more then 15 yards from where my dollar soaked hand was waiting.  To top it off the dude broke my window.  Please, Parlor, get your parking situation fixed.  You are a good dining option but not worth the hassle created by the gridlock outside.",

Try the funghi if you like mushrooms - the mix of cheese, truffle oil, and mushrooms is to die for. And don't miss the garden mojito, my favorite take on a classic cocktail. This place is good for lunch or dinner, with high top bar seating, a small but charming patio that successfully shields guests from busy Camelback Road, and a sizable dining room. Service is always good although sometimes a bit slow, but with a delicious pie and a strong cocktail, you won't mind even if it is.",

I don't quiet know what it is about the pizza but I just can get frenzied about the goodness of it. perchance the pizza was just not as fresh or crust as crisp or maybe it was something else (vagueness, forgive me..) but it really was not the best pizza ever, or even a great pizza, it just was.   The service was ok. Not fan-boy good, nor brilliant and pretty much like the pizza - average. It could have been so much better. Our waitress seemed bored, distant and would rather be elsewhere. The best part of the service was the lady that seated us who seemed joyous and happy. I like happy people, it makes my inner Pisces happy.   Having said that I will go back, maybe its the proximity, maybe I want to give it another chance for I think it possibly can be better.",

Had the Frito Misto, cooked well and the calamari was tender, the shrimp was small but good, the sauce was ok. The 8\" pizzas are $7 during happy hour so we tried a pepperoni  with mozzarella  snd basil.  It tasted good but it was insanely greasy,  pools of it, most I have ever seen on a pizza, not good! Cloth napkin so I couldn't  soak it up. Yelp check-in gives you 1/2 off coupon for a dessert, so we tried the chocolate cake. It was a basic chocolate bundt cake with whipped cream. It was to have Amerena (amaretto) cherries, to share we asked for it on the side, this is one of my favorite  things, it was a tsp of sauce and 2, count them...2 cherries in a little ramekin, woohoo! Our server was pleasant  and efficient  but we almost did not stay because of the overwhelming  smell of a cologne that I strongly  dislike! !! I later determined  it was the host with the light colored hair  in the short ponytail, toning it down in a place people are eating is wise, we want to smell the food, not cologne! I wanted to sit on a patio in the good weather, but this one overlooks the street and parking lot,  right along the driveway, so while it is outside, it is inside a floor to ceiling  concrete wall with little opening and a canopy above. The bar has old beautician  chairs to sit in and the ladies room has a very old beauty parlor hair dryer chair in the corner. All in all, there are so many choices in Phoenix  that I do not anticipate  a return visit!",

We made it in time for happy hour and ordered two 8\" pizzas, the summer corn and the salsiccia, and split them between the two of us. Delicious! Great crust, thin and crisp but chewy. I really enjoyed the summer corn pizza, the spicy crema and the cilantro really made it stand out for me. My husband also had their basil gimlet and I sneaked a sip - very well balanced, not too bitter or too sweet, just right. And, for it being July in Phoenix, sitting outside on their shaded patio with misters was pretty comfortable! The staff was great, well educated on their menu and our food came out quickly. Happy to add it to my list of favorite pizzas in the valley!",

Several weeks ago, on a date, I had one of the best seafood dishes I've ever eaten.  Wild caught Sturgeon on a bed of cippolini onions, purple fingerling potatoes, fava beans and a watercress puree with some greens on the top.  My date, who doesn't like fish, ended up eating half of the dish!  Truly great.  The other standout was the Spring Farro Risotto.  I never thought that risotto could come across as light, but this dish does.  Farro rice, preserved citrus, asparagus and spring peas all come together beautifully.  I had to force myself to stop eating in order to ensure I had leftovers for later.  It's pretty obvious that I'm a Parlor fanboy.  I don't feel bad about it though, they had to work pretty darn hard to make me this way.  Keep up the amazing work!",

The patio is cozy and inviting during the winter or summer with a fireplace and a vine covered wall and roof. I have been here many time but this last time was with some out of town friends. We started with the crispy calamari and the Arancini and both were perfectly done and not too much for three. For dinner we ordered the house pizza, the margarita pizza and the Fettuccine Amatriciana. This last pasta dish was amazing and something I had never had before. I highly recommend trying this flavorful dish.  For dessert ,we kind of went over board , and had the olive oil cake- good but basic, the banana trifle- very good and rich, and the cherry tart- by far the best of the three.  My favorite sitting area is the bar area which is flanked by windows that flood the room with light.  On the outside of the bar windows is an herb garden followed by the walkway to come in. Even though you would think you might feel like your in a fish bowl sitting by the window you never do but it doesnt matter where you sit as the whole place is inviting and comfortable. This restaurant is lovely to take friends, family, or a date.",

The pasta was to die for and the veggies were so fresh and juicy!  I cannot recommend the cellos enough. They make lemoncello, orangecello, and blood orangecello. All are excellent and VERY strong.

And the food rivals other upscale/gourmet pizzerias like Humble Pie and Cibo. The large field greens salad at first seemed a little pricey for the size, but was totally worth it for the quality and amazing flavor. I'd be back for that even if the pizza sucked, which is surely does not. The smokey pizza was very unique and wonderful - the olive tapenade really added such a nice touch - and I LOVE their crust, thin throughout the middle, crisp but chewy on the edges. I can't wait to go back to work my way through their menu!",

My pizza was definitely delicious...I built my own pecorino, prosciutto, fresh tomato and arugula pie and practically inhaled it upon arrival.  There's no question the place is going through its \"hot\" phase right now. It will likely last a while which is good or bad depending on what you're looking for.  It's a trendy urban scene with lots of good looking types, .  To avoid what would have been a long wait, we vultured a table in the bar which was full of big groups of friends (yes, it is LOUD but thats what you'll get with concrete block and wood walls).  I'll definitely go back for the pizza, but may wait a while for the hotness factor to wear off a bit. For me, the energy levels need to come down a notch to a slightly less intense frequency.  Although it is a good spot for friends on a fun night out, I would recommend lunch or a mid-week visit as a good option for anyone wanting to check out the food rather than the weekend scene.",

I was impressed that the building was able to accomodate so many tables and there was no wait even though the parking lot was full and it was prime dinner time. The vegetable garden was deffinitely a nice touch to the entrance way. We ordered a couple happy hour beers and agree that the selection is great. The pizzas we ordered came out piping hot and in a modest time, but thank goodness we told the waitress beforehand to have them baked on the raw side. The pizzas at the next table came out befote ours and had black charred crust and cheese which would have totally ruined it for me. I had seen that warning in another review so thank you!!! The BBQ chicken pizza was spicy and flavorful while the pesto pizza was rich with cheese and basil. Very yummy. I felt like the restaraunt was well put together, but didn't  impress me with anything original. I'll probably be back if invited for a party escpecially when you can sit outside.",

Either way, we arrived and went in - looked around a bit and decided to sit at the bar - good call.  Bartender came right over and got our drink order and gave us menus.  We asked for recommendations, and he told us what he liked and when we had questions, he was more than accomodating about each menu item we asked about.  I saw Pabst Blue Ribbon on tap and had to have one - this is the very first beer I ever had when I was a \"kid\" back in Indiana.  The beer was cold and delicious - very pleasant surprise.  We both ordered pizza - I ordered the barbecue chicken and my wife ordered the margherita with pepperoni and mozz ... they were both delectable!  I ate all of mine, and finished hers - not normal ... but oh so good!  The atmosphese is very cool - the place used to be an old Beauty Parlor - now it's a new Pizza Parlor - The Parlor - go figure!  We'll be going back - I work close to here, so I may be going back more even during the work lunch.  Check it out - you won't be disappointed.",

Luckily, they have happy hour every day (weekends included yay!!) from 3pm-6pm so I have plenty of chances to get down there.  During HH, they do a bunch of $5 appetizer specials, as well as $8 pizzas.  This is a smoking deal, and the food is on point.  My favorite appetizer is hands down the Cauliflower Gratinata.  It's a bowl full of piping hot cauliflower that has been simmering in a cheese sauce that is lick the bowl good.  Absolutely amazing.  Also, you cannot go wrong with any of the pizzas.  I think the Spicy BBQ Chicken pizza is one of the best in the Valley, so definitely check that one out.  Double bonus for the staff being friendly and helpful, and also that they use a lot of their ingredients from their onsite garden.  Nice to have a local place using fresh ingredients that they take care of.  You can taste that love in the food :)  A+++ in my books!",

    "text": "My hopes were fairly high going into this. Many positive 4-5 star reviews, and they touted the #1 Pizza in Arizona. So suffice to say, I went in with expectations very high. However, I was moderately disappointed by both the quality and overall taste of the pizza.  First things first, everything non-food related:  Service was efficient and kind. Atmosphere was good, I wanted to sit outside but it was fairly crowded, it has a great outdoor dining area but c'est la vie.  Wait Times were decent. For this outing, we just ordered a pizza and it took standard times for wood-baked pizza. It was piping hot when it arrived. Pricing: Expensive for what you are getting. This cost a star. I will talk further about this with the actual food section.  Food: For this outing, we got the  12\"  \"spicy\" barbeque chicken pizza.   Positives: The Crust, The Bake and Cheese - Definitely one of, if not the best, Crust + bake on a pizza. This was a major positive. The crust was light and not 'bready' at all. The only downside (and an extremely minor one) is that the dough was so light, that the toppings were juuuust on the border of unwieldy on top of it. But easily the pizza's best quality.  The MEH: the chicken. Nothing Special. Grilled (I think?), and mainly serving as an afterthought in my opinion. Had no real memorable flavoring in it. Would have better been served with SOME sort of spices, something to better flavor/spice up the dish. Which is where we hit my major negative.  The Negative: False Advertising. This pizza is touted as a \"Spicy\" Barbeque Chicken pizza. The sauce, while a very good mild and almost sweet barbeque, borders on bland. No spices whatsover. Would have done 100% better with a more Louisiana style sauce or maybe even a fruity habenero if you still wanted the sweetness in it. You could TASTE the sugar in this sauce more than anything else and it really retracted from the overall taste of the pizza. So what contributed to the actual \"spicy-ness\" of the dish? It certainly wasn't the sauce or the chicken. They made the decision to put these tiny, and when i mean tiny, i mean smaller than a dime size, serrano peppers scattered throughout the pizza. There was ONE maybe TWO per slice and it contributed to a completely scattered and inconsistent dish. It ended up being 4-5 bites savory-sweet, and one bite kind-of spicy - If you've ever had Serrano peppers, I would put them on the Mild side of spicyness. I basically slammed on some red-chile peppers on every slice just to get that spicyness I truly wanted.   I think that incorporating some more spice into the sauce itself would serve as an extremely easy fix or maybe by marinating the chicken pre-cook in some spices - either that, or just call this pizza a \"Barbeque Chicken Pizza\" and leave out the \"Spicy\".  I know am being overly-critical, as the pizza itself was actually pretty good - albeit a majorly flawed and misconceived menu item.  However, When you are charging nearly 20$ for a 12\" Pizza, I expect that pizza to be ON POINT. If you are going to tout yourselves as the #1 Pizza Place in Arizona, and then charge as such, I expect to get what I am ordering, and not a watered down, scattered concept.  They have all the right things going on, but the execution was deeply flawed. I will go here again to try something else, and hopefully I can update this with a better experience.",

I ordered the bruschetta and waited about 30-45 min. I finally asked the bartender why it was taking  so long and she gave me an attitude and told me she ordered it awhile ago so not sure. I was thinking it was just an off night until Friday this week. I took 2 clients to lunch there at 1130 am and it was not very busy yet. We waited over 30 min for 2 small make your own pizzas and a garden veggie plate. The manager came over and said \"I am going to remake the pizzas since they sat in the window so long and will discount your tab\". So the kitchen made it in a timely manner but waiter failed to deliver it. New pizzas came out and the waiter didn't think anything of it. We ended up having to take them to go since it took so long. The manager did discount the tab which was nice but we would have rather had lunch. My clients  told me they get to pick next time since they were so unimpressed. It was pretty embarrassing to say the least. Not sure what's going on there but I am not willing to give it another try.",

    "text": "LOVE The Parlor!! I don't know how else to put it.. this place is AH- Mazing. I've been coming to the parlor every now and then for a few years now(mostly for happy hour). Today I visited for lunch and was surprised at the amount of people there(but not really because it's BOMB). Since I was with a few co workers we ordered a large-ish chefs board with a variety of cheeses(burrata is my fave) and meats.. olives and nuts.. of course i have to mention the fantastic pesto, jam and pepper mix. Everything was just SO good. After the board we all ordered our own personal pizza. As you can imagine none of us finished our pies lol but we were more than fine with having as leftovers. Overall, the ambiance is nice, upscale, semi hipster-chic with a touch of pizzeria brewery feel if that makes sense. I'm sure anything  you order will be great although I choose to stick with the boards and pizzas because they're just so delicious. They have a different selection of beer so if you're stuck on Miller lite, you might want to pre plan your drink so you're not let down. Anyway.. I can go on for days but just go and enjoy for yourself! You won't be sorry :)",

If you could see me in person you'd know I am an utter and complete foodie--I KNOW good food and The Parlor is off the charts!   The interior design is somewhat modernist but warm and inviting. The atmosphere lends itself to be a great place for friends and family to congregate and enjoy a great meal together.  We sat at the Pizza counter in incredibly comfortable stools that beckon you to kick back and enjoy the views! The chefs work with creative precision as pizza after pizza goes in and comes out of the wood-fired oven with ease. It's apparent that these guys really enjoy what they do--each pizza is made with loooove as they top them with various nuts, herbs, cheeses and oils before sending them out to the restaurant floor to be devoured.   With all there is on the menu to choose from; we stuck to a few salads (Heirloom Tomato & Artichoke Summer Squash--Both delightfully delicious! :-) and shared a mouth-watering Aged Cheddar burger that was epic! I am nuts over a burger that's juicy-drippy-cheesy goodness and this by far delivers! I tossed the bun aside and had it with just the fresh baby greens salad--it was to die for!   Then we were on to dessert--when one of the Chef's was out and about--stopped in to say hello and give us the rundown of what we could choose from. We went with the Chocolate Cake--and here's when you know you've got something good--time stood still as I moaned as I swallowed every bite of that incredibly moist, not-to-sweet scrumptious delight as it hit my tongue. I have died and gone to heaven--there is no cake (and I KNOW cake!) in this town that is as good (well at least that I've found) as this Chocolate Cake from The Parlor. If you haven't had it yet--let me tell you--they use only the best ingredients; their own house-made sour cream and Italian imported cherries--dark delicious cocoa powder--and even a little balsamic vinegar to enhance the flavor and assist in maintaining moisture! This cake melts in your mouth--better than butter! You get the picture!   To top it all off, one of the proprietor's (son--didn't catch his name--many apologies) had noticed that we were tuned into watching the kitchen action as if we were watching Iron Chef. He came over and intro'd himself and chatted with us about his vision and why he wanted to build a great restaurant. Niice. He's doing something right and you can see that just by looking around at the happy smiling faces that fill each and every table!   I could go on and on... but should stop for now.  If you couldn't tell--this is my new favorite place. Stop in and let me know if your visit is just as great as ours--I can't wait to hear about it!   Ciao! :-)",

Not bad at $3 a selection. We chose one of each and it was soooo good. The meat and cheese came with some flat bread slices and 2 sauces: A pesto and what I think is a sweet chili and red pepper concoction (That was my favorite of the two). The best part about this place was the garden. They have a decent sized raised bed when you walk up to the front and they use as many of these ingredients as they can on and in their food. Also the parking lot was surrounded by tomatoes or something (hard to see in the dark) growing on the railings. Pretty cool spot, you have to try it at least once.",

    "text": "My friends like The Parlor more than I do.   That's not to say it's sub-par, but rather they gush about it so profusely that there's no way it can live up to the hype. (Note: I talk about expectations a lot because it's half the dining experience.)  I've had the pizza and the duck club. Both are very good. The setting is nice and the location is about perfect. I like the patio and bar area more than the main dining room.  My reasons for a 3 instead of a 4 or higher? The prices strike me as about 15 percent higher than they should be. And the staff has never blown me away. My last waiter was extremely goofy and unapologetically slow, especially since it wasn't even a capacity crowd.  The Parlor is one of those places that I'll continue to visit every now and again because a) The experience will probably never be awful; and b) my friends and family often call the shots.  Hence, a solid 3-star rating.",

    "text": "So Sweet Pea and I finally got to The Parlor after hearing from everyone how great it is. We were immediately charmed by the atmosphere. It was crowded and buzzy, with a vintage modern yet warm feel. We parked it at the bar to wait the 45 minutes for our table. I tried a St. James, which I thought was delicious: citron vodka, elderflower (whatever that is) and prosecco with a twist served in a martini glass. It was tart and cold and wonderful, just what I was in the mood for. Sweet Pea wasn't thrilled with his mojito. Being a mojito connoisseur, he felt like this was just eh.  He enjoyed his next drink, the peppered pear, with pear vodka and black pepper, much better.  Time went quickly, and soon we were seated outside on a crowded yet quaint patio with lots of heaters and a fireplace.  It was warm enough for even me, who is cold when it gets below 80 degrees.  As we sat down and looked over the delicious-sounding menu, I remarked that if the food was as good as the atmosphere, this may become my new favorite place.  Sweet Pea agreed.  Unfortunatlely, it was not to be.  I started off with the butternut squash appetizer, which was just OK.  Sweet Pea seemed to enjoy his meat and cheese plate more, although we both agreed that whatever that was that they were calling gorgonzola was the blandest cheese we've ever had.  And I'm not a fan of the blue.  The pesto that came with it was very delicious.  On to the pizzas- I had the funghi which was lots of mushrooms with goat cheese, and he had the sausage.  And...it was not that great.  We finished off with the chocolate cake, which I'd seen yelped as amazing, and it was not anything special.  Worse that that, it wasn't even really tasty, and it was dry.  We'll go back and try the pasta; maybe it will become our new go-to pasta place now that Pastabar has closed.  But we're sticking with Cibo for the pizza.",

There are lots of places for good pizza but not many are quite as good as The Parlor.  Every pizza I've had is great; choose one the suits your topping preferences.  The Cubano is one of the best sandwiches of all time and the Roasted Banana Ice Cream will change what you think about frozen treats.  No matter what you get, you'll be getting meal made of responsibly sourced, local ingredients prepared simply with a lot of integrity.  Keep in up Parlor!",

The antipasti menu has a great mix and is also reasonably priced. Good wine and beer selection as well. Specialy mixed drinks are all creative but nothing I was sold on that I wanted to order again and again. Great experience every time. No complaints.",

Now, I am not one who normally goes for pizza.  Most days of the week I'd much rather have sushi, a gyro, or jimmy john's (I'm all over the place).  After having the pesto pizza, I could have pizza twice a week, maybe more.  Salads are equally fantastic.  The parlor insalata is one of the best salads I've ever had.  I want to try others, but it's just too damn good.  Great restaurant for a date or with a group of friends.  I'm moving closer to The Parlor in a few months.....I may be showing up a few days a week now:)",

My boyfriend and I went here because a couple of bartenders at other restaurants had recommended their cocktails. We went on a super busy Saturday night, but were able to weasel our way to the bar. We each had a unique, classic cocktail with a spin and tried a sip of some Hirsch bourbon. Absolutely worth it! The place itself is set up for mingling and interacting with other patrons. It was nice striking up a conversation about good beer and bourbon with the two guys next to us. The atmosphere is very trendy and hipster, but that's always nice- dark and romantic at least. I cannot wait to go back and try the amazing-looking pizzas!",

Wonderful ambiance, reasonable prices and great service. The inside was candle-lit and lively, yet intimate at the same time. The outside is a lovely patio with plants and misters. Wildflowers and a beautiful wine display were the perfect extra touches.   I ate their famous duck club and yes, it really is that awesome! My husband had pizza, which he gave a rave review. We split the tiramisu and it was heavenly!  Will definitely be visiting again in the near future!  Edit: 4 years later, this place is still my absolute favorite!

The DUCK CLUB!  Nom nom nom!

    "text": "Everyone has their favorite pizza place, this is my very close runner up.  Toppings so fresh some are grown on site; this beauty parlor turned pizza salon is the best \"fancy pizza\" encountered to date.  Distinctive delicious specialty pizzas such as the Puttanesca along with formidable performances on classics like \"just pepperoni and sausage\".  Their wine, beer and cocktail selection endorse the chic mood, then authenticate upon delivery to the palate; a mojito crisp enough for the aroma to reach us before it did our lips, an in-season draught, and a chardonnay buttery enough to slip past a rough day.  Classy casual ambiance with \"still able to have conversation\" audio level,  well worth 20% tip service make the Parlor good for a date with someone special, happy hour, and/or visiting with out-of-towners.  Venturing away from pizza will have auspicious results; so it's also promising for local regulars and high quality take-out.  The 8\" or 12\" pies will leave some wanting more, while allowing others to indulge and still watch their figure.  Parking can also get lean, so have some cash ready to take advantage of the valet that's available during busier times.  Very cosmopolitan, we can still see their pizza parlor roots offering the regular menu combination of a 12\" pizza and pitcher of beer for $25.",

We are huge fans of LGO and are happy to have another place like it closer to central Phoenix. For an appetizer we had the Frito Misto (calamari and rock shrimp). I wasn't a fan of the shrimp but really liked the calamari. I would have like the app to be less greasy but then again, maybe I shouldn't have ordered a fried appetizer. The 3 of is split two of the small $10 pizzas (Pepperoni and Smokey- sans the olive tepanade because I hate olives). Each of the pizzas had 6 slices and truly was plenty for the 3 of us. We felt rather gluttonous after eating all of the pizza. The pizzas were sooooo good! As I mentioned, we went during lunch but managed to get there before the rush.

    "text": "So far I've only been to the Parlor once, and I had a fabulously delicious salad... but I'll be back.  I am always thrilled when a business takes an architecturally interesting building and updates it while preserving all that's good with the original structure.   In fact I feel so strongly about this that I absolutely boycott businesses that tear down wonderful structures and build their own all-new places on the gravesite of what once was.  This is a place that looks like, from the street, there might be very little parking - but don't be fooled!  There is a huge lot in the back.   The Parlor was an old beauty parlor.... not someplace you'd think about eating italian food, but the building update they undertook is just awesome and wonderful in every way.  They preserved and integrated exposed old wood beams, and even the beauty parlor chairs - faithfully and painstakingly cleaned and preserved -  are now bar stools.   There are just too many details I want to look at again.   I noticed that there is a stunning fireplace outside, this will be a must-stop once the weather turns chilly again.   (Please: someday it will be chilly again, right?)  I'm mostly talking in this review about ambiance because that is what struck me most strongly, along with the deliciously fresh salad I had for lunch that day.   As an aside, I was there really really late for lunch - like 2:30 pm - and the cook didn't notice my order had been placed by the waitress -so after about 15 or 20 minutes, I asked if she could check on my salad.... then I got it right away.  This was no big deal, I had been reading the paper and it wasn't an obnoxiously long delay.... well, they absolutely REFUSED to let me pay for my lunch.   The cook profusely apologized.  The waitress profusely apologized.  The manager profusely apologized.   Very, very classy place.   So despite the glitch, I think they still deserve 5 stars for going above and beyond to make sure I was happy.  I'll be back!",

We then followed that up by splitting a 12\" margherita pizza, a small parlor insalata (without salami) and a small farm greens salad (minus the chicken). The pizza had a good mouth-feel and was somewhat more airy than AJ's pizza. My dining partners only gripe was that the wine menu could have used descriptions of the wine. Overall was really impressed with the Parlor and can imagine that it would be in my regular rotation, especially for happy hour!",

    "text": "This past Friday night found me wanting a way to unwind after a crappy day.  A friend suggested pizza, but neither of us were in the mood for the usual.  He searched Yelp and came up with The Parlor and its great reviews.  we decided to give it a shot.  We showed up around 6:30 to a packed parking lot.  There was a long wait for a table inside, but we opted to eat on the patio and were immediately seated (after, of course, a Scottsdale mom and and old dude each cut in front of us).  Our waitress was Lisa.  She brought us water and made drink recommendations.  The drink special of the night was some sort of watermelon/vodka/lime juice concoction, which she highly recommended.  I took her up on that while my friend ordered a Blue Moon Hefe (on tap).  My drink was AWESOME!  I expected some sort of syrupy-sweet watermelon-flavored drink, but what I got was real, pureed watermelon!  Really good, really refreshing... and really refreshing at $9!  It was worth it.  After mulling over the menu, we decided to split the spicy BBQ chicken pizza, sans green onions.  We waited a short while before our pizza was brought out.  To my dismay, I noticed green onions all over the pizza.  We flagged down our waitress and asked for a new one.  True to her word, just five minutes later we had a fresh pie.  This pizza was, perhaps, one of the BEST I've ever had.  The crust wasn't too thin or too thick, the BBQ sauce was wonderfully flavorful and just enough, and the serrano chiles were really hot.  The 12\" was a perfect size for the two of us to split.  We weren't overstuffed but weren't left hungry, either.  For dessert, we ordered a seasonal fruit crostata, which that day was nectarine.  It was served with a small scoop of vanilla gelato.  this was a fantastic end to a perfect meal.  The fruit was sweet and tart, the crust was flaky and sweet, and the gelato tied it all together.  Altogether, our bill came out to $49 and change, which I felt was a great value for a meal that included three drinks apiece, pizza, and dessert.  Oh, and the pizza?  We're both still talking about and craving it.  I'm looking forward to my next visit!",

I tend to visit the most during happy hour and they always have a fun crowd with a great bar setup.  Parking can be a pain sometimes but that is what I tend to expect out of good restaurants these days and you can always valet if needed.  I have really tried the other menu items outside of the pizza and their salads.  That is what I go there for and it is too damn good not to have it every time!",

It seems that the menu options have decreased and unfortunately the quality of the food has followed.  However, The Parlor is still in our \"go to\" list because of the reasonable prices, valet parking (parking lot is tiny), convenient location and relaxed atmosphere (I can wear shorts, t-shirt and sandals and feel in place).  The service was as good as it could have been given the customer to server ratio.  The servers are definitely in over their heads when the restaurant is full.  We had to be patient and had trouble finding our server.  The patio was nice with the fans and misting system.  I did leave a bit wet, but it was hot out and felt nice.",

Both to left us with empty plates and the temptation to lick the rest of the sauce off the bowl with our tongues!    I also had the garden mojito, which is probably one of the best mojitos I have ever had.  Not sweet at all, but very refreshing with fresh basil.  We waited for a while before anyone came to take our drink orders.  Not too long of a wait, longer than usual, but nothing we were complaining about.  At the end of our meal the server brought us a gift certificate for waiting so long.  I thought this was a great gesture, something I did not see a need for at all.  We will definitely be back for more!",

    "text": "I always thought of myself as a calm, laid back gal... But, it turns out that the waitstaff at a certain restaurant can get me **really** riled up.  Some highlights:  Picture a waiter walking up to your table and instead of saying \"welcome... what would you like...\" just walking up and saying, well,  nothing!  Yes, nothing.  Just staring. Eventually, you get said waiter to talk. Turns out its probably better when he doesn't talk.  Completely unhelpful in helping us understand how many pizzas to get for the group.  Fast forward... pizzas arrive ... only not quite what we ordered.  We say \"its no big deal\" but clearly in an \"I'm being polite\" sort of way.  There is a clear reaction that any decent waitstaff would have---\"sorry!  we'll fix this.\"  Instead just utter rudeness throughout the rest of the meal.    The pizzas themselves were fine.  Probably 3.5-4 fine.  But, the waitstaff....   One word of caution: Its rather hard to find.  You might not find it and circle the block two or three times.  Or, you might find it at the last second and want to make a sharp right turn.  Please be nice to the cars behind you!",

He brought me delicious french fries with light parmesan cheese and parsley and were to die for. The sandwich was similarly deiish. Duck breast with a sweet, smoky tomato sauce and some applewood smoked bacon that were sandwiched between a soft, challah type roll that was a perfect foil for what was in the middle; light and lucious and not too much bread.   It's in my work 'hood but not my neighborhood, even so, made an immediate report to the lovely: must go!!",

The risotto was well cooked but the flavor was lacking something.  It wasn't a bad dish, I have just had better. We ordered the Salsiccia for dinner and I thought it was great.  The flavors worked well together, although the sage at time took center stage.  I am a fan of sage and it didn't bother me, but not every bite was a perfect bite.  It would have been nice to balance the grilled radicchio with the sage but overall this pizza was great.  The kicker was the addition of Saba to the pizza, what a brilliant idea.  This pizza is a winner. Finally for dessert I ordered the sweet potato cheesecake.  This desert was amazing, they created a cheesecake with perfect ratios.  It is not an overpowering cheesecake or sweet potato, just perfect.  The crust on the bottom gave it a nice crunch.  This was a desert I would return for...or try to replicate myself.",

It has a self park lot that was so overflowing the cars were double parked so I presume the valet had spilled over. The line for valet was about 6 cars deep so we parked across the street in the lot for Best Buy. Now....the pizza. Excellent Margherita pizza. Probably the best I've had in Phoenix. Atmosphere is very cool and service was good considering how busy the place was (we went for happy hour). It's nice to have found a pizza place in Phoenix that rivals NYC and Chicago.",

    "text": "Been watching this place build up over the months as an admirer of the Armadillo Grill and found the opportunity to mosey over for my last minute Thursday night birthday dinner with my wife and friend.   The place has always looked packed and we decided to see what the hype was all about. Right away - when you walk towards the entrance, you get a sense of the fresh smells and coolness of the place. We were greeted and told that it would be a 20 minute wait. No worries - we went to the bar and ordered some drinks. No wait on the order, even though the the bar was packed. We just stood against the back wall  people watching and compared some of the people to the Vig for sure without the douchbags standing in the walk way to the bathroom! But there were grandmas, families, guys having a night out, couples, it was a good diverse crowd! The place seems to have a more relaxed, cool vibe. Seats at the bar opened up right away and we got seated minutes after that. I was wearing shorts, t-shirt and hat and did not feel under dressed at all after looking around and seeing guys in tank tops.   Our server was cool and did not rush us since we were in good conversation when we got seated. We took a while with the menu and when it was time to order - he was there. We ordered a $18 bottle of wine... Let me say this again.... $18 bottle of wine! Unheard of!  We had the Eggplant Bruschetta as a starter - Wow! It was good! I was expecting pieces of bread breaking apart in your bleeding mouth, with all the stuff falling on the plate destroyed. No Way - it was good! A mix of sweet and sour with a richness that is just good!  We chose to split 3 of the 8 inch pizzas($10 ea.) to get taste of everything. We ordered the Smokey, the Margherita and the Yukon Gold (?). The ingredients are so friggin fresh!!! Love Thin crust, wood fired oven pizza and this hit the spot! Usually I can eat a lot of pizza, but when you get something that tastes so good, you can have a few pieces and be set!   The server had overheard it was my bday, so we asked what he recommended. He said you have to have the Tiramisu. Good size and def enough to share. It was rich and full of flavor and did not disappoint. The server even brought it with a candle! Just that attention to small stuff like that makes a meal a better experience!   Good place! Like others have said - the interior was cool and modern without being too much for Pizza!  Keeping the block wall from the original building and making it the centerpiece of the room was done very well! Props to the design team for the interior. The open eating/kitchen environment makes it a great place to get a corner table and watch. I would recommend this place for sure. Even though some reviewers called it \"Vig 2.0\" - I do not think that is fair - because I would not recommend the Vig to everyone.  Since I am a fan of the Armadillo, I know that the parking is a snap if you know where to go and esp. know about the lot behind the Armadillo's lot. So now you have no reason to bitch about parking and not to eat here! Don't Park at Best Buy either  - Your gonna die or make the traffic in that area a mess! Glad to have this place in my hood for sure!",

    "text": "Well, here we go again: Phoenicians handing out five star reviews like penicillin at a downtown clinic. They just make it too easy if you ask me (but who's askin'?). Been here a few times now.  The place: Really like it. Lots of wood surroundings, comfortable, open, and an herb garden right outside the front door. Terrific.  Service: Had everything from sassy and sweet (previous visits) to \"nice\" but detached and probably didn't wanna work that day (my latest visit). But we've all been there. Really like that there's always a hostess and there are lots of people buzzing about so you are always taken care of pretty promptly.  Food: O.K. - so we get it already - the pizza is good. It's the same as LGO as Pizza Biancho as blah blah blah. Has anyone really not noticed that flat pizza is about the same everywhere in the city? Phoenicians are annoyingly obsessed with \"artisan\" pizza. If they put half the energy they spend chasing down the latest artisan pizza into getting the Roosevelt district on it's creative feet, this could almost be one hell of a town. Sadly...the pizza chase continues. YES - the pizza is good here. Had the margherita and the seafood. Yum, fresh, and very pleasing.  What I've noticed is that nobody has really reviewed anything other than the pizza and obvious adjoining fare. Well, here goes...  Went there the other day, ordered, and was greeted by what had to be the smallest calamari appetizer I have ever seen. No joke...it's literally, like 10 pieces of calamari and shrimp combined. While I'm certainly not going to need gastric-bypass anytime soon to avert my hogging, I DO likes my calamari. This app has a three minute enjoyment time TOPS. At $9 for this amuse-bouche (that's French for \"holy CRAP this is small\"), you can skip it. I'm talking so little it has to cuff it's underwear to keep from tripping on itself. And then....the salad. Had the miserable beet salad, which arrived in a sort of flood-overflow-berm-meets-landing-strip-shave-job-for-a-centerfold shape. Oh - and again we are talking small. I'm a big fan of beets and the salads they adorn, but why would I pay $9 (again!!) for this meal when I can get a bountiful, delicious beet salad with dark, dark greens and breadsticks at Deluxe? I wouldn't. And I won't again.  The BF and nephew had burgers - and they were very well seasoned, the buns had that twinge of crispy deliciousness, and the fries were well seasoned and tasty. Not a single complaint about these dishes.  ...but that salad. And that calamari. Whew....  This place is getting some things very right, but it sure isn't hitting all the marks. And their prices on some things definitely need a second going-over, because it's just a rip-off.  Oh, Artisan pizza...how you've made pseudo-critics out of a hungry, hungry populace. Sigh",

Gold was my favorite pizza I've had so far in my life, very thinly sliced potatoes, creamy ricotta, pancetta, and leeks, all combined for a great pie. The pepperoni was pretty straightforward, well-executed but nothing I'll remember next week. For desert, the tiramasu was delicious, but I must confess I am a tiramasu fiend. If not for my very sensitive teeth, I would've appreciated the caramel chips sprinkled throughout more, but my gf said it went well with it.  This place was great! The last aspect I loved was the feeling of comfort it induced, I wound up spending about an hour here despite the pizzas coming out very quickly, just a great place to relax and eat. I plan on coming here over and over!  8'' pizzas = $10, so obviously 2 = $20 Tiramasu = $6 Soft Drink = $2.50 each",

Being on the older, uncooler side of things, we tend to hit Parlor early in the night, since by 8pm there's a line out the door, and it's populated by the, ahem, \"Scottsdale\" crowd.

    "text": "Let me digress a little before I begin the review. The Parlor is serving up those pizzas that defy typical definitions. It's not quite New York and not quite Neapolitan, not quite thick or thin. It occupies the grey area, a blend of different styles which is becoming extremely popular. It's a cross-over of sorts, borrowing aspects of many different styles. There's the fresh mozzarella found on Neapolitan pizzas but the well-seasoned sauce you expect on a New York slice. Basically, we need a new definition of pizza. What is this? What exactly do we have here? If you made me pick, I'd say it's closest to California style, although that genre tends to be defined more by the ridiculous topping combinations than the essential elements of the pizza. If you have a name for it, please let me know.   As much as defining this pizza gave me trouble, the pizza here confused me almost an equal amount. Though there are things to like, I'm not entirely sure I like them. That probably doesn't make much sense, so let's just dive into it. The crust started off strong with a nice char-tinged rim that had a good balance of crispiness and chewiness, but the center was a little soggy and couldn't hold its weight. On a small 8 incher, I'm not asking too much for the crust to hold strong.  It had only a hint of complex flavor fermentation but paired it with a little salty kick. It was enough to do the job.   The sauce packed a punch of oregano, a kick of red pepper, and rounded it off with a little dash of sugar. It was a pretty good sauce with a balanced profile. I would have preferred a little less oregano and maybe some more garlic but I can definitely respect what they're doing here. They used fresh mozzarella which I think only really works well on a True Neapolitan pizza. Too often pizzerias end up gobbing up the pizza with hunks that just don't melt that well. The Parlor didn't go that far, but the choice of cheese didn't do much to help the overall pizza experience.  We ordered a pepperoni and a margherita, which is my go to when I see a place that uses a wood-fired oven. The pepperoni was definitely the better of the two, primarily because the pepperonis themselves were a cut far above the normal cured meat you see on pizza. They brought a little spiciness and savoriness which was honestly my favorite part of this pizza experience. Everything worked well in this combination.   The margherita was where The Parlor lost my confidence. I guess I misread the menu without realizing they serve the version of the margherita with no sauce and whole heirloom tomatoes. Yuck. This type pizza really needs to find its own name, because it has betrayed True pizza lovers far too many times. Personal preference aside, it really wasn't that good. The cheese was kind of gooey and soggy in a bad way, which isn't great news on a white pizza when the cheese is pretty much all you get. The crust was decent enough to save the experience but if I accidentally ordered this again, I probably wouldn't finish it. I will say I've had better experiences in the past when I've ordered a 12 inch pizza instead of an 8 inch. I don't know why it makes a difference but the 12 inch pizzas looked noticeably better. I'd guess there's a better toppings ratio on the larger pizzas.   So where does the Parlor stand? It was just okay. You can tell they have very good intentions. They use great ingredients and make a lot of things in house. The topping combinations are interesting and for this nameless style of pizza, the Parlor doesn't do a bad job. But ultimately good intentions don't automatically make for a good pizza. There are definitely areas of improvement which kept me from thoroughly enjoying the experience. I would eat here again, but I'm in no hurry to do so. And I'm a little sour about the margherita thing. Above average, but not by much.",

When I got there the food wasn't ready so I sat down and waited, which was no big deal. A few minutes after arriving I could see my food was ready. Then I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for my food. I even made awkward eye contact with one of the cooks who could see that was my food. I finally got tired of waiting so I walked up to the little blonde host who was too busy talking to the other host to notice my food was ready. When I told her my food was ready she said \" ok\" not apologetic or anything. She was totally not doing her job nor was she friendly or show any signs that she cares at all about her job. No customer service was provided while I was there. I could understand if they were super busy, but I was the only one waiting for take out. It's really disappointing to have a place with such great food be represented by people who could careless about their job. Oh and when I got home I realized they got my order wrong :/",

The atmosphere was so great that I didn't even notice how busy it was until I decided to look around. The servers were on point and very friendly. This was my first time sitting in the bar area. There are also great spots in the dining room and the patio has great ambiance.   We ordered everything.... There was a great deal that night. I don't know if it's a normal deal but $25 for a pie and a pitcher is a great value. We ordered a pitcher of Stella and a Smokey. The Smokey has smoked prosciutto, olives and ricotta. YUM. For an appetizer we went with the calamari and rock shrimp. We also had a plate of cheese (brie) and more prosciutto. For dessert the tiramisu and a french press of Lux coffee.  All of that between 3 people and our bill only came out to $66. Which surprised us (we thought it would be more). Everything always tastes amazing and the prices are reasonable. The Parlor is high on my list for places to try in Phoenix.",

Stick to the pizza, and, enjoy the 'to the point' service. There are times when I like places that don't pop the 'how do you like the food?' question every 15 minutes. Sit back, relax and make the most of the outdoorsy weather that is coming up.  Their compulsory valet is a mess, but, a mess worth their pizza.  P.S.

Yes, the Parlor is cute and the ambience and architecture are cool, but the food is nothing short of EXCELLENT every time.  Every single time, I hear myself saying, \"this is amazing.  The food is always soooo good here!!!\".  It really is!  Yes, they have a great happy hour, but honestly, their food is reasonably priced anyway (like their entree sized seafood salad for $10...where else can you get that?!?!?!?).  If you order off the \"meat and cheese\" menu, they bring the meat(s) and cheese(s) on a wooden tray with pesto and jammy/salsa sauce and a bunch of home made pita bread.  It's awesome.  I've had pizza, salad, pasta, lamb meatballs, and everything in between here, and everything is always just a pure pleasure to eat.  The portions are plentiful without being overwhelming, and are beautifully presented.  Their bartenders are so cool, and they will cheerfullly help you with their sizeable selection of wine and draft beers.  Yum!    Just remember that your \"favorite dish\" may not be there next time.  They totally switch their menu up every season, and more often than not, my favorites get botched.  There is never an issue finding new favorites, but just know this so you're not disappointed.  The Parlor is a solid five stars and is really suitable for anyone (kids, elderly, and whatever we are considered to be).  I would bring my pickiest friends and family here knowing that they are going to love it as I do.  There is valet parking, but the guys are always cool about letting you park yourself, which is huge to me.",

Well, on Saturday afternoon a homeless dude pushed his junk-filled shopping cart up to the restaurant entrance, 'parked' his cart, and dragged his raggedy-clad ass inside and was guided by the clueless hostess to a big booth near ours.  That is one clue (but not our first or only clue) as to how clueless the folks were at The Parlor this past Saturday.  We sat and immediately ordered food and informed our server we were short on time as we were headed to catch a flight at PHX.  Of course that basically assured that our server would take forever (15 min) to get our bill delivered and (10 min) our payment processed.  And though she was not very busy during our mid-afternoon visit she did not bother to (ever) notice we were one set-up short at our table.  Clueless...  The food here is always solid though not a great value.  3.5 star pizzas.  Years ago when first opened they used to be more adventurous and cutting edge with the menu, but these days they have settled on less - interesting 'safe' items geared more towards families and less sophisticated tastes.  Daily happy hour out on their patio is probably the best route:  discounted small pizzas and beer.  Merits 4 stars if coming during happy hour.  And if you hit the skids and fall upon hard times - know that despite your lack of appropriate dress and obvious personal hygene failures -  you and your shopping cart apparently will still be welcome here at The Parlor.

The Parlor is a fun atmosphere and service is always on point.  The pizza is fantastic but I am not sure 2 $$ really actually portrays the pricing, I think its more in the $$$ range.",

They had seating at the bar, indoor seating, as well as a nice patio with outdoor seating. We got there during happy hour on Sunday evening so it was pretty busy, however we still got excellent service and our food came very quickly. We split a mozzarella in corrozza salad to start - it was a nice bed of leafy greens topped with a huge (and I mean huge) ball of breaded and fried mozzarella, all wrapped in prosciutto. It was great (I mean fried cheese, how could it not be?). We took advantage of the happy hour special on 8 in. pizzas. I ordered the 'funghi' which had mushrooms and truffle oil (my all time favorite combo) -delicious! My boyfriend ordered 'the house' pizza which had bacon, kale, and giardiniana - he loved it (I tried a bite and liked it too). The 8 in. pizzas have 6 slices - perfectly sized for 2 people or for one person to have a few slices to bring home and save for later.",

We did the special of $35 for bottle and pasta and the first bartender explained completely differently then what the second bartender had to say or what was on the bill.  I think the bill probably read correctly but I didn't understand it. I wish that things were handled in a better manner especially when I let them know how important this dinner was to me before my client arrived. The first bartender should have introduced us to the person relieving him but instead we were left wondering who was taking care of us and how the bill was changed without letting us know.  When you have been in the industry it just makes it worse and obviously I have higher expectations.  The manager did come by after and really tried to make things right because I was frustrated and at this point it was far too late. Food is always delicious, usually the service is on point, tonight just wasn't our best night. Still love them but left frustrated. I look forward to coming back to a better experience:",

It was Woodford Reserve, with the perfect amount of bitters, and a marasca cherry on a sprig of toasted rosemary.  Mmmmmm! Service has always been polite and prompt.  The place has a nice seat yourself bar area where you can booze it up (as long as you have a DD) and wait for your table.  And if you have a big party/larger group, they will take a reservation.",

Pepperoni , mushroom and bbq chicken pizzas were great. I gave 3 stars because of very POOR customer service , it was a slow afternoon but the service was worse than any busy 6-7 pm on Saturday. Our server never introduced himself: anything to drink ? Ready to order ? Ready for a check ? I swear these were whole 3 sentences he said through our entire dinner. He never even checked to see if our food was ok , someone else delivered it to our table!",

    "text": "UPDATE: The food at Parlor is always amazing, but Customer Service is important too. I used to work in the food industry, so hospitality and professionalism are things I appreciate and to be honest, expect at a nicer restaurant. Yesterday I went with a group of colleagues to the Parlor, (my recommendation, having steered my boss away from their competition). My manager asked for me to head over there ahead of the group to get the table because they do not take reservations. I called ahead and the 'manager' I spoke with said that should be fine, or at least I thought that's what he was saying.  Flash forward, I get to the Parlor with an associate and I tell the hostess our situation and with an attitude she tells me, \"that's not what we do here,\" and that \"you'll have to wait till the majority of your group gets here\" which by her math is 8 people for a party of 10. I told her everything seemed OK on the phone and we left work early to hold the table for the business dinner, not to mention it was slow and it should have been easy (and a no-brainer) to accommodate a party that size bringing in that kind of cash on a Monday night.  The manager came to explain that it was my misunderstanding, that he didn't say we could sit at the table and that we could wait in the bar area and blah blah why don't buy drinks and appetizers and leaving work isn't so bad and other sarcastic half-hearted remarks. Clearly the customer isn't always right at The Parlor, even when they're actually right. Meanwhile, the hostess who was obviously irritated with my request glared in our direction and when the group arrived and I asked if we could be seated was very snippy. She was also very upset when I asked for them to move the group bar tab (since we couldn't wait at the table) to the table tab -- it was not explained to me before that this wasn't how they do things.  I was really disappointed. The food at the Parlor is fantastic and I'm always telling people what a great spot it is and last night they went out of their way to not go out of their way. This isn't a chain restaurant, there were not enough people dining there to justify those restrictions and the manager was almost as rude as his extremely immature hostess and completely unprofessional. I've been eating there for years and while I might go back I'll never bring them a group that size again.",

    "text": "After hearing rave reviews for The Parlor, it certainly had a lot to live up to. And my first visit last week, it definitely won't be my last.   My dinner buddy and I headed to the Parlor after work on a Thursday to find the place packed. Good sign. We made a beeline straight to the bar and admired the warm recycled wood accents and sleek contemporary look. I had the basil gimlet and she sipped on garden mojito, and they were both refreshing and delicious.  It was hard to choose from the delectable menu but decided to take advantage of the DIY sheet. We chose a meat and cheese plate with Humboldt fog (nice and clean), manchego (nutty goodness) and salami (salty and delicious).   Then we decided to pick two 8\" pizzas, and they ended up being more than enough. My friend had the barbecue chicken pizza that had a tart BBQ sauce, perfectly cooked chicken and fiery mini jalapeno peppers. We created another pizza with fresh tomatoes, wild mushrooms, homemade sausage and mozzarella, topped with pecorino and oregano. I liked that you could add herbs and pick your cheeses. The whole combination was heavenly, but could have used a bit more mushrooms. I especially loved the chewy yet airy crust.   A minor complaint: My friend and I were quoted at a half hour wait and told the hostess we would be at the bar. When we checked in after 20, my friend noticed that a couple parties of two listed after us had already been seated. If I wasn't enjoying my basil gimlet so much, I would have been a bit more peeved but the hostess got us seated right away.",

It was packed with a line out the door within a half hour of our arrival.  I had an interesting Moscow Mule that had cucumber in it as well as the standard ingredients; served in the copper cup.  Very refreshing!  My friend had a Mojito.  We then ordered the bone marrow appetizer and a meat and cheese plate.  I had never had bone marrow before, but know it's a foodie fave so I wanted to try it.....  Meh....It just tasted like a little piece of beef fat spread on really good toast.  The meat and cheese plate was awesome.  We had a cheese that had been rubbed with espresso during the aging process....I'd never had coffee-cheese.... lip smackin good....and a burrata , which is housemade mozzarella molded around shreds of the same mozzarella mixed with cream.....OMG, run and order it now!  There was also pepper jelly and pesto dipping sauces on the side which were very good.    On to the salad....We split an heirloom tomato, watermelon, feta cheese, pistachio and Frisee salad that was out of this world.  I thought my friend was going to lick the plate it came on!  Finally, we split a pizza.  We picked our ingredients and chose Pepperoni, roasted Queen Creek olives, wild mushrooms, and fresh basil....It was wonderful.  The crust was chewy and crusty, thin with just the right amount of char.  The sauce was great and toppings even better! Even our server was great.  I had a delightful time and highly recommend The Parlor!",

As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a warm and sincere smile, and that same enthusiasm was felt by every single staff member we encountered.   Ah the food!  Fresh ingredients, a great light pizza crust, and an original beet salad all  had us raving.   The only minor picky foody issue was the Nectarine Crustada for dessert was luke warm at best, would have liked a nice hot dish to melt that delicious ice cream.    But why nit pic?

Against better judgment I gave the Parlor a second chance for my girlfriend's sister's birthday gathering. I figured since the manager had written me the following:  \"The chefs and I are double checking all of the procedural practices during prep and service to make sure it is not a systematic error.  I'm pretty sure we've eliminated any possibility of this being a repeat occurrence.  Unfortunately, like you mentioned, this stuff happens more often than it should in all kitchens, but I can GUARANTEE you that if you should decide to pay us another visit this won't happen again here.\"  that it wasn't going to happen again.  And yet, there I was, later that evening, having a hard time breathing, sweating, breaking out in hives on my face and hands, all indications that I had YET AGAIN been cross contamination poisoned by The Parlor.  Once should have been enough. I should have listened to my gut, given the gift card to a friend without life threatening allergies, and just gone on my merry way. But I'm dumb, and I let myself get talked into the Parlor again. Normally I have a \"Try to kill me\" one strike rule, but I really wanted this to work out.   Never again Parlor. Just not worth the risk to my health and long term plans to be here for Z-Day...",

Service was great with attentive trendy looking servers.  Prices were cheaper than I expected.   The pizza I ordered  coming out of a wood fired oven was amazing.

I have been to several adorable restaurants recently, they all had decent food and a good atmosphere. This, however, exceeded my expectations without exceeding my budget. We started off with some cheeses and meats. They are served along side a delicious flat bread and two dipping sauces (pesto and fruit salsa). The pesto was SO fresh the basil must have come directly from the immense garden they have flourishing outside! Every single thing I put in my mouth was delicious, including the wine. The PIZZA though, the PIZZA was to die for! The cheese was perfect, the crust soft, crispy and little sweet, and the ingredients all complimented each other so well. I cannot wait to go back and try a different concoction. I would definitely come back even just to have some wine and appetizers at the bar though. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the service could have been a tad better. It wasn't bad at all, just could have been a bit more attentive is all.",

I was a little disappointed with my Smokey Pizza as they were so damn skimpy with the proscuitto and then covered the thing with arugula. That's all I could taste was greens. The crust was also a bit doughy for my taste. This is all down to personal preference, however.  The waiter was very kind and was probably the best thing about the place. They look like they tried to create a postino/vig hybrid atmosphere, and while it was nice inside and airy, I don't see how everyone is raving about how they kept the old salon intact. It looks nothing like that old salon did. NOTHING.  3 stars for average. I guess I shouldn't have been expecting to be blown away. There are too many amateur hour reviewers on this site.",

I would have to say they have some of the best bruschetta around and if you want brick oven pizza I would suggest this place over Pizzeria Bianco any day of the week...plus that there is never a two hour wait!  I would say they are a bit pricey! But the food definitely doesn't make you feel cheated. And what I really like about the decor of this place  is the little veggies on the vine as you walk into the front door gives this place a cool vibe. Kind of a modern place. Like the lay out quite a bit.   Only down fall is the seats at the bar are not very comfortable and the do not have a foot rail so your kind of hanging there and the booths can be a bit small if your a big guy like me but that aside this place is the bomb.",

I've heard great things about the food and that the service was sub-par and to say sub-par is an understatement.  In my opinion our service totally sucked.  Here's why.  I met a friend there for dinner around 5:15 last night-before the rush.  There was our table plus another 2 or 3 in the whole place.  It took at least 15 minutes for our server to come back after bringing us waters to take our order.  We each ordered the 8\" make your own pizza-mine was easy.  Cheese, vine ripened tomatos plus spinach.  We both got side salads-which were really good and fresh with tasty homemade dressings.  The pizzas came out and it didn't look like there was spinach on mine-and there wasn't.    I patiently waitied about 5 minutes or so for the waitress to come see if our food came out alright and I told her that mine didn't have the spinach on it.  She says \"i'll go put spinach on it.\"  she leaves and returns a couple minutes later with my pizza.  She sets it down and walks away.  The spinach she put on my pizza was cold and wet and just piled on top.  I look at my friend and say \"What am I supposed to do with this?\"  First I am 3 1/2 months pregnant-you don't mess with a pregnant womans food but I have NEVER been given pizza topped with cold wet spinach.  I don't eat it and wait for her to come back.  She returns and I say \"I really hate to be a pain the ass\" and she she says something under her breath but all I hear is \"somewhat\"  I ignore it and ask her if she could have the kitchen sprinkle a smidge more cheese on the top and pop the pizza back in the oven so that the spinach isn't cold and wet.  She snips \"if they put the pizza back in the oven it will get charred-just so you know.\"  I'm thinking-they screwed it up and now if I want it fixed it will be burnt?  I say \"can they just put it in there for like, 20 seconds so the cheese melts?\"  she says (rudely) \"I'll see what I can do but I'm going to have to charge you for extra cheese\"  (each topping is a dollar).  I say fine, whatever.    She brings me my pizza back and it isn't charred-lucky for her.  And when we got our bill she didn't charge me for the extra cheese-which I would've just taken out of her tip anyway.   the food was good but like I said horrible service.  I'll have to really, really want to go there again to endure being treated like that again.",

They actually grow an assortment of their own vegetables right on their own patio, how cool is that! Not to mention it's a very inviting space.   Inside was no different, it was modern and hip but comfortable too.   I was pleased with the menu, descriptive offerings reasonably priced.   My friend and I ordered the Arancini which is Fried Risotto Balls with cheese snuggled on a bed of pomodoro sauce (see pics) These are just Delicious!! You could make a meal of these I wish the serving was larger.   I also ordered the Funghi Pizza that had Wild Mushrooms, Goat Cheese, Truffle Oil and Chives. Yum Yum! (see pics) At 8in. it was easy to eat by myself, but would have been plenty to share as well.  The goat Cheese gave it just the flavor it needed to be great, some fresh herbs would have only improved it's greatness.   My friend did the build your own pizza and got Spinach, Tomato and Basil, my battery died so no pics, sorry. We swapped slices and I really liked hers as well.   I had other plans for dessert so we didn't order here but I know I will be back, they have so many fabulous items I want to try and I just love the space too.   They said they were working on updating the website to include the menu so hopefully soon you will be able to click and drool, but for now read these reviews and look at the pics, then head immediately over to The Parlor!   Just a Tip: It's located directly across the street from Best Buy on Camelback and 20thST, it's easy to miss, but that should help you find it!",

    "text": "Blink and you'll miss it, but The Parlor in central Phoenix is worth seeking out.  It was just as busy when I went there a couple months ago as it was when I checked it out almost 3 years ago, with a half-hour wait for two at 8:30 p.m. on a Friday night. If you do have to wait, the twinkly light-lit patio is a pretty place to hang out since it's surrounded by a garden that provides ingredients for the restaurant, and the patio is also a romantic secluded area you should try to score a seat on if you can. The bar area is also cool, with close quarters (you might be at the same long table as another party) and a single television displaying whatever sports game is on.  The Parlor the restaurant is housed in a former beauty parlor, with evidence of a hair drying station placed in the women's bathroom. Other than that, you'd never look at The Parlor as anything different than a cool eatery, ever-busy with hipster servers and high-quality food on seasonal menus.  Pizza is a specialty here (the owner's family also owns Nello's in Ahwatukee), and it's really affordable and really tasty. If you're planning on eating one yourself, definitely order an 8-incher-that's more than enough food to keep you full. I built my own with goat cheese and mixed olives ($10), and I liked the thin, soft middle with the thick and crispy crust.  My companion ordered the veal raviolini ($13.50), which came with a ginger carrot puree and peas and baby carrots. He said the concept was surprising to him, but it worked. The pasta is all made in-house, and he really liked it.  The drinks at The Parlor are just as good as the food. The Jalisco Sunrise ($10) is a spicy concoction of roasted serrano infused Corzo tequila, pink grapefruit, cilantro and lime and is a great desert drink because of the spice-the grapefruit really balances it out well, though.  I also love the Cucumber Lemonade ($8), a refreshing mix of cucumber, lemon and Hendrick's. It's strong but doesn't taste like it.  The Parlor is wonderful in so many ways-drinks, food and atmosphere. Just be prepared to valet your car, and arrive earlier than you'd like to sit down.",

That said, I went here because of the weeks on end that this place was the top of the Yelp charts and I was sadly underwhelmed. Not that there is anything wrong with this place it's just not anything I'd claim to be out of this world.  I had a peperoni pizza and it's nowhere in the league of Pizza A Metro or Cibo ... it's just plain old pizza ... nothing great ...",

They use a lot of unique and interesting ingredients and are unwilling to compromise their culinary vision (when we asked to have a particular ingredient on only half of our pie, the waiter took the stick out of his ass long enough to tell us that \"Chef doesn't DO halves\"). Nevertheless, the food is good and I would go back occasionally.",

    "text": "So if anyone's read my past reviews everyone knows I have had the best pizza in Portland.   We have been to Cibo and Pizza Bianco and we didn't care for either of them. Just wasn't up to par with my expectations. So we came in very skeptical.   First off they offer free valet which is the bomb. Second the fact that they took an old salon and refurbished the material and reused it in the new space. We loved the interior. Just so welcoming and inviting. The bar area looked so awesome.   We were sat right away. We looked over the menu and decided on the calamari appetizer, spinach salad and the sausage pizza. I ordered a glass of wine also.   I wish we could find a place that would do calamari like Ken's where it's sauteed instead of fried but alas It was still pretty good.  The salad was amazing. The spinach was so fresh and the bacon was so crispy and yummy! The pizza was the best part though. The crust was thin but not too thin and crispy but chewy at the same time. Not too much sauce and the sausage was so good.   We were really glad we found this place. It's our new pizza place!! We cannot wait to take our friends.",

    "text": "Finally, an excuse to eat pizza every week.  The Parlor is one of those unique spots that has that all-around enjoyable vibe. Not only is the building absolutely stunning (renovated from an old beauty salon), but their food is off the charts.   It's easy to feel a sense of romance if you're seated on the patio; lots of vine covered walls and candles make it the perfect spot to bring a date. Being seated inside is just as lovely-- even in their busiest hour, you can still here yourself think and don't feel overwhelmed by the commotion around you.  I picked out the Margherita pizza and a pint of Kiltlifter the first time I was there, and loved the combination so much I never even bothered trying anything else. True bliss.",

    "text": "I've been to The Parlor on a few occasions and have never had a bad experience here.  We shared the roasted beet salad, polipo, 12\" funghi, and had tiramisu for dessert.  I don't eat beets often, but I'm a fan now after having tried the salad.  It's really refreshing, and I highly recommend it.  The polipo was suggested by our server as \"the best octopus in the valley\", so we went with it.  We were disappointed; it had a nice spicy kick to it, but it was way too salty for our palates (you've been warned).  I've had the funghi before, and it remains one of my favorites.  If you like mushrooms, you'll love it (no skimpin' here).  The tiramisu was pretty good, although we thought that it had a little too much cocoa powder going on on top, and that it needed an extra coffee-flavored oomph to it.  We ordered too much, but we were starving!  Overall, a great meal paired with an awesome pitcher of Oak Creek Nut Brown Ale.  Yummmmmmmmm.  It was a nice night to sit out in the patio.  It tends to get kind of noisy inside, so if you want to actually converse, try to sit outside if you can.  Also, parking is kind of tough unless you get there early (or park across street at the shopping center), but they do offer valet.  I'm still full!",

I always thought this place was cool,because, it was mid century modern.But, now it is a restaurant, and it is cooler than ever! I came here with 3 friends for lunch. It is a little hard to find if you have never been here before. So make sure to pay attention as it is on the North side of Camelback road. You pull in and park in the back.  They have done such a great job bringing it back to life! The atmosphere is relaxed and 60's. Early 60's , I love it. The menu is amazing. They make all the Pasta from the start right there and it is fabulous! They even offer a Gluten Free pasta,which is amazing as well. I can tell you that was not around in the 60's. I got the seafood with linguine. It was great!! My friends got the steak salad and it too was divine. Next time we might get the pizza. Everyone says that is awesome as well.  The place is decorated wonderfully. When it is cool enough outside you can sit on the Patio. They even grow their own herbs right there in their garden. I am always Happy when I see a cool Ladies Room. This is right up there. Even with a cool hair dryer chair. Look at my photos. Cool place, Wonderful Food. Worth a visit.",

Your immediately greeted upon entering with options to eat in the bar area, large open dining room or outdoor garden area with misters.  Service was slow but we eventually ordered some cocktails, i got the ciao bella and my husband got the smoke and mirrors. Mine was a coffee based drink and was rich with velvety chocolate tones yum, my husband was not so enticed by his, it tasted like liquid hickory coals just way too overpowered with smoke.  They have a unique way of ordering antipasta, its almost setup like a sushi order sheet were you can pick and choose what will come on your butcher board. I liked that alot of the options were locally sourced as well. It arrived looking like a work of art and was a delicious start to the meal.   My husband ordered the seafood linguine and the yukon gold pizza. I got the summer corn risotto and the funghi pizza with no cheese. We wanted to share a pizza but they wouldnt allow us to split toppings which was disappointing. My risotto was creamy and packed with roasted corn flavors and i loved the crunch that came from the corn fritters on top, it was a nice change of textures. My pizza was very generously laden with mushrooms, didnt get any of the advertised truffle flavor though which would have really set it over the top, not a memorable pizza. My husbands linguine had great flavor and a nice spice with perfect al dente housemade noodles but the quality of the seafood was just not there. I know were in a desert but we've gotten much better quality in the area. He did enjoy his pizza though, he said it was like a loaded baked potato and pizza had a baby.  We were too stuffed to try dessert and had to get togo boxes for the pizzas. Service was slow again to get our check but she was polite. All in all the food was good and the restaurant had a romantic ambience, it was just lacking in that excitement, nothing blew us away in terms of flavor and creativity. Dont think well be back but it was still a nice dinner date.",

We sat at the bar for 3 hours! I didn't drink 3 hrs of liquor, but I definitely ate 3 hrs of food. Noise level was quiet enough that we could carry on a decent conversation of \"catch-up!\"  I started with a margarita (of course), moved on to a Garden Mojito, then to an 8\" Market Pizza . . . next a black cherry tart and an Americano. I usually judge a place by their margarita and by their coffee. Most places in town have acceptable margaritas and just so-so coffee.   The Parlor had a really good margarita and the Americano was worth going back for if you have nothing else!    The special market pizza was unusual enough that I can honestly say it was the most unusual pizza I think I have ever had. What was it? You have to go while it is still on the menu to try it yourself.   The cherries in the tart were great, but the tart shell was just a little too overdone for my taste. Hard. If you must have one, eat the cherries and the ice cream on top. Leave the shell.  Go for the Americano!!",

    "text": "The Parlor is racist. A group of 11 young Latinos walked up to the front desk and ask to be seated. We were told please wait 20-25 minutes. After a long day visiting all the way from California for a Spring Training baseball game, we were in the mood for some good pizza. After the 20-25 minutes, we asked about our wait where the hostess then answered, it would be another 30 minutes. Fine. We decided to wait. Not only did we wait outside, but it just so happened that every group of Caucasians that arrived after us were all seated before us. Or at least waiting inside, there didn't seem to be room for us with the discriminatory looks we were receiving by our urban apparel. Because we didn't have Gucci loafers or Yeezy's on we seemed to be looked down upon as if we weren't good enough to be there. After the hour wait we waited for a little while longer to come to grips with the fact that after wasting our time, we were told our group would have to be split. Really? Pathetic. Customer service was subpar to say the least. It seems that the homegrown fruits and vegetables in the garden out front didn't reflect homegrown values or principles of common courtesy or respect for all colors of people. If you're between the age of 18-28, take it from me. Go somewhere you'll be respected. Being young doesn't give an organization the right look down upon us. I felt categorized, undermined and disrespected. And parking sucks.",

    "text": "So we call this place about 20-30 minutes before arrival and ask for a wait time... they said \"no wait time we should be able to seat you shortly after you show up\". Well overall his place smelt alright... from the outside we pull up and I understand we have a party of 11 but don't tell us our wait is only going to be 20-30 minutes when The reality is us going to end up waiting over an hour and not be seated at all... what made it even worse is when the server comes out to tell us \"I'm just a server so I can't do anything but we're still working on getting you seated\" like bud you could've told us that 30 minutes ago instead of leaving us there chillin outside for a minute with no word on when we were going to be seated.. highly DO NOT recommend this place especially with a group not only because of the wait but also because of the lack of consideration. Very unprofessional in my opinion. Ruined about an hour of our buddy's bachelor weekend in Arizona (we're from Cali) ended up at chick fil A and got way better service ... would never return .. thank you",

We arrived on Saturday night, when it seemed to be a packed house. The hostess assured us it would be no more than a half hour wait. We waited for over an hour while watching multiple parties seated before us who arrived after we did. We did not receive any updates on the status of our party until we asked the hostess how much longer it would be. She stated it would be another 30 minutes but if we chose to sit outside it would be sooner. We stated we would. Finally after another half hour a server, came outside and told us, they would able to seat us \"soon\", but \"unfortunately\" they would not be able to set us together. After almost 2 hours! Couldn't have that been stated sooner? They did not have the courtesy to apologize for the for overly long wait or, the inability to accommodate us when we were assured they could. Maybe if those things would have happened, this review wouldn't have been written, but they didn't, and it has been. None of us will be returning.",

Don't get me wrong, it's tasty and if you're in the neighborhood or get invited to dinner definitely go and try it out for yourself but if you want the best then look elsewhere. I prefer Cibo to any other pizza place in town. What I do like about the parlor is that it has a happy hour which the other pizza places mostly do not. I know people that really like this place so definitely give it a try if you're curious.",

    "text": "We got takeout from here; our first time trying this place, even though it has caught our eye for quite sometime. The pictures attached, are at home, on the plate.   When we called to order, they answered by the second ring, which is something I appreciate. They were friendly, and informative. It was an easy process.   Parking was open and good, even though when we went inside to pick up our order, the restaurant was pretty full (on a Sunday night around 7:45) with young, trendy people. This wasn't surprising as it matched the decor, young and trendy. I really liked the vibe and atmosphere inside the restaurant, and we can't wait to go back to experience the very nice patio outside.   The price was a little high, but not crazy. We ordered the spicy seafood linguine, the large one which is enough for two people, and a beet and goat cheese salad. The pasta was decent, not the best I have ever had. They give you a nice amount of shellfish, which is good, but the sauce lacked the \"wow\" factor. I would have done something different with that recipe. We enjoyed eating it though. The salad was though, phenomenal. It had an arugula base, beets, sweet potatoes, and a piece of crispy goat cheese. The dressing paired well and the salad is something I would try again.   Again, we did takeout, but this place did a lot of things right. We can't wait to go back again and try one of the pizzas where the topping choices look superb.",

    "text": "Let me see you toss it up since this is supposed to be the #1 pizzeria in Arizona. I'm always searching for our next unforgettable dining experience and came here with high expectations of their famous pizzas.   Since I arrived during Happy Hour (3-6pm daily), I decided to take advantage of their special pricing on food and cocktails. My hankering directed me towards a refreshing glass of white sangria ($5). The fruity stiff mixture had a great kick of white wine and fresh fruit. One more glass and I would have been dancing on the tables. On another occasion, I ordered the red but will stick to the white because I loved it with the fruits.  In total, I've tried four pizzas during Happy Hour to get a sense of their fine crafted pizzas (8\" for $7.50). In order of my preference:  Funghi - roasted mushrooms, goat cheese, truffle oil, chive Pesto - roasted tomato, house made mozzarella, basil pesto, pine nuts Puttanesca - calamari, shrimp, capers, spicy tomato sauce, olives, fennel, Calabrian chile Vine Ripe Margherita - fresh vine ripe tomato, house made mozzarella, basil, olive oil  If you love mushrooms, you must bookmark this place immediately. They were extremely generous with the toppings and the earthy texture made each bite filled with funghi happiness. I opted for light goat cheese because I'm lactose challenged and watching my calories.   Try the Pesto if you love basil because you'll enjoy the saltiness of the green sauce in each bite. They serve it with cherry tomatoes compared to sliced red tomatoes.   The Puttanesca was also a great choice for those wanting a little more substance and protein. I especially loved the spicy tomato sauce as it added more depth to the dough and toppings.   Finally, the traditional Margherita showcased their homemade mozzarella all put together in each slice. The tomato slices are more of the full sized compared to the ones served on the Pesto. Again, I would have liked it more but too much cheese doesn't make me a happy gal.  Overall, all these pizzas exceeded our expectations because the dough had a chew while not being too tough. Our initial visit, we thought the dough was softer compared to our subsequent experience and missed that taste and texture.   Add more carbs to your meal and order the tiramisu ($8)! For any coffee and chocolate lover, this dish will seal your meal. I loved the richness of the espresso soaked ladyfingers upon layer and layer. The sprinkled toffee bites around the dessert made this dish 5 star worthy.  Inside, the dark wooden dining area has booth and table seating and the outside dining is covered from the sun. Towards the back is a full bar complete with high tables and tvs. This is definitely a great place for a date, or catching up with friends. The parking lot fills up quickly in the back. Service here was attentive and not too intrusive as we like.   Is it our favorite? TBD!  Play on, play on...",

I can't remember the name of appetizers. It was great. A little noisy for my taste. The pace is a little dark to take photos for food. Visited the bathroom and took a picture it was clean and nice. Love the decor.",

However, on July 27th, I ventured to this establishment alone and my experience changed. I went during lunch and for me the vibe was off from the very start. In what was an pretty moderately filled space the waitress attempted to sit me miles from other people. I objected and asked for a booth. I then was attempting to browse the menu and she interjected and stated that the menu I was browsing was for bottles. Mind you I have eaten in this restaurant over 30 times now with my friends. I decided against ordering a bottle. I told her to leave the menu and I might order a drink later. She took my order and I was very clear I wanted a large pizza. I waited for my meal only to be given a small. This is still not the worst part. She had other tables and she interacted with them completely different. They received great attentive customer service. I was left alone and only offered a refill once. The people in front of me never saw an empty glass. My spirit said no tip but I realize that this is how most waitresses feed there families and so what could have been a 10 tip which is what I tip when I get great customer service turned into a 5 dollar thank you for working tip. I hope this review get the restaurant to see that all customers matter not just groups that have higher tipping potential.",

Started with a bottle of Rose' and the Frito Misto.  Very good.  We then ordered 2 11\" pizzas both done as ordered.  Mentioned to our server ( again) that it was my friends birthday and I could use the yelp app for %50 off a dessert. He didn't bat an eye and so we ordered the chocolate cake....with a press coffee and 2 cellos.  So needless to say... I was surprised to come home to my receipt to find I was charged $8 for the dessert. Really?  As you can guess.... it's not about the $8.... but the fact that not only were there Birthday gifts on the table.... and I mentioned the %50 off from yelp.   Just disappointed in that.  I know I'll be back... but I will make sure I just use my yelp app.",

Had the calamari which was AMAZING by far on the top 5 I've had here in AZ. The service was quick. I ordered the bolognese added some crushed red pepper and done. Delicious.

It's easy to miss driving by and I wouldn't have paid much attention to it except for the fact that my neighbors raved to me about it. When it came out in Phoenix's magazine as one of the top 10 pizza places in Phoenix I knew I finally had to try it.  Happy hour is everyday from 3-6 so I decided to come at 3 on a Saturday for a late, late lunch. There was plenty of seating and parking available but I can tell how this place would fill up quickly at night - especially the parking.  Good waiter, good service. I went with a classic pepperoni pizza and a draft beer, both of which were part of the happy hour menu. All of their pizzas are $7.50 during happy hour! The pizza was delicious. Thin crust that has flavor but not so thin that you feel like you're eating a cracker. It was baked perfectly. I enjoyed eating the crusts as much as I enjoyed the pizza. The pepperoni and mozzarella were plentiful and delicious.  This place has good ambiance and would be great for a night out with friends or date night. I ended up getting a scoop of chocolate gelato as the Yelp check-in deal gets you 50% off a dessert. It was incredibly rich dark chocolate gelato. A great finish to a good meal.  I'm excited to come back and try some of their pasta very soon!",

I still give the edge to Pizzeria Bianco I personally think their pizza is better and the best in AZ for this stile of pizza. The service was excellent and friendly.

It was sooooo good I wish I could back up and eat it all over again. I know that the owner (Aric) and a biz partner (Matt) are going to open the Farm at Los Olivos.

    "text": "First and foremost if I were about to read a review such as the one I am about to write I would rush to The Parlor immediately. However, no matter what type of reviews you read it still does not do it justice. It is just that good.   I will start by saying my review is simply based on the items I tried and what impressed me about The Parlor.   I was with a party of 7 and was advised there would be about a 45 min wait. I wasn't really surprised as it is a popular place and it was a Saturday night. However we were told that if we sit in the bar area we can seat ourselves. It just so happens there was a high top available that could seat all of us so we took it.  I had no expectations on what the service would be like and I really couldn't compare the bar area to the dining room. What I can say is that the service was great and the server was prompt and very honest and sincere which is appreciated.   We started off with some calamari. I know what you are thinking. CALAMARI at a pizza parlor? Yes, and it was to die for.  The calamari was one of the best I have had. Not too much breading, not too crispy or crunchy. Just really good.   Now on to the pizza. The reason we came here. The pepperoni. I mean wow. The pepperoni was stellar. My palate was in overload. You can taste the fresh dough. The sauce. The cheese. I really don't have enough words about the pepperoni.   The spicy BBQ Chicken pizza was also very good but too spicy for my taste. The jalapenos were fresh and very hot. If you are into that than go for it but for me I like to taste more than just fire in my mouth.   For dessert  the waiter suggested the Tiramisu cake. Now let me say this, Tiramisu is my favorite desert. I will also say that my parents have been in the pastry industry for over 50 years and I have never tried Tiramisu as good as this one. This is easily the best I have ever had. I will also say I have had Tiramisu in Italy and all over Europe. Yet for whatever reason this one is my top. If you are getting dessert you have to try it.   Overall super pleased with The Parlor and will be returning in the future.",

My favorite menu item is the house pizza and I'm not even a pizza or bacon person. It's just so delicious, you feel good that you ordered a pizza covered in kale and veggies, but yet it's so indulgent with the mozzarella and perfectly smoky bacon, the additional tartness and spice from the giardiniera provides a nice brightness to it - it's awesome, go get it! They do have a nice cocktail menu, and I've found the bartenders provide great customer service. The reason I gave 4 stars is because of the service, I've had consistently slow service from the servers. Please don't let that deter you, it's a fantastic place.",

    "text": "I've been here twice now, once for drinks and then most recently back to try the food. We came in on a Sunday night and were seated quickly. The waitress was helpful in explaining some of the dishes and making suggestions. We ended up ordering the garden board which was a variety of roasted veggies and a hummus like sauce that was delicious. We also got the cauliflower as an appetizer and that was good as well. For a salad we ordered the chicken Milanese, I'm not a fan of most salads but this was decent. The lettuce was crisp and green and the dressing wasn't overpowering. Now for the main reason we came to dine at the Parlor: the pizza! We got the buffalo chicken, margherita and the spicy Florentine. The margarita left me underwhelmed, but I suppose it is difficult to make a mind blowing margarita. The other two though were delicious. I love the crust, and lightness of the pizza. It doesn't leave you feeling overly full. The spicy Florentine had a great balance of flavors and the barbecue was great because it didn't come with onions (I hate onions) but still had a great flavor. We got the tiramisu and Neapolitan short cake for dessert, both delicious. I'm not a tiramisu fan because I've never really had a good one but that changed after this tiramisu. It was light, decadent without being too much and so flavorful. My only issue with my visit and other visits my friends have had is that we want to order their Alcatraz drink, it comes with a ball of ice that you use a hammer to break but they're always out. Going to try to figure out how to get that drink next time we come so it's a 5-Star visit!",

    "text": "I really want to give The Parlor 5 stars but their customer service last night was really lacking.   First, my party of seven arrived at 6:40pm on a Tuesday night and I get that it was unusually busy for a Tuesday and we had a large group so when they told us it would be a 20-30 minute wait... no problem but after an HOUR of waiting and we still hadn't been seated nor had anyone come to check on us I decided to wait just another ten minutes before leaving but the hostess finally came and told us our table was ready.    Then, our server was painstakingly S L O W.... He brought us all waters to start and then didn't come back for another 10 minutes to take our drink orders so we decided to order our food and drinks at the same time in case he decided to disappear again for another 10-15 minutes.   For these reasons alone, I would give the Parlor 2-3 Stars. With so many great dining options in Greater Phoenix, you really cannot afford to be short-staffed or have bad customer service.   What saved this rating was the food: easily 5 stars. All of their pasta and pizza doughs are made in-house from scratch and it shows. I had the Pappadelle Bolognese but I've tried pretty much everything on their menu and it is all wonderful. I will probably be back but definitely not during peak times.",

The pasta and calamari was also very good. The tomatoes in the caprese salad, however, were unripe and tough. But the rest of the food made up for that completely.   The wait staff could use some additional training on building rapport and attention to detail. There was a mistake where a large tip was added to my bill mistakenly by the waitress. However the owner Aric personally rectified the situation in full and has satisfied me. He provided excellent customer service. This is a great example of a business owner who cares about his customers.   It's a little hard to find from the street, only a small sign saying \"The Parlor pizzeria\". I definitely recommend this tucked away gem of a  restaurant.",

We were first greeted warmly by the hostess. She asked what our preferred seating was and was happy to accommodate. Freyan, I believe his name was, was our waiter. He totally did not seem like he wanted to be there nor did it seem like he wanted to do his job. He did not ask us whether or not we wanted a beverage (boyfriend wanted a beer). Although he did tell us his favorites, he did not come back to our table after leaving us menus for at least 20 minutes. If the restaurant was filled up a little more, we would have been more understanding but it was less than half full (we came in a little after 8pm so well after the dinner rush). finally after 20 minutes he came back without a smile, asked us for our order, and left. Another 20 minutes or so passed before our food came to us. Ten minutes after we got our food, he realized my empty water cup at the end of the table needed refilling. We ordered the cavatelli porchetta, large. Although it was definitely smaller than expected, the food was delicious. Pork was tender and sauce was delicious.   Although the food was delicious, I'm honestly disappointed with this place. My boyfriend and I had high hopes that our night would end so well at a place with such great reviews but our service was so terrible and the portions were so small that we left with a bitter taste in our mouths. I don't think we will be coming back here anytime soon.",

We were told all pasta's and doughs are made in house, and you can really tell! The tortellini, was i think squid ink, and tasted so Mediterranean and traditional! The pizza was spicy cheese something or other, and we were suggested by our server to add sausage, and we were happy we did, it was amazing! The olives were amazing, they were served warm which neither of us had ever had! My husband is Spanish and obsessed with olives, and said he's never had anything like them! You can really taste the freshness in the ingredients, and can taste True spiced and herb flavors, and I think thats what we truly enjoyed.   The ambiance was really sweet and romantic as well, I'm sure its beautiful at night with the strung lights and fireplace.

It's absolutely adorable and you'd never guess just how adorable from busy Camelback Road. Hidden behind those cement walls lie an enclosed patio with a fresh herb garden and plenty of shaded seating. They also have tables in the doorway so if you are torn between eating inside or outside, there's always the option of halfway in between!   Moving on to the food, the pizza literally melts in the mouth. I went to lunch here with fellow yelper Carolyn S who had been here many times before. She went for a pizza and said they were delicious, so I just had to do to the same and I am so happy I did! I got the Funghi pizza which has mushrooms and goat cheese, but I added mozzarella to it for that extra cheesy taste. The pizza crust is soft and crunchy in all the right places. The pizza was heavily topped with mushrooms and the cheeses and had the perfect amount of bite to it with a great taste. I could have finished every last piece but I got about half way there. The cool thing is that they have eight inch pizzas so everyone can order their own pizza which is nice since so many times, people like different pizza toppings.   As I was leaving, I noticed a cool bar on the other side of the restaurant and think this would be a great option for some drinks on a night out.   I can't wait to come back again!",

The outdoor patio is my favorite place to sit because it is open, has shade, and heaters, and it more quiet than inside. I have been here multiple times and I have never been disappointed. For pizza, I go with the Funghi because I am lactose intolerant and they adjust to only use the Goat Cheese and for starters, I love the Cauliflower as well as the Garden Board, always something spicy in it.",

    "text": "JACKPOT!  A friend had told us about The Parlor a few years ago. Apparently we have been quite the slackers. We finally stopped in two weeks ago and it was outstanding.  Ambiance: love it Service: attentive, friendly Food: great menu with plenty of enticing options Cocktails: superb  I ordered the Jalisco Sunrise. The perfect margarita with serrano infused tequila. Brilliant! Not too sweet. Spicy. Delicious.  Husband and I couldn't decide what to order AT ALL so we asked the server for recommendations and went with the Roasted Corn pizza and Parsnip Gnudi to share. The pizza crust was light and fluffy on the inside, just crisp enough on the outside. If I could describe the flavors in this particular pizza as both light and rich then I would. (I can do what I want? Light and rich it is!) Oddly, I felt the same about the gnudi. If you want to eat til you're stuffed, I would recommend either ordering one more thing or choosing a more hearty dish.   With plenty of room for dessert we asked the server to surprise us. He brought out the  Pasticcino: warm, flaky crust filled with fig compote (just sweet enough) and was accompanied by their dark cherry ice cream (rich, tart, and sweet). It kind of reminded me of a fancy toaster strudel. We enjoyed the dessert but would probably try something different next time.   We also ordered two cups of coffee to go with dessert. The coffee here is from Lux. It was brought to the table in a french press and it was terrific! A single french press (just $3) was plenty for the two of us...talk about a good deal.  The Parlor is great for a quiet dinner date or a night out with friends. I can't wait to come back here!",

    "text": "The Parlor is quaint!  Although it's categorized as \"Pizza\" I actually find they serve some amazing things besides pizza (in which you could leave pizza entirely off the menu) so if I may add to the other 80 reviews...YES to the Roasted Beet Salad!  Because it was my lucky day, they had a special appetizer of Zucchini Blossoms stuffed with Spanish Chorizo served with marinated Cannellini Beans. Because Zucchini Blossoms are my new current obsession - they get major props for that alone.  I love the meat/cheese plates. They bring you a menu for special order pizzas and on the back you can pick different types of cured meats and different cheeses to create your own sampler. It's like the non-sushi-meat menu. I'll have the caterpillar...errr....I mean...the Manchego cheese and Prosciutto please!  I had their muddled drinks, but actually think I'd stick with wine next time. The decor was simple with lots of white brick, concrete and warm wood. I love that the bar tables are very long (seats 6), so you end up sharing them with others when it gets busy which makes it just that much more fun.",

Once you enter from the rear (that doesn't sound right) you find a contemporary spot with wood, glass, concrete and subtle light coming thru from Camelback Rd. I have been here a couple times and the food is always spot on! For some reason I always seem to write my review after a few visits. Maybe I like to grade on a curve! That always worked for me when I was a kid. Hahaha. The one thing I would change about this place is the seating at the pizza oven. One, I would lower the bar a little so you can see them make the pizzas and two, I would shut the door to the dishwashing room. Kinda nasty looking at food on the floor and dirty dishes. I see enough of that at my house! With that said, the barber like chairs are very cool. Great place for a date night or with friends! Cauliflower gratin? Seriously, that shit is good!",

It was super oily, and I kinda wish there were napkins to pat down some of the oil. Nonetheless, it was very tasty, and I'm glad we shared, because I probably would have got sick of eating it after a while. We also got the Duck Club Sandwich - which was amazing. Tender duck is hard to make, and this place does it well. The bbq sauce and crispy bacon was just delightful for the sandwich. The fries on the side were well seasoned, and perfectly crisp.  The only bad part of the night were all the Mavericks fans at the restaurant that were cheering after the Lakers lost :(",

    "text": "I'm always on a mission to try something unique, and tonight I found another AMAZING restaurant:  The Parlor.  Boy, it's one exquisite pizza parlor!!!  As we sauntered out of the restaurant, the herb and vegetable garden caught our attention, then I recalled the pleasant aromas of basil and sage that piqued our senses upon entering.  Take a moment to \"oooh\" and \"aaah\" at the massive plants of basil, squash, sage and the like lining the main entrance.    Lacquer-painted white brick, warm wood and metals complement The Parlor's deconstructed vibe. The staff are incredibly honest, helpful and accommodating.  The food may seem simple, consisting mainly of salads, pizza and pastas, but the flavor in each dish is delightfully complex and thoughtfully balanced.  It's perfection.  I had the small spinach salad to start.  This was topped with white balsamic vinaigrette, white cheddar, julienned radish, and hard boiled egg.  Incredibly fresh!    We found it difficult to settle on an entree; did we want pasta?  Maybe a wood-fired pizza?  Or a burger?  There's always the option of building your own pizza...Our waiter kindly steered us in the right direction.  My date had the burger with aged cheddar and I had the spicy barbeque chicken pizza.    This PIZZA!!!  House-made barbeque sauce dressed the slightly chewy (yet crisp) crust, along with provolone, serrano chilies, roasted chicken, grilled scallions and cilantro.  As previously mentioned, the flavors are deliberate--each ingredient proudly hits your taste buds in every bite.  It's heaven.    We were tempted by the dessert menu but decided to stick with coffee.  I had a single decaf french press.  Another simple pleasure to conclude our excellent meal.    Oh yes, I will be back.",

I liked that they let you pair your meats and cheeses and how big or small of a portion you want.  My hubs and I split their light cream sauce pasta and a pizza and both were delish.

And the reality is that no matter how good the food and how free the drinks flow, if you don't have a good staff representating your establishment, the whole experience is tainted.  It took forever for someone to greet me and give me a menu. Seriously, forever. And they were absolutely not busy. It was 8pm on a Monday. I ordered my drink and then when I was joined by my friend, again, it took time for them to be greeted.  When my wine was gone, no one asked if I wanted another - which I did. Instead, at about 9:20pm, someone just dropped off our check and went back behind the bar. I would have ordered another round but felt they didnt want us there. We paid & then left.  The ambience is really great and sticks with a lot of the restaurants in this part of town. I love the area. Maybe someday I'll try again.",

And a little awkward that you are still asking our mutual friend to hook us up, when clearly you don't care as much as you say you do.  Sure, our visit starts off hot and heavy, and I usually end up leaving on neutral terms, but the next day I always end up wishing it was more, and I am beginning to lose faith.   One day you tell me I can order my food without tomatoes and the next day I'm not allowed. Sometimes you forget to bring my wine to my table. Your menu of services usually only offers a couple things tempting enough to try.  I will thank you for finally letting me have cake, but you're still a hit and miss lover and I don't know why you toy with me so. But I'm partially to blame for continually falling for your Roger Sterling appeal.",

Syrah which was supposed to be similar to Raw Power and it was pretty good, and smooth! We ended up sitting at the pizza bar with parlor seats and you can see them making the pizzaa. I ended up having the Funghi which consists of goat chees, portobello mushrooms, garlic and olive oil, can I say delish!!!

The food was great; good fries that are crisp on the outside and extremely tasty, the Funghi pizza is decadent (probably due to the truffle oil), and I highly recommend the tiramisu. I'm happy to have \"discovered\" The Parlor (when really, I seem to be the last one) because I had a good experience and look forward to going back with friends and family.",

    "text": "The Parlor was easy to miss from the road. I work 4 blocks from it and had never noticed it before. It's low profile cinder-block exterior  make it easy to miss from Camelback road. But do yourself a favor, if you've not been there yet, seek it out and go. It has an excellent interior atmosphere, resembling a spacious Manhattan loft that blends seamlessly into a patio seating area complete with large wood burning fireplace.  The beer and wine selection are above average and the pizza was excellent. The only downside I can think of is be careful piling on the additional toppings on your pizza, it can get pricey quickly. We ordered  a 12\" pizza with a great sauce, mozzarella, goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes, and grilled chicken (excellent!). However the 3 additional toppings cost as much as the pizza, nearly doubling its price. All in all, highly recommended.",

If you are a fan of LGO and the Vig this is your place.  Try the mushroom or pepperoni pizza...   I do have a word of warning... be careful when you make your own pizza since before i knew it i had made a $25 12 inch pizza... but that was because i misread the menu... opps",

    "text": "Very cool place. You can easily drive right past The Parlor and never know what you are missing out on. I worked in the area for nearly 2 years and never knew about the Parlor until my office relocated and a friend recommended it to me and I would consider me and my wife foodies. The decor is what I would consider a mix of modern and industrial and it is very upscale casual.   The food is very good . I have tried a few pizzas and I love the fungi pizza so far. It has rich flavors and if you like thin crust, wood burning stove \"fancy\" pizzas then this will hit the spot. Don't be intimidated by the look of the fungi (which if you order it, you must like mushrooms). They use nice oils and don't overtake any flavors with too much cheese.   Salads are very solid choices. I have also had the risotto and would give it a 4 rating. It is very good and rich. Our favorite app or side dish is the cauliflower gratin. This is a cheesy baked cauliflower topped with nice bread crumbs heaven. They have a fairly good wine list to choose from to pair with about anything on the menu.   Overall the service has always been great. They are typically busy, but I would say any wait is worth it. They have 3 different areas for seating. If it is a nice day, the outside patio is nice and they also have the windows open in the bar area seating. The third area is the main seating area and they have a large space in the back they can put together for groups.   If you are looking for a nice business sit down casual lunch, nice Saturday lunch or a solid upscale casual dining in the area, I would definitely recommend you add this to your list and keep your eyes open, because it is very easy to drive right past.",

    "text": "Tonight we tried pasta not pizza. The pasta is 'fatta in casa' (made in the kitchen) and quite good. The Bolognese sauce was good but the Amatriciana was horribly disappointing. It had been reduced too much and tasted like BBQ sauce, it was a bit oily too. Amatriciana is spicy, not sweet. Also, WAY too much sauce on the pasta even by American-Italian standards where already too much sauce is on the pasta.  However I have to say the best part was the desserts. Their dessert chef is a rock star. Try the pezzole or the semifreddo sandwiches. Generous portions and delicious! We also had a slab of chocolate cake with cherries - dense and delicious! I would go back just for the desserts. As for the entrees, I'm sticking with the pizzas next time. I wish they had a wider selection of pizza.",

The highlight of the whole dinner was the squishy bread that came with the cheese plate. Pizza was also good. Big negative was that all 4 pizzas were soggy in the center. Other than that, no complaints. The one with fruit on it was the best. The sausage was typical, but good, the margarita didn't seem to be a winner with the table, I thought it was good. I like that rubbery cheese thing though.. The one with seafood on it was my least favorite.The tiramisu with pine nut brittle was tasty, the chocolate cake was fine.",

Our server was very nice, it was my first time there and she took time to answer my questions fully and such. I ordered a pizza that seems to no longer be on the menu? Wondering if maybe the stuff on it is just out of season or something, because I'd be so sad if it is permanently gone! I got a pizza with butternut squash, marcona almonds, goat cheese, some sort of leafy green, a swirl of balsamic, and marcona almonda. I am completely obsessed with pizza, especially unique pizzas, and The Parlor makes a mean pizza. I inhaled the whole thing in what felt like minutes.

    "text": "If a gal can have a spectacular time while on an uncomfortable date, a place Rocks. So was my first introduction to The Parlor. (Hey, to be fair, I didn't realize a date was in the works. Turns out you can't say yes to just meeting up for drinks. Things are Assumed.)  Anyhoo. My only criticism of The Parlor is how popular it is. I showed up earlier than my fella (not MY fella, the guy) and wasn't sure where to go. This place is *so* popular it's kind of hard to sort out where to stand. The bar was buzzing and the outside area was hopping. So as a single gal I kind of hovered until I could procure wine. If you're with a group of friends the fun vibe of this place provides energy.   Fast forward to an unofficial Yelp event. Heck no! I wasn't going to miss Happy Hour! This time I knew the deal-O about finding the entrance. Tip: Don't drive like a race car driver. The entrance requires sharp precision turning. Miss it and you'll love (really) dealing with Camelback traffic. It's fabulous I tell ya'.  HAPPY HOUR | A Blessed Thing M-Sat (3-6pm) $3 Drafts...aaaaand then I pretty much stopped listening.  But no, wait! The 8\" pizzas are only $7 (!) Ok, fine. More details. There are 16 beers on tap.  Well drinks are five bucks. Additionally there are a handful of appetizers at $5.  BAR Seated like a Queen I met the most Awesome Bartenders. The worst part? I have no idea what their names are. Impeccably dressed they serviced a full bar and were happier than clams. Dressed to the nines. (If that means Hipster Plaid and a bowtie!) I *almost* ordered The Parlor. The amount of care put into producing this gin cocktail was impressive.  PIZZA If you're with a picky eater (ahem, a bad date) the staff is more than happy to modify a pizza on the menu for you. I speak highly of the Salsiccia, Spicy BBQ and the Prosciutto Cotto.   The service here is on a grand scale. Front to back, hostess, bar, table service. I've enjoyed both of my visits. Can't wait to visit to scarf down some more pizza! (Oh! Please note that parties of 8 or more will be billed on one check.)",

    "text": "I toyed with this rating for a while. 4 or 5? Man 4.5 would be perfect! I settled on a 4 based on my first visit, but I can see myself upgrading on future visits.   We all know the history of this building. An old beauty parlor. I love how the building was preserved. There are old photos all over the business and even have parlor chairs at the bar.   Starting from the main door you pass a garden where the cooks grow their own herbs and produce. Very cool, I wish I was good enough to grow all my own herb, but i know they would just wilt up and die.lol.anyways you can see a real,nice cozy patio while you walk up to the door. You are greater by a host to great you if you want a table in the dining room, or you can go right into a small bar area.  Service was good the entire. I really dug the decor.  Hard to explain,  but it was a little dark and just overal hip and romantic at the same time. What I'm trying to say I would feel just as comfortable with my buddies here as if I was on a romantic date with my wife. That is super cool.   Now for the food. We ordered the calamari and shrimp appetizer called Fritto Misto. Wow, when that came out it was just awesome! I couldn't believe how juicy the shrimp were. The sauce was also great for dipping.  I would totally order this again!  For the pizza we ordered the Proscuitto Cotto. It wasn't what I was expecting, even though the server told me. But there was no cheese on the pizza, just proscuitto and a smokey tomato sauce. It was good, but I wouldn't order it again. I'd like to try something with cheese on it next time.  Also while we were dining the music track playing was surprising good! I saw a fellow Yelper that commented in how much the music rocks. He's right, every song was good!    I will be coming back to the Parlor again. This time to try a pizza that more fits me, and I would expect my rating to improve afterwards. Overall The Parlor is a great local Phoenix restaurant. I can't wait to take my out of town friends here",

    "text": "I finally made it to The Parlor!  I first saw a sign for it in one of my regular hangouts, Nellos.  Flash forward several months and one of my friends suggested it for dinner as part of our 'girls weekend\" at the Biltmore.  After a day of spa treatments and pool time, all four of us were very excited to go to dinner.  Walking in, the place was hopping and the staff was welcoming.  We put our names down for a 20-minute wait and put in an order for a bottle of wine (after some kind recommendations from the manager).  After about 10 minutes, we were sitting at our table talking to our very friendly and personable server.  He noticed that one of my friends was pregnant (not sure if it was the belly or the lack of a wine glass that tipped him off) and mentioned that his wife was due any day which sparked a nice conversation of baby names and foot massages.  The worst part of my Parlor experience was trying to decide what I wanted.  It all sounded so delicious, I wanted (ok, still want) one of everything.  For appetizers we decided on Frito Misto (Crispy Calamari & Rock Shrimp) and Arancini (fried Crispy Saffron Risotto balls filled with Fontina).  Both were good, not earth-shattering, but good!  My favorite part (for both dishes) was the sauce that came with it.  For our meal, we split a large Spinach Salad (quite yummy and almost knocked out by the beet salad, but spinach won in the end) and a Funghi pizza.  One anti-mushroom friend did a \"build your own pizza.\"  I didn't try a slice of her pizza, but I did get a chunk of the sausage and it was delicious.  Great seasoning and texture, very fresh.  We were raving about it so much one of my (mostly) vegetarian friends had to try it!  Now, I'm going to need a little time to explain this Funghi pizza.  Just a little context for you, I am having an affair with mushrooms at the moment.  Growing up, my mom hated them.  Mushrooms were not called mushrooms in my house; they were called \"fungus.\"  Not exactly appetizing.  As I got older I reached the point of \"ok, I can tolerate them.\"  A few years later, that turned into \"Eh, their not so bad.\"  And within the last six months . . . \"Mushrooms?  YES, PLEASE!\"  With that being said, this Funghi pizza was life changing.  Who knew wild mushrooms, goat cheese (another current love of mine), truffle oil and chives could create a flavor experience that I will never ever forget?!  Someone at The Parlor knew, and for that I am forever grateful!  In summary, when it comes to The Parlor, I am a fan.  The meal got better and better with each dish and I am so excited for my next opportunity to make the drive from the tuke and return to The Parlor.  I already know I'm getting the Roast Beet salad and a Funghi pizza.",

A large restaurant on Camelback; dimly lit, trendy, and crowded - particularly on a night when many were out celebrating and other restaurants were closed, our 8:00pm arrival landed us the last open two-top in the dining room and greeted by a friendly young woman named Kaelyn suggestions were made and selecting an appetizer, main course, and dessert each we thought that we had over ordered but after a long day of driving, unpacking, and finally reaching our destination in nearly 110F weather we made short work of each plate - the subtly sweet Celebrity Chevre and warm, melted \"Grilled Farmer's Goat Cheese\" particularly memorable amongst the first plates while the every ingredient on both the pizza and the sandwich was fresh, flavorful, and well prepared - the house made mozzarella and bright tomatoes livening up a crisp but toothsome crust and the tomato jam melding the gamey duck and briny bacon quite admirably.  Moving on to desserts - I really have no excuse for not returning to The Parlor for at least some sweets since that visit in July, but it is something I'll definitely have to remedy this summer as both the doughnuts and the budino were excellent - a bit of heat added to both in order to smooth out the sweetness and textures aplenty.  Yet another of the many spaces that locals and 'food nerds' overlook I'd strongly recommend stopping by the Parlor to anyone craving a good pizza but unwilling to wait for Bianco - I'd also urge them to order dessert from one of the few places in town turning out great sweets without the assistance of Tracy Dempsey.",

I went with 2 coworkers and we were quickly sat at a table. The waiter was friendly and gave his opinions on what we should get. Two of us got pizza and one of us got a burger.   The \"Pepperoni\" pizza was great, it had two types of meat, jalapenos and had a great crisp to it. The pizza I got looked more like a salad then a pizza but after i removed the 12 pounds of arugula from the top I found my pizza and it was delicious.   The burger looked very good, but I didn't try any of it. He did comment that the bun was amazing and felt like it was baked fresh. He mentioned it was one of his top burgers in his mind.   So overall the food quality was top class. Why the 3 stars? The value for price.   So the pizza you get is about the same size as Pizzeria Bianco and runs about 14$ per pizza. That is a little high if you ask me. I mean the pizza is good, but not godlike. I can get same quality from NYPD or Mama Mia pizza for half the price, or twice as much for about the same price.   I cant rate the burger value as I didn't taste it, but I think he said he would have it again.   Anyway, I'm not telling people to stay away from this place as the food was very good....just know that you will pay for it through the nose.",

I just despise Camelback Road (if I could review Camelback Road, I'd give it a negative star) Anyways, this trendy little number is right around the corner from my house and I'm not mad about it.  Cinder blocks have never looked cooler and the cauliflower appetizer is not basic; it's so BOMB.  I enjoy the steak salad, too...major.  You should try it. The patio is super romantic and lovely.  I took a hunk from Austin, TX there last night and he loved the place (he's a major foodie). We didn't sit on the romantic patio, but we did exchange polite pleasantries over a bottle of wine and way too much food, in a booth, an hour before closing...I love that it's open until 11 pm but kind of don't love that it's closed on Sundays; that Chick-Fil-A feel you get when you go to the restaurant all stoked on a Sunday to be so disappointed in the parking lot when you arrive.  You cry on your steering wheel. Then you get over it.  Our waitress last night was so rad, by the way (she gets 5 stars). I'm embarrassed to say I don't recall her name (and we don't have our receipt) but she has short blonde hair and if you're out there reading this, let's be friends.",

My favorite thing...something that I have been getting for quite a while is their banana cream trifle.  Best dessert I have ever eaten.  We were disappointed to find last time we went that it was no longer on the menu and replaced with a seasonal pumpkin trifle.  Sad as we were we were willing to give it a try.  If it was even halfway decent we wouldn't have been upset.  It was literally the most disgusting dessert I've ever eaten.  It was sour to the point that I thought it might have been going bad (assured that is how it is supposed to taste).  Sour and pumpkin do not go together.  We both had one bite and then searched the table for something to take the awful taste away.  That banana dessert made the restaurant 5 stars, with out it, it's just another ordinary pizza joint to me.",

And they have it on Saturdays, perfect for a late lunch/early dinner kinda weekend.  The boyfriend and I ordered two pizzas and an appetizer. For the app we got the cheezy cauliflower. I know for some people cauliflower isn't very appealing but this dish was amazing. It's a small dish of cauliflower baked with gooey cheese and topped with breadcrumbs. We quickly gobbled up the whole dish. So actually by the time our pizzas came we ended up not really eating that much of them (even if they were smaller, happy hour sized). We got the pepperoni and the Yukon gold. Both were tasty and the crust was done very well. I wouldn't say the pizzas were amazing but they were very good. Honestly I'd go back for the cauliflower before the pizza.  The atmosphere is great. Obviously a lot of work went into the design of the restaurant and it shows. Make sure you check out the pictures near the bathroom - it shows what the place looked like when it was a salon. The naked lady wallpaper is fantastic!",

    "text": "Totally agree with the average rate of 4 stars!  Let's start with the location. Although parking is bad, there's some relieve with the valet.  The decor is great, the bar is super cool and in general no complaints at all about the lay out, ambiance, etc.  The food is good but not great. A little hit and miss (between good and very good).  The fritto misto was good, the calamari were great, not greasy at all. The shrip were good as well. The dipping sauce could be better/different though. In my opinion it doesn't go with the dish.  The roasted beet salad was pretty good but a little too much onion.   The agnolotti were interesting but forgettable.   It seems that all the food is good but nothing to say \"wow\" besides the desert. The sweet potato cheesecake is out of this world. I would go there just for that!  I almost forgot. The kids spaghetti with meat sauce is great. I might order this the next time. The serving is pretty generous so an appetizer and this plus the cheesecake and you'll be pretty happy.  Definitely a must if your not waiting to be impressed with food. A great place to become a regular.  As a side note it seems that they had an overstock of kale at the kitchen. It was everywhere.  Enjoy!",

We would frequent this spot at least once a month and always took our friends/family here when they visited from out of town. I often find myself wishing there was a location here in San Diego....hint hint! The food is exceptional. You can seriously taste the quality and freshness in the ingredients. You cannot go wrong with the Funghi pizza if you love mushrooms and truffles...who doesn't, right? Don't forget to add a whole egg to your pizza. It takes an already awesome pizza to a whole 'nother level. The service is still super friendly and efficient. The place itself still has that cool, chill vibe that just welcomes you to hang out and really enjoy the food placed in front of you. Great place to gather with friends and have a great time. As long as this place is in business, it will always be on our itinerary whenever we go back to visit AZ.",

    "text": "I was expecting to be blown away by the food but instead I was left hoping I'll be blown away by the food next time.  I went in for lunch last week and ordered a small fungi & goat cheese pizza and Caesar salad.  I actually wanted a \"side salad\" but they have no such thing, only \"regular\" and \"large\" portions.  The server advised that the \"regular\" Caesar was the smallest and the portion was indeed just right.  The greens were fresh and crisp, but the dressing was an unexciting version - I suspect lack of anchovy was the reason for the lack of zing.  The shaved parmesan was top notch and bites that included hunks of that were a success.    The pizza... well, the fungi & goat cheese pizza is a white pizza, no tomato sauce, so instead they compensate with a  ton of mozzarella.  I think there was truffle oil on it too.. all of which sounded good, but resulted in the most oily meatless pizza I've ever had.  Despite my hunger, I was able to eat only a quarter of it simply because I couldn't handle that much oil.  nice taste, OK crust (would have loved it a little crispier), but that oil issue overwhelmed the positives.  Still hungry I ordered a piece of chocolate cake and a coffee.  The chocolate cake was very fresh, and I suspect made on site.  it is a pound cake style; very moist and dense.  However the chocolate taste wasn't as forward as it needs to be to make it a standout.  A gargantuan blob of whipped cream on top was nice, but probably too much richness on top of the rich cake.  So all that made for a \"pretty good\".  The bad part was that the utensil they gave me was a huge serving spoon.  No, not a soup spoon size, a serving spoon size.  Made me feel like a second grader and it was nearly impossible to take normal-sized bites and not end up with the whipped cream all over my face.  I would have asked for a fork but my server picked that time to disappear.  The coffee was served in a  small French press, and delish.  I left a little disappointed, but it was good enough that I want to go back and try other items.  The decor and atmosphere...no matter how many restaurants open with that modern/rustic industrial feel (a la Postino Central, St. Francis, Bomberos...), I just love it and Parlor did a nice job.",

    "text": "I called Frenchy late and asked if he'd eaten and he said no. We picked a place that was close, a new joint on Camelback opposite Best Buy that used to be a hair Salon. He said it was a pizza place but that is not on my healthier new eating plan so he checked the menu and said they had lots of other choices and that if  it looked lame we could go somewhere else. I left the Esplanade and was there in two minutes and was pleased to pull into a BIG new parking lot with plenty of spaces and cars that clearly belong to people who are gainfully employed. Every new place in Phoenix seems to think that parking is optional.Get real, if we wanted that sh*t we'd move to Santa Monica. I like the freedom of having my vehicle and not getting on the light rail or any other b.s. on someone else's schedule.   There was a young guy in the parking lot attending to details and making sure the place was buttoned up. I asked him if I should actually go in and if the place was any good and he cheerfully said YES, with such enthusiasm that I marched right in. I was immediately surprised by the shaded patio which had cool tables, block walls and plants, and the surprise continued when I went in and found a cool, sleek simple space with good music and a lot of happy looking people working, eating and having a late Friday lunch. The service was good, two friendly people greeted me as I looked around to see if my friend was there yet, and I was immediately seated, given water and olives and provided a good fresh iced-tea. I sat at a large wood table in the window overlooking the cool patio and notice the other room had a large bar a bunch of high top tables that seemed to seat six. This was not what I expected when he said \"pizza joint\" it's way beyond that and very pleasant and open and light.  The menu was simple, a lot of great pizzas, half a dozen fancy salads, some sandwiches and about half a dozen app choices. They also had a good one page wine list that will be expanded and a COCKTAIL MENU AND FULL BAR!!!! Another rarity, FYI restaurant guys, beer and wine does not cut it for everyone. My buddy came in and was cheerfully pointed to me and when he sat down I could tell he was surprised as well, \"This place looks pretty f*cking cool\", were his exact words. I agreed and we ordered the Calamari appetizer, (had some specific name I don't remember) and I had a grilled chicken salad with tomatoes, blue cheese and candied walnuts and he had a sausage pizza with arugula and fresh sage, I think. All the food was great, I had the small salad and he had the small pizza and they were both well sized, we are both 6 foot and 200+ pounds and we were full. Eric came over and introduced himself and told us a little about the pace, his family's other restaurant (Nello's) and that they had only been open four days! For a brand new place they were doing great and if they maintain the service, food and great attitude I saw today it will be a once a week place for me. It's nice clean, casual but hip, would be a good place for a date or just lunch with a friend and brings a nice touch of a personal place to the Camelback corridor. Check it out and take a friend!",

On my first stop in I tried the \"Forager\" which was right up my alley - wild boar meatballs, rabbit sausage, fennel, and more!  My boyfriend got the \"Mare\" - a medley of seafood with some sort of creamy fish sauce under the cheese.  I thought this selection was overly fishy, but the boyfriend said he loved it.

I had attempted to call ahead to make a reservation but was dismayed to hear that they did not accept reservations. Knowing it was a Friday, and it was a first Friday, and early December... there would be a wait. So, I made sure to show up at The Parlor to secure a table or at least get my name on the list for my party of ten. I know the parking lot of The Parlor is quite small for a restaurant of its size so I wasn't surprised they would have a valet service like LGO, and knowing it was complimentary was worth it making parking less of a hassle. Placed my name on the list and was told it would be an hr wait for a table.   Despite the confusion of names, and hosts trying to locate patrons, my party was seated a little past the hour wait. Family was impressed by the place and I kept on raving about the food. We ordered the soup of the day, a bruschetta, the cauliflower granita and the frito misto. The soup of the day was this roasted sweet corn bisque that was exquisite, the bruschetta was delicious, never got to try the cauliflower granita but heard it was really good, and the frito misto was above average. As for entrees, our server was awesome in getting all our orders right. We ordered, the funghi, the salsiccia, the pepperoni, and the yukon gold potato, the duck club, the summer corn risotto and the seafood linguini. If I were to rank the pizzas in descending preference from excellent to good because none are bad... they're all yum. On top is the salsiccia, the funghi, the pepperoni and the yukon. The summer corn risotto was my least favorite, it was quite bland. The seafood linguini had a spicy kick to it which surprised us all but the pasta was delicious! And the duck club is like the best club out there, the duck is delicious, and oh so tender!   We had asked our server if the Parlor did anything special for birthday celebrations and was told, that a complimentary slice of the italian chocolate cake was given complete with candles. So knowing we'd all get a taste of the chocolate cake, we also ordered the tiramisu. We were all surprised that it was not just a slice but a freaking big slice to say the least and that chocolate cake is DELICIOSO!!! Topped with fresh whip, and lots of whip, and the chocolate was so moist, not too sweet and inside it had black cherries... just thinking of it makes me want to stop by later for a slice... it's GOOD!!! and the Tiramisu has to be one of the best tiramisu's i've had, just as good as the one back in North Beach in Little Italy SF. The pine nut topping was bomb it was a boom boom pow with the tastebuds! Both desserts were a great finish to a very satisfying meal, and it seems my family will return in the future. Can't wait for my return visit soon!",

The atmosphere was cool, the pizza was tasty, and decently priced, and the 2 pitchers of Amber Beer I had consumed were also excellent. 2 stars for that.. But man, this guy suuuuuuuuuuuuucked. Totally rude, I don't recall ever hearing him say hello or smiling once. Apparently it was a major nuisance waiting on us & having the ability to properly count money... I was relieved when his bar-back showed up though, he was cool. 1 star to him.

The more I think about it, the more I am sure this is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix!  The second and third time I visited the Parlor I discovered that I could create my own pizza!  Sweet!  One time the husband and I split a twelve inch and added ricotta, schreiner's parlor blend sausage, wild mushrooms, and oregano.  It was a magnificent pizza and we even had leftover!  Of course we did get the eggplant bruschetta to start.  The last time I was there, just the other day in fact, I decided to get the small 8 inch pizza for myself.  This time I added ricotta, house-made mozzarella, schreiner's parlor blend sausage, and applewood smoked bacon.  OMG!  It was so good and the bacon was the best possible thing I could have added.  It was delicious and WAY more food than one person can eat on their own.  It was more like a medium sized pizza you can get at any of the pizza chains, but much, much tastier!  I also checked out the bathrooms this time and they are super cute with subway tiling and some great artwork.  I LOVED the vintage pictures of the restaurant when it was actually a parlor.  Great stuff!  In case you were wondering, I'm officially addicted to The Parlor.",

I'm all for valet, but when \"valet\" means moving my car 10 feet next to other cars that self-parked, that's a bit pretentious.  So, apparently is the whole restaurant.  Don't get me wrong... not pretentious in a tuxedo-wearing-waiter sort of way.  No, this is Arizona pretentious... overpriced dishes, mediocre quality, smallish portions, and staff that can't wait to jump out of their shells to tell you how their food is \"made with love\" and every other BS line they have.  When the owner came by the say hello, he started with \"hey, man, I'm Erik and this is my place\". \"My place\"? What, is this his living room?  If I'm buying a $19 salad with chicken, I don't want to be called \"man\" and greeted by shaky-wristed guys wearing graphic T-shirts delivering my salad (\"you did order the salad, right sir?\", before setting it down).  If you like the Vig or any of the other pseudo-pretentious \"hot spots\" that populate Phoenix these days, maybe this is your place.  The atmosphere is nice from a decor standpoint, although I know that anyplace decorated that way is d-bag central.  I'm all for nice service but not fake nice.  Read my other reviews and you'll see I'm not into \"the scene\".  My psychoanalysis on The Parlor, other than the food is very average and even a bit bland, is that it's the place soulless people go to convince themselves they're not soulless because they had a conversation with their waiter about hair pom and told the lifeless, dull-as-dishwater hostess they bought their girlfriend the same pair of jeans.  For $19, I'll get a salad at the Phoenician and actually have a conversation with the young server about world travels.  If The Parlor didn't have seven waiters all serving you different parts of your dinner so that you could have such a conversation, I doubt the paper-thin likability would last long.",

The four of us girls ordered a large Caesar salad to start and split that and two large pizzas.   The salad was good.  Perfectly tossed with the right amount of dressing.   We ordered the pepperoni pizza, the basil made it delicious!  And the spicy BBQ pizza which was yummy also!  Generous on the chunks of chicken!

Such was the experience at The Parlor this Valentine's Day. Peg and I literally called the restaurant from 4 minutes away and were invited to come in...there were two empty tables. We were fortunate to have one available after a 2 minute wait, and were seated at an out of the way quiet place to enjoy the evening and each other. I had the Bestia Tutta (sp) (Whole Animal) special (primi through dessert) and Peg had the fritto misto, farm green salad (smaller portion) and a pasta carbonera which was insanely good. From the first course of my \"all pork, all the time\" dinner, things were just incredbile. Paul made the journey wonderful and his service was stellar. A friend (Dusty) who we met yearssssssssss ago at The Painted Horse has been working The Parlor for 2 1/2 years. He stopped by and said hello....he was fabulous then, and he hasn't lost a beat.  The whole experience at The Parlor was superb....and the next time we go..we may actually plan ahead...but the odds aren't really favoring that!  If you haven't tried this gem, we would highly recommend it!  Dr. B",

    "text": "I was itching to try The Parlor after reading reviews on here. I went today on my lunch break. The building is pretty sleek and the parking was limited plus it was peak lunch hour.  The inside was nicely done. Stained cement floors, a small patio, a small bar on the north side, a pizza counter in the middle, and a wine shelf in the back. The south side of the dining room has huge 10 ft glass windows with mosaic brick on the outside that let in some light from the street without grand displaying the ugly Indian School traffic. There are also a few sky lights that let in just enough light to let the day in but also keep it low key. There is also tons of wood throughout the entire restaurant that is very cool and gives off a real nice effect that makes the inside better than the other urban/modern style joints. I sat at the pizza counter that has some sweet old school barber chairs for stools. The counter is right in front of the wood fired oven and a perfect view to see other dishes and pizzas coming out of the oven and being plated.  I ordered the duck club based on recommendations I read. I asked for the jam on the side as I'm not much of a sweet guy. After about a 20 minute wait my food arrived. After seeing pictures from Joel I was disappointed. The bun was plain and not grilled as I expected. The filling of the sandwich was lacking big time. The flavors were definitely all there. The duck was cooked to perfection albeit a little on the cold side. The bacon stood out the most. It was awesome. The jam was ok nothing special and the aiolli tasted like watered down ranch. The fries were tasty. The portion of the fries was small but the flavors and texture was on point.  The service was good. The waiter checked on me a few times and gave me a couple updates that my club was almost ready and the chef was about to plate it. Unfortunately they dont take Discover (the only credit card in America that doesn't outsource their staff).  All in all it was definitely a cool looking spot with a great feel to it and nice staff. Even though I felt jipped on the portions I would give it another shot as some of those pizzas looked delicious coming out of the oven. There are quite a few places on my list so I don't know how quickly I will be back but I will give an update if its worth while.",
