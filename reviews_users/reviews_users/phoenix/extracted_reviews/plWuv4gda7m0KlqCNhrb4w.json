Couple the great food with their superb beer selection, and you've got a winning combo.  I can vouch for their burgers, fries, house-made pop tarts, and the \"Nutter\" sandwich (get it with marshmallow fluff too!). Those are all sure-bet items, and some of the tastiest things that exist in the Valley. *These may in fact be my favorite french fries around now too. Top notch.  The only thing wrong with ATAH is that it needs a bug lamp or two. There are way too many flies buzzing around.",

Ended up here on my third stop from places near by, that weren't quite what I was looking for. After searching Yelp reviews this was my final stop. I'm a burger connoisseur and had the Brewlee with smoked pork burger. Excellent!! I grabbed their homemade pop tart of the day which is some sort of banana cinnamon vanilla - I didn't even pay attention until I got back to my room and it's still warm... And delicious. Yum!! Leaving PHX AZ satisfied with a good find!",

Sizable back area, with heaters to keep the temperature just right. They also have an area for your dog, if you bring them along. Beer selection is rather extensive, food is great! Sampled a friend's pizza which, albeit was on the greasy side, was still delectable. The pouting was tasty, although the gravy could have used a bit less salt. Overall, would love to head back here again, maybe during the Summer..",

Some kitchy offerings (spam sliders), and some good old standards.  I decided on their grilled cheese w/ fries. And it was awesome. Not too greasy, and not too cheesy. Yes, that's a thing.  I was told by the patron next to me that I had made a huge error in not ordering the tots, but to each his own. This place has become quite the trendy, sought after spot.

The only downside is that the food does take a while to come out, which sucks if you're hungry when you show up. On the other hand, I guess it's worth it for good food.   The atmosphere is loud, boisterous and fun. It seems to always be extremely crowded. But I've never seen anything outrageously awful happen so it's a pretty good place to be.   I am sure we will eat here many more times this year!",

They have a bunch of different craft beers on tap which may be overwhelming to some but their staff is very knowledgable and willing to help you find a beer you may like. My favorite thing to do is get a flight of beer. You can choose up to 6 different beers in your flight which are about 3oz servings.   The food has never disappointed me. I went recently for happy hour with some friends and a couple of us were able to split one of their flatbreads for only $7. Their food is bar food turned up a notch.  Some favorites: pretzels, poutine, and their \"Nutter\" sandwich add peppered bacon!  Tip: grab a beer and go outside on the patio to play some cornhole (bean bag toss for those who may not know what cornhole is). Definitely a great place to go with some friends!",

He said it was very flavorful the bacon was crispy, the green leaf lettuce was just a great combination for this juicy burger. I liked my Sammy - it was different, not bad simply good. The adobo sauce was good but I don't know maybe it was too smoky for my taste buds. My toddler had the cheese pizza. I have to say none of us liked the dipping sauce - tasted more like marinara sauce. we would have preferred ketchup, but regardless it didn't take away from this place or food.

I don't think I need to flag down a server to either order or pay my bill-that seems counterintuitive to their existence as a restaurant with wait staff. I don't think that I've ever had a greatly outgoing server there. I always feel like I am bothering them.   The food is good. Poutine is good.   There's plenty of other places to go around there.

However, yesterday I visited there with a friend who has been a long time,very regular customer of theirs and this time the service was not up to par. We had a dog with us and so we were on the patio sitting in the chairs at the edge of the patio and no one came to take our order or even say hello! There were three other tables on the patio when we came in and as we sat there one left,  it was a very slow time of day . The two servers on the patio  kept looking at us but they never came over finally my friend got their attention and the young man said oh sorry, I'll get your order but just so you know we don't normally wait on people when they're sitting here normally you would go to the bar and I asked him how I would do that since I had a dog and the bar is inside. He didn't answer. My friend went inside and just ordered from the bartender and bypassed the waiter. If they have a rule that certain seating on the patio is only for patrons who order at the bar there should be some kind of sign there because we had no idea that was how we were supposed to order. It's a dog-friendly patio so this doesn't seem to mesh. By the way the bartender gave us excellent service!",

It stands right next to an empty-open-dirt lot right across from the Film Bar. Once I got in, I immediately like the open-flow of the place because it carries from inside to outside effortlessly. The layout is quite laid back and they even have lounge chairs outside for some real relaxation. I also thought that the blackboard listing all their drinks had a nice eccentric effect to it.    We went on a Friday late afternoon and the place was semi-full but completely full two hours later.  I enjoyed the Farm flat bread pizza topped with delicious veggies.  I loved every bite even though I'm not a vegetarian.  My two friends each enjoyed the Flight which is a muffin tray that holds six small glasses of different beers of your choice.  I was too hungry so I didn't go for that.  But if you go there on a full stomach, it's a great choice if you want to try almost all the drinks.",

My second time was in the summer, I stopped in for some beers during art walk and I ordered the poutine again.  I was so thoroughly surprised about how much the dish improved.  It was absolutely fantastic and was even better than home (they put green onions on top which were a great addition).    The most recent trip was for lunch during the weekend.  We stopped by for lunch before hitting up a matinee at the Film Bar that is right across the street.  The patio was a great way to enjoy the weather and drink a couple beers.  I ordered a burger with an egg on top.  I was never so impressed with the presentation of the burger.  The bun had a since shine to it.  It came with a huge side of fries that are very good.  Because of these more recent experiences and the quality of the food, I have increased my rating.",

It wasn't too much of a problem though (except we were hungry) since we didn't need to be anywhere else afterwards. Once the order was taken we got our food within another fifteen minutes. The service was decent but has been better.  The atmosphere is amazing, like always. I'll definitely be back and continue to recommend this place to friends.",

    "text": "I have heard about this place since I moved out here in October of 09', I decided enough was enough....it was time !   It's so tucked away downtown I actually drove past it.  It was about 9PM on a Wed. and inside all tables were packed.  The patio was actually great and I like that they have all drinks written on a chalkboard as opposed to using just menus. I had a red blend of wine which was really yummy, similar to a Cabernet.   The only thing I wasn't that thrilled about was their food selection.  I'm not sure why, but nothing really caught my eye.  We ordered \"the mess\" and shared between the three of us.  Brown gravy, cheese curds and fries.  They were pretty good, but I thought the gravy left little to be desired.    The thing that would keep me coming back would have to be the mellow vibe and man, I loved that patio.  I will eat before and be happy to quench my thirst on a flight of beers. :)  Want something low key, but a great atmosphere...this is it.",

They have a large chalkboard with a never ending list of craft beers to choose from..and wine..on tap!  I've had the spud taco, veggie flatbread pizza and avocado salad.  I would stick to the pizza and salad.  The spud taco was a little greasy for my taste.  Nice, sized portions.  I would suggest getting here early to beat the crowds to a table.",

Pictures of the food left us eager to try a few items too.  We got there early to beat the crowds and were promptly seated.  After a few questions and some pondering we both ordered our beers.  They came out quickly.  I enjoyed the selections, something for every type of beer connoisseur.  Service was very good and we were never left sitting.  Our waitress was very personable.  We both got entrees, a brisket sandwich which was OK (not a lot of flavor), and a burger.  I was disappointed because the burger looked to be a frozen hockey puck type.  Definitely formed by something besides hands.  I was expecting a more handmade type thing at a place with this much gusto.  Still tasted good though.  Fries were also very tasty.  We also splurged on the homemade pop-tarts.  They were awesome!  Highly recommended!  Overall, we will return for sure, just maybe not right away.",

    "text": "I like Angels Trumpet Ale House, I really do, but some of their business practices are a little shady.  To be fair, I am writing this review after my third visit within two weeks.  This last time I left unhappy.  I wont throw them completely under the bus though, so I'll start with the good.  The food and ale!   My favorite thing on the menu are the wings, served crispy and naked, sauce on the side.  These wings are delicious!  I always order my wings crispy with little to no sauce, so these are a sure thing for me.   I have also had the grilled cheese made with smoked mozzarella and fontina, honey drizzle, tomato and much more.  Delicious!   Be sure to ask for a smaller size of \"the mess\" appetizer, as your side.  The Mess is their version of poutine.  Really good!  I gave the sausage platter a try this last time, not my favorite.  It was good enough, but didn't blow me away.  Sausage quality is just okay.  I wouldn't order it again.    Moving on to the service...its hit or miss.  Great service once out of three visits?  Disappointing.  The other night was terrible and the server was either really dumb or just plain rude.  One person in my party ordered the avocado salad, which she has had several times prior.  Right away she said this time it doesn't taste right.  She gave it a shot, but it just wasn't right,  so she called the server over to let him know.  He said \"I'll let the manager know\".  He returned and said he could take 50% off for the salad. Really?  50%?  My friend immediately said no and the server stomped off and said \"I'll send her out.\" The manager came out and said \"I never said I would take only 50% off.\"  So...Was our server just trying to pull a fast one on us?  At the end of the salad ordeal, the manager was nice and there was no charge.  However, it was the most awkward experience I have ever witnessed over sending something back.    Now for the bill. Our server said he was going home and did we mind if he brought the checks?  I have no problem with this whatsoever in any restaurant.  He did the work, he should get the tip and not the person he passes the table to.  We were a party of 5, this joker added gratuity to all of our checks.  For a party of 5, really?  He didn't even say anything and I would barely have noticed the way it was slipped in on the check.  I normally don't have a problem with auto gratuity for large parties, but I do for a party of 5.  This guy is a scammer and he ended up shorting himself anyway as we would have tipped more on our own.   I should also point out that Angels Trumpet has no auto gratuity policy as this didn't happen with my party of 12 just a few nights prior.    All in all, I recommend Angels Trumpet Ale House.  Food and drinks are great.  Just beware of shady service and double check your bill!  Enjoy!",

It has a bright, sunny, open feel in the daytime and becomes more intimate at nighttime, Either way, it feels like Im at someone's 1960's home but with a modern twist (seems weird to say but thats how I interpret it.)  I tried some of my friends avocado salad and thought it was pretty good for being basic, The flatbreads on the other hand could have been better. The bread that had toppings got soggy real quick. The cheese felt like food truck quality grade, nothing real stood out flavor wise except the grease from the meats and cheese, and the brussel sprouts were undercooked. I was still able to eat it but I dont have the fondest memories of eating it.  Even though the flatbreads arent that good, the beers and atmosphere win me over that much. Although hesistant to eat anything big from here, the beer should be the focus.",

I love the atmosphere and both the indoor and outdoor seating. We've been lucky a couple of times and have sat at the half in/half out tables, and those are great :) the service is always amazing too, we've never had a long wait for anything.   Their Outlaw burger is one of the best BBQ burgers that I've had, and I've had a lot. The only thing I haven't liked that much so far is their salad, but I definitely want to try more things on the menu! My boyfriend likes the wings a lot and my sister has told me that the Bug Guppy fish tacos and margarita pizza (might only be on the happy hour menu) are amazing.   The parking lot is super small so it's hard to get a space at night, but there are tons of metered spots nearby! It's definitely worth the walk over. If you come here for dinner or drinks, definitely go across the street and check out Cobra Arcade! :)",

Big portion so the three of us couldnt even finish it!   My girlfriend got the flight of beers and said its a great option to try some of all the different kinds they had.   We also had the fish tacos, the tractor flatbread, and the chet burrito. We were raving about everything!    We also got thw rum mango poptarts and holy crap it was heaven in a pastry. 10/10 would recommend   Service was a little slow, but it was a busy dinner time so its understandable, I think its a great place to take friends or grab dinner",

The green chairs outback kinda gave me a cafeteria feel! Prices are pretty good we ordered the pretzels which came out warm and soft (ask for extra cheese Bc the one it comes with won't be enough).  Also ordered the wings crispy and tasty! For the main dish we got the outlaw burgers cooked perfect nice and moist and the bun wasn't soggy was just missing something? Little lack luster is the taste dept, the fries it comes with are crunchy and perfect giving me five guy fry vibes! The side sauce its served with tasted like spaghetti sauce, I'd pass on that  next time! Overall cute spot will defiantly be back to see what other beers they rotate in on top!",

It has a cool vibe inside, albeit a little loud for conversations to be held at times (I work in a auto shop so I'm kind of deaf). It was pretty busy on a Sunday early afternoon, which we kind of expected, and we had to park at a meter down the street which wasn't a big deal. We sat ourselves at a high top and waited for several minutes to be greeted by our server. I did not really care for the stools, as they were kind of uncomfortable, but that's not a huge gripe. After looking through some of the Yelp reviews we had found a couple things that we wanted to try, including the Spud taquitos and the wings. Neither disappointed at all. I did manage to struggle finding a beer that I really wanted which was surprising considering the fact that there was 31 choices. The first beer I ordered the keg blew and they erased it from the board. I was ok with the second choice, but should have stuck with my typical IPA. I ordered a fried chicken sandwich called the Outlaw and my fiancee ordered the fish tacos and both were very good. Our only minor gripes was the slowish service and the uncomfortable stools, but those are so minor that we will definitely be back.",

I had a Bundaberg ginger beer. Yum. Haven't had one since Australia. Kind staff.   3 non gender bathroom stalls. The music was decent for us old folks.  Billboard top 10 of 1984.

Very attentive server, even though she was hopping through a lot of tables. We ordered the mess (a poutine of sorts) and the fun guy, a mushroom and veggie pizza. Both were seriously lacking any zip, just like the 2 stars, meh. I don't think the chef used any salt or other spices from the taste of them. Would we come here again?

I'm learning just because there's a crowd doesn't guarantee good eats.

Pita bread was most def. store-bought. My husband's burgers were unseasoned and bland. When that man doesn't finish sliders something is very wrong..  Beers were crisp and cold and fun to order on a flight sheet with tons of flavors and brands I never heard of. Lighting was way too bright, I felt like I was an ant in the sun under a magnifying glass, not very complimentary on people's faces.

Long bar and lots of tables for dates or groups of friends to gather at. A neat place to begin your night at for sure, not the most popping place but perfect to grab a beer BEFORE heading to a concert, event or bar crawl. Would recommend t check thus place out, right across the street from Film bar and Cobra Arcade if you are looking for a fun night.",

I came here specifically for the grill cheese that was featured on this Top 50 list. Cheese, cheese, cheese all day long I could eat this product...in so many forms. My arteries would not like it but my palette can't get enough. But it did get just enough of the grill cheese on sourdough with several cheeses--not the standard cheddar either. It was tasty but nothing I'm over the moon about. A TON O' BEER on tap, so much local brew adds to the hipness of this place. The ambience reminds me of the food court at IKEA. This restaurant has potential to be something...better.",

Probably the best rotating selection in the Valley--you never know what you will find. With this much variety, your best option is to go for the sampler If you like bier--very cost effective with 6 samples for $9. This is one of those pubs that you need to plan ahead and bring a DD with you, because with the ample array of high alcohol biers, you can find yourself \"over the limit\" quickly. The food is good, and the servers were enthusiastic and knowledgeable about both the drink and food options. Of the bier absorbing fare, my choice is the spud tacos, filled with sweet potato, corn and Chihuahua cheese.",

    "text": "I was meeting a pretty big group last night, and when we got there they were waiting to add another table so we could sit down. We figured it would be about 20 minutes so we sat at the bar for our first drink. A couple was leaving so we took their seats (their empty glasses in front of us...EMPTY). The bartenders waled by us and it was impossible to get their attention. When they did finally come over to us it was to talk over our heads to two customers waiting for drinks! We were finally able to make contact, at which point the bar tender pointed to the EMPTY glasses and just said \"oh, those aren't yours.\" OK, even if they HAD been ours they were empty! You should ask if we need anything else.  SO we had our $8.00 drink then made our way over to join our friends. Someone mentioned a menu was coming...never happened. The waiter saw us, but we couldn't get his attention long enough to ask for anything. Now at this point, I didn't WANT to give them my money for their overpriced beer and mediocre food. I did finally get the waiter's attention long enough to ask for water as he refilled everyone else's water glasses. He still didn't ask my friend and me if we wanted food or any drinks. They were pretty neglectful of our table in general - the number of empty glasses and the lack of attention to refilling said glasses was crazy! Everyone had to track down the server in order to get their bills (except my friend and me since we had zero service = zero dollars!). It was such awful service that I ended up using their patio simply to catch up with friends (that was nice) and drink their water. I didn't spend one more dime at their establishment after that first drink at the bar, which is crazy considering I went their with every intention of having at least 2 drinks and food. I will NOT come back here - My desire to spend that much money on drinks is approx. zero if the experience is THAT bad.",

We were fortunate to get seated right away -- bustling and energetic on a Wednesday night. Friendly, attentive service. The chalkboard can be overwhelming, and our server tried to steer us in the direction of samplers, but my out-of-town buddy & I decided on a funky IPA for me and a local red ale for him. Excellent. Food is pretty much upscale bar food, and done well. Started with a plate of hot soft pretzels -- 4 crispy/soft/salty mini-loaves that hit the spot. On to a stoudt and a pale ale. I had a super grilled chicken sandwich on a fresh roll with bacon, BBQ sauce and fried onion strings. Loved it. His steak sandwich was just as good. One final porter for him and a water for me (I'm driving) and that was it.  We need more places like this in Phoenix.",

The beer list was amazing and, props for using correct glassware for each beer. The reason for the 3 stars was the food. We started out with the chicken wings. I always use these as a barometer for a place that calls itself an ale house. They were served hot, but dry. Three accompanying sauces were served (Ranch?/Some sort of light cinnamon flavored/  and a Tabasco-like spicy one). Unfortunately all 3 sauces failed. Please don't try and re invent the wheel and  don't try and fancy-up wings. Would never order these again. We then split the roasted beet and arugula salad. The roasted beets were fabulous and just the right amount of crumbles. We did not particularly care for the metal plate the salad was served on, as both of us kept getting that metal on metal scrapping feeling when we dug into it. The service was friendly and prompt, our waitress was helpful, although had no idea what we were talking about when we asked about sour ales. I asked because an article had mentioned that it was a favorite of one of the owners. We would go back for a few beers, maybe try something else small off the menu, but at this point I would be hesitant to order a full meal or bring a bunch of people in to eat.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place.  I was in with a friend a few months ago and we had a great bartender and I had a couple of beers but we didn't have any food.  This time I came back with family and and we had food.  This place suffers from the more is better and more bacon is even better mentality that is in vogue with those that don't understand balance.  The meat pizza was good but over topped which made the crust go soft and bacon dominated all of the meats.  My wife had the summer berry salad special.  She liked it but said the dressing was too oily and didn't have enough vinegar.    I had the Garfield which is a turkey wrap with bacon and cranberry aioli.  The only flavor was bacon.  I really missed the cranberry flavor.  A simpler version done at SunUp is much more balanced.  The beer selection was skewed bizarrely to +7% ABV beers.  There were only a couple of \"sessionable\" beers available.  The ESB I tried was flat and tasted more like a brown.    The house ketchup it terrible - it isn't sweetened and tasted like canned tomato paste.  It is bitter and sour and really ruined the decent fries that came with my sandwich.  If the place could lose some illusions and pull back a bit it could be a great spot.  Oh, the place only had a few tables of people and noise level was horrible, maybe that is why the waitress missed my iced tea order, although the staff seemed to have no problem talking to each other for long stretches.  Given the spotty service and the fact that one of our glasses was dirty and my daughters soda had something floating in it, I won't be quick to come back.  My wife commented that the bathrooms and the dining area were very clean.",

Find a beer you like the sound of, or the style, tell the server the number. Easy 2. \"The colours of the chalk hurt my eyes\" - really? get some glasses. 3. \"It closes too early\" - come earlier 4. \"It's too busy\" - come later 5. \"I don't like craft beer\" - don't come at all 6. \"I have to share my table, eeew\" - unless you are paying their bill, what's yer problem? make some new friends. 7. \"It's too loud\" - It's a bar, it's supposed to be loud 8. \"the parking lot is too small\" - be thankful that there is a (free) parking lot. There is always street parking or you could ride a bike. 9. \"there's not enough bike parking\" - chain it to a lamppost. 10. \"The beers keep running out\" - it is a rotating selection, they are not running out, they are changing. 11 & 12 \"The beers are too expensive\" - \"Where is the Coors/Bud/Miller?\" - I give up.  The fact that this bar is so unique is probably why so many people are confused and write dumbass reviews. It takes them out of their comfort zone. It is for this very reason that I am giving it 5 stars. Most places are exactly the same as everywhere else and kudos to Angel's Trumpet for daring to be different.  I love the beer selection, I love that I haven't heard of most of them. I also love the food. The onion and blue cheese quesadilla was amazing. The bison BLT in a blanket was a knockout and the avocado salad made my vegetarian girlfriend very happy. The service has been good all 3 visits.  What really blew my mind during the last visit was the quality of the music. When a bar plays The Jam, Madness, The Specials, The Clash, Talking Heads, Depeche Mode, The Police, The Beat, I know there is someone in charge (even if only in charge of the music) with good taste.  One suggestion - the chalkboard on the patio should be raised. It's too low when people sit at the table right next to it and difficult to read. Other than that one, very minor inconvenience, this place is unique and it rocks. I will be back for sure.",

You never know what cold micro brews will be available sourced across the globe - from day to day and from hour to hour. A keg finishes, they hook up a new keg and change the chalkboard listing. Always a surprise - a delightful, delicious surprise.  And the pub grub - best I've ever had anywhere. Full of surprises from a chef bursting with ideas. Fried egg to top off a flatbread pizza, pecan pie pop tarts, wild game sausage with condiments made in house daily ... perfect complements to the delicious offerings on tap.  Downtown might need to be a place to live - people might not want to drive home after sampling the riches on the streets down here!",

    "text": "I love this place.  I go to a lot of places.  Some try to be too ambitious and fall on the face with their overly-complicated menus. Some try to take things down to a more simple idea and end up overshooting, making everything bland and too usual.  Angel Trumpet has no such flaws.  They're also not perfect, but I can justify that 5-star review.    Let's get it out of the way:  The chairs suck, they're kind of uncomfortable and rigid.  The beer prices are kind of what we like to call \"astronomical\" for a mostly poor beanly-fellow such as myself.  The food can come out a little slow.  It's all True, if someone else said it in another review, I can back that all up.  And yet, I don't really give a damn.  This is a local joint in downtown Phoenix peddling 31 different beers that are always rotating.  Not a \"regular\" beer in sight.  It's what downtown Phoenix has been clamoring for.  And if you're coming to an ale house, you're coming to drink first and eat later.  Still, I like their food.  Stroganoff burger...oh man.  I'm such a sour cream whore and, I love my food saucy and wet but I hate soggy stuff.  The bun stood up to the stroganoff sauce and the sour cream and the mushrooms and the juicy medium-cooked beef perfectly.  The 810 sandwich with hand-pulled turkey works in spite of the overly-southwestern theme (pull back on the adobo a bit, it can taste like the restaurant equivalent of \"taco seasoning\" that every white person I know uses to make tacos) because each of the ingredients is high-quality.  The bread is fresh and crisped.  The ribbon chips are amazingly thin.  People have griped and complained for literally decades that downtown doesn't have any neat, laid-back places to have a beer and be a human, with most places downtown still ready to serve the post-5pm cattle herd and nothing more.  Here you have a genuine Phoenix experience.  Don't gripe too much.  Soak it up.    We'll will be back there.  Will you?",

    "text": "I have visited this place on quite a few occasions, none have been fantastic yet I have come back. Tonight has ruined it forever for me. The manager made a mistake and took no responsibility for it, and blamed her staff.  A few friends met for a birthday get together we drank we ate and we payed our tabs and tipped well. After we had payed our tab before we had started our last drinks, since our server wanted to go home on time. One sip in my friend, who brews beer and is very knowledgable, realized it was not what he had expected from the waitresses description. Since we all work in the service industry my friend was hesitant to even bring up the issue. We convinced him to just ask, which he expected to hear a blatant no because the beer is expensive. He asked and the waitress stated \"Unfortunately we can't resell that beer... but we can get you something else but I will ask that you taste it first.\" Which we understood as we could replace the beer they didn't like with one that he definitely did for no cost. Especially since, without any indication she removed the previous drink from the table. The waitress walked away while rolling her eyes.  After the beer came a check came shortly after. We explained to a different waiter the situation and his response was \"It's only $6.50\". My friend explained that had he known he would be paying for the beer he would not have ordered it but that the last waitress had given the impression that this beer would not be charged. We paid the $6.50. My friend honestly did not want a discount, free food. All he wanted was recognition that a mistake was made and to hopefully prevent this from happening again.  I am currently sitting and listening to the manager (the same waitress that \"explained the policy to us initially\") blame our original waitress for her mistake. \"I can't just say no it's our policy that we don't take any beers back.\" But if you can't say that and you can't take the beer back then you just leave customers confused. She is taking no responsibility for the fact that she caused the entire situation. The drink policy is on the food menu, which if you are sitting and drinking for hours like we were is not visible when ordering drinks.   Train your managers how to speak to customers.",

I really want to love this place as it's in my neighborhood and I enjoy findingobscure craft and micro brews, but the service is a little slow, they're not knowledgeable about the beers they offer, and the inside space is VERY loud.    The design of the space/building is great.  Great view of the downtown skyline.  But I really wish they didn't build that shade structure that looks so temporary and which draws your attention away from all the other great design elements.  I haven't tried more than 3-4 items on the food menu, so I'm not going to review the food.  What I had seem to be a bit experimental, and was good, but nothing memorable.  With a few adjustments, I think this place will be a great downtown spot.",

Pros: +nice and relaxing feel, inside and outside seating +there's a beer sampler you can get so taste multiple beers for 10$ +the food is delicious!   Spam slider was a unique twist on using spam. The chicken quesadilla was also amazing! Love the pickled onions on there. It was part of the seasonal menu too so not sure if they serve this all the time.   We wanted to try dessert because we heard it was good but the flavor of tart they had that day did not sound appetizing so we passed.   Cons: - can't think of any",

The chalkboard with all the different beers they had is cool. The crowd seemed older (at that time) and was just hanging out. Our waiter, however, seemed kind of all over the place. We didn't see him much after our food order was taken; we had to wave him down because we didn't get two items and the table was more than halfway done with the food. He said later on that the kitchen or runner staff was new?? So I'm not sure who's \"fault\" it was. He tried to fix it by comping the app and giving a 50% discount on the entree. I guess at that point, what else could he do?   The food: it was ok. The burger wasn't anything special. My fish tacos were good, and I was thought the portion (2 pieces of fish per taco) was a generous ratio. But I didn't care for the fries, which appeared to be poutine - good thing they were free right, ha! The fries tasted kinda burnt, overdone...and that ruined it for me.   The beer: good things throughout the table.   Overall, maybe a place for beer and not a meal.",

Liked that it came with cucumbers.  We also had the chips/salsa/bean dip.  The chips were ok.  I generally like thick chips, but many of the chips were soft, which I'm not a fan of.  The salsa was spicy and the bean dip was savory.  I liked it.  For my main, I had the BBQ salad with brisket.  Great flavor and textures.  Just the right amount of lettuce, with lots of vegetables.  The brisket was fine, but the BBQ sauce combined with the dressing provided a nice punch.  Service was a little slow, but I don't think they staff up for lunch.  Seems like more of a pre-entertainment place to go during the evenings.  I liked the space.  Roomy with a hipster vibe.",

It was packed out, but we were able to get seats at one of the shared high-top tables, which is always fun since you never know who you'll end up chatting with.  If you're on a date and looking for exclusivity, it's probably not ideal, but it's always entertaining to start chatting with your fellow diners about whether they would recommend the food they're currently shoveling down their throats in an attempt to escape your rowdiness.  There's a killer beer selection and a surprisingly good couple of wines as well.  We also devoured a set of wings (highly recommend) and the tractor pizza (eggs, bacon, brussel sprouts - weird but tasty).  We could have split a single dish, since the pizza ended up being much bigger than we expected, but we just pigged out instead.  We also tried some of the homemade poptart of the day, which sounds weird and a little gross (if you remember what poptarts usually taste like) but which was actually an incredible dessert.  Definitely recommend Angels Trumpet as a chill place to meet up for a beer or two.",

I, however, am not much of a beer drinker so I went with their Pinot Grigio on tap! It was light and refreshing! To start, we all split the pretzels. Oh man, they were hot and delish. They were served with mustard and a beer cheese sauce. For my entree, I got the 810 sammy but swapped the bread for a wrap. It had shaved *smoked* turkey, peppered bacon, avocado mash, pickled red onions, and adobo sauce with pickled jalapenos on the side. I love that they give you the option to have it in a wrap (on request only). It made it a lot lighter! I would for sure order it again.  All in all, this is a fun, trendy spot in Downtown Phoenix to come with friends, coworkers, family, you name it! They have something for everyone, and DEFINITELY will please all of the beer lovers in your group!",

The fried chicken sandwich was a little dry but seasoned and crispy. The burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were better than any other gastropub's that I've had. The beer selection was great and I loved how open the venue was. Price was good too.",

The wings were good.  I enjoyed that they were naked and you could dip them in a choice of two sauces.  The sauces were okay.",

    "text": "My fiance was in the mood for beer & a burger so I started my Yelp search. I've had Angel's Trumpet House bookmarked for a while now, so when that came up, we immediately thought to try it out. They have a very small parking lot in the back, it was full when we arrived but we were able to get metered parking right across the street. There was sign at the door saying to grab a menu & seat yourself, so we did. We really wanted a table outside to enjoy the beautiful AZ weather & were able to grab the last one right as we walked outside.  We got a flight of beer to start off with. The only one I really wanted to try out was the Apricot Cider, my fiance ordered the rest. He got the Breakside Stout, Daily Wages, Dragonhosen, Fruitwood, Brown Shugga. The Breakside Stout was his favorite, followed by Fruitwood, then Brown Shugga.  I had seen some really impressive photos on Yelp of the fish tacos so I decided to get the Big Guppy for my meal & my fiance got the Outlaw Burger with a tomato & french fries.  My meal was very colorful! The fish looked perfectly fried with a bright secret sauce (as listed on the menu) & corn relish on top, pico de gallo & avocado mash on the side along with refried beans & spicy coleslaw. Everything tasted absolutely delicious! The sauce on top of the fish had a bit of heat to it, the pico added a bit of acidity, & the avocado mash was really creamy and added a cooling effect. The refried beans also had good flavor & a bit of heat, but the spicy slaw didn't have much flavor. That was probably the only disappointment, however I would definitely get this dish again!  My fiance really enjoyed his burger. He's not a huge fan of BBQ sauce on a burger, but he said this burger tasted good. I only tried a bite, which tasted really peppery, but the tomato he asked to be added made the whole thing. I did snag quite a few of his french fries. They came with a side of tomato sauce which was interesting! It seemed like their substitute for ketchup.  Overall, the atmosphere was good, the beer was good, & the food was really good so 5 stars! They have some specials, & we'll be going back soon to try out their TV dinners on a Tuesday.",

We also shared a the Tractor Pizza - two farm eggs*, bacon, brussels sprouts, caramelized onions, pecorino romano, smoked mozzarella, roasted tomato sauce. The beers were pretty good. The waitress choose all the IPAs for me as I love IPAs. The pizza was fantastic. Egg was runny and tied the pizza together pretty well.  They have an outdoor area with cornhole and plenty of seating as well. Pretty chill spot to hang when the weather permits. Overall, cool spot. Has TVs with games on. Solid beer and food.",

Since it was our first time, I chose to order \"The Flight\" which is a beer sampler. My choices were pretty good. To add to the flavors, we both decided to order the Spam Grilled Cheese Sandwich. Was to die for!!!! Who knew the taste of spam in a grilled cheese would be heavenly? Haven't had spam in decades. Will definitely be back to try some more.",

This is where it went down hill. It took 25 min before our drink order was taken, we are aware of the time as we set a timer due to using metered parking so we didn't have to worry about a ticket. The waiter was not personable at all. I ordered a cider and my husband a flight. I was half way through my cider by the time his flight arrived from the bar. At this point it had been close to 40 min and we decided we were not ordering food since it had taken so long to just get drinks. We saw many other people seated during this time and it appeared their wait staff was extremely attentive. An hour later after only seeing our waiter a total of two times (once to order drinks and once more after) we had to flag down another employee to get our check (who was extremely friendly). It was a very disappointing first visit. I would love to go back and try their TV dinner which is served on Tue, and if we attempt will probably just sit at bar. We left and had dinner elsewhere that night.",

On the food front, while the pizza I ordered was nothing amazing, it was good enough to keep from detracting from the experience, and their pop-tart albeit rich is life-changing. I will definitely be going back to try some of their other beers and hope to try some of their more highly recommended food items (i.e. their fish tacos, spam sliders) when I do.",

Both beers had great taste to them and had perfect pours.  We were actually late to the airport cause we wanted to stay.  We also ordered a pizza to hold us through our flight.  What a great idea, pizza was the Casper and it was amazing.  It had goat cheese, honey drizzle, salami, leeks, rosemary, garlic.  Salami was cooked to perfection and so was the pizza.  Atmosphere was great, a lot of people having a good time.  Outside area is nice and spacious.  They even have some corn hole sets that you can play with.  Gave it 4 stars cause after we decided to eat and sat at a table.  It took them a while to notice that we needed some service.  Parking is pretty small so bring some quarters to pay for parking.",

She then disappeared and a couple sat down right beside us and received two glasses of water, silverware, and menus before we were even visited by staff again.   The food was just ok. Which was a disappointment because the menu is very ambitious and if excecuted properly, would have had a high ceiling. I would say the wings were very good by themselves but not a huge fan of the 3 dipping sauce options. The bruless beef burger w/ egg was good but you can't really go wrong w/ a burger when cooked right. I want to give this place another try, however my poor customer service experience is really preventing me from doing so.  I was also interested in trying out some of the large selection of beers, however nobody offered or even attempted to gauge my interests of trying anything from the varieties offered. I guess I just made up my own mind, will not be going back to this place. Bummer, was really hoping for good things.",

    "text": "NEVER GO HERE! WAITED AN HOUR TO BE SERVED! SNOOTY WAITER!  So my last review, though strongly worded, was pulled down by Yelp. When I inquired why, no one responded so I am reposting this review because I value your time and money just like I do my own.  I arrived at Angel's Trumpet at 10pm to meet friends. I am always leery of new places my friends pick. They just show up without checking reviews or they listen to bad reviewers who rave about the place. Angel's Trumpet was bad except for the Beer selection which is exciting.   After ordering my first two beers at the bar the waiter showed up and asked what I wanted at 11:00pm! An hour after I got there. When I said I was starving and wanted food I was informed that the kitchen was closed. I was busy socializing with fellow medical school classmates that I have never been out with (we call it networking since these will be my colleagues) to notice the time so when the waiter (and that's what he made me do...wait) said the kitchen was closed I was shocked to see an hour went pass. I tried to order a round of shots and was told they do not have liquor. I tried to order a glass of wine and was told that they do not have wine. I tried to order a beer and was told they were closing in 15 minutes. I asked for a beer menu and was told that they do not have menus. WHAT DO YOU HAVE! I was informed that I had to go up to the bar and read the big chalk board behind the bar for the beer selection. I pointed out, if I have to go to the bar to read the beer selection then why would I bother coming back to order through you when the bartender is right there in front of me!  I grew up in the restaurant business so I know circumstances are all based on timing. I saw the four star rating this place has so clearly many people like this place and have very good experiences. Maybe it was bad timing, but for me the waiter was an HOUR LATE, THERE WAS NO MENU, AND I WAS DENIED EVERYTHING I ASKED FOR FROM THE WAITER. To make it even worse the waiter copped an attitude because he is bad at his job. I have bad mouthed this place for a month now and I will continue to bad mouth this place to everyone I meet. Having Yelp pull down my review just angers me even more and I will now post on every site I can think of in the near future.  I never saw but one waiter maybe two that night. Way too little for such a big place.   IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME AND MONEY STAY AWAY!",

My son had the buffalo dog and said it was the best hot dog he had ever had.   I'm vegetarian and didn't have trouble finding anything on the menu.   -Fun atmosphere, great decor, large patio   Minus - The brunch menu today was limited.  My son REALLY wanted a buffalo dog today - in fact, he chose the location because of it - and he was very sad that it wasn't on the menu.     Extra plus:  - Excellent service!  They made my son a buffalo dog today at brunch, even though it wasn't supposed to be available today.  We will be returning on a regular basis!",

    "text": "What a strange experience... Busy Friday night, out with a friend.   Waiter was... busy? Also inattentive until I made mention of not liking my food. His initial response to me saying I did not like my obviously un-eaten meal was, \"Ok. Well... they may not take it off the bill... The chef makes that decision...\"  Um. Ok... waited.. Then he came back to say, \"They want to know what was wrong with the meal.\" To which I gave him feedback (I had the Matador: both the meat & fries tasted unseasoned).  ... waited... Back again with, \"They said we have to charge you for half.\" At that point, I ended up asking for a manager.  ... waited... The waiter returned to inform me that, \"Because it's such a busy Friday night, the manager is trying to deal with stuff & they can't come over. But they went ahead and took the whole meal off your bill.\"  ... Ok. By then my friend had enough and went to speak to the manager himself.  My friend came back and said the manager had been very kind and understanding, agreeing that he had tasted some of the food and noticed it was a little off. He apologized for not coming over to the table, and agreed it should have been handled well. He also said he had told the waiter to let us know he was going to talk to the chefs about the quality of the food.  ... so... All the nonsense leading up to the conversation with the manager was so unnecessary. I don't know why/how/where the communication broke down, but a customer should not have to \"testify\" in detail to why they did not like their food. It was uneaten. I wasn't lying.  Unfortunately, as close to my home as this place is and as great as it had seemed going into it, I will not be returning.   It's one thing to have mediocre food OR mediocre service...  but you can't have both.",

    "text": "One of the newest places in town and it's already one of the best.  The beer selection is most impressive and the largest I have seen in Phoenix.  Some local, some independent brew and lots from Germany and Belgium.  I'm told the selection will always change a bit.  When one keg runs empty it will be replaced in back with a different selection on hand.  Expect to see some variance each visit.  The food menu boasted some interesting selections and they've made an effort to put unique selections or spins on traditional bar fare.  I tried the Spam sliders.  They were okay but that's all on me.  I learned I did not care for Spam too much.  Went for something new and wasn't too pleased but I live and learn.  I know there are items on the menu I would surely enjoy.  Service was great: quick and friendly.  To top it off, Angels Trumpet Ale House sells growlers!  Awesome.  Come in and enjoy and leave with a growler of your favorite beer.  Keep in mind the growler selection may not be open to everything on the menu.  Located across the street from FilmBar, this is in a great location and can easily be incorporated into a fun night out.    Angels Trumpet Ale House will become one of my regular haunts along with FilmBar and Revolver Records.",

    "text": "Was out and about this last Saturday with some pals of mine on a bike ride and decided to stop in.  Would have to say I have truly enjoyed ever visit I have had there (always sat at the bar).  Never had a complaint about service. This last time though we took a table outside since the weather was too nice not to take advantage of of the one table that happened to open up outside. Felt lucky considering it seemed to be pretty busy at the time.  We were greeted by our server promptly and provided with water just as quick.  we requested some sample tastings of a few brews and per usual I always appreciate their diligence in offering for us to taste our beer selections before we had them.  Than onto our food orders.  Having a full lunch just before our ride I had decided to stick to my 1 beer for the time we were there. My friends needed food and ordered the wild BLT (Alligator) and some pretzels. I am an avid fan of this place so I made a point to try their plates.  The alligator brat was amazing. would only suggest that it be in a bun rather than a wrap??? wraps seem to better accommodate meats that area cut or sliced. Just my opinion.   The pretzels were great! I am always astounded when I go out to eat and a restaurant cannot gets pretzels and cheese right?? I know I am not the only one thinking this. The portion size was generous so no complaints there either. the ketchup is made in house = Awesome. Can get some real flavors out of it rather than vinegar and sugar.  I only have to knock this review down a star since this time being sat outside I did see a bit of a lag in service times between our food order and drink refills. Nothing we felt we needed to complain about since we were in no rush that evening but I did notice a few tables scanning the floor for their server more than a few times.  side note: last time I had visited the bar was with my roommate and having showed up to an empty restaurant mid day we expected prompt service but were quickly derailed by a bar crawl that came in filling the floor from shoulder to shoulder and taking priority over our service. Was a bit annoyed but again was in no huge rush. but still, Priorities!!  Love the place and the brew selections! ill be visiting again no doubt!",

Outside of that, the staff was friendly though a bit \"flaky\".  I assume it's b/c they were very busy.  The tap options were endless and as others have mentioned, rotate as they go throughout the evening.  It's a great way to keep you coming back for more!  They have a beautiful patio with a lot more dining tables and that is where we got to sit.  I love eating outside in perfect AZ weather!  We got the veggie flatbread which was DEEEEELISH and can I just say ...Oh. Em. Gee with regard to the wings.  They were roasted to perfection and served with three sauces on the side, which was ingenious! I really enjoyed that touch so I could mix and match the sauce.  I am still drooling over the amazingness that was the wings!  Get them.  The beer options were also wonderful and the price point is average.  I would have spent more money here but I was jet-lagged and had to get back to the hotel before I passed out at my table after my two beers.  Light weight here.",

    "text": "I went here opening day late afternoon, met up with some fellow beer freaks. Overall I'm pleased! Building marking signage is on the south side wall, and parking is available in the dirt lot next to that wall as well as limited parking up front. Furniture is simple butcherblock tables, well laid out. The beer bar has a large chalkboard above it, 31 taps and several wines. Music is there, but not loud at all. Room acoustics might use some work, it gets a little loud in there but hey what do you expect with a house full of yapping beer freaks?!   Good variety of beers, offering the major breweries we already know such as Deschutes, Odell, Warsteiner (Dunkel), Epic, Sam Adams (a new style!), New Belgium, Green Flash, and more. Kegs blow all the time and something different is put on. Beers are priced $6,7,8. Snifter served for high ABV beers, PROPER TALL PINT glass for regulars and tulips for Beligian styles. No American \"pint\" glasses which actually serve 12 oz. plus head, those are for ice water.   **** INSIDE SKINNY:   The place has an outdoor patio out back, and now that the weather is getting cooler IT'S SUPER NICE OUT THERE for sunset and after. In fact it's really nice for a date with a candle on the table. Get one on the rear edge of the patio rather than near the door, it's quieter.  Sampler flights are available for a fair deal! Pick 6, write the tap numbers on the paper, and they'll be delivered in a muffin tray oriented with the paper!   So now on to the food! Yeah get ready.  The menu is gourmet scrumptious, and I CANNOT WAIT to try some of those things! These dishes have flavor combinations that will blow your mind just by reading them, and the choice WILL be difficult. You'll just have to convince yourself you'll try the other dish next time.  My recommendations:   The Chet: ($8.50) - Tortilla stuffed with fries, chorizo, black beans, roasted corn,  grilled chile peppers, chihuahua cheese, adobo sauce and crema. I saw this one, nice grill marks on the tortilla. SPICY.  The 810: (sammy,$8.50) Shaved smoked turkey, peppered bacon, avocado mash, pickled red onions, adobo sauce, side of pickled jalapeno long slices. Choice of side - I recommend the fries, they're flavorful and perfectly done.  Meat Treat Pizza: ($10) 10\" Flatbread pizza with peperoni, sausage, smoked bacon, LEEKS!!!, smoked mozz, roasted tomato sauce. Saw this one, the toppings just POP at you! Nice size too!  Warm Sausage Platter: ($10) Wild game!! Brat! Chorizo! with mustards and relishes. This comes out and it's SPECTACULAR.  Haven't had the burgers, but they look and smell scrumptious. My friend had the Southwest Burger.  I guess you can see what flavors I like, haha. Leeks for me ANYWHERE are a pleasant surprise as well.  Based on the most recent visit, I now upgrade to FIVE STARS! Very attentive and accurate service. My friend's iced tea was never neglected, and our large party was checked on every so often. (Gratuity added automatically for larger parties. 6 or more?)  So.... give this place a try, I think you'll be happy. After work for dinner would seem to be the best time before it gets too packed.

    "text": "Hmm. Really struggling to decide what to rate this place. That said, here are the highlights.  The building is really cool. Open concept with wood, tile, and brick. The beer selection is large and rotates during the night. Crowd as good as well. Pretty crowded.  Taking all that into consideration here are the lowlights.   The staff does not seem to be very knowledgeable about the beers they serve. Our waitress said that one of our choices was good choice. When we asked what was good about the beer she followed up \"I am not sure. I have not actually tasted that beer\". Just odd. Also, the system by which the update the beer list is a bit slow. We asked about a few beers. They turned out to be out of them.   All in all, I would definitely go back. Hopefully, they get the kinks worked out of the system.",

And they packed a serious punch.  Great recommendation by the guy behind the counter.  So at least on the beer side of things, they seem to have a good selection.  Do a little bit of asking, and I am sure there will be a beer just right for you.  Got the feeling it was a total hipster bar, which isn't really my style, but that didn't mean it was a bad place.  There is lots of tables and plenty of space in the bar area. Beers were inexpensive for a tall glass.  A short walk from downtown if you are in the area.",

When I ordered it, the waiter didn't know what I was talking about. I told him \"You know, the sahti (I didn't confuse him by pronouncing it Finnish style) from Sam Adams.\" Finally, I just gave him the number on the board. Then he scurried off. We never saw him again.   In the meantime, I checked out the food menu. It looked excellent. But we rolled in just as the kitchen closed at 10 p.m. on a Friday. No appetizers, no desserts, no nothin'.   My wife and I tried talking. But the exposed beams and concrete floors and walls that look so nice turn the volume up to where we had to yell at each other. After a few more minutes of waiting and not seeing a familiar waiter, we did something we've never done at a brewery/alehouse/taproom before: We walked out, still thirsty for a quality beer. We went to Sun Up, where we had a cask-conditioned IPA made with Simcoe hops that pretty well destroyed anything on-tap at Angels Trumpet.  We'll give Angels Trumpet another shot in the future - once we hear it has its act together.",

We like the Staff here, they are cool and friendly but not overly obsequious  like some pretentious downtown joints where they must have an a** kissing contest for TIPS going on.  PRETZELS are da bomb.  I had to alternate between the cheese dip and the spicy mustard with every other bite. Super Tasty! WINGS really nicely seasoned, NOT greasy. Meaty. Takes a little tooth action to strip them from the bone in a really good way, I think at one point I growled!  Spousal Unit reported his BURGER was high quality beef, well seasoned, cooked to order (still mooing) and the bun held up under the meaty pressure. My FISH TACOS were presented with just the right amount of black beans, some awesome spicy coleslaw and fresh avocado mash.  Fresh tortillas and nice flaky fried (deal with it) fish in just the right proportions.  The Beer?  But of course. Interesting. Worth doing a FLIGHT but ask for help, don't load up on all one style and miss the fun-fest in your mouth that comes from variety!",

Their beer selection is always great, except sometimes they are a little heavy on the IPAs.  This brings me to one of the best parts of this place, the people watching.  The \"normal\" crowed for this place will put the word Hipster to shame.  Plaid, Plaid, and more Plaid with some great thick frame glasses and Toms or Sperrys and everyone will love you.  If that is not your style go there to have some great laughs.   The wait staff knows the beer and always has great recommendations and will take care of all your needs. Even if people watching is not your thing go there for the amazing food and wait staff!!!",

Went on Sunday , Labor Day weekend, and it was busy, lively , and full of character. if someone told me there is a better place for enjoying a great selection of beer,  I would be very skeptical.  The micro brewery selection is incredible! After a long night of enjoying many of our favorite places along the light rail, we stopped in to try some beers. Jeannie isn't a beer drinker, but thoroughly enjoyed her on tap wine! Our beers were tasty and the spam sliders were the perfect late night snack . Count us in as fans!",

We split this steak sandwich with fries and we also split a flight of 6 beers to get an idea of what we'd order as our \"real\" drink.  I ended up ordering the Old Chub (Scottish Ale) and it was dark and amaze balls.  I enjoyed the beer and the food was average but definitely homemade so I would say the quality is good (a little bland but nbd) instead of ketchup we got some tomato blend.  I personally would have just enjoyed the ketchup.  Someone dropped a glass and I swear they swept for like 20 minutes (hipster slow) The bathrooms are unisex and clean BUT---- it smelt like piss in there..... I dunno I think the urinal might be the culprit..  There are 31 craft beers on tap and I am a huge fan of craft beers.",

    "text": "Always looking for the next great place to grab a beer and while hesitant due to it's awful name and terrible logo (figured this couldn't be a good sign), I decided the beer devotion claims on their website were enough to pull me in.  I'll start out by saying there is nothing worse than a \"beer bar\" carrying all the same domestic brew you'll find at your local dive bar. I can go anywhere to grab a tasteless lager, a slightly hopped pale or predictable red ale. With the recent explosion of craft over the past few years, I figured that so many of these places would pop up and easily be done correctly...WRONG! While many bars attempt to have a \"craft beer garden\" they still play it safe and that's unfortunate. ATAH does not, and that's why I was happy to give it my official seal of approval.  Walking in, I had no idea what to expect. I almost drove past the place and wasn't entirely certain which door to enter through (I think there was only one but I don't rememeber it being marked very well). Upon entering, we weren't greeted by anyone but the bar is where I head anyways. Simple concept inside, clean and hard to miss what's on tap. We ate a BBQ chicken sandwich, it was average...but I wasn't there for food. The beer selection was fantastic, offering a wide variety of brew and probably something to please everyone...and with 30+ taps, if you can't find something you like, that's your own problem. I loved the fact that they offered a handful of beer I had never seen on tap anywhere in Phoenix before, which is something pretty rare around here. This tells me what whoever is running this place isn't afraid to charge that extra buck or two for something a True beer lover will be happy to see on tap.  Also, I must mention one more thing I liked about this place. While AZ brewers and Crescent Crown sit around and try to push this whole \"Drink Local\" campaign in our faces, this place had two local taps. I thought that was just enough for what they could afford to offer based on tap real estate and respect local brewers. There is nothing more frustrating than a bar that thinks it's a good idea to gather tons of AZ beers and serve them all in one location. Here is a tip to any bar owners who think AZ beer is good for service: AZ beer is NOT good for service.  Great place and I will be back.",

    "text": "We went in there about a week after it opened and had a really bad experience there.  The beer was good, and the server we had was good, but the food was awful and the experience we had with the manager was what ultimately ruined the experience.  We ordered wings, and a quesadilla.  The wings looked and tasted either like they had been sitting out for an hour, or they were deep fried to a crisp.  The quesadilla had decent flavor, but was only about 1/8 of an inch thick and had very little filling, definitely not worth the $7 for such a small amount of food.  There are a lot of places in downtown I can go and get full for $7, this was like a 3 bite snack.    But, since we live downtown, and we like to support our local businesses, and considering the fact that they had only been open a week or so, we thought we'd give some helpful constructive feedback to the management in hopes they might improve.  So we asked to talk to a manager to tell him about the food.  So this guy comes over and we tell him the wings taste way too overdone, and the quesadilla tasted alright but was a poor value at $7.  We told him we were local, we were polite, and that we knew they had only been open a week and we  wanted to help them work out the kinks.    The manager immediately got really defensive and tried to tell us that the wings were fine (and that everyone else in the place who ordered them loved them)  and that they only use the very best ingredients and that's why the quesadilla was so expensive.  Then he basically tried to tell us that we were wrong and that there was no way that the food could have been that bad.  We were just trying to help a local place succeed, and this guy put a really bad taste in our mouth.   Arguing with a customer and trying to convince them that the bad food they just ate wasn't really bad is a perfect example of how not to run a restaurant.  All he had to do was simply say \"thank you for the honest feedback, we will consider your recommendations, and we would love it if you would come back and have a free appetizer on us so that you can see we're committed to improving.\"  We would have been back a dozen times by now, and told all our friends about it.  But instead he was a jerk.    We thought about coming back again after a few months, but every time we think about it, we just think of the manager.  And besides, there are lots of other great places in downtown Phoenix that have better, cheaper food, and good beer too.  So we haven't been back, and we probably won't ever unless something changes.",

Red ales are notoriously poor tasting as they are not very popular & sit too long(never fresh enough). This red ale was a game changer! Fresh, crisp & delicious. My boyfriend had a Belgian triple-also very good & fresh. We each had a burger. Mine was great & the fries were good too, just a lot to eat. His pork burger was a bit too rich for his liking, but he loved it, but his coleslaw missed the mark (fresh, but not exactly what you might expect coleslaw to be). The ambiance is nice, hipster/industrial type. I just felt it was a little less than welcoming (maybe too sterile). I will definitely come back & recommend it to anyone-especially beer lovers. Also, I can't wait for a Tuesday off to try their TV dinners!!!!",

The demographics are artsy/hipster in this \"North Phoenix\" enclave, near downtown.   The spam sliders were incredible; also, I highly recommend the \"Elvis-Type\" sandwich.",

We had the spam sliders for an app and omg i have thought about them every day since we had them! (They are that good) For dinner we shared the peanut butter and bacon sandwich with mellow fluff and preserves, all of which was homemade. It was all sorts of ooey gooey deliciousness!   PROPS TO THE CHEF who clearly knows what he is doing. You know a chef  has passion and truly cares when he is out  and about doing table visits.  Also the downtown view from the patio is beautiful.  All and all i can not wait to go back!",

    "text": "We had been wanting to go here for months after a few suggestions from friends, but mostly just after many times ofdriving or walking past the establishment and seeing it filled with people. After finally deciding to give it a shot, it wasn't long before we wondered why. The service was awful. The bartenders were inattentive and not at all communicative between one another in order to provide adequate service. I didn't think it was possible but the service was even worse once seated at a table outside. The waitress was not at all friendly or even accommodating. She acted as if she could not care less about us or any of our questions. To top it off, I ordered a beer that was then brought to me by some random guy who set it down, said something about it being \"a shorty\", and walking away. Come to find out, this 4.5 ounce beer cost $4.00 because the keg went out. When asked about the price, the manager came over to explain that they don't know when the keg will run out so it was the best they could do, and I was given and charged the price appropriate based on what was left. At this point, I was SHOCKED To find out that all this time, the Angel's Trumpet, did not, in fact, hire psychics to run their establishment for the sole purpose of sensing when each keg will tap throughout he night. Mind blown. Turns out though, despite the lack of psychics and service industry \"professionals\" on staff, the beer, regardless of how full or how great the quality is,still comes at quite the cost. The manager was nice enough to knock about 50 cents off the price of my sub par and anything but full glass, and apparently that was even asking too much by the look on her face and the snobby motions of her hands. I could go on and on, but frankly, I've already arrived at somewhere MUCH cooler that actually has beer that I can drink and I've already given this place more recognition than it deserves.",

It was wonderful and definitely lead to our second visit. The misses to me the first go around were the food and the noise level. The outdoor patio was also very dark. The lighting was better for the second visit, but I have yet to retry the food. I got the pizza but wasn't impressed. Just an odd flavor paring. The noise level wasn't as bad this time, but that could have been because it wasn't as busy and  opening the doors also helped. Can't wait to get back for more good beer and great patio weather soon.",

The waitress wasn't able to give to many suggestions based on the type of beers we told her we liked.   On all honesty, if you work in an ale house you should know your beers.    I ordered the matador sandwich which was barbecue brisket with havarti cheese, mushrooms, peppers and horseradish sauce.  The waitress food was brought out and the sand which looked like roast beef.  I took a bite, sure enough it was roast beef and it was dry...super dry.  I asked the waitress and she came back and told me that she made a mistake and was supposed to tell me that the sandwich is now made with roast beef and the menus haven't been updated.  She of course apologized and I had to wait for my sandwich.  My husband, had finished his meal and they finally brought out a sandwich made with brisket.  The sandwich was definitely not worth the wait, not to mention I was eating alone.  The sandwich was supposed to have havarti cheese and I barely saw the cheese.  The meat was dry and had very little flavor.  On top if it all, the waitress didn't even comp the sandwich.  I don't ever plan on returning to this place again.  It's unfortunate we wasted a date night baby free at this establishment.",

I've been a server before and to hv a manager and server behave the way they did tonight is unbelievable! ! All we asked was to switch out a beer that we didn't like (after not being offered a Taster) and even offered to pay for for the replacement but the server said \"no\" and so did the manager after asking to speak with him. It was \"against policy\"... what happened to satisfying the customers  in the service industry? We ordered dessert - the poptarts and after all the ruckus back and forth we lost our appetite and didn't even eat the dessert nor drank the beer that I wanted to return.  But yet was charged for both. I was told there's a policy on the menu that says you cannot exchange drinks.  Which I thought was ridiculous especially after not being offered a taster. All in all it was just wrong because the manager could have replaced the drink and just said moving forward, \" now you know our policy\" but nope, he charged us for both items and that resulted in the server not even getting a tip. Very disappointed.  Shocked and will never recommend to friends.",

We paid it without asking for our check to be corrected because we wanted the heck out of there and it was getting busy.

It looks like an office building from the outside and from the inside, it looks like a cozy place to grab a bite to eat and a beer. Their beer selection is pretty awesome and featured on a chalkboard on the back wall.  I ordered the Fall Cider by Woodchuck and the grilled cheese sandwich dinner. The cider was delicious and perfectly chilled. The grilled cheese was SO good! I love the fact that they put mint on it - so unique and surprisingly tasty! The fries were not that great because they seemed to be a bit undercooked.  G's meal was a burger (if memory serves) and the \"chips\". He said they were both good.  So, what we both didn't like were the awful chairs. They are wooden slats and very uncomfortable to sit on for any length of time. The place was only about 1/4 full and we couldn't hear each other even though we were sitting directly across from one another. The place has to do something about the acoustics - it is far too loud to be able to carry on a conversation. And, the only other negative was the lighting. Instead of real overhead lighting, they have gone with tiny candles on the tables. It was too dark to read the menu unless you had it right up against the table.  Other than those issues, the place was great!",

After 45 minutes of waiting, we decided to leave. I stopped the bus boy 3 times and asked for them to mention to the server we were ready to order drinks and food. I stopped two other servers who said we weren't in their area, and they would get the person who's zone we were in. She appeared once or twice, quickly running to other tables, while ignoring ours. I can't say I am interested in returning after wasting a trip. There appeared to be some sort of event that that bar was aware of, that they completely failed to adequately staff for (a mid day pub crawl type of thing). I watched a couple of other groups walk out as well. They lost a lot of business that day.",

As we looked around we noticed that while everyone had a brew in front of them not many had ordered any food.  We found out why when they brought our orders out. My smokin' legs were more like burnt-to-a-crisp and the veggies spread out over the french fries were limp and tasteless. It was my first time here but my friends had decided to give the kitchen another chance cuz they had the same culinary experience the previous week  We'll probably be back for the beer but someone should fire the cook!

The flatbread pizza with goat cheese was on the salty side and the goat cheese was not creamy, but more like feta.   The rotating beer selection is great but when I got the sampler last night 3 out of the 6 beers were not very good.

The beer list is located at the back of the bar which was a little difficult to see honestly from all the tables.  I would say the food was just so-so and seemed greasy to me.    We tried the spud tacos (a little blah and lacked a whole lot of flavor),  the avocado salad (which had greens that were extremely bitter and three small pieces of grapefruit) and the 810 sandwich (which had okay flavor but was greasy). In total, our dinner, took nearly two hours! Luckily I was not in a rush that evening or I would have been extremely frustrated.   Hopefully they'll get the kinks worked out as they are open longer but I can't say I'll be going back.",

The only bad thing i have to say about the place is that it seems like most of the servers don't know much about the beers they are selling... You have to order by the tap number... I tried ordering by name and on both occasions two seperate servers replied \"huh?\" and looked really confused. Get some real beer afficianados serving to make it a better experience.

There are old house converted into cool new repurposwd builings.  There is cool painted murals all over this area.  When we were done looking we decided to stop here for a beer or two.  We got seated right away and sat at a table.  We each orderd flights so we could try several new beers.  Each flight was 6 beers.  They had like 40-50 different craft beers on tap to choose from.  We had already eaten so we didnt order any food.  I will say though everything coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled amazing.  Before leaving my brother orderd an apple pop tart or strudle as a dessert.  This was homemade and very good.   We recommend everyone to try one of these before leaving....",

It just feels that hip.   It's the type of place that \"The Middle\" by Dj Snake would play ad Infinitum. It's chill yet hip. Diverse yet monochromatic. Liberal but conservative. The place truly caters to all personality types.  I got a burger because I had just watched that episode of SpongeBob when he dueled Poseidon for best Kraby Patty - and also because I need to eat something to stop that rising feeling of drunkenness.  Legit though. Their craft beer and hamburgers are on point. I got a cider and it did not disappoint. Like dat Appleseed boi himself made it. And then the hamburger and fries were to die for. I legit zoned out my friends talking to me for at least an hour (I am not a fast eater) because I was too focused on eating my burger.  When I was done, I got the check in a timely manner from a kind waiter. It was quite affordable!   Angels was a nice stop to refresh and  refuel before I went back out on the town. If you're a Phoenix resident - get in there now and chow down, it will be worth it. If you're just passing through, make sure half your stay is here. For real.",

I went with a cucumber ale that was very refreshing and an order of wings that were surprisingly delicious. I say this both having taking a short break from being vegan, and also I didn't have high expectations as this was the first time I've ever eaten here.

Never received water, asked for a order, nothing. We watched while 3 other tables that came in after us were seated and served. Made an attempt to speak to multiple servers around us at other tables and mostly ignored. Finally I decided I did not want to give my money to anyone there that night so we got up and left.

I was apprehensive because other reviewers have said it's not kid friendly. While I wouldn't say that's entirely not True, they did have a high chair for the littlest one and a kids menu that's fairly priced for the amount of food they give. My daughter had a pepperoni pizza that I tried a slice of. It was really good, not too greasy and a very thin and crispy crust. I had the pork burrito and it was pretty good. The burrito was a good size and the pork had great flavor and was very tender. The amount of chips they give with it was comically tiny, I think there were 6 total and that's not an exaggeration. However, for me, that was plenty considering the size of the burrito. I could see someone who is really hungry being upset though since they specifically mention the chips on the menu.  No doubt about it, their primary focus is beer which is probably why my youngest sister suggested it. I didn't try any but I like beer so I wouldn't be opposed to coming back to try some.",

    "text": "Just a solid place for food and beer. Great beer selection. Some are definitely offbeat, so I love the sampler option (six decent sized pours). We went on Tuesday to enjoy TV Dinner night. It was an interesting mix of food - chipotle mac and cheese, salad, rice and beans, biscuit and a margarita dessert bar. Definitely carb heavy, but a great deal for $9. Had to try to the homemade Pop Tart - blueberry with a balsamic rosemary reduction drizzle. So delicious. I was stuffed but could not stop eating it. Comfortable, laid back setting, nice patio, friendly service. A great stop before a downtown event.",

Speaking as a long time server/bartender, the wait staff seems terribly disorganized. Good luck trying to get another beer, have a server check on you after you get your food, or close out your tab. Either they're terribly understaffed, or their employees do not understand table service techniques.   Will I return? Probably if friends want to, but I won't ever suggest it again.",

Because they had the smoker I went with the brisket sandwich which was well done.",

    "text": "I think Angels Trumpet Ale House (besides having an awesome name) is a really neat place to hang out with friends, sample interesting beers, and take a breather after a busy week. Service can be a tad slow because of how busy it can get, but the servers are friendly and really helpful. The ambiance inside is a cross between casual hipster bar and comfortable after-work hangout bar. I like the wooden tables and stools, not to mention the outside seating in the backyard when the weather is nice.  Angels Trumpet's claim to fame -- and rightly so -- is their beer flights. The system is to grab a piece of paper with six circles drawn on them, write down the beers you'd like to sample using the numbering system updated on a blackboard, and prepare to be excited. The beer selection is unique and ranges from deep and smooth to tangy and fruity. I tend to lean towards lighter, fruitier beers, and out of the ones I've tried, the blood orange cider is hands down my favorite. I'm not a frequent drinker, but taste comes first in my book, and the blood orange cider was a great balance of acidic, fruity, and refreshing.   While the drink portion of the menu is impressive, I found the food portion rather lackluster, which was disappointing because I find drinks are always better when paired with good finger food.   Hot pretzels: These pretzels were advertised as using beer batter, if I remember correctly, and I was excited for the soft, airy pillows to pair with my beer flight. Unfortunately the pretzels themselves were rather dense and hard on the outside, and they were virtually inedible once they had cooled down a little. The cheese sauce was pretty good, the mustard was unremarkable, and overall I didn't think this was worth the ~$10 asking price.   Hummus platter: This platter was pretty generous in size, and the hummus was pretty flavorful taste-wise. It wasn't as smooth as I would've liked, with some chunks of garbanzo that hadn't been blended in. I liked the cucumber pairing, but the pita bread was dry and floury without much of that freshly-made fragrance I was looking for.   Poutine: The size of this dish was again generous, and we couldn't finish it even between three people, but the positives stopped there. The fries were limp and soggy, even the ones that hadn't been covered with gravy. The gravy was definitely not freshly made, and when paired with the fries, there was an overall flavor of \"having sat around for too long\" (if anyone knows the proper vocabulary word for that, please tell me!). I wouldn't recommend ordering this on the off chance that it is freshly made that day.  I'd certainly come back for hanging out and sampling some unique beers, but not for the food.",

There are Adirondack chairs and corn hole available outdoors. Beer selection is large but was under-whelming in our opinion. We were trying to stay with local beers but the sign outside didn't have Brewery names or locations so you would have to ask the server for this information. We had the wings and a burro for food. The wings were AMAZING. Great sauce called moose drool that you must get. Finished up with the homemade pop tarts which were raspberry churro I believe and absolutely worth it. Parking lot was small but we got lucky getting a spot. There is parking around the area if you can't get a spot in the lot. Definitely worth checking out!",

    "text": "Any time we cant decide where to eat, Angel's Trumpet is our go-to. They have a large seating area, incredible beer and wine list (seriously its a whole wall) and pretty standard but tasty food.  They even have a large patio with outdoor seating, games, and is pet friendly. The only bad part of the place is parking is very limited and the place tends to be packed.   I always go for the Matador but all of their sandwhiches and burgers look amazing. And I love anything on a pretzel bun. They used to have tattertots but the last time I went, I was told they no longer make them (hopefully they started again).  But really the food isnt what brings people into Angel's Trumpet, its good but it isnt anything you couldn't find better somewhere else. What brings people in is their huge tap list, which is always changing. It's their home made poptarts that are incredible, and their Tuesday night TV dinners which change weekly and are only available to first come first serve customers. Ive yet to come in on a Tuesday but I've religiously followed them since the first time I heard about it, and you can see what they'll have on their Facebook. If you're not sure what to think of their expansive drink menu: get a flight of a few beers, try a bit of everything and you're sure to not be let down. The servers are also great at offering suggestions, whether you're trying to pair with your meal or just your personal preference.  The story about Angel's Trumpet is also a pretty cool one, the owner used to own the building for years and when he retired, it was his dream to run a gastropub, so he converted his old office building into Phoenix's very first gastropub. And with all the changes hitting downtown, I love the idea that a local man wanted to create something he loved out of the place he retired rather than just selling the spot to another condominium company.",

Fries were disappointing, although they have great potential. Some were outstanding, cooked/seasoned perfectly, but others, including the first couple bites, tasted bad, like they were old or had been through the frier 3+ times...not a good first impression.

The gravy tasted like thickened au jus. Their burger was delicious, too. The brisket grilled cheese was odd. There was an almost Italian herb in it. Their salad had good mixed greens and the vinaigrette was good, but that same vinaigrette was tossed over fresh cabbage to make the coleslaw, which was then topped with feta cheese and craisins.   The waitress did seem like her day would have been a lot better if we had decided to go elsewhere, though. And for a table of two, it's a little odd to be met with that attitude from the waitstaff.

Awesome food.  Chill indoor atmosphere.  Great friendly service.    Flatbreads are really good, salads are good and the sausage platter which I just had was amazing.",

    "text": "Wow! First and foremost, I was pleasantly surprised by Angels Trumpet! Traditionally, my expectations for food at alcohol establishments is quite low, but this Ale House really brings it with their menu and food!    Our table started with the Pretzel Bites as an appetizer, yum! These come in sets of 4 bread buns with two dipping sauces on the side. The buns are pipping hot and topped with course sea salt and are nice and buttery. After a strong recommendation from my friends who were returners at the establishment, I ordered the BBQ Brisket Grilled Cheese with fries. YUM! This was a heavy, large meal, but it sure was delicious.   To round off our indulgent meal, we decided to order two desserts to share. We got the special, which was a cookie dough and ice cream roll dipped in dark chocolate and the homemade pop tart. Both were amazing. The cookie roll was very unique and the pop tart was hot and flakey and tasted like a pie. I was surprised to find that the food and dessert were both amazing.   The only downfall to this place is how popular it is! We waited about an hour for our table and the place continued to be packed through the night. It is a popular place for large groups and drinks, so you can expect evenings to be packed.",

So this place hit the spot. We were there for last call for food (the chicken sandwiches are ridiculously good as are the fries). Also got to sample the beer selections. Between the table we all got to try a coffee stout, a double IPA, a lager or two, a porter...not a bland one in the batch.",

The ONLY reason why I'm NOT giving this place 5 stars...They have a HUGE, actually 2 HUGE chalk boards where they post the 30-40 or so beers they have on tap. Which is awesome. But I like to sort of have a selection of different types and a history on the beers, like where they are from ect... The servers usually know but not every beer. So you either have to ask, know or look up on your phone, plus it's sorta hard to read, just overwhelming.   Other then that, the patio is dog friendly. I've spent a day or to on it drinking with a friend and her dog just relaxing. They even have water bowls for the dogs.   The food selection is a bit limited but they best thin on the menu is the meat pizza, the shit is probably one of the best pizza's i've ever had.  Oh and you can fill up your personal growlers here too.",

Spam sorta tastes like a hotdog, with a different sort of consistency. Topped with feta slaw on a toasted mini bun, they're damn tasty.   You've also got an excellent beer selection. It's chalked up on a huge board by number, with a description and ABV and Price. As the tap runs dry, they erase it and put in a new one. The rotation is ever changing. The servers are also really knowledgable about all of the beers and can give you a taste if you're unsure about a selection. You can also do a flight of six if you're looking for a varied selection of beers. No liquor, but they do have some wines.  The atmosphere is lively and loud and the clientelle is all over the board. If you're a smoker, you've got an outdoor patio with heaters.   This is also a great place for a date. The loud atmosphere makes it a fun place to talk and not feel like you have to whisper or feel awkward if there is a pause in the conversation.   I would absolutely come back!",

Where to begin...? The beer!!! 31 rotating taps and a killer bottle list mean that they have something for everyone. The staff are unpretentious and very knowledgeable so if you're not sure where to begin just ask.   The design and furnishings are very well thought out. The food is dynamite and they run all sorts of delicious specials. The mural on the south wall is totally rad. The view of the skyline from the back patio any time of the day is unparalleled.   So yeah. Favorite place. Anywhere. Hope they experience grand success for many years.",

It was a five or ten minute walk of the stop. It looks a little uninviting from the outside.. Took a minute to find the door.. But once we got it it was really cool. They had a lot of beers on tap - we don't drink - but they had a wide selection. The food was awesome. I got a bacon burger and she got the grilled cheese. The grilled cheese had honey on it , which sounds weird, but she raved about it. It had a hipster sort of feel. They make their own pop tarts which sounded cool but they only had peanut butter and due to an allergy would work. But overall, we'd go back. Maybe once we move downtown!",

I had #3, a raspberry wheat by grand canyon brewing; smell of raspberry and initial taste is the fruit with the after taste being kinda creamsicle-y. They also have draft wines.  So, to start off, we had the Mess, which was a mess, but a hot delicious one! The gravy that comes atop the fries was delish. The fries weren't too skinny and didn't get too soggy from the gravy but then again, I don't we let it sit long enough to get soggy. And the cheese curds made for a nice crunch with it. After eating it, I really wanted to add Spam and get a side of gravy lol. Maybe next time.  After the mess, it was now onto the pizza - the meaty treat. It certainly was a meaty treat for your mouth. It had all sorts of meat but with the added Spam, what can I say but 'heaven' (I'm Asian and I love my Spam). Next time, and there will be a next time, there should be a flight involved and another pizza with more Spam lol.",

Three different sauces to dip in, fried in a good batter/seasoning. Moving onto the tacos.... No shortage of flavorful fish, dipped in a good batter and fried perfectly. The beans are to die for, my only complaint was the shortage of beans... Next time I go, I will order an extra side of beans. This place is a must try with a hipster feel to it.

The bartenders and waitress are very knowledgeable and will help you choose a beer that you love.  We prefer to have them help us create a sampler (6 beers) and go from there.  The food is even great!  We have had the pretzels which are amazing the beer cheese makes it.  The pretzel itself is much softer and not as salty as you are probably used to but sooo good.  I have also tried the spam sliders which was AMAZING! haha I know what you are thinking spam gross but it is good and you have to try it!  Only bad thing that I have to say is the parking SUCKS!

I've had more then I can count and they never disappoint.  I wish I could say I was exaggerating when I say I've had everything on their menu over the years...and there's not a single thing I didn't like. This time around we had the meat treat pizza and one of the newer items on the menu a fried chicken sandwich, the name of which I can't remember for the life of me but it had a jalapeno ranch on it that was ridiculously good. Whatever you do don't forget to order a homemade pop tart! The flavors are seasonal and it currently blueberry with a balsamic rosemary reduction on top. I wanted to lick the plate.  Oh man I almost forgot about the beer. A rotating selection of 30 craft beers, yes please! Get a beer flight for 9$ to try 6 at time. It's one of my favorite parts about going.  If you're still reading this and not on your way to Angel's Trumpet for dinner tonight Idk what you're doing with your life!",

I couldn't figure it out? Maple cinnamon pecan?  Service was slow and tge waiter only came 2 times.  Worth a try.",

I have been here lots and have had maybe one server who knew something about the great stuff they have on tap. Do not trust them for a recommendation. This can easily be fixed with training. It hasn't.  The bigger issue is this business's role in killing the Roosevelt BID. Furthermore, arguing that they MADE the area worth coming to when the arts community has worked for decades to bring people to downtown Phoenix. Owners are pompous and show a disregard for other local businesses. If you want to support local (which I hope you do), please look elsewhere. Will not be going back.",

Sign me up for three of them!  HUGE beer selection that is always changing. They also have wine, too!  The place is open late and serves until about 11pm on the weekdays, not sure about the weekends?   GO HERE. EAT ALL THE FOOD. DRINK ALL THE BEER.",

The food is also good with a slight twist in the burgers and pizzas.  I like that you can come anytime during the week just to grab a cold one.  The staff is super friendly and always have good suggestions for the food as well as beer (because we all have different beer tastes).   The prices for the flights are good (to me)  considering what you get for the price.  I like the ambiance and chill factor this place and come here often when I'm in the mood to just relax and grab a beer.",

I haven't eaten a lot of food there because the veg options blow.  I pride myself in patronizing local businesses and enriching the community of which I am a part, however the owner of this establishment doesn't care about his community. Thanks for tanking the Roosevelt BID, A-hole. You wanna know what's NOT free? My business!  I was already accidentally boycotting Angels Trumpet for quite some time because it sucks. Now I will continue to avoid this place and let my friends know that it's not a downtown-friendly bar. I'll be sharing this with everyone I know.",

If you're going to have a wide range of beers, your staff need to be able to speak about them, let alone pronounce the names (they always had to search around for the number.) The food is bland and very expensive for what it is.   Not to mention the owner is actively undermining the local arts and creative scene. He works to railroad the Roosevelt BID, complaining that he'd have to pay more taxes while all the \"parasitic\" artists in the area get things for free (his words...). He moved into this neighborhood and has cashed in on downtown's renaissance (driven by the very people he undermined by tanking the BID.) Shameful behavior from someone who must not value their neighbors or the unique neighborhood. Anyone who cuddles up with Ducey isn't someone who gets my money.",

Waiter returns to demand $40 more. He claims he returned the entire amount I paid him, including the 2x$20s and now needs $40. We ask for the manager. Manager says she knows I paid with a $10 because she made change for it. But why would you break a $10 bill when you were claiming that I had underpaid & you'd returned all that I had paid. Very unsettling, this situation.  Pay with a credit card here so that there is a clear record!",

I'm intrigued by their tv dinner tray specials - will eventually have to make it there to try it one day.   Discovered a little fun fact on my visit this past Saturday (first visit not on First Friday), they close at 12am. I really assumed they would've been open til 2am on weekends, nope.  Also, we made it in just 20 minutes before closing this past visit and got poor service from one of the bartenders. She seemed very annoyed by our presence and was very rude in her response to our questions. Also had a resting bitch face on the entire time. So, I'd suggest not to bother them anytime before closing.",

They had a unique selection on tap, not just your IPA, Wit, Lager list.  Jake was our server and he was awesome!! His beer knowledge was on point, and gave us some good suggestions. I had a taquitto appetizer and my buddy had the brisket tacos, all of which had nice flavors. I finished off with homemade pop tarts and an aged chocolate stout, which I will be fondley thinking about for the next few days.

First, the place is much bigger than I had initially expected and very very good for large groups (I know where I'm having my next birthday!). They offer, I think it was almost 30 at the time, beer choices. I went with a flight so I could try a few different ones I'd been eyeing. They all tasted great but I don't drink quite enough beer that I could really say I knew exactly what I was drinking. Along with the flight, I ordered, \"The Mess,\" which is essentially poutine. It was soooo good! The fries were crunchy, the gravy was stewy, the cheese curds squeaky! Although I made it my meal, it can definitely be shared amongst the table. Also at the table were the well talked about spam sliders and grilled cheese sandwich. All good choices!   Overall, a great experience! I can't wait to come back for a TV dinner Tuesday, another new beer, or a pop tart!",

If you're feeling overwhelmed by the choices (there are 31 after all, not even counting the wine), ask for a sampler platter! My boyfriend and I got lucky and got a free drink from Fat Bikes who was doing a promotion. If you're looking for a hip location just to hang out with friends and throw a couple back, this is the place for you. The only down sides are that 1. Bar space is very limited and the overall venue extremely packed- there's restaurant seating as well. 2. The bar tenders were efficient but were very low on energy and enthusiasm. It was mildly making me depressed just watching them.",

    "text": "We came here for dinner on a trip to Phoenix. It had really good reviews. The atmosphere was really nice. The food looked really good on yelp and let me tell you IT WAS. The food was absolutely delicious. I ordered the Brulee burger. My fiancee got the Outlaw. We also ordered chips and salsa. That's actually the first reason I deducted a star. The chips and salsa were $7 and you get the tiniest side of salsa and the tiniest side of beans. I did not think they were even kind of worth the price. The burgers on the other hand 100% worth the price. The house made ketchup was awesome. We both also ordered ginger beer. Each ginger beer was $3.50. I drank almost half of my ginger beer and saved the rest for my meal(a habit I've always had). I went to the restroom and came back to just a water. I figured out that the waitress had accidentally filled my ginger beer with water. So i told her what had happened and she asked \"Does it kinda taste good or?\" I was just like What do you think?! Lol. Have you ever had a watered down soda? No it does not taste good.  The weird thing was no one offered a replacement. She just asked if I wanted a new water. I had dumped the ice before I poured my ginger beer into the glass so maybe it didn't look that full but my ginger beer was still at least half full if not 3/4 full. And it stayed on the bill too. I didn't like that I paid full price for a beverage that was ruined by the staff and I was never offered a replacement. I just think it's basic customer service skills to always make it right for the customer, especially if the mistake is on their end. But other than that, I would recommend this restaurant.",

I've also ordered the homemade pop-tart on separate occasions and it is definitely NOT the type of pop tart that comes out of a box! Happy to report it's gooey and flakey, just like a homemade baked favorite should be. I've also tried their burgers and it's hearty goodness.  And of course, the beers. There's so many beers to choose from it's hard not to find just what you're in the mood for. Solid food and great place to hang out.",

We lucked out that it wasn't SUPER hot out, so we were happy to soak up the warm weather. Their beer selection was huge so we decided to try a few by getting a flight. We didn't end up having dinner here, but their food selection seemed to be pretty good as well. I'm honestly struggling to remember the names of the beers we had, but I am confident that you should check this place out if you're in the mood for a Phoenix brewery hopping day.",

We sat on the patio enjoying the weather. I can totally see this place busy during the weekends and week nights.   Unfortunately, I did not order an alcoholic beverage but I wish I did. Hubby and I ordered the Outlaw burger with fried egg and the pretzels appetizer.   I wish the pretzels were a little softer as they were a little tough to eat. The Outlaw burger and fries were delicious! I loved how they made their season fries.   Closer to the end of our meal, the restaurant started to pick up customers - a lot of customers and it looked like there was only one server so once it started getting busy, we didn't see her. We had to hunt down an employee, which happen to be the host to give us water refills and to ask for our check.   Overall, I plan to visit again especially during TV dinner nights.",

However, Im sad to say that the service was 1 star. Right after our food was delivered she did come ask how it was and then we didnt see her again. About 10 minutes into our food my husband was ready for another beer and i was out of water. We saw her going back and forth to other tables but she was not close enough for us to get her attention.  It was awkward because we spent the rest of our meal debating: do we go ask the bartender, do we keep trying to make eye contact? We didnt want to come across as rude but we probably should have just gone to the bar.   Eventually, she and i made eye contact and her expression let me know that she had forgotten us and she rushed right over. Unfortunately, we had been done for a while so we ordered some poptarts to go and left.   We are definitely going to go back. Hopefully the service experience was just a fluke. Everything else was really great.",

It was bumpin for a Wednesday evening, but it never got too crowded or loud or annoying. There's a ton of beers on tap, and good variety at that. And they do flights. Also, you can you watch them can crowlers behind the bar (lol the machine is fun to watch). I took a while to decide what to eat because the menu seemed ordinary and not very creative. I was so wrong, my sandwich was excellent. I got the \"good ole fashioned\" with grilled chicken and bacon. Also, the ketchup is homemade which made the fries taste even better. Literally cleaned my plate. The bartenders were super nice and attentive, too. I felt adequately tended to without constantly being bothered, or \"over-chatted\" with. Always had everything I needed and was able to just chill. Would definitely recommend. If I lived in Phoenix, I would probably come here often.",

    "text": "I have been here three times, and now feel compelled to write a quick review.  Visit #1: About a year ago, we were checking out a \"new\" place in our neighborhood. Beer was great, service was so-so, food was not good. The ambience was loud and lively, super hipster-friendly, and they have cool wooden tables. Nice, we thought; but the food sucks.  Visit #2: Gave it a second shot, figured we ordered wrong. Nope. Food sucked again. I like good pub food, and I like to try interesting combos like bacon & pesto, things marinated in beer, and gamey appetizers like buffalo meat or venison something or other. They have all these things, and we didn't like any. We ordered a few items, and the waiter said they were out of several ingredients b/c they were changing their menu. Place was still packed, beer flight was interesting.   Visit #3: We saw some killer pics online of their \"tv dinners\" and succumbed to our boredom and gave this place another try. Maybe the new menu was better, or they got a different chef or something. Nope. Food sucked again, and waiter was dull and silent. That's a grand total of around 4 appetizers, 8 entrees, and about a six-pack worth of crafty beers. Nothing great here food wise.   Tips: Stick to just getting beer. They have no ketchup, only a tomato-paste thing for your fries/tots. Wait staff looked like they would rather be across the street at Filmbar.",

Flavor at the time was banana walnut, a la mode, and I'd likely hand over my first born for another. Needless to say, you should save room for dessert. Beef burger was beautiful looking but surprisingly bland despite the trimmings, we even got it with the egg.",

It's great beer usually and I appreciate the look/construction.  But parking is atrocious. The service has been horrid on every occasion.  Whether sitting at the bar or at a table, it takes forever to get served or have orders followed up upon to put it mildly.    The food is ok. Not great. Not bad. Just ok for the price.    I keep hoping the service improves, but it just hasn't. It has gotten to the point where I only stop in for rare beer events now. And even then I question if it's worth giving them the money given the lack of service/hospitality.   Recommended.  But only if you're not in a hurry...",

We came in and waited a 5-100th minutes while the waiter, who looked right at us when we sat, talked to another patron about different kinds of beers. The service was incredibly slow and there were only 4 other tables with 1-3 people there besides us. The bar area was fuller but the bartender was helping them. We ordered the Brewlee and the Outlaw burger which were really tasty. However the fries were burnt and more than half were inedible. We just left them there....didn't complain cause we thought maybe that's how they were. We looked on the yelp site after and the fries looked totally different and not burnt to a crisp at all. Just a couple of ideas to maybe just be better on service and watch the quality of the food since the burgers are $10 plus.",

That is to say it's so freaking loud you will not, and cannot have a conversation. Clearly the owners are aware, as there are a handful of acoustic tiles on the ceiling, but they need considerably more.   Service was so so, our server kinda tried but she had way too many tables to be effective. I ordered the pretzel app and I have never seen greasy pretzels until now. Their pretzels are more like mini-baguettes and they are super oily. The app came with a mustard and some kind of warm cheese sauce, allegedly. It was so weird, there was 0.0 flavor in the cheese sauce. None. Nada. Zip. The only thing it had going for it was that it was warm.  Our app came with no napkins or flatware and it took 20 minutes to find someone to bring napkins.   Overall this place is better than a kick in the nuts- but it's not a comfortable place to chill with a cold beer.  It only makes me miss The Roosevelt even more than ever, and for that I tip my 40.",

This pic is a chocolate porter called Achocalypse, definitely one of the best porters I have tried there. The food is ok. Not exactly your typical bar food, they have a good selection on the menu...

I also noticed a selection of wines on tap and a very nice large dog friendly patio.  I ordered what I think was called the avocado salad and it really was among one of the best salads I ever had anywhere. It was unique and interesting and something better than what I would have at home because I wouldn't take the time to smoke my own beets. The combination of creamy avocado, mild goat cheese and smoked beets with those tasty little just the right amount of toasted almonds was quite a sensation in my mouth. I will have to steal that one as it really was that good. The greens were very fresh and above average and the dark meat chicken option was tasty and cooked just right. I also enjoyed the supreme segments of grapefruit as they added so much brightness and freshness and really cut the richness in the salad. The salad had everything going on it was really good.  My husband had the matador sandwich, it was pink beef with onions, peppers, mushrooms, horseradish Havarti cheese and a pretzel roll with two dipping sauces and fries. I didn't taste it but I thought it looked good. My husband said it was good but would have liked the peppers cooked more and more of them.  I would like to try the beer sampling option next time.  I thought the meals were reasonably priced. If I remember correctly the total including tax was around $23.00.",

There are letters that are next to the beers which tell you what glasswear the beer is served in. We also had the farm flatbread. Which was also pretty tasty! It was kind of messy though because it wasn't cut all the way and the utensil they give you is a fork and a really dull butter knife. In the end you just give up and grab what you can and just eat.

Their patio is so awesome and they are dog friendly too so they will allow you to bring your pooch to the patio.  My favorite dish I have to get every time I go is the avocado salad without the grapefruit and extra beets instead.   They have speedy Wi-Fi too.  I have studied here or accomplished work before the crowd gets there.  The only downfall is it gets REALLY loud in there and there isn't much parking.",

One suggestion...try the beer sampler, six three oz pours and you can try everything.  One more thing...alcohol content probably averages higher then normal...be careful.  A great place.  Thanks for a great experience.",

Walk in grab a menu and seat yourself in their large indoor or outdoor seating area. Pick your beers or draft wine from a large blackboard that rotates new beverages in often. The food is down to earth and full of flavor, with employees knowing their favorites and making personal recommendations rather than a blanket statement of what's good or not. Service is quick and attentive without being bothersome nor sloppy. The sandwiches are something unique yet familiar - and excited to try the rest of the menu and rotating specials menu. Great spot for a date or get together with friends, kids would be fine but doesn't seemed to be geared toward them",

I can't even begin to explain how amazing it was, smoke for e 12+ hour it was great, I've been lucky every time I come in the same guy \" Ben \" ironically same name as the chef\" had been behind the bar and takes us on a tour of the country and craft beers, dudes an ace when it comes to good beer, today he recommended the \" Thai speedway \" from alesmith, ca.... such a delicious craft, if you're in the area this place NEVER DISSAPOINTS!!!

I don't think the burgers are anything to rave about. The Mess fries are yum! But let me tell you... You should try the PB&J with marshmallow fluff. My son ordered one off the kids menu and it was enormous! He didn't finish which meant Don and I got to try some of it. Amazing! Maybe beyond amazing... Life changing maybe. They make the peanut butter in house and the jelly has some spice to it which I love. And the marshmallow fluff just sends it over the top. I tried to replicate this PB&J at home unsuccessfully. My son will not let me attempt it again.   On to the real good stuff. The BEERS! They have an amazing selection of craft beers from all over. They always have some amazing IPAs and double/imperial IPAs on the beer wall. Always with the different styles of lots of high gravity beers. Totally worth it if you like trying different beers without getting drunk. You can get flights of six different beers for about seven bucks. Don't forget to check out the seasonal menu with specials like on Sundays you can get a pitcher of a local brew for six dollars. Pretty smoking deal if you ask me.   Definitely a place I enjoy and will be returning very very soon!",

Don't ask me which of the many beers we ordered because I can't remember...  ...Because all I can remember is how insanely divine and delicious our dessert was!  We ordered the salted caramel flatbread that came highly recommended to us by a friend (see my picture I posted, #147).  It is completely homemade on a nice thin crispy flatbread.  Peanut Butter.  Caramel.  Marshmallow fluff.  Chocolate Chips.  Honey.  Pretzels.  If you aren't drooling yet, I feign to say there might be something wrong with your salivary glands or taste-buds.    I want to head back sometime to soon to try their beer, TV dinner night, and enjoy a table with some good friends.  I'm a fan Angels!!",

We shared the Big Guppy fish tacos, the Brewlee burger, and for dessert we took an order of salted caramel chocolate chip cookies to go. Everything was delicious. Our server was very friendly and took the time to give us info on the food and some of their beers. They said our wait would be 45 minutes but it ended up only being 20. It was definitely worth the wait.   For two entrees(which had plenty of food), 2 beers, and dessert our check was $39.00.   The only negatives... it is very loud inside, not a big waiting area, which could be an issue if it is cold or hot outside, and not a very big place, which means you're more than likely going to wait during peak hours.   We will definitely return soon!",

Service was friendly and available but not overbearing, which I always appreciate.   PS - house made pop tarts intrigued me, but mango covered in caramel is hardly \"seasonal\" in December.

No problem... we'll just sit at the bar. The guy at the bar (we'll call him lumberjack) was helpful and allowed us to try a beer before we made a decision. We liked the bar, it was comfortable and friendly.   The beer... I love the selections. There is a constant rotation of what is on tap, and the prices aren't bad at all. I supposed the chalkboard style menu can be a bit confusing, but it could be worse. Beats printing out new menus every day.  I got the rodeo burger with extra bacon. HOMERUN. So awesome... the fries very were good, I liked the ketchup substitute they serve... it fit the meal perfectly. I left with a happy stomach!  We eventually moved to a table once our group showed up. Again, stuck up hipster dude wasn't much help. I picked the table I wanted when he couldn't find any words to use.   Our server was soft spoken and reports from the other side of the table were that he was a bit drunk (based on smell). He did his job well though. We got our orders and drinks refilled. Functional alcoholics don't bother me too much.   My friend loves this place and I can see why, I'll be back for many more visits.",

    "text": "I am sold the flights of beer!  6 samples of craft beers in one setting will sell me every time.  Exploring craft beers can be a tricky game...we've all ordered a beer that didn't fit our palette and you have to WORK your way thru it.  I explored 3 styles of beers I'd never tried and then finished with 3 favorites to satisfy the taste buds.  There was a nice variety of food on the menu.  They have an interesting take on wings with the sauce on the side. Tried one of the salads which was tasty, but left you a little hungry...especially since it was the same price as the wings.  That moved us onto the Sweet Potato Tacos, which area little more like empanadas, but really tasty with a pesto dipping sauce.  Living in the southwest for so long I'd like to some type of hot sauce on the table or a homemade concoction to bring the heat.  The noise is a little loud, but they'll get the acoustics figured out.  The openness of the floor plan and windows will make it a great year round place for a pint.  It's smack dab in the middle of the Evans Churchill district which is great for a pub crawl",

I like to try new beers and have never left this place without trying 4 or 5 new ones (via the flights, not full pints - otherwise this would be a review of how nice the toilets are to barf into).  Their burgers are heavenly, their desserts are rad and I can't express enough my longing for their chipotle ranch. I would fill a Camelback full of that stuff and hike Camelback mountain with it, if it wasn't so frowned upon by my doctor.  If you've never been, check this place out. Good food, beer and service. If you really like beer and chipotle ranch, stay very far away because you may never escape.",

The outside seating area is nice, you can find shade or bask in the sun. The food is solid. We've experienced the flat bread and wings and would recommend both.  We come to the Phoenix area once a year and could definitely see this place as a yearly tradition to visit. The only weird thing about it is the entrance to the restaurant - it doesn't look like one. Our first visit we did a lap around the building before trying the nondescript door. Can't wait to visit again!",

I needed a sec to look at the taplist. It was tough to read them all so I checked Taphunter. They had poured the last of a dunkel I wanted to order, but the bartender suggested a witbier substitute, and it was good.  They had some tasty-sounding specials, but I ordered the Brewlee burger with fries, and it was solid. The meat was cooked well, and the carmelized sugar on the burger added something unique. Fries were well-seasoned and crispy. The dipping sauce that came with it was odd. It tasted like a strange attempt at ketchup, like a salty and sweet bloody mary mix.  Maybe slightly more than brewpub prices: I paid $25 or so after tax and tip for a burger and one beer. The atmosphere here wasn't what I expected; it was definitely more happening and a lot of people were there to drink. I guess I anticipated something a bit more chill, but no matter. They clearly do a booming business.",

I get it, it can be a busy place but still sometimes it can be annoying. The food is decent, we usually just get appetizers. Wings and fries never disappoint. My latest visit, the food came out really quickly even though it was a busy Saturday night.

The staff seated us promptly and we had a chance to look around at the pretty standard Oak table decor, with a jukebox machine thrown in \"just because.\"   Since we were waiting we went ahead and looked at the board for our flight selection. For those that don't know what a \"flight\" is, you choose 6 beers and they serve them all at once in glasses. Simply put, it's a beer tasting except you drink it all. I order all the strongest beer on the menu because...I'm dead inside and have nothing better to do.  They also make home made poptarts which of course I had to try. The poptart comes with a bowl of vanilla ice cream as well. For some odd reason it took like 30 minutes for my poptart to come and another 10 for them to bring the ice cream after I reminded the waitress after one of her long disappearing acts.  I seriously couldn't finish the flight, but it was great! My stomach was so full of liquor and food from the night I could only finish 3.5 glasses (and just sipped the rest.)  Overall, good quality and they give you value for your alcohol consumption. My friends even found a beer that they've been searching for a vendor back in Chicago for months now since we visited this place! Would love to try a couple flights next time.  4 out of 5 stars",

We also had a flight of six beers. They were great. My favorite was the cranberry cider. I'm not a beer drinker but I do like coders. I was impressed with the flight though. Overall great atmosphere.

I liked that they had a variety of beers on tap but there were really only about three choices from what I know I like already, but there were still some we had never heard of which was intriguing.  None of us were really too hungry but we ordered three appetizers for four of us and most of it was eaten. I didn't order the hummus because it was chipotle, but my friend did. They seemed to like it. I got the chips and salsa that came with beans and the chips were really good. The salsa was too hot for me and I ate all of the beans. Another friend got the sausage platter which was interesting and I loved all the sauce options on their plate.  Our waiter never really offered us another chance to order a full glass of beer or anything else for that matter, so we headed out. He fully didn't deserve the tip that was left for him. Not really sure why anyone would leave $17 on a $43 bill, but I guess I have to be happy I wasn't paying, or the waiter should be. lol",

We had to wait 20 mins while they scrambled to put another table together (not a big deal).   Once seated we had to wait 35 mins for someone to come to our table. I believe we had to wait for the next shift to start for our table to be served. Granted they were busy but 35 minutes is crazy.  After everyone arrived I ordered appetizers for the table instructing the server I will be paying for the apps and my drinks. The rest are separate tabs...she said, \"no problem!\" Then comes the bill...to me for the whole table. The server rarely came to our table for service let alone bothering to drop peoples checks. So after all is said and done I'm stuck with a large bill for her incompetence.   On the bright side the food was very good.",

My first impression of the beer list wasn't all too positive. I was expecting some more local AZ breweries on the list, but rather a lot of the beers were also distributed in San Diego. Oh well. After striking up a convo with the bartender, he did provide (2) local selections - Peoria DIPA and Phoenix Pale. Both were good choices!   Moving on to food, the wife and I split the flatbread and wings. Here is where Angels Trumpet really shined! Delicious food at a reasonable price! How can you go wrong?

I'm used to beer gardens like Yard House and was thrilled to find a place that has beers on tap from local breweries to beers from states like Utah, Colorado, California and Hawaii here.  I started off my Sunday with beers with Khoa N. and an order of \"The Mess\" aka poutine. The server was really helpful in helping me pick out a beer, I was feeling like having a Belgian and I concluded with a Belgian Rye Ale from Borderlands, Arizona. Crisp, light, with a bit of bitterness at the end it was refreshing and oh-so-delicious with my mammoth plate of poutine. The poutine was hands down the best I've had (though I've never been to Canada to rightly judge). The fries were seasoned well, great texture, turkey gravy was rich and homey and the cheese curds oozed with the heat of the gravy. Not that's a mess I can deal with! The portion was huge, enough to feed 4 as an appetizer!  The server who helped us was great, gave awesome recommendations and checked back on us frequently. The atmosphere is casual, effortless and reminiscent of many of the restaurants in Seattle- think wood grain, black and open ceiling.  The brews, the food and the service is awesome. Two thumbs up for carrying local brews! I'm all for supporting local businesses. Khoa N. and I inhaled as much food as we could and downed our beer leaving our bellies full and left happily!",

Clean newer outdoor indoor seating. Solid rotating selection of 30 or so beers. Some food is unique and clever. Crowd can be a bit dooshy on most nights. Days can be better, like on a Sunday afternoon. It's not just the ASU influence. Service is weak. Kind of a hipster aloof arrogance to too much of the staff. Yes when crowded the ambience is uncomfortable. The noise is like a crowded dive bar but the environment doesn't match. Parking can be difficult but it is downtown area. For the pricing, the experience should be much better. Owners probably making enough to not notice the management flaws now, but eventually these growing problems will catch up.",

The cons., this place is just like every other hipster ale house in town, so it's unforgettable.  It also smelled like spilled beer as soon as you walk in.  Once we seated ourselves, I ordered one of their claims to fame; the homemade pop-tart.  It tasted pretty good, for not tasting anything like a pop-tart and as long as you don't look at the grey mush inside.  Bottom line, don't expect anything special from this place.  The food is fine and the atmosphere is fine.  If you're in the area, not the worst choice, but not the best.",

My husband and I drank a beer or two and then turned to the menu.  It's fairly simple fare, but boy do they put a spin on it.  The sandwiches each of us ordered were unique and very very tasty.  The home made potato chips are divine, and my husband was really pleased that his coleslaw was delicious and the portion was large (unlike so many places that give you a tiny amount of  your side dish).  My only suggestion would be that the beers be offered in a larger size.  It was explained to us that, due to the alcohol content, the beer is served in a smaller glass - but it was a little frustrating to hubby to not get a larger amount ---the beer is THAT good.  Keep up the good work, Angels Trumpet Ale House.  We'll be back.",

If you like beer, you'll love what's available here.  The food selection is unexpected, and unexpectedly good.   The fries are a hit, the flatbreads are great, the variety of quirky or unexpected takes on what I'll call Suburban Kid Soul Food are creative, fun, and delicious.  That said, I particularly like the hummus because it has a bigger sesame hit than any I've ever had, and I like that.  I'd give the place 4 stars easy for these points alone.    However...  - On the negative side.  Parking is almost nonexistent.  The place closes at midnight even on weekends.  And the staff has some standout nice and helpful folks, but balances out overall at somewhat aloof, dragged down by the likes of Tessa, she of the bitchy body language and poorly hidden eye-rolling.   Net/net, the place is entertaining, but seems kind of clubby, and if you're not in the club, your presence will merely be accomodated.  Maybe even with a smile.  But you're taking up space that could otherwise be used by club members...whoever they are.",

    "text": "Pros - Great beer selection, constantly changing, and you can tell the owners have a serious passion for the topic.   Beer Flight from anything on the board is a tasty treat for experienced beer drinkers, or a nice way for less serious drinkers to explore.  The food was good.   The building itself is interesting on the inside, and has a fun vibe overall.  Yay for a new place in downtown Phoenix, especially next to the great FilmBar!  Cons - The servers don't seem to know much about the beer. We had to order by number because our server was so confused. This might get fixed with experience and training, but I would expect an \"alehouse\" to at least nail this out of the gate.  The menu has some glitches yet, which our server warned us about. It took multiple trips to the kitchen to figure out which food they had/didn't have. Kind of took the fun out of trying to pair our beers with our meals.  Main building was so noisy we could barely hear anyone our table. Outside wasn't an option because it was pitch black. So if you go at night, you get to see or hear everyone else in your party, but probably not both.  Parking Lot is a trap. We watched seven cars in a row pull in, realize there was nowhere to go, then back out onto the street to find street parking. Surprised there was no accident.  In spite of being told no smoking on the patio, several people were smoking and none of the servers or managers seemed to care. So is smoking allowed or not? Who knows. Mildly annoying by itself, but I think an example of the bigger problem that not everyone here is on the same page yet. Your visit will likely vary widely depending on when you go and who takes care of you.  I had an okay time, but have no desire to return. Giving them 3 stars because I love their idea and love to see something new downtown, and hope others try them out while they work to raise their game.",

    "text": "When thinking about writing my review, I was going to give them 2 or 3 stars... only because THE BEER HERE IS AMAZING. I've been here 5 times now and have loved every beer I've tried. If you're a beer lover, you can't go wrong here. Great selection/variety for anyone!  I mean, 31 craft DRAFT beers in one place in DT PHX... done and done! Even if you're not a beer aficionado, tell your server what you like and they'll make suggestions as to what you should try, AND are always spot-on. Last time I was there I had the Stone Enjoy By IPA... one of my new favorite beers of all time.  Now of the 5 times here, 2 times my party has ordered food. The first time I did not like my sandwich at all, and my husband thought his was okay.  I liked the names and ideas but felt it was executed poorly.   The second time here we started at one table with a handful of people and had Jake as our server (we've had him in other DT PHX restaurants and he rocks -- as always). Jake is great, friendly, knowledgeable, quick, honest... just an all around awesome guy. Then our party grew and we cashed out and took a table outside. It got busy, we got ignored for the better part of half an hour -- but then when we finally saw our new server he was very attentive going forward. Our food was delayed and we felt there was a lack of HONEST communication. Honest meaning don't tell me the food is coming right now then come out another 40 minutes later and tell me the same thing, just tell me how it is. Our server finally got a manager involved (Waylan - sp?) and let me tell you, he was our saving grace. He communicated the issue and was quick to fix it. It was to the point that we were talking about never going in again and he changed our minds. Our food came out after he got involved, it was great, everyone was super attentive to us (we weren't looking to be babied, that's now how I roll).  I know it's frustrating when something goes wrong and you don't have much control over it but you as a manager/server get the brunt of the angry guests.  So over all, my experience at this place has went from meh, to oh no never again, to great, thanks to the customer service provided by the management team. We'll be in again soon for a delicious beer  or five, and I will give Waylan a high five when I see him, and we'll ask to sit in Jake's section. :)",

And I know it gets a lot of complaints about being overly loud, but give me a freaking break people...it's a BAR! To me, there's nothing worse than going to a quiet, empty bar. My typical reaction is to turn around and walk out. So when I saw that this place is almost always busy, I was down to try it out. I also liked the crowd of people inside...nobody overly snobby or snooty. I think it's the perfect place to stop by for a drink or two with friends. If you're looking for a cozy, date night out, then this is not the place to go. But I will definitely be back to experience a lively night on the town. And I can't wait to try out their patio during the cooler months!",

    "text": "I wish there was a 2.5 rating on here. Let me start with the positive our server was super awesome and knowledgeable about beer as well as really friendly. If I were to rate the place strictly on the service it would be an easy 5 star review, however there were some things that just didn't measure up.    We found a table outside and the weather was perfect, so that was a plus. We proceeded to order a \"flight\" of beer. Which was 6 different samples of selections from the 25 plus handles that are rotated frequently (I think daily, but I could be wrong on that). Here is the first part of the reason for the 2 stars. There are 2 boards to read the selection of draughts that are being featured, and a menu that describes what each of the types of beers are for example  A \"Lager\" is..... or A \"Stout\" is..... However there is no correlation that I could decipher that would tell you what \"type\" of beer that the featured name stood for, so let's say number 22 on the board was Witte...If you are a beer rookie there was no way to know what type it was. This causes one of at least two dilemmas, you can either 1. ask the server what type of beer each of the 25 or so types are (which....\"Ain't nobody got time for that\" :)  or you can play a little \"Russian Beerlette\" and just hope for the best, at any rate there are some specific types of beer that I just do not enjoy, and I didn't want the server to have to reel off all of the specifics of each beers that was on the board. I love the idea of the constantly rotating types of draught, but they need to figure out a better delivery system for the patron. The other part of the review was based on the appetizers that we had, one of which was the pretzels. Maybe I am americanized and have been spoiled to food a certain way, but I like my pretzels soft all the way through and really doughy (if that's a word) and theirs just weren't that. The pretzels were not very moist and the selection of cheese and mustard was ok at best. I really hate giving two stars, but I gotta be honest about my experience.  Great concept, great server, poor execution....I might try again in a few months and see if they changed anything.",

It appeared on my credit card statement as $22.21.  There is no way that they could mistake 17 for 22 and no way a $7 tip on 2 beers delivered slowly is appropriate.

The patio ambiance was beautiful at night looking at the top of the skyline, waitstaff and bartender folk were very sweet and genuine.  I didn't know that the Film Bar's directly across the street from it. Ya vohl, I'll be back!",

I'm really glad that I got to come back as a beer snob after living in San Diego for a while. Because breweries are scarce in the Phoenix area, Angel's Trumpet is the perfect place to try local beers. There were even some from other states that I had wanted to try. We were able to try 2 flights and then ordered pints of the ones we loved. My favorite of this visit was the Bread Pudding beer from Huss. It was delicious.   We were more than satisfied with our visit and the servers were helpful during our beer selections. If you're in Phoenix and you love beer... Go to Angel's Trumpet!",

It can occasionally be busy but most of the time I've found somewhere to sit quickly.  The burgers are all good, the pizzas are great and the poptarts are a good enough reason to go.  They have a lot of great beer on tap and it's not all your standard fare. Any beer snob would be able to find something worth drinking. They also have a small selection of wine on tap, however the red wine on tap is chilled which I'm not personally fan of, though I know that's popular atm.  All in all I would recommend it!",

The revolving draught selection makes each visit unique. On top of that, the kitchen provides both fun (TV dinners, anyone?) and trendy takes on traditional dishes.  The big sell to AngelsTrumpet is the thirty ever-changing beer options. As soon as a keg is tapped, a new and often drastically different brew replaces it. I have some bars to go to for \"the usual\" and I have Angels Trumpet to explore lesser known breweries.  I have on multiple occasions also gone with the beer flight. Given the vastness of the beer board and my own unfamiliarity with smaller breweries, for a very reasonable price you can order six three-ounce beers.   The beer and atmosphere speak for themselves. Have a drink at the bar, at the table, or outside on an Adirondack chair. You can't go wrong!",

(For example, I ordered their Casper flatbread the other day, which comprises salami, rosemary, leeks, goat cheese, and a drizzle of honey. Sounds intoxicatingly good, right? They layered no less than 35 slices of salami on that single flatbread, so that you can't even see the flatbread itself. On top, they crumbled a full container's worth of goat cheese--the two flavors were so overpowering that I felt nauseous for the rest of the night, had the rest for leftovers the next day, and felt nauseous all over again.)  What I CAN commend are their homemade, seasonal Poptarts. These things are to die for, particularly their pineapple IPA variety (the strawberry-banana was...meh).  Lastly, their selection of brews is top-notch for this area of downtown, and also for this level of character--although the interior is extremely crowded and loud at virtually all times (whereas their patio feels like a fenced-off parking lot in...well, the middle of downtown Phoenix), I'd take Angels' beer selection and atmosphere over the wider selection and nonexistent atmosphere at the Yard House.",

They also have this thing where you can order a flight of 6 beers of your choosing (about 6 oz. each) for $9 if you're undecided on which beer to get.  It comes in a muffin pan.  I ordered the animal burger in beef (you can get it in chicken and pork too), medium-rare.  It was a little overcooked, but still juicy and damn tasty.  The pickled grilled onions went fantastically with the bacon.  The fries were a disappointment because some were soggy and the 'ketchup' sauce on the side tasted like spaghetti sauce.  Our server (Ashley was her name if my beer-impaired memory is not mistaken - she has tats on her calves) was attentive, fast and nice.  Easily found a table here pre-Spring break on a weekday.  Best part of the meal: drunken public cornhole (not what you're thinking - get your mind out of the gutter people).  Otherwise, known as bean bag tossing (ok, seriously, you need to see a psychiatrist if you're still looking for a sexual innuendo).  Loser for each round drinks a shot of beer, making the game everso difficult as time passed by.",

Denying myself some beer from the nitro taps at Angels has been agony so I came back in against my best judgement.  I sat at the bar for a while before the bartender acknowledged me, no biggie, I was narrowing down my selection anyway.  I started to become annoyed though when he kept pouring tasters to the people next to me without even acknowledging me.  Finally, I get my taste of the beer I want to try and it's this little tiny pour that couldn't fill a thimble much less my mouth.  I thought to myself \"is this really happening, why is this guy being such a d!ck to me.\"  I looked over at my neighbors taste glasses and he was pouring them half way. I tell myself to let it go, it's only a taste, just get your beer and move on.  But I couldn't get my beer, no. I had to sit there and listen to the customer next to me tell the bartender about all the beers in Germany she has tried. When that long winded b!tch took a breath I stole my chance to order a beer. He looked at me very annoyed and nodded his head and continued his conversation.  Then he continues to pour more tasters for the people he is having a conversation with.  Did you get that?  A paying customer tried to order a beer and instead he poured his friends more freebies.  I walked out.  When I was leaving I saw a gentleman that looked like he was important, I asked him if he was in charge and he said he was. I informed him his bartender was a d!ck to me and he apologized for him.    Thank you for that apology, good sir.  You have a really great establishment and I want your product but their are barriers keeping me from getting it. Please get rid of your staff, hire people who know about customer service and let me tweak the decor to make it more comfortable.  Do that and you'll have a loyal customer for life.",

Tonight I had Chef Brian's chile relleno \"TV Dinner\" at Angels Trumpet that officially takes the cake as the BEST chile relleno I've ever had.  No joke.  So good, in fact, that once I'm finished, I should pay my cheque, walk straight into the kitchen and shoot the cook.  Why?  Because this chile relleno was so good that I fear it is upsetting the balance of the universe and that's what I do; I restore balance to this universe.  Although it was Mexican to eat, I was in the mood for a Belgian and after a long process of consideration, ended up taking my server, Brendan's, suggestion and ordered the Affligem Brouwerij, a Belgian Tripel.  This ended up being a PERFECT suggestion for both my beer mood and pairing with the delicious food.    I have never been disappointed with Angels Trumpet and will continue to go there until my level of satisfaction is severly compromised.  I assume that will be approximately never.",

    "text": "Walk into Angels Trumpet House and it feels like you've left Phoenix and entered a city like SF's establishment. At least that's what I think. The vibe here is very cool, urban, indie, and just simply brewtastic. It's brewtastic because they serve just about every cool beer you can think of.   It's a very open environment with long tables and a spacious patio. Music plays over the loud pseaker, beer flavors line the walls and a large bar top welcomes guests to take a seat. Between the atmosphere and beer selection, if you like beer this is your place. It's also right across the street from Filmbar so a great stop before or after your indie film!",

Great vibe of a locals haunt, but you get this pretentious hipster vibe from the waitstaff who take 15 minutes before you see them for the first time, then it's like pulling teeth to get them to come back.there is a fine line of bugging the shit out of people and giving them their space to enjoy them self, but they go to the extreme end of practically ignoring you.  I'm very empathetic to the service industry because I grew up in it, but if you expect people to give you a good tip, much less even return, you need to be attentive and engaging. I'd been 5-6 times bc I love the atmosphere, microbrew and great food, but after the continued attempt at giving them another chance and the same result from the waitstaff...I'm no longer going to waste my time or money.",

I would suggest sticking to the beer if your'e a wine snob; it is, after all, an ale house.  The empanada I tried was pretty tasty. Wings are nicely portioned but I'm not sure if the accompanying sauces matched very well. I also had a few bites of the sausage platter, which was hit or miss. Service was very slow. I gauge slow service by jokingly contemplating a \"dine-and-dash.\" I would never actually do it, but when I keep thinking about it, a server somewhere doesn't want to take our money. So overall, ATAH didn't leave a great impression but I'm willing to give it another chance.",

I plan to do that again.  I don't think my evening would have been nearly as enjoyable sitting indoors, as there seems to be nothing to absorb the sound.  Waitress was a little slow getting around, and we had to wait a bit for our tab.   I will be returning for a social event this week, hopefully I'll be able to have a 4 or 5 star experience, in which case I'll upgrade my rating.",

So far we've had the \"outlaw\" burger, the ? burger the one with the fried egg on it, the flatbreads, the sausage snack, the pop tarts, the dessert flatbread, and the salad (the one with avocado). I didn't like the fries but my wife loved them. I loved the cole slaw...vinegar and oil dressing not mayo. We went on TV Dinner night (Tuesday)...fried chicken dinner - excellent.  We've asked them to \"customize\" things like the salad and they accommodated us 'no questions asked' happy to make us happy.   The beer selection is excellent ...on the downside, when the keg is empty, they move on to the next one. So we had the Scotch Ale (great!!) in the beginning of the week, but on our return it was gone...we were forced into another discovery ...we tried one of their 6 glass samplers...we picked the 6, and discovered a new \"favorite!\"   The clientele is a mix, old, young, casual, professional. Tables and chairs are basic but comfortable, inside or out on the patio.   Depending on the beverages ordered we've been out the door for $30-$50 for two of us on each of the 3 visits.",

The menu is unique, they make their own catsup and that's interesting. good meat plates and good veggie plates. I'm positive you'll leave here with a smile. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is that most of the waiters/waitresses I've had were just not up to par in speed and friendliness that you would expect from a place like this. There was just some excitement missing from them.",

If beers aren't your thing, let me tell you about the food. It's all delicious. All of it. They make everything from scratch (and I'm talking even the ketchup), so you really can't go wrong. They serve gastropub favorites like wings, sliders and hot pretzels, but they are in no way typical. For dessert they have sea salt + chocolate chip cookies and HOME MADE POP TARTS. The proprietors are lovely people who are dedicated to bringing you the best brew and best foods. The patio is big and comfortable; bring your entire contact list. You'll be a hero.",

That's right, every Tuesday, pop on over to Angel's Trumpet for a massive, hearty, down-home TV dinner served on an actual compartmentalized tray filled with good old fashioned comfort food.   If that brand of gluttony isn't your thing, try any of the sandwiches and you'll be totally satisfied-- the food here is a major highlight, no question.    I'm a wine person so the place gets one demerit for the very limited (and usually not-so-tasty) wine selection.  But because it is billed as an \"ale house\" I can't get too picky about it.  My beer-guzzling family raves about the beer selection and the flights that let you try a little bit of everything.  If they're happy with it, it must be grand!    The atmosphere is my favorite thing about the place.  The lighting is perfect, it's spacious but cozy, and there are a variety of seating options including a great outdoor space.  It's great for small gatherings and large happy hour outings alike.     A few words of advice:  1.  TV dinners start at 6pm and they are limited quantity so don't expect to show up for a late dinner and nab one-- they'll be sold out!  2.  ATAH is closed on Mondays!   3.  They don't open until 3pm Tuesday-Thursday so don't expect to grab lunch or an early happy hour during the week.    Cheers!",

The service- Almost always painful, and painful to watch around me, especially at an outside table. Pretty slow, negligent, and they don't seem to care. The strangest thing is nearly every time I have been here, I have been asked to close out so the server can \"get their drink on, too.\" Multiple occasions, all different servers. Were they trained to say this? I get it, but it's also a bit lame.   If you're really lucky, the bar service can be a little better.

I was compelled to try this place because of all the awesome things I have heard about this place and I feel a little compelled to give them a great review . . . maybe I missed something but this place is a hair better than mediocre.  Meal:  I had one of the hamburgers and their version of poutine.  I also had a few of the craft beers.  Taste:  The hamburger was almost tremendous.  I asked for medium rare and came out a hair under well done, but other than that, it was spectacular.  The poutine was very good too . . . maybe not Canadian great but very good. 7 out of 10.  Value:  I thought the highlight of the meal was the portions.  I couldn't finish my burger and poutine.  I came hungry and the prices were more than reasonable. 4 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  Service was extremely slow and the waitress had little to no fucks to give regarding doing her job well.  She botched our order twice.  Rarely came over to check up on drinks where on two or three different occasions I had to flag down another waitress.  She had no clue what was on the menu.  But her beer knowledge was about the same as a 18 year old walking into his first fraternity party and asking for a natty ice.  I would imagine if you work at a place with \"ale house\" in the name, you would know a little about the beers.  There are a 25+ beers on tap so I know its a little hard but for Christ sakes, at least know 4 or 5 really well.  4 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  Decent.  Nothing so special that it left a lasting impression.  3 out of 5.   Overall:  Will I go back?  Probably but only if every other option has been exhausted.  Hopefully the service improves by then . . . 18 out of 30 points, 2 out of 5 stars.",

It had the perfect amount of citrus, was lighter on the tummy than say a Blue Moon or Shocktop; the typical Wheat beers that are available at most restaurants.   The temperature of the beer was perfect. Staff was very knowledgeable about the beer selection, which changes every day. Actually, after my glass of Tangerine Wheat, they had just ran out and replaced it on the giant chalk board display with a new wheat selection, it was called Heife WEISS Hell!

I really loved the open design, the back patio (especially between October and May) are perfect for this part of Phoenix.  It's like, for a moment, you forget where you are.  Very zen like, and peaceful place to enjoy a drink - at least until they get busy, and then it's still great, just not as quiet.  MUST TRY if you're needing a drink downtown, I will surely be back.",

The staff is always extremely competent and knowledgeable about beer, though they don't small-talk much as the place is almost always packed! The owners are consistently there working along side their staff, and they take a lot of time to speak with regulars and make sure the service is on-point. The husband/wife team run a tight ship and their love of this business definitely shines through.   If you ask me, the only problem with the place is that the inside chairs are pretty uncomfortable, but I usually sit at the bar so it doesn't really matter.   This is the type of business that helps a city grow and gain character. A beautiful, clean, professional place with good service at a great price. I'll always be coming back.",

First, this is one of those fun hip (yeah I realize using that word may make people question eating here but don't.) places just off downtown. It has a huge beer selection that cover a broad spectrum of tastes from a variety of brewers.   Second, the food here is great. In the past I've had wings and several sandwiches, all exceeding expectations. Today, was no different.   I have 5 words for you: bbq beef brisket grilled cheese! What more could you ask for! The brisket was tender and juicy and the sauce was not overpowering. The cheese was gooey and perfectly melted me it was served on thick white bread, grilled perfectly to be crunchy on the outside but soft inside. Plus it soaked up all the sauce so nothing was lost. It truly was a delicious sandwich. Now I got the coleslaw today and unlike a traditional slaw, this was a oil and vinegar based slaw but lightly dressed. It had a nice covering of feta which gave a tangy salty finish to each bite, plus had craisins mixed in for a sweet balance to the salty feta.   All in all, lunch was great. Perfect way to break up a Friday.",

We all really enjoyed our meals (oddly we all got mexican: guppy (fish tacos), chet burrito and verde tacos). All were excellent. There was one item of our meal that was hugely disappointing however. There was a specials menu and Thursdays was tater tots. Not something we'd normally order, but for some reason it just sounded good to all of us. First off, there were no prices. This always annoys me when restaurants don't put prices on a menu. We asked the waitress who 'thought' they were $8, but assured us it was a big basket. They were small, but tasty, and for our party of 4 we'd guess we each got about 5 tater tots. She was right, it was a big basket, unfortunately there were hardly any tater tots in it.",

Breweries are pretty ubiquitous in Tempe and they don't RUN OUT of anything. Does this make you think that the beer you're enjoying is some how more exclusive? No...it means they don't have room for extra kegs, because they took up the only available slab of real estate in the Arts District.  Also, pretty sure that grandiose sense of self, that the staff possess, has gotten passed down the patrons...  It's a place to people watch and \"been seen\".

I had a glass of their rose wine and ordered their salad that came with avocados, grapefruit, beets, mint, arugula, goat cheese, and a orange vinaigrette. I asked them to leave off the grapefruit, beets, and add salami. I thoroughly enjoyed it, wow! However, the second time I had it, I ordered it the exact same way (but for take-out instead), and when I ate it, it was way too tart. I could barely eat it which stunk because I was really looking forward to having it again. Other than that, i liked the environment.

Our server knew a lot about beer and we each gave him a description of what we liked and he picked beer for us. It was awesome! He clearly likes his job and is very good at it. They also have a neat way of doing flights, they have a piece of paper with 6 circles on it. You put the number of the beer you want to try in each circle (and there are like 30+ choices.....ah mazing!). They bring out the six fairly large sample sizes in a muffin tin (cute idea!). We got two flights and tried some crazy beers...a lot of beers none of us had ever tried before. It was also cool that the beers were changing throughout the night...like when one keg ran out, they replaced it with something totally new. We didn't have any food, but it smelled and looked good. The ambiance is comfortable...they have an open wall out to the outside and tables throughout. It is a large bar and has plenty of seating. I will definitely be back!",

Chicken was really good, a tad dry (but this is likely due to smoking then grilling) and the veggies were spot on delicious and a great variety of carrots, parsnips, and butternut squash.  They meant seasonal and took it seriously....and seasoned them well too!   Pricing: Food--everything was about under $15; flight of beer $9....good prices in my  book. Space:  Looks great!  Very modern and clean, but the outstanding use of wood butcherblock furniture and what appears to be upcycled wood for wall decor warms the place up. Cons: Not a lot to drink if you aren't drinking beers. No coffee, no club soda, no iced tea.  Only offer a handful of wines. They do have a soda fountain somewhere.  I get it. It's a craft brew pub.  No mixed drinks. Only serve the frothy and fermented.  I support that.  But have some decent non-alcoholic bevvys on hand: iced tea, sparkling waters, and good coffee.  You don't need an espresso bar, just a good machine with a high-quality bean, and someone who knows how to make that work.    I'll go back!",

Each time I've taken a seat at the bar and have had to flag down the bartender to ask for a menu and ask for a another round all while there has been only a handful of people in the place. I know that they've only been open a couple of months but this place needs to fix these issues if it's going to stick around. Come off your prices at least a buck for each specific pour and offer a happy hour. You're in the wrong locale to command such high prices.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to their opening and now I feel I need to wait a few months longer before I try again.    On a Friday night, a hostess/server greeted us after a good 5 minutes of waiting by the door and asked us if we would be ordering food since the kitchen was backed up.  If we were to order, our food would arrive well over an hour of our arrival.  Naturally, this was all the information we needed enough to say \"No, we're just here for a beer or two.\"  Soon after, we were seated and placed an order for 3 pints.  We waited a good 15-20 minutes for our beers.  During that time, we noticed lots of servers standing around one POS (point of sale).  It looked as if servers were waiting in line to put in their individual orders.  Our suspicion was confirmed later that evening, only one working POS.  I wonder why they didn't have a backup plan-paper tickets?  I would think people would be more inclined to walk out on their tab because of the excruciating wait than management have to worry about losing money with paper tickets.  Our waters were refilled twice before our first round of beers arrived at our table.  Two of my buddies call this place the \"Water House\" because that's all they got when they visited Angel's Trumpet Ale House.    Once we received our beers, we asked her to place another order for another round of beers because we figured that we would receive our 2nd set of beers just as we finished our first ones.  It worked!  If ya plan on having another beer, be sure to place an order as soon as the first beers arrive so that you don't hafta wait long for your second beer.    I think the night was best portrayed by a sneak peek that I got of the owner- he was rubbing his temples and obviously under stress.   I am inclined to give them a star or two more once the timing has improved.    Great building, good ambiance, wonderful patio (hope it's pet friendly), excellent location and a good selection of beers.    Oh, I like the idea of three bathroom choices instead of the typical two.",

    "text": "I cannot speak for the food, (though the menu looked unique and tantalizing), but the beer selection was great, as was service. We arrived on Saturday night, the first weekend Angels Trumpet was open, around 10 p.m. for drinks. There was a large group of us, 9 people... though there weren't any tables to accomodate our party we were able to stand/be seated comfortably around one of the high-tops.  This place is great for smaller parties who enjoy a good beer. The selection cannot be beat in downtown Phoenix -- 31 craft brews on tap of every taste and style... and they're always rotating. I had the Biere Blonde & White... 4.5% alcohol, light, sunny taste. Reminded me of Four Peak's SunBrew.  The selection ranges from hoppy IPAs at 10% alcohol/volume to the lighter, summer brews and everything in between. There is literally something for everyone, even a few wines on tap for the non-beer drinkers.  Our server was very nice and accommodating.. and though the place was packed she got us our drinks pretty quickly.  A couple reasons I didn't give Angels Trumpet the perfect '5' star rating:  Disorganization-- Seating was sort of a nightmare... and we kind of waited around for one of the high-tops to open up and just snagged it. Ambience-- I enjoyed the nice, open floor plan but the restaurant-style and dozens of tables/chairs was a bit puzzling considering the kitchen was closed when we arrived. I couldn't hear any music above the conversations in the room and the huge, 60\" TV screens weren't turned on. It'd be nice for weekend nights to boast something a little more special. If you're going to close the kitchen, allow people to walk around and mingle more.  Overall, if you're looking for a nice place to kick back with a small group of friends and try some awesome, unique beers on tap, Angels Trumpet is it. Their prices are reasonable for the quality offered. Haven't tried the food, but the menu is pretty diverse offering a spin on traditional bar food like flatbread pizzas and sandwiches.",

Not quite full yet but within 20 minutes the place was full and the patio was too. People really like this place. The beer was good, I got a cider and it was very tasty. We weren't THAT hungry so we split the Meat Treat  pizza and it was BOMB. The bacon was nice and crunchy and the veggies weren't slimy or overwhleming like they tend to be on flat bread pizza.

We peddled on over to Angels Trumpet Ale House and noticed a BOATLOAD of bicycles chained together at Angels Trumpet Ale House and across the street at FilmBar's bike rack.  I think they need a larger bike rack... like a large parking lot sized bike rack.  I was worried when I first walked in because there were many people standing at the entrance... but we got right in and were seated (this was a little before 9 on a Friday).    I liked the energy of the place... and how excited the imbibers seemed, however I'm torn... I want to rate it a full four, but then I thought of the loudness and also the \"ok\" food.  I wasn't looking for an intimate evening with my man, but yes, I realized I was shouting after a while.  I saw the overwhelmingly large selection of craft brews on the large chalk board... and really neat looking taps.  I went up to the board and figured out which ones I wanted and got a flight.  I don't drink tons of beer... but I enjoy craft brews.  I did take a peek at their wine selection and was disappointed to see no local wines.  This is a running disappointment for me... but that's for another rant.  But I made my selections and we got a taco appetizer.  The tacos were okay... but the chimichuri was REALLY good.  I found a new love... I REALLY liked the Hazelnut beer.  I'm definitely going back for that one.  I picked a few that weren't totally to my liking... but others that were.  I really like trying a few different flavors.    We ordered the white flatbread pizza... which was a little better than okay.  I don't think it was bad, I just know that I've had better flatbreads in downtown.  Not to say I won't have another... or I won't try some other food there... I've just had better.  So  I'd probably give this a 3.5, because I want to support anything downtown.  I think there are some kinks that need to be worked out... nothing horrendous.  I'm glad to see more local businesses down here.  It warms my heart.  Yay downtown!",

There was a very small wait but we were super lucky to score a spot at the bar while we waited. We were very impressed with the 30+ beers that they had available on tap. We appreciated that each beer had an explanation of the type it was as well. The bartenders were very gracious and even offered samples of beer too. Both beers that I had were completely delicious and the amount I got exceeded my expectations. I believe they were 16 ounces a piece. Our friends also kept telling us about how delicious the food was. My husband and I each got one of the Sammy's (sandwiches). They did not disappoint! I highly recommend the Matador!! For dessert we tried their homemade pop tart which that night was a bananas foster type. So incredibly delicious, it reminded me of a toaster strudel but gourmet. It was quite a busy night and we did have to sit outside, and it was quite warm that night. Hoping to sit inside next time. Will definitely be back to this place!",

The downtown area is a huge contrast to the urban sprawl of the rest of the Phoenix metro area.  We didn't have any food on this visit, but it looked really good.  The beer list was impressive, a good variation in type of beer and brewery location.  I tried the Dragoon 3 Goons Belgian Tripel, The Petrus Aged Red sour ale, and the Founders Porter. They had good music and a lot of seating, including a great outdoor patio.",

Lots of local beers on tap, great food options, and Micah, our server, did an awesome job. He was on it, attentive, and all our guests commented on how great the server was.  Only gripes, parking is a bit tricky, as is any spot in downtown, or along that central corridor. The seating where we were, back, right, next to the windows were a bit hot. It was humid and we were in the sun. But other than that, we had an awesome time. We will definitely be back to try more beers.  Ask for Micah, he rocks!!",

While very busy, it still felt open so you really don't notice it being crowded.  The bar area is tiled in white, which gives it a clean, modern feel. And with 25+ taps most anyone could find a draft they would enjoy. The board also listed wines they have available and the selection appeared to be broad.  The special of the night was a Hawaiian TV dinner which came on a partitioned black tray similar to old style TV dinners. It was a pulled pork sandwich with grilled pineapple and an island inspired BBQ sauce. Sides include a salad with citrus vinaigrette, island style macaroni salad, coconut rice, and a banana cake with cream cheese frosting. All items were excellent.  There was a nice siEd outdoor patio area with abundant misters, but given it was over 110, we opted for inside.  It is worth noting parking is tight, so you might need to park elsewhere and walk in the evening, so an accordingly. Still, this place seems worth the extra effort.  I'll definitely be going back!",

They have a super small parking lot so you will most likely need to park on the street. We were kind of early so there was plenty of parking around when we arrived but it had filled up by the time we left.  There is a huge board behind the bar that lists all of the beers available. While we were there they erased and replaces at least two that I saw so if you see something you want order it! We tried a flight of beers so we could sample multiple. They have a good variety.  My husband had the Outlaw Burger and enjoyed it. I had the BBQ grilled cheese which was very tasty. The fries were also really good. My friend had the Fun-guy flatbread which was also very good.  Even though we were on the full side we decided to split some desert. We ordered the Blueberry pop tart and the salted chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. The pop tart was amazing! Definitely a must order. The cookie was too sweet for me but the guys loved it.  Overall great experience!",

Staff is typically helpful with drink selections and will let you sample!   When I went here I felt like the service was fairly slow for there not being a lot of people in there. I used to go here often in college when I went to ASU. Service was typically the same and kept me away at times. If you're looking for a night of trying some beers and having good bar eats, I suggest checking this downtown spot out!",

I usually get some kind of IPA (recently a 20 year old college kid told me IPAs are for \"old people.\") so I'm still processing that. Anyways! I regained enough pride to order one anyway. The poutine fries and sliders were to die for! The egg on the fries added the perfect salt/savory taste with the curds, gravy, and fries.  For dessert we ordered the famous homemade pop tarts! They really did melt in your mouth and were warm, soft, and the middle was expertly made jelly.   I've only sat out side here but the service I've received has been consistently good with each server providing great menu recommendations. The decor inside is trendy and they have ample bar space. I'll definitely keep coming back!",

Maybe they were recently hired, I'm not sure.  The parking is very limited, most people would probably have to pay for street parking. The area seemed very safe and the architecture was mid-century modern and seemed nicely kept! The bathrooms could probably use a cleaning but I've seen worse!  I enjoyed the Brewlee Burger! It was nice and cooked to medium rare perfectly. We shared both the pretzels and hummus appetizers with family and while good they weren't amazing - I'd definitely try other things.  All in all it was a good place to try! We all walked away happy!",

No one liked your version of any of the dishes. Normally when a restaurant has a very small and limited menu, they knock it out of the park, your servings were just weird. When your menu states \"cooked to order\", maybe you should do that. No one in our group would not only reorder their selection,  everyone agreed that they would not come back.

The Tuesday night tv dinner for that night was beer battered chicken strips with creamy siracha sauce with zucchini fries, green salad, potato salad and smores for a bangin price of 9 bucks! You really cant beat that!  We were sitting out in the patio area and I was checking out the beer board and decided to go with the #25 (?) the peach tree shaker, this was a solid good choice! It was a great tasting beer!  I've been here before and knew I couldn't leave without getting one of their homemade poptarts! The poptart for the night was a tart cherry with dark chocolate drizzle, it was the perfect end to a delish meal!   If you are in the area, you really should give Angels Trumpet Ale House a try, they have a great selection of beers and selection of food!",

Everything I've ordered off the menu has been good. Specifically the sweet potato taquitos are amazing and such a good option since we are vegetarian. I also really love their BBQ pizza flatbread and their sweet chili sauce pizza flatbread.   Not to mention their beer is also awesome, they have so many to choose from and my boyfriend share a flight so we can try a bunch of different ones.   There are a lot of things I haven't tried off their menu that I'm assuming are also just as good. You definitely need to check this place out!",

They have a pretty great selection of beer available which they change daily however, they do not have a formalized beer list but rather provide a chalk board style selection of everything which is a personal pet peeve of mine but... its ok. I would suggest sitting at the bar or a close table if you plan to read it.   ** Updated to 5 stars. Have had amazing experiences since my first review and highly highly recommend their t.v. dinner night on Tuesdays. So good!!!!",

I LOVE the huge selection of beers. I did the sampler, which cost a measly $9 and allowed me to try 6 beers (around 4 oz each). 3 of the beers were great, 3 I hated, but that's the bonus in getting a flight! I also had a sausage sampler with housemade chorizo, some germain sausage and wild boar sausage. All of it was awesome. it was served with housemade ketchup, a fwe mustards, grilled onions and some potatoes. I can't wait to go back and get the same plate. Awesome ambiance, I was suprised how bright and airy the interior was.",

You never know if you'll have to battle a crowd competing for wait staff - or if you'll be blown away by a super knowledgeable, attentive server. Either way, get over it because the atmosphere is awesome - a relaxing, indoor/outdoor, beer lovers haven. As to food, leave judgment at the door and give the spam sliders a chance. I know: Those who grew up on spam are no more anxious to relive childhood trauma. And those who've managed to avoid this long would wonder why start now. Just do it. At least once. It's a novelty done well and a fun food adventure. We also love the flatbreads and TV Tray Tuesday dinners. A great character place to hang out with friends.",

    "text": "I've been to Angels Trumpet House a couple of times and I'm a big fan.  I am already a brewery junkie so this review could be biased.  Angels Trumpet is located in the heart of downtown Phoenix and it's a great alternative eating and drinking option for the area.    I love the ambiance and decor.  It's very hipster, natural in a really good way.  The outdoor patio is amazing and just laid back wooden tables which are perfect for enjoying a delicious brew.  The beer selection is extensive.  They have 20+ unique offerings on tap at any given time.  They are unusual but high quality beers that you won't see at your typical brewery or bar.  I'm an avid craft beer drinker and all of the beer choices are always new to me.  They are written on a chalk board which makes it a little difficult to see from your table.  I suppose that's my biggest complaint.  Having something at your table would help better chose your beer of choice.  The beer is also a little more pricey than other places.  Probably about $1 more than your typical brewery but the alcohol content is higher, so I like to think it evens out.  Now let's talk about the food...  YUM!  there are definitely hits and misses on the menu so just listen and plan accordingly -  Grilled Cheese - if you're a fan, don't think, just get it!!  It's so good and one of the best in the city.  Get it with the bacon jam and you won't be sorry.  A delicious blend of tomato, pesto, cheese and bacon jam on crusty bread.   Flatbread - good choice and good for sharing!  If they have a daily special one, go for that.    Fish Tacos - was a daily special one night and really good!  One of my favorites in town so far  Service is great too!  Everyone is friendly and very helpful with the beer selection!    Tip - visit during Happy Hour time if your life allows it - much better deals on the beer",

The variety of beers is amazing, truly something for every palate. We got two flights and tasted a dozen different fantastic ales, stouts, blondes, IPAs, you name it. This day's red basket special was a brisket chili dog - delicious! Then we found The Mess (poutine) on the menu... *drool* They do it right, with delicious seasoned fries, real cheese curds, and thick turkey gravy. Everything we tried was stupendous, I recommend this spot for all!",

Fine, I'll round up to 4 because that's the rule in maths.",

We had a pitcher of Mother Roads black IPA (best black IPA I've ever had) and a pitcher of 4 Peaks Raj IPA. Can't beat that deal. Each pitcher is about 2 glasses so made it $3 a glass. We will make this place a usual stop after Sunday games.",

Only problem in my case majority of the time is the cider selection is slim.  95% of the times we have been here the females as our waitresses have been awesome with service.  As far as the one male my friend and I had during a Sunday lunch hour was so slow and unhelpful and seemed to not care too much about our table.  The Fries are so good with their buffalo wing sauce.  Their Churchill Grilled cheese is absolutely my new favorite as well. My boyfriend loves the 810 with a fried egg and the chicken legs.  I cant wait to try more on the menu.",

There is great seating outside, but I prefer to sit at the bar so I can fully view the beer offerings as they often change one or two taps during a two hour visit! This is a downtown staple for me.",

Too bad I can't remember their names... Blame the cocktails I had at subsequent bar stops. ;)  I digress.... They write the beer selection on a GIANT chalkboard behind the bar and it is ever-changing as the beers run out and new ones are tapped. Most of our group ordered food and everything looked really tasty.  I tried a friend's sweet potato tacos; sounds unique and they are! Deep fried tacos full of sweet potato and mild spices; tasty!  Bf ordered a meat flatbread... This thing was larger than expected and a great deal for $10. He picked the meat off a piece for me to try and it was quite yummy. The sauce is a roasted tomato and gave the flatbread a great layer of flavor.  They also have a great big back patio... It was a little too warm for our group to sit out there, but over the next month I imagine it will be a really great place to chill with friends and enjoy some brew.  =)  Hope to return soon!",

    "text": "Went on this past Wednesday evening for the first time. They have a small private lot but it was full when I got there at 4pm. There's plenty of street parking around, both paid and free, so you might have to walk a few yards. The beer menu is a giant chalkboard on one wall. They are numbered for easy ordering and seemed a pretty varied selection. I tried the Moa Breakfast from Moa Brewing, New Zealand and a strawberry blonde from The Brewery in Pine, Arizona. Both were good and very fresh tasting. My dad tried three different IPAs and a couple samples of various beers; he liked them all. I'm do not like IPAs at all but they have plenty of hops-free selections. I was a little sad at their lack of ciders - I was hoping for find a place when at least one new cider on tap but they only had one - Woodchuck - which is good but hardly difficult to find (you can buy a 6-pack of their many varieties at most grocery stores).  I also got the Churchill Grilled Cheese and their \"home made\" \"Pop Tarts\". The grilled cheese is mozzarella and fontina cheese, honey, house pesto, and I added bacon for an additional $1. The tarts were more akin to \"toaster strudels\" and were really good - the flavour of the day/week was grape.   The only major problem (which has been mentioned in a few reviews) are the acoustics. When we first arrived, it wasn't bad because it wasn't that busy but by 6pm, it was full and I had to just about yell across our small table to be able to talk to my dad. Not really a place for conversation.   5 beers, 2 meals, and dessert all came to $70 with a nice tip. A little pricier than I like to go for a dinner but alcohol will easily add up. Nevertheless, I would definitely come back for the selection and the food. Definitely a place to try out when looking for a small, local eatery downtown.",

We had a great server who was easily able to recommend one of the 20+ ales on tap.  I had the Nitro Milk Stout and I cannot remember what he had, but it was similar to a Newcastle Ale which is what he wanted.  We both had one of the flatbread pizzas (Garden and Meat) - very good and enough for a second meal.  We also shared the \"pop tart\" dessert - very good and highly recommend.    This place had a lot of locals because of all the bicycles coming in and a very interesting menu - we are definitely planning to return when we go to the symphony.

In addition they allow dogs on their patio which is so nice. The staff is great. They have a very wide selection of beers on tap and you can get a flight of any 6 they have which is also great. The food is super yummy and the desserts are also great the dessert pizza and home made pop tarts are well worth the trip.",

I loved the patio with all the lights strung up in the air; it made for very a nice ambiance. I tried their Tripel and it was excellent. It had a sweet finish and a beautiful gold color. It was served with just the right amount of head and it was less bitter than most Tripels I have tasted. I will definitely be back to try one of the flights I saw everyone ordering.",

I am able to walk!  Food:  This is more than just bar food. I have had some of the salads, the hummus, pretzels, peanut butter sandwich, and the homemade poptart.  Everything has been tasty! The pizzas are excellent!  The pretzels are probably one of my favorites. They come with mustard and cheese.  I have also had the fries with gravy (not a fan).   Drink: Multiple local / regional beers are featured, and the cider on tap changes daily.  I absolutely love the ginger cider and the cherry cider. One can order flights of beers of their choice.   Service: For a busy bar, the service is quite good.  I have been at least seven times in the last year, and every single time, the server is checking up on us numerous times. The servers are friendly and helpful also.   Ambiance: There are TVs near the bar, and there's an outside patio area for when it's nice out. They have some games out there, like corn hole ( I hate that name!)   This place can get packed on Thursday and Friday evenings and weekends too.",

After some research online we found Angels Trumpet and originally went to try their Tuesday special of a TV night dinner.   Sadly, they were out of the TV night dinner as I guess it's a pretty popular thing in Phoenix.   Instead, I went for the grilled cheese & dad went for the special quesadilla of the day. I am a major fan of a grilled cheese, and I definitely wasn't disappointed. I had jalapenos added to mine, which definitely gave it a kick, but I love a bit of spice so it was perfect! Dad's quesadilla was incredible too and we would definitely recommend the food to anyone thinking of going to eat there.   Alongside this, they had a beer flight of 6 tastings for $9 and trust me, their portions are generous. I went for all IPAs, because I'm obsessed and dad went for a different array of drinks.   Anyway, all in all, definitely a must visit if you're ever in Phoenix :)",

It was about a 30 minute wait for a table on a Friday night that we went. I ordered the Spam sliders and some Nitro chocolate beer that they had on tap. The sliders were good but very messy. I didn't like my beer since it was too thick for me and tasted a bit bitter.   I was a bit disappointed in this place. First, it wasn't hard to find, however they have a tiny parking lot so you will most likely have to look for street parking. I think that it's great that they have over 31 beers on tap, however they have this huge chalk board that they just write everything on. There's no menu with their beers on there. I already have bad vision so I would have to get up and go up there every time I wanted to look at their menu.  If you sit in the inside it's extremely loud. I couldn't hear anything my boyfriend was saying. Their website doesn't even have their food menu or anything on there so I can't really even describe my meal or explain to you what my boyfriend ordered.   The service was really good. However, I probably wouldn't come for dinner. I'd probably come for maybe a drink on their patio.",

We chose Tuesday to take advantage of TV Dinner Night and it was uniquely presented and tasty. A great deal for the price. We also would recommend the Fish Tacos.  The inside was loud and vibrant. Everyone appeared to be having fun, but we will sit outside next time if the weather permits.  4 out of 6 glasses of the Beer Flight were really good, but they need to describe their sour beers as sour on their big chalk board. Instead of beers with a hint of fruit, it tasted like a liquid Sour Warhead Candy.   The parking lot is small so bring quarters or plastic for the parking meters on the street.  If you find yourself thereby one afternoon, it is definitely worth the stop.",

They serve the food with their own homemade ketchup which is something I hadn't experienced at a restaurant before.  They offer a beer flight which is always a must if the place offers it. Another plus, their beer selection is constantly rotating. While we were sitting there, they had at least four beers change from their menu.   I'll definitely be back soon!",

Usually, when I visit states and cities, that's the search word I use on Yelp \"gastropub\"  I chanced upon Angels and further review of their patron photos and menu, I realized they had poutine -- and it looked legitimate too! Fries, gravy and most importantly, cheese curds.   We were staying in downtown and had no inkling Angels was for the most part, on campus, a hangout for college students, nearly 2 miles away.  We already felt old-ish complaining about the seemingly endless walk, well, after stepping inside, in the company of all the hipster kids,  we felt even more ancient haha.   The menu was interesting, though wasn't unusual for gastropub fare. We ordered a variety of things: chicken wings, poutine, a burger which had onion strings (forgot the name) and the churchill grilled cheese.  I won't go into detail into each entree because they were all just OK. The item I enjoyed the least, surprisingly, was the churchill.  And of course, as expected for many hipster spots, NO regular ketchup. Well don't worry that didn't affect my review.    I really, I mean really enjoyed the poutine.  It reminded me of my days on Montreal when I ate it literally, thrice a day.   If I ever returned to Arizona, I would come back for the poutine.  Much more accessible than Montreal.",

Our food was fantastic, our server was friendly and efficient and the price was fair.  We will be back...soon.",

    "text": "My family and I bravely ventured out in the heat to First Friday in July so we needed a good spot to eat and a place to take refuge from the blazing sun for a while. I have had Angels Trumpet Ale House bookmarked for a long time now and my yelp app told me the restaurant was within walking distance so we decided to give it a try!   I was pleasantly surprised that they were able to get us a table right away and the service was pretty quick. We were with our 3 year old and I was delighted that they have a kid's menus with several options. My daughter opted for the chicken nuggets and they provided a huge plate filled with fried chicken bits and french fries. She liked the fries more than the chicken.   We decided to split the chicken wings because all of the reviews raved about them. They were giant, crispy, and they came served with several dipping sauces. I didn't love the sauces and to me, the wings could have been a bit more seasoned. We were wavering between the pretzel and riblets but since fried riblets are more unique, we decided to go with them. Again, very generous portion, came with two dipping sauces and fried onions.   On the blackboard I saw they were offering a house made lavender lemon pop tart, so even though we were already pretty full, we had to give it a try. Two warm, giant pop tarts were delivered to our table. The flavor of the lavender and lemon were faint and most of what I tasted was the fried dough from the exterior of the pop tart. I am not sure I would order it again but it was fun to try something with such a unique combination of flavors.  I can definitely see the appeal of this spot. The vibe is definitely chill, hipster, and fits right in with downtown Phoenix's culture. It is geared more towards adults so I really appreciated them being so family-friendly and accommodating.",

We shared the pretzel tower with kicken mustard, angel wings are crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside .. the dipping sauces were good but the dry rub on these is delicious.. chips and salsa were basic they come with salsa & a bean dip   They have an extensive drinks menu on the wall .. including beer, gluten free beer, mead and cider  I had the 810 sandwich .. the artificial smoke made it hard to eat.. it was overwhelming .. The bread was good but it very quickly soaked up the smell of the smoke .. the bf agreed it was bad  He had the brewlee burger with the fried egg, he enjoyed every bite of the burger .. fries on the side were good dipped in that mustard from the pretzels   We shared the homemade strawberry pop tarts, served warm with vanilla ice cream. This is a must .. one serving comes with two pop tarts .. the chunky strawberry filling is delicious and this item the perfect ending a meal  We had great service.. waitress was on top of it .. drinks full, dishes cleared, checked on us often..   We sat inside plenty of seating, there is also a cute patio out back with additional seating",

It seemed to be a mix from AZ, CA, CO and a few others sprinkled in.  There was not a ton of variation in breweries, and there were a lot of beers from \"big beer\" companies.  Not really my style.  We ordered an order of  va-va verde soft tacos and a farm flatbread.   The slaw that came with the tacos was very bland an seemed to be out of a bag.  The beans on the side were cold.  The tacos were bland and left a lot to be desired.  The flatbread had a good amount of toppings and cheese (although I couldn't taste or see goat cheese anywhere on it) and the tomato sauce was very bland.  Overall it was a very underwhelming experience.",

    "text": "I must say I had an EXCELLENT experience here while visiting Phoenix.  I was attending a conference and needed a place with drinks and decent food options to take my team of 20+ people to for a relaxing night out mid-conference.  I checked the website and didn't see a way to make a reservation so I called and was told to send in a email through the contact us on the site and that the managers didn't take reservations normally but often will approve one if you ask.  I got a quick answer and was able to book a table for 15-20 people outside -- which was perfect because the weather was still nice and the reservation was for 6pm.   When we arrived we had a very long table set up for us on the patio under the shade with several strategically placed trays pointing out some suggested appetizers.  We were all able to order $10 flights of 6 beers or our favorite single and I asked for water for the whole table to keep my non-desert dwellers hydrated.  Several servers delivered all our drinks and the water quickly.  For my flight I didn't know what I wanted and asked for heffeweisse, fruity and light and was given a great selection.    For the food, many of us ordered 'the mess' which is poutine as an appetizer and being from \"nearly Canada\", NY we all thought it was very well done, authentic, and tasty.  Some people tried it and then ordered it as their entree in fact.  The sausages plate was amazing as well.  For dinner I ordered one of the amazing fried chicken sandwiches.  I loved that it was an option for various sandwiches to do: fried chicken, grilled chicken, burger, or veggie burger.  What an excellent idea.  My fried chicken sandwich was delicious and this southern girl was pleased.  Everyone enjoyed their food and drinks and the service was A+.  We were treated so well.  For 21 people with drinks, some appetizers, and meals it was only $620 including the 18% gratuity.  Excellent food, drinks, and service for a great price.  I'd definitely return!  I will mention that the bathrooms are non-gendered inside and I think there are 3.  First time I've seen a MAN waiting to use a toilet, made me smile.  Bathrooms were clean and spacious.  Inside of the business was nice as well, full of people enjoying the food and drink.  Lots of patio seating room to be had as well.  And beautiful murals on the building outside.",

I always appreciate Angel's expansive beer options and their creativity when it comes to not just their dishes, but desserts even. This was their Lemon & Lavender Pop Tart which oozed out a delicious, warm creamy yellow filling that lended such a pleasant texture and temperature contrast to the side of ice cream. Definitely a try!",

    "text": "So I want to start with this being my second time at Angels but my first time at this location.  There were several fails of the night that is the cause of this rating.    To make a reservation you can only do so online.  There is no direct link online to reserve.  I had to call and someone told me they had no idea how to reserve but there was a contact email I would send asking for a reservation.  Finally I was able to reserve table for a farewell party for a party of 20-25 people.   Got there early to set up.  Hostess put us in the wrong location (private room).  Then she realized we were not in the right room as there was another party waiting.  Our original reserved tables were given to several other parties.  She had to make the people move so we had tables.  The tables were tall tables with stool, even though they knew I had an 8 month old baby.  Tables were bolted to the floor and seperated... defeated the purpose of a gathering.  They were letting gueat from a birthday party next to us sit at one of reserved tables because that party was in overflow.   Tables were so dirty, covered in filth.  I saw them wipe them down but I dont think there was any soap on the rag.  My baby wipe, without scrubbing, took off quite a bit of dirt.   We had to asked several times for silverware, napkins & plates. They never cleaned off the empty plates and cups so we piled them on the table next to us.  The waitress was slow to bring food, take orders and never cleared the table.  We had to provide direction on where to place the apps.  Come on, they are apps for the table to share, put them anywhere.  Also, the waitress had no idea we had a cake in the fridge.  We had to ask for it and it took her 15min before she came back and asked us what it looked like. 10 min after that, she brought the cake.    Now to the food...fried were really greasy.   Bland sandwiches.  Only thing tasty was the pizza and hummus. My group did give compliments to the drinks.",

We have eaten here previously, but we just had a drink this go around. Both their food and beer are great...can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   I was excited to see there is another location of Angel's Trumpet that opened up near 44th Street and Thomas. We'll be checking out that location as well. I highly recommend heading on over to Angels Trumpet for food and beer, you won't regret it! Cheers!",

    "text": "When I bit into my \"matador\" sandwich I could definitely hear the angels trumpeting so I knew how this place got their name. This was the perfect sandwich as it was roasted top round, peppers, onions, mushrooms and a horseradish Havarti on a pretzel bun. Why are pretzel buns so good?! This was definitely a great alternative to getting a burger. You get a choice of fries, cole slaw or a side salad and I got the side salad. The ranch dressing that it came with the side salad was so good that I ended up dipping my sandwich in the extra dressing, yum! The beer I got was not as memorable but they have a large chalkboard display behind the bar with lots of interesting choices.   They have a \"seat yourself\" philosophy, which was fine but we did wait just a little while for a server to come over and take our drink order. Our server was pretty attentive after that, though.   They have a really nice covered patio area which unfortunately no one took advantage of the day I was here since it happened to overcast and rainy (weird for Phoenix, right?) The interior was nice though, with the wooden tabletops and chairs and the open layout.   Overall, a great spot so I can see why the Yelp reviews reflect this! Definitely one of my favorite meals I ate while visiting Phoenix.",

We returned last night to just have a few drinks and hang out at the bar. The bartender was extremely friendly and attentive. I had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc that they have on tap, and it was delicious! My hubby got a beer and thought it was good as well!

    "text": "Wow what a refreshing establishment in downtown Phoenix. Growing up here I never was very fond of going into urban Phoenix because there was not much going on, especially for quality young people.  Angels Trumpet is the sort of place you wouldn't expect to find in Phoenix, Arizona. It feels more like a chic-contemporary atmosphere of a more progressive city, Austin, San Francisco, Seattle...but in the desert!  I enjoyed the diverse (31) options of beer on tap, including the apricot cider. The menu had its roots in pub food but with a very refreshing and eclectic twist. The kitchen and chef clearly care about providing unique and high quality food. I ordered the 810 \"sammy\" with smoked turkey, bacon, avocado mash, and onions on toasted bread. The taste was phenomenal but there is nothing worse than eating a sandwich with parts without any meat. The corners of my sandwich were unfortunately all bread which was a shame because it had such an amazing smoky smell and taste.  My friend had a gourmet grilled cheese with a unique bacon-jelly, and she loved the taste. Our server Arika was very friendly, professional, and provided a great service  Overall I would like a little more consistency in the quality and presentation of the food, but it is one of the most unique, fun, and quality ale-house/restaurants in all of Phoenix. Definitely worth the visit. I will be going back anytime I am in the neighborhood.",

Recommend reading the menu very well or you could get someone's attempt at a sweet savory burger that is too far in either direction to blend well.   Do try the wings and the hot pretzel. The Matador was pretty good too, reminded me of a Philly steak sandwich but on a pretzel bun.   My husband had the \"Meat Treat\" flat bread pizza. It was good but we had to ask the waitress where it was, she returned to tell us \"they are remaking your order, it will be up in a few (was not a few) minutes.\"   I realize it's Friday night, and they were busy, but after our initial seating we had to flag the waitress down for everything and then she would disappear again. Once I flagged her down, she would immediately dart off, and I'd have to say \"WAIT..\" or she'd take one person's order and leave without asking if anyone else needed anything.  The ketchup that was served with the fries, was pretty awful. That needs to go.   The house pop tart, tastes very much like the Pillsbury dough boy made it. I'd recognize that overly sweet vanilla icing anywhere.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to trying this place after reading a number of the good reviews. I should have read more of the bad ones because unfortunately they better reflect my experience.  The boyfriend and I visited on a Friday night. It was busy so we put our name on the list - no problem. The hostess said it would be about 20 minutes. It was very crowded by the host stand so we went and waited outside, right by the door. 20 minutes came and went and we never saw her come out so we went inside. After a minute or so, the hostess came up to us and said \"oh, I couldn't find you guys. I can seat you now.\" Couldn't find us? We were RIGHT outside the front door. When there are 20 people waiting in the \"lobby\" wouldn't you think to look outside?   So she takes us to our table but did not bring menus so she said she'd be right back. She never came back. The waitress came up to greet us and we had to ask her for menus. She must not have liked that we asked for menus because she was crabby and short with us the rest of the time we were there. (Actually, I assume it's because we didn't order beer. Or she was just a B.)  Boyfriend ordered the burger and I ordered the grilled cheese with spam. We both got fries. The fries were meh, the ketchup was weird - more like pasta sauce and the sandwiches were pretty meh too. They weren't bad but they weren't great. They were forgettable. Writing about my sandwich now I honestly can't really remember it vey well. Not a good thing.  After we finished it took forever to get our bill and they never cleared our plates even though we were clearly done eating. We ended up just shoving them to the side and left with barely a thank you from our waitress.  Needless to say between the crappy service and the sub-par food we won't be back.",

Tons of unique beers on tap, outdoor patio area, sand pit area to play cornhole/bags!! I said to my friend \"great call\"...then the disappointment began.  1st off...no beer list.  Oh wait...there is..it's on a chalkboard back in the main area and a completely obscured moving chalk board across the patio.  Ummmm WTF? I have great eye sight but I can't see around the fatty, heat lamp and dude with his ass crack hanging out.  Ok, so I guess this is a \"get up and look at board\" type of service.  Great.  So that's what I did.  No description of beers other than a #, name, type of beer.  Guess this place is for professional beer brewers only.    2nd...service took forever...and it wasn't even that busy.   3rd...food...also took forever for a simple pizza...ahem..they call \"flatbread\".  I guess i differ on that.    4th...beer...well, I can't complain here...I tried a sampler and they were good. Some real strong ones in their rotation of 27+ beers.  So at least they got that right.    Note to management.  Really that hard every day to sit down and write out what beers are available that day and a little description and then photocopy that 100+ times? Really? Chalkboards? Basically your laziness=causes customers more work...and people don't know really what the hell they are ordering. In other words...not all IPA's are the same. So can ya fill some people in?  If you are a big beer fan and brewer by all means, this is your place.  If not, I'd say seek your libations elsewhere.",

    "text": "Spam!  They have Spam! Yeah that compressed, salty, meat from a can.     Ok, ok...I realized I may be the only one excited about this, ESPECIALLY since they are known for their FABULOUS rotating beer selection, 30+ on tap at any one time.  They also offer some wines on tap as well.  Order up a flight or 2 (6 tasters of  your choosing of any of the listed beers) and expand your beer palate or go for a pint of your favorite. Their menu is quite complementary to their beer offerings.   Ok, now back to the Spam.  Now trust me on this,  when Spam is done right it can be quite tasty.  They do it very well here.  Their Spam Sliders, as a meal if you enjoy Spam as much as I do, or nicely shared.  It is fried to crisp perfection and served on toasted Hawaiian bread  with a Sriracha mayo coleslaw.   My other Spammy favorite is a Sammy, the Churchill Grilled Cheese, you pay a lil extra for the crispy fried Spam goodness (or bacon, you really can't go wrong here) but it goes so well with the melty deliciousness of smoked mozzarella and fontina cheese.    You have to come and check out their Tuesday TV dinner meal.  A TV dinner like compartment tray comes to you filled with yummies that vary every week (Main dish, side or 2, and a dessert). These are not Hungry Man meals  but you won't leave hungry.   Make sure to follow them on Facebook to see what they are serving up that Tuesday and get there early because it has been know to be a sell out option.     I love this place, but, \"Why only 4 stars?\", you ask.  Well, it gets quite loud in the main restaurant area.  Every sound kind of carries and you spend your time speaking loudly to have a conversation.  So when the weather is good I like the patio mostly because the noise issue does not carry-over to the patio.    Always, check their Facebook for fun and educational events and \"classes\".  I recently attended a \"Cider School\" here on a weekend before they opened for business that day.  In attendance were Woodchuck and J.K. Scrumpy brewers/reps.  We tasted 6 types of apples commonly used in cider making. Tasted several ciders, including some that were not even on the market  yet. Oh don't let me forget the food pairing.  The most fun I have had in a long time.  [That event itself was a 10 out of 5 stars, LOVED IT]",

It was over ninety degrees out and the sprinklers were only on every 15 minutes.  When I asked that they adjust it, they never complied.  You can't offer outdoor seating if you're not going to offer some concessions for the heat.  We live in the desert!   As for the food it was ehh.. I ordered the BBQ burger.  Too many onion straws and the BBQ sauce just wasn't good.  It added no flavor value.. The highlights were the bun and the side salad.",

    "text": "This is a long overdue review from several months ago.  I went with a group of friends for brunch and got a dish with a rotating wild game.  I can't remember the name of it any longer.  The game that day was alligator sausage if I remember correctly, and my table ordered four of them.  One of my friends asked for something to be held out of his.  After some good conversation our food started to arrive.  Strangely, everything but the three unaltered dished with the rotating wild game came.  When our server stopped by he was surprised that they were all missing and went to investigate.  He came back and told us that the printed copy that went to the kitchen was difficult to read and looked like there was only the special request my one friend wanted even though all four were on there.  He rushed the remaining three dishes out, and they were excellent.  When It came time to settle up our tab, our server had the manager take the three delayed meals out.  We didn't ask for that and no one in our group had any kind of complaints about the service.  He got a great tip out of it.  We had a great experience and will definitely be making more trips here.",

We've also had the tacos and one of the other burgers.  Old Review (4 stars): This review is coming from people who don't drink beer. But we love the food!

    "text": "Angel's Trumpet Ale House is the perfect addition to the growing Phoenix beer scene. In fact, I've been waiting (with beer-baited breath) for some time now for this place to open, even following the building process on their Facebook page, because it is a great downtown destination for a quality beer after work. With FilmBar right across the street, this block is possibly morphing into one of the coolest parts of town.  Let's talk about the beer. I like the rotating 31 flavors (or is it 32?). Either way, it's more fun than being a kid at Baskin-Robbins, eyeballing the beer selection as one barrel is emptied and another unusual selection takes its place. Sometimes I think it would be better if they had a standard line-up of six beers or so, as it takes some effort to pick a beer that suits your mood. There's a lot of information to absorb from the giant list including brewery, region, beer name, beer style, etc. and many of the beer styles are fairly exotic. However, it is a great beer adventure...  The food at Angel's Trumpet is some good stuff too. I had to try The Nutter after reading a review of this place in a local paper. Get this: peanut butter, bananas, raspberry-chipotle jam PLUS housemade marshmellow fluff and peppered bacon! This was a fabulous grilled sandwich experience you're not likely to encounter elsewhere. The pizzas and Asian-style wings were also pretty damn tasty, so I think they've got all the right elements any respectable alehouse should have.  My only gripe (yet not enough to give them less than five stars) was that it was not made clear that a 20% gratuity would be added to my bill automatically. We started as a group of four that grew to about eight, and the staff was incredibly accommodating. I ended up tipping 20% (on top of the already-included 20%) for my meal, which made things a little pricier than I had anticipated. I want this place to succeed, so I don't feel too bad about over-tipping, I just think they need to mention the automatic gratuity for parties over a certain size.",

There's a huge bar and loads of tables and hightops, but even late afternoon on Saturday this place was packed.  The outdoor area is fun, with Adirondack chairs and Bags, and an awesome view of downtown. And the outdoor patio area is dog-friendly! Next time we'll be bringing the pups!  With 31 beers on tap you're spoiled for choice. And they rotate the beers with some local and national microbrews, so its easy to try something different.   The menu is stocked with, interesting appetizers (spam sliders!), big hearty sandwiches and cheesy flatbread pizzas.   Will definitely be back!",

A warning on the fish tacos, if you don't like cilantro you should avoid them.  I love cilantro so they were great for me, but wife despises cilantro and she couldn't finish them because the cilantro was overwhelming for her.    The only thing that kept it from being 5 stars for me was the noise level.  At times it was hard to hear my wife from across the table.

The beers on tap are diverse for all types of beer drinkers. The place is spacious, the staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and the pricing is very reasonable.    Even though the place isnt very comfy and the decor is cold and uninviting, I can still see myself coming here pretty often. The beer selection, food, vibe, and staff are really good.",

    "text": "The house was packed last night. There was a wait list so I told Mat put me down for two.   I gave him my first name and last initial, because this tells Mat we are yelpers and that is a good thing. We head on over to the bar which was packed and in a moment i was acknowledged and ordered two beers off the black board live alerts. I also asked if there was a cask tonight, \"next week\" the sweet gal replied.  Beer number one: Konig Ludwig Weiss draft poured into a clean shaker glass, this beer is an easy-drinking, satisfying wheat beer with emphasis on predominantly hefeweiss yeast. The flavors are heavy and saturating on the palate, but clean and refreshing. An 84 point beer $6.  Beer number two: Green Flash Trippel poured into a large brandy snifter, hazy orange gold with a tall white head. The beer smells of apples, pears, spices, and malt backbone. The taste is that of a classic trippel. The hops do add some nice balance throughout the beer and the alcohol is well-hidden in the flavor. 83 Points $7.  We walk on to the patio and have a seat while we are waiting for a table to dine. Outside is very comfortable with views the Downtown sky scrapers. There is a quarter moon in conjunction with The Westward Ho tower. It's pretty nice.  Mat comes and finds us happy and chatting away. We walk in and are seated on a two top. I begin asking my neighbors what are you eating. They were super friendly guys and began to show me their food. Drum sticks called Smokin Legs $9 that looked great and a near finished burger$9. Most interesting looking item on the menu was the Bison BLT in a blanket. $8.5. a bison hotdog topped with bacon, seasonal greens, tomato and house made mayo. My gal got herself a Churchhill grilled cheese $8.5 smoked mozzarella and fontina cheese, honey drizzle, seasonal greens and pesto. Side of fries. I ordered more beer.  The house is in need of acoustics. The party was loud but super fun.",

But that's ok I'll just follow him to the bar next time. Rob was pleasent, beer informative & then some. We had the wings which are delightful but if you're not a couple or don't like sharing dipping sauces then ask for extra. The wings were crispy perfection & hot (temp). Just great! We also ordered the warm sausage platter & boy freakin' howdy was it a platter. Definitely either getting one or the other next time but not both. Just a lot of food. We could have easily  shared amoung 4 people. However I'm happy to report 3 beers & an hour later we managed to get all of the meaty goodness down. Thanks Angels Trumpet Ale House for the great service, food & of course BEER! We'll be back.",

    "text": "On a recomendation for a restaurant in a neighborhood I didnt know very well, Angels Trumpet Ale House it was.  Super easy to find and just steps from the nights final destination FILMBAR. Prior to arrival it was Yelped and Googled and this beer centric gastro pub seemed to be the perfect spot to catch up with an old friend prior to a movie.  My beer recomendation was fine as I took my sugestion of the server that offered 3 THREE fruit beers, because I wanted someting lighter. The peach ale was tasty and I cant wait to get back and try some of the other 9000 beer selections, belly up to the bar, and wash those down with the Poutine or as known there as The Mess.  I have heard about this dish that is a late night staple in Canada. heck all  14,000 Canadians cant be wrong. The chefs must hang out in MY kitchen because they used the perfect amount of fragrant black pepper ( my favorite seasoning) near perfect gravy and plenty of deliciouce fried cheese curds on top of expertly cooked fresh skin on fries. This dish was a perfect 9... or 10 or somewere in between that.  I plan to get around that menu but we both ordered the same thing, a turkey sandwich by the numbers. Mine would have been stellar without any chipotle, but the rest of the fine ingredients overshadowed the one overplayed flavor. The turkey was fresh roasted, great avocado and the VERY BEST toasted bread I have had in years. The side of chips were a great option.  The space is really cool, great chairs and heft tables, if not a tad noisy (screeming baby) prices good and this yelper says its a must try when in the Rossevelt Row.",

It just didn't blow me away. I feel like I've had better home made burgers. The fries were over done and I got mostly crumbs.   I'd say the plus side to this place is the beer flights and their beer selection. Can't say I'd be back for the food.",

I've come to avoid Angels Trumpet on the weekends just because I know how unbearably loud it's going to be inside. Thankfully, the patio is enormous, well shaded, and nicely laid out. So if there's availability you can find solace outside.  The beer selection is, of course, unbeatable. There's something new every day, so you better not fall head over heels for a certain brew because it won't be there for long. The service has always been impeccable and I've come to really trust each server's recommendations.",

The spot also serves up lunch and dinner, with a menu full of sammies, pizzas and hamburgers to be enjoyed in the large communal dining room, at the beer bar or out on the patio.  I love that the bar and eatery is right across the street from FilmBar, which makes it an ideal place to grab a bite and drink before a show. When I last went there, I got a Churchill Grilled Cheese Sammy ($8.50), which I got with fries. It wasn't my favorite grilled cheese (I would leave off the pesto next time), but the portion was so huge I could barely finish half my meal. It was a great value.  My companion got the Tractor pizza ($11), which was one of the most unique pizzas I've ever seen -- it came with Brussel sprouts, bacon, caramelized onion, and even an egg on top.  As for beers, there are giant chalkboards describing each one, and the servers are really knowledgeable and can help guide you toward a good choice.",

    "text": "The beer menu at the Angel's Trumpet exerts the sort of fascination over me that the Dairy Queen's 20-30 possible milkshake flavors did when I was a wee urchin and DQ still had goodies like pineapple milkshakes. There are about 30 flavors on the big board at any time, and it includes \"weird\" varieties like chicory stout (which was splendid), along with all sorts of microbrews. I cannot possibly actually drink enough to fully appreciate what this place has to offer.  If you're there for food, the ideal is to hit the happy medium of \"a bit of buzz, a bit of clatter\" but stop short of showing up when it's jammed and the servers are starting to look panicky. My first trip hit that medium perfectly (little did I know!) with the result that my Outlaw Burger was Revelatory!Burger, OMG!Burger, SeraphimSingPraises!Burger. It was every juicy, flavorful thing a medium pub burger should be. And in that context, the space is really cool -- it's like a coffeehouse in that there's a sense of community gathering regardless of which specific party you're with.  My second trip was on a swamped day, and my medium burger was well-done. The kitchen's still working with quality ingredients -- the buns are very fine buns -- so even a meh burger is still a pretty good burger and worth the $9. But flights of angels did not actually sing over this burger.  On the up side, the kitchen positively coated the ribbon chips with red and black pepper, and since I love spicy food, that was so far beyond amazing that I considered asking for more, then decided not to push my luck.  Rumor has it that one can ask for take-out and trot the food across the street to FilmBar.",

Some we liked, others not so much. There is a great selection and I would like to return.  The atmosphere is upbeat and simple. Loved the keg pendant lighting along a row of tables and the patio. The place was busy on a Wednesday night, most patrons in their 20's/30's. The location is ideal. The menu was eclectic. The recommended Mastadon sandwich was boring although the fries a winner. The bison hot dog was delicious although the accompanying coleslaw a miss.  It was pretty on the plate with craisins and feta but dry in the mouth with no dressing or herbs. Next time we will enjoy a few beers and skip the food.",

    "text": "I was here with a group for Smunch on Sunday.  Nice thing about a group is you get to try more than one dish.  All of them were OK.  It seemed liked the biggest hit was a scramble with wild game, that week it was boar.  I had a fish cake Benedict, that week the fish was cod.  It was good. Of interest to note: the fish cake was both the protein and the base.  With a group of 8 you would think the food would come out in a 5-10 minute window.  Actually it was more than a 20 minute window.  The waitress was pretty attentive most of the time but a couple of times we had to flag her down.  Two of us drinking coffee had to ask for a refill.  The beer wall gets it own paragraph.  For good reason.   There are something like 30+ beers on tap plus a few wines on tap.  All of them are listed on the wall with a bit of description and their alcohol content.  Some of them are pretty potent.  You can get a flight of 6 sample glasses for $9, you pick which 6 you want to try by filling out a card, which comes back with the flight so you remember what is in each glass.  I wasn't really impressed with the space.  I liked the look but as many have noted it gets pretty noisy as it fills up.",

The cranberry slaw threw me off a little but it was surprisingly tasty with it. I added sriracha for a little kick. Delicious! I got the avocado salad for lunch. It was  light in flavor but still filling. I love the combination of the yellow beets, mint, avocado, and grapefruit.  My sister got the big guppy. The guac was creamy with a hint a citrus! Her boyfriend for the original salad with brisket. The brisket was smokey. They had a few beers; all of which they liked. I had the abita rootbeer, made with real cane sugar. Very refreshing and strong in flavor. The price was reasonable and food incredible.",

The vibe is cool and I kind of felt that if I were a dude, I would have needed a gnarly beard or fancy mustache.  Tons of beers!!  Huge line of taps with numbers, so you are forced to read the large chalkboard above.  It was a little much for my brain, so I just asked the server to pick a tasty stout or porter for me.    I was pleased to see a decent amount of veg-friendly options (veggie pizza, veggieloaf sandwich, daily special with a veg option, grilled cheese).  I opted for the grilled cheese (I know...I like cheese sometimes, don't hate.) that came with pesto and tomatoes, fries and a side of house-made roasted tomato ketchup.  It was all divine. M'lady had the vegetable pizza, which came topped with lots of seasonal veggies (watermelon radishes, squash, fingerling potatoes, mushrooms, onions, and more).  It was equally as pleasing to the palate.  Our friends ordered the special, fish tacos.  Came with two tacos filled with fish and fried calamari and toppings, rice and beans.  Spicy, but very good and flavorful.  Back to the beers for a moment:  I only ordered the single bevvy, but our friends ordered a flight (any six beers of their choosing) and it came in a cute little muffin pan:)  Kudos all around from the decor to the food!  These folks know what their doing and I like it, I really like it!!",

    "text": "I guess it's about time I got around to writing a review for this place. We eat here almost weekly, and have for the last two-plus years. We have a couple favorite servers but really most of them are good. (There have been some iffy ones in the past, but those seem to be gone.) Because of the service, we walk away almost every week saying how much we love the place.   Beer selection is always interesting. There are usually a couple that appeal to any taste. The flight option is great and you really get a lot of beer for the price. Wednesday's are usually their special event tappings and sometimes you can get a free glass for buying a beer.   We typically go on Tuesdays, which is their TV dinner night. This is the only reason I don't give the place 5 stars. TV dinner has been very hit or miss in the last 6 months or so. We've had some great ones and some terrible ones and some that are just okay. The old chef did a better job at being consistently good. But, if you get a good one, it's a solid amount of food for not much money. I haven't had anything bad off of their regular menu - wings are solid, burgers and sandwiches very good, guppy tacos are fantastic. The desserts are also quite tasty!  Parking can be painful since it's downtown. They have a small lot that is usually full. There are a few un-metered spots but most are metered (most accept cc's now at least).   Oh! Dog friendly patio, and they'll bring water for your pup. Only recommended in nicer weather though as they don't consistently turn the misters on when it's hot.",

Try:  spam sliders, pop tart dessert, sausage appetizer, and good luck deciding between the fries with their awesome ketchup or the cranberry coleslaw  They do a good job keeping interesting beers on tap.  I dislike that the flight price went from $9 to $15 though, that kinda ticked me off.  You could bring a date here and split a flight or two and be able to talk without chewing the whole time.  BTW We are the glass stackers!  And last time, we finally broke some glasses.  Well, I did.  I broke your glasses.  :(",

My lady, kid and I were in town for the Thanksgiving holiday and made plans to meet up with a friend at Angel's Trumpet (his suggestion).  We only had a little bit of time, which sucks, because I feel like we could have spent all night there.  The beer list was impressive, and featured a number of top-notch brewers that we can't get in our current hometown due to distance/distribution limitations.  I was able to select one brew I hadn't had before and one of my favorites that I can rarely get...and it was on nitro.  Good Lord, it was beautiful.  It was like angels singing...or blowing trumpets or saxophones or something.  I was pleased to learn that they rotate selections rapidly, I'm sure that if I lived nearby I would spend plenty of time there finding new beers to love.    The atmosphere was awesome, the patio area was comfortable, and the appetizers we had were quite tasty.  Though our visit was short, our experience was very positive.  I will go back the next time I'm in town.",

I love getting a beer flight because, come on, they have sooooo many great options to choose from!  Every time we go, we start with the spam sliders. Oh my....so yummy! You have to try them!  Every dish we have tried, from the burgers, to the tacos to the hilarious t.v. Dinners are just really, really, really delish!!  This is a great spot for date night or out with friends. Grab a beer flight and enjoy the yummy food!!",

Beer selection is awesome. I ate prior to coming so didn't order any food.  I did my usual which was a flight (6 beers here) and had the waiter select them for me. When I told him I was letting him choose, he told me I made his day.  He chose some really solid beers. And I finished with a 7th beer, a cranberry cider which he claimed was the best cider he's ever had. It was mean good. I think very close to one of the best ciders I've ever had also. Great choice for a great selection of craft beer. Will try some food next time.",

    "text": "I've been coming here pretty frequently for a few years. I used to work down the street which made popping in for a post-work beer very easy.  I've since left that job but moved closer to Angel's, so I'm basically a Sunday evening regular at this point.  32 beers on tap, plus about 5 wine selections on tap as well. I'm more a stouts and porters girl, but you never know what you'll find at Angel's! IPAs aplenty, stouts, porters, gose, sours, fruit beers, ales of all kinds, a cider or two, and seasonal beers are all common finds. There's usually 2 on the nitro tap, and a rotating selection of a few Arizona beers.   I mostly sit at the bar when I stop in, and the bartenders are all quite friendly without being overbearing. Some forget to give you a glass of water unless you ask for one, some give you one automatically.  The place is not a sports bar, they have two TVs playing some manner of sporting events (usually football or baseball) with the sound off and closed-captioning. Music is also usually unobtrusive, thanks to their random Pandora offerings. If you're the type who prefers a rowdy, sports-centric bar, Angel's ain't the place for you. If you want a somewhat lively bar with a nice, large patio, extensive beer selection, and solid food options, this is the place.  Oh, the food. Their menu isn't huge, but it delivers in unique-ness. My favorite thing on the menu is the Central, a fried chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomato, pepperjack cheese, bacon, red onion, jalapeno ranch, and cucumber. The cucumber is what makes it, for me. Their fries are quite tasty, thicker than shoestring fries with a house seasoning that may just be seasoned salt for all I know. Be warned -- their ketchup is made in-house, and it's nowhere near the usual Heinz stuff. In my opinion, it would be more complemented by mozzarella sticks than fries, but if you go in knowing it's not your usual ketchup, you might be pleasantly surprised.  I've also tried their soft pretzels app with beer cheese and beer mustard. Very good, light and fluffy hot pretzels. The Outlaw burger is also a solid selection (pretty standard BBQ sauce/bacon/cheese/onion string burger), as is the Matador sandwich (brisket, cheese, horseradish, peppers and onions, if I recall).  I'll be back. Obviously.",

We actually wanted to try it out because we saw fellow Yelpers mention TV dinners, however when we got there it was only served on Tuesdays.  Bummer.      There was a football game on so many of us were loud and screaming due to the game, but I'm not sure what the atmosphere is like on a regular day.   This place reminds me of a bar you would see in downtown Vegas.  Being a gastropub, they have tons of beers on tap to choose from.  You can also buy beer in a can and take it home in a brown paper bag.  Super classy hahah     Food.  To be honest, the food was just ok, we ordered pizza and burger, but my four stars goes just to the desserts !!! homemade warm poptarts and warm salted caramel chocolate cookies topped with ice cream ...  I guess they change up the flavors of the poptarts so make sure you ask what the filling is.    If you want to try this place out .. I would recommend to skip the meal and go straight for the dessert !",

Their food is fresh, and their beer selection is incredible. The beer flight is a classic, tried and True method for trying new beers without having to chug entire glasses down.  I came here with a friend and discovered some really interesting favorites that I hope will be on the menu. A beer I tried had a very herbal, sage taste to it in its finish and it paired very nicely with the burger and fries that I got.  One thing to note, while I did give this place a full five stars, I personally don't recommend the brulee burger when drinking.   \"But Russell, why did you give this place five stars if the brulee burger isn't five star worthy?\"  ONLY when drinking. See, drinking can cause hypoglycemia. But then you ask, well, eating a brulee burger, which has sugar, seems like a good idea right? Here's the thing, it's straight up sugar. Which, for me personally, makes me feel sick. Eating potatoes or any form of slower intake of carb calories mitigates the stomachache issue. But maybe that's just me.",

    "text": "Beer bar - a lot of places getting titled or tagged as such but few really deserve the moniker.  Angels most certainly does.  If you're looking for high quality beer (and a voracious selection of it), stop here.  The beer selection is exemplary here - around 30-35 taps.  Nice mix of local AZ selections with other world class options.  For examples, there when I was there they options from AleSmith, DogFish, FullSail and other dope breweries.  Ample selection of styles were represented too - not just IPAs - sours, sessions, bourbon-barrel aged stouts - no matter your tastes beer-wise you should be able to find something that suits you here.  They are also on point in terms of glassware for beer - i.e. you aren't going to get served an imperial IPA in a pint glass.   I found the bartenders to be really knowledgable style-wise so definitely ask if you have any questions on style preferences when you are there.  The food menu was also great here - I went here a few times and the option that stood out to me was the big guppy (fish tacos).  You get two tacos with the big guppy but don't let that deceive you - these are BIG tacos.  They come with Angel's \"secret sauce\".  What is - I have no idea - but it is tangy/spicy and fits the dish well. On top of that, the tacos are buried in avocado mash and slaw which adds up to a recipe for success.   Besides the tacos, food options include sandwiches, flatbread pizza and a number of other appetizer-like selections.  As stated before, this is a top notch beer bar and the food delivers too.  Definitely worth a visit if you are in the downtown Phoenix area.",

    "text": "Maybe I shouldn't have had such high expectations. I was so stoked on coming to this Ale House. I have had it on my \"to-do list\" for about a year. When I finally got the opportunity, I was super disappointed. I did really like the building and the bar set-up, the atmosphere was alright, the patio was pretty cute, but nothing special. Just like everything else.   To start, they didn't have the first 2 beer's I asked for. The 2 Sour's that were on their tap that evening were out. The bar tender handed me 2 samples \"Here try these.\" I thought. Ohhh well that was nice of him. Well... lucky for him I am not very picky. The beers he handed me were NOTHING like Sour's. Not even Ciders. I'm pretty sure they were Pale Ales. Ok, whatever. So I picked one of them.   When we were seated it didn't take long for the server to see us and our friends. Pretty friendly guy. But that was the end of that. Our server was hard to track down the rest of the evening. Especially at the end of our meal, when it came time to pay. We sat there for a good 20 Minutes, we waited to catch him and ask for our checks.  The food was probably the most disappointing part for me. The best thing I had was The Mess: house fries, brown gravy & fresh local cheddar cheese curds. But even these were lacking of much needed flavor. The Cheese Curds were the best part. Salty and creamy. For our meals, my husband and I split both the Bbq Brisket Grilled Cheese: root beer braised brisket, pickled onion, tomato, smoked mozzarella, fontina, house bbq sauce  And the Nutter: house ground peanut butter with raspberry chipotle preserves & banana. The Brisket Grilled Cheese, #1 Where's the cheese!? Nowhere to be found. The BBQ sauce was gross. Not tangy or spicy, just bla... The Brisket itself was fine. And then for the Nutter, no flavor. Just nope. I had such high hopes. Dashed...  And here's a pro-tip. NO TALKING, you won't be heard. This place is SO LOUD.   I may have set my bar and expectations too high.  If I do go again, I know what to expect. And that is that.",

We arrived about 9:30pm on a Saturday night, fully expecting a crowd. We were relieved to see there were many open tables and our party of 7 was sat right away. Great! We're off to a good start! After studying the menu and deciding what we wanted (we were starving and thirsty), we patiently waited for a server to come and greet us. 10 minutes went by. No server. 15 minutes. No server. 20 minutes. No server.  While I would usually be understanding if it was busy (I used to be a server myself, so I have a high patience level), MULTIPLE servers were walking past our table looking like they had absolutely nothing to do. One male server was actually strolling around whistling with not a care in the world. We were absolutely in shock at the lack of acknowledgement we received by anyone other than the hostess. After waiting 25 minutes and still not being approached we all got up and left. On the way out, the hostess said cheerfully, \"Thanks for coming in! Have a great night!\". Sure, we probably would have had a great night if we actually would have been served.   It takes a LOT for me to complain about service. As I said before, I have been a server, and I know how stressful it can be...when it is BUSY. This place was NOT busy and had plenty of servers. We ended up leaving frustrated and hungry.   We will not be giving this place a second chance, nor can I recommend it to others after the experience we had.   Horrible service. Absolutely horrible.",

The atmosphere was pretty cool...loved our seats at the bar! The food was Meh (I've experienced better!!). Not what I was expecting when the food came out as everything else at this place rocked!! I got the fries/brown gravy/cheese curds plate. There were like 4 cheese curds on the plate and the fries were soggy and not that good. They did not have an condiment options other than their \"homemade ketchup\" that wasn't even close to ketchup. My husband had an Italian wrap and he didn't care for it either. If we go back...I'll be just drinking...not eating.",

They made us feel totally welcome and we had a great time.   We ordered a flight in addition to a few more beers. Zero complaints. I recommend the saison from Funkwerks Brewery. The Holiday Cider and Decadence Stout were other favorites, but like I said, all of it was excellent. Fantastic beer selection---best in the Valley that I've seen.   The food is also noteworthy: the alligator pear flatbread = out of this world. We also ordered the salad with spinach and grapefruit (can't remember the name) that was equally amazing. What a great experience!! I can't wait for my next visit.",

Loved this place.  not anymore.  not with the plethora of other amazing restaurants downtown.  took another couple with us tonight. had 8 beers, appetizer, and food.  One of the girls ordered a beer that was listed as a peach flavored. she was thinking it would be similar to the 4 peaks peach.  turned out it was an awful tasting sour beer.  we sent it back  and requested another.  When the bill came we were charged for the sour beer.  Asked the waiter to talk to manager saying we didn't think we should pay for a beer we didn't drink.  She came back and said manager said he wouldn't take it off.  nice customer service!  on a beer that probably cost them a buck.   ruined an otherwise nice night.",

My husband and I sat at the bar, and after about a minute my husband had to point out to the bartender that the table needed to be wiped down. Were given menus. We stared at the beer menu on the board, and we probably looked like idiots, but no one ever came over and asked us anything. We finally waved a waiter down. Asked for some suggestions, all i heard was mumbling, didn't want to help, gave us a sheet and told us to put the numbers down of the beers we wanted to try. Gave us our flights, never came over to ask us if we liked anything in particular or if we had any questions... nothing. We also ordered the Porky pizza. The concept is great but there was waaaaaaaayyyyyy to much sage on the pizza, totally overpowering. I had to dig in and take the huge pieces off so I can eat the pizza. We paid, got up, not a thank you for coming, nothing. Don't care.  Thats fine I don't care either and I won't come back.  Go to Four Peaks Brewing in Tempe. Great crowd, great beers, great atmosphere, great bartenders!!!!!!!! Or Brat Haus in Scottsdale!! Great food and servers are very knowledgeable and actually CARE if you like the beer or not!!",

Tons of beers (and some wines) on tap and the choices always rotate.  This time around I got a Hefe from a brewer in the Czech Republic.  For lunch I got what was essentially a BLT on steroids with super thick bacon, lettuce, tomato, as well as pesto.  Really nice compliment to the beer.  The place wasn't too busy since its a Saturday afternoon, but I'm told this place is packed with downtown workers during weekday happy hours.  They have a nice outdoor patio that is ideal when the weather permits, though I kind of wish they'd put something else out there like cornhole toss, a live music stage, or something along those lines.  Overall, the food is pretty good and the service I've gotten here is pretty friendly.  The food and ambiance won't knock your socks off, but the beer selection is really hard to beat.  Nice to have a decent brewpub downtown.",

The selection here is one of the best I have found so far in the Valley and includes 20+ taps of a multitude of beer styles.  The offerings range from common year round beers and seasonals, to imports and some of the slightly harder to procure stuff (If only I had actually enjoyed that Bourbon County Brand Stout - woops).  Service is usually pretty quick even when crowded (as it can be on the weekends) and the food menu is delicious, sober or otherwise.  Definitely a fan of the wings, and spam sliders.  Need to try the tv dinners in the future.   They have a nice outdoor patio and seating area as well where you can enjoy a game of bags/cornhole.  Who doesn't like cornhole?  Honestly, if you are into craft beer or just beer-curious you need to try this place out asap.",

Inside I always sit at the high tables.   Their pork burger is to die for. We love their PB&J and their pizza is to die for. The only thing I hate is their ketchup, which is like homemade crushed tomatoes. Yuck.  I'd go more if their WIFI was stronger. I have to sit near the bathrooms to get a good connection. The staff promises they're trying to fix this. Also, please please make a huge north facing sign so more people know you're there.  If you are lost, find Film Bar. They're across the street.",

OMG the beer! and great beer.....a wall of taps of the nectar of the gods. the pints are reasonably priced and you can do a flight of 6 of any of their beers, even the expensive ones! from 9% to 3% alcohol content, heavy stouts to light lagers and everything in between, you are bound to find an option of beer that suits you here...only problem is, you may get wasted in your efforts to find your favorite!  the food was pretty good...a small selection since the focus is beer but my fish tacos were excellent and my wife raved about her arugula salad.   what a great find!",

(yes)  IPA (yes) Amber (yes)  Stout (yes).  With thirty some craft beers and wines on tap, beer drinkers are frozen with indecision which probably is annoying for the bartender.   You just can't go wrong here --  you just can't.  The problem is both good and bad: the kegs are constantly rotated so you can never develop an affinity for a favorite beer (bad) but you're always discovering new beers (the good).  I never met a beer I didn't like.  Any rate, I stopped in for lunch and a beer.   Today, I ordered the Big Guppy tacos and wow!  4 good size strips of beer battered cod in two tacos with slaw, guac, salsa and some killer beans!  With food though, you can establish a favorite and the BIG GUPPY is now my favorite and comes highly recommended!  Then again, the Wild BLT wrap is  a hard one to kick to the curb.     Oh yea, that one beer become 4 or 5 as conversations at the bar are easy to start and difficult to end -- especially with all that good beer flowing!  Kind of reminds me of the public houses back in the midwest -- (those with fish fry fridays!)",

Hardly any parking and the area behind the ale house is someone else's private lot however many people were parking there and then asked to move it.   The waitress was nice but usually invisible when we needed her. So service wasn't the greatest that night and it was hard to tell who was the staff versus guests.    The food was really good.  We had the flatbread with leeks, bacon and egg, really really good.  Plus fries with gravy and cheese curds, this was a huge serving and will feed a table of four!  Only thing, it took forever to get the food, bur we waited patiently however could not hear each other since it was so loud.  If you go , try to get a table outside. Inside, you will have a conversation with yourself since no one else will be able to hear you.  The beer choices were good and as big as some other places. The glasses weren't that cold either and by the time the food came the beer was warm.I will go back just not on a busy night and will ask to sit outside!.Cheers!",

If you have 2 hours for lunch on a Friday, and you want some good beer and good food, you really can't go wrong.   Parking can be somewhat of a hassle, but look at the meters on McKinley if there is nothing available in their parking lot or out front.   Hot tip: if you like variety, their 6-beer sampler is not a terrible deal at $9 because their pours are always more than the advertised 3 oz each. Also, they have a phenomenal selection of stouts right now, if that's your thing.",

On their menu they've got items like spam sliders, home made pop tarts, flatbread pizza. Their beer menu is lovingly written on chalkboards around the bar and there's a huge ton amount of them; a real measurement BTW, look it up in any engineering book, if you can't find it right away, just keep looking.  Again, while we've already established I don't really love beer, I have partook from time to time, it's unavoidable when all your friends are doin it ;-)  I do enjoy their tasty salads, have sampled a number of other items from the menu and have never experienced anything I wouldn't order again; except for maybe that weird dessert pizza thing. It's like a big mixture of things from around your kitchen that you would make and scarf down when you've had one or two-welve to many. I love the hip downtown atmosphere and it's a great spot to gather with friends or randomly run into them, cause everyone is usually already there.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!",

    "text": "Every time people from outside of Phoenix see pictures I post of Angels' TV dinners (only served Tuesday nights), they are astounded that that much food only costs $7. As my visiting NYC friend said, it's practically free _ or at least a killer bargain. It is a little bit like Christmas morning when you look and see on Facebook what Chef Brian will be serving for TV dinner. Past entrees have included fried chicken, meatloaf sandwich, pulled pork sandwich and chicken skewers. They always come with sides (thank god there's only enough to fill those little TV tray compartments) and a dessert.   I would already be a fan of Angels without the creative TV dinner nights. Even though I don't drink, the atmosphere here is fun, lively and so not pretentious. And it's always fun to people-watch. I used to think it was dominated by hipsters but I see white-collar office workers, men showing up in a bowtie and jacket look like possibly an ASU professor. It's very rare that you encounter someone crazy boozy. Also, the patio is a treat. They turn on the misters in the summer and they have a board out there as well with what's on tap.   The comfort food on the regular menu is amazing as well, the pizza and the sandwiches (you have to have at least once the nutter--peanut butter on sourdough with raspberry chipotle jam and marshmallow fluff and for an extra $1, peppered bacon). They also have big, fried spud tacos with sweet potatoes. A little too spicy for me but otherwise delicious. My only beef (or should I say pork?) is why on Earth would you serve spam sliders? I tried one on opening night and I could barely make it through half. Not worth the skyrocketing sodium levels. For the desserts, the \"pizza\" with marshmallow, pretzels and chocolate is so-so. But the housemade poptarts, I could inhale. A definite treat worth getting!  This has become one of my go-to spots for visitors or if I feel like I deserve a treat for the week. It's one of the best gastropub-restaurants to happen to Phoenix.",

Part of the fun of drinking and dining here is anxiously watching as one of the staff removes one beer from the list and replaces it with a new one.    And the food -- so good.  I had the wings and pretzels (just appetizers for me this time) but the burgers, sandwiches and pizza my coworkers had looked good too.  The wings were seasoned and flavorful, cooked perfectly and served with a unique chunky buffalo sauce, an awesome chutney and perhaps a ranch or tzatziki sauce (I wasn't a huge fan of this last one except for dipping the accompanying carrots and celery). The pretzels, though awesome, served mainly as a delivery device for the savory and delicious beer cheese sauce.   Lastly, don't pass up on the homemade pop tart!  Our table split one order and it took a lot of willpower for us all to avoid buying individual ones for ourselves.  That night they served apple cinnamon ones.  They were more like toaster strudels, but that's a good thing!",

You can't miss it from the street: with the brightly painted angel mural taking up the full length of the building.  Inside, they have a huge selection of beer, with plenty of seasonal selections. On the most recent outing, I tried a gingerbread lager which hit the seasonal spot.  I haven't met an item on the menu that I don't like. I could go on about the pretzels- amazing! I order them every time I'm there. But I can't overlook the flatbreads or the hamburgers. All are delicious.   During the summer, it is nice to grab a cool brew on the patio (which is also dog friendly).  If you are looking for a great spot downtown- add this to your list!",

    "text": "Oh. My Word. HOW have I never yet reviewed you, Angels Trumpet!? Of all the many places I've come to adore in the Valley, Angels Trumpet Ale House remains King of the Hill. I can still remember my first time there - the way my eyes crossed when I saw that massive chalkboard loaded full of delicious craft beer options!  Angels Trumpet Ale House officially offers THE BEST selection of quality craft beer in the Valley. It offers THE BEST grilled cheese sandwich, THE BEST burgers, THE BEST fries, and THE BEST ketchup. Did I just say THE BEST ketchup? I did. Angels Trumpet makes their own ketchup and it's good enough to drink on its own! (Seriously.)  Angels Trumpet Ale House is THE FIRST downtown eatery I introduce my friends (and any newcomers) to when given the opportunity. It is THE FIRST restaurant on my mind when I get hungry. I now live all the way up in North Scottsdale and still make a point of traveling the 45+ minutes south and west just to eat here.  The beer list of 30+ craft beers rotates constantly, so you've always got fresh new options to choose from. The beer flights are VERY reasonably priced and serving sizes are always more than adequate (for both food and drink). The homemade pop tarts are freaking delicious, too, and I don't even like sweets or dessert foods.  If you have yet to experience the Angels Trumpet difference, you need to. And don't just go once: visit a few times - get to know the menu. I've never ordered anything here and been dissatisfied. The ambiance is wonderful, the service is outstanding, and the food/drinks are out-of-this-world delicious. Give it a try!! I'm confident you'll love it!",

    "text": "First visit was a great one.  Had a blast with good people and tried probably too many beers.  Thankfully I wasn't driving :)  The place was slammed SLAMMED, but some friends had already been there for awhile and had been able to get a table before I showed up so there was no waiting for me.  Straight to the beer!    That said, there's a lot of craft beers that you may never have heard of.  Do the sampler, try as much as possible, that's my philosophy.  Some of this stuff will catch up with you.  The Beast was 19% ABV!   Wut?  :)   Glass wall at the end of the huge cooler gives me something to stare at and drool over.   Love the huge outdoor patio.    Lots of patio heaters out there.     Parking can be a challenge.    The only thing I can think of that might be undesirable is that there are homeless people hanging out just on the other side of the back wall to the patio.  They even have mattresses and junk out there, so it appears as if some of them sleep out there.  I'm not so worried about them, other than that they lend trashiness to the area.  My girlfriend, on the other hand, was a bit uncomfortable with going by herself out to her car to get something she forgot, and I can't blame her, so I went instead.    Great spot, except for the very limited parking, which might force you to have to interact with the homeless people.",

    "text": "First of all, what's up with the downtown area? I've been living in the suburbs of Phoenix for 20 years and I never thought of the downtown area as being a \"happening\" place. When we got off I-10 and proceeded south, there was traffic and people every where. We were really surprised.  We went to Angel's Trumpet on a Friday night and arrived around 7 p.m. The wait time was about 15 minutes and we were able to pass the time in comfortable chairs on the back patio. A waitress came by and offered us water or drinks while we were waiting. Even though it was about 110 degrees that day, the misters kept the outside area cool so it was comfortable when the first available table was outside.   Beer: The beer selection was great and they seemed to have various styles for everyone. I love amber beers, and although they only had one selection (Sunset Amber), it was a tasty beer. As is typical of most bar establishments, the beer selection was heavier on the IPA, porter, and wheat style beers. My boyfriend and friends tried several kinds (unfortunately I was the DD so I couldn't try as many) and they enjoyed each one. A particular favorite was Sculplin IPA. If it wasn't so hot outside I may have tried one of their wines \"on draft.\"  Food: Amazing flavor combinations! It took us a long time to decide what we wanted to eat and none of us were disappointed with our food choices. I had a sandwich (\"Bingo\")  from the daily special menu with french fries which were served with marinara sauce instead of ketchup (delicious). We had the poptarts which is why we tried Angel's Trumpet in the first place. The seasonal poptart was bourbon peach which had a type of oatmeal crumble on the top (no frosting). It was delicious - flaky dough with fantastic flavor.   Service: Not great for us, but tables around us had much better service. Angel's Trumpet was busy, but our waiter was either not very organized or just slow compared to the waitress buzzing around to the other tables around us. I wish we would have had her instead. For instance, a table behind us on the patio was sat at least five minutes after us and we hadn't even been greeted yet. Then the people who were seated behind us had drinks and food (appetizer) before our beers even arrived. Our slow waiter was very irritating.  Overall: It's a long drive downtown just for food, but we will definitely be back (hopefully with the stellar waitress and not the slow waiter). We all enjoyed our time at Angel's Trumpet and liked the energy of that area in general. It was also fun to see so many different ages congregating in one place.",

    "text": "Nice location, would really like to see more places like this downtown.  We liked this place overall. We went on a Saturday night, and it was busy but we didn't have to wait for a patio table. Service was good, always nearby when we needed something. Had the wings to start, but were a bit dry and over cooked. Comes with 3 different sauces, but small bowls and can't dip.  I'd skip them... Had the Chet for dinner, lots of ingredients, focused on beans and chorizo.  Wasn't a huge fan, it was spicy and no contrast, beans and French fries.   The beer is where its at though. They have about 30 taps, all craft brew many of which rare to see. They had \"Enjoy By\" - Stone Brewery, handful of Dogfish, Firestone etc...  Easy to pick your flight, just write the numbers on the sheet.  Overall enjoyed this new place, just going to try some different food options.",

It took nearly an hour to get our food and when we did 2 of the 3 plates we ordered were cold and one of them \"the nutter\" didn't have the extras that we ordered on it.   The lamb sandwich had a good taste but again was cold and the bread took some sawing to get a bite sized piece.  A bit overpriced for what you get.  4 beers an appetizer and 2 sandwiches set us back $63 not including tip.  Service was friendly but very slow.   I really want to like this place, especially since it's in the hood  but as of now I have mixed feelings.   I will probably give it another shot in a month or two.",

    "text": "First time here. Service was awful and slow af, on a Thursday night at around 9 pm. There was hardly anyone there so it's not like they were busy. The bartender was a stuck up, rude, hipster, bitch. Like come on, smile, fake it, and work for your damn tips. I wondered how the hell she even got hired. It was my friend's and I's first time and we met a group of 4 people there who had already racked up a bill of at least $75. They also said she had been rude all night to them as well, ignoring them and rolling her eyes at every little thing. I wanted to slap the attitude right off her face. We were so nice, polite and patient with her, for her to be treating us like shit. After ordering our drinks, which took 10-15 minutes with a bar that only had 5 people at, we closed our tabs immediately and moved to a big table hoping to be served by waitress instead. But there was no waitress to be seen, my friend went up to the hostess after about 20 minutes of sitting there, then she sent someone over to us. She was nice but kind of an airhead. She brought the food to us and there was a long black hair on the pizza. Sent it back and got another one, it was delicious. Also the beer I was drinking was wonderful, my friends enjoyed their beers as well. Yet it was $9.65 for the smallest glass of beer I've ever seen.. I want to come back here for the beer and food but that horrible service is really stopping me, I don't think I'll ever be coming back. Unless you want terrible, slow, rude employees to wait on you, hair in your food, and over priced delicious food and beer come here.",

This is my fifth visit to Angels Trumpet House for the fantastic beer selection. I usually don't review on first visit because my opinion might change and I believe a review should be on average. Every establishment has their on nights and off nights. The 31 tab beer selection is outstanding if you are a beer drinker and not looking for the run of the mill domestic beer. The food is interesting I had the chorizo and polish sausage appetizer. Not great but not horrible either. The acoustics of the place are kind of a nightmare, it is truly deafening and very difficult to carry on a conversation with someone right next to you. If they are across the table-game over! It's definitely more of a Phoenix winter place so you can sit out on the patio and not suffer from tinnitus by the end of the night. So if you and your buddy love a great beer selection and don't have much to talk about this place is for you!",

The only down side is trying to figure out which ones to try and the at least my server wasn't too eager to help me choose. So so I randomly picked the 6 I thought sounded good, I wasn't disappointed but I don't know a whole lot about beer so it should have been nice to get some suggestions. So the service wasn't too spectacular but the beer was fabulous and the food was pleasant as well. I had the pretzels and wings. Personally I like that the wings come with the sauce on the side because I enjoy crispy wings and it's way cleaner. Oh one more thing since this place is located downtown there are very few parking spaces so be prepared to park a a meter.",

The other night, I had three beer snobs out for drinks and dinner.  As always, the beer was fantastic, and the quality of the food has become consistently excellent.  The real star was our server, Chelsea.  Pretty, funny, and prompt without being obtrusive.

We grabbed a few pitchers of beer here; one pitcher equals 2 glasses and at 6 bucks a pitcher it was a good deal.  I saw that they had SPAM sliders, and I do love spam, so I badgered my other half into ordering them.  I really enjoyed my Spam sliders, they were cooked crispy and came to the table nice and warm.  They went perfectly with my pitcher of Mother Roads black IPA.  Our service was a little on the slow side, unless you are sitting at the bar.  It has always been moderately busy when we were here, but not too busy that it is too loud (I hear that is a major complaint).  Since I don't like overly loud places where conversing is a problem, I think I will continue to come here during off peak times.",

Their beer list changes literally daily [they changed 3 different ones while we were there] so you gotta check the menu when you're there.   However, I'm not a huge beer drinker, but I do enjoy some cider and a glass of white wine on occasion. My only wish for this place was they had a few more ciders. Guess I'll have to go back to their revolving beer list to try again!  Also, I thought this place was super hipster urban and fun. They have a great patio as well.

The ambiance is...brightly lit, industrial warehouse look, definitely not romantic but I would say fun for a first date. Not too loud so it's easy to carry on a conversation which would make it a good place for a business meeting or lunch (note to self!)  I ordered the chicken, pesto & spinach pizza which was yummy. We also splurged on the homemade \"pop tart\" which was really more like a puff pastry turnover but was good. On Tuesdays they also do a \"TV Dinner\"  which a few people got and enjoyed. Someone else mentioned that there aren't many gluten free choices and my GF friend and I shared my pizza - she scraped off the toppings!  They have a decent beer (around 30) selection, which they write on a chalkboard because the beers rotate in and out. A bunch of people tried the beer flights and I sponged off my friends flights lol. I ordered a full pint of what I know I like (raspberry framboise & guiness). I'm not an adventurous beer drinker.  The service was excellent and our waitress was super friendly.  I'm only giving it 3 stars because somehow this place lacks the appeal of wanting to go back and make it an official watering hole. It's OK.

    "text": "FOOD People are griping about the creative license the owners took with the names of their food, but my issue is over the fact that it is almost always tepid. I don't know if it's the server's fault or the cook(s) not timing things correctly but I don't think I've ever had a sandwich/burger that seemed freshly cooked.  Two or three weeks back, I dined with a friend and he ordered one of the \"specials\"- some sort of veggie sandwich that had decent ingredients but the different flavors just didn't go well together. I don't think he even ate half of it.  As a heads up, they make their own 'house' ketchup and if you don't like the taste, you are SOL since they don't have store-bought ketchup.  BEER Maybe people love how often they rotate their beers but I'm not made of money and can't hit up their place every 2-3 nights for their $6+ beer. I'm also not really a fan of how their beer menu is presented- the bar area doesn't need to be that crowded. If they had a weekly rotation, they could print out weekly beer menus. My favorite bar in IL did this and it worked out just fine. Maybe learn how much beer to order or be okay with not having 31 'flavors' at all times?  Also, people rave about how amazing having flights are (really?), but I don't think it's a really good deal. The pours for the flights are about as much as the pours for a sample- if you're with at least one other person and you both get 3 samples, BAM! a free 'flight.' Increase the pours on your flights, or decrease the pours on your samples, otherwise it is infinitely cheaper to keep saying \"Can I have a sample of X, please?\"  SERVICE Not consistent.  I'm not sure how many have actual beer knowledge but I'm betting they use the 'beer list' as a crutch. I get why they have the beer list as I'm sure they don't want to answer annoying questions over and over but this is the ONLY place I've been to that does this and I would honestly prefer a beer menu and use google if the server can't answer my beer question.  OTHER I've been here a handful of times; twice when it was really busy (2nd night they opened and the grand opening). What you'll take-away from your experience is how incredibly LOUD it is inside, whether they're crowded or not. They need to invest in some dampeners or something, and considering how much they charge for their beers ($6 is the average, a few $5, rounded out with $7 and up), I'm sure they can afford it.  While I like the idea of their TV dinner night, I went once and the experience was lackluster. It's on the patio and the screen is TINY. Unless you're in the first 'row' or two of tables, you won't get a good viewing experience. In addition, you can't hear anything. I thought they'd have it streaming on speakers or something, but no. So if you're expecting to watch a movie, expect to be ignoring it instead.  I love their mural. It's maybe my 2nd favorite in PHX (after the 'illegal alien' sombrero one on Calle 16, also by Lalo Cota).  They don't currently have a happy hour but they do have a 'Ladies Night' on Wednesday. $1 off drafts.  They don't allow smoking on the patio. However, their patio is dog-friendly although I've yet to bring my dog since I live walking distance to the Main Ingredient (they have all day happy hour on Sundays and Mondays! $2.50 drafts, folks)  I expect I'll bump my review up to **** stars eventually since I really like the appearance of the place and the beers they bring in. Maybe after I get a hot sandwich?",

    "text": "My husband and I had a dinner at Angel's Trumpet for ~15 friends to celebrate our elopement. We came in at 2pm on a Sunday. It is an awesome space. Perfect open-air seating and spacious layout. As soon as we got there, the manager immediately started putting a row of tables together for us on their patio. Our server, Brendan, was clearly knowledgeable about the beers (noting their alcohol contents, nuanced flavors/characteristics, pairings) and provided polite and timely service. Our food was delicious! Brendan also gave my husband and I a FREE and absolutely scrumptious homemade pop-tart: chocolate cherry, so GOOD. I will let my photos speak for themselves. My *ONLY* complaint is that it was really tough to find an updated menu online. Their business website needs work. Other than that, I had a wonderful experience. Keep up the good work, Angel's Trumpet!",

Walking in you are greeted by an enormous chalkboard with the current 31 beers on tap as well as the cask fresh wine. An amazing selection of Arizona and other beers. The red ipa was particularly good. Foods is excellent also, I had the avocado salad and fish tacos which were awesome. Nice people and understated service was good, I could see why people may think service a little rude but the are guys that know their beer and are not in your face over friendly which I kind of like. Go check it out.",

I stared at the chalk board menu completely dumbfounded and paralyzed by indecision and it took me a few minutes to settle on the Full Sail Amber which was delicious (though you can'r really go wrong with Full Sail, can you?)  The minimal-artsy decor makes it right at home in the downtown arts district and the bar and layout make for a loud, lively atmosphere. I don't think I'll be coming here for meetings because the place is very loud and the beer is just too damned distracting.  It reminds me of the lovechild of Postino and Lux, with Bliss and Lost Leaf as the step-parents. The crowd seems to be a mix of the downtown artsy folks, some of the ASU crowd and the post-work working crowd such as yours truly.  They have a LOVELY patio with beautiful grass and meticulously groomed plants that I would have LOVED to trample on and destroy when I was a kid. This is PERFECT now that the weather is hopefully cooling down....at least at night.  It is a shame that smoking is not allowed on the patio, it is sizeable enough and it makes me sad that I cannot enjoy my beer while indulging my filthy habit. Other than that, the staff are friendly and enthusiastic and the wings look amazing so I think this is going to be a great addition to downtown.",

Angel's Trumpet has tons of those, and one would be wise to follow their Facebook and keep watch for elusive elixirs like Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA.   Initially, I wasn't impressed with seeing Crispin, Rogue, and Deschutes, but my bartender was able to find the right pint for me. It was categorized as a \"Sahti\", and it is was freaking delicious.   The food here looks like common grub anyone can enjoy (pizza, burgers, etc.) but with an emphasis on finer ingredients. My friend ordered the pop tart, and it looked tons more fancy than your average breakfast snack!  The atmosphere is calm, everything is super clean, and there's a great patio. This is a place to have a nice sit-down dinner, or socialize in a quiet, almost classy environment. I'll be back to try some dinner, and I'll keep my eyes out on the taps!",

We loved their beer selection and the bartenders were all on top of everything, helpful and efficient.  We had a great time and all the food coming out of the kitchen looked awesome.  We only tried their 'pretzels' which are actually just a few little loaves of pretzel bread, not the same but not terrible.  The stools are not the best and not very comfortable but in the end we enjoyed ourselves and were glad we got the chance to visit.",

Parking: Only bad part, small lot and metered parking on the street  Decor: Awesome modern decor with a full indoor outdoor area. The whole place opens up and mesh's awesomely. At least in the spring/fall/winter. Might be crazy hot in the summer  Service: They have a lot of people working there who are all very knowledgeable of their crafts beer and in love with their food  FOOD: I don't want to sound like a white girl but OMG. Everything was just stupid stupid good.             Fish Tacos: They are just dummy good. The amount of fish you get in these things are just stupid good. Every bite was a little bit of heaven. By far the best battered fish tacos I've every had. Cabbage mix, beans, crumbled cheese, uhhhh falling in love again just thinking about it             Burgers: All the patties are delicious. The buns work perfectly with all the additions they put on them. If you love egg on everything like I do, just get any burger and add an egg. It's so good!!!            POP TART: This made me reevaluate my life of desserts. Seriously the flakyness, barryness, sugarness. Just every part of what they got in that thing is crazy good.     Just go, don't think about it!!!!",

The beer selection will have something for everyone, and the food is pretty darn good. You can drop in for a beer as part of a stroll in the neighborhood, or you can snag a table and post up for several hours. The place can get crowded, but it's not they're fault they're doing the things right.   The staff are great with recommending beers on the 31-draft rotating menu based on what you like, and the prices and ABV are right on the menu as well, so it's hard to be unpleasantly surprised, even if you're not the adventuresome type.  My only critique of this place is that if you prefer spirits or an alcohol-free evening, Angel's has very little to offer. Without the fun of exploring the beer selection, the food goes from \"pretty darn tasty\" to \"I'd rather have gone somewhere else.\"",

I wanted to try a bunch so I decided on the beer flight, our server was very helpful and informative in the decision process. I told him what kind of beers I liked and didn't like and he wrote down his suggestions for my flight. All of the beers were very tasty and I decided on a few faves. For our meal, I chose the casper pizza and my friend got the fluffernutter, both were very good and the portion size was large.

    "text": "My wife and I first visited Angels Trumpet in September 2015 after being told we needed to check it out by some friends from the burbs (apparently this is better than Applebee's). It was kind of \"good enough\" but had some decent beers to give it a notch above mediocre at first take. That said, the server couldn't tell us much about the beers..... I'm pretty sure we got the \"light beer\" vs \"dark beer\" comment, or something of the sort - very disappointing for a server at an ale house (she later admitted, \"I'm not really a beer drinker\"). Overall a kind of \"meh\" experience.  About a month later, a client recommended meeting here and I thought it was worth giving it a second try. This was a better experience than the previous one, but still just not hitting it on the head for me. This place is seriously missing something in the way of ambiance or otherwise. It feels so bland and mediocre, and yet I feel it has so much potential.   I've been back a few times since last fall, reluctantly - to meet up with friends/colleagues - each time getting yet another \"Well, it's not Applebee's, I guess\" kind of experience. As of March, I've decided to put an end to the repeated disappointment. I made my last visit there just before learning that the owner sabotaged an effort to build up the area's appeal to residents like me, which was supported by an awesome group of nearby bars/restaurants and others. Wow, seriously?! Way to ensure that your ambiance never improves! Angel's Trumpet: not Applebee's and not feeling good in the neighborhood. Go somewhere else if you want quality, service, and genuineness from a pub.",

I've probably been into Angel's about 20 times over the past few years, attending their Anniversary parties, Beer Week Events, Tuesday TV dinner nights and, most importantly, as a pre-and post-game ritual before Dbacks games. This year I got myself a mini-season ticket package so have been in about 5 times in the past couple months.   This is THE beer bar in downtown. The selection is awesome, I always go for a flight because the pints can be a bit pricey but the flights are always $9 unless they have a rare beer on that's not flight-eligible. The food is incredible here, from the pizzas to the burgers to the salads and of course the homemade pop tarts. The staff can be hit and miss, but, if you sit at the bar you're pretty much guaranteed an awesome conversation with a top-notch bartender. Sam has been working the last few times I was in and is a great beer-fan to talk to get recommendations from, but every bartender has always been really good there.   Downsides, hmmm...well its very loud in there at times, super noisy building. Oh, and they close at 12, which is a bummer if your game went extra innings and you were ready to drink up a few rounds of awesome beer afterwards. But, they don't serve liquor, so I get it -can always head across the street. Really though, this place rocks. Come in, sit at the bar, get a flight and enjoy the awesomeness yourself.

    "text": "Since moving to Phoenix a bit over a year ago, Angel's Trumpet has become my favorite place to grab a craft beer and a bite to eat.   It's a great spot to meet with a group of friends or to just belly up to the bar and try a new beer. Be prepared for a possible wait if you want a spot at the bar though. I've rarely come here when it's not hoppin' (no beer pun intended... actually that's a great beer pun).  Since they regularly change taps, you'll never get bored of the beer selection. That's truly what keeps me coming back again and again. The atmosphere is laid back and the service has always been friendly as well, so that doesn't hurt the return factor either.   Aaaaaand that's my no non-sense review update, Cheers!",

My frozen fish stick tacos were twelve dollars for two of the and a small ketchup holder of beans. They use pizza pans to serve their food and all other dishes (aside from beer glasses) are plastic or styrofoam (water cups).  Basically you pay 65$ for four beers and two meals with chips and salsa.  What you should pay is about 45-50 for the same thing.  Oh and you can expect poor service to include missing ingredients for you meals and a lack of concern from your servers.  If you choose to eat here good luck.    They get two stars for the great selection of beer.  Otherwise it would be one star.",

    "text": "It's taken me a while to write this review because I didn't want to write it seething mad.   However, its been three months and the experience is still on my mind so I have to get it off my chest.    I was so excited to take our close friends and family to Angels Trumpet to celebrate my husband's graduation.  Angels is a local spot, and since we were downtown residents I wanted to make sure we took them to a special place.  Some of our guests had never eat there and it had been on their \"must visit\" list for a while.  After my husband's graduation ceremony we made our way to Angels.  We were taking a group of 9 people to celebrate his day.    We ordered our food and everything was fine until my dad tried his food.  He took a few bites out of one of the chicken legs and was turned off.  He asked my father in law next sitting to him to take a bite out of another leg and my father in law was turned off as well.  I didn't try it, but if it was enough for both these men to not want to take another bite, I decided to notify our waiter and hopefully exchange it for something else or maybe just take it back to the kitchen in case it wasn't cooked correctly.    The waiter seemed fine at first, but then when he went to consult management he came back with a much different attitude.  He came back very snarky and patronizing because two of the legs were bitten into.  He said that since they had eaten \"half\" of the order that they couldn't do anything about it.  Okay, back up for a moment.  My dad took a bite and then my father in law took a bite of another leg to see if the taste was just my dad's dislike or if the chicken was really bad.  It's NOT like my dad ate half his plate and decided he was full and wanted to get a free out of it.    My dad is a little more passive than I.  He didn't want to make it a big deal so he placed another order for a different dish.  I was seething!!!!!!  My dad basically gave his place double his business because his first dish was awful.  This waiter was going to make us pay for the awful chicken, and had the nerve to get offended that my dad didn't like the chicken.  It was as if this waiter was the one who cooked the chicken.  Really guy???!!  We were a large group and, no doubt, we were going to be faced with a hefty bill.  The least they could have done was not give us a flipping attitude.  I decided to look for the manager.  Turns out it was the bartender.  He told me the same thing the waiter told me.  So at this point, it makes sense.  The waiter is just relaying same awful attitude and terrible customer service as his boss.  In the end, they offered to just let us pay half of the cost of the chicken plate.  What a headache and we still paid for half the chicken even though we didn't eat half!!  Look, I don't want to split hairs on what they should have done or what is considered good customer service.  But the attitudes of the manager and the waiter were absolutely unacceptable.  Thats what made it such a bad experience.  Sure one of the dishes was bad, but if they just apologized or did something nice everything would have been fine.  I felt bad for our party because we were there to have a great time and Angels' staff was less than accommodating.  This restaurant is STINGY, rude, and I don't recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "Here are my 2 biggest gripes about this place. It is loud. Like really loud, so loud you have to really come close to yelling to be heard.  Also the service is mediocre at best. I really don't think this is anyone elses fault but managements for running the place, what seems to be, threadbare  at best. The staff were hustling on a Friday night and even so they were clearly overwhelmed. Maybe on weeknights, this can be a quiet little place to go to but don't bother on the weekend. Every single time I have been here, it has been packed.   The beer selection is excellent, they do offer samples if you cannot decided what to get before you get a full pour. I wish they had more Belgian beers on tap but there's so much variety to pick and choose from that it is impossible to get everything up there anyway.   The food selection is good and I mostly stick to the appetizers or snacks when I'm here, I mean lets be honest I'm here for the beer and so far it has not disappointed. The waits were not too long for the food regardless of how busy they were , so kudos to the kitchen staff for hustling like no tomorrow.   Great place for large groups, the outdoor seating area has some games and is nice when the weather outside isn't oppressive. The patio is dog friendly so bring your puppers cuz they need some love too :)   Fun fact: Enjoy the mural outside by the empty plot of land before someone throws up apartments all over it. Angle's Trumpet Ale House and the Goldwater institute sued the city to prevent a taxbreak to Amstar/McKinley LLC over a proposed 6 million taxbreak to build micro apartments on that empty plot of land. Not sure how I feel politically about this, but hey, beer.. amirite ?",

    "text": "If I can sum up Angels Trumpet in two words: hipster beer.   It's located in the RoRow district [location along makes anything hipster-ish], and they have a crazy selection of rotating local, seasonal, and craft beers. Both times I've been, the chalkboard has been updated a few times. It's a positive and a negative if you find a really good beer to drink and they run out. Happened to me recently when I came to hang out with friends, and to my surprise the beer I ordered was not the one I drank.   If you have to wait for a table and want to get a [cute cupcake tin] flight, definitely write down beers from the big board while you wait. Don't write down the names, just the #'s as that's how they fill the sample cups. And keep an eye on the board if something changes! They also have a complimentary matching mini board outside if you decide to sit in the patio area.   My first visit was with a fairly large group on a fun light-rail beer crawl we planned. Angels Trumpet was on the plan because of its proximity to the Metro and Yelp told me they have a lot of beer [both True]. One of the girls arrived ahead of most of us so she was able to secure a few high tops next to another - wasn't a problem for the spot. I can't remember our servers name, but he was pretty good for having to deal with ~15 drunk-ish people and all of the beers and food we needed and getting our checks not mixed up. Make sure to order wings mixed in the sauce! They are so bomb dot com.   The most recent time I came my friends and I sat outside as one of the guys brought his puppy! While the beer, wings, and company were fabulous, the service then was just bad. We had a hard time keeping up with our waitress's location when we needed her to order anything, get water refills, and get our checks. I noticed she would disappear for 15min at a time or so. Luckily though another waiter tried to care of us in her absence.  I hope by my next visit that the service improves. Definitely want to check out their cheeky tv dinner and trivia night!",

Fortunately someone was leaving so I took their space. The beer selection is large with more than 25 taps, and all a good variety of styles. They also have wine available if beer isn't your thing. I ordered a stout that I have had before and enjoy. My friend had a cider. This time I also ordered food. Looking over the menu they have a lot of variety, but I happened to see an odd tray someone left on our table. It was a cardboard compartmentalized tray with words written in each box. What the heck? Then I noticed on board by the wall there was a listing of specials. One said TV dinner, and that is what this tray was advertising. The special tonight was a Hawaiian pulled pork sandwich with a grilled pineapple & island sauce, Hawaiian macaroni salad, citrus vinaigrette salad, coconut rice, and banana cake w/ cream cheese frosting. I asked how much and it was $10 and change - cheaper than a burger. I was also intrigued by the special \"Homemade pop tart\", but I didn't order that. I went with the TV dinner and it was a lot of food. The pulled pork was excellent, but the cake stole the show. Man, what I nice meal that was - like no other TV dinner I have had, that's for certain. The decor and ambiance of the bar is relaxing - very open, nice subway tiles, and an excellent staff. I highlight recommend this place.",

The habanero slaw was ok - hard to keep this dish fresh unless you cook/prepare with each order. Ambiance/patio is great when the weather is nice.  They advertised a tv-dinner menu worth checking out for a future Tuesday evening.  Gave three stars because they did not have all the beers available on the chalkboard menu nor do they serve any domestic beers, which can and would be an option when the selection is sparse (and IMHO it was slim pickings for our palette)!",

The menu is simple, with a few sandwiches, some tacos, and usually two salads and varies from day to day.  My experience with the food has always been positive. It's not gonna knock your socks off, but it's better than most casual beer pub food.  The service has always been very good to outstanding. Although the crowd is mostly on the  younger side, I've seen plenty of older folks and a few families.",

Even though I love wine and I think it's cool they have it on tap, I always go for their beers. They have a huge selection. I went there on a Friday night once and even though they were slammed, the bartender made sure to attend to us promptly and even made a suggestion based on my preferences. He let me sample a beer first before I committed. That's always nice. Their wings and pizza were okay. Wings weren't that crispy and the pizza wasn't the freshest, but it did the job of filling us up. I'd come here to drink again. Maybe next time I'll skip the food.",

Everyone was pleased with their food.  Angels get s busy on the weekends, so be prepared to wait. We went across the street to the Cobra Arcade Bar to have a beer and play a few games while we waited to be seated.  Cheers!",

Spam Sliders: all my friends are super hype about spam and I've only ever had it in masubis so these were yummy! very flavorful and the buns were perfect.  Flatbread Pizzas: I love that you have an option to add fried eggs on top. Eggs make everything better. The fun-guy was one of the best pizzas I've had in a while.   Great service and atmosphere too!

The only reason I couldn't give a 5 Star is because no official kids menu which I knew before we came so I just packed my picky toddlers pb&j's. If they would have or will eat some chicken tenders and fries it would have been perfect. We live in scottsdale and where on our way to the circus and so happy we found this place we will make the trip down here again it was so good!!!! I highly recommend the Outlaw burger they where kind and where very accommodating for my request of no bun and places it on some lettuce it was cooked perfect and the flavors where amazing , my husband ordered the fried chicken sandwich which he said was very good. He's a bit of a beer snob and was very happy to see the great beer selection. Hope they open one closer they would do amazing in N. Scottsdale / N.Phx area .fingers crossed",

Their wings with their house made hot sauce (make sure to say tossed wings) is good. The sauce had the most unique taste I've had had on my tastebuds. Spivey, tangy, sour and sweet all at once that just works so well.  My girlfriend ordered the sweet chili chicken flatbread and I got myself the burger. I have to say from the start, this is probably the fattest burger I've ever gotten. Every component in the burger was perfect. The burgee was cooked perfectly medium rare. The fries were delicious. They even come with house made ketchup that was honestly probably the best thing on my plate.  My girlfriends flatbread was equally amazing. The chicken was flavorful and not dry. The bread was soft with a nice crunchy bottom.  Absolutely coming back for the wings and that flatbread. Be warned guys, come with a big appetite.",

I thoroughly enjoyed the fish tacos for dinner and friends all had burgers. Very delicious! Favorite thing was the pretzel appetizers that we had to get because we were so hungry. Friendly service and decent prices for the quality of food we got. Only downside was the wait. It was 9pm on a Friday and when we walked in, we were told 15 minutes. However it was almost an hour. We stood there the entire time (a group of 3) near the hostesses and they never once reassured us that it would be soon. A friend went up to them to ask if it would be soon and they couldn't give us an answer. We were pretty hangry by the time we got our food. That's the only downside, though.",

Last week I had meatballs, pesto pasta, mushroom salad, garlic bread, with a cannoli cheesecake. Even if I'm not in town, I check the Facebook page each Tuesday to see the TV dinner meal.  On days other than Tuesday, I enjoy the pizzas. My favorite is the Tractor with 2 eggs, bacon and a variety of cheeses.   The continually rotating beer list is always top notch. Great variety and selection from breweries around the country. If there are a couple I have my eye on, the beer flight is a good option.  Always a great meal and drinks at Angels Trumpet!",

This is one of the newer business on Roosevelt Row so it is a typical trendy place in downtown Phoenix. Overall, not a bad place to grab a beer downtown.

I did have their grilled cheese and it was good but not great. The cheese was like it had been melted but then sat out for a bit so by the time I got it it somewhat rehardened. My friend was extremely impressed by the wings, so maybe I just didn't get the right thing. I will definitely give this place another try to experience their beers and try something else off the menu. Dog friendly patio is a huge plus too.

Music seemed too long for dates, but you can get away from that on the patio if you want. The honeycomb/chicken wire plays well to the classy-hipster theme.  Well staffed. Our server was attentive when he needed to be, and not overly but didn't miss filling waters, beer, food, either. Nice work on that hire!  Beer: Beer selection is great, and staff knows what to recommend based on what you're in the mood to drink. Or, get a flight, and you'll get a range. The flights are served in a muffin tin so you can easily carry and go play bags in the patio, or sit until your table is ready. I saw wine, but my group stuck with beer.   Good ole fashioned:  great, medium cook for me and was cooked correctly. Fries come with natural tomato ketchup sauce (awesome!!). The Cole slaw is a healthy portion as well.  Farm flat bread:  recommended by the server and he was right, it was delicious and a more veggie friendly option.  Riblets: Healthy serving, great bbq sauce. (Bones included in the but size pieces.) I couldn't find on the menu so not sure the menu name of what my friend ordered.  Chipotle hummus:  healthy serving, big pieces and easy to share. Quantity and quality trumps the presentation.  Hot pretzel: Cooked perfectly, soft middle with crispy outside. Cheese sauce is delicious. Literally everyone orders these so look around if you're hesitant. I think 4 on a platter. We are them too fast before I could take a photo.  Pop tart: I heard and read about this, but we were to full and I'll have to come back to try.",

The place is interesting with a long bar, high top table seating as well as regular sized table seating, a mid-century modern corner seating area and a large outdoor patio with plenty of additional seating.  The beer menu is on a chalkboard above the bar. I had two dark beers while I was here which were good but I was eally craving a sour which they did not have any on tap. Oh well.  For lunch, my coworker and I both ordered the Matador sandwich which was beef covered in havarti horseradish cheese, peppers, onion and mushrooms on a pretzel bun with a side order of fries. The sandwich was great and beautifully presented. The one criticism is the pretzel roll was a bit dry. The fries were good also and the ketchup was amazing.   Really enjoyed the place and talking to our server. But still would have liked to see a sour on the beer menu. Apparently sours aren't as popular yet in Phoenix as the rest of the country.",

    "text": "(Lyrics - Robbie Williams - Angel)  I sit and wait At Angel Trumpet Ale House And do they know The places where we go When we want a drink...... 'Cause I have been told That their craft beer sets the bars up high So when I'm thirsty for a drink Thoughts running through my head And I feel the love is dead I'm loving Angels Trumpet Ale House instead  And through it all Angel's offers me 31 taps of selection A lot of food and confection Whether I'm right or wrong And down the waterfall  Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me When I come to call, Angel's won't forsake me I'm loving angels Angels Trumpet Ale House instead.  Angel Trumpet Ale House is located in the heart of the cool and hip part of Phoenix.  What I mean is its where all the hipsters hangout.  It's all good!  I actually enjoy the atmosphere here.  It's not over the top nor do I have to dress my ass off - though I do anyways!  Like most hipster bars, I feel like I should ride my bike with a banana seat except I don't have bike nor would I get one with a banana seat.    Anyways, I ordered a special tonight, which was called the Garfield.  Not sure why really I guess the Chef's name was Mr. Garfield maybe.  It was pretty much a low carb tortilla wrapped with turkey and the fixins' along with some fries.  I didn't think much of it.  My friend ordered the Smokin Legs, which was roasted chicken legs, but she got 3.  It was obviously a lot for her since I think she only ate one and nibbled on her sides.  Needless to say, I'm not a fan of their food!  Then again this is an Ale house!  I really do like this place because their selection of crafted beers.  Daily changes one what is brewing so that's awesome.  Instead of your usual Stella, Bud, or Peroni, Ale house offers some funky ass names and taste I can't describe.  Over 31 selections so it can be overwhelming, but take your time Angel Trumpet isn't going away anytime soon.  I say start with what you usually drink flavor wise and then work your way into the adventure side! - Enjoy!",

I had a beer flight, $10 for 6- 3oz. pours, a great price as they don't have restrictions or upcharges for pricier beers.  Location-close to downtown.  Parking- metered only, $1.50/hr. Inside- nice size bar, open main area inside with large patio.  Ambience- decent/chill, not loud or rowdy A big Con was the limited and pricey food menu. We really wanted to snack on something but nothing looked appetizing or worth the price. Overall, still would definately return for the great beer selection.",

I was told on one of those calls \"we don't save tables\".  I explained it was a party of 25 on a Thursday night and felt the cost would go to at least $800 to $1000 all cash!

I came with my wife and a few friends and decided to try the beer flight.  Unfortunately most of my beer choices were unavailable.  How annoying.    On top of that the service was sporadic.  Ordering took a really long time because the cranky server was always buzzing by our table, but never stopping by.  The beers I ended up trying were just so so.  Another problem with Angels is that I actually enjoy talking to people, which at the decibel level maintained in the ale house is pretty much impossible.  Due to the awful service I chose to decrease the tip for the server.  Probably to about 10 percent, which considering the service was generous.  The server then had the hutzpah to follow me out and ask me if I had a problem with the service and ask for more money.  I complained to management about this, but they did nothing. Suffice to say, I will not be back.",

But I work downtown and have been wanting to go here for since they opened. They close at 11 everyday other than Friday and Saturday when they close at 12. They've been closed every night that I've tried to go. This past Friday I walked by just past 12 and they said they were closed. Even with a lot of people still inside. A lot of people heading to the Turf.   I finally had a chance to stop in when they were open. As I said the beer selection was amazing. I had no intentions on eating there since the menu seemed a little too far out there. We ate anyways. I had the nutter sandwich. Sounded interesting. Pb&j with raspberry-chipotle jam, banana, bacon and marshmallow cream. It was ok, but tasted like candle wax. I'm not sure why. My wife had the stroganoff burger. Not bad, the bun was burnt and cheese not melted. None of the food was hot. Fries were really good though even at room temp.  Their homemade ketchup tastes like sweetened marinara.   I would still recommend trying Angels Trumpet, but only for beers or even their wines on tap. Dine somewhere else.   We sat at a table inside and didn't have any issues with their service and didn't mind the noise. We could still talk to each other without yelling. The music playing in the background was good but could barely hear it.",

They do have a very large selections of beer but the process is very confusing. All of the beers on tap are written on a very large chalkboard above the bar. They use several different colors of chalk for each selection making it very hard to read. It may be easier if they pick one color of chalk for each type of beer, that way it is easy to find what you want. Or have #1-5 be one type of beer, #6-10 another and so on. My boyfriend spent so long trying to find a beer on the board because of this. Two of our friends were so overwhelmed with the way the selections were presented they just asked the server to surprise them with a choice.   The acoustics in the place are terrible. It was so loud inside that it was hard to carry on a conversation at the table.   Also, no happy hour. This would be a great way to draw in an after work crowd.",

    "text": "Mat and Sharry Engelhorn have a big hit on their hands. Angel's Trumpet Ale House, so named because of the meaning of their last name and their passion for all things craft beer, is my new favorite place.  Service: Generally speaking, opening nights are fraught with disaster, poor service, and mediocre food. Not so with AT, everything was as amazing as I would expect it to be when the place wasn't jam packed with people. Our server was pleasant, pretty speedy, and explained a few details to us. She was in a hurry, but she didn't hurry us, and that's a really good thing.  5 stars for service.  Food: The FOOD! Oh yes the food was incredible.   I can think of no greater sin than soggy wings, but these wings were crispy and tender, with an incredible spicy buffalo sauce, and a delicious bleu cheese dressing. Instead of throwing a few carrot and celery stalks on the plate, they were made into a salad with a few radishes for spice and color. Let me say again, the wings are AMAZING.    My honey ordered the pizza with peppered bacon, sausage, pepperoni, and leeks - it was crispy, just enough cheese and sauce without being overwhelming, and the ingredients were amazingly high quality. I ordered the Southwest burger, and it was incredible. I love that you get to choose your protein - I chose beef, and the beef patty was moist and perfectly cooked/seasoned. My only \"complaint\" is that I wanted MORE Adobo sauce for a bigger kick, and maybe a bit more cheese, but those are easy modifications to make next time around. The burger bun was light and delicious, with perfect flavor to compliment the patty and toppings.   They also have featured seasonal dishes on the chalk wall as you walk in, and they sound absolutely incredible.  Dessert was fantastic and a fun play on childhood treats. We ordered the seasonal pop tart which was strawberry rhubarb, and it was delicious. The filling wasn't sickening sweet like a normal pop tart, and it was spread between layers of what looked to be a modified puff pastry or phyllo dough. The top was drizzled with a fantastic thin frosting, and finished with sprinkles of pink sugar for a playful and crunchy touch.  5 stars for food!  Beer: Their beer selection on tap is magnificent. So many beers I know and love, and many that I had never tried/heard of before. I tried two new IPA's and they were both splendid. The pour was great both times - one in a pint and one in a tulip, the head was perfectly poured with just the right amount and appropriately sized bubbles. Their beer folks know their stuff. 5 stars for beer!  Atmosphere: I loved walking up and into ATAH. The slump block building reminds me of my childhood home, and their metal grate dividers outside are genius and rustic. The inside perfectly blends the beauty of the wood rafters and block walls with bright colors, natural wood chairs and tables, concrete bar top, and tile backsplash. And you can't miss the massive amount of windows to let in the sun and the gorgeous sunset views. It was a True pleasure to take part in the best time of Arizona summers at this amazing pub. Oh, and I love that they have three unisex bathrooms, it is a nice relief from the standard multiple stall setup that precludes you from privacy in your most private moments.  5 stars for atmosphere  So that's 5 stars all around, and I only expect it to get better with age. I'm going back tonight, and maybe tomorrow, and definitely Sunday. I'll be here a lot., you should definitely try it.",

I only liked 2 of the six he selected.  I am not a beer drinker, I like them light and not too hoppy or lemony.  After about 20 minutes we saw another server and asked her to inquire how long before the Spud Tacos were available again.  She came back and said 45 minutes, wow.  How long does it take to cook sweet potatoes in their kitchen?  We were not going to wait for them and we were glad because I read the review on the New Times about an hour later and it was not glowing.  I think this place has potential.  It is a little bit too noisy, I think they should consider putting some noise absorbing tiles.",

    "text": "I went back - this place consistently under scores.  No knowledge of beer from the waitstaff.  Takes 15 minutes to realize the beer you ordered is tapped out.  Busch League.  Patio still lacks lighting.  I won't be back sober.  Look:  Place is well done and I liked the clean look to the taps and backsplash.  Very loud, to the point where you're shouting to the person across the table.  Once the weather improves, opening the doors to the patio will help the noise.  Does this place have lights out on the patio or was it closed?  People want to sit outside at night if the weather is reasonable.  Beer:  Overpriced.  Local brews (4 Peaks and Lumberyard) were $6/pint while everything else was ~$7-9.  Yes, craft beer is more expensive but not everyone is willing to pay that much for a few beers.   Food:  Very tasty, diverse and I thought they could even increase prices.  The 810 was great.  Overall:  I've been looking forward to this place opening for a year now and was let down.  I'll go back in a few weeks, hopefully the bugs are worked out.  If they don't improve, I'll just buy a 6 pack of good beer for $10 and sit on my patio, which has lights.   Also, not sure if they have a happy hour but they need one.",

The waitstaff has been very helpful and friendly, and although they (understandly) can't speak with authority about all of their beers, they were always willing to get me one of the owners - who are beer gurus - to answer my questions.  I finally got to try a sour/wild beer on tap!!   The weather is so nice this time of year, and I love it when they have their big garage door open - which also helps the sound level quite a bit.   The homemade poptart is a fantastic, fluffly, baked puffed pastry with delicious filling and cream cheese frosting - think a gormet toaster strudle.  The ketchup is very interesting since it is made in-house and its nice to actually taste that tomato flavor.  I NEED to try their fluffernutter (peanut butter + marshmall fluff) next.",

    "text": "I've been there on off nights and now on a Friday night.  I was optimistic about liking this place, but now I just don't want to go there.  It fails in every important regard except pretense. It tries to be semi-fancy with a Bauhaus style minimalist interior decor, carefully plated dainty portions, but the service is abysmal.  Tables are packed in as tight as they can be fit and it's very difficult to move between them. Friday, friends mostly got drinks from the bar and the whole evening, no one came by our table -- not even once.  Yet going to the bar is battle.  It's more like a college bar on game night.  I watched for 20 minutes as the bartenders huddled around the two restaurant computer terminals, waiting their turn and talking, running in and out, avoiding making eye contact with anyone, and occasionally turning around and randomly serving who happened to be right there.  By bad luck, I watched two sets of people surrounding the whole bar get served and didn't get served myself.  You could tell me to suck it up, but I know that in bars on corners, in sketchy music halls, dives, and nicer places, all over Phoenix, there are bartenders who know how to manage crowds with grace.  Good servers are hard to find, especially when you're apparently hiring based on looks.  They have a bunch of inexperienced kids.  While waiting at the bar for 20 minutes, I was asked approximately six times to move so that dirty dishes could be unloaded in front of me, or a server could squeeze by behind or in front of me, but at no point, despite me gesticulating and trying to make eye contact, was I offered a beer.  At no visit on any night has the wait staff been professional or competent.  I imagine ever trying to ask questions about what's on tap or what's coming in would be met with awkward confusion.  This is what I expect of  Mill Avenue on a Friday night. I love beer and I especially love good beer, and this establishment is on in a long string of places opening up across the valley that pretends to deal in that.  Another reviewer complained that they were confused by the beers and their hard to pronounce names, which is funny, because they've taken the step of numbering all of the taps and having people order by number.  The wait staff doesn't know the names of the beers or anything about them either.  And the beers are almost entirely non-extraordinary.  It's mostly stuff that you can get at Safeway in a bottle, year round, which admitted is better than some places with lots of taps where most of the taps are Coors, Bud, etc (that's the only star this place gets from me).  It's not that the beers are bad per se, but things like Oak Creek Brewing Company's Nutbrown and Four Peaks Brewing's Kiltlifter are $5 beers.  Those are also the sort of beer that's often on happy hour.  They're fine drinkin' beers, but charging $7 for them and being uppity about it only makes them seem better to people who have no idea what's going on.  This makes the facade of snottiness but actual ignorance, and the other reviewer's consternation, even more amusing.  A bar behind a Walmart attached to an ice hockey den in my neighborhood, the Icehouse Tavern, has better beers and a better selection, though in bottles.  The Icehouse Tavern also has chill, friendly service that's expertly executed.  Wound-be hipsters looking to enjoy a good beer and praise an interesting venue would do well to go there instead.  Boulders on Broadway in Tempe has better beers on tap and friendly, sane service, even when it's crazy.  Popago Brewing in Scottsdale has better beers on tap and knows theirs beers and though the service isn't fantastic, it's genuine and they know their stuff.  Taste of Tops in Tempe is five stars across the board -- beer, service, ambiance (okay, maybe only four on ambiance -- but still vastly better).  The Filmbar across the street from Angel's Trumpet has some good beers and ambiance and feels a lot less like a college bar where the inexperienced serve the inexperienced in droves.  The Roosevelt, not far away, though often packed, has great ambiance (it's an old brick house in a historic neighborhood), some good beers, though fewer taps, and significantly more accomplished servers. Places like Angels Trump House are able to pack a crowd, but that's it.  They do a disservice to good beer by pretentiously, rudely, and amateurishly serving mostly mediocre brews.  As an apparently independent outfit, I would expect better, not worse, than miserable, cynical attempts at beer snobbery for the sake of it, such as Yard House.  I fear that places like this will just keep awesome establishments that deal in craft beer from setting up in Phoenix.",

    "text": "OMG - I hate writing this review for I've heard so much about this place!  We've been meaning to check out this place since it opened especially since the Roosevelt had closed.  We had family visiting over the long Columbus Day holiday and needed a night out with just the two of us especially since it was my birthday!  We even left Grandpa at home to try this place by ourselves!  When we arrived we walked into a \"please seat yourself sign.\"  Hard to \"seat yourself\" when the place is packed.  We finally was offered a table at the back per a group who graciously gave up their table for friends who were a no show.  This was a table with a perfect window view of behind the scenes of the keg taps.  We waited about 12 minutes or so before a \"waiter\" felt bad for us to ask if we had ordered yet.  We asked for a drink menu only to be told we should have either looked at it on the way in or take a step outside to see it!  We told him what we wanted to drink and he said he would do the best to match our needs.  We get our drinks and the menu looked good and we figured out what we wanted to order but then another 15 minutes went by without any waiter attention and we decided to head off to another local place that we knew we would get better service.  We were forced to simply leave a $10 bill on the table for no one every came back to check on us and we promptly made our way to the door!!!!  I don't think we will be making our way back here anytime soon, we really should give this place a 1/2 star but we liked what they did with the place ;o).",

    "text": "stopped in for dinner last night. It was our 2nd time there since they opened. We previously just had some pints on our first visit but was looking forward to checking out some food. We ordered some flatbread and a burger. The flatbread came to our table 30 minutes later and it was cold. Our server was busy with other tables around us and did not even ask us how the flatbread tasted. We waited another 15-20 minutes and the burger never arrived. The server never did come back to our table to check on us which was pretty weak.  The co-owner noticed our frustration and approached our table. I explained the situation and she was very cool and apologetic although was making excuses about the horrible service.  The server finally came back to our table after seeing the owner talking to us (weak)....anyway, I asked the owner to comp the flatbread and bring the check for the brews we ordered.  I understand they are trying to work out the kinks with the kitchen problems but the server really dropped the ball and did not apologize. I was quite surprised when the bill came back to the table and saw the beer was not comped by the owner (we had 2 pints and a sample tray)... Before the bill arrived I had specifically stated to the owner it was our 2nd visit and how we wanted to come back again. I told her I was impressed with the beer menu and thrilled they had Saison Dupont on tap that evening. Anyway, I paid the bill with a $0.00 tip and we left...worst dining experience I have ever encountered in my life. I am hopeful with time they will be running an efficient kitchen but our server was piss-poor and the fact we had to pay for the beer after the fiasco with the food was unacceptable.",

    "text": "Where to begin....we finally made it to this joint on an event night for beer week. It was nice to see the place packed on a Thursday. The service was prompt and our waiter checked on us a lot even for as busy as it was. The food....wow! Talk about taking some run of the mill items and reinventing them in such a great way! We got a variety of items to try/share. Word to the wise:the portions are quite big. Not some tiny hipster plates that barely touch your appetite. The warm meat platter was amazing. A variety of sausages and sauces that were all spot on. A great way to start off with the amazing selection of pints. Our platter didn't come out right away as it got lost in the shuffle, but our waiter was more than apologetic so I can't really fault them on such a busy night. We also tried the Churchill grilled cheese with spam as an add-on. I can't wait to have this again! We used to have this in Minnesota a lot, but the high quality cheeses they use and bread really make this an amazing dish. My friend had the Nutter Fluffer with bacon add-on. Nutella, bananas, bacon, peanut butter, marshmallow cream. I'm probably missing a couple of items but man was this done right. Every bite was an adventure as each flavor came out. My wife got the mash tacos (I forget the exact name) mashed sweet potatoes, cheese, pesto in a fried shell. More of a quesadilla than taco but again....simply amazing. It's one of those menus you look at and think, \"how would that go together?\" Well it does. Can't wait to get back and try so e more items and beers.",

No one greeted us while we wondered around trying to figure the place out, as several employees walked past us some even making eye contact. After figuring out it was seat yourself, again first time in, we waited for a very long time for service. Contemplated going elsewhere, decided to stay and then figured out what we were going to order for both appetizer and lunch and read most of the beers on the board...still no server! Decided to go to Pita Jungle for lunch where we had a great time, great food and above all great service!!",

The music is deafening and the acoustics and patrons talking make it a difficult place to relax.  They give you a piece of paper and a golf pencil and make you go stand in front of a board and choose your beer, many with which I was not familiar.  There were so many people jostling for position in front of this board and the one over the bar, that it was very off putting to me. There was no clipboard to place the piece of paper on so the golf pencil poked right through immediately.  I asked the waitress why they couldn't print up a menu of beers everyday so people don't have to stand around crowding some board.  She told me because they run out of some beers nightly.  I said back, then the waiters could just tell you what is 86'd as they run out..  They could kinda do like at sushi restaurants, where you check the item you want at your table.  Wanted to love this place, it was utter chaos in there and I couldn't have a conversation with anyone.  I don't think I'll be back.",

When entering we waited for the hostess to seat us I asked what's the deal with having to wait to be seated at an Ale House? We were told it was a restaurant but we could have a seat at the bar without waiting if we saw available seating. We were cool with that. We chose to sit at the small lounge area. It was cozy. There is an outside patio area. Love the 31 flavors of beer concept. We were told all the beers were micro brewed beers. Sweet! We were informed we could have a six beer sampler tray for $9.00 plus tax. I passed on that. Our server Brandi was very nice and informative. She recommended a Pale ale beer for me and a pumpkin cider beer for my sweets. I had a couple of beers, when I received the second beer I was informed the keg had ran out of beer leaving my glass three quarters of the way full. I was discounted two dollars for that beer because of this, that was nice. I thought the beers were a little warm. I like cold beer. I really liked this place and plan on returning soon.",

The ambience is cool and very new American (high tables, wood tones, creative understated lighting, music is groovy and a little louder, very casual, a lot of beards eating here).  Tried two server recommendations: the pretzel and the fish tacos.  Pretzels (4.5 stars):  These were very good, among the best pretzels I've had.  The plating was done artistically, the pretzels were soft and spongy, and the dipping cheese and mustard were flavorful.    Guppy Fish Tacos: (5 stars) Outstanding!  Huge fish portions that were fresh and delicious, spicy aoli, excellent guacamole, wonderful salsa.  Every element was right on for these tacos and I enjoyed them tremendously.  The service, ambience and food were excellent on this visit, five stars.",

I looked on my Monocole and realized that this place is directly across the street. Perfect. AND it was a Tuesday night which meant it was TV dinner night!  Thsi place is known for their grown up TV dinners on Tuesday.  I've been wanting to try this for 2 years now.  The 'fancied up\" TV dinners are served on old school compartmentalized plates and feature gourmet renditions of old tv dinner foods.  It didn't disappoint.  My dinner cosisted of an open faced roast beef sandwich with cheese, horseradish and a ciabatta bun.  Delish!  The meat was perfectly tender.  It also included butternut squah, green been casserole, salad, and a cute cherry pie!  I loved it.    What really sold me is the beer offerings.  I'm a beer snob and this place doesn't disappoint.  It's not often I can find a beer I haven't had.  This place had some new options.    My friend opted for one of the pizzas and it was divine. Large enough to share, she clearly had leftovers.  The pizza has chicken, corn, cilantro and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember. But I'll be getting a pizza next.  We sat outside and my only complaint is the misters. I know it's hot and all, but those misters leave you soaking wet. It's like I\"m back in the  South sitting outside or in the rain forest.  Holy smokes.",

I found myself scarfing down their homemade catsup with particular vigor, and I'm not a catsup lover... Or even liker. Be sure to get the poptart for desert, it's always good. Of course I have to mention the 31 craft beers on tap and the trendy, hipster ambiance; but honestly I'd come here for any one of these awesome attributes... This place has it all! Want great service? Ask for Cindy. I've sat with her a few times and she always takes great care of me.",

We could barely finish half of it, but so good  My husband ordered fish tacos as an entree which he loved and I ordered the Churchill with bacon and a side salad. Delicious! Our server was Jake (name on ticket at about 7:45-9pm on Friday 8/18). He was so friendly and attentive and I'd love to have him every time we come back, he made the first experience for us memorable. I LOVE friendly staff (I was a waitress for 5 years).  Food arrived very quickly and was just like we ordered. Very cool place that I felt was non- judgmental... Come as you are. Love this place! We will back soon",

The place did begin to fill up by the time we left an hour later. We have had beer here before, which was good, but we were sticking to food and no alcohol tonight. I could have used a good beer to wash away the taste of one of the most foul-tasting salads I have ever had. The avocado salad sounded promising and I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it had a taste that my partner described as \"stale beer.\" Yup. That was it. Something obviously went terribly wrong with the dressing. I left most of my salad untouched but our waiter didn't ask if I liked it or not. Come to think of it, we hardly saw him. I contemplated other meals I could have had for the $11.50 this lettuce monstrosity cost me while my partner ate her wings. Nothing special, she said, but she did appreciate having three different dipping sauces. Coke comes in a can so there are no refills and the iced tea tasted like the dregs of instant. Overall, it was a waste of $30.",

I get that the beer menu changes constantly so even more of a reason to make the beer selections clear and easy to read.  Other than that it was a slam dunk, home run, and touch down! In the culinary sense of course. I regret not taking any pictures of our food or beer selections so I'll do my best to describe my experience.  My company was great, the food was inventive, fresh, exciting, and passionately prepared. I had the Fun-Guy flat bread pizza... very rich and fit for two. I chose this because of the mushrooms and goat cheese... it could have used a lot more Fun-Guys and some spice! My company had the fish tacos which I definitely will get the next time I go! Possibly on my top 5 list of fish tacos and I'm originally from California! And I'm Mexican! The fish was fried to perfect crispiness perfection, the cabbage was dressed right and had that little spice you need for a fish taco of this caliber, and the beans! OOOOOH THE BEANS! All I can say is BOOM! Not your typical mexican refried beans but something from another dimension... hats off to the bean chef!   As far as the beer goes... I always fall back on my frustration about beer... Too many beers, not enough brain cells... There was like 30+ different beers on the board so I decided to get a flight as did my company. We shared, we said YUMM, and we said YUCK... All depends on what you like... if you like a diverse selection of great beers you will Love this place!  The prices were VERY reasonable, the atmosphere was comfortably loud, the people pretty, and the music... I don't remember the music... maybe they didnt have any playing... if not they should have...",

    "text": "Downtown Phoenix is by no means lacking great places to drink and/or eat. On any particular night you can leave your house walk into a few bars/restaurants and end up in some fabulous places.  One I frequent often is Angel's Trumpets Ale House.  I belly up to this bar for 2 reasons:  1). With 30 some beers on tap that rotate often, (most within the same night!)  I ALWAYS have options. I appreciate a beer adventure - trying as many as possible - so that I can broaden my beer drinking experience/knowledge.  I've found some great favorites here (ie Hopslam, Pranqster, omg GULP) It's like bringing all of the nation's best beer to one conference, located right here at Angel's Trumpets.  2). Space. There is lots of it. The spread is bright and open and with contemporary, upcycled decor - you really can't go wrong. Have a large group of people? No prob! Easy to accommodate. And with that patio in the back...give me a break! This massive patio (now with misters) is perfect for enjoying evenings under the Phoenix skyline.   But the Beer and Space can't sell this place alone. Angel's Trumpets is missing something -an energy, a feeling, an emotional attachment that is found so easily in other places like Lost Leaf, Crescent, or Brat Haus, Four Peaks and even Papago Brewery. Sometimes I feel like I'm eating in a big cafeteria hall (unless I'm on the patio) in which every conversation bounces off the walls and floors. There is never any music playing - which blows as I feel it should be a crucial part of any outing. After all, music, beer, art and food are such important aspects of the downtown culture. I'm still yearning for more - and I'm patiently waiting.",

Great selection of beers- chalkboard has title, place where it's brewed, type of beer and type of glass listed all for patrons to read. Menu is great too- my table shared \"the mess\" which is their version of poutine and it was delicious. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Great food, service & atmosphere! I brought my in laws & out of town guests tonight, we all had a wonderful time! Good variety of beer, outdoor seating while we waited for a table was perfect, very comfortable. The service was excellent; knowledgable, accommodating & friendly staff! The food.... Wow.. Worth writing a review about! as a group we chose everything from the hot wings to sausage plate for apps. Main course: grilled cheese, burrito, pizza, fish tacos & cheeseburger! All items were rated A+ by my family! I felt like a hero bringing them here! This is not your average bar food, the flavors, seasoning & creativity in each meal were great! My personal fav: Churchill grilled cheese w/ bacon jam. Yum.  Highly recommended for any gathering! :) we will be back!",

    "text": "Oh man they have an AMAZING selection of STRONG beers!  As a craft beer nerd from San Diego, the CAPITAL of craft beer south of Portland, I was impressed.  And their pork burger with fried egg was AMAZING!  I am glad i found this spot before leaving AZ.  If you like craft beer and fatty foods to go with it, this is the place.  If you like budlight and carrots....for the love of God, change your lifestyle. The 6 drink sampler is perfect for a taste, but i really wanted to try more, since their beer is of a great variety (not just a bunch of IPAs and Wheats and Belgians, but they seriously ran the gamut) .  Will return if I make my way back to Phoenix!",

    "text": "I need to point out how accommodating the staff was . . .  I visited ATAH after the Strong Beer Festival; as you might imagine the place was a mad-house.  That's an understatement.  In fact, the line to the restroom was almost out the door.  Anyway, we were put on a wait for seating.  After about an hour we were notified that a table was ready.  It was the worst table in the place - the one RIGHT next to the line of people waiting to use the restroom.  My comment to them was a bit gruff - \"hell no, I'm not sitting where I get to stare at drunk people's asses while I eat\" (my apologies to the staff).  They didn't blink an eye or even once get a snotty tone.  They were very professional.  They put us back in the list and we were seated at a better table as one came available.  Once seated we were treated to fabulous service and amazing food.  I'm going back for sure.  Again, ATAH Staff - my apologies for being a difficult patron.  You handled it very well!",

    "text": "Went here while visiting friends who suggested coming here. We had a party of 5 and arrived on a Saturday around 6pm. There was a wait, but it was not too long, probably 15-20 minutes. We sat outside after a table was ready.  I decided to go with the beer sampler special, which is any 6 beers on tap, I think it was around $11. I tried a range of different beers, from an IPA to a brown ale to a saison. I really liked the selection -- it was hard for me to decide because there were so many delicious-sounding beers to choose from! I would order 4/6 of them again, and the other 2 were just not my taste. For dinner, I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with avocado (I forget the name of it). Fries came on the side. The bread and overall taste of the sandwich was good, but unfortunately the pork was dry. My boyfriend had brisket in his sandwich, and he said his meat was also dry. At one point a piece of pork fell out of the sandwich, and I thought I was picking up a fry, but it was actually a long strand of dry meat! The fries were very good though - perfectly crispy. Our service was great...our server checked up on us the perfect amount and was quick bringing everything out.  I also really liked the vibe here. There were all kinds of people dining the night we went. Older people, young people with beautiful tattoos, a group of people wearing onesies and halloween costumes, couples, singles, etc. It was a great night for people-watching. The place was pretty packed but I never felt like it was too loud.   I would definitely come here again, and either order a different sandwich, or hope the dry meat was a fluke. I loved the vibe and the beer selection. Overall, a great place in Phoenix!",

    "text": "25+ beers on tap and none are uber mainstream!  I love discovering hidden gems in the central/downtown area and this is my latest discovery.  My mates have been raving about this place and I finally found time to grab a brew with them.  The decor is your typical modern/hipster with a twist of vintage thrown in.  The bartender that night was a lovely young lady who I recognized from Roosevelt Bar (which is now closed).  She was very knowledgeable and gave me wonderful recommendations based off of what I normally drink.    In short, this is a great place to grab a brew and reconnect with mates you haven't had time to see.  I will be here again very soon.",
