We found Irma's on Yelp and we'll be back again soon. The place looks a little sketchy from the outside but inside the wonderful smell from the kitchen hits you right away. I had the special Sope with green chile and egg and my wife had a Carne Asada bowl. Both dishes were outstanding (we always share bites). Everything was fresh, homemade, and tasty. Service was excellent and quick (Irma's daughter it turns out); we're excited to go back again and try something new. This place is worth a trip even if you don't normally find yourself in the area. Thanks for a great meal!",

Then, my $6 plate of three carne asada street tacos with rice and beans followed shortly thereafter. The food was good, but not spectacular. In all, quick service, good food, and cheap prices.

Having breakfast at a Mexican food joint is not always a great idea since I feel like I will always be getting tacos and tortillas. However this was a much different experience. There's only five or six tables in the dining area.  Tv in the dining ares and we were able to watch the morning news in an intimate setting. The owners are super sweet very welcoming and I could tell they wanted to please.  I ordered the carne picada which came with rice beans a salad and eggs over easy. The steak was the best that I have ever had and a Mexican restaurant seasoned perfectly and cooked perfectly as well. I asked her to not serve me rice and to give me extra salad since I'm doing the carb-free thing. She was very accommodating.   My husband had the chilaquiles which he absolutely loves. I have tried it before and was not a fan but today when I tried it it was very good. The tortillas were crunchy in a green chile sauce that was a little bit spicy but very well seasoned. His plate was beautiful and so was mine.   The one thing that I could say that I did not enjoy it was the coffee. It tasted like I was on an airplane which we all know is not very good. But considering that everything else was amazing that will not stop me from coming back here again. Next stop is to try them for lunch and for dinner their prices are very reasonable.",

I know it sounds strange, but it really reminds me of going to Michelin 3 star restaurants where you are made to feel absolutely at home.  Yeah...its not fancy...but that's not the point.  The people are great and the food is real.  Last time I was there with a friend who ordered a smoothie.  The woman who made it came to greet us and tell us about it, how she drinks one of them every day and how much my friend would just love it.  She was so nice and excited about our order.  She must make dozens of smoothies a day but her sincere excitement told us that every one was special.  I had a taste..and it WAS great.  This is some of the best Mexican I have had.  Chile Rellenos are excellent as is the Chimichanga.  The pork rib special, which I haven't seen anywhere else, was also very good.  Mole looked good too...next time....",

    "text": "Before I delve any further, here's what I'll be conveying in this review.  5 stars for the food.  1 star for the dining experience.  Depending on how you weigh those two things, you may come up with a different number of stars than I did.  And how you define the \"dining experience\" can of course be wide open to interpretation.  But I'll give you the full rundown on my experience and you can judge for yourself.  But just to reiterate, the food itself is awesome and a great value, so much of what I'll be sharing will echo some of the earlier Yelp reviews of Irma's.  I came here on a Sunday morning, excited by what the Yelpers were saying about this place (particularly for breakfast).  Its a tiny space (room for maybe 20 inside and 4 outside) with a tiny amount of parking (maybe 4-5 spots).  When I arrived around 8:30am the place was fairly busy, but I was able to get a small table for myself.  The young man working the front (didn't catch his name) was super courteous and took my drink order not long after I arrived (I asked for a horchata) and gave me a complimentary chips and salsa.  For whatever reason it took about 5 minutes for him to bring out my drink order.  During that time was when things got dicey.  The place is small which means if you're dining inside you're right next to the kitchen itself.  And from the time I arrived to the time I got my drink the kitchen got super smokey, to the point where the smoke was literally billowing out into the dining area.  By the time I got my horchata (which was delicious by the way), I was almost choking on the smoke.  Two customers moved to the outside tables to escape the smoke and I was about to follow suit when the head cook finally opened the windows to air out the building.  About 5 minutes later, the air was breathable again.  Nevertheless, the restaurant remained smokey (though at least tolerably so from then on), which makes me wonder what they'll do in the summer when its too hot to pop open a window or sit outside.  Yikes.  Bottomline, if you're coming here for the first time, my recommendation would be to play it safe and sit outside (if its cool enough) or get your order to go.  At least until they figure out how to solve the borderline dangerous air circulation problem here.  Now then, let's get to the good part.  The food.  Based on the food photos and the prices here I had assumed that I would need to order two dishes just to come away full and happy from this place.  After all, there can't possibly be that much food on a plate for just $4, right?  I decided to go with an order of chilaquiles (Christmas style) and a breakfast burrito.  Total cost for the food, horchata, free chips and salsa, tax and tip came to about $13.  For that cheap, I expected a pair of dishes light on portions.    Whoops.  The breakfast burrito was huge and stuffed with eggs, bacon and potatoes.  I added a little hot sauce to boot.  This alone would've left me plenty satisfied.  But a few seconds later, out came a big plate of chilaquiles (basically fried tortilla strips covered in red or green sauce, or both in my case) with eggs your way (I got scrambled), rice, beans, and lettuce.  It wasn't too spicy, but great flavors all around with just a little kick.  There was no way I was gonna finish it all and I happily took some home to finish at lunch.  And all that for just $13?  Ridiculously good deal.  So there it is.  Great food and drink.  Great value.  The restaurant itself?  That leaves much to be desired.  Like I said, the young man who served me was courteous but slow and the air circulation was bad enough that I would not recommend dining inside.  If you're coming here for take out or to dine outside while the weather is good, please do.  But come summertime, takeout may be the only way to go here.",

Three of us went inside for breakfast and were immediately met with a smiling waitress who showed us to our table. The place is small so you might have to wait during busy times, but let me tell you it is worth it.  Two of us had a Mexican breakfast and OH MY! It was delicious and plentiful.  Our other companion had pancakes and the portion filled up a 6 foot man. Looking around all we saw were happy faces and upon the walls people who were True fans wrote messages on the wall. The only reason why I had to deduct a star is because the coffee was pretty bland and typical for a fast food restaurant but not a place that served authentic food.",

You honestly do have a little bit of doubt when you first go in. You think, \"This place has a full 5 stars?\". And then the food comes.... I promise you, you will be blown away! I had the Carne Asada burrito and it was unlike anything I've ever had. And the chips and salsa! I went for lunch and wanted to go back for dinner that day. Now, great food is obviously a must for a great restaurant but what sets this place apart from the rest are the other things. First of all, the price. In a day and age where it seems like premium food is sold at a premium cost, Irma's kitchen challenges that notion! With a $4 tip, my meal of a burrito, Coke and chips and salsa (free) came out to $12; you can't beat that! On top of the price, the staff is priceless. I'm not sure if the lady working the counter was Irma herself or not but she was incredibly friendly. She was giving out free samples of a lemonade recipe she had created that included jalapeno peppers and it was unlike anything else I've ever had. She was always smiling and cheerful and sincerely happy that people were there. Please, do NOT judge this place by the location or how it looks because the food and people at Irma's is hard to beat ANYWHERE!",

The other guy also said it was the best meal of the vacation.  Our meal for 4 people including 3 ice teas came to $24.

I could tell the one line cook in the back doing my order was new as he received constant instruction from the guy at the counter. I think he accidentally used tortilla mix, because the pancakes I received looked nothing like the one's depicted here from April 2015. They were flat and rubbery...like a nasty grey-ish, flavorless crepe. The whole crew was very friendly, though, so it's sad the food wasn't awesome.",

This place popped up nearby on Yelp. We thought we would give it a try and I'm so glad we did. We walked in and were greeted by a very nice lady. This is clearly a favorite spot of the locals as many of them knew the names of everyone working there. The menu is painted on the wall and everything sounded delicious. We ended up getting the Huevos Rancheros with chorizo. It tasted great and was served with very hot and very, very fresh tortillas. Not only was this the best meal and service we've had all trip, it's the best I've had in a very long time.",

We got the chilaquilas and asada platter plus 1 coffee = $15! Can it get any better than that? Everything was so delicious! The asada was very flavorful and the chilaquiles had bonus sour cream over it, and there were cute quotes from people all over the walls. I would definitely go back for sure!",

After my first visit here, I fell victim to the incredibly delicious food and friendly atmosphere of Irma's Kitchen!!!  I average 3-4 visits a week here ever since my first visit.  Irma, Amada, Macias, Haddon,  and Julia have always warmed my heart's desire for great food and family like relationships!  With that said, the price is right and the food bursts with amazing flavors that are hinted, in one way or another, with the an authentic Guatemalan sabor (flavor).  You can't go wrong with what you order!  If you're into great tasting hamburgers, the Monster Burger will impress!  If you like the heat from spice, try the Diablo Burrito!!  It will warm your palate quickly.  No matter what you try, you will leave satisfied and with the desire to clear your lunch calendar for Irma's Kitchen each and every week!!",

The people are terrific. One night last fall I was at a small dinner party - six people - and I told them about this wonderful find, thinking I was telling them something new. Three of the other five people just raved \"Oh Irma's is one of my favorites!\" Later just before Christmas I was telling other friends about that wonderful little spot and one of them replied \"Irma's catered our Thanksgiving dinner. I've never had such a wonderful turkey.\"  I take every chance I get to introduce another friend to Irma's Kitchen. I've never had anyone say anything other than positive things and vow to return. With all the good that I know about Irma's I was surprised to see Michael P's disappointment. I hope he tries it again.",

I can honestly tell you we were beyond happy and satisfied after our experience and all the great reviews are 100% True.   Although we wanted to try everything we managed (somehow) to narrowed it down to carne asada tacos, the tampiquena and cheese quesadilla. Both were outstandingly delicouse. The chili rellenos that came with the tampiquenas were the best I've ever had.  And I shouldn't forget to mention the free chips and salsa which were fresh and a great starter to your meal.  So in conclusion-It's clean, service is great and the food is outstanding.  All the right ingredients for a solid 5 star review.  We will be back for sure on first Friday and again anytime we are in the area. It's so worth it for a place that makes you feel happier then you did before coming in.",

Doesn't look like much on the outside but the interior is clean and quant (actually outside looks like a dump, but don't let that scare you off.)  First their fresh juice is delicious and was only $3.59 (I seriously paid $11 for a 24 oz that did not taste 1/2 as good as the 32 oz - saw them put in all the fresh veggies and fruits so I know it wasn't powder).   My son who hate Mexican food asked if we could go back for their beef burrito.  My other child had fluffy pancakes, perfectly done thick bacon and eggs for only $5.  Service was also friendly and efficient.  Interior is small so I can this place being packed on peak hours.  We had no problem being seated at 1pm on a Saturday.  Great food, good service and the price is a steal.",

I had the chicken tacos & the chicken was very dry. My BF had chicken mole & his chicken was also dry. We shared some chicken flautas & they were the best out of the 3 items we ordered.

I had the chilaquiles Christmas style with over med eggs. He had the lunch special with a beef tamale and a cheese enchilada. Both were super tasty. They brought out chips and salsa first, which was fresh and surprisingly spicy (in a good way). My chilaquiles were delish... spicy, flavorful, great with the beans and the eggs... even the little unnecessary salad was good and added nice flavor to the dish. The husband's food was equally tasty, the tamale was wonderful with tender meat inside and complimented by their red sauce. The prices were ridic low. We will be back!",

Shout-out to the red chile pork ribs, veggie burrito, chilaquiles breakfast burrito, caldo de pollo, and cream of shrimp soup! Also the lemonade & jamaica (pronounced \"ha-my-ca,\" not like the island) is so refreshing and floral. Totally worth squeezing into the parking lot and cozy dining area.

    "text": "Trying to get to this place was a bit tricky since it is right at the intersection on Grand, Roosevelt and 19th ave, parking spots are very limited. Once you are inside, you will be welcomed by your family (that is literally how it feels like, just like when visiting relatives that you've never met before). My two sisters and I agreed the horchata, is the BEST HORCHATA in town. We had a variety of foods from breakfast lunch and appetizers all at once, since we wanted to try everything and share family style, instead of getting a dish for each of us. The red salsa for the chips was sooo good, better than the green in my opinion. I wish that is what would have been used for my other dishes but they use the traditional red chile sauce. We ordered: red chilaquiles, this is probably the first time I have had chilaquiles just like my grandma makes them, usually places will just have chips smothered in chile and call it a day, not here. Topped with queso freso, crema, frijoles refritos and yellow rice. Next we had huevos rancheros, I went with red on one egg and green on the other, topped with avocado slices and rice + beans on the side, this was my favorite dish out of all. From the lunch menu we had a red cheese enchilada, that one was ok, i think by then we have had a lot of red chile sauce so we weren't surprised. We also had an american platter: pancakes and eggs, pancakes were nice and fluffy, reminded me of mcdonalds' pancake batter but bigger and better. One of my sisters had carne asada fries, personally I didn't like them, but she did. She said they were better than Filiberto's, and she eats carne asada fries regularly. Service was excellent, and the food was great. Prices are so cheap, portions are sure to fill you up. When we left, Irma, the chef and owner, (I think that was her) was greeting customers in and out by the door, you can tell she loves what she does.",

It's not much from the outside but don't let it deter you from going inside. The people are so warm and friendly! This is a mom and pop small business and they are just getting started but the food was very good. We ordered the breakfast burrito and chilaquiles and they were both delicious. I like my chilaquiles spicier so if you want more fire make sure to ask. The salsas that came out with the chips had a great kick. The menu was simple and had 5 or 6 things listed for breakfast, lunch and dinner which made deciding a lot easier. I then made my way across the street to treehouse bakery for a cookie.

Don't be fooled by the facade of this restaurant, the food's presentation and quality : 5 stars. I ordered the fish tacos. The refried bean is so smooth in texture and best of all not very salty and you could actually taste the inherent taste of the beans. The rice is so tasty and again salted just right that you could actually appreciate the taste of the rice and other ingredients added to it. The rice is cooked just right that it doesn't feel soggy or taste too salty. Best part are the fish tacos which are NOT fried, nor dry or hard to bite , the fish is tender and cooked just right and not loaded with salt. It's truly cooked with care. Whereas other restaurants load their dishes with salt or butter that's it's difficult to appreciate the actual taste of the ingredients, these dishes are perfectly cooked.  The other dishes like pancake or the salsa is ok.  Eggs are good a little undercooked but still taste really good. The staff are friendly and truly cares about giving good customer service. There's a family feel to it and the walls have written notes from visitors all over the world who visited this restaurant and liked it.",

Irma's is a very small restaurant with maybe 4 or 5 small tables (4 tops at most). It's kind of the picture of a mom and pop, Mexican version and Irma is the cook with I assume a young family member running the counter  The salsa that comes with fresh chips is different from any other I've had, it almost looks like chicken soup, yellowish, clear and very flavorful. I had the chicken fajitas, which came with a giant flour tortilla that was as hot as hades. The chicken breast pieces (not cheaper thigh meat) were large and perfectly cooked through yet juicy and tender. Squash, onions and peppers add to the fajita mix.  Rice and refried beans and an apple slice with grapefruit slice on shredded lettuce fill out the plate. I was stuffed when I finished and there was no way I was going to leave anything this good on the plate! All that and a refillable fountain soda for less than $10.00.  Support a really nice if little neighborhood restaurant if you're in Phoenix, and go to Irma's.",

    "text": "THANK YOU, fellow Yelp-ers, for sending me to Irma's. Although the menu is somewhat limited (altering regularly and super fresh), the food itself is more authentic, delicious, prepared with abundant care, and surprisingly inexpensive. Moreover, the atmosphere is like a mini-trip to Mexico: the music and vibe setting the background, Irma herself is tending to the grill outdoors and everyone around her is more than just concerned with your happiness, but with making you feel like welcome long-lost relatives. Very rarely is the whole experience as worthy as the food, which is what you came for, and upon driving up, my friends were questioning my choice, but Irma's Kitchen is an UNEXPECTEDLY wonderful surprise - and we all want to go back and spend more time there. Definitely nothing like other restaurants, never mind Mexican restaurants - more like here are our Mexican cousins in Phoenix - we hope they like us enough to have us back.",

A buddy of mine told me that I need to go check out Irma's kitchen on 15th Ave!  First of all you can't get scared to go in, because of the neighborhood, and if you have to park on Garfield street and walk over to Irma's just do it.  Lots of times the best places are small and not in the best area's!  All I can say is there's lot of Love coming out of this Kitchen!  Everyone is so friendly, and when I say this is small, I mean maybe 16 people max can sit in here at one time!  The salsa is wonderful.  The Chicken Soup I was served today was probably the best I've ever had, and the rice is perfection!  I'll definitely be back and will tell my foodie friends who I know will love this place!  Prices are extremely cheap for this quality of food and service!  I'm so glad I went here today!  Just a very special little place that reminds me of eating at my Grandma's house as a kid, and she could seriously cook.  If you can relate to that, then by all means come here!  These are good people, that cook with Love and genuinely appreciate their customers!",

Some of the food is a little different so they take their time explaining and helping you get what you want. Secondly, the food! So good! It is very authentic, a mix between Mexican and Guatemalan style food.  Get in contact with her if you want her to cater a party for you - it will be  an exciting and different experience! *** They are going to be moving in the very near future.

Irma herself came to check on us (and serve us in between mixing up some outrageously delicious Mexican meals). They started out by serving homemade tortilla chips with 4 different salsas which were all amazing. We each got something different. Most got tacos (my favorite was shredded beef, my mom loved chicken), and my dad got chilaquiles which I couldn't stop eating. Highly recommend this place!",

Irma is a really nice older lady who treats you like family and makes you feel like you are eating at home.    I ordered the Chorizo and Eggs (OUTSTANDING!).   My wife ordered the breakfast burrito.  The kids got the pancakes, eggs, and bacon.  Everything was delicious.  Not only was the food spot on and portions good sized .... it was also extremely reasonable.  Where else can you find breakfast for $3.99?  Are you kidding me?  She should be charging closer to $6.99 - $7.99 for the plates.  Give this place a try and support your local small business!",

From the moment we arrived we were greeted warmly and allowed to sit where we want. Though it wasn't that big and spacious in the place it wasn't cramped either. We were given tortilla chips and nachos whilst we decided what to order and the salsa which came with them were to die for. We looked through the menu and were shocked at how cheap everything was and wrongly assumed it would be small portions which it wasn't.  I got three tacos which were fantastic and the rice and beans on the side were just as good.  My girlfriend ordered the Mexican meatball soup and loved it as much as I loved my tacos. Everything was flavoured perfectly and the hint of mint in the meatballs made everything really light and fresh tasting.  I got a burrito to go since everything was so good and that was my only slight downfall of the place. The burrito was very small and didn't contain much filling meaning the tortilla had been double wrapped and the whole thing tasted a bit doughy.  Other than that we loved it to bits and would come back every time we were in Phoenix. What a wonderful little place.",

Also because its Tuesday, you can order a single taco for $1.25. Meat was okay though, not best. I like the asada usually more charred.

I trekked downtown to this secluded spot on a cloudy and chilly day in the hopes that a bowl of albondigas would warm the depths of my soul.  My experience started out okay as I was greeted warmly when I entered the restaurant and offered some chips and salsa.  However, once my order arrived I was let down. The albondigas had only three meatballs, half a potato, and a few slices of carrots.   The majority of the soup consisted of cabbage. Also, the broth was not very flavorful and a little watery.   It might be that I have been spoiled because my friend has made me albondigas from her family recipe. But whatever the case may be, I was really let down by my experience.",

    "text": "Love, love this place!!!! Found it on Yelp as a close by, highly rated location to an event we were heading to in the downtown Phoenix. So incredibly glad we came in and met Irma and her staff and shared breakfast in what felt like her own home kitchen. We were treated like family, truly cared about, fed like kings and it was awesome!  The place is tiny, maybe seven tables at the most. To say the atmosphere is \"casual\" would be an understatement. It felt very much like family, not only Irma and the staff, but the other patrons as well, it's as if once you walk through the door, you've known everyone for years, everyone is instantly that type of family that you love to be around and it makes you feel genuinely happy. Oh, and you're all hanging out it grandma's kitchen.  The food was stellar! We both had the Chilaquiles with chips and different salsas, yummmm!! There is absolutely no doubt that Irma has been cooking these same recipes for decades and puts love into everything she does. Her happiness, sweetness and personal attention is absolutely contagious, she feels like that grandma that makes you feel \"home\".  The prices are ridiculously low. So low, in fact, that we simply paid more when the check came. Not because we had to, because it was genuinely worth it and appreciated! It's hard to beat the service here, it's basically like sitting at your kitchen table, with your grandma and favorite aunt in the kitchen and then asking if they can get you anything and ensuring you're 100% taken care of. Course, my grandma would never in a million years hand me a black sharpie marker and ask me to sign the wall, but Irma did :-)  This is truly an amazing experience that you should NOT pass up if you have an opportunity to experience Irma's Kitchen. I can't wait to return, it will be the first breakfast place I choose anytime I am in downtown Phoenix. Don't miss this place, it will likely be a \"forever memory\" for you as it was for us.",

The staff are friendly, this is a very casual place... seems like you stop by a good friends house or your tias. The chips are homemade, we were given a red salsa, a green and a separate cup of hot salsa, I only tried the green and it was good seems homemade. I ordered chorizo eggs potatoes with rice and beans. Everything was good, it reminded me of home cooking... nothing fancy or extravagant but like what you would make at home.

The meal also came with homemade chips and salsa that will cause hand battles amongst your fellow diners. They serve a mild, but tasty salsa with the chips, but if your palate needs something with a little more pop, just ask and you shall receive. Parking is a little scrunchy (as is the seating) and the neighborhood may make you sing the theme from the TV show Cops, but the food is worth the adventure.",

First of all if you are here on a Friday, you must eat the fall off the bones red Chile pork ribs with fresh tortillas! Prior to the delicious food I could not keep the chips and salsa out of my mouth. Only issue you might encounter is the parking, it's a bit is precarious and it is a very small place with like 6 tables, but don't let that stop you from eating some authentic delicious Mexican food. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. Also our waiter was super friendly and knowledgeable regarding tastes and let's you make your own meal!!",

They do a good job in making sure we were taken care of during our stay. Our food came out quickly and tasted great!  They have a small parking lot. If it is full then you need to go park down the next street in front of the houses.  Overall, I was impressed by the speed, service and the taste of the food. I recommend everyone to try this place out if you are in the area. You won't be disappointed!",

I had a carne asada burrito with rice and beans, and it was delicious, despite being really cheap. (The chips and salsa are free, too.) At the end of our meal, Irma herself came out and checked on us, which is a nice touch, in my opinion. All in all, a great find and something that will be added to my list of lunchtime restaurants.",

Irma provided us excellent service - she adds special touches such as bringing a pitcher of water w/sliced oranges and lemons instead of just bringing a glass of water; she also shared with us her special extra hot salsa which was very tasty - and yes spicy!   We ordered the green chilaquiles/egg and the steak picado/egg; both dishes were delicious and portions are large - the flour tortillas were freshly made.  The prices are amazing - most dishes range from $4 to $6.  I will definitely come back to Irma's Kitchen next time I am in town.    Thank you Irma for your amazing Mexican cooking!!!!",

The taco was delicious and flavorful and I also loved the beans and cheese. The tamale was a little dry in my opinion but still good. Everything is priced very reasonably! You really can't beat the price for what you're getting. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area and looking for some good, cheap Mexican food!",

When you dine in, you get chips and all of these delicious salsas in fancy bowls.  We had the tamale plate with tacos, carne asada and chicken, and a bean & cheese burrito.  All of this was amazing minus the grizzle in the carne. The tamale sauce (red) was phenomenal and the tortillas were all very fresh so the beans didn't spill out of the burrito and the tacos remained intact.   Dinner and lunch plates came with a pineapple and orange slice and shredded lettuce.  Our server, Irma's daughter was super sweet and very friendly.",

    "text": "Only open for 8 days as of this writing, this is based on my first and only experience at Irma's Kitchen and it consisted solely of a generous sized breakfast burrito and a thoroughly pleasant hole in the wall dining experience. Don't take that negatively, Irma's is the kind of tiny, family run place that give's \"hole in the wall\"  a good name.       A friendly greeting from Irma welcomed me to the tiny establishment, home of numerous previous eateries in same space near intersection of 15th Avenue, Grand and Roosevelt. The name is \"Irma's Kitchen\" although one of the exterior signs also says \"Irma's Mexican and American Food\".  The writing, as in the menu, is literally on the wall at Irma's.  The American part consisting of French toast and pancakes at breakfast, hamburgers, ham & cheese sandwiches, and I'm sure another item or two I missed but shouldn't have, considering the entire menu is painted quite neatly on the walls before me.  The curtained  windows and touch or two of simple wall decor give a personal touch and warmth to the dining area furnished with simple tables and chairs.  As to the food  I can only say my single ham & cheese & potato breakfast burrito, was truly best in class of similar tried at a good number of establishments, not dry, truly tasty, of generous size and quite filling, but not the overwhelming full-grown dachshund size burrito served at some establishments (which are fine, but just a bit too much and too heavy for my appetite and tastes most of the time).  If everything on the menu is as good, you can count this place as \"a find\".  And affordable?  As of this date, March 14, 2015, this cost a paltry $3.99+ tax.   I look forward to going back and trying more of the writing on the wall, and at the prices listed, feel I can afford to. Next time you're on Grand for First Friday or having a sip at the Bikini Lounge and hunger strikes, try Irma's.They're open until 10 p.m., and I think you will find it an unpretentious, super-affordable and satisfying addition to the hood.",

    "text": "With a very early flight to Phoenix, we were hungry upon arrival and so I Yelped breakfast burritos and found many positive reviews of a small place a little off the beaten path in Phoenix called Irma's Kitchen.  We had a great time and a great breakfast here!  It only has a few tables and we were there early in the morning around 7:45 AM, and for the short time we were there, several familiar loyal local customers came in, so you can tell this place has a following.  Authentic Mexican food and we always like to go to local restaurants when we travel.  The service was great, we were greeted warmly by both Irma and our server, who got us water and took our coffee order immediately.  The breakfast burrito was what my wife was there for, and I got the chilaquiles.  Both were excellent.  The burrito was not too spicy, so my wife liked that, it had eggs, ham and potato (maybe bacon?) and the tortilla itself was really tasty, let alone the ingredients inside of it.  I tried it, and I liked it too.  My chilaquiles were excellent as well, in fact I liked that the tortilla pieces at the bottom were not all soggy like they sometimes are when I get this dish elsewhere.  They still had a little bit of crunch to them.  You can get them with either red or green sauce, and I went with green and it was great, it didn't overwhelm the dish at all and complemented it really well.  The eggs were right over top of the rest of the dish, and I liked that you could break the yolk and let it drip into the rest of the dish and combine it all.  VERY tasty dish!   We found Irma charming, a really nice personable woman who cares about her cooking and her customers.  And we spoke to a man (I don't want to assume it's her husband, because I don't know that) and he was great, too.  Lunch and dinner menu looked great, by the way, as well.  We just really enjoyed the entire dining experience overall, the food itself, the service, and the interaction with the staff.  We will definitely return to Irma's when back in Phoenix.  It's not a fancy restaurant, it's an authentic local Mexican restaurant (although they actually  have hummus too) with great food and great people.",

I'm a vegetarian and was super impressed with the Chile relleno plate which came with a cheese enchilada, beans, and rice. The relleno was amazing- covered in a homemade green chile sauce and filled to the brim with cheese. I also loved the homemade red sauce on the cheese enchilada and could have eaten a plate of those alone! I ordered guacamole on the side and was pleasantly surprised to see that it was more of an avocado cream sauce, omg so tasty! My husband ordered the mole plate and said the mole was delectable. The salsas that came with the chips were also delicious and our waiter even brought us out a sampler of special hot habanero salsa, I can still taste the burn! I didn't catch our waiter's name but he was such a friendly and helpful guy, we loved chatting with him and wish we hadn't had to scoot out so quickly to catch our flight! We were also lucky to meet Irma herself- what a charming woman with a warm personality who helped us visitors from Seattle see the bright side of a rainy day in the Southwest =)",

If you are looking for a good quick bite at a very very reasonable price this is your spot!   The menu is a bit on the smaller side but that's okay, they make up for it in the size of the portions. The young woman who seems to be the owner is VERY sweet and is super friendly! She seems to be the only one ever working but she does a great job at keeping up with the customers and kitchen staff.  I've tried the albondigas soup, tortilla salad, burritos, etc... everything has been surprisingly great! My only critique would be that the chicken used in the taco salad is so juicy that it actually makes the taco bowl soggy. Besides that everything including their homemade chips and salsa is great!   The inside is a little small so if you go with more than two people be prepared to be seated super close to the next table!   All in all I really like this place and will continue to support this small local business",

My colleague and I opted for takeout, and while we were waiting for our food, one of the employees took a burrito and a bottle of water out to a homeless man in the parking lot. This warmed my heart, and was definitely not something you'd see at a chain restaurant.  Trust me. Just do it. Go to Irma's. Your tastebuds will thank you.",

    "text": "So I'm not too big in Mexican food especially not so early in the morning. but my boyfriend LOVES Mexican food. So when we saw this place that had both pancakes and Mexican food we jumped on it.  Let's start talking about the food first. I got the pancakes. He got the breakfast burrito, chicken soup. Irma came out with chips and salsa and they were HELLA good. You could taste the freshness of the tomatoes and the chips were perfectly crisp with a sprinkle of salt on top. My bf didn't take too long to finish it and Irma got him seconds. The chicken soup was also amazing, the chicken was tender and the broth was also very flavorful. I thought the burrito was amazing too but my bf thought it was a little too salty (I just think he was too full to enjoy it fully). I don't think I've ever wanted to praise a tortilla before. It was cheesy and every bite was a burst of flavor in my mouth. I think my American breakfast was ok, not too memorable. I would definitely go for the Mexican stuff next time we're here. Although I don't know when that'll be since we're not from here :(  The place is small and clean and you'll be greeted with a smile by Irma. There's a tv in the background that's not too loud. There was people coming in and Irma greeted everyone like family. Eating here just made me feel all fuzzy and warm. Probably how you feel when gma is making amazing food just for you.   The price is ridiculously cheap. The total for us was about $16. We got three dishes and a coffee. Even with a generous tip that's less than $25. They also take card (they even take Amex).   Give this place a try if you like Mexican food or even if you don't like Mexican food. You'll leave the place stuffed feeling all warm and fuzzy.",

This place has the best breakfast  burrito I ever have tasted. Miss Irma is so gracious and kind:) you can taste it from her food. Here's the 5 reason why this place should be supported.  1. Locally owned. Heart warming welcome when you get to the door. 2. Clean. Let me emphasize that, very clean. Just check their staff wearing gloves when they serve you:) 3. Price. That price. Check the pictures:) 3.99 for a burrito! 4. Presentation, for a small place their presentation is very impressive. 5. The flavor. Just come and try.   Iam so sure youll like this place that iam willing to  pay your food if you don't like it. For Less than 5 bucks and you'll have a new place to eat.  :) the place is small and in a very hard to find. But I tell you. The trip to this place is worth it.   Again less than 10 bucks for a great food. So great I am pretty sure you'll like it.  Update: brought my family back to taste Miss Irma's cooking. My mom said her beef soup is one of the best beef soup she tasted here, in the valley. That's a compliment that's hard to get. My Family also loved how Miss Irma always comes and say \"hi\" to their customers. This place  just made my family a believer of local small local businesses. Hope this place gets more attention;)   Yelpers come and try their foods.",

Everything is cooked to order and comes out piping hot!  I love that Irma is always making suggestions about adding ingredients to a dish or offering samples of new items. It keeps things interesting and I've never had a bad tasting dish here. Hope they keep getting business and stick around for a long time!
