The thing that struck me with the food was the high quality of ingredients.  Mi Abuelo's Manjar with the eggs over medium is a perfect dish that really comes together when the egg yolk gets in the mix.  The prices are very reasonable and the courtyard in the center of the restaurant is stunning!  The first time I ate here, I was so impressed that I got a gift card for some friends to come and have some for themselves.  Give Abuelo's a try and you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Abuelo's bills itself as an Embassy of Mexican Food, and the posh decor certainly sets the stage. Picture this: shopping in Caesar's Palace with recessed fluorescent lighting trimming a domed ceiling, Dia De Los Muertos and Latin artistic touches in the plentiful paintings (including a pairs shot of Frida Kahlo and Alejandro Gomez Arias), many well-appointed nooks for dining with relative separation from the din, and hints of rural Spanish cathedrals.  Only a verbose description properly corrals the elements of this experience - a feast for the eyes. That is only matched by the feast found on their menu. I position my rating by saying that the food is slightly more traditional, with less focus on fusion combos and more on the individual flavors of key ingredients. I recommend the layered dip, with seasoned ground beef, melted queso, guac, sour cream and peppers. A lovely starter that is easily shared by two. And the complementary salsa is above average, with a well-thought-out single serving bowl per person.  The Green Chile Stew (while John, our server, raved about it) was ok. I love spice; however, the black pepper overpowered the green chiles. The beef was tender but sinewy at points; and the potatoes seemed an afterthought, having not fully absorbed the flavor of the sauce. I wanted to try the Cilantro Lime (chicken with pozole), but it was not available on that visit.  Also, the Espinaca Casserole had some great spinach but only one piece of mushroom and no noticeable peppers, as promised on the menu. Oddly, it included corn, which was not mentioned. Won't venture there again.  My dinner companion had the \"linebacker's meal,\" as she called it (saving the leftovers for her hubby). It was the well-priced $14.95 Monterrey, with sour cream chicken enchilada, avocado enchilada, spinach enchilada, chicken ranchera enchilada, cheese chile relleno, crispy chicken taco and guacamole. The plate was scorching and the selection was amazing; something worth testing with a friend. She said it was all good but not terribly memorable.  Highlight of the trip was the service. I would have likely come back to try other selections, like some of the seafood dishes and margaritas; still, the hospitality, the attentiveness, the genuine listening skills and the efficiency will definitely make this a repeat venue.  So, be sure to sample a sampler and take a leisurely walk around the restaurant to acquaint yourself with the art, statues and murals. Tell Frida, I said \"hi.\"",

Had to move booths because the first booth and seats were so spread apart we had to literally sit at the edge of  our seats to reach the table. 2. Decor/ style was over indulgent for a Mexican restaurant and reminded me of a cheap version of the Venetian hotel in Vegas. Very tacky. 3. If you are looking for a cool, hip restaurant this isn't it.  4. Margarita was good but gone after just a few drinks.  For $10 I expected a bit more grande than what I got. 5. Jalapeno fritters were the best thing I ate. They we're served warm. Asked server if I could get hot ones and he replied somewhat annoyed and confused \" do you want me to throw them back in the fryer?\"  Enough said there. (The manager did return with hot ones and did not charge us for the item.) 6. Yes, they have 3 types of salsa....and that's about it.  The green one is just plain offensive. Not sure how that one found its way into a so called authentic Mexican restaurant. It was also very challenging to scoop out salsa from the small tin bowls when they come about a 1/4 full. 7. Ordered fajitas. Let's see...flavorless and waaaay overlooked. Just plain bad!  Not sure what people like so much about this food. I'd rather go to Chipotle.",

I was pleased to find this Chandler location and have come here at least a half a dozen times. The building, decor and dining experience is excellent. The service has always been superb and friendly. The salsa is good and I enjoy the enchiladas. You should come to this restaurant for those reasons. If you want truly \"authentic\" Mexican food then book a US Airways Flight to Puerto Vallarta or dine in a hole in the wall restaurant in South Phoenix but then B.Y.O.G (Bring Your Own Glock)",

On the plus side, the the Dip Sampler appetizer was one of the best I had.  But the service was very slow even when our waitress went down to 3 tables.  My wife's drink, ordered when we sat down, took 20 minutes to arrive.  She had a special request for the drink and it was ignored.  I had the Beef & Cheese Chimichanga.  It was VERY BAD.  The ground beef was either old or spoiled and it tasted sour.  I took two bites and stopped.  The waitress looked at me and said, \"You don't like it?  Still deciding, huh?\"  and then walked away.  She came back 15 minutes later and I kindly requested that it be taken off the bill.  She said a manager would come by the table, but he or she never did.  The charge was taken off the bill.  My wife's entree - the Juarez - and my daughter's Child's Beef Taco were fine.  My son's Fajita Tacos looked liked they were literally thrown together with no attempt at presentation.  When my family was finished eating their entrees, the waitress said she would bring the check and didn't ask us if we would like dessert or anything else.  Some may chalk off  my bad experience to it being Mother's Day, but if  restaurant can't give good service and great food when busy, why would you want to go there in the first place?",

My only complaint is that you can't get the happy hour price if you are eating at the restaurant - which is just 5 feet away.

Yummy chips and salsas were served right away. While looking over the menu, looking for vegan options, we thought we had options figured out, but asked and were mistaken. The server knew the ingredients of many of the vegetarian options and was able to let us know which had hidden animal fluids. She customized some items for us and everything was delicious.

We like the dip trio app (queso, creamy guac, and chili con queso), fajitas, Laredo & Juarez combo plates, chicken medallions and build your own enchilada plate. The papas are delish, like Mexican cheesy mashed potatoes. The refried beans and rice are really well-seasoned as well. Our picky toddler makes \"mmmmm\" grunting noises whenever he eats the food here. You KNOW it's good. If it's your first time, you can't go wrong with a combo plate, which is awesome when I'm indecisive.   Margaritas and sangria are great and you always get your money's worth with the booze when you get them on the rocks. I was tipsy after one of the smaller size of the house margarita. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I had the privilege of visiting the establishment last night because I was in the area and I had a $25 gift card that was given from Christmas last year.  I was quite excited - I get to use my gift card and I don't have to pay for my whole meal!  Score!  So we get to the restaurant and the ambiance and decor remind me of a dim Cheesecake Factory - restaurant was open, nice, and chain-like. We get seated and we order the sangria. Sangria was good and strong - my kind of drink!  Then we get the complimentary chips and salsa - eh, ok.  My bf and I order the Monterrey.  It was a big plate enough for two people: Sour cream chicken enchilada, avocado enchilada, spinach enchilada, chicken ranchera enchilada, cheese chile relleno, crispy chicken taco and guacamole.   We started chowing down and every bite I took tasted like the last - no matter which part of the plate I was eating. The food was bland and lacked flavor.  I was so disappointed!  Luckily, my sangria was kicking in, so my disappointment did not ruin my happy mood.  The check came and for the two of us, we spent close to $50.",

They immediately brought hot tortilla chips (the thin, crispy, delicious kind) and 3 different varieties of salsas (fire roasted, verde, and traditional).  We ordered our drinks and meals and all was delivered timely and in perfect quantities. My husband and I had the steak and chicken fajitas. Others in our party had the chicken enchiladas with varied sauces. They stated that the \"cream sauce with jalapenos was out of this world!\" We got a pitcher of Dos Equis Amber and a carafe of sangria for the table to share. We eventually had 2 more people join us and they were very gracious in accommodating them! Our servers Margarita and Damaris were excellent and very friendly. It's a great restaurant  and I would highly recommend it!!",

Service was lacking, we had to stop our server to get our apps ordered and then again to order our entrees. I ran out of water and beer, and I wasn't the only one in our party waiting on drinks. The biggest complaint would be we could not order a shredded beef burro deep fried. Yep, you heard correctly a mexican food place that cant/wont deep fry a burro. Chicken, yes, but not the beef. no explanation from the server, just, \"we don't do that\". We went as a birthday dinner and sadly the bday boy could not get what he wanted.  Lousy experience.",

For my sides, I chose the spinach casserole and their mashed potatoes. The sides were a delicious change of pace to the rice and beans that I usually get. My counterpart enjoyed the fajitas and the cervezarita, and the only thing he would have changed would have been more peppers with the fajitas (as it was mostly onion).   Service - The service we received was prompt and attentive.   Atmosphere - Dim lighting with a cool vibe and jovial feel.",

    "text": "Wife and I have been going to Abuelos for years, so when we feel like Mexican food there was no other place we considered. We like it so much we drive out of our way to eat there. We frequent Abuelos where ever we find them including but not limited Phoenix, Chandler and Kansas City MO.   So for my wife and I to give a 1 star should hopefully get the attention of the owners. We were extremely disappointed with the food and lack of service during our last few visits to the Chandler location. I would bet on it that the management were not there yesterday during our visit because there was a lack luster attention to service period.   We arrived at 330pm, to find 3 seated tables and a bunch of staff some making eye contact with us as we stood there waiting to be seated. As we stood in the lobby waiting to be seated for 10mins, I turned around to walk out before my wife waved down a waiter who noticed us when we first walked in to seat us. The host was no where to be found but did show as the waiter grabbed the menus. Out of the corner of my eye the host gave our waiter a dirty look, yes I did see that rudeness coming from the host with long black hair. I'm kinda glad someone decided to do her job. But after the food and service, I should have went with my gut feeling and walked out. After all, going to eat at the odd hour has its chance of being served leftover dried out food, but I felt Abuelos was a different place to eat, NOT SO.    The Pasta La Paz my favorite was lacking sauce, the chicken was dried up leftovers from lunch and had been placed under the salamander to heat then left on the counter to cool to less than room temp when served. My wife's fajitas tacos where not fajita stips but chopped up leftover beef from the lunch.   We pushed out empty drink glasses to the edge of the table for refills which finally got filled after 15mins. We could not wait to get out of there, we are so disappointed since we loved this place so much.   We started noticing this on the last few visits, when we have ate there during off hours. Sadly,  I won't spend another $40 to find out if they have change, that was our purpose for our recent visit. We enjoyed our multiple monthly visits to Abuelos, but that will not be the case any longer.   Hope this helps improve on what once was a great experiences for us.",

My fajitas were yummy, I was pleased to find a variety of veggies (not just standard onions/green peppers) on my skillet. The portion was just right, enough for 3 tortillas w/no leftovers. Our server was nice/attentive but didn't not hover or ask questions when our mouths were full.   The interior reminds me of a Vegas type of \"courtyard\"  restaurant enclosed in a hotel. Weird. Anyway, we'll definitely be back.",

Okay so I was looking at the menu and I decided to order a classic chimichanga Mexican dish. It looked good because generally the pictures are to display the quality of the food. I was totally wrong! When I received my chimichanga it was so small! I asked for beef which usually comes shredded, but it came out in chunk sizes and it tasted smoked and uncooked. Lastly, they used nacho cheese instead of regular sprinkled cheese to go along with the beef. Very disappointed in such a fancy looking place :(",

The restaurant seemed clean and well lit.  We were greeted by a smiley face and seated right away. Chips and three types of salsa along with drinks were brought to our table as soon as we seat down. We ordered: Chicken Fajita, Chili Rellnos and Tilapia Veracruz. If you are looking to have a nice dinner with your family or a romantic dinner with your honey and you like good Americanized Mexican food, I definitely recommend Abuelo's.",

Last visit I used a side order of the glaze as salad dressing in my fajita salad and it was great.  Bacon wrapped pork medallions with enchiladas are another favorite.   Chimichangas, burritos, enchiladas, salads are all excellent.  Everyone who visits us in Tempe we bring to Abuelo's and they all love it.   Service has also always been excellent.  Perhaps a bit expensive, but I think it's worth it. My favorite place to eat in the Phoenix area (right up there with In-N-Out burger)",

I expected a run of the mill average restaurant, but Abuelo's is not that.  This is a a very open high ceiling restaurant with a cloud painted ceiling and a large statue in the center.  It almost reminded me of mini fancy las Vegas casino shopping area.  I was clean and well lit.  The food was great.  The chips and salsa were a step above a normal Mexican restaurant.  The were served with 3 salsa's.  One tasted a little sweet (I think it had kiwi in it).  It is my new favorite.  The enchiladas were good.  The chili relleno was Dynamite.   The portions were huge.  The service was great.  Jyna did a great job!  We were seated quickly, the food was served quick and the server kept our drinks topped off.    Overall I would highly recommend stopping by this great Mexican restaurant.",

(we should have gotten.s. the clue)   The bill came  and the wine was $10.75 each    $21.50 for two glasses. Yikes.

Our waitress was very attentive and courteous and knew the menu well. We started off with the house guacamole and the complimentary salsas. The guacamole was good and fresh. The house salsas run the gamut of basic tomato, a pineapple tomatillo, and roasted pepper. Definitely something for everyone. For dinner I had the ribeye with two enchiladas of your choice and my dad had just the enchiladas. The steak was done well, and the hand made enchiladas were great. I filled one with cheese and the other with shredded beef and topped it with their green Chile sauce. My dad both his with cheese and red sauce. Although I had a perfect amount of sauce, to the point that I could wipe up the excess with my steak, my dad says he could have used more. I had to pot beans which were serviceable along with the potatoes which are mashed and mixed with a Chile Queso, very tasty. My dad had retired with his but he said they were a bit dry and ended up mixing them with a bit of guacamole. On a side note, my dad thinks the avocado could have been mashed more but I thought it was fine; be sure to ask if you want it smoother. I had the house made flan which was outstanding and highly recommended. Almost forgot, I had their house margarita, the \"el hefe\" which was a nicely mixed drink with top shelf toquilla, orange liquor, and served with grilled orange. They serve it with the mixer so you get about 2 and a half drinks out of it. Price wise, we spent $80 which seems about the average for two people here. If you're in the area, definitely recommend stopping by Abuelo's!",

Although the building itself is grandiose and looks like a palace with an interior courtyard, lots of artwork and such, the food and service weren't great.  To begin, I wasn't impressed with our server. He forgot a few requests and when I asked if I could try another side sauce for my enchilada he failed to mention the extra 50 cent charge. That's a major pet peeve of mine- failing to mention you're going to up charge someone for something is a big no no. When I told him, he offered to take it off, which I declined because that's not the point. You need to let people know in advance if you're going to do that.   The food also just wasn't great. This was the most bland guacamole I think I've ever had in my life. The three table salsas and chips were ok. Not one of my three different kinds of enchiladas were flavorful and they all seemed to be smothered in cheese. The kids meal beef taco was extremely greasy.   Overall wasn't a fan and don't need to return.",

The papas con chile & rice are delicious sides which I opt to get every time (instead of the beans).  They have lunch prices for these items which are very affordable & the portions are pretty large too. The dinner prices are only a little bit higher with slightly larger portions, still worth the cost.  If you're really hungry (or going to share a dish), then the fajita options are great because they're really big & super tasty too! Their margaritas are strong and make for the perfect start to the meal. The salsas they offer with the chips are different than they typical ones. There's a light green one that tastes sweet to start off with but definitely has a kick to it. They also have a regular mild salsa & a hotter one.  I will agree with some of the other reviewers that the service is kind of off sometimes. We've gone during lunch time and they've tried to seat us in a corner table when there are much better tables open and it's not even busy. I'll always ask them to seat us in the middle section up-front now, which is sometimes received with a snarky comment but other times, no comment. I've been opting to get things to-go more often now for this reason.",

He admitted his was Americanized as well but you can't complain if something tastes good right?  His mom was with us and she got the tilapia dish. It looked really healthy and smelled really good. Fresh veggie mix as the side with some rice and shrimp on top of the fish.  Overall I think this place was good. We had a gift card here so that was our excuse for going there. I don't know if we would ever go again since we don't live in the area but I am not ruling it out.",

The only disappointment that I had was the child's nachos my son got. It was nothing more than hard shell taco shells with cheese melted on them. I had higher hopes when he ordered the nachos for meat and veggies on real chips, but he was not disappointed :). The service was outstanding. We hope to be back!",

    "text": "Went with a party of five and had extremely slow kitchen service.  Apparently they were recovering from a very busy rush, but it still took us well over 45 minutes to get our food after ordering.   By the time the food arrived we'd gone through six buckets of chips and salsa.   The server did bring us some guacamole for our trouble and she was very pleasant, but that didn't make up for the slow kitchen.   We finally got our food and one of our guests had fish tacos and the flour tortillas were literally stuck to the plate and couldn't even be scraped off with a fork or knife.   Apparently they'd been sitting in the window for 20 minutes attaching themselves to the plate under heat lamps.     The server was very apologetic and brought us some fresh fish tacos and even took off 30% of our bill for all the time we had to wait, but I can't give four stars to a Mexican joint that can't pop off a dinner for a table in over 30 minutes.  It's Mexican food.  Just scoop the meat into the shell and ladle on some sauce and send it out!",

Their food is amazing, and more times that not the service is fine. I have had instances where I have to remind a server to be more attentive and have only had to send food back once or twice. I highly recommend their pork tenderloin- be careful, its spicy. Their papas are rich and wonderful, and their fajitas are pretty decent. I do not care for their seafood, but I do enjoy their poblano stuffed chicken breasts. Their shredded beef enchiladas are wonderful.   I do notice reviews where people simply do not like Abuelo's food- and that's ok, to each his own, it is CERTAINLY a different taste that 99% of well established chains and  mom-and-pop restaurants nationwide. I, personally base all mexican food off of this restaurant, and nothing else really measures up. This restaurant is in a league of its own.   I hope you have a good experience with quality-- PLEASE tell a manager if you dont- these chains really want to give you a wonderful experience, but they cant get better unless you tell them of downfalls. Most often when I have complained and explained my loyalty over the years and what I have come to expect, I will usually be given a new order or a free meal.",

    "text": "The Good - Our server, Emily, was very sweet and fairly attentive considering how many tables she had on a Sunday night.  Their chips and salsa were fantastic.  Their green salsa is out of this world.  It's a really good thing I really liked the chips and salsa and was able to chow down, because dinner...  The Bad - Two things One - I ran into something at Abuelo's that I've run into at a Chili's and I've learned a couple other chains are starting to do...Applebee's is the one I recall a friend mentioning.  There was a digital screen on our table!  At my Chili's experience, I learned that one thing they do with these screens is make available the specialty menus - vegetarian, gluten-free, vegan, kosher, etc.  Ok, fine.  I didn't ask Emily to pull up a veggie menu on the screen because, frankly, I wanted nothing to do with it!  The first thing we did was put our screen face down on the table.  It was impossible not to see the screens on other tables as they flashed through quizzes, games, information about the restaurant's history, etc.  I can only guess that Abuelo's is trying to get families to all interact with the screen so people all don't all pull out their cell phones while waiting for their food to come out...I HOPE that's their goal, anyway.  The presence of these things just depressed and sickened me.  Do Americans really need this sort of stimulation?  What has happened to the art of dinner conversation and coming together to talk about our days?  Abuelo's, why are you adding in more digitainment to distract those of us actively trying to - for example - teach our children that dinner-time is a time to put AWAY the electronics in order to enjoy one another's company?  Ugh!  Yuck!  Why?  Two - As a vegetarian, I'm used to ending up with black beans and some other rice substituted for the usual rice.  I'm not used to the beans being so salty they can't be eaten.  I also think they would have been better trying for maybe a little salad instead of their \"specialty cilantro rice\".  It was literally white rice cooked with cilantro and I think that was IT.  No seasonings to speak of.  Bland, bland, bland!  I got the avocado and the spinach enchiladas per the server's suggestion.  They were in some sort of crepe wrapping and tasty enough, but honestly...for the price it seemed like they should have doubled the number of enchiladas.  It really wasn't much food once you factor in the rice and beans I couldn't get myself to eat.  (I brought them home to have someone else taste test just to make sure I wasn't being too picky...sorry Abuelo's...it wasn't me!)  Abuelo's was a HUGE disappointment.  Thankfully, I had great company?  Truly, I can see the potential of this place.  It could have fantastic.  They claim to be old-fashioned Mexican food and the presence of lard in the refried beans and the use of chicken stock in the rice backs that claim up!  They've got a HUGE menu.  I think that if a bit more thought were put into vegetarian options and those darn screens went away, my review of this place would improve dramatically.  The whole feel of the place would be different!  Last note about those screens - apparently they can be used to pay for one's bill.  As someone who's lived in Silicon Valley and hung out with many, many, a computer expert...when it comes time to pay your bill, please RUN from these wireless terminals.  Keep your credit card info safe.  Have the restaurant run your card the old-fashioned way!",

    "text": "In a word, \"Ew!\"  My honey and I, in a moment of Mexican food desperation, stopped by Abuelo's because we've heard good things.   People lie.  The chips were thin, which I normally like, but they were so thin they couldn't support the salsa. The salsa left much to be desired. While flavorful, the taste was surprising. And not in a good way. (Kind of like when you order a CokeTM in the drive-thru and end up with Dr. PepperTM instead.)  The margaritas were deceivingly generous. I filled my glass three times, but the alcohol content was very low. Were it not for the calories, I could have had five or six of them and still cleared a breathalyzer.  As for the actual meal, I don't know where to begin. I have had better Mexican food frozen from a box than I was served at Abuelos. The sauce tasted heavy of preservatives and more like something you'd get from a can. The pork and the beef on both of our dishes was chewy, and too, more like something you'd get from a can. Honestly, the whole meal was just ick.  The only possible redeeming aspect of the meal could have been dessert, but, alas, they don't serve your traditional Mexican desserts. Fried ice cream is not to be found anywhere on the menu. Of course, fried ice cream doesn't come in a can, so.. there ya have it.  I would avoid this restaurant. If you're in the mood for Mexican and are in the area, see some of my other reviews.",

Comes with rice beans guac n sour creme. This is my favorite thing to eat here. I' ve had their enchiladas here before and they are not that good. The chimis have green peppers inside which is magnificent.  I also ordered the hot salsa which i poured over the chimis and bam.  Was awesome!! This sauce is made with habaneros which is great but very spicy. The service by Chip was great as usual. This is the the second time we have been served by Chip and he is definitely one of the best servers at Abuelos.   I only had one negative on our dining experience; my favorite thing about Abuelos was their cold beer in the ice frosted Margarita glasses, however today my beer was served in regular glasses. The beer was not cold, so I was disappointed.  I still left Chip a generous tip, and he told me they did not have these glasses,...what  a disappointment. Still give them 5 stars for meal n service but 4 stars for the beer failure. Overall 4.5 stars for this place.",

I guess this is a nice place for a special dinner, thus the higher price tag.   Service was great - the server was helpful.   The trio of salsa and chips was fresh and yummy!  I got the chicken fajitas and mmmm - good stuff!",

    "text": "Tonight we had a five star experience at Abeulo's. From start to finish we had a great dinner. This may not be a five star restaurant for everyone but for me this hits the spot and tonight the service and food were both top notch.  Our waitress Amy was wonderful and very engaging. She made sure that we had everything that we needed and was wonderful throughout. One of the food runners, Ryan definitely deservers a call out for his outstanding customer service. I hope that the managers of Abuelo's check these reviews because Ryan is really a great guy and he deservers recognition. He always remembers my fiance and I and he always makes good conversation. He makes sure that we have everything we need and it is people like Ryan who make us want to continue coming back to Abuelo's again and again.  Every once in awhile the service is not as good and every once in awhile there is a mix up with the food but it has always been corrected and I understand that sometimes these things happen. But most times Abuelo's is great and keeps us coming back for more. The chips and salsa are wonderful, the selection of multiple prices of appetizers is great (I recommend the green chili cheese crisp) and the enchiladas are also very tasty.  Overall assessment is that this location of Abuelo's keeps us coming back again and again and that is the True test of a great restaurant, chain or not.",

    "text": "I have such mixed feelings about this place. I haven't been here in a few years and decided it would be a great place to celebrate my birthday.  The cons: my son has a couple of food allergies but a grilled piece of chicken is a standard and reasonable item he usually has when we go out. I requested that and alerted my waiter to his food allergies. A manager came by and I was told that most of their meat comes pre-marinated and they didn't have the ingredient lists to be able to tell me what was in any of the marinades. Nor could they tell me what the ingredients were in items like the tortillas and was told that was because the day guys unpacked them all and threw out the boxes that listed all the ingredients. I get food allergies are a pain, so I wasn't concerned too much about what their allergy friendly foods were, it just sounded shady that they had no ingredient lists for any items I asked for. That should be a pretty standard thing they have in their office. They offered a bowl of fruit for him, of which he was fine with. Our waiter was also missing in action for long stretches of time. Despite turning 29 that day, I'm actually more like 80 and ate dinner at 5 and there was barely anyone in the restaurant. We waited a good 15 minutes between being seated before we received any drinks and barely saw him.   The pro: Despite their weird pre made items with mysterious ingredients, the food was great. I actually quite enjoyed it. However, I probably won't be returning here. It was just a really weird experience.",

    "text": "Just had dinner here tonight to celebrate my mother in laws 70th birthday, being that is was a big night we called ahead made reservations which I appreciated that they accepted but let me say the service and food are definitely the reason they are receiving my 3 star rating today. We had a very friendly waiter but unfortunately you could see because he had our large party of 7 to attend and another table of 12 or more he could've used a few more hands. Our drink order took a smidge longer than it should have but we can deal with that, as far as the food goes.. tonight they ran out of the warmers to keep the tortillas hot, which seems unusual being you have a full kitchen in back? Not only that I ordered the cilantro lime rice as my side with meal and not just once but twice did they bring it to me almost completely cold or semi warm a 30 sec microwave bake. It was so disgusting that I couldn't bare to even ask for it a third time to be correct. The waiter did have the manager come over after he had already informed her the 1st time that the rice was cold but the 2nd time she just gave the fake is there a different side option I can offer you I feel she was the worst at the customer service at least the waiter genuinely cared when they brought the food out cold twice. She couldn't care less. It's unfortunate you had a staff member going to his supervisor for help and back up on a super busy night for something going wrong in the kitchen and she as the manager handled it wrong, I see this as poor upper management and sometimes the managers need to be evaluated under pressure situations because it's unfair when the waiter does try to correct the situation but your superior does nothing to help you.",

My steak inside my chimichanga was delicious (this is also a negative, read further for details). Negatives: so, my best friend is Mexican so I know what really fantastic Mexican food tastes like and I'm sorry to say but this place doesn't have it. I ate more chips and salsa than I did of my own food. The Chile con queso tasted like Kraft American cheese slices melted and poured over my chimichanga, no joke, even gave some to my husband to make sure it wasn't just me. Husband's beef and cheese chimichanga had next to no meat, he basically had fried bread, which being native, I could've made him at home.  The beans tasted... burnt, which we all know is a very distinct taste. And for a very unexpected turn: we asked what the dessert options were, he listed them and I got excited when he said, \"margarita pie\", like what?? MARGARITA PIE?!? YES!!! Came out, yeah, it's keylime pie. That's it. Sadness.",

The chicken can be a bit dry. I like the bbq shrimp minus the bbq sauce as I think it has an off taste.   It was a great decision to bring back endless guac refills for the fajitas.  But, don't be a jerk and abuse that offer!  For me. The fajitas are the best. I'm not all that into Tex Mex otherwise. And, make no mistake, Abuelo's is straight up Tex Mex. Don't come here if you are expecting a different style cuisine like Sonoran or Baja California or Oaxaca.   Nice Yelp offer, too.  Don't know what happened to my review of this location a couple years back. Still very happy.   Good quantity. Fair pricing. Friendly staff. Clean.",

When we travel back to the states wee always come with a wish list that includes things we need to buy and places where we want to eat.  Abuelo's became one of my favorites in the short time that I lived in Chandler. We had the opportunity to stop in for dinner on our last night on our way to the airport, and I was very happy for the opportunity. Abuelo's is ALWAYS on the list.   Stopping in on a Friday night and expecting that to work with a tight schedule might have been a mistake since the couple in front of us was told that it would be an approximately 45-minute wait. I immediately walked over to the bar and found two chairs where we promptly ordered. Our bartender/waitress was awesome and had drinks and food out in no time.   We enjoyed one of the best meals of the entire trip at Abuelo's, and it will be on my list again for the next visit to Arizona.",

The place is decorated with wall arts and artificial plants around. We didn't see much crowd for a Saturday lunch and were seated in a minute.   As we sat, we were given freshly made tortilla chips and salsa. The chips were thin and crispy, salsa was ok for my taste. They have a wide menu option and we ordered jalapeno cheese fritters for appetizers. It was more of cheese fritters, there was very slight hint of jalapeno. We further ordered tilapia tacos, firecracker shrimp tacos and vegetarian fajitas. One can chose flour or corn tacos.  The tacos was served with cilantro rice and beans. The rice was one of the best I have had, wasn't impressed with the bean though. Full points for the tacos, right amount of shrimp, veggies and pieces of mango. I loved how it was not filled with lettuce, which made it easier to eat. The fajita qty is a lot for one person with rice and beans along. The taste was alright but not as good as the tacos.  We finished our meal with caramel flan, the showstopper. The flan was rich, creamy and moist. Loved every bit of it. The price is average and would recommend this place for any Mexican food lover.",

    "text": "3.5. It's okay and I'm willing to try other items in the menu. Ordered Shrimp wrapped in Bacon Fajita. It was kind of disappointing for the price of 18.99. Sure price of shrimp went up this year, but still, for almost 20 bucks this dish is mediocre. Then, tasted \"The Monterrey\" for around 16-17 bucks I believe, I chose it cos it looked delish in the picture. Again, it was just okay but better than the Shrimp Fajita. Also ordered their Mucho Margarita, and that one was spot on. Will probably go here next time for happy hour and see what they offer. Service was borderline rude. I was with my parents that time, so I assumed I might whip up my ID just in case, and the server said \" I dont need the ID, it's okay\". Then I asked jokingly \"why do I not look you ng anymore?!\" (im 24 lol) and she said \"no not anymore\" with a couple of hahas. Gee, thankssss. But yeah anyway, minus that little situation, ambiance is pretty with fake coconut trees and cloud ceiling. Oh and btw, that skinny girl that's hostessing, don't put her there, she looked annoyed as hell on her job, not a very good start for the customers. But yeah, still Aok. Would go back for the drinks more so.",

Chips and salsa are one of my favorite parts of going out to a Mexican place, and theirs are forgettable.  You'll get good service here and the place is fancier if that's what you are looking for, but there are dozens of local establishments in the valley that'll serve you more authentic food.  Albeit, they just might be a little more ghettoish but still can make a heck of a taco.",

I've never had an avocado enchilada before.  I mixed up the other enchiladas with pork and beef with various sauces on top. The beans and rice were good and reminded me of what I'm used to in certain place ins California.   My wife had steak/shrimp fajitas. She enjoyed her meal. The only complain was the small amount of cheese, sour cream, etc that comes with the plate.  The steak was juice and tender and the shrimp was cooked nicely.  Our food came out quickly, as we ordered and hot.  The server was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fattentive.to&s=28bd3d598e234e348d6704b272ddef660315f69f9c76bd3bef9cc31fa3665461\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">attentive.to</a> our need, refills and also returned the check in a timely manner   Was this the best mexican fare I've had, no, but I definitely think the food is above average.

Overall, I was happy with the meal and experience and will be back again.",

    "text": "Took a guest to Abuelo's for dinner. I was very embarrassed. First off, the atmosphere was nice. Very unique! Our service was great but there was not a lot of people there. The chips were good but the salsa tasted like they squirted Macayo's taco sauce into a bowl and called it fresh!( My guest came up with this comparison!)    My guest had a steak fajita chimi plate that came with rice and beans. The presentation was gorgeous! The cheese sauce on top tasted like the canned Nacho cheese sauce you might get at a state fair. In fact...my guest said that was all he could taste! The refried beans were very bland. No lard for sure! The rice resembled a Chinese fried rice which was just weird!  He hated it so much that he didn't eat much.   I had the steak Fajita's which were supposed to be marinated.(NOT)! It was over cooked(some spots were even burnt and crunchy) fatty cheap steak. My guess, Flank or Skirt steak! The veggies under it were not Mexican! They consisted of broccoli, zucchini, yellow squash, a few peppers and a lot of onions. It was served with a bowl of pinto beans. They were soupy and tasted like liquid smoke! I didn't eat much of my dinner either!   I have traveled many places and dined in many exquisite establishments. This in no way resembled Mexican or Spanish cuisine in any way.  Just gross and VERY over priced!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fspoonfulpersuasion.blogspot.com%2F&s=d1d7a006fbe06d13c850c77eb17a3454f71dea6a7c3a9c5f96725690535dfd2d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">spoonfulpersuasion.blogs...</a>",

The food on this recent visit was tasty but the service was at best confusing.   We were taken care of by 4 different people, our server who took the order and brought drinks (started out can I get you something to drink?, which sort of makes me crazy, offer me something specific or tell me your favorite), another that brought our food and I love this, this means they care about getting food out while still hot, so thank you! In the end we were brought our check by another server and when I handed back the bill to him it took a little while to finally get it back...from yet another server. I understand team work but usually it comes along with a little communication. Where did our first server go? No mention if he went on break or dropped into an abyss.  I have never seen a manager in this restaurant, at least that I can remember. I happen to like when the manager stops by and says hi and asks how the staff is doing on our visit.  I am sure I will be back because the ladies of the house are fans and I wont have to go kicking and screaming because food is usually good, I just will not expect to be \"wow\"ed by the staff.",

We started off with the Dip Sampler which was yummy & hot! The chips were endless and the waitress happily accommodated our requests for a spicier salsa. My friends ordered the Avocado enchiladas and the beef enchiladas with a crunchy chicken taco on the side. Both couldn't stop raving about the fresh ingredients and authentic taste. I ordered the Shrimp Yucatan Fajitas. They came out sizzling and were delicious!   The waitress was so friendly and helpful, the layout of the restaurant was authentic and kind of gave us a feel of the Venetian in Vegas with the high domed ceiling. I will definitely go back to Abuelos!",

But I can tell you that I go there on a weekly basis to get my avocado enchiladas, papas and beans. Plus the chips and salsa are to die for. If you like hot ask the waiter or waitress to bring you the inferno sauce, it is the best but only available upon request. I have tried many other items on the menu and they are all awesome. My husband's favorite is the stuffed chicken medallions but he is always trying new specials and they never disappoint. If you have not tried Abuelo's you are missing out on some incredible food.",

We politely said hello and asked for a booth, she looked at us like we were from Mars, and didn't say a word.  Whispered something to another girl, who sat us, without a word.  The only reason this restaurant is getting 1 star, is because of the delicious cheesecake dessert and cup of coffee, awesome! Also, the ambiance is fantastic, fabulous idea with the cloud ceiling.  Our server, Brittany, was rude, impatient, short, and the least bit helpful.  The only reason I know her name is because I heard her greet another table next to ours.  She didn't check on us more than once, the very polite busser lady took better care of us!    The food was NOT traditional, completely chainy, heavy, and full of oil.  I guess i'm just spoiled with good Mexican food from where I live...  The salsa tasted, (and looked), like tomato paste.  The chips were light and delicious though.    Basically, there is a reason the other Abuelo's have closed.",

    "text": "Wow, what a difference a talk made. After I had posted here I had also commented on Abuelo's Website. I was contacted by the Assistant General Manager via E-mail a few days later. She asked if we could talk by phone. So I gave her my phone number and she called me the next day.  She apologized sincerely about the terrible service and food we received and said she would send me 4 VIP Vouchers for free meals. Her name is Jennifer Dils and she followed through on her promise.  So we went back on Friday, April 3rd, 2015. We were promptly seated and it wasn't until our server, his name is Will, came to our table to ask for our drink order that I gave him the free meal cards and asked for Mrs. Dils. She came to our table shortly and introduced herself. Mrs. Dils was extremely professional and courteous and it was truly a pleasure meeting her. Will, even before meeting Mrs. Dils, was very nice and quick and throughout our entire visit was very attentive, without disturbing our little party.  We had brought my Son along and again, my parents.  My Father and I had opted for the Chicken Fajitas, The Chicken was juicy, well seasoned, the Onions and Bells underneath it nice and translucent. My Mom had the Fajita Burito with the Chicken and Chili Con Queso on top. She really enjoyed her meal. The only thing was that she ordered all Rice and received Rice and Beans. But that was not such a big deal.  My Husband and Son both had the Ribeye & Enchilada and chose the Cheese Enchilada. They asked for the Ribeye to be medium rare and it may have been just a tad more rare, but they both loved it. We had the Guacamole and Chili Con Queso for the appetizer. Both were delicious, loved the Guacamole the most. We had it on our last visit and again, we were not disapointed.  The Salsa this visit around, was very good, it was not runny like it was on our previous visit. The only thing I don't care for is the Green Salsa. It is a little to sweet for my taste, buy my Dad liked it.   Overall, this was the Abuelos I remember and we will definitely return again. I hope the excellent service and food will become the norm again and want to thank the Assistant Manager Mrs. Dils once more for addressing our complaint and making sure that all was well. She even came at the end of our meal to check on us.   Thank you Abuelo's for what turned out to be a great return visit.",

I was starving (what else is new?) on a Friday night so I dragged my boyfriend out for some Mexican fare.  Let's start at the door: the hostess didn't look too excited to greet or seat us.  Our server took our drink order, we received our trusty chips and salsa, and got to work.    The menu was pretty standard for an \"upscale\" Mexican restaurant, seafood selection and all.  After the server described \"The Monterrey\" plate as one you could fit a turkey on, I was convinced.  This hefty entree consists of four different types of enchiladas, a chile cheese relleno, chicken taco, and guac... how could we possibly go wrong?  The plate arrived ginormous, as promised; I just wasn't particularly impressed by any of it.  As much as I love food, I am a quality over quantity kind of girl, and this entree was not cuttin' it.  I honestly can't point out anything in particular that I did not like about the plate, it just wasn't memorable, finger lickin' good, or (please insert cliche here).    When dessert was offered, we politely declined.  Our waiter dropped the check fleetingly and muttered a \"Thank You\" or something of that sort as he zipped past our table.  I do give the place props on decor, as the paintings, statues, and lighting throughout the restaurant are impressive and reminiscent of the culture of Mexico.",

I was super disappointed last night when ordering the vegetable fajitas to find out you use butter to grill your vegetables and you put milk in your tortillas.  The waitress, who was super at her job, was only able to offer me a salad.  She said there wasn't any vegetable based oil in the kitchen to grill my vegetables.  Super frustrated for myself but the rest of the party really loved their non vegan choices and they will definitely be back.  Me, not so much.",

The food is always on point and delicious and I love the atmosphere in Abuelo's. I met my party here so I can't comment on how long it took for us to get our table but I will say that it took several minutes for us to get greeted by our server. However, once she got to us, it was mostly smooth sailing from there.  I think one of the things I love the most about Abuelo's is how extensive the menu is - there's bound to be something for everyone! For me, their enchiladas are what I go for immediately. I don't like red enchilada sauce (cardinal sin to some, I'm sure) so I love that they have not only  a green sauce, but a few others that I can put on top of my enchiladas. Personally, my favorite is their sour cream sauce. Seriously so good! I also had their swirled margarita, which is a traditional margarita with a sangria swirl. Whoever thought of this needs a medal, because it was amazing!  Overall, I really enjoy Abuelo's but I think that the attentiveness of their servers could improve.",

They also come with a cilantro lime rice that is nothing short of amazing. The first time we went here McKenzie was our server and she was awesome. She knew the menu, knew what a vegan was, and provided us with prompt, efficient service. The second time I went here the server (don't remember his name) was just ok.

My boyfriend and myself decided to give Abuelo's a try today. He got a gift card from his work so we figured might as well give it a shot. I'll be honest, I wasn't excited because I've been craving pizza all day (being 7 months pregnant all I crave is pizza), so I wasn't all excited. It's the day before Christmas Eve and it was packed. Right when we walked in a hostess greeted us, and sat us at a nice little table. We were given nice warm chips, and salsa. And our waiter greeted us and got our drinks, first of all. The spicy salsa is wonderful, the green salsa is even better! I opted for a raspberry lemonade and it was so refreshing. We ordered some of the jalapeno cheese fritters and when I say they are amazing, oh I mean it. Right after we took the last bite of the cheese fritters our food was brought out. I was amazed because of how busy it was I figured it would be another 10 minutes till we got our food. The food was soul warming. We ordered off of the lunch menu and I got a chili relleno stuffed with cheese and a cheese enchilada with beans and rice and it was so flavorful. My boyfriend got the chicken chimichanga with beans and their papas con chile, he's usually a bit picky with his food. But he cleaned that whole plate off. We agreed we will definitely be back, but only for a special occasion because it is a bit pricey.",

They also offer drinks which I opted for the margarita but they literally have a full bar so you can have anything you want... The place is very beautiful so you can sit outside, inside, or at the bar. The prices are a lil bit high, dinner for 2 was around 60-80$ average plate of food is 20$ and drinks about 8$.

In that time we have visited several times and each time has surpassed our expectations. Start with food as usual, we have tried several dishes and appetizers. Our favorites are the carnitas enchiladas and the firecracker shrimp tacos.  The servings are plentiful, the ingredients fresh and the flavors delicious. Overall the food is very good.  Next in importance to us is service. We have been there at the busiest times, Like Friday nights and during slower times like weekday afternoons.  Every time the service has been excellent very little wait and lots of attention.  The restaurant itself is spacious, open and very nicely decorated.  All in all, we have always enjoyed our visits to Abuelos and will continue to go there.  We must also say that none of this was a surprise to us once we learned who the proprietor was.  We both knew Chris when he was very young and starting in the food business. The food business has always been Chris, passion and that continues to be evident in his establishments.",

Almost to the point of wondering if he was okay to work. We ordered our food and I had to repeat my order as did my hubby both thinking hmmm that doesn't happen here? Before our food arrived we had devoured all of the salsa (which is very good) and asked for more upon our food arriving, well this is where they're losing a fourth star waiter never came back.... several minutes later almost at the end of our meal, he refilled my tea and I said um can we get that salsa we asked for? Without even so much as a sorry for failing to bring it out during our meal he just has a busser drop by with it. We don't speak to our waiter again he just runs by with our bill and keeps moving. Just plain inattentive service and over all the place needs updated.Sometimes the hostesses an be snotty too but they're 18-20 yo so what can you expect. Still giving 3 stars for the food.",

    "text": "\"Meh. I've experience better\" definitely captures it.  Nothing especially 'wrong' but nothing right either.    The chips are paper thin.  The fajitas aren't really seasoned and come with tons of onions and not enough peppers.  Tiny plate of toppings.  On the bright side my friend and I recently split an order of these bland fajitas with extra chicken, which was plenty of food and just a few bucks more for the extra chicken.    We've been here before, so on our way out we were kind of looking around for the yummy buttermints that are normally sitting out in a bowl.  Upon request, we were each given a handful from a huge box hidden behind the host stand.   Why weren't they out - the hostesses didn't want to share??    The courtyard feel to the restaurant is nice but the food isn't worth it.  And the happy hour ends at six o' clock; lame.",

On the positive side, at least they have several decent vegetarian options. On the negative side, all of those options are loaded with greasy cheese and have very little seasoning. The sangria tastes like fruit juice - ick.  Yet another disappointing Mexican restaurant in Phoenix - then again, I should have known better. It is a huge, corporatized chain outside a shopping mall...",

I've never had to send back food or have ever felt like it was just \"okay.\" It's always hot and they use great quality meat and fish. If you've never been, I would recommend trying their enchiladas which you can basically create the way you like, and their papas fritas(mashed potatoes with a Mexican twist) so good! On top of great food, they have great service and the restaurant/bar and bathrooms are always clean!",

I ordered (and still do) the kid's bean/cheese burrito - very inexpensive and yummy.  The thing I like is that the beans have a peppery taste to them so it's not bland.   The one thing that keeps me coming back is the chips and salsa.   It's not unusual for me and my lunch buddies to go through 2 bowls of chips and 2 bowls of salsa EACH before we even give our order to the waiter/waitress. I think they put something in it to make you crave it.   For the price and atmosphere - I can only comment on my kids menu choice ($6) and the lunch crowd (not too busy).",

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because their nachos were not enough for 2 people, they had to refill our basket twice since we were munching on them like they were the last snack on earth. As soon as we walked into this place I felt I was eating at an upscale museum, the decor is simply beautiful and refreshing and I even told my friend I feel I am not in Arizona, feels like we are somewhere in Mexico. I ordered their lemon salmon with veggies and rice, again food is very flavorful but to me the rice was too small not enough, the salmon was a good portion but rice and veggies to me didn't fill the plate cause I wanted more. I would definitely come back with friends and try something new on the menu or maybe order the same salmon again since I wanted more, it was very tasty with the lemon butter on top. The waitress was sweet and helpful, our order didn't take too longer to come to our table. I was a  happy customer.",

When we left there were two of the hostesses at the entrance, neither of them said a word as we walked out the door!. Service was a little spotty, and the waiter could have been more attentive, and simply put the check on the table without asking if we wanted desert, which we did! The food was better then average, good flavors! But could have come to the table a little hoter then what it was. Management really needs to do some in house training on the staff!",

I give this place 5 stars.....  I know it's a chain but I think the food is tasty...the ambience is really very nice too. Relatively speaking its cheap too. I think their chips and salsa are pretty good. I usually judge Mexican restaurants based on their chili rellenos they have two kinds one filled with cheese and the other shredded beef...both are delicious.   They have the standard rice and beans that most Mexican restaurants serve with everything...but they have an option called \"papas con chili\" ...imagine a cheesy mashed potato casserole...I don't think Mexican when I request it with the rice because I'm not a big fan of beans....but I still think it tastes good.  I recommend this place if your looking for a good bite! I've probably been here a total of 15 times or so...and have never had a poor experience.",

Really, unless it's completely disgusting, it's all the same to me.  Tortillas, rice, beans, cheese.  By food alone none of my Mexican reviews would vary more than 1/2 a star up or down.  Again, when I go to Mexico, now that's a different, very yummy story. So I'm going to judge the restaurant.  It's actually cute.  It has a large, covered, internal patio.  Which unfortunately is always full, I gotta aks if they take reservations.  But the ambience is nice, and the staff is friendly.  I disagree with other posters that it's expensive...it's average, and really, you get huge portions.  Ok, so they have large portions at Filiberto's too, but here you pay for the service and the ambiance.  So I didn't think it was that pricey.  I also like that it can accommodate large parties...restaurants like these are always hard to find.  Where do you take the grandparents, greatgrandparents, grandchildren, parents....?  here.  I don't think it's the place for hip people to hang out, or maybe not great for a romantic date, but it is perfect to bring your grandparents on your birthday, or your dad on father's day.  Every place has its purpose.",

From the Sangria and Margarita we drank (stiff, the way we like em) which were made really well, to the entree's and deserts, everything was super tasty. They start you with chips with 3 different salsas, then we got 2 drinks, 2 house specialties, 2 deserts. We kinda splurged cause we haven't eaten out for a while, the bill was just over $70 which is more then we normally spend but the food was so good we both agreed it was worth it. Next time we will get 1 appetizer, 1 entree and 1 desert to keep it cheaper. The portions are big enough we could split that and be happy. Will probably still get a couple drinks too cause they make em good. The house specialty sea bass plate was outstanding.   Oh yeah and the place is really nice inside. Comfortable.",

I was given \"new\" rice 3 times and still the same results. Very disappointed. I was then offered Mexican rice and politely accepted it, but that was spicy and not good to me.   One of the Brisket Taco's was soggy and totally fell apart when I barely grabbed it to eat. I politely asked for a side of corn tortillas so I could remake my taco that fell apart. By time the the new corn tortilla arrived the brisket was cold on the taco that fell apart and the new tortillas were as hard as frisbees  The restaurant remade my brisket tacos which was amazing, but still with the wait, hard crunchy tortillas and still not having rice  and the restaurant not at least comping something it wasn't a pleasant experience.",

We were greeted by the friendly hosts at the front - that impressed me right off the bat.  Oh dear lawd.  My sister was right.  We got the dipping sampler - the guac was to die for.  The white cheese dip made my tail wag too.    I got the white sauce chicken enchilada and was stunned by the serving size. It could feed a family of four.  Or one very hungry Theresa if she was wearing her fat stretchy pants.  Thankfully, I had the sense to get a box and get half of it off my place lest I leave with a food baby.  All this to say - when hubby and I are in the valley again, this will be my destination for lunch.  (The dinner prices are a bit on the steep side for my budget.)    Give 'em a try!  PS  My sister had a coupon for a free appetizer so the total bill was around $20.  You could spend that much at a crummy fast food place!",

The server even recognized that my daughter was probably vegan when she ordered vegetarian fajitas without sour cream or cheese, so he brought corn tortillas instead of flour b/c the flour tortillas use milk ingredients.  He also explained it to her so she would know to watch for it in the future.  Great atmosphere, great food and great service, wholeheartedly recommend Abuelo's for a family dinner!",

I knew better than to make my long awaited return, to go explore a chain restaurant, but my parents recommended Abuelo's.   Nothing was bad, but everything was average. Guacamole had flavor, but texture was like it came straight out of a gallon tin can. I had the chile relleno plate.  Enjoyed the shredded beef relleno, but did not finish my plate.   I will seek out family run Mexican food joints.  I think Abuelo's will primarily be popular because of 3 words: location, location, location.",

I hate it when they over exaggerate the Mexican theme. Abuelos does it right with a courtyard feel ambiance.   The food is amazing. They have one of the best beef fajitas I have ever tasted. They also have various flavors of enchiladas that are very good.  Depending on time of day, you will experience a wait time to get a table which means there will be a wait time for your food. Don't worry, they provide chips and salsa and they are good. The food is definitely worth the wait.",

The ambiance is great, the service is attentive, but the food is just OK.  They have a Tex-Mex menu and that is a plus, but again, the food is just OK.  Last night I had steak fajitas.  The meat had a good flavor but was was dry and the peppers and onions were barely cooked and completly unseasoned.  Some of the onion was still raw.  No salt on any of it.  They have a really good spinach casserole side and I love the lettuce leaves with the fajitas.  I wanted them to get better, but they haven't.  After this many visits, and no real change to the food, I have to assume medicrity is the norm.  Last night was probably the last vsit.",

I buy those myself so I know what it tastes like. Nothing tasted fresh, my shrimp were rubbery, fajitas were mostly onions and bland. Nothing was worth going back for. Plus it was wayyy too expensive. It was like you were paying for the scenery, and not the food. At Valle Luna right now and they're salsa taste so much better.",

It took me 1.5 hours to polish off due to its size and brain freeze side effect.  Huge fan of their green salsa! Sweet (like a hint of mango?) and mild.  Ordered the beef chimichanga - not the best...I guess I assumed it would be shredded beef when it was ground! It tasted elementary and cafeteria-like. But - the papas con chili?!? Soooo tasty!  A friend split the Fajitas-for-two with another friend. With their order, they received a plate of lettuce, onion, cheese. One politely asked if they could get a little more. The waiter acts like lettuce is rare and sacred and tells her \"Well, lemme see what I can do\". What??? Dude, make that happen - we're talking lettuce and tomato here!! Smh  No add'l fixings were provided. That's just not providing a positive customer experience, IMO.  I won't be back for a full meal, but wld entertain just having their papas and a margarita at the bar.",

He also laughed along at my dad's jokes and was very quick witted. Cool guy!   The food was delicious. The fajitas were served piping hot and my parents said they were amazing.

Placed my order, the waitress departed, so figured it was an easy solution to ask them to \"lightly fry\" the shredded beef burro...they must have the ability since other entrees are \"lightly fried\".  Couldn't help but see the manager coming towards our table as she seemed quite on a mission.  It was no surprise, as she braced herself against the back of my seat in the booth, and quipped....\"I understand you can't find what you want on our menu\".   Harsh...very harsh.   I explained what I wanted.  She said they couldn't do it.  Appalled at the Manager-with-an-attitude who is definitely in the wrong job....rude, abrupt.  I had no other choice as she towered over waiting for me to make a selection, to order the ground beef and cheese burrito which was lightly fried.  When my dinner arrived at the table, it was a pathetic 4\" by 4\" heavily fried 1/2\" thick (flat) something with MAYBE two tablespoons of ground beef in it.  Don't go there....too many other places nearby that offer quality, choices, pleasant staff, and value.",

    "text": "While visiting the area from Cali, my friend was told about this place by some women who work at Nordies. So, we decided to try it out as we were both hungry for Mexican food. Ate here on a Friday night, waited about 10 minutes to be seated and had ordered off the gluten free menu shortly after. I choose the three ground beef tacos on soft corn torts. Most gluten free torts aren't soft, so I questioned that before ordering. Also, I wanted to substitute the meat for carne asada as I am not a fan of ground beef but the waiter said that they put MSG in their carne asada. Yuck, I thought and decided to stick with ground beef. They were okay, nothing special. They do have yummy green mild salsa though, which was better than my entire dinner. Service was great. I haven't heard that a Mexican restaurant uses MSG in their food before though. My friend order their chicken and steak fajitas, she said it was okay. I wondered though if her meat had MSG too. Eek!!",

On our weekday lunchtime visit we were seated quickly,  our chips and salsa arrived within two minutes, and our server appeared just a moment behind.  Initially my daughter declined appetizers so we could actually eat our lunch, but I couldn't resist - ordering Spring Rolls from the tapas section and a Shrimp Cocktail from the \"regular\" appetizer list.  The Spring Rolls were \"eh,\" (and I wouldn't order them again) but the Shrimp Cocktail was amazing and actually the most tasteful item of those ordered.  It consisted of at least a dozen shrimp, and was served in a huge margarita glass with pita chips on the side.  It was definitely a sharable amount for four people, but the two of us ate it all and were then too full for our \"real\" lunch.  Within 5 minutes of presenting our volcano hot entrees, our server returned asking if we'd like a box for leftovers.  Two full plates came home.  Reheated Mexican food is never good but we made an attempt for dinner...yuck.  Although this is hard to admit, next time I'll do as my daughter says and just order lunch sans appetizers (Daughter = 1 / Mom = 0).  The food looked good, and on our next visit, we'll eat it.",

I recommend the Pescado Guerrero - a wood-grilled tender mahi-mahi steak with fresh shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, spinach, roasted peppers and sliced avocado in a white wine sauce. Yes, I totally stole that description from their website, although I did remove the word 'delicious', since I'd already used it in the previous sentence. Thought it might sound a little too repetitive if I left it in, two deliciouses so close together. Not that this dish doesn't deserve 'em both, it's just that I'm not one to repeat things unnecessarily. Omit needless words, that's what Strunk & White would say. Sharp guys. Not big Yelpers, from what I understand, but still good advice nevertheless... Although, used correctly, repetition can be an excellent rhetorical strategy for producing emphasis, clarity, amplification, even emotional effect. I guess Joe Walsh was right, there are two side to every story.  Oh, and I'd stay away from the Fundido del Mar appetizer. A little too much fondue and not enough shrimp & scallops.",

First time I tried the tortilla soup which was authentic and really tasty.  The next time, I tried my test for all Mexican restaurants,,,,chile rellenos.  The rellenos are some of the best I have ever tried and you can fill them with cheese or tender shredded beef.  The beef is outstanding and I did one of each but next time will probably do all beef it is so good.  Both times we have also had very friendly service. Definitely going to go back because I have to try their margarita ((another of my tests for Mexican restaurants))-I will let u know how good they are) and they have a tres leches cake that I am dying to try also!!!!!!!!",

We sat in the bar for dinner and Spike was our server. It was like pulling teeth to get a drink menu and he was so inattentive and unfriendly, it was completely uncomfortable. We couldn't wait to leave and even mentioned that to each other when our food was brought out.  I'm glad we had a gift card and didn't spend any of our money, the experience was less than a pleasure.",

They have a huge menu, and, not being familiar with their food, decided to play it safe with a chicken burro (also, it was less expensive). What I was brought at first looked akin to a huge, flat fish on a platter -took me a bit to realize it was a burrito. It was literally just a flat, super (or should I say souper) saucy burrito with a splash of lettuce on the side. It seriously lacked flavor, and wasn't worth the price. I'm sure some of the fancier things may be good, but I wouldn't eat here again unless I had to.",

I think their version of that dish is pretty good. Most of their plates fit the Phoenix Mexican restaurant MO: rice and refried beans with an entree that is fried and/or covered in cheese and chilli sauce.  The decor at Abuelo's for some reason reminds me of a Vegas casino. A little over the top. Kind of cheesey but still fun and nice it its own way. Service has always been good. If I remember right they have a decent bar, too.  This is not on my regular rotation but I am willing to go here if someone else invites me.  For more authentic Mexican you can try Espo's down the street but you will not get the same level of service or ambiance.",

My parents are in love with Abeulos because they're from Connecticut and when they think Mexican food, they think enchiladas as it's all they know.  The place is pricey for what you get.  $15-20 for a couple mediocre, small enchiladas.  I won't ever be going here on my own.  When I go with them I order the cheapest thing on the menu.    Of note is something strange.  Abuelos has three salsas that come with chips when you sit down.  One is ok, and the other two are terrible.  They are very, very bad.  Here in Arizona, I can find the best salsas I have ever had.  But not at Abuelos.  Just everywhere else.  One is green and very sweet.  It must have a lot of sugar in it because no fruit is that sweet.  Weird.",

Our server, though I can't remember her name, was very pleasant.  The food, left a little to be desired, but it wasn't bad by any means.  The beans were dry, but they can get a pass, they're beans...  The stuffed chile was an odd mix of chewy and mush.  So I wasn't a fan of it.  The rest of the food, was good; not great, but good.  I'll agree with other reviewers that call it pricey.  For the food being offered, it is on the pricier side.    Overall the place is good to visit once in a while.",

I personally don't care what a restaurant looks like, it's the food that makes me a repeat customer.   Let's start with the service, it was great and the staff was incredibly attentive. After I received my food I felt really bad that they had to work in this sham of a restaurant; they can't even enjoy a good lunch at their own work. I wish them all the best and think they were the only highlight of our visit.  The food. It's not Mexican food. It's tortillas, rice, and beans, but not Mexican food. My boyfriend corrected me and said it was Tex-Mex, but I can't imagine this can be Tex-Mex either. I ordered the Tilapia Veracruz and the fish came with a tomato sauce. I swear, they just opened a can of El Pato sauce, smeared some on and called it a day. The cilantro rice was hard like it had been sitting out for a while or sat too long under a heat lamp. The vegetable medley was lightly seasoned with butter. Those veggies were probably the only decent thing on my plate. Thank god for the chips and salsa, they truly made the experience bearable. I suppose if they messed up chips and salsa, they would be in serious trouble. There are so many more restaurants in the valley that can run laps around this place and take pride in what they serve their customers. Go there, not here. Just keep driving. Give that hole in the wall a try.",

We had 4 adults and a kid. After waiting about 45 minutes, we still hadn't gotten our food. We noticed it had died down a lot and shouldn't have taken our food that long. We spoke to the super nice manager, Jessica, and she told us there is no way our food should have been that long and comped our meal. The food wasn't awful, but it seemed as though it was put under a heat lamp and forgotten about for a bit. After we spoke to the manager, the waiter seemed super upset and was not as friendly. He gave us all the stank eye, even after we tipped him. Hopefully this was an isolated incident. Loved the atmosphere and decor, though. Hopefully my next visit will be better.",

They were ok,  but the 'guacamole' that came with them was nothing more than a really tiny teaspoon of mashed up avocado with no spices.   The queso is a joke, it tastes just like velveeta with rotel in it.  Was not authentic or good.  Chipotle queso is actually better.  For 8 bucks it was a serious disappointment and in a pretty shallow bowl.   My son got the chicken nuggets which were inedible.  Super over fried and so hard i couldn't even cut them with a knife. Seemed like maybe they were prepared ahead of time then frozen and refried or microwaved.  But by the time they cooled off enough for me to realize they were terrible it was too late to ask for more.  So my son only ate fries which were also very greasy.   The chips were good but the salsa was very plain and runny and in tiny little containers so you couldn't even get much on the chip.  The service was decent and he was nice but waiter didn't check up on us very often.   We used a coupon and still paid 40 bucks for basic disappointing food.  I'd rather have gone to chipotle or cafe rio and spent half that.",

Seriously, the negative reviews are ridiculous. Abuelo's menu is something I call \"upscale Mexican\" for lack of a better moniker. Their food is always fresh, excellent and nicely presented. If it isn't spicy enough for your taste, they have four salsas to put on it (ask your waiter for the habanero salsa, they don't routinely bring it out), their portions are generous and their prices are very reasonable. I've never had a bad food or service experience in any Abuelo's in the country. The restaurants are all outfitted similarly, and they're beautiful inside. Booths are roomy, and there is a nicely elegant \"feel\" to the dacor. This is an excellent place to take a date, or dine out for an occasion. If you're interested in great food, tasty desserts, large portions and fair prices, ignore the \"this person just can't be pleased\" negative reviews and eat here. You'll be glad you did.",

The chips are thin, fresh and crispy.  I love how they give you a selection of three salsas too.  My son had the tortilla soup for a starter and said it was excellent.  I enjoyed my fajitas and liked how they put the delicious beans and rice in separate bowls.  Our server was very sweet and conscientious too and brought everything to us in a timely manner.  I am looking at my receipt right now and it says her name is Yazmine.   Next time we are in town we look forward to our visit here.  Too bad there are no locations in California!",

    "text": "Prologue: My fiancee and I decided to celebrate Mexican Independence Day with our first visit to our nearby Abuelo's.  The Plot: We started by sharing the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms and Seared Tuna appetizers.  That was followed by The Monterey, which consisted of a Sour Cream Chicken Enchilada, Avocado Enchilada, Spinach Enchilada, Chicken Ranchera Enchilada, Cheese Chile Relleno, and a Crispy Chicken Taco. We also ordered one of their September specials called The Hidalgo, which consisted of a Fajita Frite Relleno and Fajita Enchilada with Cilantro Lime Rice and Black Beans substituted for Mexican Rice and Refried Beans, respectively.  We concluded our meal by happily sharing a Chocolate Eruption.  The Scene: We arrived at approximately 6pm on a busy and popular Saturday yet were seated within 15 minutes, which, in our experience, was quicker than average for a large franchise.  The chips with assorted salsa along with our beverages arrived soon thereafter.  The appetizers were the next pleasant surprise and both were enough for the two of us to share. I was quite satisfied with the Seared Tuna despite it being somewhat more pricy compared to the other appetizers on the menu. We're both devoted fans of sushi and sashimi and the quality of the tuna, both in flavor and texture, was obviously better than we've experienced at most Asian restaurants. The mango relish, avocado, spicy mustard, and honey lime dressing complimented the fish very nicely. The Stuffed Mushrooms were topped with a cheese sauce that was light and had a nice tomato flavor that went well with the spinach.  The Monterey was a generous quantity of food for the price and would have been enough for the both of us on its own. This was my first time trying a Spinach Enchilada and Avocado Enchilada and both were very good. I am also a Chile Relleno fan and I truly enjoyed the fresh, veggie flavor of the one that was served with assortment.  My fiancee thoroughly enjoyed her Relleno as well, which on the Hidalgo plate was stuffed with beef, and the Fajita Enchilada was stuffed with chicken. Both were flavorful, well seasoned, and she commented favorably on the delicate texture of the corn tortilla. She was also very satisfied with the Cilantro Lime Rice and Black Beans, which nicely dressed up this plate more than the Mexican Rice and Refried Beans probably would have.  The Chocolate Eruption was a slight variation on the familiar molten chocolate cake or chocolate lava cake with which we've all been tempted before. We both liked this version very much because the hot chocolate sauce was poured on top rather than baked inside so the whole the cake was soft and moist. There was also enough ice cream and whipped cream for both of us to share. As restaurant franchises go, this was perhaps the best dessert experience we've had thus far this year.  The Rest of the Story: The service was prompt and courteous and the prices very reasonable for this type of dining.  This was our first experience using Ziosk and I hope many more of our favorite restaurants will begin to implement this system. Be sure to tap the \"Call Server\" button when you're ready to order.  Epilogue: We felt the quality of the food and the overall dining experienced deserved 3 stars and decided to upgrade our rating to 4 stars based on the good service, reasonable prices, and the chocolate dessert.  No doubt we will return the next time we're in the mood for Mexican.  Photo Design: by Billie Z.",

    "text": "Met a large group of friends for lunch on a Friday. The restaurant is very pretty inside and I was impressed with the fact that they already had the table set with salsa and waters out. The server was great considering we had a large party of 20. She was extremely attentive, so the service was very good.  I ordered the Red wine Sangria which for $8.00 wasn't that great, it was overly sweet and lots of ice, so watered down very quickly. I would have gotten a better value, I think, if I just ordered a glass of wine. I ordered the lunch special Fajita Tacos w/ rice and beans. I asked for Steak, but unfortunately got chicken instead. So, I suppose the service wasn't that great since they messed up my order. Unfortunately, due to the large group I didn't want to tell them the order was wrong, as I can only imagine how much longer I would have had to wait for my food. The wait for food was over an hour, again, I know a large group, but geez! The did get everyone's food out at the same time though, which was impressive. The chicken was overly salty and had a weird rubbery texture, which, to me means that it was either cooked ahead and microwaved to be reheated or it was overly processed chicken. It kind of tasted like a fast food \"grilled\" chicken just chopped up. Not pleasant. My beans had a \"skin\" on them. Ordered a kids quesadilla and fries which had processed cheese on it (I can tell). She wouldn't eat it because she knew it tasted funny. With one drink, a lunch, and a kids meal..my bill was $35!! For lunch?! The kids meal alone was $6.50 for a processed cheese quesadilla and greasy fries. The price point is just crazy for lunch and quality of food was disappointing. Salsa was no good either. Sorry I just don't have a lot of positive things to say.",

I ordered the Shrimp enchilada but asked to substitute beans and papas for my sides.  The serving was not very big but it was very satisfying.  I could have eaten twice as much.  My friend picked two enchiladas but I don't think she was crazy about them.  The chips were thin and great.  I had the Tres Leches cake for desert.  So powerfully rich and a very large slice.  We were seated in a side booth but my friend pointed out the beautiful painted sky in the center of the building.  I will definitely take my family and probably order the same thing but with an appetizer to fill up all the corners of my tummy.",

I think they spent more time decorating the place like it was a Greek Orgy room than focusing in on either the food or the service.   I ordered enchiladas that came out gloppy and tasteless. My companion ordered vegetable fajitas where the grilled vegetables were either soggy, burned, or quite possibly both. Despite it being a quiet time there (3pm), the server appeared rarely as they seemed to be overreliant on their new table touch screens rather than actually paying attention to their customers.  Quoting another reviewer, this place is very \"cold and corporate\" Considering the plethora or choices in Mexican places in Chandler, I'd suggest almost anywhere else, including taco stands that charge 1/4 as much.",

    "text": "Expensive, poor quality, poor value, good service!  Let's start with the manager confirming that the food will never match the pictures.....so whatever you do don't go by the pictures lol!  They have tons on their marketing so wonder where they bought those pictures!  Let's follow that up by the pure and simple fact that you will not overeat here!  Everything they serve seems to be a lunch portion or even go as far as to say snack portion.  Example:  Fajita's: $18.29 (add tax and tip -let's call it an even $25, you get unlimited tortillas) - Chicken was about 7-8 slices/edges. It was well done and stuck to bottom, it ended as shredded chicken and tasted a touch jerky-like.  Frozen chicken typically will not cook well so accept that fact and it came out in less than 10 minutes so it was sitting around. - onions, plenty, but mostly - partial burn on most. - green peppers - read reviews.  Manager confirmed that for this meal 3 small slices is the max. Red peppers - nope don't trust the picture hahaha!  Manager did say you can order with extra veg. - side condiments; like ever other review - sparse but enough for 1-2 (kids sized hand tortillas). - tortillas (corn or flour) x3 But you get unlimited Incase your an onion fanatic.....they were extremely fresh and good.   - beans, just not our thing so no review. - rice, the usual dryness but edible. - asked for lemon on side so nice!  Chips and salsa were pretty good.  Just order a side of what you like as there isn't much but it's free so no complaints there!  All in all okay, may try again and double the order!",

He really did go above and beyond to try to make it right , but my whole family was not overly impressed.  I would like to add that the hostesses at the front were pretty rude, luckily we had the waiter we did or this would have been   Update to my review:  My stars now go down to 2. Reason being is you ask me to come back and let management know so they can make sure it's right , but I never ONCE had a manager come by to ask...... it all starts with leadership people.   Again your hostesses don't say Hello / Goodbye and this is just how the establishment is run I take it. They are complaining as I leave about shifts / breaks ! SMH !  It's sad that you get a heads up to make it right, but don't take advantage of it.",

    "text": "I was very surprised by the atmosphere, which is rather wonderful.  Fajitas are my go-to at Mexican restaurants. And that's what I ordered.  I got the requisite chips and dip. One green salsa and two red salsas In too-small quantities was served. I only tasted one of them, and it was very good. I assume the other two were too hot for my taste. The chips were very light and crispy and warm. Delicious.  The steak fajitas came out, and the steak and onions were fine, though they needed salt. Seemed to have very few green peppers. The condiments were served, as is always the case, in too-small quantities. They did say that they would get me more condiments or tortillas if I liked. One tiny little wedge of lime was provided. I did ask for more lime, salsa, and pico.  The Mexican rice was boring - - it needed salt. The beans were very good, though they were more southwest barbecue than Mexican.  The price is more than I have paid for Mexican food in quite some time. However, the atmosphere is almost worth it. The presentation was also nice. But nothing extraordinary.  As for the service, I was hopeful because my server seemed very friendly. However, my fajitas were delivered by someone else, and my server all but disappeared for quite some time. I believe he was more interested in the tables that had more diners-- I was dining alone. I love to tip a lot for great service. And I usually get it. However, this time I can't say I did. The server--Christopher--had all the right words, but not the right actions. Sorry, his tip will be mediocre.",

    "text": "I've been waiting to try this place out for some time. It's so beautiful on the outside and today I had the perfect chance hanging with the bestie.  The vibe and atmosphere are just AMAZING! I really felt transported to another place. My stars are for ambiance mostly. I'd give it 5 stars for ambience alone. However, I'm rating the whole experience.  We were seated quickly and at first site the dishes on my table were dirty . Not a good start. Waiter replaced it immediately.  I wanted to try as many things as I could eat so I started with a quesadilla, cheese crisp, jalapeno cheese bites and a small side of their fresh made guacamole.  All were delicious with the exception of the quesadilla which was a simple quesadilla no  added stuff. My FAVORITE was those jalapeno bites YUMMY!!! The guacamole was good but not salted. I found that to be a trend.  I received my plate which looked beautifully plated. The plate was super hot took soooo long to get cool enough to begin eating and it dried out the food.  I ordered the stuffed chicken medallions. This came as like a sliced up chicken Kiev style portion. I was not happy with this at all. Was gross and didn't taste like chorizo at all. In addition I'm not sure if the chicken was marinated too long but it was chewy and left bad taste in mouth I couldn't even eat it. Even the bestie tried and had to spot it out.  I tried the beans and they were dried out I'm not sure if this was from the hot plate or kitchen warmer or just bad choice. Flavor wasn't good either I couldn't eat it.   The other side dish was like a loaded mashed potato and those were ok but extremely hot and again no flavor or salt. In the center was a cheese sauce which tasted good but I had literally nothing to eat it with so essentially I paid $13.50 for a lunch dish I didn't eat.   We were on a time crunch at this point and decided to eat the rest of the cheese crisp with guacamole to fill up.   Service was good, average, nothing over the top and the waiter was ignoring others trying to flag him down which really bothered me. I will say my biggest disappointment was that when cleaning the table and getting us our check the waiter didn't even ask how our food was or why I didn't eat the full plate of food.  I know that sounds petty but let's be real this is literally the first time I've ever been out that the food server hasn't asked about the food out the experience and especially after viewing a full plate of food.  Lastly I did have to use the restroom and was quite excited as this upscale restaurant would for sure have some upscale facilities. I was highly disappointed again. It was filthy and that was just the last straw for me to be honest. I won't return.  I'm super sad I had this bad experience as I do love the vibe and feel of the place and the decorating is that of the Venetian in Vegas but better. I guess I had such high hopes that the food would be out of this world amazing. The menus look to die for.... I fo wish I had tried the enchiladas as friends said that's what they go for.   At this point I'll pass!!!",

Now to bad we ordered guacamole it was way to expensive for avocado with no flavor  The food left alot to be desired, the restaurant caters to the area, in my opinion it was not authentic Mexican food, I was not impressed. My meal was lukewarm but the plate itself was hot not sure how that is even possible. I had the two enchiladas and a tamale it really didn't have a lot of flavor. I don't think we will be back.",

    "text": "I hate to give this place three stars. The fact is if your looking for a cantina Mexican restaurant that is nice this is the only option around. The other cantinas don't have good food. When this place is on it's awesome. The food is not always good. I have a real issue with that due to the fact it's slightly on the pricey side. Last night I ordered chile relleno. One was great the second was not great. My date ordered the spinach cheese thing as one of her sides which was cold. By the time it was remade she had finished eating. The server was really nice she apologized and explained it takes four minutes to remake but come on don't send that out cold.   Thinking about it today I feel like I should have gotten a amanger involved and demanded them to comp at least one of my rellenos and one side dish.   I'm being honest here by the time I got to the car my stomach started to turn. So if management reads their reviews I suggest you do an audit of the sanitation going on in your kitchen.  Sure it's possible it could have been something else I ate some other place but I'm going to put my money on the fact that I'm not the only one. I normally have a cast iron stomach.  Again it's a shame because it's a really nice restaurant and if you want to get Mexican in a nice place it's the only option. Places like macayos have terrible food. Valle Luna is another place that I have always had horrible food.",

I called ahead just to check the wait and were told they still had some tables and since we don't live that far away, we came right down. Once we got here, it was far busier than they let on. Admittedly, and despite that, we did get seated right away... and that's where it went downhill.  We know that the food is always great and tonight's choices of enchiladas were no exception; however, the waiting to even be recognized by our wait person was ridiculously long. It took nearly 10 minutes for the chip guy to come around. When he did, we had already made up our minds about what we wanted to eat and had our menus closed and laying on the table. Did that matter? Nope.   We waited at least another 10 minutes (no exaggerating here) before the wait person came. The crazy part? We were practically seated right next to the stand where they all gather. We were passed by no fewer 10 times by a host of people and not a single on acknowledged us. I sat here, arms crossed and menus down, growing ever more impatient with the staff. When the woman finally came over to take our order, she offered no apologies for the delays. At least she got our drinks right away and took our order. I guess I should feel good about that. She was nice enough for the remainder of our meal.  There are no shortage of other quality Mexican places around offering the same fare. I guess the next time we consider coming here, I'll have to REALLY want it. That isn't likely to be enough to get our business but I suppose we'll see.",

My friend asked if they could make her a bean & cheese chimichanga which is not on the menu, and we figured easy enough to do, but I guess not because our server said it couldn't be done. She got a meat chimi that she wasn't to excited about.   I ordered my usual that I used to get a few years ago the ground beef enchiladas. The flavor was okay, but not at all what I remembered. The papas were a fave of mine, but today they were bland. The refried beans were so dry. I hardly ate any of my meal it was so disappointing.   The decor in this place is beautiful, but not worth coming back.",

They bring out generous (complimentary) portions of their chips and 3 sauces to start off with - the green sauce is delicious - it has a slight sweetness to it from the pineapple juice. House margaritas are a must here. We ordered the guac appetizer - it is THE creamiest and freshest guac I've ever tasted. The cheesy enclidas were good as well but I'm not a fan of corn tortillas to begin with so besides that, everything exceeded expectations!",

When we got their we 1st ordered the Abuelos dip sampler, which had a cheese dip, a bean dip and their avocado cream, which was like a guacamole whipped with air, not my fav, but everyone loved the bean & cheese dip. Also ordered a pineapple infused maragarita, man that was delish!!  I ordered the Nogales, which was beef & chicken rolled into a flour tortilla enchilada style, that my friend was a perfect dish!! Others ordered the Sonora, Tilapia Veracruz, beef and cheese enchilada combo! All the dishes were perfect and delish!! The heat was there I was a happy camper!! Love the spicy food!!!   Look forward to coming back and trying other items on the menu!  Oh by the way the daughter that wanted tamales, never ordered them, she went with the enchiladas LOL",

    "text": "We started with chimis and jalapeno cheese bites as appetizers. The dipping sauce for the chimis was sweet and tangy, a pleasant surprise. The jalapeno cheese bites were not spicy, and were closer to hush puppy consistency than I expected.  We ordered an enchilada sampler and shared it. It included 4 enchiladas (spinach, cheese, avocado, and a meat), a chile relleno, beans, mashed potatoes, and a dollop of guacamole. The meat and spinach were my favorites, but the other two were also good. The beans were thick and hard. Next time, I'll get the rice.  Although it was good, and definitely enough to share, I think I'll stick to their seafood. On another visit, I had the Tilapia Vera Cruz, which was delicious and unique.  Most meals are a bit high (about $18 - $24). The seafood is worth it though.   The decor is pretty. It reminds me of the casual opulence of the Paris casino in Vegas.  By the way, CostCo members can buy $100 worth of gift cards for Abuelo's for $79.99. The server didn't have any problems accepting it.  - - - - - - Added comments In response to the manager's question: I may have tried your margaritas in the past; but it's been too long ago to remember. During our last visit, my boyfriend enjoyed his beer, although I don't remember the brand.",

The food we ordered came out in a very timely manner, another positive mark in my book, especially being a former F&B guy myself.  We ordered Fajitas for two, beef and chicken combo, and they were very good.  The sides Christina suggested were top notch as well, especially the spinach!

We felt like we were eating in the \"Cheesecake Factory\" of Mexican restaurants.  -The decor is reminiscent of Ceaser's Palace in Vegas.  Very grand and somewhat over the top.  -We ordered skinny margaritas.  They arrived quickly and were not skinny and we could tell they use a jigger to measure the tequila. We could not drink these as they were too sugary.  We ordered a second round and voiced our disappointment to the waiter.  The second round was the same as the first minus the limes.  -I ordered the two chicken enchilada combination. One with green sauce and one with red sauce. I asked the waiter if the sauces were the same that came with the chips and salsas.  He said yes and I indicated which red and green salas I preferred. He said no problem. My dinner arrived shortly and unfortunately, both were covered in red sauce. The red sauce was nothing like the salas.    Overall, the place is very mainstream and geared towards the masses.

My wife and I will usually order the \"skinny\" margaritas which have less sweetness than the regular margaritas. I have tried multiple entrees and have never been disappointed. I especially like the tilapia. Service is usually quick, even on busy nights. Food is of good quality, prepared well, and nicely plated.

O.K., we got refills on our drinks without having to ask for them which was nice and just before we were leaving he brought me a to-go drink. But at the end of our meals he took forever to bring to-go boxes, spilled lemonade on my foot and took a plate away without asking if we were done with it. C wanted a steak burrito with cheese, that's all. Our server recommended something that had ground beef in it. I told him no, he wanted grilled steak. Not ground or shredded beef. He suggested the Fajita Chimichanga with steak. So that's what C ordered, with the Chile con Queso, sour cream and guacamole on the side. $14.79. He also got beans and rice which he didn't want. He also didn't want the Anaheim Pepper that was inside the Chimi. When we inquired if the kitchen could make the Chimi without the pepper we were told that the kitchen doesn't \"make\" the Chimi's, the just heat them up. The Chimi's are already made so the pepper couldn't be removed. SERIOUSLY!!!. For $14.79 they are serving pre-made Chimichangas. I can get a made to order burrito at Chipotle for half that. I couldn't believe it. Is the age of actual human cooks working in a restaurant a thing of the past? Is it just conveyor belts, microwaves and monkey's back there? I'm appalled. C's grandma ordered the Monterey. Sour cream chicken enchilada, avocado enchilada, spinach enchilada, chicken ranchero enchilada, cheese chile relleno, crispy chicken taco and quacamole. $17.59. She made a few requests, like putting the guacamole on the side and everything was done to her satisfaction. K ordered the Grande. Three enchiladas - one beef, one cheese and one sour cream chicken. A cheese chile relleno, tamale, crispy beef taco and quacamole. $17.59. The crispy beef taco was a crispy shredded chicken taco. Plus K ordered the pinto beans but go refried beans. Not only can't the kitchen make a chimi, they can't read a ticket either.  I ordered the Classic Chicken Fajitas. $13.99. The Fajita skillet was warm, but definitely NOT sizzling as it is described on the menu. The plate comes with sliced grilled chicken, onions, red and green peppers. There were still seeds on the red pepper. So they can't make a Chimi OR prep a bell pepper. Wow. I also got 3 nice sized flour tortillas and a side plate full of condiments like pico de Gallo, shredded cheese, sour cream, guacamole, lime wedge, rice and crappy lettuce with a couple of radish discs. There was a good amount of chicken, but it was a bit dry and not very flavorful. I think Chili's across the street does better Chicken Fajitas. The busser kept the chips and salsas coming which was nice. They now serve the salsa's in a cute little 3 compartment dish. We went through 4 refills of the salsa's. Although we didn't use it. Abuelo's has the Ziosk. Neat little machine that sits on the table allowing you to order drinks, dessert and/or play a limited amount of games. It also lets you sign up for their email club. I've signed up twice but have never gotten any email from them with a membership number or coupon. K signed up this time so we'll see if anything shows up. Something to note though. The games cost $1.99 which is a dollar more than over at Chili's.  Server off his game, prices to high, pre-made food. 1 Star.",

    "text": "If I had to choose between Garcia's, Macayo's, La Parilla Suiza (here in Phoenix) and Abuelo's... I'd choose Abuelo's before all the other places. Why? Simply because for a chain establishment, the food offered is quite good, and the prices comparable.   I tend to go for the seafood choices of Abuelo's I've had the Pescado Guerrero and the Enchiladas de Cozumel. Both entrees are good, the Pescado Guerrero is a mahi-mahi steak with fresh shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, spinach, roasted peppers and sliced avocado in a delicious white wine sauce. It's delicious, the mahi-mahi isn't fishy at all, and the accompaniment of the roasted peppers with the sliced avocado balances the dish. As for the Enchiladas de Cozumel, it is crepes filled with fresh guacamole, covered in a rich white wine sauce with a medley of perfectly seasoned shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, fresh spinach and roasted peppers, the dish is similar to the Pescado Guerrero hence why I like both.   Another plus for Abuelo's are its tortilla chips and salsa. The tortilla are so crisp that they're quite addictive, and the salsa is not overtly spicy, and has a thick consistency. Something that I do enjoy. So, if you have a hankering for some Mexican, I suggest you try Abuelo's if there's a location near you, it's worth it and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!",

    "text": "I was born and raised in Texas and moved here 3 years ago.  Mexican food has been my favorite since I was in the egg.   What you people here in Arizona call Mexican food is equivalent to a gas station taco in Texas, no offense, but you know how Mexican food differs from state to state and everyone loves what they're used to... even when it's shameful! I rarely eat Mexican food these days unless it's a burrito, cause you can mess up a burrito... very often.  I don't remember the Abuelo's back home being this delicious, so maybe I'm just homesick, but the first time I ate here, I had to excuse myself to have a cry in the bathroom -- I was so happy.  Tex-Mex has it's own name against the rest of Mexican food for a reason.  The atmosphere here is soft and comfortable, and the service is exceptional.  It is a bit pricy, but the portions are... Shall I say it? Alright, Texas sized and it doesn't taste like it been rolled in dirt and places under a heat lamp for 12 years.  Take it from a Texan, this is Tex-Mex, and if you don't like it, then you're simply partial to your own state's form of Mexican food... which makes me a very sad man. As far as the bar is concerned, my mojito was overpriced and too sweet and my beer was just overpriced but still delicious.",

Pretty much everything on the menu has cream or cheese as an integral part of the dish. Even the tortillas are warmed on skillets covered in butter. So, if you are like me, I would skip this place.  However, if you are like the majority of the population who enjoy dairy products spread all over your food, you will love this place! It's not really Mexican food as much as it is Tex-Mex. Lot's of enchiladas and tacos and burritos. The portions are HUGE...you definitely get a lot of bang for your buck! Everyone at our table (we were a table of 20) was very happy with their meals....The chips and salsa were really good too!! (I usually judge a restaurant such as this by their chips and salsa...) I ended up having a salad with cheese and whatnot removed, and salsa for dressing, as most of the dressings also had dairy in them......  Service was SUPERB! As I mentioned, we had 20 people at our table.....we were seated in less than ten minutes, our water and chips were never dry......and we only had one waiter!! He did SO well! He knew the menu very well too, and was able to help me find something I could eat.   So, 4 stars for service and everyone being happy, and one star docked for there not being more allergen friendly dishes......",

I went on a date and she has been wanting to go here for a long time, and she didn't know I don't like Mexican food because it was our first date. I can find something on any menu to eat, so it was no big deal for me really, I wanted her to be happy (awwww such a nice guy!). We arrived, waited only a few minutes and were seated.  We were greeted promptly by our server, can't recall his name though but he was rather serious in demeanor. He took our drink order and promptly returned with our drinks. My date had a mango Margarita and she loved it. But then it kind of went south a little from there. When he took our food order, I told him I wanted Prime Rib. His reply was \" we don't have that\". Confused, I reached for the menu because I know I saw it, and it was only then he said Prime Rib was only available on Thursdays. This was a Sunday. Ok, kind of 'short' in his response/approach, but let's move on. He took our orders with less enthusiasm than I've seen on a 2 year old's face in a timeout and then he left.  The food came VERY fast and my date loved hers. Mine was good. We were done for quite a while before the server returned. I asked if they had desserts. He responded by pointing at a menu tent on the table and walked away. That was nothing short of rude in my opinion. He was gone for a while but we were able to get our dessert order in and received it promptly, but then proceeded to sit there for a good 15 minutes after we were done before he came to our table with the bill. He visited the table next to us 3 times in that 15 minute period. We decided to sit and chat for a bit after that, again 1st date and it went GREAT by the way :) The server came back to our table and picked up the signed credit card receipt, just asked if it was ready. I said yes. He took it and walked away. No \"thank you\". No \"come back again\", nothing. He had his money and he was gone!  Overall.. good food, decent atmosphere, greeters were friendly but this server was not. Sorry he had a bad day.. but don't drag down your customers. Customer service really seems to be going downhill in general.",

    "text": "We went to your Chandler, AZ yesterday for Fathers Day at about 5:00PM. I called ahead at 3:30 to check best seating times. We arrived just before 5 and were immediately seated. After sitting for a few minutes we noted that it was a very warm in the restaurant. We were brought our drinks in a timely fashion and ordered. It became even more obvious that there was an AC issue at the restaurant and I asked the waiter who stated that they started having AC issues at about Noon. We went ahead and had our meal which I really don't remember eating because we were all suffering from the heat in the restaurant which must have been 100F. Waiter said yeah, sorry... but you should see how hot the kitchen is. Like we really were concerned with the kitchen. By the time we left the restaurant had filled up and we were leaving drenched in sweat.           I asked to see the manager at the front desk before we left and she promptly came out. I advised her that all of her customers were miserable and why had she not been seen for the whole time we were there (little over an hour). She stated that she was working on getting the AC fixed.                    I just wanted to share this and let you know that if I do not receive some kind of positive feedback (which I did not receive at the restaurant) from corporate I will never return or recommend your company again. We've been enjoying your restaurant for over 10 years here. That manager should have been on the floor interfacing with the customers and offering discounts or even refunds. And she definitely should have had the matrode/greeter warning customers at the door (if not closing the doors for new diners).  So what really pissed me off was that I well called well before driving the 30 miles to the restaurant and nobody said a word of warning.  And yes, our son dropped $80 on his first time taking me out for a fathers day meal (with his first pay check), and he felt HE had to apologize to me.   Horrible, horrible, horrible manager.  We typically had very nice meals at Abuelo's.  UPDATE: I was called very quickly by Abuelos today after sending an email and yelping. The restaurant owns their errors in communications and resoution when they had issues yesterday and are trying to make things right with their customers that suffered through the meal yesterday. Though I can't bring myself to go above 3 Stars, I do bump it up to a 3 Star review from a 1 Star review for their rapid response. Thank you for doing the right thing Chris. We will return :-)  Final Update: Chris came through with some credit to dine here again. We returned recently and enjoyed our experience and will probably return in the not too distant future.",

If you want the real thing, go to Guadalupe, or better yet, South Tucson. That said, the food wasn't bad at all, in fact, it was quite good. Frozen margaritas packed a punch, and the place is quite charming, with lots of hanging potted plants and colorful murals. Service was prompt and polite. Whether its totally worthy of being a self-proclaimed embassy of cuisine is in doubt, but Abuelo's is definitely reasonable, given the price.",

    "text": "This is a go-to place for me and my family when I'm in town. The primary reason? Well, the really good quality food, of course. But more than that, this is a place that has quality food for all types of people. My mother is someone who very rarely eats Mexican food because the spice (and really ANY spice at all) is too much for her. I, on the other hand, like things fairly spicy. Others prefer to be sweating heavily into their dishes...so understandably, the wide variety of preference can be hard to cater to. This place has it all, and did I say quality? Quality food here. Just quality...  ...And quantity! Pretty big dishes. Others have complained about the severs but I've never had a problem. Drinks stay full, people are nice and are not hovering over your table constantly. Ive never been spoken to rudely or any of that nonsense, just kind of typical average dinner-going experiences all around.  The decor and atmosphere are quite nice. You really get the feeling you're in some fancy casita owned by some drug lord somewhere in Mexico. Was that racist? Whatever. Its inviting, its a little flashy, it gives your eyes somewhere to wander if your date is boring as sin.  They have their own unique spin on things for a restaurant of this type: ie offering potatoes as an option to rice & beans, monstrous combo plates, etc. I like that because it makes it an experience you're really not going to find elsewhere too easily. Keeps me coming back.  Overall, I highly recommend this place. Yeah its gringo mex fare, but its pretty delicious anyway. Great place to have a beer or five with your meal, and I think you'll be coming back often as well.",

Abuelo's is as close to what I grew up with that I've found in the Valley.  The quintessential Tex-Mex plate is cheese enchiladas with chili gravy, crunchy beef tacos, and tamale with rice and beans.  They hit the mark right-on with the enchilada and taco, but the tamale is so-so.  Chips are outstanding and the salsa is very good.  The place is a little too fancy and the prices are a bit high, but you won't walk away hungry.",

The service was outstanding, of course we came during an off peak dinner time, so maybe there was an excess of waitstaff.  I had a chicken fajita chimichanga, not what I expected. Could have been decent if prepared the correct way. There was one large pepper on top of few cubes of chicken, all wrapped in a doughy tortilla. And, quite honestly, it very well could have been pre-made and reheated upon ordering. It was definitely not fresh tasting. The beans tasted like they were straight from a can and the rice was dry and flavorless. Both remained on my plate. My husband and I split an order of nachos, which we actually laughed at when it was delivered to the table. Not quite what we were expecting. It was five pieces of halved corn tortillas with a sprinkle of meat and melted cheese.   When we order nachos, we expect actual nachos; not floppy melted cheese. My margarita was good, but for $10, I expect more than 3 or 4 sips from my glass. Very chintzy. It was a unanimous vote from our table...we won't be back. Very disappointing.",

The only thing that is odd is the decor and atmosphere inside , it is in need of an update to make it more current but other than that the food is soooooooo good!! Im so happy I found this place it reminds me of being back home in the south. Tex Mex restaurants are hard to come by in Arizona.  It reminds me of El Chico in the southern states but BETTER!!!  My husband had the brisket tacos and he said it was the best he has EVER eaten!!!! He is very picky and hard to please so that says A LOT! My family eats here one to two times a week! It's that GOOD!! Please open a location near Paradise Valley!!! This is a great place for kids because they have game kiosks on the tables. My daughter loves playing on it! Try the cheese and onion enchilada with queso on top,,, it's so good!! Spike and Alonzo the bartenders are the best servers and bartenders!!! The chimichangas are the best! You must try their side of potatoes they taste like twice baked potatoes, delicious!!!",

Maybe the manager does read the yelp review....?  Unlike our last visit, the hostress did sat us on a comfortable booth away from the kitchen without asking. Shortly after chips and salsa was served, the waiter showed up lightening fast and gave us the ice tea that we ordered right away. For appetizer, we ordered small shrimp ceviche for less than $5. Even thought the portion was small, it was a good size to fill me up before our parties arrived. It has a bit too much tomatoes in it which makes it tardy...overall, I still enjoyed it. For my main entree, I ordered fajitas for 1 with all beef (you can choose two different types of meat if you like chicken, shrimps or veggie) and double size of Spanish rice. The meat portion was very generous, but it was a little on the dry side. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it after mixing it with salsa to make up for the dryness.   We told the waiter that it was our friend's birthday. When we were done with our entrees, he gave us a plate of chips with scoops of ice-cream on each one of them. It was quite delicious. After we paid the bills, he still stopped by to give us refill for drinks and did not ignore us like the last waiter did. I'm extremely impressed with the improvement that they've made since my last visit.",

    "text": "We stopped here for lunch and found a big restaurant that's part of a larger regional chain of 40 locations. They actually started in Lubbock, Texas and moved West.      Our server Nina was definitely a Keeper. She has a long tenure at this eatery. The chip and salsa were a bit off. The chips are very thin and came stuck together. The green salsa with pineapple was tasty but the other two red ones didn't get to first base.    The jalapeno cheese puffs were not too special. They were hollow inside with a small amount of jalapeno and a touch of sour cream.     The main event was where they shine; The enchilada plate with an avocado with cream enchilada was lights out. The ground beef with chili was also tasty. The beans and special house mashed potatoes were great.     The chili Relleno was way up there with a tasty poblano pepper and great picadillo. The beef enchilada was a winner as was the beans and house potatoes. The fresh, hot, corn tortillas made a complete dinner.     Having a Pro for our server made this a great experience. I found out that Abuelo's honors our veterans with a nice discount. I asked because I recently found out that one of my favorite restaurants in San Antonio had been doing this for forty years and I just found out about this year.",

A mango sweet green, a spicy red and a mild red. All were very good and the chips were thin, crisp and super fresh. After we were seated it took our waitress about 10 minutes before she came over to greet us and ask us what cocktails we wanted. After we order our beverages and food on 2 occasions she tried taking my plate of food before I was finished eating without asking me and also tried taking my margarita glass that was half full. At least ask first....   The food was great. Order the 2 enchiladas, 1 shredded beef with chili con queso and 1 cheese with chile con carne. The enchiladas were small portions but with the side of espinaca and papas con chile I was stuffed afterwards.   Hope for better service next time.",

I'm going to enjoy a second margarita but only to annoy the bartender when she has to walk from the back of the kitchen to come out to see me again. You have to beg for chips. She's very abrupt. And if you don't know exactly what you want she acts offended and indignant about getting you a menu. This place haa truly horrific service. I actually would give it zero stars if that was an option. Plenty of staff standing around you. All looking busy. But none of them help you at all.  7 employees standing right in front of me tucking it up in Spanish.  They get pissed if you ask for anything.  Am I invisible?  Did I forget to shower?  Must be something I did.  Otherwise this place just SUCKS.",

The chips served after you are seated are accompanied by 3 salsas (green chili citrus, hot verde and \"regular\") and all three are really tasty. They're unlimited but be careful, don't spoil your meal.   If you like beef then try the Durango burrito. My wife always goes for the enchilada trio (chicken, avacado). You get to select from sides like rice, papas (mashed cheese potatoes with chilis), and various beans. The margarita list is solid, and the house ritas are really pretty good. There's a great lunch menu if you're visiting midday.   The staff has mostly been friendly and attentive every time we've visited- the place is good for kids as they have  nice menu for the little ones. The \"main room\" has a skyscape painted on the ceiling, so our toddler enjoyed that room. For the quality of food, I think the price is right- although expect to pay a little more than Macayos or Serranos. It's worth it, go visit!",

    "text": "I certainly cannot weave a tale like Nick.  However we have been coming here for some time so I thought I should write something.    Service  First, never had bad service...never...That's difficult to pull off.  Yes it is a chain, but you really wouldn't know it.    Today, we had an exceptionally great server Emily (don't know if that's how she spells it).  But she answered all of our questions and actually had opinions on what she liked and why.    Food Yes, the food here can be sporadic.  But it is never bad.  It is not always consistent. For example, sometimes you get a lot of chicken in your enchilada and sometimes you have to hunt for it.    Today, as usual we both had enchilada combos.  Don't judge, we like them.  Wife and I tried two new enchiladas.    I had the spinach enchilada.  I will be getting them again...and probably again.  Wife had the avocado enchilada.  We both liked the spinach (yes we shared) and she liked the avocado.  I hated it.  But I hate guacamole so it made sense I wouldn't like it.   Wife also tried the pork enchiladas.  I think she liked them because I never saw one of them.   If you like cheesy mashed potatoes and don't care about calories and fat because you are eating out, then you would be remiss not to enjoy their greatness.    And of course...charro beans please.   Summary We like it here, warm friendly atmosphere.  They wait to make fun of you until you leave when you put a greedy amount of mints located at the front desk in your bag.",

The design and furnishings are consistent with a Mexican restaurant and guests feel as if they are in a more expensive restaurant.  On the negative side, they play terrible music. The architecture and decor are wasted on the type of music they play.  It would be more appropriate to play some kind of Latin music or something that fits better with the theme of a Mexican restaurant.",

Stopped by last Friday for lunch for my wife's birthday.  Lizette was our server . She was GREAT!! Service at Abuelo's is the best in the East Valley and Lizette went the extra mile to make us feel like family. She topped off  our main course with a yummy dessert. We've dined there many, many times at lunch and dinner.  I believe Abuelo's menu has the most choices of True Mexican dishes in Arizona.  I highly recommend Abuelo's by Chandler Fashion Mall on Chandler Blvd.  You won't be disappointed !!",

From the chips & queso with the sweet green salsa to the Talapia Veracruz, the food was very delightful and satisfying. Portion sizes were comparable to its pricing.

So unfortunately, being this is a chain restaurant which I do not ascribe to,  I put Abuelo's on the back burner.  Starting  with the chips and salsa was a real treat.  The chips are very thin, crispy and no grease.  Less calories.  Gotta start somewhere with calorie counting when it comes to Mexican food.  The salsas were awesome.  The green one is the best I ever had.  I could just munch on chips and the green salsa and forget the food.  I asked the server what it comprised of.  To my surprise, it was mixed with fresh pineapple and cilantro. We all ordered an assortment of the usual Mexican fare, enchilladas, chille rellanos, The rice was very tasty as well as mashed potatoes Mexican style which was awesome.  It is called Papas.  Huge portions.  The restaurant itself is a nice setting,  like you are sitting in an outdoor plaza.  I do wish they would come to the Tucson area.",

Beers are also affordable and the happy hour food options are both satisfying and filling.  The happy hour prices are only available in the bar and the seating is somewhat limited, so unless you're willing to wait for those seats or get there right when happy hour starts you might not want to try it.  Service is prompt and helpful and I have been pretty satisfied every time we've been.",

I tried one of the featured margaritas on menu and it was terrible, it did not even resemble the picture. My girlfriend ordered the shredded beef tacos, I could not even look at her plate because it reminded me of canned dog food. She said it tasted like beef stew in a tortilla...and the \"papas\" that came with it were we think mashed potatoes with cheese on top. I ordered a enchilada and a relleno...sauce tasted like taco bell and the relleno was a was bland even covered with salsa and stuffed with processed cheese product...it was a waste of $50!",

    "text": "Someone said they had great Mexican food.  I ordered a chili relleno it came with beans and rice.  Nothing special about it at all.  The cheese was weird.  Usually its a white cheese and this was a sharp cheddar just didnt go well together and tasted odd.  The rice was tasteless like they didnt use spices.  It wasnt even worth eating.  Same went for the beans just bland and yuck.  I didnt feel like telling them but the waitress was really nice and she could tell that I didnt like it and she persisted so I let her know yuck.  She took it off bill which was nice but we wont ever be back again.  This experience happened a few months ago I just forgot to post the review.",

    "text": "I've eaten here many times with my family and the food and service has always been great. It's not receiving my restaurant coveted fifth star because I find the food selection to be on the small side. Also, the desert menu has only two deserts on it and if your not a fan of traditional Mexican desserts your out of luck. I usually order 'The Laredo' which is an enchilada dish with beans and rice it's delicious and while it is a sizable portion it's not overwhelming. The atmosphere here is lovely you aren't talking over anyone and the booths are a bit taller so you have some privacy which is a big plus for me. I hate constantly locking eyes with the person in the next booth when I'm having a conversation or chowing down! Give this place a try, I'm pretty confident you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Such a shame!!!  We have been dining at Abuelos for over 3 years now and the service and food has always been incredible.  My wife and I frequented Abuelos a few years ago for the great happy hour and incredible service by one of the bartenders i believe his name was john.  We would walk in and instantly he would have our drinks and greet us with a smile and small talk.  Unfortunately he's been gone for some time now and since leaving, the bar service is less than average.  We are very low maintenance and simple to please but for some reason it feels like we're a burden on the staff now.  Occasionally we will ask where John went and the guy that worked with him for years will shrug and say he doesn't know but his reaction is always strange.  We used to love Abuelos but now we are simply displeased with the service and the lack of friendly comfort we used to feel.  They should find john and bring him back if they want to succeed!",

Whether it is for lunch or dinner, I am never let down with their food or service! Their lunch menu is affordable and good serving sizes, so you don't feel like you are breaking the bank.  Dinner has so many choices, but I will only name the two I rotate between. I am a huge Chile Rellenos fan, I order them every where I go and I am particular about where to get the good ones. Abuelo's has excellent Chile Rellenos!  The next dish that is probably the best one on the menu and they know it, is their LOS MEJORES DE LA CASA, which is 2 small perfectly cooked bacon wrapped beef tenderloin medallions and 2 shrimp with bacon, cheese and jalapenos, mmmmm so so so Good!!! Good along with all its synonyms in the thesaurus!!!  If you haven't tried it yet, go! What are you waiting for!?!?!?",

    "text": "On my first trip to AZ family brought us to Abuelo's so I am partial because of the memory of good times. There is one in Myrtle Beach we go to when we are in that area as well. Since I was back in AZ had to go to Abuelo's and grab some lunch. Ended up there at the odd time of too late for lunch, too early for dinner so they were not very busy. Our server, wish I remembered his name, was EXCELLENT. He brought us the normal salsa, then offered the habanero salsa.... gave great recommendations on dishes to order and when decided he had great suggestions on how to \"customize\" them. BF had the taco and enchilada plate, beef crunchy taco and chicken enchilada with the spinach cheesy thing and the mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes are excellent, the spinach cheesy thing excellent.. mix the two and it is beyond yum. Beef was well seasoned and chicken nice and tender. I opted for the 2 enchilada plate with one chicken one shredded beef. Server recommended the velveeta cheese on the beef which I opted for but ended up scraping off.. the flavor of the \"cheese\" overwhelmed the beef. The beef was nice and tender, well seasoned and the chicken was the same. I had the cilantro rice and black beans. The black beans were well seasoned and delish, I could have eaten a huuuuuuuuge bowl.",

The meal came with chips and salsa. They literally give you a big white bag FULL of chips and then like a shot glass full of salsa. Like....huh? Ok maybe not a shot glass full. More like two shot glasses. All in all it was pretty good.

    "text": "Abuelos is a solid 3.5 star place, that I'll kindly round up to 4 stars due to the consistency I've experienced with the food and service over the past few years.   Abuelos is one of those chains, that if you didn't specifically tell me I probably wouldn't know it was a chain. They serve a little bit higher end Mexican food... kind of like if Garcia's had a wealthier older brother. The decor is really nice and inviting... complete with the vaulted and painted ceilings, which I'm always a sucker for (I know, I'm easy to please).   The food isn't an A+... it's more like a solid B, but it's a consistent B. There are a couple of dishes that I get on a regular basis. One is the steak & enchiladas, and the other is called \"Mis Abuelos Manjar\". The steak here is suprisingly good for a Mexican place... actually it's one of the more reliable places to go get a good and affordable cut of meat. Mis Abuelos Manjar is basically a couple of enchiladas which are smothered in sauce then topped with two eggs; pretty tasty. Also, I gotta throw a shot out to the roasted salsa they serve; you have to specifically ask for it; it's served warm and it's oh so good.   I've never left Abuelos and thought I'd had the best meal of my life, but every time I go, I leave full and glad I made the choice to go there.   As a sidenote, if you go to this Chandler location, ask for Theresa... she's a fun waitress.   3.5/5.",

The food tasted like it was a frozen meal, and the beans were as if they had been rosarita refried beans just put in the microwave! Not a single item tasted good, and our server seemed as if he was angry or annoyed with us from the minute we sat down. The hostesses didn't greet us, and sat us down without a word. The weirdest part was that they weren't even busy! The place was practically empty for a Saturday afternoon, so there was no excuse for the poor service. My boyfriend and I are always great tippers, but today was the exception and we only left the minimum 15%. The only reason for one star is that the atmosphere is very nice, and it is the only thing that I enjoyed.",
