I love that you get a free crab puff, egg roll, fried rice, and barbeque chicken as an ADDITION to your dinner or lunch entree (because I'm a glutton like that). Everything I've had here is pretty good. I really liked the orange chicken, the egg rolls, the wonton soup, chow mein, beef and broccoli, and the vegetable delight.   I've ordered take-out twice and went to pick up once. Although this spot isn't much for ambiance, the inside is still clean and respectable. It's definitely a good place to check out if you're wanting tremendous amounts of Chinese food for a very low price!",

Free egg roll, cream cheese wanton, and fried rice with every lunch special. The egg roll is wonderful. A few of those alone and you have a meal. The entrees are huge portions with as much white rice as you can eat. Twice Cooked Crispy Pork=amazing. General Tso's Chicken=awesome. Complimentary Egg drop soup=hearty.

And there was no meat and way too much egg for my taste. The fried rice was average, not especially good or bad. The egg roll was good. It was my favorite thing. It had a fresh taste with hints of ginger.   The sweet and sour pork was not good and the main reason for the 2 star review. There was no pineapple in it and not enough green peppers or onions. The worst thing was the thick batter on the pork. So much batter it made it hard to eat. I've had worse, but I was expecting better. At best, it was average strip mall Chinese food. I've had better food from a buffet.",

    "text": "Finally! A high-quality Chinese restaurant in my neck of the woods!  First of all, this is pretty much a TAKE-OUT restaurant. Yes, they have seating, but this restaurant is shabby and dilapidated. I can eat here, but it's just a tad bit eerie. The stars of the restaurant, however, are the two Chinese women who seem to be in charge of the place. One runs front of house, the other the back. The woman who greeted us insisted that we sit at a table as we chose from the takeout menu. She was also a very good saleswoman; suggestive selling appetizers and bottled waters at every turn. I would hire this lady immediately just based upon this.  The woman who works the back runs it like an iron fist. She stands confidently at the pass, and controls the kitchen. Which, by the way, is hot as a blast furnace and I'm shocked that such delicious, gorgeous food can come from such a harsh environment.  Now, on to the food...FIVE STARS!  Crab puffs---delicious, hot, fresh, and the batter was a delicate golden brown.  Pot Stickers---delicious and hot and very generous.  Mongolian Beef---cooked to perfection Orange Spicy Chicken---WHOA! What a combination...citrus and heat. The chicken wasn't pulverized (like they do in so many mediocre restaurants...make the protein unrecognizable), so it was tender and juicy. The sauce started sweet...and then the heat hits you. Bam! Just awesome.  Get your takeout today, folks. (And if you don't mind zero atmosphere, then dine indoors!)",

As everyone seems to have experienced, fast delivery, big portions, great food, etc! If I had to complain about something, I would say the fried rice is different and not my fave, but considering how great the lo mein, general tso's chicken, egg rolls and crab puffs were, that's fine with me.

The other reviews giving this place high praise for \"tasty\" and \"authentic\" Chinese are suspect -  e.g. I too was once a young, naive, poor college student who hadn't a clue what delicious real good inexpensive Chinese food can be.   2 of us ordered General Tso's Chicken and Schezuan Beef combo dinners which came with fried rice, bbq chicken, eggroll, crab puff and egg flower soup. I specifically asked the server if the Sesame Beef was lightly crispy on the outside (which it authentically should be) She said, \"Yes!\" . It wasn't. It was actually served with the meat battered in an awful tasting bad-tempura-like puffy coating as was to our horror the General Tso's Chicken!! Flavorless, eggroll pastry was terrible, the crab puffs pastry and filling was sub par. The egg flower soup was ok as was the fried rice, but just ok.   I've had far better inexpensive diner style delicious Chinese  in San Diego,Ca  &  Boise, Id - this place sucks - run away.",

Next, I noticed the heaping portions, and my delicious twice cooked pork was no exception, out maybe five minutes after my order was taken.    King Wong is not a gourmet restaurant.  It's quite simply the best take out I've had in Phoenix, a city which seems to struggle to provide good Chinese food.  So fire up that Netflix and order yourself a hefty dish of delish from King Wong!",

I always take reviews (good and bad) with a grain of salt, so it was a \"we'll try it and see\" decision for myself and my husband especially considering we've been in Phoenix for 6 years and haven't found a place we like.  The moment we walked in my husband and I were greeted, shown a place to sit and from that point forward we had the best customer service and awesome food.  The sesame chicken was so good, not over or under cooked with just the right amount of sauce.  My husband had teriyaki chicken, something I am generally not a fan of but I tried it and really enjoyed it.  It tasted amazing as well and the chicken was cooked great.  I love egg rolls but I'm really picky about them.  It seems I'm usually getting ones that are over cooked or so limp they're falling apart, these were perfect.    As noted in other reviews it is small but I've been to larger places and felt like I wasted my time and my money.  I also loved the fact that while we were there more than one customer came in and chatted with the staff like old friends.  Obviously this business knows what they are doing with their service and their food.",

    "text": "Came here Sunday night. So this review is based on a dining experience rather than take-out or delivery. As others have said this is a total hole in the wall restaurant. Dining is simplistic, just basic tables and chairs, with a fan blowing in the room to save on air conditioning.  Food was great. I ordered the Thai style chicken curry. It was delicious and smelled better, but I'll admit it was very spicy, a bit too spicy, and they didn't ask how spicy I wanted it, so if you get this entree maybe ask for mild spicy, maybe they'll tone it down a bit. I also ordered crab cakes, not realizing there were 6 in the one order, nor did I realize or anticipate that they'd add a free eggroll and soup with my entree. The dine-in enree was very generous. So I had a bit too much food.  Also, dining in among few strangers there I felt that the staff were extremely conscientious and concerned for my well-being, almost irritatingly so, but I appreciate that they really just wanted to do me good and serve me well. The gentleman (owner??) who assisted the waitress is on the large side (no offense, sir) and as such his presence and moments of interaction were a bit imposing.  Pros:  Great food!  Delicious. Food is why we come! Huge quantity. Very nice and accommodating service.  Opportunities to improve:  Dining environment nothing much to look at. Spicy entree too spicy, should ask for spicy level preference. Slightly too much food. (er, not sure if that's still a pro or not...) Slightly overbearing (but very kind and courteous) attention. Waitress accent slightly difficult to understand.  I will be back.",

I ordered House fried rice, Shrimp fried rice and 2 orders of egg rolls.  The lady who took my order said she was going to give me another order of egg rolls for free because it's Christmas.  How sweet of her to do that!  When I arrived the lady who took my order and another older lady greeted me with big smiles.  Very friendly and inviting.  The restaurant itself is small, but looked clean and quiet.  But, I'll probably only do take outs since it's on my way home from work and convenient.  Anyway, the fried rice was OK.  I had to doctor it up with soy sauce and a tiny bit of sugar (try that on any food to make the flavor come alive!).  Once I did that then it was delicious.  The egg rolls were nice, hot and crunchy.  The filling is just a typical filling which consisted of lots of cabbage.  But, I was fine with that.  So, all in all I like this place.  The flavor of the fried rice could have been better, but it's good enough for me.",

They do a brisk take out business as the phone kept ringing every few minutes.  They had 3 delivery people.   Super nice staff who offered us plenty of free things such as fried wonton skins, egg drop soup, veggie egg rolls.  We ordered the #2 Garlic Chicken and #13.  Szechuan Chicken.  The lady warned us that they were spicy and we told her medium spice.  The food came quickly.  Both dishes looked and tasted basically the same with the exception that one had cabbage in it.  The chicken was slightly over cooked and really did not taste fresh.  I really wanted to like this place based on the reviews.   The restaurant could use a face lift.  It looked tired and old with taped up chairs.  Definitely a hole in the wall.  One of the staff discovered I spoke Cantonese and rattled on.  She hugged both of us as we left and thanked us.  Parking lot available.  Prices are cheap.",

The teriyaki sauce was passable, but the chicken was overcooked and leathery without any flavor. It also looked like I got the worst parts of the chicken when I got a gristly texture.

    "text": "So my review is a little mixed because we have ordered from here many times and it is usually pretty decent. I would say we order take out from here at least once a week for myself and the hubby, we love Chinese food! I have had a few problems and normally they address them, but nothing major.   Yesterday I ordered the kung pao chicken and shrimp and two orders of crab puffs, it was around 20$ with delivery and tip.   Now I open the box and find the contents to be about half empty and slopped over to one side, no problem, probably just moved around while driving, so I fork them back and they lay neatly in the box, now its just like half the box though. Normally the food is packed in there and you see a nice mix of chicken, shrimp and veggies! This time however, all I see is soppy brown liquid, a ton of veggies and 4 pieces of shrimp and about 10 pieces of the tiniest saddest chicken pieces ever! Yes, I actually counted them, that is how sad looking they were! Normally the pieces are about 2-3 inches and look like vibrant delicious food. These looked like 1/2 inch pieces that were left over from someone elses meal.   I called in and was put on the phone with manager, who after listening to my complaint, yelled at the kitchen staff in their own language, came back on the phone and Assured me that the kitchen made it properly, although I was staring at the evidence that they did not. After going back and forth with him and explaining that I have ordered this at least 20 times recently and I am Sure this is not what it is suppose to look like, he says and I quote   \" I serve this many times today and no one complain only you \"  Ok Great buddy, I dont care if you served it a billion times, I did not pay 20$ to eat tiny veggies drenched in a bad sauce with someones left over chicken. So he tells me after arguing that Next time I order he will hook me up with 3 free shrimp, great, but uh what am I suppose to eat tonight for dinner, cause eating what appears to be someones left overs does not look appealing. He says Sorry I cant do anything for you, I wont send someone back.   So basically ... If you're OK with giving them money and NOT getting what you paid for, feel free to order from this place. I hate to give a bad review to a small family joint like this, but seriously if you have the audacity to tell me you Cannot give me something that I paid for because it is not convenient for you, well you officially lost our business.   TL:DR -- Go somewhere else for your Chinese fix, their attitude and food is not worth it. To the \"manager\" have a slice of humble pie my dude, it wouldn't hurt you, your food is not perfect and you can admit to making a mistake instead of alienating your customers over a few pieces of chicken and shrimp and calling them liars. Bad bad service.",

I mean no disrespect to anyone but this place is no where near worthy of that rating.  I live in the area and I have eaten there on purpose twice, and have had friends and neighbors feed me their food a couple more times.  At BEST, I would say the portions are generous for the price.  If that is all that is required to get 4 stars, then so be it!   This food is not good, and that's being kind.  Greasy, gloppy, gristly and nearly all the sauces taste alike.  There's basically three tastes here: salty, sugary salty and savory salty.  Most dishes fit in there somewhere.  I'm a supporter of family-run places, but I can't support this one!  One star for generous portions of basically sub-par food. If that's your gig, I think you'll like King Wong.",

    "text": "I rated them a 1 because I wouldn't order from them again.  My experience was more \"not good\" than \"bad.\"  My order:  Hot and Sour Soup, Chicken Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken, and WonTon Chips; it came with 2 free egg rolls.  Egg Rolls:  I think they used the thickest, toughest leaves of the cabbage for these egg rolls; every bite was like biting into the part of the cabbage leaves that nobody wants.  Chicken Fried Rice:  I tend to measure Chinese restaurants by the quality of this dish and each time I try a new place, it's one of the things I always order.  King Wong had what was probably the worst I have ever eaten.  The chicken was dry and tough and had no flavor....and I don't know how else to say it but it was like it was old.  Kung Pao Chicken:  I think they used the same chicken as in the fried rice, dry, tough, and old.   Aside from that, it was fine.  That's the best thing I can say about it.    WonTon Chips:  I was actually quite tickled to see these on the menu because they're like Chinese crack to me and I rarely see them offered.  And even though I chowed on them like the had crack inside them, I was not oblivious to the fact that about half of them were considerably darker than the rest, suggesting that they had been fried, left out for a long time, and then fried again.  Hot and Sour Soup:  The broth had that \"kick\" that I enjoy when eating this dish.  Not much else to say about it.  I don't want to discourage people from going here; the lady on the phone who took my order was very nice and conscientious and made absolutely certain that she had my order right, and they did deliver the food faster than the 45 minutes they had suggested would be required.  For me, however, the bottom line with a restaurant is the food, and while i really wanted to be happy with it, every bite was a mouthful of disappointment.",

    "text": "Returned to my hotel room after a long day and didn't feel like getting out.  Ordered delivery from King Wong after reading generally good reviews here on Yelp.  I was not disappointed!   First, their online menu is clear and easily understood.  I also like the inclusion of business hours and a list of credit cards accepted.   Delivery was quick with the food arriving in half the time quoted by the person who took my order over the phone.  Everything was packaged neatly, and I'm especially thankful for the plates, forks, and napkins that were included.  It's a huge help for folks in a hotel room.  Also included were soy sauce, sweet/sour sauce, and fortune cookies,   All of the food was piping hot, and portion sizes were quite generous.  I started out with an egg roll which was delicious.  Two egg rolls constitute an order, and they gave me twice that many.  A nice surprise.  I'll save the others for later.   Next it was time for chicken and vegetables.  Again, wonderful.  There was chicken, broccoli, carrots, snow peas, bamboo chutes, water chestnuts, cabbage, celery, and (I believe) cucumbers.  The chicken was in bite-size pieces, and the veggie were sliced appropriately.  There's enough food here to feed three people.  Enough white rice (packaged separately) was included to complements the meal.   I got full before I reached the chicken fried rice.  It looks and smells good, however, so I'm putting that and the 3 leftover egg rolls in the fridge here in the room.   The prices are very reasonable considering what you get.  I paid $18.79 and received 4 egg rolls, chicken with veggies & white rice, chicken fried rice, a Coke, and a bottle of water (thrown in).  Plus all of the condiments and other goodies mentioned above.  There was enough food for three, possibly four people.  I'm sad my wife and daughter were not here to share it with me.",

The food is usually great quality and tasty. Not today.  -The veggies were cut really bad and unevenly sized. Like some of them were huge and others were barely there. So they weren't all cooked the same. (some huge carrots, some noodle like carrots) -Pork & Vegetables... where's the pork? -Egg Rolls... Tasted unlike any egg roll I've ever had, can't put my finger on what was wrong. -Crab Puffs... this was the most disappointing part... There was NO crab!! The menu says CRAB PUFFS.

    "text": "Wow...ok let me just start with the staff was suuuuuuper nice and friendly. Very nice lady but wow they need to update their POS system. Now that that's out of the way, I should have read the comments instead of just seeing their over all review score. ALL of the food was very bland. Made me wish I had some MSG to sprinkle on my food. The fried rice was like no other fried rice I've had anywhere else in the world.  The spicy orange chicken was absolutely not spicy. The orange chicken was straight up dough balls with the tiniest piece of chicken. Seriously look at the picture. If there's gonna be that much dough then at least cook it all the way. Was very gooey. Kung pao chicken was very dry even in the sauce. Only thing that was decent was the free egg rolls. Go figure. I hate writing these types of reviews but this place was pretty bad. PLEASE LOOK AT MY PICTURE BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO TRY THE PLACE OUT.  Sorry king Wong but you gotta step up your cooking game and start using some seasonings.",

Gotta admit there was a moment of concern when I pulled up, but dozens of yelp reviews can't be wrong, can they? Once inside it was like a cliche of an awesome family-owned hole-in-the-wall-type place. I left a tip and the adorable lady (wo)manning the register gave me three extra fortune cookies (in addition to the one in my bag) and tried to get me to take a soda too. I want her to be my grandma.  If you live near here and you go to panda express, it's only because you're a terrible person!",

Filthy, dilapidated, just plain gross.   Now, let's get to the food. Meh. Very large portions. No substance. Ordered egg rolls, Mongolian beef (way too spicy), cashew chicken and chicken egg foo young.   Mongolian beef is mostly onions and green onions.   Cashew chicken was white meat chicken, but had no taste and like someone just tore the chicken apart. No continuity on the size of the pieces.   Now, the disaster of all disasters. This was NOT anything resembling egg foo young. This was a potato pancake with chicken and vegetables on top. What the hell is that?    Egg foo young is an egg patty with bean sprouts and chicken INSIDE the patty. This was nothing resembling egg foo young.   We went here because believe it or not this was selected as the BEST Chinese restsurant.   UPDATE:  3/6/2018. Health inspection grade of D!!!   Multiple violations including lack of hand washing and storing open meat and pork.   Most disgusting place ever.",

I waited until he showed & we ordered the King Wong dinner $15.95 per person. This was the first time I ever thought any hot & sour soup too spicy.  The King Wong (General Tsu) chicken tasted very fresh with a crispy breading.   My second visit had a couple of dishes where the fried element was not crisp and seemed like it had been cooked then held under a heat lamp",

So then we ordered again, and it was worse than the last time.  WTH??  Did they fire their cook? Not wanting to believe our fave little Chinese dive could possibly have gone down the tubes, we gave them one last shot. Mistake. It was even worse than the last two times. Don't bother eating here.

The owner must be starting to think we're a little crazy.  Each time we arrive we're greeted like family and our order is taken promptly.  It takes about 5-10 minutes before our food is ready to go...and while we wait, we've always been treated to a free drink and some almond cookies.  Gotta try anything on the menu with breaded chicken (aka. wong's chicken, lemon chicken, sweet and sour, etc), it's extremely tasty.  I haven't eaten better Chinese food since I lived in NY.  I've waited 4 years since moving here to find this place...with a lot of disappointment elsewhere.  I always appreciate restaurants who hang up recent inspection grades.  A's and B's fine by me.

I called back and said that they had already charged my card so they need to return the money because I didn't get the food I ordered. The  lady said she was to busy she'd talk to the manager and call me back and they hung up on me again I am pissed don't go to this place!",

We had asked locals where to find good Chinese food  and we guessed that they probably didn't know better, the food was horrible !! So we asked a local where we can find a lousy Chinese food place, someone said go to king Wongs we laughed and said its probably very good, the food was excellent the best Chinese food around the valley!. Close to back east style cooking. Only thing they didn't have was spare ribs, now we need to find good pizza lol and good Italian food! We found good Italian ices and the place was empty, the locals had a line at the shaved ice stand,go figure. King Wongs is excellent !.",

The dish we ordered was meant for one but you could have seriously fed 4. We are staying the night in a hotel so had to leave food behind. My only criticism is that the sweet and sour an the hot mustard were really really runny. Not sure if they were trying to make it go further or if this was normal. The crab puffs were awesome. In any event it was the best Chinese we had had in some time.  When time to leave we both got another hug. It was like dining in a friends home. Awesome.",

I loved the General Tsao's chicken: big pieces of breast meat in a perfectly sweet and somewhat spicy sauce.

If that's even possible (the sauce didn't have that good spicy tangy flavor I think it was old) the fried rice that came with it was dry and tasted like paper. The crab puff is literally only cream cheese and the chicken skewers are so over fried I couldn't even eat (chew) them. I also order veggie spring roll the \"veggies\" inside where all brown idk if it was because they were bad or it was an over use of soy sauce. They had no duck sauce but a sweet and sour sauce that  mostly tasted of vinegar to me. The people on the phone were nice but the order seemed to be really hard for them to take. The person who was on the phone with me had a hard time talking to whoever was there and asked about some of the food we were ordering. Like I said I  would never ever order from here again I would eat mcdonalds before I had to eat this.",

The food was okay, honestly this review isn't about the food I received.   Their delivery option had a six pack of 12 oz drinks or a 2-liter option, I chose Pepsi. The delivery guy comes and hands me a 12 pack box with six drinks, of ginger ale and grape soda. Not Canada Dry or Fanta, some cheap store bought stuff that sells the entire case of 12 for a dollar. I paid 4 (due to convenience) bucks expecting a 6 pack of Pepsi. The delivery guy looks at me and says \"well I don't know what you want me to do\". Dope man.  If you didn't have what I requested you could've called me to verify if I wanted something wildly different. Absolutely awful customer service.",

We ordered two entrees, after seeing Yelp reviews I really wanted to try the General Tso's chicken and I left the 2nd entree up to Eric. I told him he shouldn't choose another chicken dish but he was adamant about getting orange chicken. Well, they both came out tasting the same and pretty much looking the same. It was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. They threw in 2 free egg rolls but I wasn't a fan, I ate half of one. The portions were very large that is the truth! Definitely worth the $8 per entree.

Not a big deal as the no. 2 is nicely spiced and it is tasty, just not what I ordered or had my mouth geared up for.

At first I laughed at the Styrofoam container of sweet and sour sauce (after reading some of the comment about the 1 oz plastic of sweet and sour ....\"about the size of a thimble\")  Good job.  Customer overkill  (which doesn't happen enough when speaking of a restaurant )  But then I opened my sweet and sour pork and the sauce was not on it. The breading was still crispy and I could portion the size for myself.  And left overs (if reheated properly) would almost be as good as when they were fresh.  A few more carrots, onions and pineapples would have made this a 5 star review.  And the Kung pao veggies was a serious amount for the bargain price of  $5.50.    Ask for the egg rolls if you spend more then $9.00 and you will find that bullet of sweet and sour sauce.  The egg rolls were good to.  Not \"spring rolls\" (which others in the area give away) but honest-to-god stack-of-half dollars size egg rolls (and if you recognize the difference you know what I'm talking about).    Ten minutes and it was waiting for me to pick up.",

We LOVED the egg rolls.  They were some of the best egg rolls I've had in Arizona, seriously!  The shrimp fried rice, we ordered with extra shrimp ($2 worth).  It was only OK - rather bland actually. It needed soy sauce, duck sauce or something.  The Sesame Chicken combo ... My goodness it was disgusting.  Yuck!  We ordered take out and picked it up.  If I would have ate in there I would sent the food back because it looked gross .. but we ordered take out, picked it up and they were closing soon.   The Sesame Chicken Combo was coated in some sort of breading, not sure what it was but it was almost cake-y.  Yuck!  The combo also came with BBQ chicken .. that was NOT BBQ chicken.  I have no idea what it was .... check out the picture.  I'll stick with the egg rolls but I'm not brave enough to try the food again.",

It was a Sunday night, I didn't feel like cooking, and we were wanting some comfort food - so what better than authentic Chinese food?! A lot of Chinese restaurants are closed on Sundays but to our luck, King Wong was open and not too far down the road! Everyone else had the same idea because their carry out orders were flying out the door!   We decided to dine in and you guys, it is absolutely NOTHING fancy but sometimes the most unassuming places are the best!   My husband and I got the family meal for two for $11.95 per person and it was basically enough food for 4! It came with:   Choice of Soup (LARGE BOWL, about 6 cups worth) - We got Egg Flower 2 eggrolls and 2 crab wontons 1 large order of sweet and sour chicken (not my fav, the breading was a little thick for my liking) 1 large order of beef with broccoli (INCREDIBLE flavor) 1 large order of BBQ fried rice (MY FAVORITE!)  Um, can you say feast?!  The sweet guy working encouraged us to move to a larger table because we would have so many dishes. ha! It is safe to say that we went home with pounds of leftovers.   The service was so friendly. They were crazy busy with to-go/delivery orders and they felt bad about making us wait a tad so they brought us extra egg rolls (that we definitely didn't need after all of that tasty food!).   Anyways, our Sunday comfort food fix was definitely met and we will absolutely be back. You can't beat the family feast price. If you're feeling lazy, they do deliver! See you again soon, King Wong!",

The staff at King Wong were friendly and it seemed to be a very popular spot with the locals.  On this visit we ordered the Almond Chicken Lunch Special and Egg Drop Soup, we were disappointed with both entree's. The seasoning level was non-existent and the chicken was dry and very overcooked and the egg drop soup was the worst I ever had. Next we tried the Eggrolls and Fried Won Tons, once again very disappointed in the flavor. Our meals just weren't very good.   I love Chinese food however, I would not recommend King Wong based on what we ordered. But since there is a big selection on the menu, maybe the other entree's  are better tasting, however, Im in no rush to revisit any time soon.",

I ordered the Chicken Low Mein  was made perfectly with not too much sauce and the right texture of the noodles not too soft but not too firm. The family style fried tofu was the right touch of veggies and tofu in a brown sauce. The people here are really nice and remind me a lot of the family run restaurants with a home style touch. A gem in the desert. Frequented by the locals and regulars. I was happy I found this place tonight during by business travels. I will be back. I liked the ton ton soup and fried egg rolls too.",

    "text": "-10 stars is more like it. I had an order delivered through Grub Hub using the Yelp app. I just have to say how completely disappointing this experience was.  I placed my order at 6:03pm with an expected delivery time at 6:59pm. Then, 10 minutes past due goes by, then 20 minutes, 30 minutes and I finally decide to call Grub Hub after being prompted by the Yelp app that \"something may be wrong with your order.\" Upon calling I am immediately placed on hold. After several minutes, the recording says to call the restaurant to resolve the issue. Tried that and nobody answered. Finally, the delivery arrives a few minutes later. Driver didn't even offer an apology for the delay. Just handed the food over and walked away.  As we go to open our food we see that it has been crammed into a box which obviously doesn't fit it. My container of soup was crushed and all the liquid left floating in the bag it was wrapped in. Then after opening the bag I see that the lid was crushed into pieces and there are bits of plastic in the soup. The other bag that had our boxes of food had liquid spilled on everything inside. Made the crab puffs and egg roll soggy, napkins were useless, boxes crushed. At this point I am furious with the whole thing!!  Now to top it off the food itself was terrible. My Orange Chicken combo plate was dry as dirt. Chicken overly breaded with a rough stringy texture. The rice was so undercooked it crunched. Everything just lacked flavor entirely...  This was a complete and total waste of $45 bucks! NEVER AGAIN.",

    "text": "First of all, if you're looking for inexpensive Chinese Food, you probably won't find anything better than King Wong...  I had been eyeing this place for awhile and finally decided to give them a shot this past Sunday.  Who doesn't love Chinese food for Sunday evening family dinners?!  On this particular Sunday, we wanted to stay in vs. go out, and I was a little too lazy to make the further drive to our go-to places (Jade Palace or China Chili). So, I gave King Wong a call and placed my order:  -2 Egg Rolls -Egg Flower Soup (small) -Seafood Sizzle Rice Soup -Shrimp and Lobster Sauce (which the fellow that answered the phone said was a great call) -Lemon Chicken -Four Soldier Deluxe (a veggie dish with broccoli, zucchini, carrots) in a brown sauce -Plain Lomein (my kids are picky)  I was then given my total, which sounded low, but when repeated back to me, I thought it included everything... Since my order qualified for a free order of crab wontons or a 2 liter bottle of soda, I went for the wontons.  My food was ready for pick-up within 15 minutes and all boxed up and ready to go when I arrived.  The owner was super sweet and threw in a free bottle of water while I paid as well as lots of fortune cookies.    Unfortunately I didn't realize that the Shrimp and Lobster sauce was missing from the order until I made my way back across town to my grandparents' house where we were dining that night... what a bummer!  I ended up calling to let them know and it turns out that they forgot to add it to my order and hence didn't charge me.  That explains part of the reason that the order was less expensive than I anticipated.  (Under $40 for all of the above minus the shrimp!).  The food itself was decent but nothing I'd rush back for over my go-to places above... Still, I would consider returning if in a pinch.  If/when you go, keep your expectations in check and make sure your order includes everything you request!",

I was disappointed when I lifted open that ever so classy styrofoam lid...WHERE'S MY PORK.!! Now twice cooked pork is usually pork simmered, cut into strips then later pan or wok fried with veggies.  Taking a moment to come to terms with this tragedy. I had to know what this was so I contacted the restaurant hoping it was a wrong item. No....this is what they called twice cooked pork it's essentially plain pork chops later deep fried like Panda's Orange Chicken.  Now I'm an open minded person. When life gives you lemons make hard lemonade. So I tried it....didn't like it. It wasn't the taste, now it certainly didn't taste as I was expecting it to originally. I at least now know I don't want my pork chunks deep fried in batter.  Now the rice is okay, the crab puffs okay. The egg rolls oh my goodness they also have the pork chop chunks too....I stopped eating, because I started laughing.  The food was well cooked and crispy. The sauce on the deep fried pork chops was good. The egg rolls....not good, but they do have a vegetarian variant I should have ordered me thinks.  Will I be ordering from here again...probably. Now I already hear...\"why would you do this again..blah..blah.!\" I'll do it because they may have something I like...that's deep fried. Orange Chicken..huh. Not every restaurant craps diamonds...at Oregano's I don't like their pizza, but I love their Alfredo pasta.",

    "text": "This place legitimately earns a 1 star rating.  I have tried this place twice. Giving it the benefit of the doubt the second time when I accidentally ordered from them instead of another Chinese food place near my home, deciding hey there are sometimes one-offs.  My second experience was the worst. I ordered Mu Shu vegetables and the wrap was not a Mu Shu wrap but a tortilla. Imagine wrapping your Chinese food in a tortilla. It was gross. I also got vegetable lo mein, which I didn't discover until I got home had no vegetables in it. Huge disappointment.  The veggie fried rice was not good either, tasted like they made the rice separately from the vegetables with some soy sauce and just added some chunky vegetables to it. It was also dry.  When I called to request a refund, I was told to call back the next day as the owner, who could give refunds wasn't in. I called back, explained my disappointment with the Mu Shu and Lo mein dish and was met with conflict. The same person who told me to call back then answered as the owner, refusing to refund me, yelling at me, accusing me of eating the food, telling me she told me the vegetable lo mein wouldn't have vegetables in it, and saying no one has ever complained about the food, after I told her I did not want her to replace my dishes but instead wanted my money back.   Here are a picture of my dishes, that I ordered yesterday for you to see for yourself.",

It's a family owned and run lil almost-dive restaurant. They seem to do most of their business via take-out and delivery, but there are a few tables to eat in.   The food is awesome! It tastes great! This place only comes in second (in my personal experience) to a Chinese restaurant in Anchorage Alaska. We had Sesame Chicken, Lo Mein, a beef dish, and an order crab wontons (which were free with a coupon given with the menu). The portions are huge! We ate our fill and still had enough for two people to have full servings for lunch the next day. I can't recommend this enough!  We will definitely be back....and plan on working our way through the menu. :)",

I normally stick with Moo Shu, which I personally think they do a great job making, but once when I wanted to order beef with snow peas, I asked \"what exactly is in it?\" before ordering.  The response was \"beef, snow peas!\" (Duh!)  Well, I ordered it.  Once I opened up the container there it was... beef and snow peas... and a damned boatload of the usual, awful 'canned' bunch of tiny corn, bamboo shoots, carrots, some onion and of all things, green pepper.  So a word to the wise:  BE SPECIFIC AND INSIST ON WHAT YOU WANT!  The only suggestion I have for King Wongs, is for them to be REALLY daring, and start keeping Duck Sauce around for those great egg rolls they serve!    You must be buying that sweet and sour sauce BS by the 55-gallon drum, and it's the worst stuff you can use to ruin a decent egg roll!  Back to the first sentence of my review - it's why they're my go-to Chinese delivery!",

I ordered beef w snow peas, house chicken extra spicy, and egg rolls w no sweet and sour sauce but extra extra hot mustard.  I got beef with vegetables that admittedly DID have a few snow peas in it, but had lots more of other soggy vegetables instead to go with the chewy beef.  The house chicken was more like a general tsao even though Id asked for a recommend for  chicken dish w a savory BROWN sauce, and it had little to no heat to it at all.  The egg rolls were fine but i got about a gallon of sns sauce and 2 measly packets of hot mustard, that barely gets me thru one egg roll.  They threw in 2 extra egg rolls, but without enough of my preferred condiment that Id specifically requested, the gesture just didnt go far enough to make up for everything else.   I I was truly optimistic about trying this place out after reading other Yelp reviews, but ended up simply disappointed overall.",

It was a real hole in the wall but that never deterred us before, sometimes you find some real gems.  The staff was very friendly and attentive which is always a big plus.  Now the menu is cheap so right off the bat I didn't have my expectations very high.  When I go to a questionable Chinese place for the 1st time I usually get teriyaki chicken to be safe.  When my chicken arrived it looked strange.  The chicken was cooked fine but the sauce was very light, like an amber color.  When I tasted it I discovered that they had either used a really cheap sauce or ran out and used maple syrup because it seriously tasted like Log Cabin on my chicken.  Also the fried rice tasted a tad burned and was very dry.  Since the meal was so cheap and since the staff was so nice we just laughed about it and honestly It wasn't the end of the world.  Will not return since China Chili is closer and much better.",

I have probably driven by it hundreds of times while going up 32nd St. after passing McDowell but before Thomas but never payed any mind to it.   I gave it three stars and some easy fixes could make it four. To start the young woman answering the phone was friendly, smart and helpful. I told her I was on yelp looking at pictures of previous menus since the old website was dead(just submitted request for yelp mod to update). She told me the new site and helped me pick dishes and said food ready will be ready in less than ten minutes. When I get there it was ready but since they have only have two phone lines I had to wait 5-10 minutes until the card could be processed. The majority of the crew is Asian the manager/owner looks to be something other than Asian , likely eastern European middle Eastern. He was taking an order and someone in house was talking on the other line so no way to have my payment go through. He apologized and thanked me for my patience.    Ordered Spicy chicken wings came with free egg rolls. Beijing style Hot & Sour Chichken and Mongolian Beef. Came out to about 20 bucks.   Wings appeared fried with very light batter and some type of chili sauce drizzled across the top. Though it doesnt sound exciting I would get it again. The egg rolls were big and even though they were free I wouldn't mind paying for them next time. The chicken dish had like an orange chicken vibe more doughy not a lotta flavor. As you can see very generous portion but not my style. The mongolian beef had a good sauce and as you can see is mostly white onions shallots and beef. The beef was cooked right decent cut but I onions to beef ratio was opposite of what I expected.   I hope to find some new dishes to try that I like.",

She said they have fast delivery but we decided to go out. Ordered beef w snow peas, & cashew chicken and steamed rice. The really friendly waitress offered us egg flower soup. It was yummy with crspy fried wonton strips. The food plates were huge. Nothing special but delicious portions with lots of fresh, crispy vegetables and lots of meat. Tender beef slices and large moist chicken breastfeeding meat. We were stuffed and only ate half!  Dinner for two was $16.95, you can't beat that. Give them a taste.",

Whether it's throwing in a free appetizer or soda, or making sure you have water for your ride home, when you come here you are family. And this is just their customer service!  Their food is always great! We usually get a few enteees and a side of lo mein. No matter what enteee we get it has been great. The batter on the orange chicken is perfect. The vegetables are always fresh!   My 6 year old daughter requests to come here weekly!",

But the fried rice is incredibly salty, the egg rolls are weird, and the chicken is all covered in that weird puffy batter that no sauce can fully hide.  If you are desperate, they're your best option for Sunday night delivery, but try not to put yourself in that situation.",

The place doesn't look fancy but we are there for a decent Chinese lunch and King Wong certainly delivered what we are looking for. Highly recommended Mongolian beef and chicken with garlic if you are a chilli person!",

The employees are very friendly specially (Chen) I believe that's how it's spelled if not I apologize but he's amazing and very friendly makes ordering there even better. We normally do delivery and so far it's always ready in 30min which is amazing. And they always throw in free food depending on the amount of money you spend. We've ordered for the past 4 years and they haven't gotten any of my orders wrong so that's a big plus!! Their house fried rice is the best!!",
