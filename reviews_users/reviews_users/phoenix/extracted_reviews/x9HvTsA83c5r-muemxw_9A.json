    "text": "This is a solid, clean, family-owned Thai restaurant in central Phoenix(Arcadia).   I can't rate it higher because Malee's is too far a superior choice for me, and using Malee's as the 5-star standard for Phoenix Thai food, this instinctively comes in at a 3, which is my standard for \"good\", aka, I'm not complaining but I'm not blown away either. One of my staples at all Thai restaurants is the tom kha gai soup, and the one here is, again, good.   The atmosphere is typical of any local neighborhood favorite. The decor is nothing special. It was fairly crowded on a weeknight, signaling its popularity with local residents who know where to go when they get a Thai craving. The service is typical family-owned friendly.",

I always order the same dish at every Thai restaurant (pad Thai) so it gives me a good basis for comparison.  The pad Thai here was a bit soupy, and was severely lacking in veggies. It didn't come with tofu either, which was too bad (all of the other vegetarian dishes did, however). It seemed to be made up of sauce and bean sprouts, with a few noodles thrown in.   I wouldn't rush out to this place. There are plenty of other phenomenal Thai joints around.",

    "text": "Now that is some spicy Thai food!  When it comes to choosing Asian in Phoenix one usually has to be pretty selective.  Thai Lahna takes away some of that selective pressure.    As an appetizer we had the Chicken Satay.  It was okay but didn't blow me away.  The peanut sauce, however, was really, really good.  Which made up for the kind of tasteless Chicken Satay.    For entrees we chose the Pad Thai and the Fried Rice.  We ordered the Pad Thai medium and the rice hot.  The Pad Thai was definitely on the flavorful spicy side.  It did make me sweat and cleared out my sinuses.  The Rice was really good...Although scallions and onions in the dish made it a bit too oniony.  Next time we would probably tell them to hold the scallions back.  The rice was also like a nuclear explosion going off in your mouth.  It was wonderful!    The portion sizes were good without going overboard.  I will definitely be enjoying Thai Lahna again.    Next time I want to venture into their curry dishes.    I give this restaurant 4 Noms!",

The cucumber and onion relish was surprisingly sweet and a great counter to the heat.   Things I only liked: The Pork Kwediaw Kraphrao (mint and pepper stir fry with egg noodles) was not as mediumly spiced and could have used a touch more mintyness. They were out of Pumpkin Custard, which made me very sad as it sounded awesome.  Verdict:  I would go back to try a curry or rice dish, for sure!",

    "text": "I tried Thai Lahna tonight after my Metta Yoga session next door with fellow yoga enthusiast Steve S. It was a little after 7 and Thai Lahna was pleasantly empty. You know, there were a handful of diners enjoying their meals but the small storefront was still quiet and servers meandered around checking in on guests and greeting us when we stepped in. I thought the decor was impressive in that it was actually Thai, not just generic Asian like other Thai places I've been to. Steve agreed that it was \"Thai-ed together\" well.  sigh.  The menu reads like a novella, but of course I only have to flip to the Vegetarian page. There were two or three appealing Veg options but the rest seemed pretty bland; noodles with vegetables, broth with vegetables, white rice with vegetables. I went for #93 the steamed tofu with...white rice and vegetables, with a 'light soy' sauce. My dining companion ordered #41, a shrimp and veg entree.  Service was quick and both the servers seemed friendly enough, and pretty quick with the water refills and ice spill disasters. I thought my dinner was decent with a standard mix of veggies, but seasoning wise found it basically salty and surprisingly oily. I wasn't expecting a spice explosion but sodium alone doesn't do it for me. I would like to come back and to try a few apps or other vegetarian options, and at $7.95 a dinner its a decent wallet-friendly choice.   Oh and at the end of the meal when we were comment on the decor we were presented with two chinese fortune cookies which kind of broke the mood...especially since my fortune wanted to teach me how to say \"long time\" in chinese. yeeeah.",

We ordered:  Beef Pad See Ewe (missing that \"pan-fried\" taste, it's soggy and too salty)  Chicken Pad Thai (sauce was not infused into the noodle)  Green Curry (okay)  #29 Pork dish (i think)--too oily  Thai Tea-- Decent  Fried Rice--They ran out of crab so we got the chicken instead--nothing to write home about   No mango with rice because they were out of season. Sob Sob   We really had high hopes, but were left high and dry, plus an uneasy feeling of grease in our tummies...Sorry to contradict the high ratings, but if you are a spoiled brat and come from the land of diversity, you too will understand. :)",

When I walked in I was not greeted by anyone for a number of minutes, so I sat myself and before being greeted by anyone my silverware, a menu, and water showed up. Maybe they like the element of surprise. I ordered the #11 lunch and thought it was very tasty. The quality of the veggies could have been better, and the cheap white rice didn't impress me much, but the taste of the sauce was delicious. The soup was also very good and for $8.12 it was a cheap meal. I would say Thai Hut was a little better, the the difference was miniscule, and I did like the service much better at Thai Hut.  3.5 stars",

The waitress also did that annoying thing where she very rudely corrected my pronunciation even though she said it incorrectly, which is a really great way to not get a tip. (I left a tip anyway.) You have to walk through their kitchen in order to get to the restrooms which typically shows that a restaurant is confident in their cleanliness but I really don't think that they should be, it looked kinda gross in there.

This is a family owned and operated restaurant that's been in Phoenix for over 30 years now.  A lot of the family leaves for their annual visit home, and the restaurant is closed for the month they're gone, which is a huge bummer for me.  Whenever I go to Thai Lahna I normally get carry out, and usually stock up so I can have several great meals out of one trip.  But once in awhile I'll dine in when they're not that busy so I can get a chance to chat it up with Tom, the owner and main chef.    I've read some reviews where people felt put off by the service, but all I have to say about that is that few Americans really understand Thai culture.  Thailand is renowned as \"the land of smiles\" but what people don't realize is that although they're known for being friendly, if you're a fuss pot, act rude or pushy, they'll shut you down in a NY second without giving it a second thought.  Too many Americans are used to getting what they want and when they want it, which goes over like a fart in church in just about every 3rd world country.  So act humble and polite, and it'll pay great dividends in any establishment you go to, and Thai Lana's no exception to that rule.  If you can go there in a non-rush hour time, you'll probably get an entirely different impression and have a really enjoyable meal as well as be influenced to do what I've done, which is to make them your number one choice in Thai cuisine for the entire Phoenix Valley - or at least in this part of town!",

We live a few blocks away so when we do take out, we usually leave when it should be done - so if they say 15 mins we'll leave then to give them a couple extra mins cushion time since they're not usually super punctual. More often times than not lately it seems they've forgotten our order and don't start until we are there to pick it up. And per the other reviews - they are not very friendly on the phone and the line is often busy and you're usually put on hold (and if you're lucky they'll remember you're holding because if they don't and you hang up...cue the busy signal when you try to call back...)  Still really great food but we often make the drive to Sa Bai to avoid the hassle!",

My girlfriend is vegan and we ordered (take out) pad thai without meat/egg. It had chicken, no biggie... We called them up and they told her that it did not have chicken in it and that we would have to take it back to prove they had prepared it wrong. When she brought it back, they hadn't even started cooking the food because they believed that she was lying. We swore we wouldn't go back...   Today we thought we'd give it another go. I ordered chicken pad thai and wanted to replace the shrimp with veggies. After putting the phone down for minutes, I could hear her talking to the manager. They wanted me to get veggie pad thai and add chicken (Another $2). She told me that this is because they pre-prepare their food.   We've decided to just get thai from Sa-Bai and they will get our 2+ times a month thai fix.",

    "text": "I am not really a fan of Thai Lahna. I stopped to order off the lunch special menu.  I found it very interesting that there were NO noodle dishes on the lunch special menu.  I was pretty disappointed with that, but still decided to order something to eat.   I had the Phik King Kai with chicken, but, ironically, it didn't have much chicken.  I enjoy green beans, but the green beans to chicken ratio was not equal.   The lunch special comes with egg roll, fried wonton, soup, and rice.  The soup is not included on take-out orders.  The fried wontons are described as \"Crispy fried wonton stuffed with seasoned pork. Served with hot mustard and sweet & sour sauce.\"  However, what I received was a fried piece of wonton paper folded into a triangle with about 1/2 teaspoon of pork.  I was confused wondering if this is what they usually serve as the appetizer and charge people for it.  The whole meal tasted more like Chinese food and I was disappointed as I really wanted Thai food.    Service was pretty quick, but I just had take-out.  Thus I can't attest to their service in the restaurant.  The interior was rather dark though.  The shades were pulled down which seemed to help with the heat on the hot day, but it still left the restaurant dark.    Thai Lahna is just not for me.  If choosing Thai, I'd rather search for another place or just choose another type of cuisine rather than coming back.",

We're optimists. In fact, I don't think I've ever given a place a 1-star review. But when it comes to Thai food in Arcadia, stick with Sa Bai around the corner. At Thai Lahna, they are consistently slow at delivering average Thai food (at best). And by \"slow,\" I mean GLACIAL.   if you go, expect long wait times for basic curry and rice. If you order take out, expect even longer wait times. A recent example is when I called in for takeout -- one order, just vegetables in red curry with rice for my wife, who was working late and just getting home. She said they told her 15 minutes for a wait time, so I went over there in 20, knowing exactly what kind of service I was getting into. I took a magazine.  I was the second guy waiting to pick up my single-dish takeout order. The first guy got his order (also a single meal with rice). So did SIX OTHER PEOPLE who came in to pick up takeout after I had arrived. All of them waited, and waited. No one was happy. An hour later, I got my saucy veggies and rice. When I notified them that this was a constant problem, and that we wouldn't be coming back, the staff (who are not Thai and do not speak English) simply nodded and said something about being busy. Keep in mind that when I arrived, there was one guy waiting for takeout, and about 3 out of 12 tables occupied by couples. There was no apology.  Steer clear of here and pay the extra money for Sa Bai. You won't be disappointed. They're nice, legitimately Thai folk running a great restaurant with a takeout window. It's slightly more (about $12-15 for an entree), but you won't be disappointed the way we are every time we go to Thai Lahna. Or, if you fall into the Thai Lahna Trap, walk over to Autumn Court across the parking lot for some great Chinese food that is fast, hot, cheap and plentiful from a very friendly, enthusiastic and outgoing Chinese owner.   I think Thai Lahna would die a quick death if there was ANY other place to get decent, legit Thai food for cheap in the Arcadia/Biltmore area. There just isn't. As a result, we're stuck with this place.",

My first experience, the food was good as expected, tailoring alot of flavors to an American palette rather than your traditional Thai one. The service, like most reviews have stated, is courteous but very short handed and overwhelmed at peak dining hours.   My last and most recent visit was somewhat disappointing. My panang curry was really flavorful and packed the right amount of spice. However, witnessing bad management practices definitely left a sour taste in my mouth. I ordered take out  ahead of time to minimize the wait but ended up spending over 30 minutes waiting simply for change. Scolding an employee and fighting over who the customer belongs to is never meant for display at the register. I'm disappointed given that Thais are known to be friendly and so welcoming.",

I have easily tried about 10 yellow curries from the competition around the valley desperate to find anything that comes close.  Why, you ask?  Hands down, Thai Lahna has the valley's shittiest service.  I'm not talking about on one occasion, either.    Here are the top examples:  - Hung up on multiple times trying to call in an order - Put on \"hold,\" i.e. the phone put on the counter while several other orders taken from walk ins before me - Surly waitress who is surly every. single. time. I have the misfortune of having her for dine-in And the topper... - Picked up an order with a friend and then wanted to run an errand before going home to eat.  I'd already started snacking on mine when Thai Lahna calls and tells us they gave us the wrong order - two chickens instead of a chicken and a vegetarian.  Okay, cool, we'll come exchange it.  Still on the errand and they call again, \"ARE YOU COMING?\" Yes, geez, we'll leave now.  We get there and they demand to see both yellow curries, I surmise to confirm the incorrect order was given, then take back the full curry!  What restaurant does that?!  I waste my time and gas to remedy YOUR mistake and I don't even get to keep the mistake for my inconvenience?!  I'm giving them 4 stars because I'm a sucker for their yellow curry and I'll take shitty service in exchange for its amazingness.",

The crap they gave us was a bunch of short, pre-made crunchy rice noodles with red-dye #40 sweet/sour sauce DRIZZLED on it. Seriously????? Gross. We took one bite and no more.   2) Phaht Thai (pad Thai at other Thai places): so gross we didn't finish it! Very greasy and tasted like the sauce was made from a packaged mix.  3) Sweet n Sour Tofu: the tofu was disgusting--it's fried first, then dipped in batter and fried again. I took one bite and didn't eat any more. Massively greasy blob of gross. Sauce says it's homemade on the menu but it looks nuclear red and tastes packaged.  4) Spicy Thai rice: again--uber greasy and also not flavorful.  We will never go back.",

The service was terrible and had I not been starving, probably would have passed on lunch.  I ordered sesame chicken, which lacked any sesame flavor. The sauce, which tasted like a thickened soy sauce with a little bit of ketchup added, overwhelmed any other flavors.  The consistency of the chicken was fine and the rice was OK.  They really need to work on their timing, as there were two of us there for lunch and one entree arrived almost 10 minutes after the other.",

    "text": "I' m 100% Thai and have been wanting to eat here ever since my mom moved back to Thailand since I was desperately needing my fix. It's been a while  since I have found myself so disappointed in a restaurant. Red flag #1 was not seeing one Thai waiter in a supposedly\"Authentic Thai Restaurant\". I didn't  see the cook either, but the quality of the food and the odd ingredients added to the dishes left me wondering if I was eating at Filibertos. I had the Beef Rad Na, which was sub par. Usually the noodles are nice and fat, but thes were half the size of the noodles found at Wild Thaiger. The gravy was decent, but the broccoli was the regular kind instead of \"Chinese Broccoli\" I'm used to. All in all, the ingredients and the noodles in the dish tasted cheap. My wife had the Beef Pad Si Ew. Again, the noodles were cheap , mushy, and half the size they are supposed to be. There were also all kinds of weird ingredients added like shredded carrots, bean sprouts, and cabbage thrown in there.  Stuff you would expect at a Mexican fast food joint. The Thai Iced Tea was overly sweet and even the Fortune Cookies where cheap. You know things are bad when Panda Express not only has better food than your restaurant, but has a better tasting Fortune Cookies too. People who know what \"Good\" Thai food taste like should probably look somewhere else. I only wish I did. We came on a Friday night and paid $30 for takeout.  P.S. As we waiting for our food, a gentleman came in and asked the hostess if they had Pad Si Ew. She said the didn't have it and suggested something else. I JUST ORDERED IT AND SHE SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT!!! That's why you need at least one person who speaks Thai and understands the menu.",

The first thing I do when ever I get to Phoenix is head straight here.  Their signature dish is the Tam Kha Gai (Thai Coconut Soup). The secret this restaurant has that separates it from others is they use a special chili paste and almost all of their dishes which gives it an incredible flavor without making it too spicy (you can add more spice if you want).  And while Pad Thai is The quintessential Thai dish, the rich flavor at this restaurant really sets it apart.  The restaurant is always very cold which is nice on a hot Arizona summer day but it might be worth bringing a light jacket.",

I spoke with the owner/chef Tom and can confirm what other reviewers are saying that he is a total sweetheart of a guy. He's in his 70s and still working hard with a great attitude.  I had the coconut ice cream for desert and it was the best ice cream I've had in as long as I can remember. I don't normally order ice cream for dessert, but I'm happy I did. I spoke with the co-owner, Jane, and she confirmed that she makes the ice cream herself, homemade. It's fantastic.   Now, some of the reviwers talk about the wait staff being unfamiliar with the menu and/or not speaking Thai; I can't comment on that because I didn't encounter any issues and I don't care about the ethnicity of someone bringing me food. What I can say is that the husband and wife that own and work at the restaurant are absolutely from Thailand, speak Thai, and take pride in their food. I'm not in Phoenix very much any more, but I'll be sure to stop in again when I am.",

None of the mouth watering aromatics that normally characterize Thai were detectable either. Sorry basil, lemongrass, coconut milk and galanga. \"Mixed vegetables\" consisted of bamboo shoots and green beans (very adventurous), and the bamboo shoots were undercooked and mega crunchy. Hot apparently translates to a mild tingle on your tongue, so don't go expecting to sate your Scoville craving. And to top it all off the portions we received were meager for the prices.   I might have caught them on a bad day, but there's much better Thai to be had in the valley. Even though I live in Arcadia, I don't think there's any way I'm coming back.",

I got the #36 - I don't remember the name of it but it was a Thai curry sauce with chicken and green beans with medium heat.... soo soo good! And my friend got the #33 - a garlic sauce with chicken and onions on a bed of lettuce (I would ask for no lettuce next time for sure)... his was great as well, he was looking for something similar to a dish he ordered at Thai Rama and this one was damn near close to the exact same thing.   *Note: there \"hot, medium or mild\" sauces are pretty dead on, the hot it way hot and the medium is pretty perfect, might have an ulcer the next day but tastes great at the time.",

When my sister went to pick up our food for a to-go order, she waited there in the restaurant for 55 minutes!! AND that was on top of the 20 minutes that they said it was going to take. So, we ordered at 11 (when they opened, so it wasn't like they were busy yet), and they said it should be ready for pickup at 11:20. That's when my sister showed up. They told her it would only be a few minutes. 55 minutes later at 12:15 (I sure wouldn't call that a few), she finally got the food. I was so pissed and I wasn't even the one who had to wait there! I just felt terrible that I had talked my sister into picking it up and she was left hanging without any updates, progress notifications, etc. They knew she was there because she checked in a couple times, so what was the issue?! She's so sweet that she didn't give them any crap about it, but I just feel that they displayed horrible customer service, so I wanted to update my rating to reflect it. When we told our brother about it, he said that two weeks before he also, placed a to-go order. When he and his wife showed up to get it, they told him they had forgotten about it and that they would have to wait another 20 minutes! I guess the lesson here, is just never order the food to-go. Super disappointing. :(",

Its like walking into a Mexican restaurant and all the wait staff were Chinese. Well... now its sounding like ChinoBandito. Anway--- I digress.  I came in for lunch and the menu was expansive! I've never seen so many words that begin with K.  I wanted to try something different than my regular pad thai, curry, tom yum but I couldn't decide and went off something from their lunch menu. I think it was Thai bbq chicken with spicy sauce. I figured, I can't go wrong with that. Not traditional Thai but I couldn't make up my mind about the others.   Well, they ran out. I wasn't sure if they ran out of Thai bbq or chicken. Apparently its bbq so I settled for the sesame chicken. Bad idea. When in Thai- I should probably order Thai... but... um.. how do you screw up sesame chicken? The Panda Express has mastered it! Now you!  It will be a while before I try this place out again but I just didn't expect them to not be able to cook. I will start at a one-star for now and promise to order an authentic dish next time so I can be a better judge.  I did have the thai milk tea and that was good. So one-star for good tea!",

I ordered the yellow curry with tofu, mild/medium as my entree. That is generally my staple Thai item and it was REALLY good. Extremely flavorful and a great portion size.   The restaurant itself was pretty small and the bathroom scenario left a little to be desired, but I was certainly impressed with our quality of service.

In fact, it read more appealing on the menu, which is gigantic. How is one ever suppose to decide?  My lunch buddy and I went today to try Thai Lahna for the first time. It was pretty full around 12:30. I snagged a table. Service was prompt and we had waters in no time.   We ordered a shrimp app that was made in chili/lime sauce with mint and lemongrass. Uhm, it was okay. The shrimp is nothing to write home about, but I did enjoy munching on the bed of lettuce that was drenched in the spicy sauce. I really, really, really wanted this to knock my socks off, for the seasonings sounded like they would create an \"oh my god\" experience. What a shame.  I ordered the Eggplant Jay, since it came highly recommended. Little did I know I'd have to fight off 500,000 onions for one piece of super delicious eggplant. Not my idea of a good time. I really wish this dish could have been better. The eggplant was good - what there was of it.  My friend ordered veggies in red curry with coconut. It was pretty tasty, until you bit into a sliver of corn and about fell out of your chair from the punch of salt. Wowza.   Price was decent. The app ended up costing more than either of our entrees, which was strange to me. But, oh well. It averaged out to about $20 a person for all that, drinks and tip included.   Parking is a cinch, since it's in public lot. I had no problem finding a spot during the lunch rush.  SOMETHING STRANGE:  We weren't asked if we wanted to box up our left overs until AFTER we had paid and were getting ready to leave. I thought that was strange. But, it would have been one thing if I had really wanted to take the food home with me. I didn't.   Chance of my coming back here? Same chance as UCONN winning the NCAA tournament this year. 0%, thanks to an upset by San Diego. What a game...   The next time I'm craving Thai, I'll stick with Malee's, like Pierre said.",

We sat down to look over the menu. I already knew that I wanted to order the pad thai because that's my \"test dish\" for thai places I've never been to. I also selected the masaman curry. There were six of us and everyone got dishes to share.   When the food came out, it was a TON of food. We decided to do the good ol' Yelp Conveyer belt (chomp, chomp, give). My pad thai and my curry were spot on, and perfectly spicy. Everything I had was very good. I don't think I had an issue with anything.   So why not a 5 star review? Simply put it's not the best Thai food that I've had, but it's pretty damn close and the service was a bit lacking.   Thai Lahna is a must try if you're in the mood for some savory, spicy food!",

It's genuine, straight-forward and now oft-familiar Thai fare served in a clean, well-maintained atmosphere. It has all of the golden mom-and-pop attributes an enthusiast seeks without the (easily misguided) trappings less-seasoned Thai explorers might find distracting.  Be forewarned, the service can be slow, often frustrating. During peak times, when it's most busy, don't prance in thinking you'll get in and out in a short timeframe. Sometimes, having overly bubbly, cheerful service is, well, not necessarily a priority with the owners. Most of the time, the service at Thai Lahna is perfectly functional, and that's all that matters.  The important thing about Thai Lahna is the food. All of the curries, noodle dishes and soups, are without a doubt baseline good, and worth most superficial hardships you may incur with the previously touched on service. Even if it's not the \"best Thai food in the world,\" everything often tastes like it should.  It's worth a visit if you live or happen to be in the area.",

    "text": "Yum.  Thai Lahna has been on my list for a while thanks to Yelp, and now that I finally got around to it, I wish I hadn't waited so long to check it out. It's a cute little place tucked away in a strip mall. After reading the previous Yelp reviews, my date and I mentally prepared ourselves for good food but perhaps not the greatest of service. So we were pleasantly surprised by the friendly and attentive staff. Especially me, especially when our waitress got my back in front of my date...   She said, \"How spicy?\" and I asked her which was hotter - Medium or Mild, which my date found wildly amusing. Because I thought every place is a little different, right? Sometimes Mild is hotter, sometimes Medium is hotter? No, apparently not, according to my date. Apparently Mild is always hotter than Medium no matter where you go, and I'm an F'n spicetard. But our valiant waitress, bless her heart, jumped right to my defense, saying no, I was no spicetard, people asked her that all the time. All the time. Now, I don't know if that's True or not, but I appreciated her saying it just the same.  The menu is loaded with vegetarian options, and they'll replace meat with tofu for the ones that aren't (still might want to check sauce ingredients). Shared the sweet and sour tofu and a shrimp dish (can't remember the name) and both were equally delicious. The Thai iced tea was tasty, too - sweet, but not too sweet.",

    "text": "I got to the restaurant, looking forward to some great Thai food in the area. Lunch hours end at 2:30 (they close before dinner), and I arrived at 2:10. Didn't think it would be a big deal. When I walked in, the lady immediately told me that they close at 2:30 and handed me a menu as if I should order takeout. I asked, \"Can I eat here?\" and she said I could. I sat down, looked at the menu for maybe 1 minute, and she came by and wanted to take my drink and food order at the same time. When I told her that I was still looking, she again reminded me they close at 2:30. I should have gotten up and left figuring I was not going to have a relaxed lunch, but I did not.   The dish I ordered had a star by it, indicating it was spicy but could be modified to customer's taste. So when I ordered it, I asked if it could be prepared mild, and she said no. Okay then. The food came quickly and it was good, but they made it clear they wanted me gone quickly by giving me the check right away and asking if I wanted a takeout container while I was eating. I must have made them uncomfortable reading the New Times while I was eating. Here's the kicker--after I boxed up my food and was opening my fortune cookie and finishing my drink, some other lady came over (she put a vacuum nearby) and said, \"I'm sorry, we close, 2:30.\" I glared at her and told her I was almost finished.   Someone needs to tell them that the doors should LOCK at 2:30, but not to expect everyone to scram if they are having a meal. I will never go back.",

We were greeted quickly, and served VERY quickly.  I can't remember the names of them, but for some reason I remember the number of the items -- one being 44, which was shrimp with veggies and coconut milk.  It was great -- the veggies were crunchy, the shrimp weren't rubbery (but maybe too few of them).  It had wonderful flavor.  I would definitely get it again.  The other dish was 35, which was chicken with peppers, onions, and cashews.  It was wonderful too -- the veggies were nice and chunky, the chicken was tender, and the cashews were a nice additional texture.  One of my few complaints is that soft drinks are served in a can.  Come on people, it's Phoenix!  It's hot and dry, and we're thirsty, dammit!!!!!  Pony up the $$$ and get a fountain!  Also, we ordered the food medium, and it really wasn't that spicy.  The last time I went to La's Thai and ordered medium, my taste buds were slashed and burned -- not so at Thai Lahna.    I will definitely go back -- but order my food a bit spicier next time!",

Can't figure out what one person is complaining about saying it is not Thai.  They cook the way Thai people do in their homes, not like cookie cutter places.  Tom Kga Gai is served in flaming cauldron with floating spices so your 2nd and 3rd cups are even more flavorful than the first.  Vegetables in house made chili sauce are addictive.  Panang curry is velvety and flavorful with added spices and coconut milk.  Pad See Ew was nice and salty/ savory.  Everything is made fresh, so when the place gets full, imagine they have to hustle.  One of our run away favs!",

The best part was that it came flaming! {Great for Yelp photos! ;)} My boyfriend and I were practically drinking the bowl by the time we were done. It is definitely enough for 2-4 to share before your main meal. It is the BEST dish on a cool winter evening! Since Thai Lahna is only a bike ride from my house, I will 100% be back soon!",

We shared the egg rolls to start - beware of the spicy mustard...just a little will do, but definitely worth it to clean out your sinuses.  I had the panang curry with pork as my entree and ordered it mild...lucky I did as it seemed more like medium than mild to me.  One of my friends also ordered the yellow curry mild and it was almost uncomfortable for him.  Overall the food is great, the prices are reasonable and the service is decent.

We took one bite of the soup and spit it out. It was beyond salty and was sour like it was made last week and they we're still serving it, the fresh herbs were even brown. We eat this soup at least 3 times a month from other places so it's not like we just didn't like it, it was just that bad. I opened the shrimp and my daughter who loves shrimp immediately noticed the strong odor of bad shrimp and ran to the restroom. We immediately took it to the trash outside. I am wondering if they changed hands because the original owners used to pride themselves on serving good food. If I just didn't like the food I wouldn't write a review, I would just not eat their again. If you're going to serve me food that is beyond it's expiration date then people should be warned!",

Be sure to order a side of rice to accompany the soup.   Wontons (Kiaw Krohb) are served with a smaller than average pork. This is great for folks who enjoy the crispiness of a the fried wonton wrapping. (I personally would like more pork, but, that's just me.)  Booths line the wall with 4-top tables down the middle. Service is with a smile. However, they may be a bit strapped in coverage. But they're so gosh darn nice it doesn't matter :)",

    "text": "I have been a customer of Thai Lahna for 12 years.  The service I have received on my last three visits has been so bad, I now pledge to never return.  I don't make this decision lightly because they have pretty good food.  Last night I placed an order to go and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I arrived 25 minutes later and was told it would be ready in another 10 minutes.  After waiting another 30 minutes (a total of 55 minutes since I had placed the order), I asked to see the manager who had been in the kitchen this whole time.  I was told she would be right out.  I stood there at the cash register another 10 minutes; no manager.  I asked again to see the manager (my food order was still not ready).  From the kitchen I heard \"Tell him I am too busy!\"  That was the last straw.  I asked for a refund on my credit card.  Instead of a refund, they charged my card a second time.  While she was fixing that, my order finally came out.  I told them to keep the food and give me my money, which they finally did.  This is a place where management has completely lost touch with what service is all about.  The girl at the counter was trying desperately to help me.  If the manager had put forth even a half effort, I might have been able to shrug it off.  Her total dismissal of the customer prompts me to take my business elsewhere.  I would encourage you to do likewise.",

The coconut milk was light w/o the digusting chunks that you see so much at bad thai restaurants.  The vegetables were fresh and crisp and chicken dry yet tasty!  I can't give this place more than 3 stars however because when I asked for soft tofu in the curry they said they don't do that, they can only offer fried tofu.  It was so so absurd that I was just so stunned, so I asked \"well ok...how about giving me the tofu that you use BEFORE you fry it\". She said well we don't do that.  lol...it was so OBNOXIOUS because I have gotten soft tofu at every Thai restaurant I've gone too on west coast and east coast and even at the THAI TEMPLE IN LA!!!!  Gimme a break.  The last thing I wanted to mention was that service is very very very minimal which is fine with me.  But I did see a couple wait over 15 minutes for someone to come take their order and they were so fed up they got up and left.  The workers there didn't even bother to go after them and apologize.    I doubt I'll be back.  Way too many good places to try.  Too bad because I really like their flavoring and spices.",

I wish I was.  But I digress.  TL is that DL (as in \"down-low\") kind of place where you can just sit and decompress over a warm plate of food at the end of the day.  The hot tea is good.  Make sure to try it.  As for food...  I can only talk in generalities because unfamiliar foreign words I can't pronounce just don't stick in my brain.  So, here we go, the spicy soup made with the coconut broth is fantastic.  And the curry dishes are very good as well.  I've tried something described as being made with a \"light gravy\".  I don't recommend that.  The menu is overwhelmingly large, so it's going to take me a while to work through it.  I will report back my fave at some undetermined point in the future.",

I never experienced the snags in service that other reviews have mentioned, and every dish I tried was at the very least fresh-tasting and pleasant.  I always run Green Curry and Pad Thai as my first visit inquisition, and Thai Lahna aced them both.  Their Pad Thai is still very much in contention for my favorite in Phoenix.  The Green Curry has a great flavor, but lacks the array of vegetables that set a few other places apart.  So far, after over a dozen visits,  I have been very pleased with every dish I have tried, specifically remembering the coconut milk soup, yellow curry and pineapple fried rice in addition to the previously mentioned staples.  In all honesty, I probably feel a little more 4-starry about Thai Lahna, but because it made me believe there could be good Thai food here, I add the fifth for now.  Plus I need it to be ahead of Thai Rama, which sucks.",

The curry paste tasted home-made, and they cooked it truly thai hot.  This was the first place we've been to here that they actually listen and cook to the requested heat level.

After eating here multiple times, I absolutely WOULD NOT recommend dining in - unless you're okay with never getting service or help from either of the two ladies always working.   Here's my main problem: The menu prices are increased from what is both printed and found online AND item description are not the same.  For example: I ordered the pork egg rolls ($4.95), which are no longer made with PORK (and now $5.75)... something I was told only after bringing them back. The woman working laughed awkwardly as if caught in a lie when I asked if there was a mistake but thankfully the owner refunded the amount to me - which was less than the amount paid because for some reason they charge excess \"tax\" on items.   Don't believe me? Check your handwritten receipt and find out how much you were charged for tax. You will see at least $1-$2 above AZ tax rates... 1 star rating for unethical business practices.",

    "text": "When it comes to Asian style privately owned restaurants, most of them run into each other for me. Thai Lahna, on the contrary, is in a league of it's own. The scene is what any would expect, and the service is curt, but the food is what you're coming for, right? The portions are generous, with no shortage of protein. The sauces are so far above average, it makes the entrees at other local restaurants taste like happy meals. I'm not kidding here, if they only offered their sauces over rice I would still go as much as possible. But let's not detract from the content, all ingredients are cooked to perfection. The bamboo shoots have never been too firm. The chicken has never been too tough. The scallions never wilted.  Down sides: table-side manner (servers are all about the business here), only canned sodas, long wait when it's busy (but it's hard to hate on a place that is too busy), how full you are for hours after leaving... ENJOY!!!",

The green curry was AWESOME - but it only came with bamboo shoots and green beans. Next time I'm going to ask for extra veggies and see what happens, but even if it's just extra green beans, I'm happy with their curry. My date had their pad thai and it looked great. Yes, there are better thai food places out there (Wild Thaiger has impressive plating and food with lots of veggies), but this one is pretty close to me, and easy to get take out.",

I've tried many of the surrounding thai restaurants and most of them leave a lot to be desired. Thai Lana makes really good food. I recommend. Shrimp with chillis and mint I think is number 45 or 46 its tastey and I usually ask for one notch below thai hot so its hot but not so hot. Also I recommend the yellow or red curry. Coconut flavour and never watery just the rite amount coconut and spice. The portions are addiquete. I usually oder these two plates and invariably I always have some ledt over to take home.  A friend that is very much a steak and potatoes guy. He dosent care much at all for thai food. He really likes thai lana. In fact its been his suggestion that we dine here on our two most recent visits. The ony con I can think of is that they don't have brown rice. If they had brown rice I would give them 5 stars",

You get a small soup, egg roll, won ton, rice, along with red curry green beans, beef, all on top of white rice. Its usually an excellent meal.

Like so many culinary jewels in the Valley, the restaurant is nestled in a strip mall between a tanning salon and a yoga studio. The tables are covered in the same silks that I brought back with me from my own Thailand adventure and the staff is super friendly.   I am addicted to the hot and sour soup with chicken. It's served piping hot with tons of vegies and even more flavor. I always choose the lemon grass flavor, but I'm sure the coconut one is equally delectable. The Green Curry (#71) is also a favorite because I'm a big fan of bamboo shoots. I usually get it with chicken. I also love the #55 (which I can't actually pronounce, yet alone spell) with beef.    For lunch, the #6 will change your life. I like it with chicken and a TALL glass of water. I always order is spicy but for the faint of heart I would recommend going with the mild version.   I generally order takeout but dining in is also a fun experience. I have not had one bad meal here and the price point is right on! Take a group of friends and have fun!",

My sister started off with cabbage raps that were over salted and not good. We all placed an order for different things so that we can get a feel for the restaurant. I ordered a noodle dish.... they brought me a rice dish. I was trying to tell the waiter that the dish was wrong and they were very rude and would not help me at all. I attempted to waive down another waiter and asked for a manager and they told me that he would not come out. After that My 9 months pregnant sister was served her sweet chicken.. (now keep in mind she is a little less patience then normal in this last month so not so easy to please).. gets her food and it was cold and bland and dry. She asked for them to fix it and got push back so then asked if can then order something else. The waitress said yes and then took the order. 15 Min goes by and she asked what was the eta of her food and the waitress said that they manager told her that she sent her food back and that he was not making her anything else....... Crazy right! SHE WAS VERY UPSET, NOT ONLY DID THEY SAY THAT THEY WOULD BUT THEN THEY DIDNT EVEN TELL HER THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO BRING HER ANYTHING ELSE.  We asked to speak to a manager and then he came out from the kitchen and yelled at us to get out and leave that he will no longer serve us.   I don't care how good the food is....THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. I HAVE WORKED FOR RESTURANTS AND HAVE NEVER HAD PEOPLE TREAT THERE CUSTOMERS THIS WAY!!!!!!",

I have tried yellow curry at almost every place in Phoenix, and it is because Thai Lahna's is best I put up with the mediocre service. I have called to place my order many times to pick up after work and been put on hold which has meant any of the following (since they don't have hold, it's just the phone being put down): 1) being hung up on 2) being left on the counter forgotten about as I've heard many people place to go orders at the desk. There is one employee that has such a piss poor attitude and looks like she hates her life, but everyone else seems great. One time I placed a pick up order with a friend of yellow curry and vegetarian yellow curry. We picked our food up and went on errands. During our errands we get a call saying they gave us the wrong order and didn't include a vegetarian and we could bring it back. We said okay, we're on errands, we will. Apparently it wasn't soon enough for them because they called us back and asked where we were. When we returned they made us show BOTH the yellow curries and took one back, which I guess is fine but every other restaurant I've ever been to would let you keep the extra, and considering we drove back, I would think this is fair. Overall, I will be going back, but only because the yellow curry can't be beat.",

My boyfriend and my friend ordered their fried rice. I ordered their pad Thai (vegan) and my boyfriend did not like his rice after taking a bite of it. It was too mushy. So he wanted my pad Thai dish instead. I asked the server if he could please have my dish instead of his rice. She said let me talk to the owner she usually will make me pay for this dish when this happens. I was so concerned when I heard that. The owner is the cook, and she came out and told us we were wrong for not liking her food. I explained as a paying customer I would like another dish that we will pay for and we only had a bite of this one. I would think as an owner you would understand and want the best customer experience for us. She said that's not right but I will do it this one time. Poor server, she should go work else where and I do not see this business standing long after what I witnessed. I will never be back. Try Thai E San for great Thai food and service which is not too far from here.",

    "text": "First, let me say that the interior is just lovely and such a surprise for a strip mall restaurant. We arrived early, so there were almost no other customers in the restaurant, but this was the worst service/server I have experienced in years.   I asked the waitress if I could have mild heat if I ordered the Fisherman's Platter, or if I should order a different dish if I didn't want too much chili;she assured me there would be no problem.  She brought a flame-heated dish (the largest open flame I've ever seen set under a dish on the table--not beside it (then walked off without any comment whatsoever and didn't return to the dining area at all). When it's 105 degrees outside, I do not want a large fire sitting a few inches from me on the table, so I finally went to the back and asked her to just bring a bowl for the food and remove the fire. It still required a second trip to the back, insisting she come with me and then, she couldn't find a bowl so put the hot platter on the table and at my insistence, removed the open flame--(she had tried handing my companion a vase of water and telling HER to put the fire out). By now there was one other couple in the room, so we didn't see her again until she brought the bill.  I put the sauce on the rice--there were only a few very tiny shrimp, mussels,and a couple of rubbery pieces of squid with some bamboo shoots in an extremely hot sauce--so hot, it wasn't possible to taste the flavors of anything in the sauce--pretty-much inedible.   Maybe Malee's in Scottsdale has me spoiled,but I expected to be able to taste something other than pepper and curry in Thai food--and see more than a tablespoon of rubbery \"seafood\" in a $14 Fisherman's Platter.  Judging by the decor, someone in this restaurant cares about it, but that wasn't the impression conveyed by the waitress or the food on this visit.",

So my friend and I hopped on over to Thai Lahna to get a quick takeout order before we returned to our pints--and boy, oh boy was it quick! We were probably in and out in under 10 minutes, with two full entrees in hand.  I'm usually a drunken noodles kinda gal (I'm not an alcoholic, I promise), but since they don't have it here, I had the Phaht Sii-iiw with chicken, medium spice. It was some of the best I've ever had. Super flavorful without being salty, and everything cooked really well. I feel like often times the broccoli can be overcooked and kind of mushy, but it was done well here with still a bit of crunch to it. My friend had the red vegetable curry and was less-than thrilled about it, but said it was fine.   It was cheaper than a lot of other Thai places in the valley, in my experience. My noodles were $9 and her curry $8.",

    "text": "This place is absolutely terrible, I have no clue on earth how people rated this place over 2 stars. I am disappointed in my fellow yelpers right now. I am not even sorry about what I am going to write.   First off, I went in for lunch (lunch menu is terrible, nothing I wanted) and it was completely dead, I mean no one in there. I got the soup that was included, which tasted like chicken noodle soup, nothing that even resembled Thai flavor. There was a Chicken Bone that I bit into. I felt like I cracked my tooth and I took a picture so everyone knows, this wasn't something small. The soup was terrible, I couldn't even eat it after that.  Second, the fried wontons with pork in them was another disaster. The pork looked like something from who knows where, but it was awful. The wonton was fine, but the pork inside looked half cooked and the look of it made me want to puke.   I got the Panang curry beef. Another mistake on my part, or is it their fault? The flavor was blah except for the spice level. It was mediocre at best. There were also little pea size chunks of something dark and I couldn't figure out what it was. Some mysterious ingredient, I have no idea.   Forth and final. Not only food was terrible but so was the service. The server kept bugging me, like what hurry are you in? I have no idea what I want in 30 seconds. Then after coming by multiple times, I rushed my order and then, she didn't do anything to check on me after my food arrived. NOTHING. Why do all that work and bug me, then not even follow up, make no sense? I don't know if this guy was the owner or what, but I see a gentleman scrubbing the floors next to the disgusting bathroom and then I see him walking in and out of the kitchen. I pray to the Lord that he did not make my food after he did that. I left there and about an hour or so later, I felt like absolute garbage. Like a sick feeling.   This is terrible. I will never be back, ever.  I am done, I need to go throw up after this review too.",

This is one of those hole-in-the-wall restaurants where you've probably driven past many times but never stopped to eat.  This time, when you drive past, stop.  It's well worth it.  We had the rahd nah noodle dish with beef (I had no clue what it was, but I saw broccoli and a light gravy-like sauce in the description and thought it sounded good) and the panang curry with chicken.  We ordered both as \"medium,\" which had the perfect amount of kick for me (I'm usually a mild fan, so if you're more of a spicy person you probably want to go aggressive here).  I'd order either dish again in a heartbeat.  The flavors were great, portion size was perfect, and my husband thinks that panang was probably the best panang we've ever had.  We'll be back!",

The thing that irked me  most-the server decided to pick up my fork & move the the noodle around not once, not twice but three times to make sure there was no chicken on the plate, as if I somehow ate it before making the complaint. The server also being so for sure that there was chicken on the plate. I don't remember shredded chicken growing feet & walking away from a plate.When it was sent back to the kitchen & served again, the portion was literally half the size of the first portion.

We ordered Pad Thai and Pineapple rice so they seem have the same seasoning and overall ingredients, they just substituted rice to noodle as and added some chunks of pineapple! Pad Thai does not have peanut and freshness as you may expect. While I ate pineapple rice I ate chunk of salt, like ball of salt seasoning twice!!!!! Mentioning service, it is pretty bad.

If you don't know, typically Thai food is pricey!  The soup was really good. I think it could've used some more mushrooms and herbs to add more flavor but overall it was good.   The green curry was also good - again I think they could've added some herbs to add to the flavor but they did add tons of bamboo sticks which I love!  The pad Thai was delicious! The sauce was probably some of the best. But again - I think it could've used some more herbs like cilantro or scallions or even a lime wedge.   Overall I'm happy with this place and will return!",

I admit I get it on the mild side because I'm a major wimp, but even my friends and family have loved it at any spicy level.  On my 22nd birthday I took my friends in to try this amazing place and all of them have come running back to it!!   Whether its the curry, noodles, rice, or soup that you want, they have it.

I had to go and get someone, as no one even looked our direction after the food the served. She made me fork thru the dish to make sure there were no peanuts. Then came back to say they were out and left. I had a Thai Tea, which was good, but they never came back to ask if I wanted another or if my friend wanted another beer. Then there was the flavors...I have had a lot of Pad Thai in many different city's around the U.S. and this was not good. I can't put my finger on it but there was a spice or a flavor missing and the sauce was oily. The shrimp was cook well, but the chicken was dry and tough. I haven't written many reviews, but the experience was so lame. I won't be back and would not recommend this place to anyone. Perhaps, I am a little spoiled having lived so close to Cha Da Thai in Scottsdale. But to be clear this place is not for a Pad Thai lover.",

Soup is too salty and not much of flavor.  I don't think I will be visiting this place in the future!",

I realize, though, that I am in a bit of a rut as to what I order there and need to branch out to some of their seafood and vegetarian entrees before I can call myself a Thai food aficionado. Also, my Far Eastern journey led to the pleasant discovery of Bejarong, which comes in second.

I frequent Thai Lahna on my own and with friends... I've never had anyone say they didn't like it; even those that have never had thai food before... I live nearby, so I will order take-out often.  If you like eggplant, try the 'Eggplant Jay' - #92 on the menu.  It melts in your mouth.  If you are in the mood for soup or you think you might be coming down with something, order the chicken and vegetable soup - you will thank me!  The only negative thing I will write is that the service is not great.  They can be slow, but it's worth the wait.  Also, be patient if you call for take-out.

Thai Lahna's food will intrude into your thoughts for days after you eat here.  Like gustatory flashbacks, you will find yourself thinking about how wonderfully flavorful everything was.  We had dinner here with Christine O & Myles (+1) and shared 2 appetizers and 4 entrees.  We had Chicken Satay and Angel Wings.  The Satay was the least interesting item we had, it was merely good.  Everything else was great.  Our entrees were Phaht Thai which we ordered with no spice and Khung Nahm Prik Pow which was sauteed shrimp with roasted curry paste, onions, chili, bell peppers and mushrooms.  Our friends ordered a spicy pineapple fried rice and a beef dish which I can't recall the name of.  All of the dishes were richly flavorful and had plenty of sauce to carry over to the steamed rice.  One enjoyable highlight was the point counter-point going from the spicy heat of the rice to the almost sweet sauciness of the Phaht Thai.  We can't wait to get back here and try more dishes.  My only complaint about this place is that they need to put some sort of tinting on the windows to a height of about 3 feet.  When cars are pulling into the spots right in front of the restaurant some diners were blinded by the headlights.",

I'd rather give them some advice, although based on their customer service, I don't think they are open to constructive criticism.    I went there regularly up until Valentine's Day in '06 when I was served raw fish in my seafood stew.  They were super busy and the undercooked food would have been forgiveable if they acted like they cared, or offered to replace my meal, which they didn't.  To further break the mood, our main waitress (possibly the manager) was extremely rude to the rest of the staff and was yelling in a very squeaky, high pitched voice from the dining room into the kitchen.  I felt horribly embarrassed for all of them.  We decided to try it again - because of location.  The service was not necessarily rude, but they weren't friendly and didn't make us feel like they welcomed our business.  The food was too salty, completely masking the flavor of the dishes we ordered, and making me wonder if they salvage leftovers by re-cooking them and adding more salt (gross).  The positive reviews on yelp regarding flavor are very curious to me.  Then they acted like our request for take-home containers was an inconvenience.    With so many other restaurants in the area, including several Thai restaurants within 5 miles, we would much rather go somewhere with happy, nice employees and flavorful food.",

Again, I find the chicken is a little dry (you wouldn't think that for a soup, but, it is) presentation is really cool....they serve it in a silver, thai style bowl, with a flaming center (you generally share it with the table, all dipping from the same bowl).

Rather than getting someone to help her with the question she didn't understand, she shoved the drink menu in his face and walked away.  WOW!  We made our order, beginning with Chicken Satay.  The response - we are out of chicken satay.  So, we decided to go with beef satay.  A few minutes later, she came back and said they were out of that also.  So, we decided on the egg roll.  We were very upset to see the table next to us receive an order of chicken satay.  What is going on here?  Now, unlike every other decent restaurant on the planet, dishes do not arrive together at this restaurant.  My Phaht Thai (allegedly one of their specialties) arrived first.  I was about to dig in when they came and grabbed it away from me claiming it was for another table.  Then I watched as the dish that was on MY table was given directly to another diner.  No wonder this restaurant has so many Health Department violations.  Finally, all the dishes arrived (one at a time) and we were able to eat.  The Thai Lahna Special Fried Rice (with chicken, beef, pork and shrimp) was the best thing we had - good flavor and tasty.  Not particularly generous with the meats, but for $9.95, we weren't expecting much.  The Kai Phaht Khahnah (Chicken stir-fried with broccoli in a light oyster flavored sauce) was the next best thing - the oyster sauce was really pretty good.  Everything else made us wonder if the chef could even find Thailand on a map.  The Phaht Thai was horrible.  It was basically rubber bands masquerading as noodles and bean sprouts with a couple small pieces of chicken and 2 shrimp.  The Vegetable Curry was unlike any curry I've ever seen.  The \"sauce\" was so thin and runny, it was more like a soup than a sauce.  All in all, this was a terrible restaurant that I would highly NOT recommend.  The only thing good is the price.  Certainly not the food and DEFINITELY not the service.",

The Pad Thai uses thin noodles, which is unique and gives it a very different texture.  The pineapple fried rice has some awesome spices and the chunks of pineapple add a subtle sweetness to the whole dish.  Their curries are definitely good as well.  The appearance is a bit of a \"hole-in-the-wall\" but if that bothers you, you can always call in for take-out instead.  Service has always been fast and polite for me, but that varies based on who your server is, so I can't make any promises there.  Thai food is awesome for vegetarians, and Thai Lahna does not disappoint in this aspect.  It's one of those places where you can have a completely vegetarian meal and only notice that there was no meat after your meal.  They are definitely generous with their portions and their pricing is very reasonable.",

I sat at a table and ate my to go curry. It was a huge portion, the flavor was pretty good and it had a Ton of veggies in it! My only complaint is that the veggies were really mostly bamboo shoots, celery and baby bok choy, with a few carrots and green beans. I would have like more variety and maybe some eggplant.   The Restaurant was small and cute, I would return again when I'm in the area and craving Thai and have more time to go through the menu.  3 stars for now, until I try it a few more times.",

If she was going to douse herself, I wish she would have used a Thai tea scented perfume, or anything that would've paired better with the food. Seriously, one spritz is all you need ma'am. Also, we were given the bill before we were asked if we wanted any thing else or dessert. When we did order dessert it was plopped on the table before our main course dishes were cleared off.

This is what their chef/cook told me months ago when I was there. I don't know if this is True, but it made sense to me.   When I first started enjoying the food here the one thing I did not enjoy was the service. Orders were wrong, and the servers rarely would come to refill drinks. I am happy to say that this has all changed. The servers are on top of their game making sure that all customers are being attended to in a timely manner.   The Sweet and Sour Tofu was amazing!!!! I felt like I was having a desert and dinner at the same time. It was so good my friend and I ordered a second entree. The serving size for this entree seemed a little small, but on the other hand we get over served portions at most restaurants.   Overall I really enjoyed my meal here and look forward to coming again. Also the Tom Kai Gai or however you spell it is amazing as well!",

    "text": "Wow!  I just got home from one of the most satisfying dinners in years!  The food here is amazing!  First though, let me get the formalities out of the way....  I was actually ready to be disappointed because Thai Lahna only has 3.5 stars. HA!  I've definitely eaten 3 star Thai.  This is WAYYYY better!  The restaurant is small but not too small, and  the ambiance is mellow and  inviting.  It works.    The water is not abominable, but considering that Thai food can be very hot, investing in a good water filtration system would do wonders.  Frankly, the water was kinda terrible. Of course, I still drank 3 glasses of it. So it was obviously not the worst. Service is not gushy, clingy, pushy, or anything else that would annoy me.  They are actually more hands off than most places, but we didn't suffer one bit.  Now, to the food.  I'm smiling again because my  tummy is very happy.   We split the Mii Krohb.  The shrimp and chicken were cooked to perfection.  It was like eating chicken and shrimp flavored clouds.    We then split the Kwediaw Kraphrao with chicken (#55).  I asked for it to be Thai medium since I figured that would be about equal to \"American Volcano.\"   It came out to be just about the right amount of not quite mouth blistering heat. Every time I thought the heat was too much, it mellowed.  The mint flavoring was subtle, and there was a very light touch of anise that was a surprise, but PERFECT.  I can't really say much about this dish, except GO GET IT. Even though the Kwediaw Kraphrao is a noodle dish, we did get a side order of rice so as to not waste the incredible sauce.  Even the rice was well done and a much higher quality of rice than expected.  Just about a third of the way through our entree, we experienced a delightful event when the owner came up and introduced himself and told us that he had cooked our food himself! Perhaps this is why it was so amazing?  He is a Thai genius!!  This might also be why some people have given Thai Lahna bad reviews?  Maybe he wasn't cooking for them....  Anyhow, I was willing to skip dessert, but coconut ice cream sounded pretty good since I was cleaning my patio earlier in the 107 degree heat.  Oh.  My.  GOD.    It's handmade.  He makes it himself!  You can taste honest to goodness coconut milk!  I wanted to cry because I was so stuffed I could only eat two bites.  Please ignore the 2 star reviewers.  They're all high.  No. I'm kidding. Sorry.  But if the owner is cooking, every 2 star reviewer on Yelp needs to go back and give it another try.",

I had the pad kee mow and it was tasty and the serving size was large enough to have a take home box. The service was nothing to write home about but it wasnt awful.   The second time I came with my husband, the service was deplorable. It took us 20 minutes just to get a glass of water and an acknowledgement of our presence. My husband ordered pad see eew (I'm so sorry I don't know the correct spelling, I'm just going phonetically here) and the waitress told him that they didn't have it. It's a pretty common thai dish so he asked for it by a different name, like drunken noodles, and she said she didn't know it again and only knew \"the number\" - common for restaurants with hard to pronounce dishes. She said she didn't know the names of the dishes, she just wrote down the numbers. She was really short with us and basically belted that if it wasnt on the menu they didn't have it.   She then asked her colleague to come over to our table to again point out that they don't have the dish, and began speaking over our table to each other in Spanish.   She then left for 10 minutes when someone from the kitchen staff came out. My husband asked again for the dish he desired and the staff member knew it immediately and put in the order.   I can understand a fresh server and someone who isn't as familiar with the menu, but to be put on the floor with zero training and to be so rude to a customer really blows my mind.",

But this most recent trip after all those years made me realize it has really gone downhill.  My first and biggest gripe is that they don't even have Thai Basil on the menu.  That should be a staple everywhere and it is my favorite dish.  Maybe it is hard to get fresh basil in the desert?  So instead I had some yellow curry with potatoes and chicken.  It was okay.  Nothing special.  The rest of our meal was just mediocre as well.    Also, the Thai iced coffee had cream in it, instead of sweetened condensed milk.  That is a big fail right there!  I am sure that by now there are many many better Thai food restaurants in the Valley.  Go and find them.  Pass this one by - unless you are really hungry and stuck in the strip mall for some reason.",

We almost always opt for take out.  The decor in the restaurant is simple, and not really very impressive.  People come here for the food, not for the atmosphere.  The menu is extensive.  We have tried many of the various dishes.  Anything that sounded good on paper was equally good in reality.  We have never been disappointed.  Yes, you might have to wait for them to prepare your meal.  Quality takes time, and there are a lot of loyal customers who are calling in their orders.  So, even if they don't seem busy with patrons in the restaurant, they are super busy back in the kitchen.  My family and I have tried almost all of the Thai restaurants around town.  We have found a few good places, but we always compare it to Thai Lahna as the gold standard.  I have a dream of having a big party, ordering everything on the menu, and trying every dish that they make.  I guarantee that it would make me the most popular guy on the block, and I would get a chance to try some of the dishes that sounded good, but I never had a chance to try.  To sum it up, the decor and the atmosphere are average.  The wait time can be a little long.  But, if all you care about is the food, then you will love Thai Lahna.",

I found it a little bland...and even though it was on the vegetarian page, I thought it tasted slightly of chicken broth, so I didn't finish it, though I normal would have. Not stingy in the way of veggies, but not much flavor either...  Now, I also ordered my panang curry mild...but here, no absence of taste. No, I was gulping down glass after glass of water. My partner tried it (she likes spicy food), and told me it was pretty spicy. I made it through the veggies and the tofu, but then had to stop. Way too spicy for me.  Another think was that there are no changes. I hate onions, and was not pleased that there was no way to order any of the other dishes without onions. Their service was also incredibly slow, but I've found that to be pretty typical of Thai places in AZ.  I will say that my partner enjoyed her chicken dish, which actually came out at the spice level she asked for.  I don't know if I'll go back again...I much prefer Tips 88 and Thaiger.",

The noodles are fresh and the dish is spicy, but not so spicy that it overwhelms the flavor.  The only issue with Thai Lahna is the service. We've stopped going in and just order Take Out now because of the service. We either get really awful service, super slow service. The one Thai server that we've ever seen is actually really nice, but the others are so rude. Thankfully the food is amazing, otherwise we would not get it.  I thoroughly recommend trying Thai Lahna, your life will be incomplete without it. However I also recommend just getting it for take out.

Hey, its only a block or two from work, so why not?  We get there and are immediately seated which in my opinion is rare.  For the rave reviews, I noticed it was kind of 'dead' for a lunch crowd.  A few old people and the owners were all I really noticed.  We get a booth seat (I love booth seats.  If I could work, sleep and eat in a booth seat, I would die a happy man) so I am already getting excited.  Groovypucks and I take way too long looking at the menu and finally decide on our dishes (which we accompanied with a Thai Tea).  I asked to make my curry spicy(#36 Yellow Curry Chicken with Green Beans), and it WAS!  Almost too spicy, but I attribute that to my lack of experience with their dishes.  If I were to order it again, I would order it medium.  Groovy got a Peanut and Chicken dish (#35) with onions and peppers.  I tried a bit, as I am comfortable in my sexuality, and I really liked it.  It was Damn good! That's right, Capital D!  The service for the rest of the meal was below par, but not to the point that it was annoying.  It just took a little too long to get my food and my check at the end...  ...And with this review I leave you with my fortune  If strength were all, tiger would not fear scorpion.",
