They were both good but the red sauce was my favorite, it had a little kick to it. They also have a salsa bar and all of the salsa's are delicious. They are also really friendly, and we've experienced great customer service both times we've visited.",

The woman in the front was very friendly and helpful as this was my first time here. Since I have moved here (a year ago) I have not been able to find an authentic Mexican taco place nearby (excluding the taco truck that sits in a parking lot near 83rd) and was not willing to drive to Phoenix. This place is exactly what I was used to in California so I was thrilled when I tried it because I crave street tacos at least weekly. The meat is heated up right in front of you on the grill so your food is VERY hot when you get it. You are able to pick and choose what you would like on your tacos so it makes it much more custom (much like a Chipotle). A good small selection of salsas is available as well at the salsa bar. I will admit that their Pepsi had a bit of a funky taste to it (I think the ice) but it kind of made it just that much more authentic. Very well priced. I WILL DEFINITELY BE COMING BACK!",

I highly recommend their \"cilantro ranch\", it made the taco even more perfect. My gf had the same with a diverse mix of meat and great as well. She added the guacamole to her tacos and it was also great. The kids had the 5 rolled tacos with chicken on top, since it was a big serving the adults ending up finishing it, no complaints on the food.   INTERIOR: Nothing extraordinary, but definitely clean! Again, not your average taco shop you walk into. They have lucha libre wrestlers painted on the accent walls, pretty cool. On the back wall they have luchador masks hanging up. Perfect theme.   Overall, definitely coming back to eat here next time I'm in Peoria.",

My only complaint would be that their salsa, while delicious, is freakishly hot.  Mind you, I love spicy, and am very used to eating spicy food, this stuff melts tongues.  Would be nice if they had one that was one notch down.  Decor is a bit odd, but the employees have always been polite and the wait time is almost nothing.  Very good eats!",

The fries were delicious and my picky kids gobbled up the street tacos with no complaints. I shared the burrito with my husband and it was delicious and the meat was well seasoned. The portions are generous and prices are very affordable. The food is customizable and fresh. Beats any of the 'bertos and priced similar if not even better.  Just a warning that the red sauce they put on the wet burrito is very spicy so if that's not your thing be warned. I'm trying the green sauce next time as the heat was a bit overwhelming for me. My husband loves a lot of spice and he loved the sauce so it's more of a personal taste thing.  I do wish they had a real water machine though with ice. They just have a dispenser with ice water in it.",

The staff is really nice and the selections are great.  But I was afraid to try some items because my mouth was on fire.   Also,  we wanted to grab a pint or two of the meats but they don't sell it that way.   I hope this little joint makes a few tweaks to the spice level and I'll be back to five-star the review!",

    "text": "Yelp said it opened at 9 AM.  So we showed up at 950 and the posted hours of operation said it opens at 1000.  That's not a problem as I know Yelp is not always accurate.  There were 2 people inside setting up the restaurant so we decided to wait the 10 minutes.  At 1000 we noticed they had not unlocked the door so we decided to give them a couple more minutes.  At 1005 we walked up to the door and we're told they didn't open until 1100.  We said your hours posted on the window say you open at 1000.  We were then rudely told \"Ya but we don't open till 1100.\"  A business can open up whenever they want but not having there hours of operation accurately listed wasted a bunch of our time.  The attitude of we know it's wrong and dont care has lost it 4 local customers.",

You want street style, they have the Cilantro, Onion, cucumber and roasted salsa for that. You want creamy Cilantro dressing for a fresh Mex flare, they have that too (similar to cafe Rio flavors.) You want bowls loaded with corn and rice and meat and beans... They got that. Every thing we tried was delicious!  My only complaint is that a la cart was high in price, you have to get a plate to get a deal.",

I wanted to try one fish taco and one of another kind but if you get a premium meat you can't mix and match you have to get 2 or 3 of the same. So, I chose some meats off the standard menu and was very happy with them. Delicious green chile shredded beef and a carne asada steak taco. We also had the street tacos, red chicken and steak, super good. We will definitely be back! Also has a steak quesadilla and it was very good.",

It didn't stop there! You had an array of ingredients you could add on top. I added cilantro, lettuce, tomato, guacamole and sour cream. They're were other ingredients to add AND I had a choice of about 7 or 8 types of meat to choose in the first place or you could go vegetarian. Add in a salsa bar and you're set.

The cost of the burrito was super cheap but still delicious. They don't charge for guacamole. I got the regular carnitas burro and it was delicious. You won't regret trying this place. I haven't tried anything else yet, but I look forward too.",

But that gave us the chance to order a side of chips and jalapeno cream cheese dip, excellent. They were very courteous as we were deciding, even let us taste test the different meats. We like the green chili beef the best, but all the others were good too. The salsa bar was full, we tried the extra hot, and it was extra hot, very good. Mucha Lucas in Spanish means lots of wrestling. You'll see wrestling masks and Mexican wrestlers on the wall art. Very cool.",

The service was kind and attentive. They have a wide variety of meats and had veggie options which is an A++. I had the 3 Tacodilla's with rice, beans, and veggies which was very delicious and filling. My boyfriend had the macho fries which is their version of carne asada fries which contained seasoned fries (yum), rice, beans, and carne with your choice of unlimited toppings. The guacamole is extra which is typical for any restaurant. It was ok, but lacked flavor. They had a salsa bar with a variety of salsa's to top off your dish. I had the horchata which was tasty and not overly sweet. They have a wide selection of Mexican bottled drinks such as Jarritos (all the flavors), Coke, Sprite etc. We both enjoyed our meals and left full and happy. We'll definitely consider stopping by again next time we're on this side of town.",

Simply put, it's a reasonably priced \"fast casual\" taco shop that will probably add a bit of flavor to this otherwise \"dead\" area. And if your typical go-to spot is one of the 'Bertos restaurants, this is definitely a step up.  This appears to be one of three locations in the city and we chose this one since it's the closest to my house.  They offer a wide variety of meats for your tacos. We tried the carne asada, red carnitas, and barbacoa. The asada was, by far, the best - which often seems to be the case. I liked the red carnitas, although my girlfriend wasn't a fan. The barbacoa had a bit of spice to it, but not much actual flavor otherwise. I definitely want to return to try some of their other meats sometime in the future.  I also ordered a cheese quesadilla as an addition, which wasn't too bad. Their churros were pretty much your traditional churros - and there's nothing wrong with that.  The workers were both very polite and the food itself is very well priced.   Recommended if you live in the area.",

Their carne asada fries were so small I ordered a second  plus a horchata, I was at $23 buck's, fuck that. Forgive my language,( Mom and Dad will spank me on this one.)  Really?  2 orders of carne asada fries and horchata and I'm at $23 bucks and my second order had half the meat of my first order? that's bullshit. Daddy taught me better.   Mommy and daddy couldn't even get full because I ate the carne asada fries, but mommy ordered five tacos and they were tasty.  Daddy did say the quality of the meat was excellent, no mystery meat, no spitting out chewy rubber band crap. However the carne asada was chopped so small it was very difficult to identify it as meat.  The fries are a seasoned Ore-Ida type fries not your typical crap shoestring fries.  They charge extra for guacamole, that was bullshit.  The salsa bar was lacking and mislabeled I couldn't tell what the hell I was having No pico de gallo, no spicy carrots, but then what do I know.  They offered me rice and beans on my carne asada fries, are you fucking ikidding me?  To review the quality of meat, was very good but their portions are small and thei r extra charge for guacamole, fuck it, I'll go elsewhere.  To sum up, $9 for a half order carne asada fries and $2.50 horchata, I don't make enough allowance, ill.save my money.  Quality of food is 4 stars or better. Value for your allowance is minus 2.  I'll ride my bike to Tacos de Tijuana on 67th Avenue and Thunderbird next time. At least I can get full for $9.",

I was actually very excited thinking it would be similar food, but then I had their food. I ordered a surf and turf burrito and the macho fries (Carne Asada). The rice was terrible, it must've been from the 99cent store. No flavor no nothing and this place was ran by Hispanics! it made zero sense. Oh and the rice wasn't even orange it was a nasty dirty white color. The Carne Asada, or whatever you want to call that sorry excuse for meat was terrible. Super salty and it was not traditional Carne Asada. It was shredded almost like roast beef or Carnitas. It was terrible. I wish I would've called my Nana and gave her the $20 I wasted to make me some actual real Mexican food. I am convinced that all these reviews are from people that have had white washed Mexican food and don't know what real Mexican food is.  Tacos Kalifia is 2 minutes away, go here if you are reading this.  Wish there was an option for 0 stars because this place doesn't even deserve 1 star.",

    "text": "This place is now maskadores taco shop and no longer mucha lucha taco shop. It's a shame because this location puts a bad taste in the mouth for anyone who hasn't been to other maskadores locations, maskadores is usually a super bomb taco place, except this one.   Let me clarify. I have been to other maskadores taco shops and have loved them, this place sucks. Here is why  They have several proteins to order as far as tacos go but for whatever reason the guy who runs this place flat out refuses to let you mix and match or buy 1 of this type of taco and maybe 2 of another type. You HAVE TO buy 3 tacos of the same thing or nothing. You want 2 carne asada and 2 fish? Tough shit, they wont do that for you. The other maskadores locations dont seem to have a problem with that, for some reason these people here do.   Also, they dont have corn tortillas, they dont have flour either. All they have is some weird monstrosity of a tortilla that is half corn and half flour. It makes for a really gummy, chewy, almost noodle like tortilla that is not fun to eat. If your trying to watch your calories, the corn tortilla is unavailable.   I have noticed they like to save the scraps that they didnt put on the last guys tacos and save it to use for future customers. I've seen them cook tortillas and meat and try to feed me someone leftovers. No bueno. I gave this place several tries because I just moved to the area and away from my old local maskadores taco shop and I really wanted to like them as much, but the staff here just blows.   I really hope the owner reads this and decides to make some changes, tacos kalifia 2 minutes away is blowing you out of the water.",

The black beans are not cooked in lard which is preferred.  The food is so amazing and delicious. The quality of the food is consistent every time I go. The portions are large and I really feel like I am getting my money's worth. The staff is friendly and I feel like I am getting authentic Mexican food. The ingredients are always fresh and the meals are completely customizable.",

    "text": "Mucha Lucha Taco Shop is a Mexican FAST FOOD casual restaurant. You order at the counter and pick from about 18 flavors of fillings, decide what you want your filling in and move on to decide on toppings and sauces like you do at a Subway or Chipotle kind of restaurant. The difference here is that the food is real like HOME STYLE. The meats are mostly all SLOW BRAISED all very flavorful and spicy. They take the extra time and grill and crisp tortillas.  I went with the Three Taco Platter. There are some rules to picking what you want with the two list of meats (regular meats and signature meats). I wanted to try three different tacos so I had to go with regular meats. I picked three different chicken tacos. I thought it was odd that they offer to fill your taco with rice and beans......  Now to the taste..... (Chicken Tinga, Red Chicken, Vinegar Chicken)  ALL the tacos meat fillings are very flavorful and SPICY! All the chicken is a little dry and stringy....but ok. The tortillas are all nicely grilled. These are very large tacos that are very filled. My really big platter was only $7.25  My LEAST favorite is a redish color thats so smoky I can't eat it...It taste like a Chipotle laced ashtray to me. (my husband didn't mind woofing it down for me...)  I wasn't too found of the other one that was sort of orange.  I liked maybe the one they called Vinegar Chicken (the only one that wasn't orange or red) This one had a nice balance of flavors and a really good heat to it. I would have enjoyed the taco more if I skipped the rice...(I already skipped the beans) On it's own the rice was ok but I didn't enjoy the taste of the rice in the tacos....It just doesn't work for me.   My husband had the Street Taco Plate. It was 5 small double shelled tacos. He picked all different beef and pork tacos. He enjoyed them all! and he also enjoyed the chipotle super smoky Taco I couldn't eat.  Same as most other restaurants  You are going to like some things more than other things.  Still a good value.  3.5",

The carne asada was good but had an interesting taste to me. Not sure if i got a different kind of carne or what but it didnt taste the usual to me. Still good though. The green chili beef... Well lets just say its straight fire! It really was hot as hell and this is coming from someone who loves spice. Very tasty but maybe a warning to newbies lol. Fiance ordered rolled tacos and they came filled with some kind of white substance.. Potato maybe? Then topped with chicken and other toppings as per request. They were absouletly delicious. Unlike anything I've ever tried. If you come here get the liter coke in the glass. Nothing like it. Overall, great place. Ill be back. Very affordable and tasty. Jalapeno cream cheese was great!",

MLTS is an indoor shop so they offer more than just street tacos if you're looking for something else. They also serve breakfast in the mornings.   Of course I got an order of street tacos (5 tacos) and I was able to pick any kind of meat I wanted. I decided to go with 4 Carne Asada tacos and 1 green chili beef taco. Then, you are able to pick any condiments you want on top. I chose cilantro, lettuce, cheese, pico, and guacamole. There is also a salsa bar with 4 different types. There are Togo cups if your order is take out.   Both of the meats had very great flavoring. And the plus is that you can add any and all condiments you want",

At first, I didn't think there was any heat to the meat but by the time I was done, I could sense a bit of heat. Just enough to not be too overbearing. If you want good tacos for a decent price, this is your place.",

The inside is fairly small with a few tables here and there. Their employees were nice and courteous. The restaurant with relatively clean as well.  They seemed inefficient when it comes to making the food. The employees were running back and forth a lot and didn't seem to be following any process. Four of us came in and it literally made the ordering process almost halt. Shortly after that 4 more people came in and it look them even longer to make my food. I had to wait quite awhile till I found finally eat  Overall, I really liked this place and would recommend it to everyone to try out at least once.

Also a small space to eat-in, but the food is sooooo worth it and no more expensive than Chipotle.  Way better, though.",

The topping/filling options are plentiful! The red sauce atop the wet burrito as well as the hottest salsa options are INDEED spicy (as I love it!) so be aware of that if you're sensitive to the heat. And to top it off, the decor is adorable and the staff amazingly friendly and helpful! Can't wait to try the breakfast items next time!",

You can have them prepared in many different ways for instance in street tacos, quesadilla, Burritos, Flour tortilla tacos, and something they call a tacodilla which I can say from personal experience was very good. Careful some of the things on the menu can be spicy but if you ask they will definitely inform you which is and isn't. It's very clean inside that's a plus. Definitely stop by if your craving some good Mexican food.",

    "text": "Enjoyed this little place very much...we had the street tacos, wet burrito & super nachos.  I have to take one star off because the ordering process was very confusing & wasn't explained ( I have never been to Chipotle so this was new to me) & I couldn't hear anything the man was asking me, which made it difficult.  Be prepared to pick your meat filling & everything else as they make everything to your specifications. The menu was confusing as a result of all the choices & not knowing what was what when you looked down at the meats so a little challenging if you choose food visually...as a result things were hard to identify & I think they were insulted when I called their carne asada \"ground beef\" ( technically it was that shape/texture! LoL)  The street tacos were the best!  The wet burrito was huge with choices of hot or mild sauce on top ( we chose a little of both).  The super nachos were a little too much...could not even find the nachos under it all.  The most important thing is the food, itself, and that was excellent.  We'll definitely come back....very authentic Mexican food in a little hole in the wall type place that will surprise you with how good it is.",

As long as you go with something MILD from here you'll probably be just fine. I'd recommend either the Carne Asada Fries or the Quesadilla, both are very good and healthy portions as well.

I ordered the burrito bowl with shrimp and lots of trimmings for $10.50, it came in a 7\" tin to go and was packed with food, tasty although some of the shrimp were a tad dry. I could not finish it in one sitting. My son had the beef barbacoa burrito with lots of trimmings, that puppy was heavy and good according to the teenage human vacuum, $8. My husband also had the burrito bowl, red chicken with cilantro lime rice, tasty but that same 7\" container was only half full, $8.50, for a big man very disappointing. They put in 2 1/2 small bags of chip we were not expecting, but no salsa?? I like that they offer fish and grilled at that, worth the extra $2 for not the same old, same old. The taco shop is new and tucked away in the Bashas shopping center, it would be useful to let folks know that on Yelp so they can find it. Will we try it again, not sure, they have tons of competition and our first experience was with mixed reviews, looks like a family operation, hopefully they read their reviews.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time today.   It is not a fast food place - it is a quality food place.   The lady helping up let us try the meet prior to choosing which was awesome.   They have LOTS of meat to choose to get in your tacos.  The food  was soooo yummy.   My other half is a picky food eater so being able to pick toppings as you went was great for her.   We both got five street tacos.   I tried horchata for the first time and liked it.   The service was warm and friendly.",

    "text": "Do you like flavor?! Do you enjoy flavors that are not the same as everywhere else? Not your typical mix of meats and beans...this is the place! How about a little spice in your life? Mucha Lucha in Peoria has all of this and a great attitude behind the counter. My first interaction was over the phone as I was searching everywhere for carnitas...a very spirited young woman answered my question with, \"Yes we have the best carnitas please come down!\" I arrived and was shocked! The look is cool very Lucha libre which is different. She began to offer samples and stating these are recipes passed down and the flavors are not comparable! I agree they are not! I felt the love let me tell you, and if you like spice you will to. Please take samples first. Tinga Chicken, Carnitas, Carneasada, and mucho fries....horchata was delishas well. I loved the variety of the menu, it was like chipotle but authentic and spicy! I love Mucha Lucha and highly recommend the entire menu!",

    "text": "We just happened to come across this place and we will definitely come back. My husband had the wet burrito with beef green chile. He said it was the perfect amount of spicy. He loved it. The tortilla was huge. They let you chose the fillings and toppings in the same manner you do for a Chipotle Restaurant  burrito. I had the 3 flour tacos. I chose barbacoa, carnitas and carne asada. They were all good but the carnitas were my favorite. We also had the chips and jalapeno cream cheese. It was delicious!!!!!!!  We loved  everything we ate and it was all very fresh. The only thing I will pass on next time is the rice. It tasted like instant plain white rice. I would have prefered something with more flavor to match the level of the rest of the food. Overall, I  am looking forward to returning to try more things.",

I had a bandera Carne Asada burrito and some flour tacos (shared).  Everything was excellent!  Great flavor and spice balance.  Try the salsas.  I will be back ASAP!",

    "text": "Love this place! Real Mexican food with a lot of choices for picky eaters like myself. The Carne asada and barbacoa are to die for! I always suggest for newbies to get the 5 street tacos and try as many meats as you can!   I have eaten at all locations and I was extremely excited when the opened the new one by my house! So now I have a location by work and home...  This would be a 5 star rating.... However the new location on 75th ave is never open on Sundays and the hours change daily without notification. The unfortunate part is often times when I want to spend my money here and get great fresh Mexican food they aren't opened as advertised.  Hopefully as they get more established in the area they will stay open longer as well as Sunday!",

    "text": "I am always down to support a small family owned business in my area, especially when they are quality shops.  My husband and I LOVE street tacos and Mexican food in general, so we try any new places in the area and have been to pretty much all the local spots including food trucks.  We like to try a place a few times before really deciding on how good it is.  Our first visit was on a weeknight, and there was only one family ahead of us (who seemed to be return customers).  We didn't really know how the whole process worked, but we figured it out.  The couple that was working behind the counter was very friendly and took our orders.    The service is setup kinda like a Chipotle, you walk by the ingredients and tell them what to include in your food.  The menu is legible and they have delicious additions for each meal.  First time (and every time since) I ordered the carne asada street tacos (w/cheese, onion, and cilantro).  The meat is seriously tender and delicious.  My husband usually orders the carne asada burrito and gets extra meat and spicy.  He loves this burrito...not sure what else he gets in it, but it really depends on what you like.  The place looks like a little 'hole-in-the-wall' joint and is kinda hidden in a complex that probably doesn't get much business...but they bring in the business.  The 4 times we have been in the past month, we are never the only people in there.  Sometimes they get a little slow with the ordering process, but they have to grill everything up fresh and put it together.  It is worth the wait if there ever is one.  We have never had to wait more than 15 minutes to get our order.  Oh, last thing..the horchata...oh man...it is the best!  They actually make it per the 'original' recipe and you can tell it isn't just a powder mix.",

    "text": "I was interested in trying this Mexican restaurant as I've heard from my friend they had good carne asada fries so I wasn't entirely interested in trying other things on the menu when I first visited. This store is a bit hidden in the plaza with a door entry more diagonally on the side rather than straight and in front. On the outside, it was decorated with posters of items from their menus to give you an idea of what they offer and what the meal will look like. Upon entering, a man whom I assume was the business owner greeted us and waited for us to take our order. Of course we went with the carne asada fries which was made freshly fried fries topped with shredded cheese, rice , and carne asada. He proceeds to ask us what we want as toppings and there were a large variety that ranged from lettuce, onions, bell peppers, grilled corn, cilantro, guacamole, and many more. There were different sauces to add on top of the fries as well, such as chipotle and sour cream sauce. At the end of the restaurant was a salsa bar for you to eat your food with. It consisted of your typical verde and diablo salsa along with limes and more. Personally, I thought the salsa looked too watery when I was getting some salsa. Finally, we get to the carne asada fries. Once I got a bite, I was satisfied with my purchase. The fries were very good but in a different way. Because this was more of a \"build your own\" fries, it had a delicious taste to what you would usually like to eat or have with your food. It didn't taste like your typical \"good\" carne asada fries but it was definitely still good. As for the sauce, I didn't think the flavor was cold or had enough kick. If anything, I think that would be something they can improve on. Although I thought paying for approximately 10 dollars was pricey for a tray of carne asada fries, I would still come back to try their other foods as it looked and had the feel of an authentic Mexican restaurant.",

They are supposed to have 10 locations, but the cook and server at 7558 TBird are great.  They cook in front of you at the counter and putting the meat on the grill is unique and serves the food hot.  Will go back.",

    "text": "So Good!  Go out of your way to look for this taco shopped tucked into a grocery store strip mall corner. We stopped today to grab some lunch and were reminded again just how good and fresh the food is. My husband had a wet burrito with carne asada. He doesn't like the beans and rice inside, and it was no problem getting them on the side. He kept eating and after each bite saying how good everything was. I had the super nachos and they were excellent. We also got an order of fries with jalapeno cream cheese, also very good. The portions are substantial and we will each get two meals from our choices. This is a no frills, great food restaurant that you should include in your dining rotation!",
